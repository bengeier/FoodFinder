{"text":"Good food but oh my gosh the service,...... So Slow. Half of the  guests at our table are plastered. To slow and the folks are drinking to much"}
{"text":"This is probably my Favorite Brunch Place when in South Carolina. celebrated my mom's birthday last Sunday December. The staff from the hostess,servers and the chef could t be more accommodating. Thank you Rachelle, Trevor and Chef Neil for the great time and the great experience at The Fish Market. The shout goes to the Omelette chef for being so creative in mastering of the Omelette Station he really made it his own.  Job well done by all. BTW I love the Shrimp & Grits. just saying!"}
{"text":"I went to the Fish Market during the Charlotte Queen's Feast $30 prix fixe menu.  I've wanted to try Fish Market for a while but the prices have always turned me off.   I feel I didn't get what I paid for as the portions for the 3 courses were very small.  I was afraid this would happen as it tends to on prix fixe multi course menus.  We were very disappointed with the amount we received based on the price we paid.  Thankfully this wasn't the case at other restaurants we visited.  I started with the She Crab soup.  The soup was phenomenal.  I could have ate an entire meal of only this soup.  However like I mentioned above the portion was minute and I would guess I was served  less than 1/4 of a cup.  My Entree was the Pan-Seared Mahi Mahi .  The fish was ok.  I've had much flavorful Mahi Mahi at other establishments.  The lobster risotto was very good and my date's favorite dish.  The Pecan Pie tasted like a basic run of the mill store bought pie.  It was probably the largest portion of the night.  The service was inconsistent.  We received our first 2 courses in a reasonable amount of time but we rarely saw our server in between.  Our dessert was the longest wait of the night by far.  I wouldn't make it a point to come back because I don't think this was worth the money.  It's Red Lobster food at premium prices."}
{"text":"The first impressions are great- you walk into this big restaurant with a water feature and nice bar to the left. They have several of those huge 'gangster booths' that can hold large parties. We went for Charlotte Restaurant Week. I had the lobster ravioli which came as 3 raviolis in a dish; and they were pretty small. I had the chicken for a main and he had the mahi mahi- both were very good. I had the pecan brownie and he had the chocolate mousse for dessert. My brownie was huge but his chocolate mousse was only one tiny scoop. I thought was food quality was decent but the portions ranged from tiny to large. There needs to be better consistency with that. I'm not sure if I would go back for the regular menu."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Chicken Salad Sandwich. The Fish Market is the place for you. It has one of, if not the best Chicken Salad around. It actually has pieces of apple in it with nice chunky chicken. Just a great sandwich.   Not sure about all the other great sounding things on the menu. I've been there around six times and get the same thing.   Its a fairly new restaurant. So its very clean and has a very nice bar area. And staff is really engaging."}
{"text":"Bearing in mind that Charlotte is not exactly coastal,  you wouldn't know it by the offerings at Fish Market in Baxter Village.  I've been there a few times now  {Sat lunch,  Sunday brunch &  now dinner} and am NEVER disappointed. Drinks are reasonably priced by the glass (mixed or wine) and the wine selection is great.   But it's the food you should indulge in, not alcohol. Nothing I've had has been a misstep: anything on the brunch selections,  the burgers,  she crab soup, or the seafood entrées.  If you want to feel like you're eating with sand under your feet,  this is so fresh it's straight off the fishing boat.   Chefs here know how prepare seafood too.  Shrimp are firm and succulent,  scallops are buttery and melt-in-your-mouth, the swordfish is firm and excellently seared, the she crab soup is divine, and the desserts?  Well,  hope you brought clean undies 'cuz you'll need them after dining here.   Don't worry about the service either.   Every server is well trained and knows the menu.   They also excel at providing a recommendation if needed.   All around,  this is one of my favorite places to eat and the prices are far more than reasonable for inland seafood. The meal is epic,  and you won't feel like you've broken the bank for it,  either."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but I think it is totally overrated.  The lack of spices on the food really brought down the level of taste. If it wasn't for the $20 coupon we got in the mail, we would not have come here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sunday brunch around.  I've tried several other charlotte restaurants and nothing compares to the Fish Market on Sundays."}
{"text":"We came here last night to celebrate my husband's birthday with nine guests. Kudos to the manager Thomas and our waiter Adam  for their outstanding service.They went above and beyond to ensuring everything was perfect, including white table cloths and candles. We started out with the calamari appetizers which got very  high marks as well as the she-crab soup. All guests were very pleased with their entrees, especially the grouper, salmon and trout. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is consistent. This is an uptown Charlotte restaurant in Ft. Mill. Never been here for lunch so I can't speak to that but Dinner is excellent.  A good Seafood restaurant is hard to come by if you want to keep your money this side of the SC/NC border. Yes you can actually find it in Ft. Mill.  Also has nice outside seating."}
{"text":"I've been twice and the entire experience deserves 5 stars. The ambience is phenomenal!  The service is spectacular with a well trained staff, and the food?! The food is the best around the Fort Mill, Rock Hill area. If I want high quality seafood with beautifully prepared dishes and seasoned to perfection, this is where I would recommend. The shrimp and grits is the best entree on the menu! Please go and experience seafood and service at its greatest!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers the best and tastiest menu in town. The management is always ready to please. The service is terrific."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars (5 star for the service.... 1 star for the food.)  It's like going to a place with excellent decor and super friendly wait staff, but mediocre cooking.... I live in the NE, so I benchmark against my home for good seafood.  After the disastrous scallop dish 2 days ago, I returned for a fish dish hoping to get better results.    Well, I was disappointed again.  First I had the Cioppini (wrong spelling probably).... I was told it's like a bouillabaisse but it turned out to be more like a large bowl of hot tomato puree straight out of the can with a few chucks of seafood boiled in it.... Absolutely tasted no seafood and I could not possibly eat the dish without ending up with Acid Reflux.  So I reluctantly sent it back -  my waitress insisted it was ok (she was really feeling bad for having recommended it).  Otherwise, I'd just eat what I could to fill up for the night.     For replacement,  I had the trout dish which came in several half fillet pieces dusted with cornflour and pan fired, topped with a few cubes of pears & bacon, on top of a pile of mash sweet potatoes and a pear puree (? unsure if it was pear).  First the presentation was 1st class, but taste was not.  I had better tasting trout elsewhere.  The bread this time was dry (not moist like the last time).    For the price of the entrees (mostly $20+), I expected better.  Also, other places would've included a salad ....well not here.     So will I come back again.... Probably Not.   I discovered Captain Steve's thru a local friend and the prices are cheap and you get nice piles of sweet scallops (broiled or fried) with a nice salad for below $20... the atmosphere is more like a family dining hall rather than a classy joint like Fish Market.  But hey I only care about good food."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we've had. The ambiance was wonderful. The service was excellent. The food was amazing. I recommend the shrimp and grits and lobster Mac n cheese and peanut butter pie but everything we tried was excellent."}
{"text":"Food and service we're impressive. A little loud inside but if the weather is decent, sitting outside is wonderful."}
{"text":"Was expecting so much more. Met a client for lunch service was good but my Talapia was drowning in butter and so were my vegetables.  ..ick.  The rice was bland. However my company seemed to enjoy her fish tacos a lot. I won't be returning. Baxter is adorable."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Sunday brunch buffet, anywhere, since Charlotte offers few and the selection is mediocre. After spotting a roadside sign announcing a buffet, we decided to try The Fish Market on Father's Day.   The atmosphere was nice, even though we ate in the bar (no reservations). The food was very good (made-to-order omelet, roast beef, shrimp, etc., and a sizable dessert selection), and the price was exceptional (under $14, with $2 mimosas).  We will definitely go there again for brunch; and others have recommended it for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Despite some concerns expressed on Yelp, we made reservations and went to the Fish Market.  We had a great experience.  Our server, Anna, was great.  She knew the menu and followed up regularly to ensure everyone was okay with their food/drinks.  Two people had the she crab soup and both enjoyed it.  Two people had the market salad and both enjoyed it; the lettuce was fresh and crisp and the dressing was very light. Two people had the Carolina Trout and enjoyed it - the sweet potato puree was very good.  Two people had the Scallops - cooked just right and the bacon risotto was spectacular - some of the best risotto we've had in a long time. One person had the grouper and it was also very good.  The cheesecake dessert was great.  All in all a great meal in a great atmosphere that allowed us to catch up with each other."}
{"text":"After being a frequent guest since resturant opened, we decided try Sunday Brunch. We had horrific service, food was cold and dried up. We have used this resturant to even cater an engagement party and it was terrific. Thinking this was just a bad day, I emailed owner, Selena, and I never heard back from her.  I emailed her personal email and resturant email.  Since her lack of response, this is a resturant we will not go again.  A very frequent guest was lost due to lack of caring about loyalty"}
{"text":"The Fish Market is incredibly overrated. While there are several good items on the menu (for example the She-Crab soup is excellent), the experience one receives is sorely lacking for the prices commanded. Severely impacting one's experience is the consistently bad service delivered at this restaurant. Last night provided a prime example of this as our entrees were delayed for some reason by over thirty minutes after the appetizers were served. This seemed odd as it wasn't very crowded at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. However, there wasn't any explanation or apology and about twenty minutes into the wait I asked our waiter if we could have some bread as this had been overlooked earlier at our table. When the meals finally arrived my lobster was served without any silverware or, more importantly, utensils to crack it open. When the waiter re-emerged five or so minutes later I asked if I could get these items in order to eat the lobster. By then the butter had cooled and, once again, no apologies or explanation as to why simple steps in the serving process were missing. Sadly, there wasn't a subsequent visit to our table from anyone to address the pitiful service. This solidified for me the fact the Fish Market suffers from poor management and isn't invested in (even average) customer service. I've been underwhelmed by this place in the past but this experience causes me to remove it from future consideration. Fortunately there are many other much better dining options in the area. Baxter Village would be well served if changes were made such that the Fish Market were staffed with competent and caring management as there is no indication any leadership exists."}
{"text":"Fish Market either needs to not seat people anywhere near the kitchen or tell Chef Sullivan to stop dicking around like he's some sort of idiot rock star when he has servers waiting to serve their food to hungry customers that are watching his ridiculous shenanigans. I watched one of our plates get sent back repeatedly by our server (Nathan, who was awesome). Gah, and I don't want to know about the rag that he uses to clean the plates before they go out. I'm glad I don't have a food allergy because it's definitely the same one for every plate. And how do you run out of PASTA?! The lobster Mac was watery and please can we all agree to stop serving a Caesar salad as four whole hearts of romaine? Not a fan. Chef Sullivan you are a tool."}
{"text":"Great service and gray food.  We sampled from the Sushi bar and enjoyed every bite.  The Sushi chef customized a roll or two just for us."}
{"text":"restaurant honored reservations and were led to our table immediately, the waitress pounced on us and was rushing us to place an order before we had a chance to look at the menu. The waitress, was not experienced and did not mention any daily specials.  The grouper was ordered and came in over done, with scoop of plain white  rice, with a dollup of spinach which contained more garlic than spinace. This was hot eatable and a relacement of the spinach was just blah.  This restaurant which is supposed to know how to cook fish, misses th mark. Will not go bacvk"}
{"text":"Has some of the freshest sushi I've ever had I highly recommend. For the main course the mahi-mahi is again really fresh well prepared. The desserts are fantastic key lime pie."}
{"text":"35 of us opted to have a wedding rehearsal dinner here and we are glad we did!  Serving 35 people is no small feat but the staff handled the task with ease!  The private room was tasteful, inviting and spacious.  The food was amazing and everyone really enjoyed the flour less chocolate tart for dessert!  Thank you to the fish market and their staff for a wonderful start to the wedding weekend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to the Fish Market for Brunch 3 times - mostly due to the location and $3 mimosa's.  Mothers Day 2014 was our third and last time.  The place was extremely busy.  One would think that with as many people coming and going that the quality of food would have been better.  With the exception of the soups which were fantastic the food was \"marginal - horrible\" and warm at best.  When I mentioned that the food wasn't hot to the manager she snapped back that they were doing the best they could to honor local Mothers.  She then added that her own Mother was in the kitchen.  Normally this brunch cost $13.95 BUT in their attempt to \"honor\" local Mothers they raised the price to over $20 a person due to the holiday. We were extremely disappointed with the food and service thinking it was $13.95.  Imagine our horror to find out they charge more on holidays.  Oh yeah I should also mention that due to the holiday mimosa's were no longer $3 but regular price.  One fact was very clear - the only thing the Fish Market wanted to \"honor\" was their bank account.  If you love your Mom or Dad and want to honor them on their special day then skip this place."}
{"text":"Never again.. Terrible!!..  We went for breakfast...  The buffet was misrepresented and the food was just awful...  We called the restaurant that morning, just to see what was on the breakfast menu...  Host informed us that they would be serving, among other choices..shrimp & grits, plus quiche ...  There was absolutely NO quiche or shrimp & grits... plus they had the nerve to run out of coffee!!  WHAT                                                                                                    A couple of tables had hot plates with soggy bacon and potatoes. Smh!!! All for the price of $13.95 per person...and that's not including beverage..   We also traveled from Charlotte, NC to Fort Mill, SC for this experience... SKIP THIS ONE!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. We had seared scallops, sea bass and chicken pasta.   Raj were prepared perfectly;rivaling many of the super high end places I have been to  The staff was vet my friendly and attentive.  Anna was very knowledgeable and ensured we wanted for nothing."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant in a great area.   I had the lobster salad which was wonderful.  My husband had the shrimp and grits which he enjoyed as well.  That was our first time there and we definitely would return when in the area."}
{"text":"Loved the shrimp wraps!  Be aware there is a charge to share entree at this restaurant.  Service was excellent looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Our second visit there.  Brunch was ok. For the price.  Went back for an intimate dinner.  Very expensive Chiliean see bass was overcooked.  My husband sent it back.  We enjoyed the salad and appetizer.  We EXPECTED the manager to come over, and after TWO requests, I finally spoke with him - Thomas.  Zero ownership in the meal, offered nothing.  Said \"he had to be in the kitchen to make sure nothing went wrong\".  Where was he when our meal was cooked?  Also, something in the polenta almost broke my tooth.  But at this point?  Who's counting.  Just us. . . . out. . . . .Think again.  Try Local Dish.   Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Everything that we had for dinner was delicious. Started with oysters, both on the half shell and the baked. The baked were amazing. They had a great amount of flavor. For entrees, the seared scallops were delicious, though I do wish I got more than 4. The sea bass was a great sized portion and super tasty. Both risottos were fantastic. If I had any negative, it was the margarita key lime pie, it was just okay. The salted pretzel crust was the best part, but the actual pie needed more flavor. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, ambiance and menu! Additionally, great service - I felt like I was in a country club but for half the price!  I will definitely return with my family!"}
{"text":"The Fishmarket in Baxter is truly what it bills itself as...a unique restaurant in a unique atmosphere. The food has been great every time we've been. If you want a better seafood experience from a food standpoint, you'll need to get on your horse and head up to LaVecchia's in Uptown Charlotte...and even then, you may not do better. Probably need to go even farther, say, to Charleston, and check out Hank's before you'll find a rival any closer.   The Sunday brunch is also unbeatable. $2 mimosas and $3 bloody Marys are hard to beat, especially in Fort Mill, where several restaurants still lack the special Sunday liquor license...   Unfortunately, Sunday brunch is 100% of the business we do at this restaurant anymore...because we can serve ourselves. This is the first restaurant where I've taken off two stars for poor service, mainly because that is what precludes us from enjoying dinner here anymore. When I go to a restaurant that bills itself to be at this caliber, I've come to expect a couple of things from the wait staff...here are a few: 1) Be knowledgeable about the menu, when asked for a recommendation (I do NOT want to hear \"oh, I don't eat fish\" from a server at a seafood restaurant...go work at Applebees). 2) PLEASE come by my table more than once during a service...and that was just to drop off the bill, after one of her counterparts did the majority of the work. Wasn't sure who I was tipping? 3) Don't flirt with the bartender while you are on the clock, and I'm not being served. 4) Don't complain about how crappy your job is to other servers within earshot of customers, while those customers are waiting on you. 5) Do NOT, while I'm still sitting at the table, pick up the bill book once I've written my tip, open it while standing at the table to SEE what kind of tip I left, and then walk away without a word (don't know what he was upset about...it was a 20% tip....even WITH the crappy service!). 6) Don't be slower than Christmas, with EVERYTHING, and seem like it is an inconvenience to you when I ask for more water.   These examples are from multiple trips, and multiple different servers observed. Basically, a lack of server education/professionalism is evident at the restaurant. I wish I could rate it higher, because the food is definitely worthy. If the front of the house management does a better job hiring/training front of the house staff, we will return for more than just brunch."}
{"text":"it's hit or miss here. I try to support local places just wish I could find one where they know what good food is. It is the better place to eat in Baxter"}
{"text":"The food was fine. Nothing really stood out, but it wasn't bad either.  The interior is in desperate need of updating. Everything looks worn out and tired."}
{"text":"First time having dinner here last evening as part of the Queen's Feast with my husband and another couple.  My appetizer, she crab soup, was tasty.  My entrée, salmon, was dry and over cooked. I suspect the meals offered for the Queen's Feast menu had been prepared ahead of time and just heated up prior to serving. My dessert, a dark chocolate mousse, was ordinary.    Very disappointing.  The restaurant itself is charming and quite appealing."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. The first time I had the brunch and the second time I had a fish sandwich.   The place has a great location in the center of market street. The inside looks clean and formal (which I usually don't like this level of formal). Our server was Michael and he was extremely nice and attentive, and made great recommendations.   Brunch Pricey - but there are a decent amount of items here, and some pretty different and great like the salmon and shrimp grits (I don't like grits but these were great). They also had chicken tenders which was new to me for brunch but ok. They were great as well. The mashed potatoes were handmade, creamy and buttery. I regret not getting more. The breakfast potatoes were the best I've ever had. And they had bacon :). They also had soup (gumbo and she crab) and a bunch of other items like an omelette station, pasta salad, fruit, biscuits & gravy, etc. Oh, and prime rib which you need to ask for.   Surprisingly, the waffles and French toast were not good. They made a slew of it and it tasted old and hard. I was really surprised that this is where it fell flat. The waffles should be made fresh at the omelette station and be more of a centerpiece with some toppings to personalize like a strawberry glaze and whipped cream. Also I think it would've been great for there to be a ham carving station can the pieces they provide. The Mac and cheese was also not good at all. It wasn't cheesy, rather corkscrew noodles with grated cheese on top. For the price I would expect creamy Mac with a bread crumb topping. So for the price, I don't know if I'd come back for the brunch.   Fish sandwich - I'd come back for this. Golden crisp, and fried to perfection. I don't use that term often, but it was. The right shade and not greasy. The homemade tartar sauce was smoother than store bought which was great. Bun was soft and fresh. The fries are excellent. Really really great. Seasoned like Arby's. My wife had the crab cake lunch and the hush puppies she got...best ever. I really love 521's hush puppies, but these were amazing. Crispy on the outside. Warm and soft in the middle. I'm getting these next time. Great price and value.   Haven't had dinner here yet. Seems like more of a special occasion type of thing. I need to try their pork belly appetizer. I've also heard the sushi is good."}
{"text":"Dinner with coworkers. We tried the calamari fries, lobster Mac and cheese and crab dip as apps. All were good but I like my calamari just a tad less chewy. I had the Chilean sea bass with a side of jumbo shrimp over mushroom risotto. Pretty good meal selection. The sea bass is crispy fried on both sides. It could have been a little lighter and more flaky but still very good. I tasted the desserts of my peers and wasn't impressed by any of them."}
{"text":"Amazing  lunch during a very relax environment. . Great salad and the Sangria. Eating outside great service.  Take time sit back and enjoy"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this restaurant. The first was for brunch, which was pretty good with the usual array of brunch options. This time a friend and I went for dinner. We had reservations for 5pm during Charlotte Restaurant week. When my friend arrived she didn't realize reservations were under my first name not last name. The hostess was quick to tell her that they were booked and couldn't accommodate her without reservations. Mind you there were MANY tables open, and MANY tables remained open the entire time we were there. Our server started off pretty good, making suggestions and was pretty attentive. He was however sweating profusely which was pretty gross. I'm talking completely wet shirt, wet face, wet hands \"profusely\" which made me certain he probably dropped sweat at some point into our food or drinks. The food was overall OK. The calamari fries and the roasted tomato? bread were great! The wedge salad was lackluster. Blue cheese dressing was watered down, not enough bacon and too many pecans. The Chilean sea bass was GREASY, bland flavor wise and a pretty small portion. The risotto, which I was charged $2 extra for switching to the crab risotto that came with the scallops was nothing to write home about. Not a piece of crab in sight; not sure why the need for an upcharge! My friend got the scallops which were sweet and cooked perfectly. Not sure why, but at the end of dinner our server kept making a big deal that he couldn't do anything for us since we were celebrating our birthdays. It's like we asked him for free dessert or something (we didn't!)  but he just kept making excuses, weird jokes, and apologizing. It was very awkward. Overall a very average seafood dinner experience. I would not be in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We have gone several times and have enjoyed our food and service.  Their gumbo is amazing and we were pleasantly surprised with how good their sushi was.  Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"This place is by far the BEST seafood place in SC. I started for a client near Baxters Village for a contract and told my co-workers when asked to go to lunch that I don't eat any meat other than seafood.  The response was perfect let's go to the Fish Market. The name threw me off so I responded by asking if we were still going to get lunch because my hotel didn't have a stove to cook fresh fish from a fish market. Of course they laughed and took me to The Fish Market where I was PLEASANTLY PLEASED. I've had the following and ALL are 5 stars Crab Cake sandwich - Me having lived in MD where crab cake is the BEST should know a GREAT crabcake Shrimp and Scallop Parmasen Scampi - UNBELIEVABLE Fish Taco - AMAZING Seared Diver Scallop - SUPERB  Be sure to join the club if you plan to go often, you get points per dollar and gift cards after a certain amount of points"}
{"text":"We were around Baxter equipped with our Citipass coupon in tow with low expectations.  I generally have not had great experiences at most places around here that tout themselves as fish specialists, and the reviews were hit and miss. But at that point, my husband was at code red hunger which usually means he's mad at the world and nothing will satisfy.  Much to my relief, he ordered the shrimp & grits and I ordered a trout.  My trout had a ton of unique toppings like crab and apple and other good stuff that was really different and enjoyable. Trout can sometimes be a bit boring and the chef did a nice job trying to make up for it.  The accompaniments were well prepared.    But let's get to the shrimp & grits. Hungryman took a bite of his dish and I paused, waiting for his reaction.  He seemed to be savoring it and remarked, \"This is what I've been waiting for my whole life!\"  Touchdown!!! Exhale.  He really loved the sauce that it came with (a little more soupy than most around here) and had great flavor and he really enjoyed the sausage that came with it.    We were so impressed that we came back for Father's Day brunch where the S&G was available on the buffet. As you know, I HATE buffets, but it wasn't bad.  I might have even gotten my money's worth.  French toast, omelet station, cinnamon palmiers, etc...    The only reason I didn't give it a 5th star (because dinner deserved it) was the absolutely atrocious service we got in the brunch. The next table's waitress even felt sorry for us.  She was either new to the industry or just pissed off that she had to work in general. I had to get my own water after waiting 30 minutes. She even yelled at us for not being there one time while we were checking out the brunch line.  Also when we were there, it was $5 mimosas not $2 like Greg said. Maybe it was just for Father's Day.    Anyway we'll be back for dinner but probably not brunch. This place needs a bigger sign."}
{"text":"Our third visit we took family here because we were impressed with the food. A huge roach fell onto the table and ran across. We wound up pushing it off table with a knife. We told the waiters.....and nothing was done"}
{"text":"I can here with a group for brunch. They offer a buffet with breakfast and lunch items included by bacon, eggs, waffles and french toast as well as honey mustard chicken tenders, ham, salads, mixed veggies and shrimp and grits.   They also have a station to create your own omelette. I really enjoyed the omelette they had a good variety of toppings to chose from and it's made right in front of you!   Everything else was just okay for me. The buffet was always full and the service was steady and good.   For the price, it's definitely a good deal. A-ok in my book."}
{"text":"Went today for a business lunch. Very nice inside, incredibly friendly staff. Sarah, our waitress, was really nice and helpful. I ordered the smoked salmon croissant and it was really good: they did not skimp on the smoked salmon which I appreciated.   Bathroom wasn't the cleanest but it wasn't disgusting either.   I did not try dessert but my coworker did and it looked good. He seemed to love it.   I'd go back."}
{"text":"Good welcoming service and very good food.  Cozy ambience and relatively quiet; no problem having a conversation within our party of 6.  I had the shrimp and grits, and it was excellent; I highly recommend that dish.  A good selection of desserts finished the meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner for the first time because we usually go to six pence across the street however we wanted a change. The food was absolutely delicious and nick was out waiter he was fantastic. He was extremely polite and knowledgable of the menu. He waited on us outside even though we were the only ones sitting out there. We haven't had food this good in months. Not only is the food better than most places in our area, but the price of other places we have been in the recent past are significantly more expensive. This place is a hidden gem in Baxter village for sure."}
{"text":"Recently went to Sunday brunch and had a few observations:  1) Restaurant needs to be refreshed /renovated.  carpets very stained and in general restaurant is just showing its age.  After this number of years, please invest some money as this is an important restaurant for Baxter village  2) Brunch buffet selection is ok, but not exception by any means .  Went closer to end of brunch and buffet was unattended, except for a person making omelets in another section.   It's tucked in the back room which felt out of the way  3) outside seating in front is very cozybut has limited seating."}
{"text":"We went to the Fish Market during Charlotte's Restaurant week and let me tell you everything was AMAZING!!  It was obvious that the Chef took great pride in what he prepared.  The plating and flavor profiles shown a level of expertise that made this a 5 Star experience.  Not to mention the wonderful service Trevor gave us, who timed everything beautifully. We will definitely be back.  A+"}
{"text":"Went for a late business lunch (3pm). It was nice and quiet, we were the only ones there. The decor is pleasant, with a huge seaside mural and other fish related art.  Unfortunately the lunch was over and the dinner had not begun. The lunch bar menu consisted of five flatbread choices and a few tapas. I got a cup of gumbo and a Philly steak and cheese flatbread.  If it weren't for the scarce menu, I'd give it a higher rating."}
{"text":"Service sucks   l went July 9 ask forthe manager to complain the food was  cool and nasty of course manager never showup, l don't recommend at all."}
{"text":"Just amazing. We ended up here by mistake when our other plans fell through & it was the best \"mistake\".  Calamari fries were so flavorful and not too heavy despite being fried. The sauce on them was awesome and the slaw perfectly complemented it all. My husband got the Chilean sea bass, which he absolutely loved. I got the scallops, and I can't speak highly enough about them. They were seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly and came with this creamy bacon crab risotto, a slightly sweet onion jam & tempura asparagus. The flavor combination is out of this world and I order scallops pretty much any time we eat somewhere nice. I will probably never try anything else at this restaurant, honestly. Worth every penny, despite what some of the reviews say, especially when factor the quality and strong flavor combinations. We went on a Saturday, and the service was great. The server was friendly, fast and didn't steer us wrong with her recommendations. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Fish Market is one of the best places my wife and I have had dinner at. The service is great. The selection of fish dishes is quiet impressive for a place that is not on the beach. The sea bass is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I read the great reviews and decided to take my wife out for a nice meal ... I could have done better I guess, just not around here. First of all, I will say that we have seen this building for several years. I just never thought it was a restaurant. We actually, silly us, thought it was a Fish Market that sold you know, fresh fish. Imagine our surprise when we found it on Yelp. Oh well, after eating there, I guess it was not a big loss after all. Second of all, it is expensive. I am talking about Mortons of Chicago or Ruths Chris type of expensive. Our simple meal cost, with a tip, nearly 150 dollars. Maybe if we had stuck to tap water to drink, had no appetizers, no soup, and ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, we might could have gotten out for less, but hey, when we go out to celebrate, we want to enjoy ourselves. If the food had been great, and the atmosphere had been great, then there would have been no problem with the cost. But, the atmosphere was more like a Bob Evans, and kids were running around from table, the lights were as bright as at a Burger King, and it was as noisy as a McDonalds next to the plastic playground. Forth, the food was ok, but not great. It was comparable to a Longhorn steak house quality, with prices that are at least double, and an ambiance that is about equal. Not a great combination. We will not be back. Next time we have a special occasion, I guess we will drive to Charlotte, or Columbia so we can go to a decent restaurant. Too bad really, Fort Mill needs a decent restaurant, but alas, this is not it."}
{"text":"I love Sunday brunch and had high expectations for this place but was so disappointed.  The weather was great, so I dined outside.  My server was okay, wish she was more attentive and less timid.    The brunch is a buffet and I started off with an omelet which was the best thing I ate from the buffet and was so happy that a skillful chef was placed to prepare omelets.  I had orange juice which appeared to be a premium brand and I enjoyed.  I the biscuits were moist and warm the flavor would have been so much better.  I had scrambled eggs, bacon, salmon and ordered the prime rib well-done, both were okay but would have been great if served hot.  The cut fruit was sweet and juicy, just like you would expect.  I had a soup that tasted okay but was a bit gritty.  From the dessert bar I sampled the chocolate cake and cookies; the cake was good but the cookies needed help with the taste.  That is where the compliments end.    The french toast was cold and I requested a fresh order from the grill but was refused.  The waffles were dry and tasteless, other than throwing them out nothing could save them.  Several offerings on the buffet looked horrible and undistinguishable if a sign wasn't posted, so I did not bother to try them.  This pertained to the fried tenders with a sauce, sausage gravy, pasta salad, sliced glazed ham, mac and cheese, shrimp and grits and dessert bar.  I liked the buffet cost for what I ate.  However, since the majority of what I ate was cold from the hot buffet, I will not return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a great menu.  Have never had a bad meal the many times I've visited. The entree's are great and throwing in a salad is also a nice option.  I would highly recommend a business lunch or family dinner at the Baxter Fish Market."}
{"text":"I am SHOCKED by these reviews! In October, we took my parents there for their 50th wedding anniversary. This is a fantastic restaurant and anyone complaining about prices must not have eaten at many high quality restaurants... seriously. In Charlotte, the prices would be at least $10 more a plate. We were given the \"chef's table\" which was really nice, though my only complaint was it was Halloween weekend and there was a \"pub crawl\" going on and it was close to the bar so it was a bit loud and not quite the ambiance we wanted for an anniversary, but my parents got a kick out of it and their 2 year old grand daughter loved to watch them. We had a few appetizers - the lobster mac was decent - 4 stars. The crab fritters were a HUGE hit - yum, coulda kept on eating those - 5 stars. Entrees I had the winner - the Chilean sea bass. Literally the best piece of fish I have ever had, and I'm a fish LOVER. Nice crisp crust, delicious butter texture... I die just thinking how good it was. Scallops were a hit with my sister-in-law. Brother loved the seafood cioppino. Mom loved her lobster. Dad loved his salmon. It was truly a wonderful dinner for a wonderful occasion. It would have been nice had the waitstaff remembered it was a 50th anniversary and at least sent a dessert, but we had dessert at home, so it's all good. Definitely going back.. LOVED it!"}
{"text":"Being a frequent guest at one of your favorite restaurants gives you great insight and understanding of the food, service, atmosphere and management. I have always had great experiences at Fish Market from the food to the service. Food has always been fresh, made to order and delicious. My favorite dish tends to be the Chilean Sea Bass with Risotto, Calamari Fries as an appetizer and Creme Brûlée as desert. I often vary my selections depending on what the special is that night or if I'm in the mood for something new. The service tends to be impeccable which tends to not be the case at some restaurant in the mid price range and management takes all concerns and critiques to improve.  Now with all that being said, you're looking at my 3 star rating and saying to yourself, \"well what happened?\". What happened is my last visit, my daughter who turned 8 years old wanted to go here for her birthday out of all places for a child. Unfortunately for my family we had a new server who wasn't competent in taking orders, updating us on arrival of appetizers, meals, etc. She wasn't able to refill out water glasses without being asked, she didn't come back to check in on us like she was too busy doing something else and didn't have a sense of making our daughters birthday special. The appetizers came out cold and we asked to have them redone, she suggested to just warm them up. The food took about 40 minutes to come out and yes we had the experience of having other diners come in after us - order their food, finish their food and ask for the check before we got our dinner with a different server. The restaurant was not busy that night btw.  I asked to speak with the manager and when he came, he came with the intention of not listening to us but to tell us what he thought we wanted to hear, which was \"can we have a free meal?\" He gave us a half apology and said that he understood we were paying a lot for the meal and that he would comp the meal. But Mr. Manager that wasn't the point of us wanting to talk with you, we wanted to explain our experience to you so you could help coach the server moving forward so she could learn from it. Yet, the manger kept speaking over us and interrupting us. We had a hard time understand him due to him speaking quickly and in a thick accent. We've never had this experience before and I believe the experience will be better next time but my advice to the owners is to coach management to listen to customers and take their concerns genuinely - not as an indictment against them.  My advice to customers who are considering Fish Market for a nice dinner in Ft. Mill is to definitely give them a try - they're wonderful but unless management makes positive changes they will not improve."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is a good value at $13.95. Omelette station, delicious soups and a variety of sweet and savory dishes like French Toast, waffles, fresh fruit, shrimp+ grits, salmon, sausage gravy biscuits, honey mustard fried chicken plus desserts. It would be nice if they circulated in a few new and different dishes as the offerings have been unchanged for the past several years of Sunday Brunch- but you know what to expect when you go. Kinda like Sunday brunch at the Country Club."}
{"text":"Went there on Tuesday for lunch, started with a shrimp cocktail appetizer, were given 3 shrimp for 12 dollars, almost made us send it back.  The food wile good was almost 40 minutes getting there and the portions were relay small.  I would suggest that people skip this experience."}
{"text":"Location: Off I77 at exit 85 - Baxter Village area and there's parking in close proximity to the restaurant.  Atmosphere: Really nice atmosphere for couple of group. Very attentive wait staff but not intrusive at all. This time of year the fireplace is on. There's music in the background but not loud.  Our meals have included: JUMBO LEMON-GARLIC SHRIMP Tempura Asparagus - Heirloom Potato and Crab Hash  FILET MIGNON Roasted Cremini Mushrooms - Potato Puree - Smoked Asparagus - Demi Glace - Hollandaise  SHRIMP & GRITS Tender, perfectly cooked shrimp in a Creole butter with tasso ham, Andouille sausage, and vegetables in a Cajun cream sauce over stone ground Parmesan grits  Deserts: One is better than the other--exceptional. Love the bread pudding which is altered for the season. Example: now it's pumpkin bread pudding-cheesecakes, etc. The desert tray leaves you drooling.  Bar Menu: Plenty of wines to choose from but we opt for their cocktails which is absolutely deelish and has never disappoint in taste. They do not skimp on the alcohol.    My husband & I love this place and have introduced friends to this dining experience. You'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Brunch at the Fish Market was not spectacular.  Went for the seafood.  If it had been my 1st experience eating seafood, it would have been my last.  The salmon had that fishy taste that was just off.  Sausages & bacon were cold.  Eggs were ok.  The cook to order omelettes were nothing I could not have done myself.  For the price would have expected a whole lot more."}
{"text":"A nice place for a quick business lunch in Fort Mill or just a quick drive up from Rock Hill.  Grouper is always nice as is the southern style crab cakes.  Service is always pleasant and friendly and have taken the daughter in for a lunch and they are definitely kid friendly."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with some friends. I was glad to hear they had a buffet which consisted of an omelet station, breakfast foods, lunch foods as well as $3 mimosas! They also offered fresh cut prime rib by request. And to finish off there were small desserts plated along with an assortment of cookies. Everything tasted good, the hostess and server were friendly. Bathroom was clean as well as the rest of the place. Overall a good experience and would like to come back for lunch or dinner soon."}
{"text":"Had some friends visit from out of state and took the opportunity to visit Fish Market for the first time. Our intention was to have a drink at the bar and then eat in the dining room, our bartender DJ was a delight, he was very informative about wine, spirits and beers and was very helpful on menu choices as he knew each and every item. Even though he was very busy he still managed to take good care of us so we decided to just eat our dinner at the bar as the restaurant filled up very fast. Food was outstanding, in particular the she crab soup was the best I have had anywhere, mussels were awesome and the calamari fries unbelivable. Entrees of sea bass, scallops and shrimp and grits unbelievable. Food and service from all staff members 5 star all the way."}
{"text":"I'm an extremely picky seafood and sushi eater, and Fish Market never disappoints. I might even be their best customer, as I live within walking distance and my business is down the street. You'll find me there once, maybe twice a week because it's just that good. Some of my favorites that aren't sushi- the chilean sea bass, gumbo, beet salad, seaweed salad, their risotto is amazing, you're always making a great choice with their specials- and Gabriel the bartender makes the best extra dirty kettle one three olive martinis in the universe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the Fish Market on a Saturday for our weekly date night. We arrived around 5:00 without reservations and were seated instantly. We asked to sit outside because the patio is well shaded. The patio is quaint with a lovely view of the fountain and Baxter Village. However, the patio does need some sprucing up. We noticed a old bird's nest on the porch light and debris on the ceilings and walls. As far as the service, our waitress was wonderful. She was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. She informed us the restaurant was offering a restaurant week special. Three menu items (appetizer, entree and dessert) for $35. My boyfriend chose the special and ordered the pork belly, filet mignon, and strawberry shortcake. I ordered the steamed mussels and a caesar salad. The meal began with fresh bread and a pesto oil mixture for dipping. It was delicious. Next came the steamed mussels and pork belly. Both were good. I really appreciated the portion size of the mussels. There were more than enough to share between us. Then came the caesar salad and filet mignon. The caesar salad was standard, but good. However the real disappointment was the filet mignon. The filet came with mashed potatoes and steamed kale. The filet was room temperature and chewy. It was topped with a watery gravy overpowered by a sherry sauce. The potatoes were also room temperature and topped with the gravy. The roasted kale was also disappointing as it was oversaturated with oil. My boyfriend braved his entree as he did not not want to ruin date night with a complaint. We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake, which was perfect to share. Overall, the Fish Market is average. The service and environment are great, but given the quality of food and prices, we do not recommend it. If you decide to go, stick to seafood."}
{"text":"Was in again this past week, and I'm so suprised to read Greg G's review. Our service was, as it almost always is at Fish Market, right on point. Our server answered questions, made recommendations, was friendly and attentive without being in the way --everything you want when dining.    May I talk about the new chef?  I AM SO EXCITED about the new offerings, and the talk I hear about the new lunch menu. Where the fried (fish-camp-style) offerings ...which never made great sense to me at a place that serves exceptional seafood... is being replaced with more grilled items.   We took our (grown) son and his girlfriend for a birthday dinner this past week.  Oysters, check.  Almost thought I was back in New England, they were so fresh.  The boys ordered the She-Crab soup which is always good at Fish Market.  The girls ordered the tomato-basil bisque which I think was one of the most comforting, delicious soups (ok... bisuqes) I've ever had.    For entress -- my hubby had the mahi-mahi, which he usually gets, and it was grilled to perfection.  Son got the sea bass with the asian preparation that I've had and love.  Girlfriend got the salmon, which was so delicious, I ALMOST wished I'd ordered it. But instead -- I got the special, Grilled Sea Bass with strawberry salsa (OMGsh...amazing!!) served with basil-risotto (thought I was gonna die it was so delish) and grilled asparagus.  I am really thrilled with the dishes coming out of the kitchen with the new chef.  HOORAY!  My next question for mgmt at Fish Market  -- any cooking classes on the horizon?  Count me in."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful!  This is where I take  my friends and family when they visit. From lunch to the beautiful dinners, it is always a pleasure to visit."}
{"text":"Lived in the neighborhood for a year now and finally tried Fish Market. Wish we would have tried it sooner! Food has been great every time we have been. Service has been slow at times, but nothing ridiculous. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with a very nice spread of delicious entrees, soups, omelette station, carved roast beef and desserts. They also offer mimosas and some really good coffee."}
{"text":"Great place for lunches, great laid back bar, two for one bar food on Tuesday, I especially like the jerk chicken piaza at the bar (dough and all made from scratch). and actually it offers quite a nice regular menu and great desserts. The chocolate creme brule is the best.  Most of the food is made from scratch, kind of has a high end Disney restaurant food feel to it.  The atmosphere is eclectic and warm, the staff is great, but you have to push a little if you are on a luch hour. I will go again and again.  :)M"}
{"text":"The paella, sangria & awesome patio seat with a view of the park & Market Street"}
{"text":"The shrimp and grit here is great! The menu is a bit more expensive than similar style restaurants, but they do provide good food. It's a very laid back and wonderful atmosphere for personal or group dining. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Lunch today was Fantastic!  I was sent by the owner of the Chocolat Boutique next door!    Walk in and you are greeted by a Waterfall, with two more Waterfalls behind that, Jazzy background music and a friendly staff that took really good care of me for lunch!  This is a friendly and efficient Team!  Shrimp, Chicken and Andouli Sausage Gumbo, thick and very flavorful.  Easily one of the best i've eaten and Best in a while for sure! - Beef Chili (special not always on the menu) Was thick and meaty with a perfect flavor.   Shrimp Wrap, Spinach flour tortilla with Citrus Vinaigrette, Yellow Tomatoes, Purple and dark green \"greens\", served with hot Chips and look at this Dessert tray (photo).  If I had not already had Chocolates and getting ready to go Cupcrazed at the Cakery down the street I would have gotten Three of these Dessert, Peanut Butter Pie, Chocolate Torte and Key lime pie all looked and sounded great."}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the Brunch. After hearing a lot of great reviews on Fish Market my family and I decided to go one Sunday after church for brunch. I highly suggest making reservations as it seemed like there was somewhat of a lengthy wait. Luckily we had reservations but still had to wait about 5-10 minutes for our table.  Once we were seated, we were free to go to the brunch buffet line. The buffet seemed a little skim and needed to be refreshed with more food. There was a decent amount of breakfast foods and lunch foods on the buffet. There was also an omelet station where you could order a customized omelet. I went through the line twice in hopes to get a fresh batch of food and maybe try something else that was on the buffet as I was not impressed going through the line the first time. I got the last 2 waffle pieces that were left and a few fried honey mustard chicken nuggets, as well as some mac and cheese, sautéed veggies. There was not any more bacon or home fries at first but they were eventually refreshed.   There were a lot of dessert options such as cakes, cookies and pie. I did enjoy the chocolate chip cookies. But sadly that was about the only thing that I enjoyed during brunch.   The service from our waitress was excellent! She was very nice and attentive.   I will give Fish Market another try of dinner and update my review being that I have heard so many great reviews on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food for decent prices. I would say it is a refined Red Lobster, slightly better.  I was surprised to see that they offered sushi. We came here with a group of 8 collegues and started with raw oysters, a sushi combo, and tuna tataki. Sushi was okay. The oysters were okay they could have been more fresh. The sushi was okay as well. I had the shrimp and scallop provencal as my entree and it was decent. The scallops were overcooked and a bit chewy. Flavor of the dish was good with the yellow tomatoes. Best part of the meal was dessert. I had a peanut butter mousse with an oreo crust. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place forever. There just aren't that many great places to eat in this end of town. So trying to be more open minded to the Ft Mill/Rivergate area. Went on a Saturday evening with a reservation at 6. Didn't really need it as the place was fairly empty but started to fill up by 7. I ordered the mussels and someone else at the table order the blackened beef bites for appetizers. Neither were great. Mussels were over cooked, very chewy and tasted to much like the \"sea\". The beef bites were flavorful yet plain. Was also served bread for the table--couldn't quite figure out the herb that was in it and the server didn't know either. We also had salads--market salad, hearts of palm and a wedge. We were all pleased with these--flavorful dressings on the market and the hearts of palm.  For dinner, I ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta. Wow! First it was enough pasta for 3 people. The shrimp and scallops tasted great. Nice sauce with artichokes. While it was a lot of food for the price, a place like this should give this dish the presentation it deserves. The shrimp and scallops, which should be the stars of the dish were buried in the sauce and pasta. I would have paid the same price for 1/3 of the pasta with the same number shrimp/scallops being highlighted on top with the sauce. Again, great dish but the presentation could be so much better. It really looked like a hot mess in a big bowl. Another at the table ordered scallops with the risotto - they were pleased with their selection and I tried the risotto and it was delicious.  Last dish ordered was the shrimp and grits, which I didn't try, but she thought it had too much sauce which drowned the other ingredients.  For dessert, we had the key lime pie, cheesecake and the trio of creme brûlée. The key lime had an odd green sauce on top--it tasted odd and didn't add anything to the pie. Cheesecake was delightful. The trio of creme brûlée- regular was good, chocolate was phenomenal & the pistachio was lacking in pistachio flavor ( green color doesn't = pistachio flavor) Server was really good for the most part. I asked if they had port, he mentioned something that was not a port and I declined. I think he wasn't sure what I was asking for but he did was a server should do in this instance. He went and asked someone and came back with the menu and showed me, they did in fact, have two port offerings. Good save on his part and it added to my experience. Kudos to him! I would come back, I would not order the apps we ordered or entree selection as I think there are probably a few other dishes  that would have been better.  This restaurant says all their fish is fresh and they buy local--they should play that up on their website and menu. It would further justify their price point."}
{"text":"We frequent Fish Market and love the atmosphere, service, and wine list. The food is consistently good, and there is a lot of variety. Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"First time to eat here. Business trip, sat in the bar on a Tuesday night, had wonderful service and even better food! Great suggestions from the friendly server and great staff! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes! Had the recommended Sea Bass and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Had lunch around 1:30 pm today. My dilemma-all our food selections were very good. She Crab soup, iceberg wedge, tuna salad sandwich&fish sandwich. All were flavorful and very attractively priced. Service leaves a lot to be desired. Extremely long wait for food, drinks, however, came quickly. Waited for check as well. The restaurant was not crowded. Good food at nice price, just a heads up on the speed for it to be delivered.  Easily a 4 star rating if service was better."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, especially the scallops and market green salad, but the service is soooo sloooow. The fella goes twice a week because it's convenient, and I go with him every few weeks, and they only have one bartender working the entire bar/bar area and making drinks for the whole restaurant. Additionally, their tap lines are so dirty that they have to spend 10 minutes wiping the foam off the beer after they pour them. Order wine or a cocktail instead of a draft."}
{"text":"To begin with, I will say that the fish market is at a really good location. The entire street has a very local feel to it. Also, not to forget you definitely should make reservations before dining at this place. Unfortunately, we had not done that had to wait for whole 30 long minutes. However, the food and the service at this place covered up for it. We were almost about to leave after the wait and the manager quickly noticed a vacant table in the bar section. We began with CALAMARI FRIES and I would say those things really come in the size of fries. They were delicious. Wish they served more of those in the plate. Also you get complimentary bread to began with. Those were just okay. For our main course, we had CAROLINA MOUNTAIN TROUT and GRILLED MAHI MAHI. Both the entrees were well cooked and served timely. The taste was just so good. The ambiance was overall good. It would have been better however if we were not sitting right at the table by the bar section. The server later got us a variety of desert options to choose from. Key lime pie and Strawberry cheese cake were a couple. We decided to have the cheese cake and boy was that good.   I would definitely recommend a visit to the fish market. Make reservations in advance and keep in mind that this is a $$$ place."}
{"text":"Dinner here last night Everything was very good Service food drinks and prices well worth the value Very nice decor  Abby Our wItness was very good Will go back"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and have never been disappointed. The food is incredibly fresh and so darn good, just thinking about it makes my mouth water! The waiters make you feel taken care of, almost like your the only people in the restaurant I'd recommend this for a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Horrible service been here an hour and still no entree, and it's really not all that busy... Back when the food arrives 15 minutes later, our waiter, the one who has been not taking very good care of us brings my daughter in law, a piece of cheesecake , She said you haven't brought us our dinner yet, I just don't get this guy! Dumber than a rock .we will never try this place again, it was that bad"}
{"text":"We decided to have a birthday dinner here. We arrived at 5:00 p.m . , had a very friendly hostess and waiter .The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable.  The waiter explained about the daily specials and the menu in general . Bread came to the table with a dipping olive oil mustard concoction .Both were very delicious . 2 of us ordered the specials such as the sword fish and scallop dinner.  My dining mates ordered the fried fish and Cioppino. 2 of us ordered the she crab soup and the jumbo shrimp cocktail . One dining mate ordered the wedge salad . The fish and seafood all tasted very fresh and tender. The soup was delicious. My friend said she had better wedge salads, her salad lacked crisper lettuce and blue cheese crumbles. Also her Cioppino had more chewy calamari than she preferred. We ordered a birthday cake for the table, a pound cake with fruit and raspberry sauce which was very tasty. Coffee was very good. All in all a very enjoyable dinner. Food was plated nicely, came out hot, good portions, menu pricey. Menu  has limited choices for  poultry, pasta and steak if one does not care for fish or seafood. The restaurant was quite crowded when we finished our dinner. We would certainly return. Wished I could rate 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Food: We had the grouper with bits of crab and a light, cream sauce. It had an updated Southern feel and was beautiful to look and a tasty indeed.  I could see other happy tables with salads, chicken, and other seafood choices. Oh, we also had an amazing She Crab Soup, luxurious with bits of crab and an artful drizzle of cream on top.  Decor: Calm, cool, and comfortably upscale. Beautiful art, comfortable tables, and water elements.  This place is nice enough prom dates and wedding receptions, but is a comfortable enough for local families and groups to come and enjoy.  Service: Knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Good recommendations for menu choices. Not overly attentive.  Easily the nicest restaurant in Fort Mill.  This is the place to take your date, your business colleague, and your best friends."}
{"text":"My first experience at the Fish Market was nothing I couldn't quickly forget but given it's one of the only decent restaurants in baxter village and it is convenient to my office, I end of making reservations here more than I would like to. The staff is friendly and the atmostphere is decent. I peronally had the shrimp and grits and loved it but I can't say the same for the other meals I have had. Again, great for client meetings if you are in the area, but I would rather go farther into Charlotte if I can help it and especially so for non-work related dinners."}
{"text":"Started with Calamari Fries and She-Crab soup. Both really good. Several different entrees: Filet Mignon, Shrimp & Scallop Pasta, Chicken Pasta. Both pastas were full of flavor and good size portions. Filet looked great and tasted wonderful. Would recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"The fish market... not bad, A little overrated from the reviews I read.  Jason, our waiter, was GREAT, and I like the jazz being piped through.  The ambiance is ok, but my wife warned me not to use the restroom since it was filthy. I live close enough that I will wait to take a piss when I get home.  I don't want to trash this place because we did enjoy our meal, but the chef could kick up the spices a little.  We came here tonight because we didn't want to deal with Charlotte traffic to go to Brio, and this seemed convenient, but we regret that decision.  By all means, give this place a shot and support local businesses. Make sure you ask for Jason as your waiter. Price is reasonable, and desserts are great. That's my two cents."}
{"text":"We came to Fish Market for my birthday with my parents. None of us had ever been. Our server was great. Seemed to stumble over the specials a bit but otherwise she was attentive and supplied us with everything we needed and/or asked for. Our appetizers were delicious as was everyone's entrees. No complaints on the food! Only thing I would recommend is to do something for people's birthday's when you know they are dining out to celebrate. Even though people say they don't like the attention, it's always nice to feel a little special and get some dessert on your birthday! Will return for the food."}
{"text":"My first visit landed me a three day stay in bed.  I went out for a pleasant dinner ordered the \"Queen's Feast Week\" scallop dish.  The food was very tasty.  Then I ordered the Key Lime pie and it went down hill from there.  Mild case of food poisoning.  Sick for a couple of days. Ugh! It's possible it was mishandled in kitchen. I can't say I would return."}
{"text":"We love going here for their Sunday brunch. Food is pretty good and the service is always reliable."}
{"text":"Really great local Baxter business.  The Fish Market always has consistently good service, good food and a nice ambience.  I really enjoy eating outside there on a nice evening.  When we bring our children, the staff is great.  It is a great fail safe place to go out and have a nice meal."}
{"text":"I have been to the Fish Market a few times for dinner but have not been for lunch much.  I went today to meet a friend for lunch.  The restaurant was mildly crowded and we were seated immediately.  I ordered the blackened grouper sandwich with bean salad and an unsweet tea.  My friend ordered the Scampi special.  My food was OK, a basic blackened grouper sandwich which was a bit too small for the size of bun that they put it on resulting in the sandwich being too \"Bready\".  Bun coverage is big for a sandwich like this.  The grouper itself was good.  The bean salad was a bit bland and needed some vinegar to jazz it up....it was pretty much a 5 bean salad with just beans and nothing to add that little pizazz to make it great,  The service was spotty.  Server came right away to take our drink order and asked us if we needed a few minutes to look over the menu which we did.  She returned in about 10 minutes which is too long IMO especially during lunch.  For Fort Mill, this place is good, I don't think it would make it in Charlotte.  I have had their sushi during the dinner service and don't know why they don't serve it during lunch....I think they're missing the boat on this."}
{"text":"Been here for brunch a few times and have always had a good experience. The food is varied, fresh and well prepared. She crab Soup is a staple on the brunch buffett, along with salads with fun dressings (peach champagne, strawberry basalmic, etc). With a medely of seafood, chicken, salad/soup and breakfast foods, the buffet is always replenished frequently.  The decor is plantation style but darker on the inside, but my favorite dining spot is outside at one of the tables on the veranda! The landscaping is beautiful and there's always a cool breeze that seems to flow through there. Perfect space for a romantic Sunday afternoon! ;)"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was bland at best. Ordered blackened Ahi tuna extra crab cake and wasabi potato cakes. All were mediocre nothing stood out other than the wait staff who took their job serious and were very attentive."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Great service.   A few gripes... Special was cold. Chopped salad was bland. Tuna tataki was just ok.   The good: Chilean Sea Bass is unreal. Scallops were fabulous.   Nothing life changing... Would go back for the Sea Bass."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was very nice! this was our first visit and i must admit I choose this place only because i have a addiction to She Crab Soup and being so far away from my home towns near Charleston SC i really wanted some.  the buffet on Sunday gave us a chance to taste the food in small amounts which is what I prefer when hitting up a totally new place. I stayed on the lunch side of the buffet, my husband ate mostly breakfast items.  the she crab soup was very good, not the best I've ever had but it hit the spot. I did have to ask for extra sherry, it lacked that.  they had prime rib on the carving station (which is in the kitchen so you have to ask the server for it) It was GREAT!!!! they make it rare so you will need to have it cooked more if that is what you like. The aujus served with it was not broth like! It was thicker and stuck to the meat which was warm and very tender like all prime rib SHOULD be! i cut it with a butter knife!  I ate a bite or too of the fish, which was nice flavored but cold unfortunately. The shrimp and grits was for me blah! small seemingly previously frozen shrimp in course grits. The mac and cheese pasta was also blah, lacked cheese flavor and was again cold. The mixed salad on the bar was nice and there were several dressing choices. The desserts are a nice variety and small enough portions that you can get several! We will go back! but this time i know what to order!"}
{"text":"This seafood restaurant was absolutely amazing! The restaurant and location were beautiful, and every thing we ordered was delicious!!! The gumbo and she crab soups were so good, we wished we had more!!! Then we had shrimp, mahi mahi, fish fingers, popcorn shrimp, and the French dip! A little of everything, and everything was gone!! Even my kids ate some of everything! We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful views and had a great time! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I'd rate the food and service below average. Certainly not what you would expect at this price point.   Dirty and stained paper menus, server slow to clear plates as the meal progressed and just a general lack of attention matched the cold scallops and veggies that I ordered for my entree. The four scallops were also VERY small considering the $27 price. The $9.00 beet salad was also a huge disappointment. It was just a few beets with a bit of arugula and two very small pieces of blue cheese. It was heavily overdressed as well.   Underwhelming and overpriced.   With that said, it's a nice venue and can be better with just a few tweaks to food quality and service."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch, the decor is nice, servers were attentive.  I got a my fish broiled and it was a bit soggy, but tasted alright.  Want to give this place another try as this time wasn't spectacular, but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"We were a large party of 12 with reservations and got seated in the back room.  We ordered a large range of appetizers and main dishes.  Everything was good, but not great.  Meals took forever to come out of the kitchen and some were luke warm.  Clearly they were waiting for everything to come out at one time.  Expected better for the price."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the Fish Market. Everything I have tried here has been impressive.   The first time we went here we came for a celebration dinner. Unfortunately we did not realize the popularity of the restaurant and had to wait at the bar for a bit before we could get a table. Service at the bar was a little difficult to get but we were able to finally flag down the bartender to try their scallop appetizer. The appetizer just has two scallops but they are a decent size and were cooked absolutely perfectly. When the dinner came we were impressed with how friendly and prompt the waitress was. I ordered the filet Oscar style which came cooked exactly as ordered and was delicious.   We had such a good experience with dinner that we went back for brunch, despite the fact that they don't open until 10:30 for brunch. Every year I get older I find it becomes increasingly difficult to wait to have such a late breakfast but Fish Market brunch was an experience worth waiting for.  The brunch is less than $14 for an all you can eat buffet. The buffet is more upscale than many of the other all you can eat options. The brunch includes an omelette station, French toast, salmon and shrimp and grits to name just a few of the items. I had to try a little bit of everything and my favorites were the shrimp and grits and the thin sliced but perfectly cooked bacon. We finished our brunch with a sampling of the decadent desserts scattered throughout the restaurant. The key lime pie is a must try!  I would highly recommend the Fish Market with the caution that reservations are a good idea if you want to eat during a popular time."}
{"text":"Had a large party here for brunch buffet. The service was exceptional for the large amount of people we had. The buffet, did not impress me. the food was edible but nothing to brag about. There was shrimp and grits, soups, chicken and waffles, made to order omelets, mash potatoes, bread and cheese cake, chocolate cake and others. If in fort mill, try it. But I wont go out my way to come back."}
{"text":"This needs an update!! I came here for a lunch meeting and had a very pleasant experience. Our server was attentive and friendly. We got our food in no time. I ordered the fish tacos and they are definitely worth $8.99. It came with two tacos and a side of chips and guac. It was the perfect lunch. Not too heavy. My friend got the shrimp wrap and she ate the whole thing! The lunch was relaxing, not too loud. I would recommend coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great place, nice atmosphere and the sea bass is one of the best fish dishes I ate in a long time. Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Decided on the Sunday brunch yesterday. Good as always but the same items on the buffet with the exception of one or two items. Service was good, they take away the dirty plates not long after your done."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the week for the first time. Very nice decor/setting.   Ordered the market green salad and it was quite excellent. My companion got the Cesar salad and enjoyed it, as well.   I got the she crab soup and it was pretty good, but oh-so-rich. I also had a few bites from my friends plate, and it was very good! The shrimp was cooked perfectly.   Our waitress was attentive and pleasant during our visit. Food didn't take long to arrive and we were in and out in a jiff. Price was reasonable for the two of us.   Definitely want to come back here and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"What a disappointing and expensive evening!!!  Do you remember the Highlights magazine comic Goofus and Gallant.  Goofus would go out of his way to be rude, unkind or unhelpful. His brother Gallant was the opposite.  The service was almost all Goofus.  We took two of our (grade school aged) kids put to dinner to celebrate their good grades. We picked the fish market because my husband and I had dined there in the past and the food and service were always wonderful. It seemed like a special treat! It turned out to be anything but.  We were seated by a large party.   The service was unbelievably slow. (Over 2 hours) The server explained that they were down a man In the kitchens. The server was nice enough but clearly unsupported.   The party next to us continued to get loud and unruly.  At no point did a manager reach out to us to apologize for the slow service or offer to move us away from the loud group.  As we left, I spoke with an assistant manager who told me there was nothing they could do about the loud group. He suggested that \"if you give us another chance\" we request a quiet table.  What a disappointing dinner!!"}
{"text":"Lunch was very good and excellent presentation but wait time was really long. Glad I am on vacation :)"}
{"text":"Dinner is 5 stars, brunch is 4...still good, but not outstanding, like the dinner is at the Fish Market. Awesome food, great service and atmosphere. We go all the time!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot for lunch or dinner in Baxter Village. The Market Salad is very flavorful. My husband enjoyed the fried cod because the fish was not overwhelmed by the batter."}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday Brunch. It was a disappointment. I had such high expectations based on the reviews for the dinners they serve in the evenings. Sadly, we cannot say this has translated well into Sunday brunch cuisine or service.  For starters, do not make the mistake thinking this will be a seafood enriched brunch. It was not. They had some Salmon, Shrimp and Grits, and She Crab Soup. And that was all the seafood to be found. The rest of the brunch was standard breakfast food and none of it was the least bit impressive. In fact I was disappointed the grits were sub-par. And I love my grits.    And lastly, there  was a little bit of misinformation in the advertising of this brunch as it supposed to have a prime rib carving station. THAT is a gross over statement. One, you do not get to go to the station, you need to request this from the waiter. Which means you better know of its existence because no one is volunteering that information. Second, you are NOT getting a nice slice of meat. The serving is brought to you on a tea cup saucer! and its portion is maybe half of the saucer! and good luck getting a nice cut of meat. We didnt. we got chewy. I feel they should remove the mention of prime rib from the advertisement and its barely what you know as a prime rib carving station,  We gave it three stars because for the price, it was OK food. A regular brunch selection for the most part and none of the food was terrible. Hence \"3 stars, eh, OK\""}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner last night on Fish Market's picturesque outdoor patio with a great view of the fountain and beautiful Baxter Village in general. The interior of Fish Market looks lovely as well, though I can really only speak to the quality of outdoor seating which was quite nice. I would have liked it better if the ceiling fans had been stronger, but otherwise we were very comfortable.   Waitstaff are attentive and friendly. Prices are on the high side, especially given that portions are on the small side. However, the food is good and we received close to what we expected given the Baxter Village setting; you're paying a premium to eat in Baxter Village.  Pork Belly was perfect, calamari & beet salad both good, sushi was a bit on the small side and unfortunately nothing special.  Baked oysters were good, despite a heavy handed hollandaise sauce.   Our 2.5 yr. old definitely got a kick out of the colorful lime drizzle on the tasty cheesecake (see photos!).  Fish Market has an interesting menu and I'd be open to returning to try some of their other options. All in all we had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I really like everything about this place. Food is good. Prices are fair. The Sunday and holiday buffets are very nice. The staff if a bit unappreciative. Otherwise it would be a 5-Star for me."}
{"text":"I am so torn. I want to give 4 stars for their food, but positively zero stars for their service.   My fiancé and another couple dined here last Saturday, yes, during Queen's Feast (restaurant week), which is why I was torn about writing this, but the service we received was just inexcusable. Yes, the seafood is fresh, and the portions are great, but what's that worth when you have poor service? We had a reservation at 8pm, and already it was clear that the hostess (who was also our server) was frazzled. She even spoke unkindly to the other server, who ultimately sat us, and was already apologizing. Then it took about 20 more minutes for our server to acknowledge us, and we ordered. Now we did not order off the restaurant week menu. Fast forward to 9pm, and we still do not have appetizers (shrimp cocktail and 2 salads). Proceed to 9:30, they finally arrive, from a different server. Still no sign of server 1 and now we have empty drinks. At this point, the restaurant is thinning out and there are empty tables all around us. We sat with empty appetizer plates until out dinners showed up at 10pm. Yes. We were sat at 8pm and did not get our dinners until 10pm. I think at this point, our server just gave up, as we had to ask a different server on the floor to get refills on our beer/wine.   Overall, to me, service outweighs the food, and I just cannot excuse the lack of service we recieved this evening. Restaurant week or not, this was poor. Ot would have been one thing if a manager came over and said we are slammed (even though at 10 the restaurant was about empty) or if our server would have said something, but instead we were ignored almost all evening long. Thank goodness for good company at least."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend from New York and had drinks and apps. Loved it!! We didn't have reservations and ate at the bar. Our bartender was great, very informative and accommodating. We ordered just appetizers which were tempura mushrooms, crispy and juicy, buffalo shrimp which were a good size, artichoke dip, sushi rolls, crispy tuna cakes. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Next time we go back for entrees!!"}
{"text":"It was good. Service was good and food was tasty.  My favorite dish was the calamari was amazing. It's prepared a little different than traditional calamari, but I loved it.  Also, the kids mac and cheese was really good. They don't have a lot of variety.  They pair your sides for you and you can switch it out, but at a charge and it was a big deal."}
{"text":"killer menu and bring extra dough... it's pricey"}
{"text":"been a couple times and good food. The salad with the pickled onions if really good. The last time we went was during Restaurant Week on a Wednesday. The tempura lobster was quite chewy and the dessert was terrible. The service was mediocre. Love the atmosphere of the cute building but probably won't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to some really good seafood. Well, still looking for it. We went with some friends and my wife and I started with the scallop app - just wasn't good. Not seasoned well.  We both got the tuna entree when I specified seared medium rare.  Both came medium well.  It was tough. We don't send food back for different reasons and we could still eat it. Just wasn't very good. Service was ok not great. But not bad either. We closed with the key lime pie and creme brûlée.. The deserts were just average..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wine and service.  We hit them on a Saturday night with a group of 18 and they didn't bat an eye"}
{"text":"Stumble across them when I was looking for brunch options in that area. $13.95 brunch buffet? With prime rib and shrimp & grits? What?! So for Valentine's Day, I decided to take my girl friend there for our 2nd annual V-Day date/birthday meal. I called ahead to confirm that it's still the same price (you know how places LOVE to hike the price on holidays) and made a reservation.  The place is smack in the middle of Baxter. Lovely looking white house, with parking behind the building as well as on street. By the time i arrived my friend already had a table right by the food stations (and we last minute added 2 more people).  Overall the food was plentiful. There was breakfast items (ex. omelet station, biscuit, gravy, grits, bacon, eggs, fried potato) and lunch items (fried chicken tenders, salad, salmon etc.) I have to say the \"shrimp & grits\" tasted good but lacking shrimps. The salmon was a bit overcooked, which is inevitably when served in a buffet. Prime rib (more like rib roast) was REALLY good, but we almost missed it because you have to ask the waiter to bring it from kitchen. Soup was good; butternut bisque was super creamy - I'm sure it's fat free - and gumbo wasn't an authentic gumbo but tasted good. Coffee was strong and good for $2. They even had a few small dessert items to choose from. The service was good, Big Mike took care of us. For the money I think it was a good value for brunch (hence 4-stars)."}
{"text":"Just meh.  I had fish tacos for lunch.  Service was excellent;  quick,  attentive but not intrusive.   But the food was very average.  Could be that it was trying to mix UK fish and chips fish with mexican/latin cuisine; and it just did not lead to a satisfying meal.  The meal came with chips and guacamole and the guacamole was at least a day old,and had the old flavor that guacamole gets..."}
{"text":"Went to the Fish Market for a work dinner.  They easily accommodated a large party, and took good care of us.  Even split the check 10 ways.  I had a wedge and the surf and turf.  Steak was cooked a little more than I wanted, but its steak so I ate it.  Everyone at our table was happy with their meal.  Several folks got she-crab soup and enjoyed it.  Lots of shrimp and grits orders.  Great atmosphere, staff, and quality of food was A+!"}
{"text":"Posh little village area jammed with eat/drink/shop options, yelp app scores once again! Just the smell of roses alone walking to the front door was wonderful.  She crab soup was rich and tasty. The caesar salad with anchovies was good. The grilled salmon I had added was OK, a little on the dry side. The service was good and the atmosphere was plantation regal. I was on a mission to green and merc up so I am curious as to what their go to menu item is. Do tell..."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass.  Looking forward to our next trip to try their sushi."}
{"text":"Pretty much our go to when in the Fort Mill area. Service is great, food is fantastic and not overpriced. The sea bass is delicious along with most everything else on the menu. Desserts are solid as well. Place never disappoints give it a whirl if you're in town."}
{"text":"We ordered the crab and spinach appetizer, was shocked when a 1/3 cup of dip showed up with an entire plate of multicolored tortilla chips for $10 - the flavor was amazing but let us have a decent amount PLEASE!  Then I ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta, and it arrived with 2 medium scallops, 4 medium shrimp, 3 artichoke quarters and an entire bowl of pasta - ridiculous for the price I'm sorry.  I've been here twice before and never felt like I was served unfairly until tonight.  I hope management reads this and corrects this inequity of food for the money."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant. One of my favorite places in Fort Mill. Elegant atmosphere. The food is tremendous. The shrimp and grits is fabulous."}
{"text":"We have dined here several times and have always enjoyed.  Their specials are always good"}
