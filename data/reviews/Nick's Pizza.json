{"text":"Consistently great new york style pizza that is reasonably priced.  The crust is thin and the edges are crisp.  The toppings are all great and after ordering there for 3 years we've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Maybe It was just tonight, or maybe it's like this all the time, not sure, but the only reason we tried this place was that it was rated 4 and a half stars.  Man were they wrong!

We ordered a large steak stromboli with extra cheese through Grub Hub.

Positives:  The food was delivered timely and hot.
Negatives:  The steak looked and tasted like steak-ums, the bottom crust was soggy, some of the top crust was raw and most of the filling had slid to one end leaving the other end a hollow shell."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good and I like their wings. Always get them plain with sauce on the side. Prices aren't so bad and delivery is pretty fast. Sandwiches are great too!"}
{"text":"Worst wings I've ever had, like Tyson brand or something. Very cheap over breaded and not fresh at all. On top of that our pizza was soggy for $25 I would have rather ordered dominos sadly..."}
{"text":"We've tried just about every pizza place in the area and this is by far our favorite. The pizza is delicious, their wings are great, and the hoagies are yummy too. The customer service we've received has also been awesome. We waited longer than normal for our delivery but didn't call or question it-just let it go.  Someone from the store actually called us to apologize and gave us a certificate for a free pizza for our wait. Give this place a try for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  Great hoagies.  Great pie.  Fair prices.  Cheap delivery.  I have had a LOT of pgh pizza over the years, and this is a solid non-chain joint.  The sandwiches are fantastic. Probably skip the wings or anything fried, to be honest though.  Cheesebread is fantastic.

It's WELL worth a try folks."}
{"text":"Nick's pizza is bomb. Easy 5 stars to the pizza itself, 4 stars overall.

 Whenever we really want pizza, this is the only place we order from. We moved to Castle Shannon a year or two ago, and we were kind of spoiled for choice in terms of delivery places. Nick's was the first pizza place we tried and we really never should have bothered with anywhere else after that. 

The breadsticks are delicious, the chicken fingers are good, the burgers are mediocre, the french fries are okay. Haven't tried the hoagies yet, though from other reviews, they look like they might be pretty good. But like I said, this is where we go for PIZZA. Delicious, NY style, thin crust pizza. Similar to Fiori's but not drowning in cheese (thank god) and with less sweet sauce. 

Delivery is usually fast, and my only real complaint is their hours are a little short on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times. I've heard friends say it was ok. I decided to give it a chance. It was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. 

First of all, the pie had almost no real flavor. The dough, sauce, cheese...even the pepperoni was bland. I put some hot sauce on it strictly to add flavor.

On top of it, I got so sick. Who knew a small pizza could cause so much internal chaos. My stomach was in knots for hours. It gave me terrible gas, but then the E. coli like symptoms had me doubling over. 

I have had better pizza at Little Caesars. In a competitive pizza city like this one, I will never try this place again. When you have Fiori's, Betos, Mineos, Slice on Broadway...there's no reason to subject yourself to this."}
{"text":"So, we ate here with 3 adults and 4 children.  We fed everyone with one \"large Wheel \" and some garlic bread.  Everyone was polite and professional. Good job5"}
{"text":"Sure wish we had tried Nick's sooner!! Truthfully what turned me off was the restaurant adjacent to them which had THE worst Chinese food I ever ate. Sorry Nick's, better late than never! Helpful staff via phone. Arrived inside and felt like I stepped back into the late 1980's with complete old green refrigerator- reminds you of being in your nana's kitchen! Got the thin crust large one topping (pepperoni) pizza and small salad to go. Really enjoyed both! Likely to be our go-to pizza order in the area, which we've been looking for!"}
{"text":"Established way back in 1979, Nick's has certainly been a permanent part of Mount Lebanon's dining landscape, and is likely the preferred purveyor of pizza for area residents. An appropriate analogy would be Brookline's Fiori's or Dormont's Campiti's. 

Recently, Kay and I decided to sit down and try Nick's pie for ourselves after traveling past it a dozen times while running errands. 

An oddity among its competitors, a Nick's crust is somewhat thin like you'd find in a Big Apple sidewalk special. A crisp exterior hides a somewhat plush interior. A fruity sauce, a freshly-grated mozzarella/provolone (?) blend, fatty bacon bits, and savory black olives finished off what was a tidy, tasty platter of goodness.

The Meatball hoagie fell a tad short with its somewhat dry meatballs, the fine sauce and cheese salvaging the sandwich. 

The white-walled interiors are as sparse as the seating, but don't allow that to keep you away. Nick's is quietly serving up some quality pizzas in a modest storefont in a sleepy suburb. It's time the secret fell out of the attic."}
