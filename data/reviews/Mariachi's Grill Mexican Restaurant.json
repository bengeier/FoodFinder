{"text":"2 small flies in my first water. Sent it back. 1 small fly in my second water. Didn't find one in 3rd water. Staff didn't seem to care. People after us killed a roach on the way in. If I was from here I would call the health dept.  Food was okay, but who knows what critters I was swallowed while eating"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food at reasonable prices.  I recommend the tacos de asada and the poblanos.  Also, their Tequila selection is HUGE.  Easily the biggest selection I've seen in the Akron area.  You have to drink at least four shots anywhere else to mess up your vision enough that their selection looks even half as big.   Try a shot of Cuervo *Reposado*.  Service can be a little hit or miss.  They have several waiters that a really sharp guys and will take very care of your party.  On the other hand they have some servers that are not nearly as good.  This can be worked around if you go a few times so that you can learn who you want waiting on you, and then stick to them."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, moderately priced.  This place has the best tasting most consistent salsa of all the Mexican style restaurants around."}
{"text":"Been going there for years.  Love the food.  Always service with a smile.  Love the location, close to my job and home.  Never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been regulars at the Northfield Mariacchi Coco's before they went out of business for many years. Since their departure we have tried several other Mexican restaurants. They were good, but none had the large portions and flavor that we loved.  One Friday night while scanning the new Yelp app I had downloaded and I found this place.  We could not believe it until we walked in. Same great atmosphere and the same yummy dishes. We ended up eating here twice in the same weekend it was so good. The best part is that it's only 15 minutes away. :)"}
{"text":"Tragically went downhill after the previous owners and crew left. Although this restaurant was easily the best Mexican in the area, now every dish is watery, bland, and unrecognizable. Even the salsa is inedible.   The new staff are friendly, but unfortunately, we'll never return."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this thoroughly; it's great stick -to-your-ribs Mexican food.  It's been a few months since we last ate here, but we need to go back.   The kids loved the food too and sometimes that says it all.   So-so atmosphere but well priced and convenient."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. Since new management took over the restaurant has taken a serious nosedive. We thought we would give it another shot. The rice was cold, the server never offered refills and kept forgetting to bring out food. We only had 4 people in our group. You need to also watch your bill. He charged wrong prices for food, charged for food he never brought out and acted like I was an idiot for pointing it out!  The food was really bad. I had the fajitas. Bad meat and way over cooked. Served with a side of brown lettuce.   My children ordered off the kids menu. Most places add the kids drinks in. It was 5 for a single taco with a side of rice plus another 3 for a soda. A bit expensive for Mexican food... Bad Mexican.   If you are in the area.. Go anywhere else!!!  If you do feel the need to come here.. Take note if the prices so they don't rip you off!"}
{"text":"so far this is the best Mexican food close to home. Having grown up in a Mexican household, lived in Mexico and waking up to my grandmother making fresh flour tortillas every morning.....you could say that I'm close to impossible to please when if comes to restaurant Mexican food. there are several things I like at this place and several that I don't like. They don't make fresh tortillas. Both corn and flour tortillas are American store bought tortillas. American tortillas have a sweet funny taste to them. They don't use Mexican melting cheese and they put too much sauce on their tamales and sometimes it makes them too mushy. I do like their asada tacos, the tamales on a good day are very good. I love their refried beans and rice, The enchiladas are good. The beans and rice are just like my family in Mexico makes them. The chips and salsa are great!! The price vs portion size is right on and reasonable. This is the most authentic Mexican food in my area."}
{"text":"Was my favorite mexican restaurant but drove by yesterday to find it was closed down, no sign indicating it moved . Read somewhere online that the owners were indicted for back wages?  So sad that this place is gone."}
{"text":"On my quest to find good Mexican food in the area, I took my family here for a birthday dinner when they were in town visiting.  My family lives in an area with a 50% Mexican population, so they are pretty quick to say if they like it or not.  First, we were impressed by the servers and staff.  Menu was large, had mole and service was fast.  I ordered a mole dish and it was disgusting.  My family stated their meals were ok (not good).    Fast forward to the next morning.  None of us slept because we all had belly aches all night.  Then we all had to fight for the bathroom.  No thanks."}
{"text":"We were in the area and really wanted Mexican, this place got 4 stars so it seemed like a good choice. The chips and salsa and queso dip were good. However I had only had one bite of my meal when I came across a hair, I cut into my burrito and there was another one. I sent it back. They were very apologetic about it and took my burrito off the bill and offered a gift card for next time, which I declined since 1) I don't live in the area and 2) after that I don't think I'll be back even though the food was good.   Ill give them credit, everyone else's meals turned out great. Just not a fan of hair in my burrito....."}
{"text":"This used to be named Mariachi Loco and used to be one of our favorite Mexican eateries. The previous owners must have sold it as everything has changed. Our drink order was incorrect; the guacamole salad had sour cream and not guac; the salsa tasted like it came from a jar. The level of cleanliness has really declined. Mariaci Loco, where have you gone?"}
{"text":"Mariachi's is a nice place - I think it's a local joint.  I ordered the mixed fajita (beef and chicken) and it came with onions, green and red bell pepper, mushrooms, and broccoli - yes, mushroom and broccoli.  That didn't take away from the dish.  The portion was huge - it could almost feed two people.    If you're in the neighborhood, stop in Mariachi's!"}
{"text":"This can't be the same place! It was decent before but now it is horrible. Salsa tastes like it was from a jar with a little cilantro. The chimichanga was really an enchilada with boiled, bargain-basement chicken. Absolutely nothing in it- no spices, seasoning or ingredients. I almost gacked when I tasted the white cheese. I have never walked out of a restaurant before."}
{"text":"Got a golden margarita, it was ok. Service not the best, but whatever. Guacamole was fine, as were chips and salsa.   I asked the server what the best thing was on the menu. Although I am not a native Spanish speaker, I am a Spanish teacher and have lived and traveled abroad extensively throughout central and South America. I trusted that he, a native spanish speaker, would recommend to me the most authentic meal at the restaurant.   To my surprise, he said that the chimichanga and the quesadillas were the best thing on the menu. That says a lot...if a quesadilla (not mexican food) is the BEST thing at a mexican restaurant...chances are the food isn't very good...  I should've ordered that quesadilla. I ended up ordering chicken with mole. Mole had no flavor, no spice (not like the rich, spicy and cinnamony flavors that I am used to). I probably had four bites of the chicken and was finished. My friend ordered flautas. They are fried, so there is nothing you can really mess up. She said they were okay.   Oh well!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm speechless.  I stopped in for lunch for a basic meal (grilled chicken/cheese quesadilla and an enchilada).  It was inedible.  The chicken was rubbery and disgusting, the cheese was more like mayo, and the enchilada was burnt and just flat out disgusting.  Even the Pepsi tasted like soap.  Really!  How do you mess up Pepsi?  I guess the star is for the chips that I got to eat for free.  They waived my bill-- probably because they served it knowing it was gross..."}
{"text":"My wife and I split a Texas Fajita and a pitcher of Margarita (gold).  Both were delicious.  We went there Saturday at 7 and there was no waiting to get a table."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business and have to admit that I was a little scared after reading the reviews. Unfortunately I didn't have much of a choice without a car. I was pleasantly surprised with the Food and service. Especially for a small town. I will defiantly come back. The draft beers a huge. Defiantly a plus. :)"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place, we usually went there once a week.  New management took over a year or so ago,  and it declined quickly.  The salsa and queso are still delicious,  but that's it.  The margaritas are terrible now and the food is nowhere near as good as it used to be. The service is bad as well.  All the good servers who took care of us left because of the new management.  We haven't dined there in over six months. It's too bad, because it's so close to home."}
