{"text":"A Pizza Plus is delightful little hole in the wall that too many people pass by. Don't judge them based on their small storefront or simple two chair waiting area, all their care and attention goes into their pizza and that's what really matters.

Their pizza is reasonably priced by Greek pizza standards, and when you consider that all pizzas are 2 for 1 they're an absolute steal. Their crust is thick, soft and chewy, with just enough crispness on the bottom for support. Their toppings taste like quality and they're generous with them, if you order a house special you get every topping on every slice, these guys are pros. The cheese is abundant and strings nicely, and is always perfectly browned on top. But the real secret that pushes them above the rest is their sauce. The sauce on these pizzas is tangy and loaded with flavour, generous enough that you notice it, but not too much no fear of sogginess.

If you find yourself in their area don't hesitate. Just order yourself 2 different but equally delicious pizzas and wonder why chain pizza places even exist when these guys are around.

(One Caveat: If you are a fan of day old cold pizza, their crust tends to get a little dense in the fridge overnight.)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, great value! Wish I had found this neighborhood gem sooner! Will definitely be ordering from here again soon."}
{"text":"The best Greek Style pizza in Calgary. Been ordering here for over 20 years and it's always amazing. Prices are under $30 for 2 medium pizzas with 3-5 toppings which can't be beat. Best to order and  pick up if you live close by as delivery can sometimes be over an hour during peak times."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Quality, well priced pizzas. No gimmicks.

Great (really, fantastic) pizza, superbly fast delivery and great service. You can't say much more about a pizza place. 

If you live nearby and want to order some well priced pizza for delivery, this is the place. It's not a dine-in sort of place, which is why I believe they offer a good price for the value.

My first order was salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, green olives and black olives. It arrived cooked to perfection, hot to touch and a divine balance of ingredients.

The delivery person was friendly, personable and well mannered.

I only docked a star because they could make better use of their retail location for a cozy dine-in facility. It's certainly good enough pizza to warrant a night out."}
{"text":"2nd best pizza in town, always a ton of toppings and cheese. Garlic bread here is also superb."}
{"text":"This pizza is awesome. It's Greek style so thick with abundant toppings. The cheese is always browned perfectly, the crust is always the perfect mix of crisp and chewy. The prices are reasonable. You always get 2 pizzas for the price of one so it's a great value. There is a small delivery fee, but it's worth it. The other local purveyors of Greek style pizza are Spiros and Sophies and while they are also excellent, A Pizza Plus beats them hands down when it comes to price. Service is always friendly too. Their best pizza is by far the vegetarian special....more toppings than you can count and a perfect combination of sweet, salty, and savoury in every bite."}
{"text":"Classic crusty cheese top pizza. Some of the best in Calgary! Great prices and a family operation, which I always like to support.  Definitely worth checking them out."}
{"text":"A hey! This is a Mario! Where does a plumber and his brother get a good old-style a pizza in this place?
People a old enough to rememba the pizza of a forty years agooo will a say that pizza from A Pizza Plus is like a how it a used to be! Where the pizza was a full of lots of quality good cheese, a slightly broiled and a full of toppings. Not these a silly flatbread a pizzas! I give this pizza a One-Up and a 10 extra lives!

(Note: realistically, I prefer flatbread pizzas, but my Mom & Dad don't order pizza from anywhere BUT Pizza Plus so this review is for them and those people who are looking for old-school style pizza)."}
{"text":"A Pizza Plus is one of THE BEST, if not the best pizza places in Calgary!  My only gripe about this place is they are not open on Sundays, other then that their pizza's are fantastic!  We have ordered from them for years and the pizzas have been ALL WAYS great!"}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza around and they have amazing prices when you consider it's - \"Buy one, get the second of equal size for free.\"

I don't know about your household, but even if it's just me and my hubby we'll order an entire pizza each since we like very different pizzas, and considering we only pay for one - why not?

Also, it's the only place I order from when we have a group of friends over, without breaking the bank. The 2 for 1 sure counts for a lot when you've got a fair sized group to feed like at the kids birthday party or a night when your hosting a game party. 

This is not a dine-in kinda venue. It is great to order a slice or for pick up/delivery. They have no formal seating. Delivery is cash or credit card, they don't yet to debit for delivery. But if you're in a rush to get your order tell them you'll pick it up and it normally cuts the time down significantly. 

I grew up in the neighborhood with my parents ordering from A pizza plus for our family and now I feed it to my family. It's the best deep dish pizza I've ever had delivered. We've tried other places either out of necessity (lately they've been closed Sundays) or desire to change it up and it's always been a flop comparatively. And while these may not be the most health/calorie conscious pizzas, the deep dish deliciousness is completely worth the 'day off' from any diet. 

*note* Not really the best option for anyone with food sensitivities like lactose or gluten intolerance."}
{"text":"How did I manage to grow up within close proximity to Bow Trail and never know this place existed? I had a hankering for traditional deep dish in SW Calgary and took the advice of fellow yelpers in deciding upon  A Pizza Plus.

Good pizza! The tops of these deep dish pizza pies are baked with cheesy goodness. Delicious! The salt & pepper wings were impressive as well. They looked like someone actually took the time to season & prepare them properly. Nice! 

The pizzas here are all 2 for 1 based upon the selections which makes this menu very reasonably priced. The delivery wait time took considerably longer than approximated by the guy on the phone, so for that reason I can't give an honest 4-star rating BUT I will order again and will recommend A Pizza Plus to others.

Worth a try, Yes!"}
{"text":"This is really a hidden gem. We got 2 specialty pizzas (10 inches) delivered for under $30. Pretty delicious pizza and you can't beat the price. Last time we ordered something similar from Spirits it cost almost $100!!! I'll definitely be ordering from A Pizza Plus again"}
{"text":"I've lived down the street from this place for two years and haven't given it a try until today.  Wish I would have tried it earlier as it was good pizza.  

We ordered 2 for 1, House Special and Meat Lovers.  It was a lot of food!  We were worried that medium pizza's we had wouldn't feed us, but each slice is nearly a meal!   The only unfortunate part of these types of deep dish pizzas is if you don't order it downside up, the crust gets soggy due to the amount of toppings and that was kind of the case for us.

It did take longer than anticipated to get my pick up order, close to an hour.  That being said, the place was incredibly busy when I got there so it's understandable.  Nevertheless, it was worth the wait.

Not the best pizza I've had in Calgary but it ranks up there.  I'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"Most pizza places in Calgary suck, all dough barely any toppings. These guys make real pizza, thank god I found this place"}
{"text":"Great pie, excellent value but be careful on Fridays and Saturdays. Last time I ordered pick up on a Saturday, a pre-teen girl took my order and told me to be there in 40 minutes. No problem there. I arrive on time to pick up my pies and find they're getting absolutely blown out of the water they're so busy. The very first thing they did was ensure they had my money and then asked me to wait, even though I offered to leave and come back (I live about a 90 sec walk away). They want me to stay because \"it won't be long.\" After this, I watched very VERY carefully. Turns out, they were so far behind that they hadn't even started my pizza at the time I arrived and paid. I stood there for just over an hour before getting out of there. Got home and the pies were totally F'ed up, topping wise.

Haven't been back now in months and it makes me sad because when they get it right they make a fine pizza. All they had to do was be honest with me and have me come back later and all would have been forgiven. Their BSing me and making me stand for that hour is unforgivable."}
{"text":"Had this pizza again.  Seriously the best!  George is fantastic and puts love and quality into each pie.  Keep it going George!"}
{"text":"After 1 and a half hours waiting for delivery we gave up. We called, they were rude, we cancelled. This used to be a good place. Never again."}
{"text":"Family owned, a good price and excellent pizza! So glad this place is in my neighbourhood. The pizza is done of the best deep dish you can get!"}
