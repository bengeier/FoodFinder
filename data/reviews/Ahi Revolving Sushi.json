{"text":"Soooo gross, just stay away. I don't care if you have a coupon. Forget the coupon, burn the coupon. Just save your money and your guts, and do not come here! The sushi is better at a gas station (and probably cheaper, as well). Plus, the service was slow, and the selection (while sounding interesting on the page) was pretty gross in actuality."}
{"text":"Run away! Get back in your car and drive as far and fast as possible! The only saving grace here is the friendly host and server. The fish is not fresh and it's Friday night -- the weekend should be when the fish is at its best. I ordered salmon nigiri and got smoked salmon. The eel might have been seared earlier in the day, but definitely not at the moment I ordered it. Salmon skin roll came to me as a hand roll. The lady making the sushi didn't speak English and if you can't speak it, there's a good chance you can't read it either. The albacore that I ordered was \"too frozen\" to serve. Really? Go elsewhere! I have no idea how this place is even in business."}
{"text":"I like the conveyor belt of sushi it's made fresh and you can pic the different types of sushi as it goes around the belt, awesome service as well."}
{"text":"The service and price are fine.  We are very disappointed with the food.  Fried rice is the best dish that we had.  Way too much batter on calamari.  Shrimp tempura was very fishy.   Most importantly, the sushi was not fresh, you can see it by the color of the fish.  I really would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The restaurant was super clean and the server was friendly. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken off the menu. It was terrible. The chicken definitely wasn't fresh. It almost had a rubbery texture to it. The best part of that dish was the steamed rice...and that's nearly impossible to mess up. I also ordered the Green Tea Icecream for dessert and it was good. Overall, I won't be eating at Ahi again. You can find much better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here the other day because of the $14 for $28 groupon.  Have been to many of the revolving sushi places and this one was set up like most of them (some tables connected to the revolving sushi bar as well as single chairs).  The one thing that was slightly different was there was a menu you could order from that had things not on the revolving sushi bar (teriyaki plates and udon noodle bowls).  Since it was cold out, we decided to order two bowls of udon (kitsume and shrimp tempura for $7).  They were both good size and had plenty of noodles, vegetables, and fish cakes.  That was pretty much the highlight of the meal.  At similar places we have been to, you usually get four pieces of sushi per plate but this place only gave you three.  They did a good job of describing what was in each roll but many of the rolls claimed to have \"snow crabmeat\".  I have rolled sushi for a living before using real snow crab and this stuff looks like the imitation \"krab\" that most other places serve.  I could be wrong (maybe its a really low quality snow crab?) but if it looks and quacks like a duck...  Service was also mediocre at best.  We asked our server what was in the kitsume udon and she didn't know (tofu, fish cake, and vegetables).  Then, as our pile of lids built up with edamame shells and trash, she didn't bother to clear it even after the lid tower fell down.  Luckily, another server came and cleaned up the table and finished serving us.  As we left, we walked right past the host and another server and neither said a word.  Needless to say, this was our first and last visit.  If I get the urge to go to a revolving sushi place, I'll go to Teharu in Chandler."}
{"text":"I'm not a big sushi freak but do like it from time to time. Have tried Blue Wasabi, Kona Grill, RA, etc... So I thought I would try this place. The revolving sushi is really cool and they do have happy hour. The snack pack pudding and canned fruit cup rolling by was a little weird but kind of funny. I guess my only complaint is the decor / vibe. It's kind of like a hospital emergency room lobby. Very plain and kind of bizarre. Other than that I enjoyed it and will definitely go back. Just wish it had more of a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok I used a Groupon and tried this place but totally not worth it.... We left HUNGRY after spending $40. Who leaves a restaurant hungry.  You know something's wrong if your doing that.  This is totally not like Genki's. Only 3 little skinny rolls are on a plate for spicy tuna for $2 and not spicy at all. I asked for tea thinking its green tea but I got a Lipton black tea bag. ( isn't this a Asian restaurant ) they should have green tea. So any way if you are a very lite eater or a child this place is perfect for you. The sushi guys don't interact with you at all even though we were sitting at the sushi bar ( if you can call it that )."}
{"text":"Well, I wanted to like this place because its really close to home... But it just isn't great. The sushi pieces are super small and only 3 per plate, so the cost adds up really quickly! We had a groupon and still ended up paying more than it was worth. The sushi was ok, nothing outstanding but I guess it was good quality. We will be going to Teharu in Tempe for a more fulfilling and reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"It was yummy!! I loved the variety even during a weekday lunch!  I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was the time of day or the establishment in general. We had two rolls off the conveyor and they seemed old and dried out. We ordered a few fresh ones thinking the quality might be a bit better. The salmon nigiri was okay. I wouldn't recommend the potstickers or the baked lobster roll.... or eating here in general. The wait staff was friendly though so my review isn't totally negative."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Ahi and met up with my sisters for lunch. I brought my kids along for the ride!  My first impression of the dining area was that it is super clean and bright! We were seated immediately kind of close to the entrance.  It was a really fun to see all the different rolls going by on the conveyor belt. The kids LOVED grabbing what they wanted, which turned out to be spring rolls and cream puffs.   I decided to try the gyoza first, and I have to admit it was cold, but I didn't expect food to stay magically hot while rotating throughout the dining room. For that same reason, I ordered my rainbow rolls to be made while I waited. I have to say they were worth the wait! The fish tasted fresh and it was cold.  The kids liked their food, I liked mine. It was better than I expected after reading the reviews here on Yelp.  If you want a place where you can grab a (small) quick, cheap bite along with dessert, then Ahi is a good place! It's basically fast food sushi. Be realistic!   If you want a restaurant experience, go to a restaurant. Pay a little more. Wait a little longer.  Ahi was perfect for a quick, and fun, lunch with the kids,"}
{"text":"Ok to start out the food was good. My wife and I wanted to try this place out and we found a coupon on Groupon. $30 for $60 worth of food and drinks with 4 or more people. It was our 3 children, my Wife and I. The service was BAD we waited 10min once we were seated to even have a server show up at the table and take our drink and food order. We then waited another 20min for the food to show up to the table for the kids chicken teriyaki and 5 drinks.  My wife and I did have a lot of the sushi from the sushi belt. Once we were done we had to wait an additional 20 min to get the bill. And for that I ended up going to the front desk and asking for our bill finally as we were tired of waiting for a server to show up to the table. During this whole experience we had 3 separate servers 2 females and 1 male. Plus they screwed up the order 3 times. Im not sure if they screwed it up or if they just keep bringing the wrong orders to our table. The manager on duty did not seam eager to correct anything or offer an apology for the service tonight 12-14-2013 @ 5:15pm- 6:45pm. WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS RESTURANT AGAIN. Im sorry but even with the groupon. The service was so bad its not worth another trip."}
{"text":"I rarely give places bad reviews. But this one I had to. The only good thing was how cheap the sushi is. But I couldn't get over that thought of \"how long has this been un refrigerated circling on this belt?\" We ordered soup and the waiter brought it out cold and said oh sorry I forgot to turn on the warmer this morning. I couldn't get out fast enough."}
{"text":"My family and I had the WORST service ever!! The young male server never gave us our silverware, napkins, or menu. After 20 minutes of waiting, I had to go and get them myself! He never came to check on our table or filled our drinks. He helped the table next to us, just because he was flirting with one of the girls but just walked right passed our way. He never even came to give us the check, after an hour of being there, I also had to go upfront and ask someone else for it. They have one server and he does absolutely nothing!!! I could see him going to the back and texting every few minutes. I'm usually an extremely patient person but this really ticked me off! It was just extremely unprofessional.. They just lost my business. The sushi was really good on a lighter note. And the lady's making the sushi where the only ones that were hard working."}
{"text":"Great place for on the go sushi or ready eat sushi, if you're not the sushi type the place has a variety of cook foods like udon noodles, fried rice, chicken skews and among other things.  The owner is awesome and very friendly. Servers are on point and very friendly too  This place is self serve but I always try to leave a tip for the servers too for the drinks and kitchen items they bring to the table.   The place is great for kids, families, and parties."}
{"text":"There is a great sushi place in Scottsdale with a similar theme, so we decided to give Ahi Revolving Sushi a try as it is so close to home.  We went on a Monday night and it was very slow.  The revolving sushi did not change for the entire time we were there.  We had concerns about the food being fresh as a lot of the sushi rice was falling apart and some of the fish had that not so fresh sheen. We ordered fried jalapeños off the menu and received them almost immediately and barely warm.  From past experience with a similar dishe at another restaurant, this item ordered from the menu is usually hot and fresh.  We ended up spending about $40 and didn't eat anything we would order again.   Would not recommend this restaurant.  The last thing you want to worry about is how fresh the raw fish is."}
{"text":"I Love these places. My advice is to go early in the day because you never know how long it has been on the conveyor belt and I don't know what there policy is for that but cheap sushi that's good and lots of different kinds to choose from is a good night for me."}
{"text":"Great quality of fish very similar to Teharu but most items are $1 to $1.50 more.  Been here twice its not very busy at all I wonder how much longer they will stay in business. Some of the desserts are overpriced for example the macaroons are $2.50 for two little cookies."}
{"text":"Dishes were really off and tasted overall pretty mediocre, in addition to waiting 20 minutes to get a check when empty as well missing two of our people in party to order (out of 3). Overall, just common hospitality is expected. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Will not be going back! Gross Miso soup, spring rolls were cold, Vegas rolls were cold and gross. The peach sake was good but not worth it. Teharu is where we will stay from here on out!"}
{"text":"We do not recommend this place.  While the look is fine, there are several problems that made it unpleasant.  The A.C. was not sufficient.  It was warm inside, and not because of overcrowding.  There was no seating for waiting patrons, except for the concrete benches outside, in the sun, in 100 deg.+ temps.  After 15-20 minutes we were seated and there was very little on the belt (6 ft -10 ft empty spaces) except for desserts.  Unlike other places like this we've been to, the bulk of the dishes were on blue ($2.00) plates and the portions were small.  The variety was limited and by the time anything got to us, it was gone.  We ordered a special dish and it took forever to arrive.  The service was bad, bad, bad.  We had to ask the waiter for wasabi!  It will be a LONG time before we try this place again, if at all."}
{"text":"Awesome and relatively cheap Kaiten Sushi restaurant. Much better than their competition in all aspects: food, service, cleanliness, decor. The plates have dome covers to keep them fresher."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant shortly before they opened and made a mental note to drop by since I've had conveyor belt sushi in the past and it's kinda fun.  This morning I decided that today was the day so I fired up Yelp to check the current reviews on the place (just to make sure it wasn't a must-avoid kind of place) and then headed on over.  Their parking lot (shared with restaurants to either side) was pretty empty, but once I got inside there were around 20 people eating there - this was at noon on Memorial Day, so I don't know if that's a typical crowd.  There was plenty of room for more people.  I told the hostess it was my first time there so she explained how things worked there - pick what you want as it passes by, the plates are color coded by price and there is a price list at every seat.  There was also a menu for ordering specific items (like regular sushi places.) My Thoughts: The place is clean The staff is friendly and reasonably fast The portions are a little on the small side, but considering the price per plate ranged from $1 to $3 (with most items falling in the $2 range) it worked out to be pretty reasonable as sushi goes.  I left comfortably full and only spent 2/3 of what I would have at most other sushi places. The Salmon Nigiri was good. The cooks were busy the entire time and there was a steady supply of fresh sushi when I was there. Since one of the other reviewers had mentioned the lighting was excessive, I looked while I was there.  Maybe they read their yelp reviews, because although there were a lot of light fixtures, most of them were off and the lighting was fine - not too dark, not too bright.  The Final Word: I wouldn't say it was the most amazing sushi I've ever had, but it was perfectly decent and about 2/3 the cost of other sushi places.  They had a wide range of sushi available, friendly, efficient staff and a clean, welcoming restaurant.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Disgusting sushi. Tasted like it was left out for hours, the avocado was brown and warm on all the rolls. The fish tasted sour. Never returning nor recommending."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this revolving type sushi restaurant open up.  I love sushi and being from the Pacific Northwest, these type of sushi places are everywhere.  OMG...the worst sushi I have ever had...so sorry to have to say it.  It was warm...ick, when have you ever had warm sushi?   Service good.  Very clean.  I hope they get the sushi to a better quality and cold!  Would love to see them make it...but it doesn't look good."}
{"text":"They're under new ownership now, they have made some changes and not for the better. The sushi tastes not as fresh...the staff is still friendly but I feel this has become the McDonalds of sushi...you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My husband got food poisoning for the second time here. We thought maybe the first time was just a fluke. We will never. ever. be going back."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place right now! So yummy, I love the concept and their prices are great!!"}
{"text":"Rounding up, but I feel like it's really a 2.5. I came here with my family as a recommendation from my cousins, instead of going to my usual place for sushi, Shimogamo.   Pros: The decor is very contemporary, pretty to look at. It contributes to a good atmosphere. The place is VERY clean. The presentation of the food is amazing, they serve the plates on a conveyer belt that circulates around the restaurant. Each plate have two/three pieces of sushi served on a belt. For the price, the food is OK. It's about $2 a plate, the prices vary by the color of the plate. It's definitely affordable! Also if you check-in, (I did.) you get 10% off the bill.   The best dish I got was the Tempura Roll.  Cons: It's lacks quality. Very mediocre sushi, (but once again, for the price, it's alright). Besides the Tempura Roll and the Explosion Roll, I didn't really like anything else.   There's WAY too many rules. I originally came to get the all-you-can-eat $15.99 lunch, however, there was a too many rules associated with that. #1. 10% Off Facebook check-in does not apply.  #2. It's all you can eat, but you can't eat everything that's on the belt, there's only specific one's available, you have to pick them out from a list. You literally have to keep checking the small sign with the list to check if you can get the item or not.  Side Tip to the Restaurant: I think you should, at least, mark the items on the belt, so that they're easier to find. Not everyone wants to go on a word search everytime they find a plate they want. #3. You have to order a drink, so it's not really $15.99. It comes up to $18-$19/person + tax. Is that really worth it?  One of the servers were really nice, the other I feel I annoyed a bit with questions about the all-you-can-eat lunch.   Overall, good place for people who don't eat sushi a lot and aren't too picky about freshness and quality, but rather looking for something cheap, affordable, and quick. Oh, also as an incentive to get you to come back, they give you a coupon on the receipt for 15% off the next time you come in. (I'm guessing it doesn't apply to the all-you-can-eat either)."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for Friday date night hoping it would be good . I have eaten at a lot of sushi carousel places when I travel to Asia, but this was the first time in the States and for my wife. Upon entering i noticed how clean the place was which is always a plus for me. We were seated promptly and the service was average to a little above average, nothing special. Where I was not impressed was the plates. As the items came around, they just looked bland. After tasting the first plate, it tasted about the same as it looked, bland.  What I would recommend would be for this place to work on their sushi. Do something to make it more appealing. Maybe try some different gourmet type rolls on carousel. Use better ingredients... Maybe take the staff take a trip to one of the other local sushi restaurants that does sushi and rolls the right way so they have something to compare against.   I so wanted to like this place and I love sushi carousels, but cannot because the food just wasn't up to it."}
{"text":"We got a Groupon to this place and were disappointed.  The rice in many rolls seemed stale/slightly chewy/old, and the portions were very small.  The shrimp tempura did not have actual tempura batter, but standard American breading, and the dipping sauce had an unusual taste.  Servers took a very long time to bring drinks, even though the restaurant was not crowded, and orders we placed from the menu took extremely long to arrive.  The wait staff seemed inexperienced or desultory, and some of the rolls did not seem very expertly made.  I've had better sushi elsewhere, and won't be back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. They were open, it was nice and bright, and people were friendly.  Now the bad- the food sucked. Poor selection of sushi on the belt. Not great quality. Weird items (banana tempura wrapped in nori and rice).  Ordered an entree because was disappointed in sushi and it was just ok. Orange chicken was marginal. But better than the other items."}
{"text":"I really really hope this place makes it. I'm not sure if the area is going to respond to it. I personally loved it.   You need to realize your are going to a place with food on a conveyor belt. It hasn't been sitting for hours but chances are when you get there it may have been there for a short while. If you notices it's pretty empty on the belt, have a  seat and wait while they make more - then you get the freshest possible plate OR you can order with your waiter and they will have it made for you.Simple. It's not going to be the best of the best sushi but it's good, tasty food. Try the Salmon Nigi - SO DELICIOUS!   For the cheap prices per plate this place is great. We went in on a Saturday afternoon - it wasn't super busy and our waiter was quite nice. If I noticed something I wanted but it was  the last one I'd wait until more food was put out to grab one. We took a seat right in front of the chefs so it was easy to see what was being made. Plates range from $1 - 3.00 and with 2-3 bites per plate its perfect for groups/couples! Some items were hot, most cold and they even had 2-3 dessert options. I love having the options to try so many different things without committing to 8-10 pieces.   This is in our neighborhood so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason we went to here is the cheap plates. Having said that, the sushi was \"meh\"; not really good. The concept is pretty cool (becausethe sushi goes on a conveyor and you get to choose what you want; however, the bad thing is that you just don't know how long has it been sitting out.  The sushi comes on a color plate, which indicates how much the plate costs. The cheapest plate is $1 and the most expensive one is $3; which is not bad at all. So once you seat yourself anywhere, the waiter gets you the drinks and it comes with miso soup, which was super yummy and warm.   I had 3 blue plates and each was $2 so my bill for the sushi was $6.  Together Our grand total was about $26 dollars which isn't bad at all considering most sushi places, you would expect to pay about $40 to $50.   They also have a Korean menu. Since my fiancé doesn't like sushi I ordered him some bulgogi, tender beef.  That was better than the sushi.   Therefore, their services as greet but the sushi was okay. Nothing too fancy.  Next time, though, I would stick the Korean menu."}
{"text":"I think I'm being generous.....  The food was terrible: Edimame  was cold Sushi was not fresh, been sitting for long time, what should have been crunchy was soggy The salad..... more like soup The soup.... not even worth the dollar. The michi ice cream was disgusting and not worth the $2 The katsu chicken sauce was gross The only thing decent was the cream puffs   The wait staff: The girl was lazy Never brought us the things we asked for Took forever to check on us  Free refills on drinks, ha they never come back to refill Then our girl had some friend come in,  and had someone else cover us so she could wait on them.  2 adults, 1 kid, 1 toddler= $45 1 drink(tea) and  we shared.   Fun experience, but will never go back.   Ahi, you guys need serious help if you want to stay open.  Fun atmosphere but totally a dive. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Awesome way to sample everything and see what you like. It is very affordable and easy to try it all. Service was slow at first (and we had to ask for wasabi and flag someone down for more beer) but Mckinnley took over at the end and was awesome; very attentive, friendly and informative. We will definitely be coming back and bringing many more with us."}
{"text":"I visit Ahi weekly with my friends and it's the best!(: Great service and even better sushi! Everyone is so friendly and helpful! The sushi is at a cheap price but it tastes amazing! We love the desserts as well!(: 10/10 for sure(:"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised this was a decent Sushi place. Great for Teens and Tweens.  Didn't have anything fabulous nor terrible. Just middle of the road sushi. Thought the eel and explosion roll were noteworthy. May or may not comeback, but do recommend giving it a whirl."}
{"text":"Try the Long Beach roll. You'll thank me. This place, despite the run-down appearance, the sparse conveyor belt, and the skinny white college kid making the sushi, was actually great! Up until I ate the sushi, I was afraid I wasn't going to be happy. Prices were decent, and flavor is good. They've even got a volcano roll (like the one at sushi 101)  Want to go again and try more rolls!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I wasn't really expecting much when we came here. It's revolving sushi after all. But I found a Groupon and thought it would be a good opportunity to try out a new place.  Upon walking in the decor is just god awful. From the fiberoptic crystal chandeliers to the lime green walls and orange counters, tacky doesn't begin to describe the place. It was pretty busy too being a Friday night.  As can happen at these places, for the first 40 minutes all we saw was crap rolls. The good stuff didn't come by until we were pretty full which left us very disappointed. We showed up around 7 pm, so maybe we missed the initial dinner rush where all the good stuff was snatched up, but I wasn't really happy to see that the caterpillar rolls and tamago and what not all came out after we had asked for our check.  The rolls are TINY. If there was a Guinness Book of World Records entry for smallest commercial sushi rolls this place would surely win. You can also tell the people making the rolls are either very rushed, or very inexperienced. One of the shrimp roles I grabbed didn't even have shrimp in it. :( They are all very poorly put together with the meagerist of fillings. The larger rolls- on the purple plates- are far better, but you pay more for them. If they've been out for a while you are also greeted with room temperature sushi, which is disgusting.   Biggest complaint, however, was the level of service. We sat for five minutes before a waiter came by. We waited another 10-15 minutes before our drinks arrived. By the time they came, we were on the verge of full and didn't really want them any more. I know it is a large restaurant, but it's not like you are taking orders or serving food! You have very few jobs as a server in this place- to get drinks, to count plates, to get the check and sure, to give the one off menu item. There is absolutely NO excuse for poor service!   In short, we won't be returning. Masa Sushi up the street is ten times better."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, and it was a fun experience for my kids.  It was nice for them to try things without spending $10-$12 to find out they didn't like something."}
{"text":"This place is great to satisfy a quick sushi craving.  It seems like a lot of the reviews on here expect this place to have AAA, flown in daily quality sushi.  If that's your expectation then don't bother coming here.  But as someone who has sampled nearly every sushi restaurant in the north and east Valley, This place is as good as anyplace else that I know of for the price.    My daughter and I really enjoyed most of what we tried off of the conveyor belt.  The yellowtail, salmon and ahi nagiri were all fresh and delicious, And they had a great variety of rolls That were very nice.  The only real negative was the roll with banana and another with strawberries.  I didn't like either of those but in hindsight I probably shouldn't have grabbed those plates anyway.  All in all I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a fast sushi option at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"wasnt worth the drive .. never going back, horrible service meh food, lame selection and had NO ginger in house!! that was a deal breaker for me.... they ran completely out? we came early on the start of a holiday weekend.. oh boy better send someone to the store cause I mean come on! and trying to over compesate on the wasabi by giving me a 1/2 cup of it doesnt help...and i got a sob story from our server about the owners in return as if it was my fault for wanting some in the first place... The place was empty and our server couldnt even remember to bring our drinks correctly.. two waters and an iced tea.. really? then when it came time to pay he ran our credit card for the wrong amount.. really? we like this \"concept\" bc our daughter finds it entertaining.. so much for that. Wont be returning or recommending. Its a shame really bc its a great location ..  but everything else is wrong"}
{"text":"Gave it 2 stars, because the sushi looked good.  We wouldn't know if it is any good, becuase we left after sitting down for 10 minutes and not one employee acknowledged us, came by to say i will be with you shortly, nothing.  Upon entering we weren't even greeted by the girl at the counter.  After about a minute of standing there she just pointed to a table and told us we could sit there.  We were only spoken to as we left and one of the servers said \"goodbye. Thank you for coming in.\" She was oblivious to the fact that we hadn't been served.  I would understand if it were busy, but the place was maybe 25% full (if that).  It was disappointing, becuase i have wanted to try this place for so long, but i am not sure i am willing to go back in and try again."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in for Lunch. The sign said to wait to be seated so we waited. Someone finally told us to sit where ever so we found a seat. The place was dark and dirty. Again we waited. There wasn't any sushi going around the belt and so we waited to talk to the server. We sat there for 10 minutes without anyone approaching us about drinks or any orders. Finally we just got up and left. I was not impressed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food poisoning!!!!  Last night we went out to eat at this restaurant, after a busy day this is the only food I had! After a few hours of returning home I was horribly sick. The revolving sushi bars food temps aren't kept cold and hot food hot. After trying one warm California roll off the belt I told my husband let's order fresh. I am a fan of tempura rolls but I noticed when we received them they were cold BUT THE ONES ON THE BELT WERE STEAMING HOT. Which means they just kept switching the old sushi out to customers instead of fresh. Horrible, I plan on calling the health department.... Very dirty place too, we should of just left ."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 6.  Service was quick with drinks and checked on us regularly.  Between us we ate a wide variety of items and all were good, some were great.  It was a very enjoyable evening out.  We will definitely go back.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We weren't sure what we were going to get here. It looks a little unassuming from outside. However, the inside is cute and the conveyor belt is long and packed with yummy options. Everything we had was quite good. The price is reasonable and the service was good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Even after reading all the bad reviews on here; I went ahead and tried it out because my cousins wanted to try it. Lets just say these reviewers know what they're talking about. Being a pretty big sushi fan I have to agree 100% this place is just not very good. Lets start off with the sushi. First impressions, while waiting for my party to arrive, I scanned through all the different selections of what was available. Like all the other reviewers, these portions are incredibly small. Not only is the quantity per plate is small but also the sushi itself; it is half the size of a regular sushi roll. I was pretty disappointed of the quantity of plates just sitting on the conveyer belt with so little customers in the restaurant. I literally saw the same plate that no one wants go by the entire time my party was there. The flavor of each sushi was ok; some did not taste as fresh as others but that's to be expected of a revolving sushi. The nigiri had just a bit too much rice.  Next, lets talk about the service. Our waiter was good at best, he made sure our drinks were constantly refilled, and picked up our plate toppers in a timely fashion which is a plus. That is possibly the only thing good out of service; now to the bad, one of my cousin had asked for some paper napkins because she had spilled some of the soy sauce early on during our dinner. By the end we still did not see the napkins. Next, our table had a few orders of edamame and generally when bringing out edamame you are suppose to bring an extra bowl to discard the uneaten portion, but no we had to ask our waiter to bring us the extra bowls, and also little dishes to put soy sauce in to dip our sushi. This stuff is just common knowledge of a sushi restaurant; the customers should never have to ask for these things. Lastly, another cousin had ordered some fried calamari, but it took forever for it to come out; didn't see it come out till we were pretty much done with our dinner.  Congrats you've made it this far!! Thanks for hanging in there, but please keep reading just a bit more. Now to the decor; I have to say this is probably the only thing I liked about the place. Everything looked very clean and modern. Place was very well lit. Table choice however were a bit small, maybe this place isn't very well set up for larger parties. That seems to sum up my thoughts on this place; could probably keep going on but you all seem to get the point. Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Its okay, but just okay.  Prices are high for what you get, and service is spotty.  That being said, I do enjoy watching all the stuff coming around on the conveyer belt.  There's a fair variety to choose from, and there are actually things I'm willing to eat.  Portions are not uniform, though.  Sometimes the rolls have less than I like to see, and sometimes they aren't very well constructed.  Quality seems to be variable as well.  I know what to avoid, so its OK for me.  I wouldn't be so confident if I wasn't used to eating sushi.  My Chirashi bowl tonight was a bit skimpy for the $13, but they did take my preference for no mackerel into consideration when fixing it up.  Mackerel in any form is pukeworthy, I hate that shit.  I wouldn't feed it to my cat, I'm sure as hell not putting it in my mouth! The rice was pretty tasteless as well.  I'm used to better.  Maybe I'm a food snob, but I expect quality. Its okay, as I said.  A solid meh on all fronts."}
{"text":"The sushi is okay. Not the best. Sushi looks old. We went at 6:30. It doesn't look like many people come here.   The place looks nice and tidy..the food could use an upgrade though."}
{"text":"The only reason I would go here is because of their groupon. I've been here three times now, and I probably won't be going back. I found a hair on one of the plates I pulled off the belt, and the wait or I had didn't even really acknowledge that it was something to fuss over. They are pretty expensive for what you really get. I'd say my favorite revolving sushi bar is still Teharu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything, all you can eat was delicious and loved that we could grab off the belt. And shashimi, so great. STAFF Was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great sushi. It's hard to find good all you can eat sushi in Arizona and this is hands down the best. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night with my 15 y/o son as I had purchased a groupon.  I got there just after 4 pm when they opened, there were only about 4 other families there.  The sushi was good, not high end stuff, but it was good and I would go back again.  I thought it gave you a good opportunity to try something you may not otherwise try.  The plates run from $1 - $3 and you get 2 - 4 pieces per plate.  I think the only thing I really did not like is the stacking of the plates.  Each plate is a different color and each color represents a different price, so they keep all the plates on your table until you are done so they can total you out. My son wanted to try a bunch of new things so we stacked about 20 plates between the two of us.  The place is clean, contemporary looking, they had several different TVs although you could not hear any of them as they also have music playing.  I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"This location just opened within the last month.  The location is new and very clean.   We went there about 4:30.  They were running a special, all plates $2.00.   Was very concerned that there were many dishes on the belt and not many people in the restaurant.  Also concerned that they were not marking the time on the cards so you can determine how long the dish had been running around on the belt. There were some dishes that clearly did not look like they were fresh.  When avocado is turning brown, that might be an indication??  And when we asked the server why they were not marking the cards, his only response was, \"They are supposed to be.\"  We had a couple of plates that were questionable.  Ended up limiting ourselves to the dishes that came around that the chef just prepared or we saw were just set out.   Overall, this was not a very good sushi experience.  For someone that is experiencing sushi for the first time, this might be their last two.  I agree with one other reviewer..  There are other good conveyor belt type of places.  Don't be discouraged if this was your first experience.    Probably will not return. This place made a horrible impression...!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Nice staff, clean environment. I will be back! Lots of options. If you want something that you do not see coming around. All you have to do is submit the order to the waiter and they're more than happy to assist. Affordable sushi. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Came in at dinner time on a weeknight. The waitress was friendly but wasn't around at all despite the fact that the place had only one other party at the time of our arrival. She left us a Sharpie and a menu with no explanation whatsoever. We just started grabbing interesting-looking plates after 5-10 minutes of sitting there looking at a basically empty sushi bar hoping for something appetizing to roll by.  There was barely any sushi going around initially, but the chef was pretty awesome and made a bunch of fresh stuff despite the fact that my boyfriend & I were the only guests at the time. He was really friendly and made suggestions and it was super appreciated especially since the waitress didn't really give a shit lol. Like, I actually was a bitch and counted the 28 fucking minutes it took her to bring us our check after she stopped by and saw we were done eating. We had drinks still but, seriously?   They have great prices on Sake-Bombers and you can fill up for under 10$ honestly. Some of their rolls are really delicious and interesting, compared to Teharu's basic selection."}
{"text":"Have done lunch there twice now. We did the all you can eat option, so everything is made to order.   Did not do conveyor. We arrived about noon and she was filling the conveyor.   Rolls are fresh and good. No funny flavors as some sushi places.   Service has been good, but if in a hurry, you might not like it.  Not speedy."}
{"text":"New restaurant near the theater we frequent often. We decided to give the revolving sushi place a chance. We went there for dinner tonight and honestly will never go back. We were seated promptly and the service staff was good about getting us our beverages. I was not really bothered by the lights that other reviewers mentioned. The food was awful. The only item that tasted fresh was the salmon nigiri, maybe because my fiance kept getting it and they had to replace it on the belt. The squid salad was the worst I have had in my life. The seaweed salad was not much better. It was obvious that the food was not fresh. We had some rolls that were usually served warm, by the time it made its rounds around the place, it tasted funny. I recommend you skip this place, I would be surprised if they are still in business in 6 months."}
{"text":"A couple things from my Friday night Experience  1. Not much seating for waiting. 2 benches outside and 4 chairs on the inside. I only care because my out of town mother was with me.   2. The music was extremely loud.  3. I sat directly 2 feet across from this older gentlemen on the other side of the belt who just stared at me. Awkward....  4. I counted 12 minutes exactly before something other than cheesecake passed my way on the belt. I saw many signs for rolls but nothing behind them.  5. The pieces were cut super thin and there were only 3 to a plate which makes the price too high for my taste.  On the plus side, I tried some things I don't normally like (i.e. cream cheese in rolls) because I was super hungry and the options passing me by were coming  every 4 minutes (literally). I found out, yep, still don't like cream cheese in my rolls.   I recommend going to Teharu Sushi in South Tempe if you want something on the East side. It's not the greatest sushi either but you get four larger pieces on cheaper plates, the belts are full, and there's more indoor seating for waiting. It's also smaller so the wait is long but I think Ahi might be too big (it's huge!) to keep belts full."}
{"text":"The reviews of this place don't do it justice. The lighting is a problem? You expected better sushi? C'mon people this is sushi in Gilbert!! Go to Scottsdale and spend 3 times as much.  This place is great for a quick lunch or dinner. Clean, fresh sushi in a fun environment. Great value for the money. Do yourself a favor, have a meal here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Revolving sushi. You sit down,  pick your plates, and pay for your plates afterwards, right? My experience here was so comically frustrating and confusing, all we could do was laugh at the end because it WAS SO BAD. What a shame, because I had brought my parents to try out their first revolving sushi experience. For lunch on a weekday, we were greeted by the hostess who advised in order to participate in the sushi conveyor belt, we HAD to purchase an All - You - Can - Eat deal for $15 PLUS drink. Otherwise we would have to order sushi off the menu.  Well how disappointing to come in to eat off the conveyor belt, only to be told you're not allowed to without committing to at least ~$20/person. That defeats the whole point of revolving sushi, if you ask me! It's designed to be convenient and cheap. So we sat there, letting the food roll past us, taunting us, until we ordered our sushi the old fashioned way.   The waitress was in serious want of better training. After providing us with a paper menu listing sushi rolls and prices, we each ordered a roll. I also.got miso soup which tasted bland and was lukewarm. Oh, we also got edemame, which they first forgot and then grabbed hastily from the revolving belt and served to us soggy (why are we not allowed to grab off the belt again?) The rolls weren't great but weren't bad. I think they also came from the belt because they were served in smaller, clustered portions. (Why..?!)  When we got our check, the rolls were priced higher than the waitress advised us according to the menu she brought out. We spoke with the manager who said she brought us the to - go menu, so sorry but tough sh*t, we were stuck with the tab even though the fault was not with us. Even after we expressed our disappointment with the food, no concession or apology was offered.   For what was supposed to be an easy, cheap lunch, it turned out to be disaster. Never again. There are too many other good and competent sushi joints in the valley to waste time here."}
{"text":"I love sushi and was so excited to move by here. For being revolving I know not to expect the highest quality with the prices. That night I got food poisoning and talked to my friend the next day and even though we ate different things she had it too!  I'm so sad!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you like a fun n relaxed atmosphere. Great way to try sushi, fresh, inexpensive and fun to choose off the conveyor belt. I've had the menu entrees and they are great too! Service is great, very family friendly!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, and the prices were good. However the more simple rolls were lukewarm. The Vegas rolls were baked and not fried, probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This is way cheaper than going to an \"order your sushi\" place. $1-$3 plates. The food seems like it's been sitting around for quite a while. Which I suppose is expected....I don't know. The wait staff is extremely nice. I'm on the fence here. I want to like it but room temp sushi is kind of a turn off."}
{"text":"The sushi here was absolutely fantastic tonight!! Between three of us, we put away over 30 plates of ridiculously amazing sushi. The staff was very friendly, the beer selection was appropriately excellent for a sushi restaurant, and the only downside to our visit I can see was that there was only us and one other family there- I'm just *really* hoping this place doesn't go out of business. Will eat again, A+++!!"}
{"text":"For a revolving sushi place this spot is good. Lots of  selection good flavor. Kind of a fun experience grabbing what you want as it goes by. Price is ok for sushi but great place to eat fast and go if your in a rush or with kids (they enjoy the sushi go round as well)"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time using a Groupon.   It was totally dead at 530 on a Wed but picked up after 6.   Its really not bad. A lot of nice selections and everything we tried was good. The portions are smaller from 2-3 pieces but the plates start as cheap as $1.   Some cheesy deserts came by including those canned del monte little fruit in can snacks? Why would you spend a $1 to eat that here? I put those in my kids lunches."}
{"text":"The prices are very good and range from $1 to $3 a plate of sushi. If you like revolving sushi then it is cool to go to, but I would not recommend this place. The sushi on the belt tastes old and not as good. You can tell the sushi has been circling the restaurant for a long time. I have never been here when it is crowded, so there has always been open seats. If you order your sushi, they will make it fresh and it will definitely taste better. I would recommend their hand rolls if you do go."}
{"text":"I haven't been back here in a long time, but things have improved.  Maybe we were there on a surprisingly good day, but I noticed an improvement in service and the speed in which food came out. The sushi chef at the bar was definitely a new guy and he was fast and efficient, he didn't sit around and take his time like the old people did. Our server was a nice young blonde girl who had a good attitude and was very courteous, we didn't wait around for anything and got exactly what we wanted. Good job!  Keep this level of service up, it's working. Whoever you fired, whatever you did to make it better, Keep it up. Kudos."}
{"text":"This trendy spot is casual yet I can see the bar getting up and popping later in the evening. The service is friendly but our waitress left before we paid our bill so we had no one to put orders in with. Other than that, great experience and will return when visiting friends."}
{"text":"While it's not the best sushi I've eaten by any means, coming here means I can have a lot of variety with out all the leftovers.. Each plate has just 3 pieces of a roll on it, allowing you to mix and match.. Especially like the explosion roll and the  tempura roll.. Stay away from the desserts...ugh."}
{"text":"So the idea of revolving sounds awesome, and it is but when you've seen the same sushi revolve around for the two hours I was there kind of make  me think that I'm definitely going to get sick from raw sushi that hasn't been refrigerated in a while. The plates and covers used for the sushi looked like they had been just wiped down with a dirty towel and used for the next sushi roll. The mochi ice cream shell that is suppose to have a gummy consistency, crumbled and dissolved into a liquid in my mouth. Never going back."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of revolving sushi. However, it seems concerning when the fish looks like it's been there for quite some time. Overall, this place could use a face lift. The service was super slow but they're really nice. The variety is decent. The quality of food is ok for its price. Rice was a little soggy. Don't know if I'm gonna want to come back."}
{"text":"After coming back 3 more times and each time the quality of food had gone down I have to remove 2 stars."}
{"text":"Very new still but the quality in taste is definitely there and the prices are amazing. Only complaint is the wait staff can be awkward at times and not great at refilling drinks. I'm sure they are still working out all the kinks. :)"}
{"text":"A new family favorite, small plates that are expertly made and reasonably priced. We came here with a Groupon a few years back and it's nice to see that they have added the eel, soy and spicy mayo to all the tables."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I just returned from living in Japan for two years. I love sushi and have been trying to find something to fill the void present since Japan.   Sadly, this place did not fill that void. If you are looking for quality nigiri sushi (slices of fish on rice) or sashimi (fish slices without rice)  then you will be unfortunately disappointed. I was I would recommend RA sushi down the streetif you're looking for a first-time sushi experience or good quality sushi.  The atmosphere was nice and would be very fun for those that have not experienced Kaiten or revolving sushi."}
{"text":"We're done with this place. Been coming here for a few years and the sushi quality has always been fairly good for what you'd expect for conveyor belt sushi. We've started to notice less variety and S  L O  W service. The kids manning the floor are more interested in socializing with their friends than serving customers. We just witnessed a kid sit a couple down, take their drink order, then walk up to the front and play on his phone.  You guessed it, he forgot the drink order. This was the same kid that forgot our drinks as well, never checked on us, and only came over when it was check time.  The food is fine but less and less variety.  The service is horrible. You'd be better to go to Frys and bring home some sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi is good for a place in Arizona, atmosphere is a let down reminds me of a cafeteria, needs brighter music and a more welcoming color scheme remove that orange!"}
{"text":"When going to a revolving sushi place, one has to have certain expectations.  Revolving bars aren't a place to go for a fancy dinner/lunch.  These places are for a quick, fun meal.  This place definitely provided that.  It is a little bit more pricey than Teharu, but the sushi is better.  Ahi will be our go-to for revolving sushi from now on."}
{"text":"I do like this place and will go back, but it's not worth more than 3 stars.  PROs: They almost always have a deal on groupon and you can eat super cheap here. They  have a decent selection of sushi, including vegetarian items. You can also have them special order any of the menu items- I get mine with soy paper and it's NO upcharge. I LOVE the peanut avocado rolls. Not sure why other places don't have them.  CONs: They only have beer and wine- I wish they had a full bar. Also, the dessert items are kind of a joke. They seriously must have went to sam's club and bought pudding cup and fruit cup packs. I laughed when I saw those going around on the sushi belt. We did try the cream puffs (they looked awesome), but they were very disappointing.  Overall- they have good sushi at good prices, and that is what will bring me back. If I want to have a mixed drink in with my sushi with a few more menu options I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Many of the things that turned me away at first have been corrected.  The Sushi is fresh and tasty and the service is outstanding.  The ambiance is quiet and clean.  The fluorescent lights of death have been minimized.  Overall, I am very impressed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has only gotten 3 stars. This is my first time being at one of these places and I love it!! Had very friendly service from everyone we dealt with. We went with the all-you-can-eat option because it's cheaper on Sundays. Wouldn't have done it for the full price because we don't eat enough to make it worth it. This was a great choice and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! This is my wife an I second time back and it is just as awesome as the first time! We highly suggest coming here for great sushi if you're on this side of town. Great value and service is great!"}
{"text":"My niece wanted to try something \"new\" so I took my family to revolving sushi. It was they'r first experience with conveyor belt sushi. They loved it! Quality of food is ok (typical for places like this) but allowed them to try several different dishes. They became rather busy and ran out of many items. The server was friendly and kept our drinks filled. All In all a good night even tho the food itself isn't incredible."}
{"text":"Great sushi place in Gilbert. I tried most of their items and it tasted good. Staff is friendly and helpful. I would definitely come back with family and friend."}
{"text":"So I never understand how fresh this may be but most of the plates uses imitation crab. The eel does not look so great and they don't use a whole lot of it. Pricing is done by color of the plate. Ranges from $1-3 per plate which can add up super quick with only 4 pieces per plate."}
{"text":"This place has went under new management!!! I feel amazing here since I've been coming. The service is amazing and more.. if you have been here before and experienced lackluster food and service.. please come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are sushi lovers and have been to revolving sushi places before so we thought we would try this one out.   Price- The plates are color coded and the most common color is blue which is $2.00.  You get 3 very small pieces of room temperature sushi.   Quality- This is very low quality sushi. I'll clarify by saying that I'm not afraid I'm going to get sick, but I wish I would have just picked up some from the grocery store because at least the fish is cold.   Close Alternate Option: I would go to Orient Sudhi on McQueen and Elliot for $3.50 you get an entire roll prepared fresh.   The Positive: This place is EXTREMELY clean and I couldn't have asked for a better wait staff. Just wish their food matched their service. We won't be back. :-/"}
{"text":"First time ever going to a \"rotating\" sushi bar, and it was a neat experience for me and my boyfriend. The guys making the sushi were lively and fun, but our server was a little bit scattered. We weren't given a menu either and had to ask for one instead to figure out how things were priced (it's by plate color, white being the cheapest and then prices rising a little as yellow, blue, purple, and black). Has pretty much all of your typical classic and specialty rolls, and it all seemed pretty fresh. As far as the concept goes, really cool, but kind of weird if you consider that your food has been stared (or possibly touched, ah!) at by 20 other people probably a good 2-3+ times before you plucked it off the conveyor belt circling the restaurant."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. We saw it on Groupon and since it was close thought we would try it out. We LOVED the explosion roll, the new orleans roll and the coconut shrimp was like candy! We checked in on yelp and got the penny sake. Beer was super reasonably priced without any happy hour or anything.   Be careful because the $2 and $3 plates will add up, but sushi is often more expensive than other foods. The cream puffs looked Devine but were super dry. Staff was really friendly.  We recommend going after 6:30 on a weeknight as the more people that are there the fresher the rolls. Overall very pleasant and we will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"I normally go to Teharu but decided to give this place a try because of a Groupon and returned because I actually liked it. Be forewarned that the service is pretty poor. Both times our waiter took FOREVER to come and even greet us. Both times, it was not a busy day.   The sushi is pretty on point. Usually whenever a revolving place has squid, octopus, or any other fish it comes out pretty dry, this place I haven't gotten one dry item yet. The best thing I like about Teharu is that they have eel sauce on the side if a person is looking for something sweet. I'd recommend that this company get that and work on the staff and I'd give 5 stars. I'd continue to go here but I'm not fully converted from Teharu yet. Just like another reviewer said, be careful because those plates add up! We also tried the Katsu, it wasn't the greatest that I've ever had...but it wasn't poor either. I'd say stick with the sushi."}
{"text":"This place is so great! I went here today with my Boyfriend and we ate all we could and the bill was crazy cheap. The employees are super helpful and sweet and even the music that was playing was neat. I will def be coming back !"}
{"text":"Another Love hate relationship I have. We stopped in on a Friday night at 7pm, pretty empty for a Friday night in downtown Gilbert.......Hmmmm......will this be around much longer? With only 20 people in the place, how often are they making FRESH sushi back there? I'm only seeing one sushi chef........  PROs...........cheap, variety, small portions (so you can try many different rolls) and fun to watch food on a conveyor belt.  CONs.........the sushi is warm, squishy, and all my selections tasted the same.  There's really no way to tell how long that piece of fish has been at room temp.  PLUS++++.......I got my kids to try sushi for the first time and they liked it....ALOT, had loads of fun watching the rotation of food past our table."}
{"text":"I was super excited about a revolving bar opening up closer to my house, since Teharu is a ways away but I was kind of skeptical about trying it after reading the reviews, until I saw a Groupon and decided to try it out....so glad I did! We went in this Monday morning, and were kindly greeted and seated. I was glad the waiter asked if we had wanted to order off the kitchen menu, because I hate having to wave a server down to order a salad or teryaki.  The decor was clean and contemporary. The sushi was VERY fresh and there were many interesting rolls I haven't tried before (mango, strawberry, and Ahi being a few-Ahi turned out to be our favorite roll here!!), with the my favorite rainbow and tiger rolls too! Portions were a bit smaller than Teharu, but I'd rather have quality over quantity. Prices per plate were about the same, if not exactly the same. Drinks were refilled promptly, and we didn't have to ask for our check like we usually do at Teharu. The place is huge, so I couldn't imagine having a long wait either.   Only suggestion for the owners: provide a fork, and have ginger out. Otherwise, excellent...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi itself tasted bland to me but the experience was so fun for the kids. Yes, the servings andvrolls are small. We tried a little bit of everything but the onkyvthing all of us loved is the dumplings. Go figure. It adds up quick so don't go on an empty stomach because it'll take a lot to get full."}
{"text":"Horrible. There were only a handful of rolls on the belt and from the looks of it they had been there for a while. We tasted a couple of plates and they were terrible, very fishy tasting, not fresh at all. The iced tea was even bad. We ate a couple of pieces and left. We saw another group try a bite, spit it out, and leave right away as well. This place should be shut down by the health department."}
{"text":"Love the selection of sushi they have. Very different types than I am used to but also some originals. Always leave the place full and for a great price! Always check groupon before you head over. They often have a deal!"}
{"text":"I try and stop by for an early dinner once or twice a month at Ahi Revolving Sushi.  It is quick, reasonable, clean, and decent quality sushi.  I generally prefer Nigiri style sushi and the tuna maguro and salmon saki here are quite good for the money.  There is plenty of easy parking and the service has always been very good.  For a conveyor belt sushi place they have a really good variety of sushi rolls.  If you know what you want and don't need the interaction with the sushi chef this place is just fine.  Just don't expect Scottsdale quality sushi for these prices. If you keep your receipt and bring it back you get a discount on your next visit.  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"It's a great place for the lunch. You eat quick and the sushi is good. I recommend ordering you rolls so they are made fresh"}
{"text":"What fun! Our 9 year old loved it!  Nice to see what you want to eat that you might never order because you didn't know it existed!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of sushi and great priced. Excellent service and recommend it for every sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Place is bomb!!!!!! Sushi service drinks tvs everywhere...rolls are #1 in the Z ...especially Gilbert"}
{"text":"DONT DO IT!!! If you want fresh sushi don't come here. Absolutely horrible  its a belt that goes around the whole restaurant things don't look so fresh what so ever.you can grab a card off the belt and have it made the card is a disgusting stinky gross The last thing I want to do is touch or somebody else's  nasty sticky fingers  that I don't know or want to know where they have been.The tempura shrimp was very very soggy because it's on the belt and it has a cover on it and the flavor not great. Sorry but I'll just stick to my fresh sushi  where somebody makes it and brings it to me right away without it being on a belt  for who knows how long,and holy guacamole on the belt they have fruit cups and pudding cups from Costco for dessert you have got to be kidding me. I so hope I don't get sick tonight. Not sure if it was the owner or just one of the workers has two of her kids they're running around like heathens and this is a Saturday night... so the moral of the story is we won't be back"}
{"text":"Walked in at 530pm on a Wednesday night and the place was empty. We are the only three here! Interior was unique however it was warm inside making it slightly uncomfortable. It was also dark inside. Everything had a slight stickiness to it, ie the soy sauce, the sushi counter, etc. They played Stevie Nicks and Heart over and over...  slight headache starting. And now I'm starting to sweat. The menu offered some different options that I hadn't see with conveyor sushi. The heart sushi's were good and different. Strawberry and crab sushi seemed a little odd. I didn't even bother to try it. Conveyor belt didn't offer a lot to choose from tho.... it was almost empty. The waiter was attentive and kind. He knew his menu. I have a feeling we might have hit an off night or we were there too early. We will give it another shot!"}
{"text":"So I've been meaning to try this place and when I stopped by the first time they were still under construction so I waited for a couple of weeks and they were finally opened. I went here during lunch to get something quick and easy. I went in not expecting a whole lot from this place since I haven't really been too impressed with a lot of the revolving sushi restaurants here in AZ. It was really slow when I went during lunch, which I understand since sushi isn't really an ideal place to eat or have for lunch anyways...  The outside and inside of this place is actually pretty big and they have 3 main tables where the revolving sushi rotates around. I sat down and just looked at all their sushi rolls that they had and I can immediately tell that they weren't really that fresh. It looked like they've been sitting out for awhile and the avocados on some of the rolls were just looking a little too dark. Their Las Vegas roll was super cold, some of their rolls were just kind of falling apart and didn't really look like rolls anymore. I was not impressed and I was not satisfied with my lunch that day either so after approximately 30 min. of being there we just paid and left and I ended up getting Chickfila nuggets after =/  Service was ok, I can't really complain about our waitress really since we were the only ones in there but she was nice and she kept asking if we needed anything. There were also 3 young sushi chefs that were in the sushi bar area right across from us where we sat and when we walked in they just starred and didn't even acknowledge us and said hi or anything."}
{"text":"Service was good but the sushi was just ok.  The place was pretty empty and the ambiance is not too inviting.  Perhaps on a busier night they may have a better atmosphere and selection of sushi."}
{"text":"I was supremely excited about a revolving sushi restaurant. I was severely disappointed. The sushi was mostly rice, which is just bad form. The flavors were almost nonexistent. The quality of the fish was obviously poor, it was tough and chewy. The dessert was a joke! There was a cheap variety of desserts I wouldn't touch with a ten foot poll. The server was very friendly, but took a long break right in the middle of our visit, so when we went to pay, it was very confusing and we ended up staying an extra ten minutes due to confusion amongst the servers and the misplacing of our check. It was ridiculous. It was a fun time, because my inexperienced boyfriend got to try out a bunch of different kinds of rolls, but I would not ever choose to go back willingly."}
{"text":"All of the food was warm( not good for sushi) service was very slow. We were very disposed in this place. This is the 2nd time we have tried this place and will be our LAST!"}
{"text":"Ahi Revolving sushi was a great experience. The servers were very friendly and the food was good. Even though the sushi on the conveyor belt was room temperature, the sushi was good. I like the idea of being able to try many different varieties of rolls for $1-4, instead of buying a whole roll at a restaurant for $10-15 with the possibility of not liking it. I tried a cream puff, which was absolutely delicious, california roll, an eel roll, and a custom roll. I had to ask the server what to put into the roll. It did not take very long. Overall, the sushi was good. I have had better, but you do get what you pay for.  The atmosphere was most definitely fun and eccentric. The decor was very contemporary reminded me of anime. I asked one of the servers what music was playing and he said Kpop, which I found very cute. I like the fact that you can choose to sit at the bar or at a table.  Customer service was impeccable. Our server immediately sat us down and was friendly. He was constantly asking if everything was okay. By the end of our time there, I asked the server what language he spoke because he did not speak much English. He said Chinese and was very willing to teach us a few words. He even taught us how to write a few words. Overall, the experience was pleasurable and delightful."}
{"text":"Its good for a drop by. Tonight they played some odd organ music super loud, and had one server for about 25 guests. Not the best."}
{"text":"Excellent selection, great environment, friendly staff, and good sushi. What else could you ask for??"}
{"text":"The sushi was super fresh.  Sooo many  different  styles to choose from.  We brought our son who ended up buying straight from the menu.  Still an awesome experience  for a Friday night out. Come and enjoy.. take your time!"}
{"text":"The last 4 years have not been good to this place. Went back and the place was empty. There were only a couple plates on the rotating bar  and I ventured to try one and it was the definition of room temperature. I didn't risk trying anything else and paid for my plate and left."}
{"text":"I really hate giving any restaurant lower than 3 stars. After all, it's they're livelihood and yelp is inundated with people who don't know that the numbers 2 through 4 exist.   HOWEVER - This place was just a bad experience for me and my girlfriend. Not the worst, but we've been to several revolving sushi places in AZ (like Teharu  or Seksun), and Ahi is by far the least impressive. The food was well-made, but the quality of ingredients was FAR from what they were charging for. The staff weren't too friendly and even the chefs looked miserable. Their specialty rolls are definitely unique and set themselves apart from other sushi places, but none were all that impressive tasting, for the amount of ingredients they contained.  Overall, while it's exciting to have a revolving sushi bar in Gilbert, this place just had all the fun of a dilapidated Chuck-E-Cheeses, but with fish on a conveyor belt."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my house , My husband and i were looking for a place to eat sushi so we gave it a try. I've read the comments in regards to this place being pretty empty , but to me that was not enough reason not to go. We ended up arriving there on a Wednesday around 7:30 their happy hour ends at 9:00 pm, so it all worked out ( and yes , indeed it was empty except for another couple , but this didn't affect my experience)  This is a revolving sushi so you can just grab plates as you please, however they don't really keep any fresh sushi on the conveyor belt unless they get busier ( which is totally ok with me ...as I wouldn't want to get food poisoning) they have pictures of the sushi on the plates so you can grab them and the chef will start making the sushi right in front of you , I had the Las Vegas roll and I have to say that it was great ! They also give you complementary miso sup with tofu and it was pretty tasty, Or you can also order from the menu . My hubby and i loved the music the played , in general it was a good atmosphere and vibe , the owner has great customer service skills , he kept asking us if we were ok, the only thing I believe they need to focus on more is the cleanliness of the restrooms , maybe hire some more staff to take care of that , besides that hubby and i will return again for some sushi and I gotta mention they have great prices as well."}
{"text":"Over priced compared to other places.  One star for variety of the sushi and one for friendliness of staff."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for this place and decided to try it. Pretty nice place with urban decor and a fun revolving sushi concept. The service was a bit slow, but it was Friday, the place was packed and there was a game on. So I am not complaining :) the sushi varieties were decent and well priced. I loved the concept of revolving sushi, because not only is it fun, you get to try so much variety rather than getting stuck with an entire roll.  I would visit again. Oh and I also got Sake for a penny for checking into yelp :) yayy!!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week and it's always good. Sushi is always fresh and they'll make rolls from scratch with no problem. Employees are always pretty cool and make you feel welcome  The red dragon roll is my favorite!"}
{"text":"We really like the theme of this Sushi Restaurant.  You arrive, sit down, and immediately start picking out your sushi from the conveyor system.  The rolls were just ok at best.  The creme puffs looked great but were horrible.  We will probably go again, just will stay away from the tasteless desserts.  Order your edamame fresh.  It was cold from the revolving display."}
{"text":"Much better then last time I was here! They have a new owner and the sushi is better. Its fun if you don't expect top quality sashimi. Just good cheap rolls and friendly service."}
{"text":"I saw a Groupon for this place and decided to buy it, since Ahi is pretty close to my home and was interested in trying something other than Teharu. The deal was $14 for $28 worth of food and drinks (non-alcoholic). My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a weeknight and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I was OK with waiting because after reading the reviews, it's better to wait because sushi is put out more frequently and in turn is fresh(er). Décor is funky, but in a cool contemporary way. The light fixtures above the entrance kind of reminded me of the Cosmopolitan in Vegas.   Once seated, we were able to start picking sushi off the conveyer belt and begin eating. We also decided to order several fresh rolls, including the Vegas Roll, Rainbow Roll, Philly Roll and Spicy Scallop hand roll. Overall service was OK and rolls took about 15 minutes to get. In the meantime, we ate the spring rolls, Alaska roll, dessert and my surprising favorite, the strawberry roll! I have never seen fruit in a sushi roll but this roll was SO tasty, and only $2!! Later, I also saw a banana tempura roll but was too full to try it. Overall, this place has good tasting sushi and really good prices. We walked out of there paying an additional $15 with tip after a $14 groupon. We ate more than $40 worth of sushi so we saved a good amount with the Groupon.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Is AZ cool, cultured, and hip enough for this place?  Hmmmm....  The revolving sushi thing was big with the Yuppies in the Bay Area CA when I lived there in the 80's and I'm glad to see it back.  So, I would really like to see this place make it.  However, being that I try to be a fair critic, there will be some cons as well as pros.  Ahi has a nice, clean and bright atmosphere, that's not too busy and dizzy with the decor.  There are flat screen TV's all around the walls.  Plates go by slow enough to easily grab one off.  They have plates that are simply color coded for pricing. Even I could do the math.  Pricing is very reasonable. Service was good.  Music was of good choice (says me), but could have been turned down just a hair.  Take notice of their hours.  Lots of the usual choices for sashimi in this place, including a few interesting ones I have not seen before.  Tried the tuna, eel, and salmon.  All were fine.  The only thing I have to mention is the wasaaaabi seems to have been from powder.  Don't like raw fish?  Not to worry.  Here are a few of the yummy food-stuff you can grab off of the revolving belt:  California roll, spring rolls with sauce, soy beans in shell (how do you spell that word?), coconut shrimp, and more.  DESSERTS! Here is an idea that occurred to me while watching the revolving plates... This is a great place to just pop in real quick for a slice of $3.00 cheesecake, or pay only $1.50 for a plate of cream puffs, or get a small slice of cake that I bet is right about the size for calorie counters.  They may need to go back to the drawing board for the lids they use on the little plates that go around.  For the most part, they work ok.  But until this place gets hoppin', which I hope it does, the lids need to fit on more snug.  That way if food goes around more than once, it doesn't get slightly dried out.  It's mostly the sushi that has rice on the outside of it that gets a little dry.  They have a menu at the table so you can order fresh sushi made just for you that is brought to the table.  This worked out well for my California rolls.  KIDS -  There were some well behaved children while we were there. They have tables that seat 4, and the kids were on the outside, more away from the food.  But honestly?  Ask yourself if your child can resist pulling the pretty plates off of the conveyer belt.  Might just be too tempting for them?  Extra note here.... The drinking ice water is good.  This counts for a lot in my book."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a sweet and friendly waiter and the chef, that served us with excellence! We chose to sit in the center where we could see the chef do his magic. The chef even asked us how we liked the food, in which was very good! Price is not bad AT ALL. It was my first time going here & definitely not my last!"}
{"text":"Ahi is a chill place to go eat with friends. I think by the end of the night I got like 7 plates of food for only 13$! Riley is a great server too! Try and sit in his zone because he's really fun to talk to"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Although we did walk in with an overwhelming amount of people. The sushi you can tell has been sitting on the conveyor belt for a long time. Not bright or fresh. So what I did ask for was for the chefs to make a fresh alaskan and Hawaiian roll. The rolls came out in under 5 minutes. Sketchy I think. My guess is that they had some in a fridge and just served it to us. Doesn't make it fresh when its pre made. My 4 year old son had a kids chicken teriyaki. The server handed us an adults chicken teriyaki. You would think with a mistake like that you think, \"awesome more food anyways!\"... NO. The chicken looked like sliced frozen microwaved turkey. HORRIBLE. I then said if all else fails, why not try dessert?! So I ordered strawberry mochi ice cream. Didn't have strawberry so I decided to go with the mango instead. Biting into the mango mochi ice cream was like biting into dried play doh that had been sitting out for 5 hours. I'm a mochi lover so I know this is not how the consistency of mochi should have been. Mochi is suppose to soft and chewy. I didn't get that. So I pulled the waitress aside and explained to her I could not eat it. She was kind enough to offer me a different dessert. Plain and simple, I would never go back.   *The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because of the service I received from the kind waitress. The quality of food and sushi, 1 star."}
{"text":"nice place with lackluster service and food. Depressed staff and McDonalds quality sushi... good for a quick stop if you want quantity over quality..."}
{"text":"Super dead especially for being 12pm / lunch. Only thing on the belt we're California Rolls and Spicy Tuna. Not fresh rather warm. I had one roll and left hungry because I was so grossed out and worried about the food safety. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"They mean well but the staff tends to make interactions very awkward. Sushi is so-so, but the for the price what more can you expect. Once had an order error and the staff explained to me that part of the issue was that none of their sushi chefs actually speak English."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. It's cheap. They could improve their business simply and quickly by doing the following:  1. Leave chopsticks and soy sauce dish at every place setting. Why do I need to wait to get chopsticks?  2. Ibid, ginger and wasabi. Put it on the conveyor belt.   3. Put more sushi out. We had a group of 6 and could have spent 30-40% more if there were better options available. We all waited a long time to see something we wanted. Also more nigiri. Some of us left hungry.  4. Keep the drinks coming, again if you order something it will take awhile. Just bring drinks when it looks like someone is out.   5. More nigiri. I ate one order of nigiri all night.   I'll come back in a few weeks and see if they've improved at all."}
{"text":"This place is great to go for great sushi at cheap prices!  My wife and I come here every other week or so.  The staff is very friendly and personable.  We have Eric every time and he does a great job.  We have a ton of sushi and I have a Saki bomb and my wife has a glass of wine and we have never exceeded $40.00.  Yea, this isn't the trendy place to be and often times it is pretty empty.  But, if it is great cheap sushi you want and thats it, Ahi can't be beat!!!!  Their fried rice is excellent too, and cost only $1.00.  We are customers for life!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome set up! I love the river with the boats carrying sushi!  It was so much fun picking my dishes from the never-ending stream of sushi! Great service too! I usually dislike sushi, but I thoroughly enjoyed what I got. Still pricy, but then again, it IS sushi."}
{"text":"Omg so this place use to be under muuuch better management than it is as of a month ago, bad service, they took out chicken skewers, smaller portion sizes (really small pieces of shrimp inside shrimp avocado), and they make your sushi smaller if you order it fresh. They lost the magic touch, now it's a terrible place. We use to come here every single Monday to eat all you can eat, it became a tradition up until new management RUINED IT. if the Old business managers EVER see this review, please contact me, maybe we can begin a sushi venture together. I give ahi another year or two before they drive it straight into the ground.. cheap prices but now it's no good."}
{"text":"Two friends and I met here for a girls dinner out. We were all newbies and all really enjoyed it! It was so fun to see all the pretty rolls come around on the conveyor belt, and we enjoyed the several we had, as well as an order of gyoza. The edamame was a little lacking - it just didn't have a really fresh taste. It was almost a little mealy.  Our waitress was sweet and helpful but seemed pretty inexperienced. She admitted to us that she didn't know how to open a bottle of wine as the reason for why my drink was delayed. She also spilled a whole tray of waters on the table behind us. Not a big deal to have inexperienced servers when you're not having to depend on them for your food, but it just made the experience a bit less polished than it could have been.  One funny note - one of the options that was available on the conveyor belt was dessert. That included pudding (chocolate and vanilla snack packs) and mixed fruit (in a pop top can). We were all moms so could see some of the wisdom in those options, but it was still amusing.  All in all, a good experience and I will plan to return!"}
{"text":"I have never had a worse experience at a sushi bar before tonight. I brought my friend there tonight because I thought she'd enjoy it. Literally, we were ignored. The server did not once come by to check up on us, even for a water refill. We had to constantly get up from the table or call someone. It was incredibly annoying. Servers are not entitled to a tip. If there is no service, then no tip will be provided. I will never return to this establishment and I'll make sure none of my friends go. I'd get better service at a fast food restaurant like McDonald's than here."}
{"text":"I love this place! With the sushi on the conveyer belts you are able to grab whatever looks good  & pay by the plate. Really decently priced. I've feed a family of 6 for around $50. I love the crab items personally & usually grab a good 10 plates. The red dragon is my favorite."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place, I on the other hand was not so impressed. I admit the whole revolving Sushi belt is cute. You can sample lots of diconversationhes without waiting, prices correlate with plate colors eg yellow plate $1.50 or purple plate is $2 50. The seating is not great if you have more than 2~3 ppl because then you are side by side making conversation difficult. The sushi was ok, not great and I was put off by the pudding and fruit cups that were also on the conveyor belt...Dole fruit cups in a tin...smh"}
{"text":"Where to begin. We found ourselves here because of a groupon.. Good deal so we thought we would give it a try. The service started off on a bad note. As we came in there were several open tables and seats at the counter that just needed to be cleaned. We were told 5-10 min wait, after 20 minutes we were finally brought to the counter with the open seats around us full of dirty dishes, not the most appealing. When our waitress came to take our drink order she had no idea what a Kirin Light was and ended up bringing regular Kirin beer, when I asked for the correct beer she rushed off but never returned. I had to ask a separate server. Long story short I thought the service was terrible.   As for the sushi... Maybe it is a me problem because I have higher expectations but this sushi was pretty bad. The concept of the revolving belt is that the plates are color coordinated: white=$1 yellow=$1.5 blue=$2 purple=$2.5 and black=$3. Anything that looked edible was blue or above. With that being said there were a few things that came by that I thought were decent but it was one of those places where all the rolls tasted the same... Suped up California roll. I think my favorite thing I ate were the spring rolls.   While I love the concept of the revolving sushi we have yet to find a place that does it well. We will not be back. Our bill without the groupon would have been about $60... I will take my business to Masa down the street for cheap but fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"Ehhh   It's $1-3 sushi. You don't expect much. But freshness is all gone now ! Maybe because summer in az is so slow for business.  Had salmon and even as Asian as I am couldn't swallow it o-o). Lol and albacore looked like dried jerky !    W that being said it's spinning sushi, can't be fresh though this location lately is bad , but Kids love them! Lol so 3 stars for cheap, happy kids meal!  But stay away from anything raw .    He likes egg sushi and coconut shrimp.      Server is alway pleasant  :)  I'll just let the kid eat his non raw items and I'll eat at home lol"}
{"text":"Sushi is ok, not the best, but decent given the prices. We came in on a Saturday during lunch and it was not crowded at all. Great place if you want to satisfy your sushi craving fast. The nigiri was pretty good and overall the sushi was very fresh. Lots of selection too."}
{"text":"Delaney was an awesome waitress! We came in late on a Sunday and she was seriously THEE best! Super honest and attentive! Plus she dresses super cute! She made the experience so much more!"}
{"text":"*Do not let these fancy pictures fool you* I first dined at this establishment when it first opened, and they were fantastic and very clean. My wife and I just moved back to the area, and I decided to take her here based on good memories. As soon as I say down I was very, very hesitant due to the fact that the first player I removed from the moving line up was a warmish California roll, so to avoid possibly getting sick we decided to order from the menu's instead for a fresher option. \"Wrong\" it seemed like they just walked around and picked the items off the belt as the cold were getting warm and the warm items were cold. After eating we went home I felt slightly sick to my stomach didn't think much of it until my wife was sick and dizzy with food poisoning symptoms. This place was great but now cleanliness is out all of their domes covering the food have grit and whatever else on them and the belts have food mush and crumbs all over. Clean, clean, clean please but new plastic domes fix this place."}
{"text":"The variety of sushi has definitely gotten better over time. My favorite is the Strawberry Rolls; they are absolutely amazing!! It's good to come about an hour after they have opened so everything is fresh and the warm things are warm."}
{"text":"The sushi was not very authentic, this is the first time I have actually had lettuce in a roll. Gyoza dipping sauce was good, garlic edamame was really eel sauce maybe teriyaki sauce with minced garlic from a jar. I put in a request for a crunch roll and received a spicy salmon roll with tempura flake. Miso soup was good, hot and sour was not very spicy, tasted very watered down. Grilled chicken w/ rice was ok. Don't be discouraged if this is your first visit to a revolving sushi bar, there are others(TEHARU) that are very good. Selections were limited."}
{"text":"If I work late and just want a quick, no-frills dinner for myself, I like popping by Ahi Revolving Sushi. I'll slide in around 8:30pm and I'm out by 9. Also by the time I go they have Happy Hour pricing on their rolls and I get a free miso soup.  Service from the servers and sushi bar chefs is always very friendly.  Whenever I am in the mood for belt-style sushi, my choice is between Teharu (Tempe) or Ahi Revolving Sushi. Teharu (Tempe) is more convenient for me to get to, but their rice to fish/filling proportion is pretty horrendous and poorly rolled. The rolls at Ahi Revolving Sushi are much better proportioned and rolled better. So I find myself driving a little further to go to Ahi Revolving Sushi."}
{"text":"I love the revolving belt and excellent happy hour prices allowing you to easily try several things. The teriyaki chicken bowl was fresh and delicious. I'm excited for the Korean BBQ place next door!"}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times. The last 2 trips were not good. Slow service and the food quality has dropped. On this last trip we weren't even talked to for  10 minutes after being seated. No drink order, no nothing, sure is fun with 2 kids.   I don't think we'll be back unless the owner can explain why the decline in service and food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite. Superrrrr friendly service from Katherine, she was SO sweet from the moment we walked in. Sushi was okay, nothing special but not bad either. It's revolving sushi guys so, it won't be the freshest of the fresh. The atmosphere was quiet, I would suggest changing the music to liven the place up.   All in all, we left full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"You get good sushi for a really good price way better than RA more bang for your buck"}
{"text":"It was very clean, and the service was great. Actually too great, we had multiple servers that checked in on us about every 5 minutes which actually got to be distracting at the frequency. The seating is absolutely cramped, I felt claustrophobic.  Food was mediocre. Nothing was horrible (just very bland) and the nothing was absolutely amazing (Explosion roll was the best). Everything was room temperature which threw me off, but didn't ruin the food.  I will go back because of the pricing and the variety. I love being able to try lots of rolls and new combos in a few bites, and if I don't like it, it's ok, I didn't waste $10 for a large roll like at most restaurants.   I am worried that on a Friday night that only half of the restaurant's revolving lines were open and there were several parking spots right out front. Hope they make it. It's a great concept, the food just needs more flavor."}
{"text":"This place is no good. I've been 3 times, the first time I ate inside and the sushi was warm but the prices were really good. The second time I got take out and it was good.   The third and final time they over charged me by about $5. Their menu says the spicy tuna roll is $4.5 but I was charged $6 and the teriyaki is supposed to be $6.5, but I was charged $8.  I was going to call and complain but then I tasted the chicken teriyaki, the taste was almost indescribable. The chicken was almost stringy and was clearly uncooked and the was wet and sticky and was like rice pudding than a side of rice. After attempting to eat it I knew complaining would be a waste of time because I'll never go back.  Below is a picture of the chicken and their to go menu and my bill"}
{"text":"Had a experience here tonight! Delicious food and great service from Kate! We did the all you can eat sushi and got more than our money's worth. Kate's welcoming energy and above and beyond service was exceptional. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This conveyor belt sushi restaurant is huge! Spacious seating is a plus over Teharu, which for some reason always has half of the seating closed off when I've been there. The interior is cute, and the conveyor belts themselves go by at a slow enough pace that you can grab what you want.   We came here on a Sunday evening, and had no problem getting a seat for 4 people. There were a decent number of people already seated with stacks of colored plates at their tables. The prices of the plates range from $1 to $3, with most plates in the $2 and $2.50 range. The $3 plates that I saw were either cheesecakes or eel nigiri sushi. We grabbed several rolls, some edamame, and 2 salads (Seaweed and squid).  The rolls come in sets of 3, and the size/width of them generally increases with the plate price. Since it's conveyor belt sushi, it's not the best quality, nor did it taste like the freshest sushi, but you go for the concept and to have fun picking out your plates.   The best tasting plates I had were the soy-marinated tuna (Although one piece did have some gristle on it, but hey what do you expect from a $2 plate), and the banana tempura roll. We tried another tempura roll (non-dessert), which tasted like it had been made way ahead of time since the fried breading tasted gummy and soft.  Our total for 4 people with 2 fountain drinks was a little over $40 with tax. Service was great, another plus over Teharu, and drinks were refilled promptly and the waiters were very friendly.  We hadn't heard of this restaurant before until it got posted on Groupon. It's a decent choice for cheap, fast sushi with friendly service and nice atmosphere. If you're in Gilbert and craving sushi, it's a good inexpensive choice!"}
{"text":"Here's the low down on this place. The owner does not speak English, not even broken. The service is pretty terrible, you will definitely wait for anything to be served to you, so make sure you're an extremely patient person. There is only one server there that actually does an excellent job, if he's not there we always turn around and walk right out and head over to Teharu (not that their service is really any better). That gentleman deserves a raise, or promotion to management. He has gorgeous blue eyes and cute somewhat higher voice. The rest of the servers look like they could use a bath to be honest. The cooks are really nice and they are clean, they keep their area clean and if you sit by them they will help you if you need anything. Very friendly and welcoming.  The sushi is average, it's not bad or mind blowing. They do have a really good smoked salmon nigiri. This place is only good if you're really hungry and want to eat some inexpensive sushi. It is clear the owner and Managment do not care about reviews or complaints since nothing has changed. I've gone several times hoping things will change and they have not. This place could be really great but the service their really brings it down. Don't waste your time, and make the drive to Sushi Station in Phoenix. The service there is incredible. They actually refill your drinks, even on the busy night. Ahi should take note. Two star rating thanks to the cooks and that one server, they truly deserve the 5 star but the other folks do not."}
{"text":"First of all, before you come here expecting $20 type sushi dishes, you're getting what you pay for.   I love the sushi for the price. It's not bad at all! The most expensive dish you're going to get is the $3. Let me recommend the volcano roll. Best sushi available: it's cheap for its price, and has hot scallops stacked on top from the toaster oven! I get the forest roll as well because I love the cold seaweed on top of it.   I admit the service is slow, but the staff are young and friendly. They're always so sweet every time I go. I suggest you ORDER to the server what you want, and if you're lucky (they're not on the belt yet or don't get put out), you get fresh sushi straight from the chef that don't sit out.   Complimentary miso soup every time so ask for that as well!   I understand the many \"below average\" reviews but that's because people come to this place expecting expensive creme de la creme sushi when the most expensive is $3. There's pros and cons about this place. If you come here understanding it's not going to be the most tasty sushi you've ever had, it's good. It settles the craving for sushi."}
{"text":"Like a lot of other reviewers a Groupon led me to this place. If you have been to Teharu it is a very similar concept: Conveyer belt w/ different kinds of sushi passing around. If you've never tried it out before I recommend it (especially if you have a group of people that have different tastes).    I like this place better than Teharu because their sushi options are much larger. They have basics like a Vegas roll, salmon (sake) roll and California roll, but they also have a few unique ones. Last time I was in I had a strawberry tuna roll. It sounds bizarre but it was really creative and very tasty!  The only reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is because their miso soup sucks. That and if you order a hot green tea you get a cup with a Lipton green tea bag in it, not a teapot with fresh brewed like you'd imagine."}
{"text":"This place is solid. But you have to understand... it's kaiten-zushi. You won't be enjoying fat pieces of molten toro here, nor will the unagi be freshly broiled, succulent deliciousness. But if you just want a quick sushi fix, you could do a LOT worse. And I have to say- some of the things that I tried were REALLY tasty (the 'salmon nigi' was especially nice).  The service was really friendly- I don't think that my glass of water was ever less than two-thirds full. They seem to really be making an honest attempt at running a good business, I think that people need to just keep their expectations in check."}
{"text":"Bought the $10 for $20 Yelp Deal. Totally worth it!!! We were promptly seated, and all my favorites kept coming out. Rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, seaweed salad, unagi. Yummy! I was pleased with everything, except (ironically) the Happy Roll. It made me unhappy, bc it was chewy. We'll definitely be back. Next time I'm going to check in on Yelp, bc you can get a free milk shake."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant, and we were assisted right away, by someone that was very nice and polite...we've never been in a revolving sushi bar before and didn't really know how it worked, and we had the all you can eat...she instructed us very well! The food was great! What made it even better is our server was on point. I was a server before and I appreciated how attentive she was...our drinks were always full and she made sure we were having a good night. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Second visit here.  Prices are good. Twice experienced less than average quality of fish.    Twice also experienced poor service.   Will not go back."}
{"text":"For the last two weeks, I have been to Ahi 3 times. I love that there is a revolving belt that allows me to try new rolls that I otherwise would not order. I LOVE their Jalapeño Popper things. They are so good. There is always someone constantly making new rolls and putting them out. This place also has decent prices. Pretty comparable to other revolving belt sushi places. I like that the restaurant is always clean and has good decor."}
{"text":"I don't normally choose sushi restaurants that have a conveyor belt bc I don't want to get sick. Pulling up to the building the parking lot was empty at 630 on a Tuesday.. Ok fine, only 1 table in the entire restaurant and we were seated right next to them. Hmm. Ok. My bf decided to pull off a plate bc we were all hungry. It was like a shaggy dog - imitation crab salad roll with tempura crunchies it looked ok, came in 4 pieces. A friend ate 1 piece and said we needed to leave and my bf tried some of the imitation crab and was done. They described it as warm rice with room temp inside and disgusting. We cancelled out drinks and tossed a 5$ on the table and proceeded to leave. The waitress hurriedly rung us up for $2.12. Worst $5 we ever spent on food.  With that being said  - the sushi that passed us didn't look fresh and if it only takes not even a bite to turn you off that's not a risk I'm willing to take. We found another sushi restaurant - yanagi and it was welcoming, delicious and satisfying"}
{"text":"The concept is great. The food is good to fair, depending on the dish. The service was quite poor. There were several instances we were provided the wrong order, which could have proved to be dangerous had we not caught it, due to serious food allergies. When pointed out that we were given the wrong order, we were told it was our fault and charged anyhow, even though the order slip was found and indicated the mistake was theirs. Seeing a pattern of getting orders wrong, we attempted to reconfirm our next order numerous times...just to ultimately get another wrong order. We made the best of it. Overall, cool concept, tasty food, but with poor customer service and some operational flaws. The price was very reasonable though."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a groupon. It was alright. The portions were small. I liked the variety and place."}
{"text":"I'm a big sushi person and I haven't really done much revolving sushi. However, this place gave me a \"meh\" feeling towards it. I hope there are better revolving sushi places out there because I don't want this to be a permanent feeling.   I came here with some great friends and of course I was feeling sushi and was super ready to grub down plates on plates. The outcome however didn't lead that way. The sushi here was very small and the flavoring of each roll just didn't give me that satisfied taste. I had this peanut roll and that just gave me the worst aftertaste. I would no recommend it, maybe it's just me. The tempura roll, crab roll, and Caterpillar roll just wasn't hitting my taste bud as well. They just didn't have the kick of flavor and it felt like the sushi has been there for a while just rotating around collecting air. The staff was pretty slow at getting back to us at well. But I don't want to blame the staff, maybe he was new?   I wouldn't really recommend this place to a friend, especially if they haven't experienced this yet. it would scar myself and make me not change  my thoughts on sushi."}
{"text":"Won't be back.  Sat down at the table for 10 min.  They couldn't be bothered to serve us.  Sushi chef looking right at us numerous times.  Servers too busy goofing around.  Too many other places in the area to take my money!!"}
{"text":"Great for fast food sushi! Decent prices, good variety, clean and friendly service. You must try if you are a sushi lover, but not the kind that has made sushi a delicacy with its outrageous prices here in AZ, but the kind of sushi lover that just wants to have their sushi fix without having to save up all month for it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I only had some crunchy rolls but they were bomb as heck and they were very inexpensive and as someone else said the eel sauce as a side was like god giving me a hand like wow so bomb and the cashier guy was friendly and I ordered take out and it was really fast. 10/10 do recommend"}
{"text":"I've come here several times, each time hoping the service and the quality of the food would improve and that I may have just caught them on a bad day. But each time I go, the service remains S-L-O-W (which is quite the feat, considering it's a self-serving revolving sushi restaurant) and the food gets worse and worse. Needless to say, I do NOT recommend eating here if you want good sushi."}
{"text":"It's not an upscale sushi place, so you definitely get what you pay for. I came in here a few times until I heard the health department got on them for some things; haven't returned since. The food is okay. Sushi is on a conveyor belt which can be a concern if it's on there too long. My main issue was with the service...spent more time waiting around for them than actually eating. I'd like to go back eventually; hopefully the service has improved, because the food is actually pretty solid."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon $12 for $25 so I thought I'd check it out. I will never go back!  First thing that was very unpleasant was it was freezing in there. I understand they need to keep sushi cold but if it's fresh they shouldn't need to keep it to where our teeth were chattering. Next thing service was extremely slow. I mean come on it's not like you have to deliver much!   The sushi is shitty. There was only one roll we truly liked. I've had revolving sushi else where and I know it's not 4 star sushi but even for lower end sushi it was not worth money. Most of the rolls reminded me of low grade grocery store sushi.   My fiancé isn't too hip into sushi so he ordered the shrimp tempura. It took at least 20 minutes to come out. When it finally came it was freezing cold, inedible and the fried rice was disgusting.   I ordered a piece of sushi that wasn't on the belt and again took forever! I had to give the waiter a displeasing look as he stood around before he realized he forgot.   Do yourself a favor take you money else where even with a Groupon not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I would consider us regulars at this place. Every time we go it is understaffed. Management is seriously lacking. Riley, who seems like the only server here, is usually running around with no help and getting buried with orders. In turn, he'll forget to come back with something. Management, hire another server!!!! Poor guy is running all over the place and not able to provide A+ service.   Now moving on to the busser... I can dig the grunge look, but you're at work. Brush your hair and tie that mop up! The past few times we came in, we see dirty tables EVERYWHERE. Piles of dishes and cups as they tell you, \"please sit anywhere you'd like\". Uh huh... Theres no clean tables. Meanwhile busser is in the back hanging out with someone. Really guy? Your job is easy enough!    The sushi is not bad. As many others have said, you get what you pay for. What I did not like was that the lids to the plates always seem to be coming off as they go around the conveyor belt. They are morphed, cracked, and dirty. Please replace them. Miso soup was cold.   I'm sad this place has gone so far downhill. We will miss you Ahi sushi! Please get better so we can come back"}
{"text":"this was my first experience with the conveyor belt type sushi. The sushi was not good at all. poor quality and tasteless. prices were very cheap which is probably why it was not tasty..."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt awesomeness! Big selection, good prices! Just not as fresh as we would like. But Much fresher than some we've been too and they'll make anything you want!"}
{"text":"My girl and I  walk in on a Thursday around 6:00 pm.  BIG sign out front saying \"Please wait to be seated.\"  I look around and the place is dimly lit...not in a romantic way, mind you, but more in that, \"we just forgot to change the light bulbs\" depressing kind of way. After a few minutes of waiting in front of the large \"Please wait to be seated\" sign, a woman carrying a plastic soda cup while drinking out of it comes towards us and mumbles something about how if, we don't \"see a hostess, just go ahead and seat yourself.\"  Fine, then what the hell is the purpose for the sign?  We walked about three steps towards a booth holding the dingy menus shoved at us, glanced at the sparse and lonely sushi rolls bouncing on the rusty conveyer belt and decided to run away as fast as possible. This place is like something out of a David Lynch movie.  Bizarre.  Maybe I was having a flashback?  No clue.  Not a fan.  Will not think of returning."}
{"text":"I feel really bad posting a one star review but this place was pretty awful. We went at 6pm and it wasn't super busy but we had very poor service. There were only two servers working so i don't know if that's the norm or not. The tables and menus were sticky and the overall cleanliness of the dining area was questionable. The rolls on the conveyer belt were few and far between...but oddly enough there were lots of pudding cups (like pre-packages pudding cups). We ordered rolls and it took almost an hour for those to come out. The dynamite roll I ordered had undercooked (gummy, cold)scallops. I honestly left hoping none of us get sick. Pretty bummed at the experience.  Update- and unfortunately some of us did get food poisoning. Awesome."}
{"text":"Warm sushi... Cold soggy calimari ... This place will definitely get you sick or kill you... Superbly disgusted."}
{"text":"OK, but fun.  Asked me to like them on Facebook while in the restaurant for 15% off the bill.  While I'm not a huge fan of restaurants that bribe customers for social media exposure, at least they weren't trying to bribe for 5 star ratings.  The sushi was ok. Good, but not great. The service was pretty good and they were nice to my daughter."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some lunch, saw this place just driving by. Prices are decent, you get about 3 pieces of a roll for the varying prices. I did get a wiff of spoiled food a few times. I dunno what it was from, but it prevented me from furthering our meal. The service is pretty horrendous, our server didn't even know what siracha was. Asked if I meant eel sauce in a condescending tone. Excuse me what?! I tried several different rolls and was not impressed by any of it. My son had the orange chicken and it was so tangy, he nor I could finish it. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I won't be back.  Was craving some sashimi for lunch and this place is right around the corner.  Ordered the lunch sashimi special online, and it said it would take 15 minutes.  Got there 20 minutes after ordering and the host said it would still be another 10 minutes.  Hmmm...okay - there were only 4 other people in the restaurant, so I don't know why it would take that long..but I'd wait.  10 minutes later I get my sushi, get back to work, and no chopsticks!  Boo!  So, I start eating with a fork, take 1 bite and immediately spit it out as it was luke warm and tasted foul.  Wasn't worth possibly getting sick."}
{"text":"I go here a bunch. Always tasty and good service. Will be back. I've never had any issues like the other reviewers on here. It's revolving - so be aware that if you go late at night of course like most establishments the food isn't fresh right before closing. Order from the menu if its an issue."}
{"text":"Checked out Ahi even after reading reviews to see if the reviews were spot on.  The service staff is slow at getting the water out. The wasabi is from a tube squeezed out and the portion was uneven to what I had gotten and my wife's.  There was a promo running all plates were 2 dollars. The selection was decent but the quality was subpar,  the basic California rolls were gross. The rice seem very hard. They had some unusual rolls like banana tempura,  rolls with lettuce.   Best roll there was their explosion and Ahi roll.   The quality for the price is in consistent. Some rolls seem to be good value as other rolls were not. They had items like jello for 2 bucks which is a rip off. We also got dessert,  3 flavors of mochi. Ice cream for 2 bucks each too. Once again a rip off. It's 2 bucks for 1 ice cream with a little whip cream and chocolate syrup.   And the place was insanely lit up I felt like I was dining inside a Walmart with there 100 fluorescent lights.  We won't be returning to this establishment again. There are 2 other ones much better in this area."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had, but good.  The Revolving sushi conveyor is pretty cool and keeps you interested.  They do have a lot of progressive types of foods that come around as well which make you want to try them and they're good.  Got the Groupon so that made it super cheap....3 of us ate for the $12 and they gave me a free green tea shake just for checking in online.  Service is decent, but could be a little better since we had to keep on our waiter about refilling our sodas, but he was usually not far away or too busy so that wasn't a huge deal.  We went for lunch so it was pretty quiet then and we could just take our time and relax.  I'd go there again."}
{"text":"Ahi's a regular go-to for my family when I come to town. The sushi's relatively cheap, but the quality's good for the price. Plus, I don't think many people go to a revolving sushi place expecting a high-end meal.  I don't live in Gilbert these days, but my mom and sister always try to take me for a girls day out lunch when I come to town, and every time I've been by, they've been understaffed to the point of having one server who has to act as the host as well during a peak lunch hour. That being said, our server tried to stay on top of things and was a champ."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi was poor, salmon was discolored.  The overall experience was bad.  we could not understand the waiter and the selection of sushi on the conveyor  belt was poor.  We've eaten here previously and it appears the quality of the fish has gone down hill.  For a Friday night, the restaurant was a ghost town."}
{"text":"I'm torn because the only reason the stars aren't higher is because the service is so slow! But this is my family's go-to place for dinner. The sushi is good and inexpensive and the hot food is great. I have two kids (6 & 5) who love the revolving sushi and the variety works for them, plus there are small dessert options! If the service was more organized and quicker, I'd definitely up it a star."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was kind of hesitant to try this place. Been to Teharu plenty of times. But last night my friend and I decided to give them a try. To my surprise, it was really good. I really like how they had a variety if different rolls versus just the usual California roll and what not. For $35 my friend and left completely stuffed. It was really reasonably priced and you could try a little bit of everything versus paying $12 for a roll at another sushi place. The restaurant was really clean and modern looking and can really fit a lot of people.  It's also a lot closer to me than teharu. :) I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"People are always skeptical about these revolving sushi places but first time here it was good but could have use more variety though on the revolving plates of sushi  You can also order off the revolving plates menu but they didn't have udon available  Overall good sushi/ rolls"}
{"text":"I am a super fan!  Recommendation: 1. Go towards the end of the rush. There is a lot of sushi plates on their way to you from the conveyer belts and you don't have to sit RIGHT next to interesting characters. 2. Get the groupon for 2 people if you are skeptical and (its still available), its $25 off your first visit 3. If you can, sit close to the Sushi Chefs bar. You get first pick and the rolls are not 'slim pickings'  Pros: 1.You get sushi QUICK! 2.You can try several options and not have to spend 8 bucks on a roll you realize you don't like and waste it like other places. (Plates are 1-3 bucks and have 2-3 pieces on them.) 3. The food was decent. If you're one of those die hard sushi fans; its not 5 star restaurant. Its a quick, fun sushi place, not fine dining with flare and ambiance. But if you want a good time, with good quick (keyword quick) sushi, I HIGHLY recommend this place.  Cons: 1. Its kind of all over the place; the waitress staff can sometimes take a while... and I mean 40 minutes to get the check... My recommendation, ask for things like the bill early on, and utilize the staff if you see them walking around even if its not your waiter/waitress. 2. I could see how the temperature could get a little warm during rush hour. Go first before everyone else, or when people start trickling out.  I am a big fan!"}
{"text":"I'm alwayssssss up for trying new sushi! Especially if it's inexpensive and revolving! =)  We had bought a Groupon for this place and it's actually right down the street from my house so we wanted to try it out. I guess I kind of went in with high expectations since my other favorite revolving sushi place is Teharu and I absolutely love them...  I felt like the food portions were sooooo tiny... I felt like they did this on purpose so you keep getting more and more sushi. Not only that but the sushi just didn't taste fresh. I think it was just straight bland. There were a few rolls that had such a strange combination. For example, there was a roll that had peanuts with avocado. No bueno! Then you had your tempura mixed with bananas. lol. I see that they're trying to make their rolls creative but I can't see peanuts, rice and avocado being a good mix.   The only good thing I would say is that the staff was extremely friendly. At the end though we didn't reach our limit on our Groupon and it took them what felt like forever to figure it out. I most likely won't be coming back here to get my sushi fix on. =/"}
{"text":"Time to update the reviews on this place. Me and wife wanted some sushi again, we showed up..glad to see the place was packed and looks like its doing really well for itself.  Something has somewhat changed here. The decor still rocks, but the atmosphere seems some what lacking.   Customer Service: seemed to have slipped here, as with so many patrons that it looks disorganized with 3 people cleaning and resetting a table when there are customers who are waiting for orders or drink refills such as I was.   We also ordered off the menu and it took nearly 15 minutes to bring out half and we never received an avocado roll that was ordered which we waited for 30 minutes for. Our waiter also disappeared for a little bit and none of the other waiters were able to fill his role or help out with the table.   Also one last thing that the workers all seemed unhappy and gave a weird unwelcoming vibe.  Food Quality Does not match pricing any more: They also seemed to have raised the prices now to the point where they are trying to match higher end restaurants. Such as the unagi which I can get for $4-$6 for about 4 pieces here its $4 for a plate for 3 in small sizes. There are hardly any $1 white places and my wife loves avocado rolls which there are none to be seen.   I hope they get their act together soon and reestablish the values it had when it first opened, as me and wife had previously enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"My boys love the revolving sushi . They get so excited. The service never disappoints here. We love watching the chef make sushi. This is our reliable sushi spot. We've been to a few in chandler Gilbert area and we always migrate back to this one."}
{"text":"I used to go to Teharu a lot. By comparison this place is miles ahead. The selection and quality of sushi is better and the service is better. We came on a weekday at 4:30 and the place was nearly empty. The staff went out of their way to meet our needs and help us feel welcomed. The price is comparable to Teharu, my wife and I ate our fill for about $25.  Never going back to Teharu, this place is awesome.  There is a 10% discount for coming on weekdays, just FYI!"}
{"text":"New Revolving sushi in town and a Groupon for it. . . . SOLD! After buying this Groupon deal online we came here last night for dinner. The decor and style of the restaurant was very hip and colorful. The layout of the establishment was horrible. If you were sitting in the inner bar and wanted to use the restroom. You had to walk all the way around and over, Just to get to it.   The service was awesome; friendly and helpful. Thank you, Carlos.    The food: Let's just say I enjoyed the coconut shrimp and fried rice more than the sushi. The sushi was very SMALL portioned and bland - I've been to many revolving sushi establishments around town and never seen/had such a small amount of sushi on a plate for the same price.  PS if it hadn't been for the great service, this place would have gotten a one star."}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing. Waiter was super friendly. With this place you can special order which I liked. The sushi was \"okay\". I would come back if I was in the area. I def did not have to wait 45 minutes like I did with another sushi place so it was worth it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The whole conveyor belt is filled with food the whole time. The hostess/server is really sweet. I don't know her name but she is the one with the cute hipster glasses. She was frequently checking on us to make sure we were ok, and was even concerned whether I liked a new drink I tried. If they don't have an option on the belt just ask and it is real quick to come out"}
{"text":"Just tried the salmon nigiri and yellowtail  - fresh  and prepared right at the table. Had the house hot sake,  priced reasonable for a house blend. If you eat at the sushi bar all the plates are color-coded by price level, so for about 20 bucks including drink and tips you get a nice selection. Even includes a free bowl of delicious miso soup!  I will be back again  - Sam my sushi chef and Maddie my waitress were delightful!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this atmosphere and the peacefulness. Other places like Kona are too loud and over priced. Recommend eating here for a simple date night !"}
{"text":"Scary sushi!! I've been to many conveyor belt sushi bars. Never been so worried about food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon because it looked interesting but had reviews all over the place. It's a fun concept and definitely a unique experience. The sushi is not bad but it's not excellent either. I have discovered though that I really prefer my food to just come to me, I didn't really enjoy having to try to snatch off the belt. The portion sizes are small it's 3 pieces to a plate but the price isn't too bad. So if you're looking for a different experience I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We walked in and the waitress that greeted us said that they were completely full, even though half the restaurant was empty. We asked if we could sit at one of the empty tables and she was like, \"Ummmm I guess...\"  Food was not good, but what do you expect with the prices? You get what you pay for. We had to wait for a LONG time to get our check, our drinks, etc. We will NOT ever be returning and I recommend you take your business elsewhere with all the cute places Gilbert has to offer."}
{"text":"We enjoyed, the experience and now that we know what  a revolving sushi bar will try it again."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We came for my daughter's bday.  She requested to go and of course we were excited.  I was not as impressed as I have been in the past.  It was not as clean as I have seen in the past.  Sushi that was on the conveyor was still revolving when we left.  My Dads and my first plate was warm.  Many of the mini plate covers need replaced.  I have some suggestions...come up with a marking system to gauge how long a plate has been on the belt.  Is there such thing as a cooling conveyor belt?  Wait staff was personable and attentive.  We would love to come back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them more stars. I really love revolving sushi, well sushi in general, but Teharu and Sushi Station (my favorite) are better.  What I will give them is 1 point because it's revolving sushi and 1 point because it's clean and modern inside. (Still Teharu, repaint that poop colored wall - Seriously).  Not bad, not great. 2.5 Stars realistically."}
{"text":"Went in last night not busy at all. Not a lot of options. Service was slow. Requested two rolls that were given to someone else by mistake because they forgot who ordered them :( would have eaten more if there were more selections. We've been here many times and usually good service and lots of variety. This time was a total disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Ahi, your food, it lacks, quality, freshness and pizzaz.  First concentrate on the quality and freshness, the rest will come naturally.  You have hired some of the most darling waitresses and your Groupon was pretty awesome. Even the dining area was clean as a whistle.  But I just can't go back, even if my daughter begs me, again.   The East Valley really needs Kaiten stylei because it's fun and who doesn't like food slowly moving by, tempting us to try something new? Ahi, I hope this place will be you someday! I really do!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to say that these guys are amazing. Stopped in just before closing time, and they made it clear we were welcome. They made us fresh food, to order, and didn't act like we were imposing on them whatsoever. Their food is always fresh and well prepared, but to stay after closing time a day take care of us the way they did, was sure the extra mile. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you want the experience of \"revolving\" sushi then this the place. If you don't mind over priced, subpar sushi on that conveyor belt that is. The whole experience in my book was somewhat distracting . The service was absolutely terrible. The waiter was not friendly and was not knowledgeable of the sushi.   Overall good for a one time experience but we won't go back.  I'll forgo the conveyor belt for better sushi and a better atmosphere any time!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few other revolving sushi bars and I will have to say this place has a lot to learn about doing business. It took about 15 mins just to get our drink order (water) and the place wasn't to busy. The selection of food on the belt was very slim and looked as if it been sitting fir a while. I was a little unhappy after I found out it was cheaper to purchase the gyoza from the menu then (6pcs for 2.00, instead of 3 pcs for the grand opening every plate 2.00 off the belt).   I tried the mango shrimp roll and the mango wasn't even ripe.  We had a lot of uneaten food as the taste and quality was poor. I know for sure I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just wandered in and we were pleasantly surprised! I'm a waitress and I felt the service was a little slow, foods temperature was a little off but had great flavor! Loved that we could try multiple different things! Cheap and yummy date night. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price! I recommend to those who are looking for a quick sushi craving solution."}
