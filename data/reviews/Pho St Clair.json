{"text":"Never had a complaint here, just good Vietnamese food

Quite a small dining area so be ready to drool watching others eat if you go on a busy night"}
{"text":"Nice spot if you are craving Pho and live in the St. Clair area. Small place but pleasant."}
{"text":"Place has been renovated since the last time I was here along with a name change. Must say I'm disappointed with the food and I'm not even picky. Hoisin sauce tastes watered down and Pho selection is very limited. Pho itself was also very mediocre, at best. Rice rolls felt lacking. The price for everything also went up."}
{"text":"My favourite pho and bun(noodles with stuff on top) place! The owner is super friendly, service is fast, food is really good. My favourite is the 319. 
And the kids love the chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"Food pretty good, a tad pricey for a pho place, and washroom wasn't very clean.

Stopped over at this venue with m'lady to grab a bite to eat for lunch. We're avid fans of pho, so we figured we'd try a new place as we were driving by.

It was the typical \"pho experience\" where you write down your order and they bring it to you after collecting your order, so that was all fine and dandy.

The quality of the food was decent, so it was alright for a pho place in that respect.

I found the washroom to be rather dirty, so keep that in mind if you're a paying customer who needs to use it (there's a sign that the washroom's only for customers, so keep that in mind ;-)   ).

Also remember to bring cash with you at this venue, as they're a \"cash-only\" joint.

All-in-all, this place was OK. Not my top choice for pho, but if you feel like pho and you're in the area, it will do."}
{"text":"New ownership has taken Pho St Clair sharply downhill. Grilled pork vermicelli was a plate of noodles - nothin else - and a bowl of meat in what I'm going to call hot water. Spring rolls were gross. The former owner was weird and a bit crabby in a super friendly way, but there's no comparison in the food. Never going back."}
{"text":"Twas a sunny weekend and Manchester United had just won and following a beer I had a craving once again for Pho! 

I imagine myself becoming a Pho connoisseur since I need a Pho injection every week.

Anyway it was late afternoon when I walked past this place and from the outside it looks deceivingly larger than it actually is inside. Maybe that was just the beer :S

Inside it has the usual casual dining vibe, although it is not massive it is adequate. 

First I would just like to say I hate wonky tables! I am not the queen and I like to put my elbows on the table. Note to the owner check your tables and replace or sort out the ones that are wonky!

Okay to the food, ordered a small pho dish, just with beef as I was feeling particularly carnivorous. Dish was with me in 5 minutes and it looked great although the soup was rather more transparent than I am used to. 

BUT - the soup itself tasted amazing a few sips and I was hooked but BOOO not enough Beef in my dish!
It was at this point it dawned on me that I could never give Pho a bad review. That any time I review a place following a Pho craving it would be on the actual restaurant and not the Pho itself as things must be seriously bad to get a simple but tasty dish wrong.

On arrival the place had a couple already there but during my 20 minutes or so there quite a few people came in to collect takeaway orders. 

So okay good points was the soup was amazing, service was quick.

Bad points was the wonky table, not enough beef and was more expensive than my previous experience for the same size yet did not fill me up as much."}
{"text":"Not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but thoroughly enjoyable.

This is my second time having their pho, and neither time was I that impressed. I think this may be a regular place for everything else, though!  The shrimp salad rolls were pretty good, though I did notice that they didn't have basil in them. What really stuck out was the pork fried rice. It has got to be the best fried rice I ever had. The flavour was strong in a good way and there was a very generous amount of shrimp. 

The service was very lacklustre, I felt as if we were almost inconveniencing the server by beng there. That aside, the place deserves some checking out, just for their non-pho dishes."}
{"text":"Big bowls of inexpensive, tasty Pho!  What's not to love?  The atmosphere is cheap-and-cheerful, the lichee smoothies are delicious, and in proper Vietnamese style, they never rush you out the door - payment at the bar only."}
{"text":"It's alright Pho. But the thing that really gets me down are the portion sizes. Pho is so cost effective to make, that the \"Large\" of this chain was the \"small\" for another. I'd be fine with it if the ingredients and quality of the meal was top notch, but it was average at best."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place, but hoped it might be one of the dives that turn out to be a gem.

The chicken pho (white meat, clear broth) that Joanne Kates recommends on old review taped to the window has become a favourite with all whom I have brought there.

I *love* the spring rolls; mostly minced pork and shredded carrot with just the right amount of garlic... on the more side!

The dining room is quite small, so you will have to put up with the blender sound if a shake is ordered.

The service is typical Vietnamese...  3.5 stars.  Open until 9pm.

[Based on 6+ visits, mostly early weekend dinners]"}
{"text":"Food is good and inexpensive. The restaurant was absolutely empty when I went there for lunch, and the lady who \"served\" me kept reading her newspaper during my meal. I can't say I felt comfortable, and I even had to ask if the restaurant was really opened. 

I tried to sit on the counter, but the owner didn't let me. I had to go to a table, even being alone in a empty restaurant. 

I had a nice noodle dish, but nothing incredible. 

A large note on the counter says \"CASH ONLY\". 

At least the dishes are well served and cheap."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, reliable - a mainstay of local residents for years.  Always good.  Seating is really for in-and-out eaters, not for the socializing types.  No debit though, IIRC."}
