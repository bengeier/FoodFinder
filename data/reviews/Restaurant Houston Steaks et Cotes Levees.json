{"text":"This place is something else.

Half the staff are OK, other seem like they care about nothing at all. Food wise, they just really don't know how to cook stuff for the general public. Burger by default is well done, so make sure to specify beforehand.

Fries came dashed on the side with BBQ sauce, just sloppy. First time I've ever had a warm salad (clearly they put it too close to the kitchen heat for a while).

Starving? Sure, it will fill you up. But needs new or at least involved management to get this place to glory.. it's not too late. Staff seem even unhappy with each other sometimes. And the floor can be sticky under the table.. plastic glasses don't belong in a upscale-looking place either.. kinda strange."}
{"text":"We waited half hour to order, and half hour for a chicken caesar, and steak-ish sandwich, both only ok. Not crowded. No excuses. Fortunately, we weren't in a hurry. If you are, skip it."}
{"text":"First, I was told the steak sandwich was not available, then it was available so I went ahead and ordered it.  It was terrible.  The bread and tomato were fresh, but the \"steak\" was a moist, sticky, and tasteless paste of indeterminate protein.

I sent it back and ordered the Houston burger which was better, but not great considering the delicious ingredients.  Part of the problem was a burger they had to cook well done (because, Canada), but still a poor showing.

Terrible selection of beers for a restaurant with a full bar.

The service was actually pretty great.  Our waitress was nice, polite, understanding, and fully intent on making our visit a pleasant one despite the circumstances. 

I would not ever go back here, though, because it is a waste of money overall."}
{"text":"Only place near my gate that had nice place to sit (other takeout places close buy had a few tables nearby that are first come, first served). Was not too busy on a Monday at 12:30 pm. Had the crunchy chicken taco (3 pcs with choice of salad or fries) which was supposedly a Houston special. The chicken was not crunchy at all. Had a reddish breading that reminds me of General Tao's chicken. I found it a bit salty but otherwise just ok food. Had a glass of chardonnay and wished it was chillier. Next time, I would try the other takeout places nearby."}
{"text":"Food is ok, there is no lots of others place for lunch.. staff is lazy and arenot customer oriented.
Well just good because you have almost no choice."}
{"text":"Go for beer. Nice staff. Just don't eat anything. Terrible food. Cold. Not edible. 
Had to send it back
Should have looked at yelp prior."}
{"text":"Food was barely passable and grossly overpriced. Decor is that of a nice fast-food restaurant. Servers are remarkably poor, uninterested and ridiculously slow, especially in an airport! The delis available just 50 ft away are a vastly superior option."}
{"text":"Terrible service, probably the worst I have ever experienced. I actually saw a patron next to me get his bill before his food arrived. All he had was a glass of water!  His face was priceless!  If you must eat here, make sure you have plenty of time. 
As for the food? Okay."}
{"text":"The filet i had was overcooked from what i ordered. It had too much seasoning. I found it funny that it had \"montreal steak seasoning\". The same one i put on my steaks at home. It was too much and it came out tasting salty. The vegetables were extremely soft and soggy. For the price of the food, you def feel like your paying to much for what they serve."}
{"text":"Hostess was accommodating of my request for a larger table and the waiter was very nice but the food was not good. I  have a Plain Jane palate but literally nothing had any taste. Shrimp cocktail...no taste. Burger...no taste.  Fries...no taste. Even the bacon on the burger barely had any flavor. I know it's an airport restaurant but for the prices charged by airport restaurants we should at least be able to enjoy some of the meal. 

On the positive side, it is relatively spacious and comfortable so a good place for drinks but recommend avoiding the food."}
{"text":"This is the worst Houston's I ate in. The service was pathetic!  The hostess was rude and impatient. She was doing us a favor. We ordered burgers. They were really bad. Hated paying a $100 bucks for a bad meal! Even the Diet Coke was flat!"}
{"text":"Don't expect much.  Keep in mind it's in an airport.  They bartender was nice and service was quick but the food was average at best....but if you have a couple hours to kill it works fine."}
{"text":"Went there to grab a bite to eat.  We missed the breakfast menu by about 5 minutes and were  told there was no way to get 2 eggs over easy  and toast.  So at 10:35am we ordered  mini burgers and a club sandwich. It took about 30 minutes to get our food when the place  was only half full. The club was average,  the salad it came with was wilted.  The mini burgers were hard, cold and clearly  had been from the night before.  Very disapointing.  It's not the waiters fault and we could clearly see he was apologetic.  We will  probably not go back there."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. I tried the pulled chicken sandwich and it's easily the worst sandwich I've had on the planet. Didn't even eat the fries as they looked so unappealing. They make the food in the airline look gourmet."}
{"text":"I come here often. Food isn't bad for airport food but management needs to help their servers. They are so nice and work so hard but too many times I have waited 10-20 minutes to find they didn't have what I ordered. Most times I have to skip lunch because I have to catch a flight...."}
{"text":"Tried this place when at the airport since it looked good.  Service was slow and took a while for the server to acknowledge me.  Tried the Poutine but it was drowned in gravy that tasted cheap.  Definitely not up to speed with others that I've tried. Didn't try any other dishes so basing my \"OK' review on the Poutine."}
{"text":"This is bad even for airport food. Very long wait, very expensive prices, very bad food. It's the perfect storm of bad restaurant experiences. Stay away!"}
{"text":"There is nothing of the Houston restaurant experience you are accustomed to in town at this airport's US departures location at YUL.  The staff are curt, \"you order-we serve\" and the menu is overpriced for the quality of food.

I ordered the grilled chicken salad and about thirty minutes of a long wait later, I got a plate filled with arugula, a shake of Parmesan and four strips of chicken for $17.99; quite the rip-off.

I'm in a hurry to take the flight and won't remember much of this place; not worth anyone's time."}
{"text":"The food was good, service though isn't the quickest.  I had the ham omelette which was good: ham wasn't too salty, onion and tomato tasted fresh and eggs was decent.  It came with some potatoes, toast, 2 pieces of fruit and a small bowl of beans.  Didn't eat the beans as I usually don't eat it for breakfast.   

All in all, something before the flight."}
{"text":"Very disorganized!  Took forever to be seated. Then had to ask for utensils. Then another long wait until we were greeted; so, I made sure we ordered at that time. Surprisingly, the food was served fairly rapidly - Breakfast. It is hard to screw that up. My coffee was served sans cream or sugar. Luckily I take it black. Our server ignore us until I asked for asked for a coffee refill and additional jelly. The place was not that busy. Oh yeah, the rotund guys seating everyone and busing the tables dropped his cleaning cloth on the floor and THEN USED IT TO WIPE DOWN MORE TABLES."}
{"text":"The most important thing to note about this restaurant is that the service is not good nor quick.  As others have noted, make sure you have ample time before your flight.  If you do, this is a great place to relax while you're waiting for your connection.   

Food quality is not great.   I chose this restaurant over Burger King and actually regretted my decision afterwards.  Pluses are: the good atmosphere of the restaurant and the cold beer, which helps, especially when your plane is delayed by a few hours due to weather.  

Overall. I rate this two stars based on the service and the food."}
{"text":"This was not good. Rubbery calamari with cream cheese and a tiny dry burger. Not to mention it took 40 minutes to prepare this $50 delight. Go get sushi to go and a beer at the bar down the hall..."}
{"text":"Outdated overpriced menu ...could find anything interesting that would be healthy... After trying TWICE to get the attention of the server, I decided to walk out elsewhere."}
{"text":"My flight was delayed and I took the time to have a little dinner. It's an airport restaurant so. My expectations were low. I ordered the sliders which come with a side of sweet potato fries. I also had a glass of the Pinot Noir.

These sandwiches reminded me of grade school burger day,  dry and really tasteless. The fries were unremarkable. The wine was okay. Staff was flat. The chairs were comfortable. 

Bottom line:  Dig deep down into your bag and find that granola bar you've been avoiding. There is nothing for you here."}
{"text":"Food was just bad  - soggy,  almost cold vegetables and fries served with mediocre steak.   Only virtue is that I think it's the only sit down restaurant after you clear US customs in Montreal.  Would have sent it back in a normal restaurant,  but cut really take the time when you have to run and catch a flight."}
{"text":"Ordered mushrooms on burger and fries, it arrived about 60 seconds later, Luke warm with cheese unmelted.  Meat so tough the knife could hardly cut it.  Sent it back for an order that was hot, got it but totally disgusting soggy fries and meat like a piece of leather.  Had it with a tomato  juice.  Came to $30 with tip!  The worst I've had at an airport and that's saying something.  Macdonald a would have been better."}
{"text":"It is extremely frustrating for a customer when there is a massive line up of people waiting for a table and many empty tables ready to go with no one being seated and a hostess that doesn't seem to know whats going on. I hope someone from management reviews these comments. These people are all trying to grab a bite to eat at your restaurant before catching their flight and many are walking away frustrated and hungry because the staff are incompetent...translates to a huge amount of lost $$$ for you."}
{"text":"By far the worst value for a breakfast.  Complete rip off!  Ordered 2 eggs over easy without meat and it came with toast and potatoes. It was an absolute no frills meal... basic as they come.  The bill was $18.71 plus tip... coffee was an extra charge!  Avoid at all costs... there are other plenty of other options at the airport.... explore them!"}
{"text":"The other reviews have pretty much crystallized my thoughts. Skip the fancy food on the menu, this place is only good for a beer and some bar food. Service at the bar was average, I was offered beverages promptly but it took a really long time to get an order of calamari (which was a tiny serving), maybe that's a ploy to get me to order another beer :)

I didn't see many other decent options at YUL, but this passed the time."}
{"text":"This airport has few choices and we decided upon this location as they were busy but there was no wait.  We were seated quickly but then it took forever for anyone to approach us regards our order.  Good thing we had the time waiting on our flight as the service continued to be very slow and forget needing a drink refill.  The lettuce on the burger was 25% brown, fries cold and bun stale.  Not impressed with the food nor the service.  The airport needs other choices as I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"If there was a 0 stars option I would do that. I ordered pad thai and it was not even remotely close to pad thai. They need to take it off the menu. I basically got a ball of angel hair pasta that had 3 pieces of broccoli, tofu and some egg with some kind of a coconut sauce. No flavor whatsoever. I was starving and I have a fligjt to catch so I did not have the option of sending it back. My server is not the best either. He forgot to give me silverware and never once came by to ask if I needed anything. I also didnt enjoy watching him pick his teeth with a toothpick by the bar that is directly in front of me. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"OK place to grab something and use table as your work desk till your boarding time.  Food portion is good but don't expect anything more. Burger buns are dry and fries are luke-warm...   No cocktail menu so we asked simple martini and it was 19 CAD!! What a ripe-off! 

Nacho might be the best value item. My club sandwich came with chicken salad.. 
If you choose, sweet potato fries, you get half portion of the regular fries.

Service is good."}
{"text":"This is an ok place to eat if you've got time to kill at YUL before a flight.  I wouldn't eat here if you don't have at least 45 minutes to spend.  

I've had breakfast and dinner here.  Both times service was pretty good.  Breakfast was bland and not the best.  Dinner was a bit better, I had the onion soup which was very good, and the salmon burger with salad which was not bad.  Prices are on the higher end for restaurants at the airport."}
{"text":"Poor service, fair food and airport ambience. 
Houstons was recommended by the ticketing agent. The place was packed when we arrived, necessitating a 5- to 10-minute wait to be seated (luckily, we were not in a hurry). After a semi-reasonable wait our server arrived, but the drinks didn't come in a reasonable time. 
Our appetizer was calamari, the best part of our dining exerience and the chardonnay from California was nice and buttery. Our entrees arrived 2 minutes into our appetizer; the server mumbled that it was the kitchen's fault, served it anyway, and apologized repeatedly. 
We thought our food could be worse. My ribs tasted like it was water infused and the fries had good taste, the \"seasonal side\" never arrived. The salmon was slightly over-cooked and rice was \"ehhh.\" Broccoli and green beans were al dente--good!
Due to the full house (we suppose), our service was lacking. Our water was never refilled, the waiter never checked in,  and it took forever to pay our bill.
My advice--consider a different place to eat if there's a line (we were there at 3pm on  Monday). If you eat here, ask for your check when the meal arrives."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveller to Montreal for business, I usually stop for a glass of wine at the bar. The bartender Giovanni is awesome;  he always remembers me and my drink of choice, gives excellent customer service and makes me feel welcome. The food is hit or miss here, and he is always honest and helpful with recommendations."}
{"text":"My gf and I were waiting at host station for a table. Dude behind us gets attention first and seated first. I ask why and they just stare at me blankly. They have a problem here and I think it can go without saying what it is."}
{"text":"I graded this on its airport food. If outside the airport the stats would have fallen. We ordered the poutine and the steak sandwich. They were ok. Decent for airplane food."}
{"text":"Solid food, tons of outlets, quick seating. 
I had the tuna tacos this time. The tuna and spicy mayo were great. The caviar looked like little raspberries and blackberries on top. They popped in every bite, which was quite interesting. I don't think I'll ever like pureed avocado. Side salad was fine."}
{"text":"Houston? Steak? That sounds like it would be an excellent experience ... Negative ...

Ordered a bloody Mary, nasty

Ordered steak sandwich... Dear Lord, I don't think they know what a steak is!. What I got looked like cat food between two buns dripping with excessive amounts of grease, seasoned with Taco Bell spices.

$18 sandwich.. You can have the same experience at Taco Bell for $1"}
{"text":"I always stop at this restaurant when flying to the US.   The Salmon is great!    also a very good spot for breakfast for those early morning flights.   Service is quick, so if you only have 30 minutes, no worries."}
{"text":"I just don't like the service.....and also the food was not really fresh....I just pass here for a little break...."}
{"text":"If you happen to be unfortunate enough to be delayed several hours at Montreal airport and begin to feel hungry, you will find yourself in a predicament of epic proportions - a wasteland of bad food options.

This steakhouse, to my dismay, is no different.

Because I categorize airport food into two categories: sub-par but edible and sub-par knowing my little cousin could make something better.

I'd say this place falls somewhere in between those two categories. With dry meat, flavorless chicken, and undercooked fries being the highlights of the menu, there really isn't much else to write about."}
{"text":"I am going to be blunt... the food I had here was terrible. It took 20 minutes to prepare a 'hot' sandwich, that finally came to the table nearly cold and missing parts of what it was to be served with. The sad thing is there aren't many options in this area of the airport. The experience was so bad they didn't bother charging me for the order. This location is part of a chain and I assume this means either the entire chain makes bad food or this location is an embarrassment to the group it's apart of. I would give it half a star if it were possible. I didn't have a drink... that may be all this is good for. But I exhort everyone passing through the airport to avoid dining here."}
{"text":"adding to the venom - only went here because air canada gave me a voucher - after waiting 20 minutes for my server I just bailed"}
{"text":"The worst of the worst when it comes to airport food.  Overpriced, bland and overall terrible.  I had the prime rib sandwich with fries.  The fries were not crisp and the sandwich was soggy and soaked with the au ju which wasn't very good anyway.  If you can't get fries right then there is no redeeming quality to the restaurant.  My traveling companion said her burger was ok but I have to say that my sandwich was one of the blandest sorriest excuse for \"prime rib\" I have ever had the misfortune to put in my mouth.  

The only reason this place gets one star is because it's not possible to give them lower rating.  If you value your tastebuds at all don't eat here.  Get a bagel or cake from Starbucks.  Your future self will thank your past self for it."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this if you're in a rush. Very slow service. We waited over 30 minutes for eggs and the people next to us had to leave before their food arrived because they were going to miss their flight. Also, warning: the omelet are made from a pre-mixed egg formula and are completely disgusting. We sent ours back. All in all, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Usually cold ham is served on a sandwich, cold eggs are served hard boiled, cold bacon is served on a BLT and cold buttered toast is not served at all. 

But at this pathetic excuse for an eatery they'll arrange them all on a plate, make you wait 40 minutes for them and then charge you $20 for it. 

Shame on me for eating at an airport. Shame on this crap \"restaurant\" for being even worse than the average terrible airport food."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

Really slow service even with their call system on the table which could have potentially been a good idea.

Food was underwhelming and def overpriced. Granted it's airport food which is always overpriced but you expect at least decent food. 

The sticky chicken was salty and sauced over until the chicken was super soggy. The Houston burger was okay. We came here cause I was starving and we were desperate for something to eat close to our gate. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and try another restaurant."}
{"text":"good location in the airport but the food was sub par.... not houstons like the hillstone chain..."}
{"text":"The venue was fine for an airport, service was fairly quickly however the food was not great. I had a veggie omelette, nothing was mixed in except for a lot of cheese, it was very oily and didn't taste that great. It was also pricy for what it was."}
{"text":"The worst service I have had in a very long time. All the food was cold, repeatedly asked for a refill on the coffee and it never came, took 15 minutes to finally bring the check,recommend that you go anyplace but here."}
{"text":"Awful burger that was overpriced and took forever. It was overcooked, dry as a bone, and not even warm. The beef had that characteristic livery flavor of cheap meat, and a strange bitter crust on it. Service was pretty much nonexistent.
We saw servers, but all they seemed to do was hang out at the wait station. They certainly weren't coming by our table. I really wish I had read the other reviews of this place before coming here.

To be fair, the waitress did comp the meal even after we ate the burger (which we only did because we were starving)."}
{"text":"Located past the security checkpoint and close to the departure gates, it's a nice place to sit down and have a meal or a few drinks while killing time to board your flight."}
{"text":"This review is in line with all the others who have had the misfortune of eating here.
My potatoes were cold, the \"veg omelette with spinach & sun dried tomatoes\" was a plain omelette with a few spinach leaves and about 10 microscopic pieces of sun dried tomatoes hurriedly thrown on top.

Unfortunately there aren't too many eating choices in this part of the airport ... at least you've been warned!"}
{"text":"All you can expect for airport food. The service is fast and the place is located very close to the gates. I had a the breakfast sandwich which came with a delicious potatoes as side."}
{"text":"Overall a good place to stop for a bite while waiting for a flight into the US.  I've been here twice, once ordering a burger and once getting a sandwich.  There isn't a whole lot to say about a restaurant in an airport terminal that I assume is part of a chain (I don't know for sure, but it certainly does have that feeling of \"decorated by corporate committee\"), yet the food was good and the turnaround was quick enough that it won't leave you sweating your departure time.  Service sometimes seems to be a free-for-all.  On my second visit a waitress took my order, someone else dropped off my food, another guy refilled my water, the manager took my credit card, either the food guy or the water guy gave me the receipt, and the waitress said goodbye as I left."}
{"text":"Food was almost inedible... ordered the Californian salad and the greens were wilted and the dressing was disgusting (also, I was starving coming into this restaurant, and I'll eat almost anything when I'm hungry... well I could NOT eat this salad). Other food at the table was mediocre at best. In addition to terrible food, service was poor. Our waitress never came around to check in, took 40+ minutes for food to come, and all meals came at different times."}
{"text":"Pleasant ambiance, friendly service, very slow food preparation, mediocre-to-barely adequate food. The usual high airport pricing; roughly 50% higher than outside the airport."}
{"text":"Our group ordered sticky chicken, chicken tenders, and a salad. Took over 40 minutes for the food to come out!  This is an airport? and people expect for food to arrive in a timely manner. 

Our plane was boarding so we asked for our food to go. By the time we rushed to our gate, we realized they did not include utensils or napkins.  Food ended up tasting terrible. I should have done my yelp research beforehand, listened to the other reviews, and stayed away at all costs.

If I could take away stars, I would but unfortunately yelp will not allow me to rate less than 1 star."}
{"text":"Had bacon and egg breakfast before a crack of dawn 6:00 AM flight as this was the only breakfast place (other than fast food) that seemed to be open.  Breakfast was so- so.  Bacon didn't taste as fresh and came with your usual potatoes.  We sat at the bar and service was quick and attentive.  Would I come back here?  I would try other options as it wasn't anything memorable!"}
{"text":"dont do it omg its so bad service is terrible food is the worst run for your life...and probably to the toilet if you went through with it."}
{"text":"Traveling with three other colleagues and we all had roughly 18:00 departure times affording us some dinner time since there is no meals on our respective flights home.  There are a few places to chow down but this one had real seating unlike the fast food type cafeteria sitting.  As usual airport sit down restaurants are not the fasters due to the number of diners and their carry on luggage.

Our servicer was maxed and tough to get his attention and no doubt he was worked to the max.  I had the steak with some brown gravy and fries.  Cooked to medium rare as I asked, it was pretty tasty especially since this trip I didn't have any steaks.  

Overall I think if they had more servers and our poor server didn't have to jump from table to table I think service would have been more than fine.  We ended with ordering their 3 small slice cheesecake plate which was as expected good enough to satisfy the sweet tooth in all of us.

If I am back in Montreal and hungry before departure, I will give them another try hoping that staffing issues will be resolved."}
{"text":"There are so many reviews on how the service is extremely slow here, but that wasn't our experience. They might have responded to these concerns by putting fast service buttons at the tables but we didn't even have to use it. You would clearly expect a decent bite at a relatively fast speed at an airport gate restaurant and I would say this place delivers on both terms. Everything we ordered, the chicken club sandwich, the lobster tacos, and chicken tenders came out exactly we imagined and our server was very attentive. Their sweet potato fries were nicely battered and crispy. Good selection of beer. A nice last minute bite in Canada before you are back in the US."}
{"text":"\"Dude, it in is an airport\"

Don't expect anything too great BECAUSE this restaurant is in an airport!!!! One shouldn't expect a 4/5 star experience. One should expect to eat edible food, to drink a decent drink or three (depending when your flight is departing), and to read which ever random magazine. Oh, you can read the lips of some morning shows from the U.S.  

I ordered some eggs over easy with bacon and potatoes. Was it the best breakfast I had - No. Was it the worst - No. It was simple food for a small-moderatly sized airport. The service was fast and friendly. I will say that the prices are a little steep but that is the case in many airport restaurants."}
{"text":"Can somebody please shut this place down? The only reason they are still in business is because it is the only restaurant in the terminal. The front staff need training in customer service. Words like 'Thank you' or 'You're Welcome' are not in their vocabulary. Not to mention they cut off customers when they are trying to walk by. The food was absolutely horrible and the service as well. If you are hungry or need to kill time do yourself a favour and find somewhere else to spend your time and money."}
{"text":"When you're the only restaurant in the terminal, you simply don't need to give a flying f*ck about quality. And at Houston that's their modo! Overpriced frozen dog feces on a plate. Go to the grab and go counters for decent food. 

we ordered the steak sandwich and the chicken salad club. Both \"meats\" resembled what you'd get in a pre-made, week old, gas station sandwich. The poor guy next to us ordered their $55 \"steak\". Don't think he was too happy when it arrived and looked like it came from a Hungry Man TV dinner meal pack. 

Avoid like the plague, simply not worth it."}
{"text":"Bon arrêt pour s'asseoir manger une bonne bouffe.  Le menu est simple et le personnel, avenant.  Bon ... p'tit mot en passant ai la direction  du resto. Si vous lisez les \"yelp comments\". Ben faut que je vous dise que j'suis pas rendu encore à bouffer des insectes... Fais que les \"fruit flies\" (ou en tous les cas, les p'tites bebittes qui volent au dessus de ton assiette. C'est exotique, croyez moi, ce n'est pas nécessaire.  

Bon. Revenons à la bouffe.  Rib steak sandwich (choix de salade ou de frites).  Ben oui, vous l'aurez deviné, m'sieu a pris lee frites (yer sir). Bières \"on tap\" locales. Prix raisonnable en passant. Le barman super sympa et disponible (c'est pas toujours le cas partout).  J'aurais bien voulu essayé la soupe à l'oignon, mais ça sera pour une prochaine fois.  Bon. Pour ceux qui de le demandent, le Houston est à votre droite en sortant de la boutique Hors Taxes! Pis bon voyage à mes amis yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Drink a beer or two, eat some \"bar\" food. If you come here and order a steak or complex entree, that's your fault. That's like ordering Sushi in Bangalore...(You got food poisoning? Hmmmmm, that's weird). 

Their burgers and tap beers will do the trick, then get on the plane and go. Just go."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was overpriced and flavorless.

Chicken tenders: greasy and bland.

Steak & Frites: both bland."}
{"text":"Too slow.  Took them over half an hour to make me a burger.  In the end I gave up and went to board my flight."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Rushed waitresses. Horrible dry food. Cold fries. Tasteless high priced 18 dollar burgers. Coke is undrinkable. Tastes like coke syrup mixed with flat dish water. They should be embarrassed to serve this stuff at such prices. A microwave burger would be much better. Tastes like grade school cafeteria lunch. But worse."}
{"text":"Is there less than a 1 star? If there is, this place gets it. The service sucked, I got my food 40 min after I ordered it and I sent it back. Server threw a place setting at me for no reason. I told the waiter to get me a manager and he flat out ignored me. Perhaps because I didn't speak francoise? Don't know. When I was leaving I said I wanted the meal comped and the waiter looked at me said 'you wanna go?!?! Go!' Then gestured something my way. I ignored it and got on the plane. This place sucked and I'm not stopping with a Yelp recommendation. I'm going full tilt on this place and calling corporate."}
{"text":"Houston Steak house is in the Montreal airport near the duty free stores. For airport food it was pretty decent and relatively fast. I'm not sure why it's called Houston steakhouse, I'm pretty sure Texans would be offended. 

We ordered the poutine and burger. When I first saw the burger I didn't want to try it. It looked like a very processed meat patty, but was surprised by the taste. I think they put a lot of sugar in it. The poutine was HUGE. Definitely not the best poutine in Montreal but decent. 

I'd come back if I was flying through Montreal again. The only word to describe this place is decent. Overall not bad for airport food."}
{"text":"Been to several Houston's before and the experience was always good.   I'm seeing a low rating on this location and not sure if it's all warranted but here goes with my review. 

This was my first time and I went with a simple meal, chicken strips and fries.  It was about 11am and there was no line and I was seated immediately.    The strips were decent but not spectacular for $18.00.  (Not for 1/2 that actually). The Fries were
Decent too but only mildly warm.   

Fortunately, my server was fairly quick so I didn't have long waits and poor service like so many others mentioned but then the place was only 20% full.  

Overall, it was a 3 star experience.  Decent but if your right on cash I would have just went to one of the many delis just 30 seconds away.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite while we waited for our plane. Our waitress was super nice and pretty attentive, but that my be because there were only like 2 other tables eating at that time. It's a pretty spacious place and I didn't feel too cramped like some other airport restaurants.

We shared a salad and steak sandwich. The salad was ok, nothing special. The steak sandwich was really greasy and the meat was low quality. The only thing that was good were the French Fries! 

So... bottom line it's not that great, but it's a place to chill if you have time to waste before your flight. Or you can just go sit at the gate..."}
{"text":"Houston not Houston's like in the States and a very different experience. To be honest, we found the food to be fair. Lots of different options from healthy to unhealthy (poutine!). But the service was very very slow. I mean very very slow. We went at around 5 pm on Sunday with 1.5 hours to go before boarding and they appeared very understaffed. Lots of folks waiting to be seated would give up before even making it into the restaurant. We were proactive and flagged someone down to get seated. Then we fetched our own menus and placed our orders for everything at once. We also asked for our check when we placed our order. I think that without those precautions we may have missed our flight. Perhaps that was just an off night when someone didn't show for a shift but be warned."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like an airport bar? This one is nothing to write home about on a MTL postcard. 

They have two local-ish beers available. Show some pride in your beer culture people?! Rickards White and Red. The red was kicked. So the white it was. Otherwise Coors light ('MERCA!!) and Heineken (Netherlands for those not in the know). Where's the Labatt and Molson Canadian at?!

Rickards White with an orange slice it was. It was ok. Not my favorite white of all time but got the job done. 

I conversed with Canadian and international travelers as I waited for my Poutine (see photo). It was a half ass effort, to be honest. Cheese curds not melted. Not enough gravy. And not enough cheese. The meat on top was akin to not warm enough shaved steak from the steak sandwich I got from the cafeteria in elementary school. The potatoes were potato wedges that might as well have been microwaved. Definitely had potential because the flavors were on but the effort wasn't there. 

If this is your last taste of Canada before leaving the country I would describe it as a sour taste. Take some pride in the food and drink and show us why Montreal is such a great place to visit. 

Conclusion: it's the only real option in the terminal so you should go but don't expect too much. Sigh."}
{"text":"Solid airport restaurant. The prime rib dip sandwich was juicy and tasty, it even came with horseradish. Beer was cold. Prices were comparable to most in the airport and a good sit-down meal option with friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"As others have noted, the prices are high for what you get ($15-25) for burgers and $10-20 for glasses of wine.  The atmosphere was nice if you can snag a booth, more cozy than the sports bar further up the concourse.  The burger was a bit overdone, as were the panko chicken tenders.  BBQ sauce is the sauce of choice.  The wines were of acceptable quality, at least if you are going to pay a high price you get something that is OK."}
{"text":"Utterly disgusting and major disappointment.
Order the Grilled Salmon plate, you get a 5oz overcooked salmon fillet, expired broccoli with a slice of red pepper. The rice could be good, if it had been cooked this month.
Overall, I ate the salmon and went next door to get a great Smoked Meat sandwich which cost me 1/3 of this plate. 
Oh and the beer was pretty awesome.
1/10 since the beer was actually poured in a glass and not on the floor. Otherwise, -5/10"}
{"text":"The food was average but consistent. Have eaten here a few times due to limited sit down options at the airport. The service is very slow. I don't think it is the servers fault but the management. They are under staffed which creates the issue."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. Customer service was good..not great. The food is awful for the price. Take your chances if you want too. Been warned."}
