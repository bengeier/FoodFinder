{"text":"Use to order from here all the time but not anymore. Took them an 1 hour and 50 minutes to deliver from 10 minutes away! They would never give a correct time when I checked on the order and when it did arrive the pepper steak tasted like burnt oil and the pork fried rice was also burnt. Never again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. By far the best and one of the most well known Chinese restaurants in the area. The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 comes from several cold deliveries and difficult communication on the phone with employees. This can be simply solved by stopping and ordering there and waiting the 5 - 10 minutes for the order."}
{"text":"Food tastes and looks like it came out of a tube and the place itself was dirty. Never again."}
{"text":"A solid takeout chinese restaurant with good food, large portions and cheap prices. And they deliver as well. Definitely hit this place up if you want cheap takeout chinese!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, plus they deliver! I've had the wonton soup, orage chicken, Hunan chicken and triple delight. All very tasty and good size portions.   Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We order 1-2 times a month from Green Lake. It always tastes like they just made whatever is delivered. Unlike the pizza delivery drivers Green Lakes drivers actually always find our house and very fast. We always get sweet and sour chicken, chicken Lomein, pork fried rice, egg rolls and crab Rangoon. Always excellent."}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit I eat here way too much but yet again the food was awesome. Now in truth I can't speak for everything but my usuals are the spare ribs with or with out the bone, wonton soup, sweet and sour pork, and the random and various things everyone else I know gets. My friend Cara loves sea food and she loves getting anything with crab from them and the dumplings are soo good! I love getting food here whether we pick up or have it delivered."}
{"text":"Always a good choice for quick chinese food that is very tasty! They always have it ready faster than we can get to the restaurant to pick-up. Generally 10  minutes and the food is ready!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Painesville.  Food is always hot and delicious!  The crab Rangoon's are very good...nicely sized portions also. The staff and drivers are very friendly. We order takeout from Green Lake a couple times a month. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few Chinese restaurants around the Painesville area that everyone in my family enjoyed. We had many standard dished... General Tso's, chicken lo mein, broccoli chicken, egg drop soup, and the egg rolls. We had a coupon that said if we ordered $30 we would get a free Tso's! How can you beat that. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good Chinese place close to home so I tried this restaurant.  The service here is fast, people are friendly.  The actually cook the food, not microwave it like a recent experience I had elsewhere.  Portions are generous and it was really good.  I got chicken and broccoli, my fiancee got cashew chicken.  Both entrees were delicious.  We will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"Really good food been here countless times never had a bad meal only problem I had was getting them to deliver to my work place on time wasted a few lunches trying to wait for them. I absolutely love the mu shu try it its really good. Also the sesimi wantons are good you have to try those."}
