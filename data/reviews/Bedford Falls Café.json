{"text":"I cannot begin to say enough good things about Bedford Falls Cafe. Jennifer was kind enough to help our family during a very difficult time, and we will always be grateful. We were looking for somewhere to hold a luncheon after our mother's funeral service. Jennifer closed the restaurant early so we could have our luncheon. We had a variety of sandwich trays, side dishes and dessert trays. The food was wonderful and the restaurant itself was warm and inviting. They even had games for the children to play. Everyone who attended was extremely complimentary. 

On a recent trip back to Bedford, my sister and I returned to Bedford Falls Cafe. Again, the food was delicious. We also purchased a variety of desserts to take to family members, in addition to treats for ourselves. The pies and tarts were excellent. 

I highly recommend the Bedford Falls Cafe!"}
{"text":"Love this little place.   Everything o. The menu is exceptionally good.   They hand scoop their ice cream and always have a nice selection on desserts on display.  The employees are always happy and smiling.   It's a great experience for all."}
{"text":"Bedford Falls Café is a smalltown coffee shop with a selection of standard breakfast and lunch fare. While the owners are lovely folks, this place has no unique traits and no standout dishes. I was disappointed to find that most items - sausage patties, bread bowls, even some of the sweet baked goods - look and taste as if they come from vendors, especially since these are things that could easily be done from scratch. Even the hot chocolate and coffee seem diluted and not as rich as you would expect (or want). But it does hit the spot if you're in the mood for a simple soup n' sandwich deal.

However, never place a \"for here\" order if you're on a time crunch. The café is very understaffed, and it has often taken a half hour to receive a simple order of eggs and toast. Given the standard one-hour business lunch, I believe this may hurt them in the long haul if they do not hire more people."}
{"text":"Whether it was feeding twenty hard working crew members or just grabbing one of Carmen and Jen's appropriately named Battleship sub sandwiches or tasty flavorful wraps, Bedford Falls Cafe is at the top of my list of cheerful, old fashion customer focused service."}
{"text":"the few times i ordered from here i was greatly disappointed. freezer burned strawberry ice cream, microwaved food and run of the mill breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is rude and disrespectful to key figures of the community.  The few times I have been in there the staff was lackluster and only moderately attentive at best.  Microwaved eggs and bulk bought muffins that claim to be \"fresh\" is not what I look for in a place to eat."}
{"text":"What a great place to go.   Coffee made with fresh ground coffee beans for every cup. If your hungry for breakfast, lunch or dinner there's always something that you'll want to try..  great prices, always fresh food and friendly atmosphere.  Family owned business in beautiful historical downtown Bedford.  Has become the hot spot for coffee night with the girlfriends."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The food wasn't anything crazy but the ice cream was delicious! Definetly come here for ice cream and coffee but go elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"Nice little corner cafe. You can tell it's pretty touristy for Bedford, filled with \"regulars\" who all know each other. My mom and I went for breakfast, she had the traditional plate and I had a steak and egg wrap. Everything was simple and delicious. They also have ice cream, lunch, and little pastries and stuff that we didn't try."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little place! I got the Mediterranean salad and hummus & veggies. Both were really good! And everyone was really friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Really underwhelming flash brewed plastic spigot stored coffee, coffee \"menu\" consists of different syrup and coffee concoctions rather than regional or single origin blends or even fresh roasted beans. The red eye was okay, certainly nothing special, but drinkable. Once witnessed management screaming at kids over phone, weird experience as a patron of a business."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a local spot. We stumbled in on Friday around 7pm to a karaoke night! Everyone seemed to know one another and felt like family (some may have actually been family. It was so intimate they even celebrated the monthly birthdays and sang to a woman with a birthday crown on. Definitely felt like a regular karaoke group that returns each week. Everyone welcomed us, even new people that came in said hello and told us about the karaoke nights and to come back again soon. Despite the closeness of the patrons we didn't feel like an outsider. 

Food: You go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok. The tuna salad was a bit too over dressed for my liking. It felt gluttonous with all the mayonnaise and I think there was mustard in there maybe? It came with a side and I chose coleslaw, it felt kind of like the kind you would buy in a big jar at sam's club, not my favorite but others like their sides so maybe I'll try something else next time. The others liked the chips and the macaroni salad. Chicken salad on the croissant had similar opinions on the tuna that it was thick and over dressed but the croissant was toasted and good.

I would definitely check this place out again, maybe for breakfast next time! I love that they do reward cards for locals to earn free sandwiches and even deliver within a 5 mile radius. I'll update after my next visit."}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem!! Came in for a coffee only to find they have SO many incredible combinations of drinks, and you can customize with so many flavors. Did I mention they are half of the price of a Starbucks coffee, and so much tastier. It was so good we came back yesterday for coffee and had lunch - homemade tuna salad is DELICIOUS, and the staff is so friendly. This is an absolute gem, I can't wait to come when it's warm and enjoy a tea and lunch!! Huge drink menu, even bigger breakfast and lunch menu. Thank you ladies for being so personable & for my favorite new coffee shop!"}
{"text":"This spot has had a lot of names over the years and I've never visited very often. After a recent stop this summer during a small festival in the common area I decided to have lunch here. Huge selection to choose from! I was starving and went straight for the massive USSR subs. I want expecting it to be as big as it was, especially for the price! The bread was possibly the best part, warm and soft and not too thick. You can bet I will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"First time- and last here. Waited and waited and waited for one of the sub sandwiches. 45 minutes later our food arrived, but they forgot our coffees. We even tipped as we paid. Our sub was low quality (bread was dried out, it needed seasoning or sauce too.) I noticed as we were waiting- two other people stood at the counter checking watches and looking frustrated. Horrible service, low quality food. Never again."}
{"text":"Cute local look. Nice people, looks like a family running it. I had Tuna Melt which was very good. My wife and Daughter had breakfast sandwiches and both enjoyed them. They had them on Ciabatta bread which was soft and excellent!  Nice place. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I just love this little corner shop in downtown Bedford!  It is in such a great area near the Bedford Museum and all the other little shops that make up downtown Bedford giving it a classic hometown feel and look that you just can't find in many other places in Ohio!  
     Once you walk in, it's not the biggest place you'll walk into but is clean and nicely put together.  It's about 15 tables (there is even one in the back near the bathrooms that is away from everyone else that looks like people have private meetings and business discussions away from the other tables to ensure privacy).  The whole setup is nice and quite simple at the same time.  The menu is VAST with several different items.  The prices do have a $1-$10 range with a few items possible exceeding that.  I had ordered their special sandwich deal where you pick THREE meats and FIVE toppings with a few other items to choose from (like salad dressing as topping) and I was NOT disappointed!  I received a HUGE sandwich that needed a fork to help consume the extra toppings coming off the sandwich!  No worries, I know some people might not like the LARGE portion but me personally I appreciate getting a good size quantity of food.  It's even a restaurant style setup in this cute little deli/coffee shop because the girl who took our order had delivered us our food and I didn't even know that's the way they cared for the customers!  Very nice Bedford Falls Café!  I was not expecting that pleasant truth! My sub sandwich was tasty and filling!   All of the leftover ingredients (I'm sorry, the sub sandwich was DELICIOUS but I just couldn't finish it!)  So, I took it home and used ALL the leftover ingredients in a wonderful salad.  I am looking forward to visiting here again and if you live in the area or know someone here there are occasional coupons in the mail that can greatly enhance your choices and quantity of food you order.  With or without a coupon, I will be eating here again.  
     I am giving this place 4/5 stars because I feel if it's busy or a lot of people here in the Deli café then it does get loud and you end up waiting for food/service.  Also,  what REALLY bothered me the most here; I was using the women's bathroom and all of a sudden I heard the quickest one-two knock followed by someone messing with the handle and UNLOCKED THE DOOR WHILE I WAS STILL IN THE BATHROOM!  As soon as I heard the one-two knock I replied, \"Someone's in here!\" and as soon as I said that, the key unlocked the door and I saw an employee look right at me and say, \"Oooh! Sorry!\".  Well, the door was locked for a reason and don't just unlock it WITHOUT waiting for a response!  I did not appreciate that!  Luckily I was washing my hands (how did this girl not hear the water running??) and not on the toilet or else I would have gone to whoever was in charge.  
     Overall, a pleasant experience with the food and dining room aside from the bathroom incident.  I look forward to trying something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here to eat lunch and catch up with a friend. It's very quaint and in a pleasant location.  The food was delicious, but I wouldn't go here for dinner due to the limited menu. Service was fast and very friendly. I would definitely go here again."}
