{"text":"Same story every time I come to this place. ZERO service. I have not seen such disorganization before! Hard to distinguish serving staff from patrons. There seemed to be a number of people working but effectively avoiding it. A good 15 min until a server approached our table. Order was taken. 15 to 20 min passed before beers arrived - brought by a different server. Second round took longer - no server follow up. Order finally taken and delivered by a different server. Again, the wait to place the order and have it delivered was inordinately long. Schanks is a big space, but it was not busy for a Monday evening. Then the biggest fiasco to pay for four beers with cash. No one had change. Laughable watching the server trying to break a 20. This process took another 20 min. Unreal. Absolutely unreal."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite place to go in Calgary. I always get dragged here because of the novelty of the mini golf/ bowling etc but have never and I mean never had acceptable service. 
All the servers here stand at the bar, talk and txt, generally seeming as if they have no idea why u are there or what u could possibly want. I have even gone back into the kitchen to request a fork after waiting 15 minutes for either ( I asked 2) servers to bring me one.
I have never been to the south location ( too busy to get a table when I was there) I hope it's better. 
Seriously if this pub got some half decent  service it could be amazing... But the novelty has seriously worn off."}
{"text":"Quality! OK,  there are plenty of choices in the Crowfoot area and I fell in to the trap of going to your BP's, Brewsters, ie big box choices over the several months.  Had lunch at Schanks today, just to throw a change up, and I was very pleasantly satisfied. This is more than a sports bar, this is a great place to have lunch regardless if there is a big game on or not. Seriously, I have had my fair share of pub grub, and this is a step above in the quality dept. Next time your can't decide, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I was here for a corporate event and had a great time. The place had pool tables, mini golf, some video games and things like that, along with probably nearly 100 tvs big and small, with one really big one. 

It is a good environment, but can be a little loud. Food is priced satisfactorily and tastes pretty good. 

Its a nice place to go for a sports game and can be packed during the big games and dead when no games are playing. 

They have a mini-Olympics which is good for friends, bachelor parties, and work events."}
{"text":"Yawn. good for game night, but not much else. food isn't great. If you want to play mini golf and drink - go here. Otherwise, not much of an attraction."}
{"text":"Cold beer!  When the guys pay golf there we want cold beer.  I have never had cold draught there.  It is time to update your beer system.   Check out the Canadian Brew House or Madison's in Beddington to know what cold beer tastes like.  I am not going to stop  going to Schanks on golf nights but when I  want to go somewhere just for a beer or a night out  with friends then I will  go somewhere else until the beer gets colder ."}
{"text":"Schanks often tends to be where my friends want to meet up on their birthdays. It is a cool place! Bowling, arcade games, mini golf and a virtual driving range. The prices are high, and the waitresses are quite careless. Still, it is worth checking if not just for the environment. I suggest going on a game night!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Thursday.  First time we've met here.  I have been here once before a couple years ago.  Not many people and it is very dark wood and dreary.  But good if you want to be able to have a nice get-together and hear the people.

We were served quickly after sitting.  The beer was a good price.  We had a plate of nachos with extra cheese.   The price was high for what we got.  No meat and little cheese.  I thought the extra cheese must be in the middle of the nachos.  Disbursed evenly?  Nope!  They dumped a bag-o-nachos on the plate.  Dumped the veggies and sprinkled some cheese.  That is it.  To make things worse, the salsa must have been from a no name jar.  It was not good and could have made it better myself at home.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Service was less than average, though I appreciate or server coming to check up on us...multiple times but maybe 5 times too many. Food is a little lack lustre for how bad it is.

My first visit was not here was not great. Our server was rude and very impolite. Food is nothing worth mentioning. 

My second visit here was to watch a hockey game against Calgary's rivalry, Vancouver, and the manager was more than welcoming. Though, I didn't appreciate that our server wasn't happy with the tip we gave her at the end of our meal. I also don't appreciate that she tried to guilt trip us in giving her more. I'll give you what I have but don't ask for more you just come off as rude at that point. 

This place would be 5 times more enjoyable if the food and service were a 5/5 but I rate this a 1/5. 

Atmosphere is great and lively, a huge open space and just an overall great place to watch sports. I recommended eating before coming here to enjoy a game, drinks that are available are average. 

Overall 2/5 stars for you Schanks."}
{"text":"Been here at least 6 times over the last 10 years. Only once in memory did I get great service. This is the reason that I have only been less than once a year. As some have stated extremely slow and inattentive service is the norm, regardless if it is busy or not. I don't really respect a place who has employees that are more interested in standing around and chatting with each other than serving the customers needs. Food is definitely boring and subpar in preparation. Guess the kitchen is run as well as the front of the house in that regard."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this 'sports bar' experience.

Went here on a Saturday night to watch the late HNIC game between the Oilers and Canucks. Immediately it was noticeable how empty the place was... our group was about one of only two or three that were there to watch the hockey game.

The food was decent, and the service was fine. But they weren't putting the sound on for the hockey game. At first I thought it was just an oversight, so I asked, but apparently management won't play the sound for any hockey games that don't involve the Calgary Flames. 

So this is a sports bar, that is showing a game on a gigantic TV, but won't play the sound. Worst still, they insisted on pumping Top-40 music instead, like some dance club. So while trying to watch the game, all you heard was Taylor Swift, Nick Jonas, Justin Bieber, and Selena Gomez.

There are so many sports bars you could go to instead (Buffalo Wild Wings is next door I found out later) that you might as well go to one that takes hosting you seriously."}
{"text":"Well... My Coca Cola was a-ok. I suppose that's pretty hard to mess up. When my margherita pizza came my tune changed regarding this place. It took over an hour to get here(the majority of which I assume was spent sitting out on the counter.) This pizza tastes like cardboard lightly brushed in tomato paste with a couple of mozzarella patches for diversity. When I read \"Mozzarella and our zesty tomato sauce topped with fresh basil and cherry tomatoes\" I expect just that. Usually I'm pretty impressed with Schanks south's food but this is just pathetic. I've had freezer burnt frozen pizza that literally takes this thing, holds it up by its lapels and punches it in the eyes until it's begging for its mommy and daddy (who just happened to be cousins.)"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I came to Schanks with low expectations. Friends had told me that service left a lot to be desired and the food is not very good. It seems like a great place to watch a hockey game, as there are TVs on pretty much every wall. Also, the games themselves are a lot of fun. We played a few rounds of pool and some mini golf, which were pretty entertaining (we played to see who was the best of the worst). But I expected the worst service wise and though it wasn't terrible, it wasn't great either. We sat for almost 15 minutes with no acknowledgement before we gave up and went up to the bar. The bartender didn't seem surprised at all when we said we hadn't seen a server. When we sat down again after playing some games, nobody came by to see if we wanted another round. Off to the bar again for a second time! The place is very big and they clearly either don't have enough staff to keep up or the staff just don't care. It wasn't a horrible experience, as we still had a great time. But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with lots of tv. Waiters can get busy so sometimes it better just to open a tab at the bar. I usually hit up billards but there is an arcade and bowling. Reasonable rates with a sports bar vibe."}
{"text":"3 stars pretty much explains Shanks perfectly.  There is so much potential considering the size of each building, but they don't really take the initiative to make these places a hotspot that I want to go to.  I usually end up going for birthdays or work parties and I usually leave disappointed.  The food is always brutal and they seem to even screw up the fried appys.  There's never any decent drink or food specials and it's pretty expensive to play the games.  Not to mention that those freakin games are always either busted or stealing your tokens.  They're only saving grace, in my opinion, is the abundance of huge TVs make it a good place for Flames games.  Hopefully they make some big changes in order to make Shanks more of a landmark and not just a last resort."}
{"text":"Terrible service. 20 min. Before ordering. 45 min. Before food arrived. Food cold.wont go back."}
{"text":"I will willing drive across the city any time to watch a hockey game or meet friends here. I have never felt like a customer there, feels more like family. Service is always top notch, servers and management have always been good at making a personal connection rather than the typical business/customer relationship. Its a great place to go anytime!"}
{"text":"I give it a one because the review won't let me go any lower. Every single time I've gone, no matter where I sit (unless its directly at or one seat away from the bar) there is never any servers, they are all gathered around their till station at the bar. Not once have I been served a drink, the food has given me food poisoning twice, and anytime any of the server are asked anything it's met with the attitude that they have more important things to do. I'd much rather drive across the city to the north schanks. You at least get treated like customers up there."}
{"text":"How do I start, I have been to decent number of sport bars and places like this, I haven't seen one like this in my life. This place sucks on many levels.

Firstly, the food is as equivalent to dog food and i think most of it is cooked from box mixes, under-seasoned meat and raw flour pizzas are available on the menu. Better have your dinner at home, that will save you few bucks. In addition to this, my cocktail glass was dirty so i have to return my cocktail and the new drink was poorly executed and not even close to the recipe which was on the menu, few drinks should be shaken, adding ice cubes is not the proper way. Stay away from cocktails as far as possible. Their collection of beer is just OK. However, they have better wine collection than i expected. If you have no options, stick with known wine and your fav beer on the menu here. On top of that expect a horrible service.

The main disappointment awaited for me at the bowling spot, this place needs maintenance and a big one. I haven't seen a dirty and broken bowling place like this. The machine was broken and they have to reset it couple of times to get stuffs working. It is in a best spot and have best themes, sooner they wake up they can make more money."}
{"text":"We went to Schanks for a work function and I was ready to be unimpressed, however the food was really decent and the service fairly good. The only time I didn't see a server was when we were doing the games. Even then she found the lot of us and we were served pretty quickly then. Overall it was a fun night!"}
{"text":"Really the service here is awful. I thought previous reviews must have been exaggerated. They aren't. It's horrible."}
{"text":"I haven't been back here in over a year and from my most recent experience I remember why!

A friend and I decided to come here for wings, and was surprised that the parking lot was pretty deserted. We sat ourselves near the bar since it was pretty empty and thought it'd be more convenient for our server. We sat at our table for 20 mins before we could get anyone's attention - the bartenders and servers were all clustered around the bar on their phones and busy chatting with each other to notice we were there.

Once we were able to order food, it took a while for it to come out and when it finally did, the wings were kinda cold. 

We only managed to get one round of drinks and wings in, we figured all the waiting around wasn't worth it so we tried to find our server to get our bill but had no luck. Turns out, she had finished her shift and left without telling us who our new server was!

With the nearby Hudson's soon to be open, a Brewster's, Montana's, and other surrounding restaurants with bars, people have better options to choose from than coming here!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly enthused when I heard our team build was at Schank's (see my review for Schank's North), but after it was over and done with I was pleasantly surprised.

The food \"buffet\" they had for us was pretty decent and the activities (mini golf, billiards, racing on the arcade cars and virtual golf) they set up for us for the afternoon were well organized. 

This location seems better managed and cleaner than the North location by a long shot."}
{"text":"I've been to Schanks several times in the last few years. Considering I'm not one to go to sports bars a ton, that says something.

Here's what I like about Schanks. They have good food, great, organized service and a great atmosphere to hang out in. It's the kind of place that sees everything from corporate groups to die hard sports fans to bachelorette parties on any given night. You can dress up or be casual and still fit in which is awesome. Crazy number of TVs with different sections airing different sports if its a busy sports night.

The other thing I love about Schanks is that they make it easy for charitable organizations to organize fundraising events there. They have a few different programs they offer as well as providing great space for the events to be run in. Schanks is large enough to accommodate big groups while still leaving room for regulars. It is great to see a bar/restaurant doing its part to help out various different community groups make some money. They also know how to support these kind of events from a service perspective, making it  a hassle free night for organizers-much appreciated.
So to recap- good food, great people, a soft side for charity fund raisers and good for a few friends or a giant group. It's a winner all around."}
{"text":"If you've never been to Schanks, picture this. Picture a GIGANTIC space and a would-be sports bar. Then picture inside of this sports-bar like space, a mini golf course, a bowling alley, an arcade, pool tables, and two simulator golf screens. Now add in a few HUUUUUGE television screens and you've got a pretty crystal-clear picture of what a visit to Schanks would entail.

I actually once went to Schanks on a first date. Now THIS was a bad idea because the ENTIRE night, my date was glued to the TV screens rather than to me. I much prefer Schanks as a spot to go with a bunch of friends who all want to have a chillin', easy-going night..

It's usually pretty packed on Friday/Saturday nights, especially on nights when there is a game on. Be forewarned; If you're thinking of heading to Schanks with someone that you want to have a real heart-to-heart conversation with, pick another place. It's likely you'll barely be able to hear every other word.

Schanks is where you go when you just want to have a fun, rowdy night. It's also a fun place on New Year's Eve! Everyone is just there to  hang out. 

The servers are laid back, the crowd is laid back, and there's a slew of fun to be had. Need a night off from the tension of  life? Jump in your car and head to Schanks."}
{"text":"I have been to Schanks South a few times over the years for different events (birthdays, hockey games etc) however this was the first time going to Shanks North and it was for a retirement party.

It was a Friday night, so fairly busy and lively.  This place is huge and has everything from mini golf, bowling, pool tables and of corse big screens to watch sports. after all,it is a sports bar.

We had the back of Shanks booked for the event which was great. A bit quieter and lots of room for all of us (approx 30 adults). We had decorations and a cake brought in as well. 

We had a great waitress who was attentive and we saw quiet often throughout the evening for drink orders. Very important! We didnt each order food since the organizer of the event, pre ordered appetizers for us all and it was set up on a separate table as buffet style. Cold and hot appetizers that were checked on by another employee to make sure items were hot and what needed replenishing. She really did stay on top of the food situation. Lots of food variety and everything was good. Classic food stuff you would find in a pub/sports bar.

Side note - the boneless wings are really good here!

Food and service was good. Plenty of things to do at this location.

It was definitely a great night and experience. Great place to book a social event (birthday,retirement,charity event) since there is  so much to do but also so you can sit back and just hang out."}
{"text":"There is one reason I'm giving this a one star review. This is not related to the food or prices or anything.

I asked if their sausage and bacon was all pork as I have a lot of unusual food allergies, (some being anaphylactic). Her response \"uh I think so\". We explained that I'm anaphylactic and asked that she go check. She came back and said \"yeah it's all pork\". I asked \"the sausage and the bacon are?\". Her response \"...yeah\". She looked at me funny and sounded like she thought I was weird for asking. Now I'm not judging too much on her tone and facial expression here because I don't know for sure that that's how she meant to come across. But still. Then when the food got there it looked kind of light for being all pork so I gave up and didn't eat it. Also she ID'd be after we already ordered. It was breakfast time and I wasn't even drinking."}
{"text":"Tonight we met a couple of friends out for 'wing night', something I have not done since maybe University. I had never heard of it but it was close enough to home and why not? We are always game to try new places.
In we went and it looked like we were going into a movie theatre. I can say that I have never been inside any place like this. It was a bar... but not a normal bar. Old school carpet, large, strange layout and lots of other things offered inside such as betting on the ponies? Bowling?
We seated ourselves and from moment one we had terrific service. Towards the end of the night I even told the server that she was great to our table. I think it is nice for them to hear that now and then when deserved. 
I had a hold of a menu and it seemed rather large. We were there simply for wings though so no analysis required. I liked the several varieties of wings offered. 10 wings came to just over $3.00.  29 cents a wing. Not too shabby.
Our table partook in the BBQ, Teryaki, Medium and Salt and Pepper. No complaints on the wings - they were average. Our friends stated that they had been there once before and they were better then - more saucy and not as well done as they were this evening.
I ordered extra wing sauce on the side and of course we all had drinks. Hubby noted that the beer could have been colder and the server was nice enough to chill his glass prior to serving his beer. The sever also did not even bat an eye when asked if we could split the bill 2 ways. 
The place was nice and dim and not too loud. The crowd was average, I dislike crowded bars so it was perfect. 2 floors, very high celings. 
Not a place to come for a meal on your own or to come for say, a first date.
Nice open space, would be ideal for watching a hockey game.
Not too pricey - for 2 of us, 3 drinks each and 20 wings = $42.
Would return. The service that we had tonight and the company that you come with will make your night!
3 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome places to watch a sporting event! Lots of beers on tap! Wings are decent for wing night but rest of the food and the service is mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"Okay first of all, let's get one thing out of the way.... ATHLETIC CLUB? I spent almost 15 minutes searching on my phone trying to find this place, because it seemed completely illogical that anybody would name a bar/restaurant this way. As a fan of the show 'Bar Rescue' I've seen so many places be scolded for names that included \"Inn\" or \"Cafe\" for misrepresenting what they do... how has nobody asked them what the hell is with \"athletic club\"?

Anyway, that aside...

I came in on a Saturday afternoon with my brother and his girlfriend. It was understandably VERY quiet, and I have to say I was impressed with the decor, cleanliness, quality of the tables, poll equipment, etc. all of that was great.

However, this seems to be another establishment falling short due to the human element.

Our waitress was okay... but just okay. First of all, we didn't see any table service for quite some time, until after we'd made our second trip up to the bar to order for ourselves. It seems like they didn't even know we were there until we ordered food, and finally upon delivering it a waitress finally asked if we wanted another round of drinks. She was okay... but just okay. She asked all the typical questions, but did so in a very \"down to business\" kind of fashion - the initial smile was very forced and was only shown once, and everything else was very quick and abrupt - something I'd expect in a slammed bar that was short on staff - not a place with almost as many staff as customers in the building.

I imagine on a busier time when they're making more rounds this place would be just fine, but on this particular trip I was rather underwhelmed by the staff."}
{"text":"Shanks has three locations- on in Edmonton, one in Calgary north and one in Calgary south. 
This is a very unique bar where you can play games such as pool, mini golf, VLTs, golfing, basketball, etc. 
Shanks has been an integral part of Calgary south for many years as well as Ranchmans because they are so close to each other I thin they feed off of each other for business such as people go for pre-drinks and food at Shanks and then go to Ranchmans for the later part of the evening. Shanks has seen many businesses go from around the area and still they have managed stay. 
Because of the business with the games now that there is the rec room I was afraid that this business would be impacted but then when I think about it- the Rec room is all the way in the north and Shanks is nice in the south for people who do not want to go to the North so I think Shanks will survive. 
I gave them 4 stars out of 5 though because when I went to watch game 4 of the hockey playoffs for the Stanley cup between Vegas Golden Knights and Winnipeg Jets they were doing a draw for a NHL team flag that everyone could enter ballots to win so of course we entered and we won! We went up to get our \"flag\" and the \"flag\" was what ANYONE IN THE WORLD could get for free if you bought a 24 pack of Canadian beers! So that was disappointing and cheap because we already had so many of them. 
However the winning ballots also got put into a draw for a trip for 2 to Vegas for NHL Awards night which would be cool to win! I will keep you posted as to whether I win or not ;)"}
{"text":"REVIEW #5000!

I have worked for the same company for 26+ years and as part of that journey have had the pleasure and privilege of working with some really neat people. A few of them rise to the top as having a real influence, both personally and professionally. Jim M. is one of those people and when he announced his retirement, it was a given that I would make the trip to Calgary from the San Francisco Bay Area to mark the occasion.

Jim chose his retirement celebration to be at the Schanks Sports Grill among his family and a special sampling of his work friends. Actually, retirement is a bit of a misnomer, as he's already working a number of consulting gigs. He's also a new grandfather which will keep him busy, happy, and engaged. 

I arrived early and left near the end. The end was hard to define as old friends flowed from one conversation to the other knowing that this was a special moment that perhaps only closing time could control. I knew many of Jim's friends as well, and was pleased to connect again with Kathy, his Son and Daughter and their significant others. 

So what about Schanks?  The place is huge, with lots of big TVs, plus a miniature golf course, and a e-driving range. A large amount of food was catered, which was tasty, albeit not all that heart healthy. Beer selection was good and plentiful, and I did have my drive back in mind regarding frequency and quantity. Our party was near the front at the side, which included a wall of TVs featuring NBA Basketball (Warriors), NHL Hockey, and Curling. And since Jim is such a sports fan and collector of jerseys, we all had one on for this celebration. It was a very nice space for our group. 

By myself, a visit to Schanks would be a 3-4 Star experience. That's mostly because I'm not a big sports groupie and I find a place of this size to be a bit intimidating. There will also be no Michelin Stars awarded here. This 5 Star Experience reflects a total greater than the sum of its parts, like Wayne Gretzky, or in this case a wonderful retirement party for a wonderful friend and colleague. Let me still grow up a little more to be more like Jim."}
{"text":"Great place for sports esp horse racing
Huge projector screens and high def TV's

Pool tables, miniature golf etc et good pub grub wings can be boneless or regular"}
{"text":"B -  List. Great beer and ambiance. Food is very average - very very. Lots of smokers out front late into the night - Have fun!"}
{"text":"Expect really slow service during flames games or on wing night. They are extremely short staffed during these events. I went with a group of 6 and we waited almost 45 mins for our wings and when they arrived they were cold and hard. We waited over 25 mins to get our drinks. You are better off just walking over to bar and getting your drink yourself. If you go on a slow night this place is like the chucky cheese for adults. You have billiards, bowling, a virtual golf simulator and tons of tv's. I just wish the manager would schedule appropriately for promotional nights."}
{"text":"Shanks been a staple of south Calgary for decades. 

Well it has not changed whole. 

Lots of tv screens with sports. 

Decent pub style menu. Price is good and portions are good size. Pricing is similar to other pubs. 

Staff super friendly.  

Mini golf, billiards, golf simulator and arcade games. 

Highly recommend for sport enthusiasts."}
{"text":"I headed out to Schanks on a Saturday night, Flames night, on a whim. I live in the south end of the city, so I had never been to this location. And probably will never be back.

The bar was incredibly empty, considering it was a game night. However, the home team lost, so we figured that might have something to do with it.

Our server looked like she'd rather be doing anything besides serving our group of 8. She was rather rude, did not clear glasses in a timely manner and did not drop by to see if we needed refills very often. Had it been busier, we could understand - but this was not the case. We found that going up to the bar ourselves yielded much friendlier & quicker service."}
{"text":"Come when it's not busy so you can play pool and sip on some beer. Lets not forget, watching the hockey game!"}
{"text":"We decided to drop by and have a Guinness. Service was good. Beer was horrible. They need to teach the bartender how to pour this elixir of the gods. This is an expensive beer. When you pay top dollar you should get a good pour."}
{"text":"Right off the top I have to admit that I may be a little critical of this location. I've been going here since I was legal and unfortunately it is no where near as solid a place it was when I was younger. The food is decent and the entertainment options are varied, but I haven't been \"wowed\" in over a decade. The service seems to be always slow and hit-and-miss on friendly. If you're down south it's a decent option, but you do have a couple of other sports bar options.
28/30"}
{"text":"The big screen here is a great way to watch the game with your friends. Have some beers, get some pub food, and take in the crown. Its like being at the stadium without the wind, the rain, and the security guards."}
{"text":"I haven't spend a lot of time in Schanks. In fact, it's pretty out of my way to get to.. one way down on Macleod and one way up on Crowchild, those aren't really my stomping grounds. But, we popped in for a friend's bday over the weekend.

First off, if you need room, Schanks has it. It's HUUUUUUGE! And was that a mini golf course I saw on my way in? 

Anyway, I wasn't able to stay the entire night, but long enough for a couple of drinks and an appy platter. Our server was on top of things, over to the table frequently to make sure our drinks were good. The platter took longer than I thought it should've to make it's way to the table. It was an alright platter, I just wasn't entirely impressed with a couple of the wings at the very bottom... a bit soggy.

The only local beer you'll find at Schanks is Big Rock. So don't go for the beer. But, there are pool tables and plenty of TVs. It's not so bad."}
{"text":"Schanks for nothing. I would give it no stars if I could. The service is embarrassing. I was there today and thought it was a joke. It wasn't even crowded and it took forever for a server to come to me. I was by myself and understand that I'm not a huge payoff, but seriously thought I may've been in a hidden camera show. The food was clearly microwaved and definitely overpriced. Not sure if my server was drunk or hungover, but she couldn't care less. Normally I don't comment on places unless I have good things to say. This was such a bad experience, I had to comment. If the staff is gonna do drugs in the back, at least do a better job of covering it up. The layout is nice and there's plenty of TV's so I had some high hopes but I had to go to the bar for a drink and silverware even though I had a server."}
{"text":"Went here for a work party. Food was \"meh\" but it's a sports bar so what can you expect? 

Loud, tv's, mini golf is all cool....but this place NEEDS pinball."}
{"text":"I like Schanks. A lot. I am a sports fan and it's a great sports bar.

The best thing about Schank's is the options: you can watch the game, play a round of mini-golf, shoot some stick, bet on the horses, play arcade games... I like getting up and walking around and doing different stuff. The service is better than most posts might details, and the food is not too bad at all. Great nachos. 

If you are the kinda guy who wants to spend 6 hours on a Sunday betting on Pro-line and watching football, while having a good time, this is the place for you my friend. Tell them I sent you. Not really."}
{"text":"Food was ok... And the wine.... Well.. I have had better.... The place is big and good to watch sports.. They also have a bowling that could be very nice if you would like to play in a quiet place..."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I sat near the bar and heard a waitress complain that she got poor service at a different establishment. My waitress. Pretty poor. Wait staff doesn't seem friendly either. Decided to avoid any food after any of that. I wasn't sure they'd get the order right after paying no attention. They decoded to talk more about their recent drinking excursions than pay attention to any patrons. Second time I've been here since I moved and I thought I'd give it a try. Nothing changed. It must be the culture."}
{"text":"This is a good place to chill out with friends and watch the game.  With larger groups they have lots of pool tables, virtual golf, mini golf, and an arcade to entertain everyone.  This place is HUGE and in recent years they have made a small expansion.  Because of its size you almost never have a problem finding a table except on big event nights like Flames playoff games or UFC fight nights.

The food isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"Yes, Schanks is the ultimate sports bar.  And I don't mean that figuratively.  Okay, most sports bars just play a lot of games on TV and have a lot of jerseys and picture on their walls, but not Schanks.

This place actually has sports that you can play INSIDE the bar.  That's right!  You can choose from virtual golf, mini golf, pool, bowling, off-track betting and even some racing video games.  

However, if you want to play all those things, it's going to cost you.  When I go to Schanks I usually focus on one activity and spend my money on that.  And I usually pick the mini golf.  My favourite thing about the mini golf course is that it actually runs through the entire bar, in and around the tables and people.  It makes it a really fun, interactive game.

The people at Schanks are generally pretty nice, too.  That's probably because everyone is there for the same reason: the love for sports!  It's true that if you're a sports fan, you'll love Schanks.  I'm not even a sports lover and I still love this Schanks location!"}
{"text":"Schanks really is the ultimate sports bar.  They have everything, and I mean everything, a sports lover needs.

Lining the entire back wall is the biggest TV I have ever seen.  It's so big, in fact, that if you're sitting too close you will hurt your neck.  I would almost say it's the equivalent of watching a movie from the front row... and no one likes that.  They have more than enough TV's to occupy the rest of the place too.  It doesn't matter where you're sitting or what direction you're facing, you're going to be able to see the game... and they play a lot of games!

Aside from the TV's, they also have games that you can play.  This includes mini golf, virtual golf, arcade games, billiards and off track betting.  Like I said, it has something for everyone.

I find the prices at Schanks to be a bit too high for me though.  The beer seems a little over-priced, but I suppose they can demand it since they are the only bar of their kind.  Drinks aside, it costs a bit to play the games as well.  I don't think you'd be able to make a day out of the games because you'd have cleaned your wallet out!

It's not my favourite place, but that's because I'm not really a sports lover.  I know many people who only visit Schanks because of how dedicated they are to the place and how much they love it.  Sports fans unite!"}
{"text":"I have been to Schanks South a few times and have always had a pretty good experience, so when some friends suggested we go to Schanks North to watch the hockey game, I figured why not? It was definitely not the same experience. Nearly everything was lousy, from the food (which took almost 45 minutes and tasted like it had sat under a heat lamp for 30 of those), to the service (our server seemed to be more interested in her cell phone than her customers), it was an all around pretty disappointing experience. I will give it this though.. there is a ton of huge TVs in there!"}
