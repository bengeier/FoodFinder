{"text":"Omg the Uncle Dino is in my opinion the best hot sausage sandwich ever. It's not hot it's crumbled which I prefer to links. More peppers more onions to please however and just add some fennel to the sausage mix and just a little heat. But I truly love it!!. The Canookis satisfy my sweet tooth but just a little too pricey. Otherwise I enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Driving past Yoli's I spied a sign out front that said \"munch\" was here. So I stopped in and tried Yoli's for the first time. The pizza has an excellent crust and was loaded with lots of cheese. I wasn't blown away by the sauce which was a bit bland. I also tried the 6-inch steak hoagie. It comes on a rather small sausage roll. The steak was very tasty though. I'll definitely give Yoli's another try. Their \"Heater\" pizza with sausage and capicolla sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"I was excited to hear about a new pizza place in my neighborhood, but my first experience with Yoli's was underwhelming.  First, they got the order wrong.  I asked for half pepperoni and half peppers, and they delivered a pizza that was half plain and the other half with pepperoni and peppers combined.  No big deal, but if you asked for half and half, wouldn't you expect one half to be pepperoni and the other to be peppers?

The house red sauce was ok, and there was enough of it, but it wasn't all that flavorful.  The toppings were acceptable, but the crust is tough and chewy.  I was almost wondering if it was pre-made crust and not fresh?  A new crust recipe would help for sure.  

To their credit, the pizza was pretty hot when it was delivered.  I'll try them again, because I know it takes a while for a new place to work out the kinks.  But as it is now, the pizza is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Best menu in the south hills... the food is amazing!!! Doesn't matter what you order it's all amazing"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to hear about a new pizza place in the area. Having lived in New York City for over 2 years, anything different around these parts is greatly welcomed. 

That being said, I ordered a half pepperoni, half mushroom pizza; it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great. The pizza reminded me a lot of a digiorno or other frozen pizza. The dough was nothing special, a little thick for my liking (New York thin crust all the way) but it was edible. The sauce? Didn't have much flavor to me, not even a very tomato-ey flavor. Pepperoni, pretty sure it was prepackaged from the grocery store. 

Did this dish satisfy my hunger? Yes. Will I order it again? If I'm hungry enough and all other pizza/food delivery places are closed, then yes. Was it the best pizza I've ever had? Far from it."}
{"text":"Good pizza place, we order here a few times a year. Skip the actual pizza though, the other stuff on the menu is better. Our favorites are the yoli roll, brussel sprout app, any wings. Their subs are okay, more bread than meat, but fresh."}
{"text":"A great pizza. Delivery was quick and the pizza hot. Staff is very friendly. My pizza snob husband from Chicago raved about it! Want to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"first time trying yolis. we ordered take out and from the start had a positive experience. staff was very pleasant and very welcoming. they create the we feed you like family atmosphere. we ordered the notorious pig, baked chicken and argulas sandwhich and breadsticks. everything was absolutely delicious..you can tell they use quality ingredients. they set themselves apart from any other pizza shop by offering unique options with everything on their menu. glad someone broke the mold. we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken wings! Great seasoning. The pulled pork rolls were unlike anything I've ever had. So good. The pizza is made with fresh ingredients and had good crust too. A little bit pricy but imo it's worth it if you want better food than your standard pizza place."}
{"text":"We love this pizza! Food is great, especially love the pepperoni rolls.  The owner was so nice and personable."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I've had. All fresh ingredients and great value for the price. I recommend the coach nola special, where you can try the pizza and some of the oven baked sandwiches. The provonello sticks are also amazing as well. My girlfriend and dad always ask when we are going to Yoli's again. Everyone I know that has been here compliments the friendly staff and the fresh ingredients. Now I just need to try some of their desserts!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but I couldn't let this one go! I was in the area for a summer camp field trip to the wave pool. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we needed to change our plans and find a place that will feed 70 hungry kids fast! We searched around and found Yoli's (good thing we did)! They were able to push out 16 pizzas and 3 hoagies in an hour!! The staff there were extremely accommodating, nice, and the food tasted great!! I also highly recommend the Notorious PIG specialty pizza. Thanks Yoli's for making our summer camp happy last Thursday!!"}
{"text":"This was our second trip here and it's definitely a great place to go for pizza, subs, not so much. The bread seemed stale and not a whole lot of meat either. Staff is great and extremely friendly. This is our new pizza place for sure."}
{"text":"I truly believe they have some of the best local food but the worst customer service . I am a steady customer who averages one delivery order a week. Called at 7pm Sunday when the advertised hours are till 9pm and they said they couldn't take my order. Called at 8:05 Pm on playoff hockey night and they refused to take a delivery order. At least other local shops wanted my business ."}
{"text":"We have been hearing about this place for z few months now and decided to show up Friday night. I checked the YELP reviews in advance to plan out our selections.   The sliced pizza rolls and the full sized wings were excellent and the friendly staff really put you at ease.  This sounds like almost all of the other ratings but it's all true."}
{"text":"Yoli's Pizza makes you feel right at home.  Everything absolutely exceeded expectations. Between the fresh foods the authentic Italian ingredients and the polite and interactive staff I don't think I could come up with a negative thing to say if I was sent out to look for one.  

Their specials are great deals and you often get more than your money's worth. The sauce gives Fiori's a serious run for it's money.   The pizzas are massive and the dough is done perfectly. 

The hot sausage, meat balls,  and slow cooked beef all were amazing.

Everyone talks about the new food spots in Pittsburgh and Yoli's deserves to be heard about."}
{"text":"We happen to see a review for Yolis on here and decided to try it while out working. It was a very cute, clean little place. Everyone was super friendly and it smelled delicious as they cooked in the back. We ended up just getting a pepperoni pizza but it was amazing. Once it cooled a little you could taste the flavors in each slice. A family next to us got \"the heater\" they said it tasted as great as it smelled. I look forward to trying that next time and trying the jumbo wings! Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Great options make this more than just a pizza place. I recommend the Yoli Roli, dry rub wings, and, yes, the 3B sprouts."}
{"text":"I could live in the Sunday sauce. So far I've had there pizza and breadsticks in a few different orders and it's all been good each time."}
{"text":"An hour and a half for delivery!  Pizza was lukewarm when it finally arrived. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't Know why the reviews for this place are so high. The food sucks, very dry and bland and the pizza is terrible I have had this place 3 times thinking it would be better and it hasn't. The mother clucker sandwich is so dry you need to eat it with a ton of ranch or wash down with water. The pizza wasn't good at all (the one with fresh mozzarella). Won't order ever again."}
{"text":"This place makes awesome food.  Really love it.

What I am not a fan of is the fact their hoagies are $9.60 with tax, and their minimum delivery charge is $10.00.  I'm single, why make me eat more food than I need?  I'd order from this place almost every day if it wasn't for that stupid minimum delivery charge.

:facepalm:"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The pizza, salads, and Yoli's rolls all great. Yoli rolls like huge pepperoni rolls even better! The saltomboca sub is also DELICIOUS! Grilled chicken, spinach, and proscioutta! However, what I feel really makes this place stand out is the incredible kindness of the staff! Once they gave me a free large cheese pizza just because. They make you proud to give them business!"}
{"text":"pizzas ok.. asked for wings extra crispy when they arrived they were deffinetly not cooked long enough."}
{"text":"On travel and wanted to order pizza in. Tried yoli's and wasn't disappointed. Got the heater and it was hot!! Loved the sauce and crust. Great all around."}
{"text":"Yoli's is my new favorite delivery pizza place.  Have yet to order something I didn't love.  The staff are super friendly, the choices are great.  The dry rub wings are the best around.  And the pizza is fantastic.

The only bad thing is they are so popular, it can sometimes be difficult to get through to place an order.  So I just try and be prepared."}
{"text":"Very different place then usual. In a very good way. They serve brussels sprouts. No really! And they are damn good. Awesomesauce. A fav. 
The vibe when you walk on this place is like no other. Feel like you open the door and walked right into a Kitchen of happy Italian vibes. Thee most comfortable feeling in a pizza shop i ever felt. 
Wings are big and bomb. 
Subs were good as well. 
And sprouts, like seriously, don't know how it made, but surely won me over. 
The meatball, fantastic. Love it. 
Haven't tried the pizza, but will soon. 

Overall great atmosphere, good ownership, cooks with love and fun and sprouts lol."}
{"text":"This place is one of the more unknown and underrated pizza places in the south hills.  I have only been here once, but I will definitely be back.

My wife and I ordered a plain pizza, breadsticks, and a yoli roll.  The pizza was delicious.  Despite it being very cheesy, the pizza was not greasy and held together well.  The breadsticks are some of the best I have ever had.  They were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Finally, I would recommend getting a yoli roll.  This was a little greasy, but that is what made it so good.  All of the flavors went together perfect.  On top of the great food, they also had some great homemade ranch which went great with the pizza and yoli roll.

I will definitely be back to try their subs and specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! The yoli Rollie's are a must have, hand rolled with cheese and pepperoni. Authentic  and fresh food. Plenty to share with each order. You must come to yolis if you're in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Growing up in NYC has definitely spoiled me. I am what you call a pizza snob. I have trying different places all over Pittsburgh and have not found one that I truly like until I found this place. The pizza was really good. Still not my absolute favorite- but still really good. One of my favorite items is the 3 B's. I can eat that every day."}
{"text":"I've made pizza for years and pizza is for sure my favorite food. Yoli's is one of the best shops in Pittsburgh, even though it's in the suburbs. It stands tall with the greats and gives Mineo's, Fiori's and Aiello's a strong run for their money."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 18\" pizzas. One with pepperoni and one with mama's meatballs. Both were great. Cooked perfect and very tasty. Be sure to try the sunday sauce. I got the sunday sauce with the mama's meatballs and it was excellent. It had a very good flavor."}
{"text":"BOSTON DAVE and myself dropped in on Saturday after seeing a posted picture  of a connookie.  I decided to try 1/2 of the Doni (hot sausage) sandwich. Omg it was the absolute best I've ever eaten. The sausage was crumbled which I  Iove even more. With onions peppers and cheese ! The roll must have been freshly made  and it was fabulous as well. The salad I ordered with it was a delectable blend of mixed greens with their house made Italian . Sooo good.!!!  And what I went for the canookie?? Well let me just say it was gone in 60 seconds!!!.  Definite do again. My only regret is I'd love more  meat on it.  The food is by far authentically made home style Italiano. The whole family history is on a portrait wall of generations young and old. A 5 very warm and friendly  attentive staff. Overall an A+ 5."}
{"text":"Good fresh ingredients and friendly staff. Everything I've had there is fantastic including he fab five pizza."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place and I have been to many
There's homemade sauce that comes straight from the bosses family it's delicious and I recommend going if you have the chance"}
{"text":"Tried Yoli by Yelp recommendations after soccer today. Everything was delicious!! Yoli rolls, pizza, steak hoagies....Quality ingredients, some fun and different menu items. Can't wait to try the cannoli later for dessert. Meeting the owner Benny was an honor...A person who loves his business and gets to know every customer who comes in the door....Give them a try! Benny, we will wait patiently for the Irwin location!"}
{"text":"Pizza is among the best in the area, a true \"mom and pop\" place, nothing like the chain pizzas!  Everything tasted fresh and homemade. And you can even eat in, and there are not a lot of eat-in pizza joints that are not chains.  The chef/boss was friendly and courteous.  Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Thankful to have enjoyed a great meal with some wonderful friends at a little known diamond in the rough, hometown style pizza joint tonight.  About 25 minutes south of the city, Yoli's Pizza has so much more than pizza. 

Everything is made from scratch.  You have to get their baked jalapeño poppers, the 3B's(baked Brussel sprouts, bacon, and balsamic), and the stuffed banana peppers.  So worth the drive."}
{"text":"Ben is a close family friend and one of the nicest people I know. Like the slogan, you will be treated like family. Don't pass up the Canookie! It's my favorite and they have gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"Yolis is our favorite pizza place in the area. The yoli rollis are amazing and so is the pizza!We've ordered the Fab 5 and the Pittsburgh Pierogie pizza - both are really good!  My husband always comments on how friendly and personable they are when he goes to pick up the order. Great customer service and food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried out this new place on a whim right before they closed. GREAT pizza. Perfectly cooked crust, the sauce was excellent with the right amount of cheese. Most importantly the staff was so friendly. Their slogan is \"feed you like family\" and they did just that. I would absolutely recommend this place and will definitely be ordering again for my next pizza fix. Best pizza in the area hands down."}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of why people should check out reviews on Yelp. A friend told us about this place. We checked Yelp reviews to see if there were any suggestions on what to order. We took their advice and ordered the dry rub wings and the Yovi Roll. The reviewers were right!!!  They were both fantastic!!!  If we hadn't read the review we might have just ordered pizza. My review might have been different and less stars may have been given. 
The dry rub wings are WHOLE wings. The are fried and then tossed in the dry rub. The rub is several different spices. You taste sweet, salty, and a smidge of heat. The wings are juicy inside. To quote another eating establishment, they were \"finger licking good.\"  
The Yovi roll is where they take the crust of a medium pizza and slici it into strips. They add a little bit of sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and garlic. The turn the rolled up slices slices on their sides so they resemble cinnamon rolls.  They cover a whole pizza pan. They serve them with grated Parmesan cheese and a buttery garlic sauce on top. They also include a cup of pizza sauce to dip them in. Three to four people could share a pan of these.  When you buy into the roll it is delicious and the cheese is gooey and stringy. YUM!
We loved both items and took home a lot of left overs. We would like to go back and try their Brussels Sprouts and Meatballs."}
{"text":"They have some of the best pizza in the south hills. The pierogie and aunt Donna are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"Great food and courteous service... Whether you eat in or take out or even for delivery... Always consistent and always tasty"}
{"text":"Good pizza for Pennsylvania, still looking for that New York style pizza.  The rolls are good.  Place is difficult to find at night and it looks like it might be a storage unit but it is worth the hunt as so far it is the best pizza we have found in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Yum! 

We saw Yoli's advertised on the front of the Clipper Magazine. Curious, I looked up the menu and reviews. It sounded really good and everyone else seemed to rave about it. We decided to give it a try. 

We ordered the cheese sticks, breadsticks, the Aunt Donna and the Fab 5. As a vegetarian, we ordered the Fab 5 without chicken or bacon. Everything was so flavorful. The thickness of crust was absolutely perfect. It was thick enough to hold the weight of the toppings, but not too thick. The ratio was incredible. The Sunday Sauce was so flavorful and absolutely delicious. 

We decided to eat the pizza there, they have a couple booths and we were blown away by the service. The employees were friendly and attentive. We received better service at Yoli's than we do at actual sit down restaurants. 

We were amazed at the constant stream of people coming and going while were eating and now understand. While expensive, the food and service were well worth it. We will be regulars now!"}
{"text":"Yoli's was an awesome find off the beaten path. They make a great pie and have amazing customer service. The owner came out and visited with us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. Very friendly guy and great staff. Thanks Yoli's from your new friends from Utah!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered from them once, but I was really impressed! Try the Brussel sprouts and the Yoli Roli! Delicious!! The prices are a little high, but you can tell the food is fresh and they use high quality ingredients. Even if you don't like Brussel sprouts, you must try their's!! The pizza wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad either. Definitely worth a try if you haven't eaten here!

We've ordered many times since the original review & I must say Yoli's is the best in the south hills that we have tried. I actually love the pizza, and all items on the menu that I have tried seem to be made with high quality ingredients. Everything is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"We were tired of the same old South Hills pizza shops.  We have eaten at Mmm and Danny's and Bishops and many others many many times.  After hearing rave reviews from our friends and neighbors about Yoli's my wife surprised me and ordered us up some pizzas and special rolls.  Oh my.  It was delicious.  I tried a bite as soon as she got home to tame my hunger only to turn back and quickly devour another slice and a hunk of their special roll made with perfect dough, savory sausage and peppers.  It was unbelievably good.  These folks know what they are doing.  Now that we have talked about the food - most important - let's talk about the service.  My beautiful wife was welcomed into the pizza shop with smiles and conversation by the workers and maybe even the owner (didn't ask, but think so).  Awesome.  Beyond that, when she got home, we realized we were missing a pepperoni pie.  Now we had a big order, but we needed our pie.  We called them and advised them of our dilemma.  Not only did they offer to deliver the forgotten goodness, they actually MADE A WHOLE OTHER PIZZA FRESH AND DELIVERED BOTH TO OUR DOORSTEP IN SHORT ORDER!!!  Who does this?!  Yoli's!  We are hooked and we will be back again very soon you terrific sauce slinging son of a guns!!!!"}
