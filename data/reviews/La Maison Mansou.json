{"text":"Really disappointed in my takeout yesterday. I bothered going out of my way to this restaurant and I feel like I got scammed.
I don't eat meat so when I order veggie noodles, I expect to pay for just that. Not get charged for Cantonese style noodles, which normally include, shrimp, pork and chicken. You omit half of the items, the most expensive items I might add and you charge me $15 + taxes?!?? You didn't even add more veggies! Highway robbery for two cups of noodles. $43 for about $15 - 20$ worth of food. You'd think that charging that kind of money you would fix that place up. There are literally parts of walls missing or nay clean the place.
First and last time I set foot in here. To be avoided unless you like poker machines."}
