{"text":"I had such a great experience here. I brought my 2-month-old in her car seat and was given a large table. I was treated like a special guest at someone's house. My lunch was delicious, and my latte was perfect.
Great music, nice atmosphere, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot to stop and grab coffee and a snack while you're out and about on Sherbrooke.    It's not in the center of things but it's totally worth the walk down the road.
Charming, great coffee, friendly staff.  
About the menu - some things are well priced, other things are overpriced.    The food is good, much like a lot of cafes."}
{"text":"Yowza! The food is certainly adequate, but it's way too expensive. Some items on the (very limited) menu are about twice as much as I expect to pay elsewhere. I should have been blown away by the food at this price point, but I wasn't.

The seating is comfortable, though, and good service was available in English and French."}
{"text":"I don't know if all the review hate is coming from before they updated the place but I have to think so because my visit was great! The specials board wasn't up to date but the super cool waitress was keen to list the correct options for us. We split a large salad  + Burger/fries. The meal salad was great and fresh, only could have been better with goat cheese to really  balance it. The burger was delicious but tiny, and ended up coming with a cesar salad instead which ended up being one of the best cesars I've ever had! Just the smell from the dressing caught me, plus little pieces of baked bacon, so tasty! I also loved their fresh OJ because they filter out the pulp. Dishes were all priced $10 or less!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this cafe on vacation this morning for my morning necessity - coffee.

I am happy to report that their coffee was perfectly roasted, with only a slightly acidic aftertaste.  It is easily comparable to the best coffee in San Francisco (Peet's) as well as the best coffee in Seattle (Vivace).

The barista recommended their pesto sandwich - a layer of pesto on a ciabatta roll,  each half covered with a layer of creamy white melted cheese which sandwiched crisp lettuce and a light aioli.  The whole thing was toasted to perfection, cut in half and served with a skewered grape on each half.

Sadly, the owner was rude and demanded that I not take any pictures, even of the food.  I've been assured by my host that this is a cultural difference between the U.S. and Montreal, but he nearly made me cry.

However, all that said - this sandwich was one of the best things I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth.  The ultimate combination of crisp lettuce with an only slightly chewy bun, showcasing the warm melty cheese - highly recommended.  I will definitely be back tomorrow for my morning coffee, hopefully I will be able to avoid the owner and may even sneak a picture of the beautifully presented latte.

Minus a star for the rude owner, sadly.  :("}
