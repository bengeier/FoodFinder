{"text":"I'm living close of this new Verdun gem and I'm very happy about that. So far I've tried three of their dishes and they've been very filling and excellent.   The breakfast poutine was a discovery. The 'fond de veau' sauce was very tasty and melded all the ingredients together ; braised ham, an egg (usually sunny side up but you can ask to cook it however you want), perfectly cooked bacon and of course, potatoes and cheese under all that goodness. It's a big portion, but that's ok, you can bring back the rest home (I encourage you too, if you got a toaster oven, it heats very well).  The cassoulet also is the same way. Immensely tasty with braised ham and an egg on top. Accompanied with two pieces of toast. It may look small but it's oh so filling. That time I eat the entire thing.  (So good, almost no remorse!)  Last thing I ate was the bacon pankake. I chose it to eat light but coudn't stop myself from finishing the whole thing. (Oups) The two thick but fluffy pancakes were the bread of a ricotta sandwich. With bacon and maple syrup. Had every for hours after eating that dish :)   Gotta go back soon to try the rest of their menu... there's a toast edamame with my name on it...."}
{"text":"C'est nouveau, c'est tout frais. J'adore les nouveautés. Et pour un brunch c'est bien sympathique, l'ambiance est cool sur fond de hip hop des années 90. J'adore. Le service est très sympa. Pour commencer, j'ai pris un brunch classique avec deux oeufs, bacon et pommes  de terre frites."}
{"text":"THE WELL WAS AMAZING!!! I had the classic bacon and eggs breakfast- totally worth it! The bacon was thick and out of this world DELICIOUS!! Cannot wait to go back and try their more original dishes! Staff was great and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. I had an americano with my meal. The reason why I took off 1 star is because my husband and I like a good filter coffee with our breakfast. We were disapointed that only specialty coffees are available. Please add filter coffee to your menu!!! It would be amazing!! We will be back regardless though"}
{"text":"Brunch in Verdun!   Pretty hipster place for brunch. Service was good, we were served quick and they made sure eveything was good throughout the meal. Their latte was good, strong coffee!   I tried their ricotta's pancakes with bacon. It was good but not more. Also had their breakfast poutine, pretty normal too.  No line up! It was actually pretty empty for a saturday... maybe its not known yet!  Friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Suite à ma deuxième visite, je dois dire que malgré les prix un peu plus hauts que la moyenne, la qualité des ingrédients est impeccable. Leur pain maison est délicieux et leur bacon, c'est du vrai de vrai. Le service fut un peu long mais sans plus. Le latté glacé était vraiment bon. J'ajoute une étoile parce qu'après avoir donné une deuxième chance à ce petit endroit, je pense qu'il vaut le détour."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is awesome! My first reaction to my meal.  This is F&@#$en good!   I can't wait to go back and try something else from the menu.   Fresh, tasty, not typical but some traditional dishes.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in around noon on a Sunday. As expected, the place was packed. We waited less than 10 minutes and we were seated at the bar.  I ordered a latte and my friend an espresso, which were served quickly, our food arrived only a few minutes after.  We both chose the poutine, his with bacon and mine with fried chicken (extra $2). I have to say it is the best breakfast poutine I ever had. The extra is worth it for the fried chicken, it was extra crispy and tender. Sauce was a spicy veal fond type. My only complaint was that the sauce was too salty. I advise the waitress after my meal and she kindly said that she would advise the chef.  The service was awesome and quick. It is clear that these individuals have a great relationship with one another. We could witness everyone running around and handling everything in team.  I will have to go back and try plates I saw coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Beau petit spot pour le brunch dans Verdun! Aujourd'hui c'était ma deuxième visite au Well et je l'ai bien apprécié. Le service est toujours très courtois et chaleureux et le déjeuner est clairement préparé avec amour. Je dirais que c'est un peu plus dispendieux que la moyenne des spots de brunch, mais tu paies définitivement pour de la qualité!  Je m'explique. Mon choix de déjeuner: Le Classique, soit 2 ufs tournés avec du bacon et des petites patates. Généralement quand tu commande ça, tu reçois 2 ufs tournés, du bacon Lafleur (pas de Ready Crisp svp!), des petites patates, deux tranches de pain POM, des petits fruits un peu douteux et du café filtre à volonté pour genre 6.75$.   Au Well, Le Classique - C'est le nom sur le menu - tu reçois 2 ufs tournés (ou à ton goût) avec un peu d'épices et des onions verts, des petites patates épicées et bien garnies, 4 belles tranches épaisses de Bacon (comme chez le boucher) et du délicieux pain croûté (pas mal certaine que c'est fait maison - en tout cas c'est ça que ça goûte!).12$.   Même sans café et sans petits fruits c'est clairement un déjeuner génial et très satisfaisant! Aussi, offrez-vous donc un bon bol de café au lait, il est franchement bon!   En tout cas ça démarre très bien la journée!  Note: la photo n'est pas celle du déjeuner décrit dans mon avis. C'est celui de ma première visite au Well. Très bon d'ailleurs, mais je ne me souvenais plus du nom. Et ben!"}
{"text":"Foodwise, it was great. My friend and I shared the bacon pancake and the fruit pancake. Size of dishes is generous. As for the rest of the menu,  variety seems reasonable.  Also had a latte bowl. Quality of the coffee is good. BUT, there is no filtre coffee, which is pretty odd for a brunch place but tolerable.  The biggest issue here was the staff. Friendly, yes. Efficient, yes. Professional, not so much. As we were sitting at the bar, staff was eating behind the bar. At one point, this young girl was having her breakfast right in front of me. Come on guys... More over, some of them were on their phone in client's face.... a big no. If there was a manager on the floor, he or she wasn't sharp enough to see these obvious professionalism errors. Not unfixable, but needs some polish."}
{"text":"It's rare that I eat in Verdun, since it's quite inconvenient for me to do the traveling, but I have heard so many good things about Well that I decided to pay a visit. Usually it's quite crowded, even during the week, because people would go to this place just to take pictures since it's a really instagrammable restaurant with houseplants and beautiful decor. I was super lucky to go there on a Tuesday and I was enjoying my food super quietly. I took the dish recommended by the staff: il Fungo (mushroom, nuts and tofu on arancini), it was super flavourful and well-balanced! It might sound funky and exotic but the taste was wow, and the price very fair. I love the place and the service, would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"New brunch spot in Verdun! Has the old usuals like bacon and eggs and home fries but also offers unique upscale twists like bone marrow with eggs, fried chicken sandwich with avocado and a fried egg on top (called the Pablo) , ricotta pancakes with bacon, bacon (or pulled pork) and eggs breakfast poutine, smoothies and a few alcoholic beverages. I had the Pablo and struggled to finish it, portions are very generous here. You don't have to eat for the rest of the day. The people who run the place are young and enthusiastic. The space is a narrow breakfast bar with additional tables against the wall. The place was packed when I walked in at 1pm and it's been barely open for a week! Bit of a hipster vibe, I saw a few man buns on display but given that Verdun has been undergoing gentrification and hipsters and other folks have been leaving the Mile End and the Plateau to come to Verdun, it's not surprising.  Another win for Verdun!"}
{"text":"The brunch is here GIGANORMOUS! Literally, each plate is 3x the size of my face (proof at 6.03m of the vlog https://youtu.be/IvSf50SxKEM)   I had El Paso: 2 thick slices of fresh bread covering a generous piece of fried chicken. Those alone could have fed two people... but they came with a sunny side up egg and a very generous portion of roasted potatoes. #foodcoma"}
{"text":"Over several months I have eaten through the menu here with minimal complaint:  - Their house (peach) preserve is basically unspreadable - Their pickled cauliflower leaves much to be desired - Sausages are not offered (only bacon and ham) - The standard table setting does not include spoons (?) - The confined corridor by the (gender-neutral) bathrooms occasionally becomes crowded due to coat racks and a kitchen exit  Forgive me, as those are the only serious faults I can muster.  The menu is planned well, generally making use of minimal ingredients to please many.  For the kids: a generous pancake, bacon and eggs, or yogurt with fresh fruit is available for a reasonable price ($5).  For the adults: several vegan to pescetarian options, two versions of pancakes, and various offerings based primarily upon braised ham and thick-cut smoky bacon.  In accompaniment to wash it all down, delicious espresso-based coffee (read: Americanos only, filter-folks), smoothie and alcoholic options.  The latest vegan addition might catch your eye because it screams at you in app caps: IL FUNGO.  It is a take on arancini with mushroom, tofu and nuts that comes with a roasted red pepper sauce.  It's tasty but might not be enough to quell a serious appetite.  Edamame toast with smoked salmon and a poached egg might be better to do the trick here, but be warned you must have an appetite for many soybeans as there's a sizable portion.  The crunchy salad is reasonable with a light vinaigrette that makes a suitable meal on the tailend of brunch, though the walnuts were once verging on rancidity.  There's nothing wrong with the yogurt with granola, hemp seeds and fruit, though it's difficult to personally justify the cost for what amounts to a parfait I could assemble easily at home.  It's a creamy, not particularly sweet natural yogurt, served with a variety of berries that will surely improve as we're entering Quebec's berry season.  Entering the heavier territory, we have the cassoulet with braised ham and the bacon poutines.  While these are delicious options, the take on cassoulet is a bit too sweet for me (using housemade baked beans here) to eat an entire plate without diminishing returns and the poutine is, well, going to put a damper on whatever you had planned that afternoon (but in a good way.)  The pancakes are second to none, and the bacon portions with any dish here are so generous (easily double the average brunch and well justified at $6 for an additional side), smoky and fatty that it's difficult to stop even once your stomach pleads.  It may be prudent to go with the lighter fruit option with the pancakes here, but with a true sacrifice in enjoyment.  El Pablo is a bit of an outlier: passable fried chicken that's a missed opportunity on the classic chicken/waffles riff, instead with avocado and egg.  It's decent fare and, it should be noted, is quickly punched up a nnotch with a fiery hot sauce available on request with any order.  They hardly break the bank, but for the money invested in the braised beef grilled cheese or \"the sandwich\", I'd recommend assembling your own from the offerings in the classic unless you were completely set on a grilled cheese from the go ahead.  There is only one bread offering -- a house made white loaf -- which might irk some set on healthier fare, but it is a quality loaf that's suitable for sopping yolks or constructing the aforementioned sandwiches.  I'm also a fan of the scrambled eggs with feta and fresh herbs (think pesto scramble, I suppose), but would regret ordering it without a companion willing to share at least one slice of bacon with me.  All in all you really can't go wrong with Well.  It just might be prudent to head there a little early on the weekend."}
{"text":"Hip breakfast/brunch place in Verdun that played hip hop when we got in. Hipster??? Well (duh) yes. Not that I have anything against hipsters lol! The service was very good and the vibe quite casual. Another good addition to the area. I got the classic 2 eggs and ham with potatoes and toasts. Hubby got the breakfast sandwich which he really enjoyed. I would of given this place a 4 stars but they gave me burnt toasts (very burnt). The toasts were placed in a strategic position so that I wouldn't notice it at first. The better side of it was up. I didn't wanted to make a fuss but hubby insisted on having the problem fixed which they gladly gave me another toast still a bit burnt but better then the first try. Prices are a bit higher then the usual breakfast place but ingredients are better also. They make their own bread too. But other then that, the food was good and service as well."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is awesome! The service is excellent as is the food.  Don't miss out on this gem.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, but don't let that stop you."}
