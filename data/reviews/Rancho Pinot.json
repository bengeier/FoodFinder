{"text":"Seriously...this is our favorite place in the entire valley..and the best part is Chef Chrysa is one of the most talented chefs around and has a real sense of humor."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice before this visit.  Always good. We both had a dinner salad and the flatiron steak.  Superb. The greens had a \"just picked from the garden\" taste, and the steak was savory and tender. Along with the pecan dessert,  the meal was perfect."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Rancho for years.  I think it keeps getting better.  The food is fresh, local and always well prepared.  If you are lucky enough to come on a night Chrysa (owner/chef) has made pie you are in for a treat.  Her pies are the best in the state.  The crust is flaky, tender and often the fruit in the pie is picked that day.  It does not get any better.  The service is professional and friendly.  They know the food and the wine and are very helpful trying to decide from everything (because it is all so good).  

I highly recommend Rancho Pinot."}
{"text":"Add locally grown fresh ingredients with vegetarian options add a dash of creative flair with an awesome wine selection and what do you get? A restaurant worth returning to.

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our dinners immensely. We both chose salads to start the meal. It was difficult to make a selection because all of the salad choices had interesting components. My dining companion settled on the Summer Butternut Squash salad-triple yum. I chose the Watermelon salad which was outstanding. This colorful salad had watermelon, avocado, olives, greens and they listed feta as the cheese but it tasted like blue cheese (which was fine with me..)

For our entrees, I chose the Roasted Vegetable plate. I have had a variation of this at other restaurants but this was hands-down the most delicious and colorful of veggie plates.  I also ordered a side of sauteed shishito peppers for some extra spice! My bf ordered the quail which was excellent.

The decor as others have mentioned is cowboy/AZ and it isn't a ''romantic\" restaurant  per se but nonetheless it works as the focal point is the food and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Rancho Pinot Grill is outstanding. Everything that we had was perfectly prepared and seemed as it was specifically made just for us. The food, wines and service all came together to create a very memorable experience. We have dined here several times and have yet to be disappointed by any aspect of this fine restaurant. Without question worth trying!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit after many recommendations of the place.   We read the reviews that stated that the Nonni's Sunday Chicken dish was out of this world. My wife and I both ordered that dish.  Braised thigh meat (a large helping) in a mushroom, onion, white wine sauce, with crispy polenta on the side, was to die for.  We were given a soup spoon that we both used to scoop every bit off the plate.  We had different desserts and each was super.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who is into fine dining in a casual atmosphere.  If you are lucky enough to have a waiter named \"Fritz\" you will not only get good and fast service, but you will have a waiter who really knows his food preparation."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 and 1/2 stars with a great fresh, local menu and fantastic wine list! 

My last meal here was excellent with a very knowledgeable and honest server who provided a great dining experience. 

Some of the highlights were the asparagus, the beet salad and the short ribs! Oh my gosh did I love all 3 and I have been craving hominy ever since!! Plus, they even had a favorite bottle of wine that my BF and I covet that can't even be bought at the vineyard anymore (I'm not telling as I know they have one other bottle left and I don't want anyone to drink it!!) 

Decor is a little Scottsdale circa 1987, but you can tell that this is a great kept secret in Scottsdale! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"There is no way I would eat here again. While the staff were certainly friendly and attentive, the food leaves much to be desired. We had a vegetarian in our party and when I made reservations, they told me there were plenty of vegetarian options. NOT! They have salads, side dish vegetables and one small pasta dish that they could leave the sausage out of. We asked if the mushroom pasta was vegetarian (which it wasn't) and the waitress spoke with the chef to see if it could be made vegetarian. Nope! Really??? They don't have vegetable stock or wine that could have been used in place of the non-vegetarian stock? And is the chef that incapable of creating a dish on the fly to accommodate vegetarians? RIDICULOUS!

All four of our meals were mediocre at best and way overpriced for what they were...small portions and not very flavorful. Oh, and $11.00 for vodka on ice, with olives!!! So disappointed because we enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff."}
{"text":"Just had another great meal here. This has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Made it out for restaurant week. Fantastic food and always a great menu."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, fresh and flavorful; a long time favorite in a town with many restaurants to choose from. Much more of a local favorite than a tourist spot."}
{"text":"Racho Pinot is everything Arizona. Make sure to try the exceptional wine list to be paired with even better meat and fish dishes. Rancho Pinot has a soft and relaxed atmosphere, but nicer dress seems appropriate. Service is great as well"}
{"text":"First time visit for dinner on Feb 14th, 2015 so I don't have reference to 'the way it used to be', however:

1) Quality - 4.5
a - Good quality food, interesting flavors, unique items - definitely RP's strongest aspect
b - Side dish of roasted carrots prepared with pistachio dukka was REALLY good!
c - Beef was good/tender and fish was good/crispy skin (citrus cream sauce was a bit heavy handed) but super tiny portion of fish

2) Price/Value - 1
a - WAY too high for the portions; at least 20% over comparable 'upscale casual' competitors
b - Total price for me, wife and 2.5 year old = ~$140 tip included
- 2 entrees (beef/fish - shared with daughter), 2 total beers, 1 side order (delicious carrots!), 2 desserts ($10/each).
- Portion of fish was, how do I say, teensy on a bed of savory mushroom. Wife's immediate reaction (look in her eye) was 'should we order another entree for you?'
c - A $42 beef entree REALLY ought to include sides; something. Although I loved the carrot side dish we ordered separately, this seemed exorbitant.

3) Ambiance - 3.5
a - Casual and friendly; decor is Southwest style complete with Saguaro skeleton and bull-skulls on the wall
b - Big open central room, so not ideal romantic spot
c - Parking was a bit of a hassle; large lot but multiple stores in this upscale 'strip mall' location; drove around lot 3 times to find a spot

4) Service - 3 (due to slow kitchen/staff was very good)
a - Friendly/down to earth staff/'just right' checking in with us 
b - Food was slow to arrive/ however measured on a very busy night 

Overall: 3 - 
Worthy of a 2nd visit due to food quality and uniqueness; perhaps a lunch menu has more down to earth pricing. We just arrived from CA and thought this place was high, go figure."}
{"text":"This seems to be a very popular place with the older folks. The average age in the place seemed to be around 65. Terrible decor and the food was just ok. Not worth the prices. I will say that my fish was excellent and the wine selection was decent. My husband's pasta dish was just ok. Not worth it for the price! I would definitely say skip it! There are too many other great places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great dinner with the wifey.  Can't believe we just found this place.  Everything from menu, to service and all we ordered were top notch! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"A well oiled operation with amazing timing on delivering the courses hot and delicious. The Berkshire pork is melt in your mouth Yummy. Salads are $$ but clever and abundant.
Some great Arizona brews.  We will return@!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night, for a first date, and needless to say, it was interesting... not the kind of interesting where it was bad and you're trying to be nice. And the date, well that's another story...

I don't really like the decor. It's kind of got the Arizona cowboy/cowgirl thing going on which is cool, but I think that saddle ranch might have a better decorator guys.

Got a bottle of wine. It was the Cote de Nuits Villages - Louis Jadot. Great, earthy pinot noir - (was her choice) Im a hard liquor drinker myself... Anyways, our server corked, decantered (their decanters are awesome by the way)  and poured. It's a good wine... I guess.

Started with the grilled squid & shrimp salad, and the chantrelle & fried egg salad. Instead of one for each of us we were on a sharing frenzy. More to try? Cool with me! Both were fantastic! If you ever go here and they still have it on their menu - Get them. The grilled squid was cut into easily edible pieces which was easy to maintain and not have to dislocate your jaw to eat. Which was a plus since not eating like a rattlesnake is a huge plus on a date. The date thing back again?...  moving on...

Lemon used a lot in this and big pieces of fresh cracked pepper? Perfect.

The chantrelle and fried egg salad was a little too warn for my liking - I kind of expect a salad to be cold... maybe I was conditioned this way. That was just a little off, but it was still good. Popped the yolk, mixed it in, yum.

For dinner we did the Grilled Quail with creamy polenta, sauteed greens and fruit mostrada. Excellent. for the sides we did the braised endive, roasted turnips, and apples with the blue cheese and walnuts, and the spaghetti squash, sage-honey butter, and hazelnuts. These were perfect additions to the quail, wine, and atmos... ahh almost got me there. Im still lingering on the atmosphere.

That's why I'm doing the 4 - the atmosphere has to take it down by one star. After the remodel (if it ever happens, and it's better than it is now) I'll come back to this and update it. Service was good. Not extremely good, but also nothing to note in a bad sense either.

Overall, a nice white tablecloth, wine, good first date, kind of place to go. Dress accordingly!"}
{"text":"We were is Scottsdale during Thanksgiving week, and went to one of my favorite restaurants in town -- Rancho Pinot Grill. Their lamb chops are the best and I was salivating over them. As usual, they were excellent. Their salads are so fresh tasting that you would think they just pulled the veggies from the garden! Hoge, the long time manager at Ranch Pinot, is a delight to deal with and is as knowledgable about wine as any sommelier. Don't let the strip mall location fool you, as I dare you to find a better restaurant in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Really cool place for drinks. They have a great wine and scotch selection. I want to try their food but haven't made it there for that yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant had several good, savory dishes, including the starter grilled quail with polenta and greens that could be upgraded to an entree ($30), roasted Brussels sprout side ($7), and the flat iron steak ($30) with chimichurra.  Delicious desserts that invoke the flavors of the desert.  The \"keg\" wines were outstanding-- decent value and good flavors.  Service was good, but did not match the priciness of the restaurant.  Cocktail took more than 20 minutes from ordering to serving, with one of our table receiving their cocktail well in advance of the rest of the party (of 5).  Will certainly go back and try again."}
{"text":"I used to live in Arizona but come back regularly to see family.  Rancho Pinot is always my first choice for a relaxing dinner with my mom and dad.  Great vibe, great food, real local Arizona ingredients. Top notch service. A great spot to get a taste of local AZ wines also."}
{"text":"Long overdue dinner with friends - we've all been going to Rancho as a favorite neighborhood spot for many years.  They did not fail to deliver!  Service was stellar, food was delicious - hot right out of the kitchen!  Dessert - heavenly and scratch made!  You cannot beat Rancho Pinot for excellent service, absolutely delicious food and a wonderful atmosphere made for catching up, getting to know you, and satisfying your hunger!"}
{"text":"Started with the sweet gum salad, antipasto, wild quail with polenta then shared gnocchi with bolognese and pasta with Italian sausage!! Enjoyed wine on tap too! Yum! A great find!"}
{"text":"Attentive wait staff, a more diverse menu than one would expect walking in, and a good wine selection."}
{"text":"We walked into the warm inviting room that straddles old southwest cowboy with modern chic, where we were promptly and pleasantly greeted by a young smiling host.  Our table was a bit awkward because we'd reserved for five (the fifth never did make it), and the large roundness made it tough for a four way conversation. But the soft yet not too dim lighting and background din made for a comfortable environment.   The wine list is interesting and we chose a moderately priced obscure Collio.  Saltspring Island mussels came hot and plump.  Seared scallops were delicious in a peanut Asian slaw.  Baked MahiMahi was solid. Our server was perfect: there when we wanted him, pouring just the right amount of wine without intruding and went so far as to promptly and without question replace a dish I ordered wrong because I misunderstood his description. My only pet peeve, and this applies to just about every American restaurant: empty plates are whisked away before my fork hits the table and my husband had to guard his beloved bread and oil like a boarding house school boy. Are you finished with this?  No! I'm still chewing!!  All in all, though, I recommend this restaurant when you're looking for an iconic Scottsdale experience and solidly executed food and service."}
{"text":"We had the most awesome evening. Our server was fabulous, the vibe was perfect and the food was really, really nice. I'd forgotten how much I like that place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. They recently upgraded the interior and it looks fantastic. Great staff that knows everything about their specials and menu. You cant ho wrong between the fish, steaks, chicken or salads. Great portion size, just enough!!"}
{"text":"Ooohhhhhh..... Mmmmmyyyyy.... Gggooosssshhhhh!!!!!! Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Try Nonie's Sunday Chicken.  This place is a little difficult to find in a strip mall, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Scottsdale. Great food, great service. I recommend this place. Bartender and server Jimmy goes above and beyond. Great recommendations and conversation."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service! What a great find.  I can't believe  we've never been there. This is not one of those new, hot Scottsdale restaurants, but it's been in business for 23 years for a reason! I went with my family of 5 and every one of us loved our dish. The decor is a bit outdated but it was quiet and comfortable which is hard to find these days. 

I had the lamb chops which was cooked perfectly, and I loved the white bean side that it came with. Two of our group had the fish which was also delicious. 

Our waiter, Julianna, was friendly and very knowledgeable. You can tell she loves her job. We left feeling like family and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"this place is tasty!

came here with co-workers for dinner. i must say the name of the restaurant threw us off a bit..we were thinking mexican cuisine..

but this place is actually more of a fusion-type spot with surprisingly complex flavors in their dishes. we ordered: gnocchi with a lamb sauce, grilled peppers with mozzarella and assorted vegetable platter (mostly grilled root vegetables) to begin. The peppers and mozz was my FAVORITE. such a simple dish but the way they made it was soo good.

for my meal I got the flank steak with chimichurri, fingerling potatoes and arugula. The dish was acceptable, didn't knock my socks off. I thought the chimichurri was too sparse and too dry. overall the dish could have used more flavor, i wish the steak was seasoned a bit more.

The menu is pretty limited, but the staff is willing to work with you to make sure you order something to suit your preferences. they were great!

They are a wine bar - I had a glass of delicious pinot noir. My co-workers had the malbec which i was told was good and also cocktails which they said were well made.

For desert I had their homemade sorbet in the following flavors: tangerine, pink grapefruit-mint and raspberry. holy cow...i am not crazy about grapefruit but the way they made it was delishhhh. Second place goes to the tangerine, followed by the raspberry sorbet - i'm assuming it's because of the texture of the fruit that the consistency varied so much for the sorbet...while it tasted good, i wasn't a fan of the texture of the raspberry.


overall, this place was delish. a must try for this area!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for at least 12 years. Every time I am in the Scottsdale area I always make it a point to visit Rancho Pinot Grill. One of my favorite restaurant period. And I travel all over and I am always in search of great food. I am never disappointed at RPG."}
{"text":"I am totally listening to the 80's Wild Wild West song while writing this review and it is totally perfect.  Travis makes an mean drink and wears a handle bar mustache and derby bartender hat.  The have wine flights which is a big positive plus wine on tap which is interesting to try.  The place is a little strange b/c it is cowboy/ranchy but the food is very modern and VERY GOOD.  It is a weird vibe.  Service was good too.  Crowd a little strange.  I had a country style pate that was complex and tasty.  We started with a pasta dish on their menu as an appetizer and a pork cheek ravioli.  The pasta on the menu was much better.  My favorite part of the meal was dessert.  We tried three and all were tasty.  I would say these are some of the better desserts in Scottsdale. I would not take out-of-town guests here, but the chef is very meticulous so I would probably go for a quiet dinner with the husband.  I would probably give it a 3.5 overall."}
{"text":"I loved my meal from the start! Let me tell people if they haven't been to Rancho Pinot for Dinner, well go now as this place has the most lovely food and service!! Down to Earth with Customers and love to serve you.
The Owner picks out veggies, dairy , meats, poultry and wonderful herbs! She works hard to make a tasty Menu.
I love in California and i will go back as this place in a MUST VISIT! 
And the Wine Selection as the owner is on top of it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me so long to visit an Arizona Institution that is worthy of so much praise. 

Squash Blossoms to start were melt in your mouth wonders of delight. Chef Chrysa said they were the last for a while due to the monsoon rains. We considered ourselves fortunate. 

Next came Noble Bread with a hint of Italian Cheese and incredible EVOO.  I saved room for California Halibut perfectly seasoned and appointed with thinly sliced squash, potatoes, radish with a subtle complementary sauce. I wanted to lick my plate...that dang good! 

Final touches were fresh peach & blueberry galette with house made \"cellos\"  - blood orange and Meyer lemon. Wonderful!  Thank you for a gastronomic enjoyable evening!!!  Did I mention they serve amazing local organic ROC2 coffee??? Thank you a million!  Sabrina you a grand!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met a friend there for dinner yesterday. We all loved it! The location is terrific with plenty of parking. The ambience of the restaurant is very welcoming and comfortable. The service was terrific. And the restaurant was actually quiet enough and the tables are far enough apart that we could actually have a conversation. The food was delicious. My husband had the grilled fish special, our friend had the pan-seared fish special and I had Nonni's Sunday Chicken. The chicken came with polenta cakes. I have never had polenta that I liked -until last night. We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"We found RP a couple months ago. Until Restaurant week, for sure a five star dinner. Sadly our experience this special week horrible! Sea Bass was so over cooked like in a rock. Neither were able to finish, went home to something quick.

We will try again when Salmon is on the menu. Not to make excuses but, white fish is extremely hard not to overcook in large quantities. The place was busy. Bass requires close attention and ours got far far away."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience at Rancho Pinot!  Ambiance is charming, food was delicious and service from Jillian was first class. The pan seared grouper was so juicy and flavorful and the gnocchi with lamb ragout was light and full of flavor. The strawberry shortcake was great but don't miss the date cake with toffee sauce!!
We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"great casual atmosphere and interesting food!    Chrysa Robertson and her gang do a great job with local and organic foods.

the lamb chops are succulent and savory.    also, you will never go wrong with the scallops when they have them.

\"mom's pecan bar\" with icecream is a great way to finish your meal.....and of course they have GREAT fresh roasted coffee"}
{"text":"We dined here for Valentine's Day and had a lovely time. The place itself has a southwestern upscale vibe. They added tables for the evening as they were booked solid, but it didn't feel overcrowded. 

We had an awesome server who was able to explain offerings, and suggested a Burrata salad to start, phenomenal with some beets, a vinaigrette and mozzarella to die for. 

We had a bottle of the Carpe Diem cab that was delicious. I had the Sea Bass -- I've never had Sea Bass, but it was delicious, and melted in your mouth. He had the Flank Steak with chimichurri ( a tradition for him since he was young at Rancho). My Sea Bass came with colored cauliflower that was well grilled and the lemon caper sauce was great. 

We split an espresso creme brule and I had an 18 yr Glenfidditch for dessert. 

Overall the meal and the service was phenomenal. The only reason it is not five stars is that I only eat fish, and I did not have very many options on the menu. Even the pastas (ravioli stuffed with short rib) and gnocchi with a lamb... also a risotto with prosciutto -- so that was the only disappointing part as I was looking forward to some pasta (they make it in house and their chef originates from Northern Italy.) 

Would definitely recommend for price, service, quality, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food AND service were OUTSTANDING!! Had the heirloom tomato and mozz special appetizer and linguini. Mom had lamb chops. We enjoyed every bite. Jillian gave EXCELLENT service. Worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner at Rancho Pinot with my boyfriend and liked it but I don't think I would return. The decor is very arizona/southwestern, with old timey pictures framed on the wall, postcard lampshades, and a big saguaro cactus skeleton in the center. There aren't a ton of vegetarian options but there is one entree, a couple of appetizers, and some sides. 

I ordered the vegetarian entree, Roasted Vegetables & Risotto Cake. It was nice to get a plate of different vegetables that I didn't have to chop or cook myself, and most of them were delicious. The risotta cake was just okay and seemed to me like average leftover risotta balled together and fried. My boyfriend had the braised berkshire pork, which the waiter described as a southwestern flavored deconstructed posole. My boyfriend said the pork was really tender but that the flavors weren't really pronounced. I had a cocktail with my dinner (a small cocktail menu but you can ask them to do whatever with the liquors they already have) and my boyfriend had a beer (they only had a few options but mostly all local brews). I was planning on ordering dessert but didn't see anything on the menu that interested me, which was a little disappointing. Our service seemed slow, as in it was a good 20 minutes after our plates were cleared and empty drink glasses taken away before our server came back to check on whether we wanted to see the dessert menu.

Overall Rancho Pinot just seems a little too expensive for what the experience and food is."}
{"text":"Food, service, price....all perfect.  The staff takes their job...and product ...very seriously. Love every bite.  Great room. Lots of space between tables.  Parking good.
MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE VALLEY.
Double love it."}
{"text":"A nice place.  A little hidden, but worth the search.   The service is excellent from the moment you walk in.  Try the watermelon salad to start.  I am not fond of watermelon and I enjoyed it.  The pork and swordfish are amazing.  The custard desert wasn't great, but the chocolate cake was tasty.  Also a nice bar.  The wine list was a little on the light side, but they had a decent selection."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a couple of years & thought I would dine here for Restaurant Week.  Went last night & service was meh. Food was mediocre. Overall not sure if it could have been better on a regular evening. The fact that I spent the amount I did per person, I could have spent my $ better at a different dining destination. 

I constantly hear great things from several people on social media, unfortunately that greatness did not play out for me.

I ordered the butternut salad which was good but not memorable, pork tenderloin which I think was a tad over cooked & the pear crisp was good for the first couple of bites but then the pears seemed way too firm and it was unenjoyable.

The chocolate cake was a stand-out for me & the only thing worth complementing."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre,  The main mahi tasted more of cumquat than fish and the process are extortionate.  The wine list was very limited, but we had a good French red.  The desserts were marginally better than the entrées.  The service was very good.  All in all, I wouldn't go there."}
{"text":"There are murmurings of inner house \"readjustments\" about to take place at Rancho Pinot, but if the end result of whatever is about to happen manages to maintain itself through the process, I think I've found a new favorite spot in the valley.

I have to admit, the name had no draw for me...Rancho Pinot, I imagined a cowboy mascot sucking wine from the bottle, with gaudy faux western decor. But what I found was not quite as such. Rancho Pinot hidden in the recessed back end of the borgata strip mall was hands down a great experience. The decor was in fact a little old school with sporadically placed cow skulls on the walls and the occasional lasso or bit and harness, as is obligatory with any location that contains the name Rancho in it, but as my lady (as picky as she is) exclaimed, it was very tastefully done, and I'd have to agree...it was oddly, an almost artistically appointed room...yes, they had a stuffed jackalope...but no, I'm not going to retract what I've said...it may not be hip decor, or stylish...but it is certainly tasteful. 

The service was top notch professional by what seemed to be mostly career servers, reserved enough to be elegant, casual enough to be fun... and you know your dealing with a rare breed, when you ask for recommendations and they don't in fact recommend the most expensive thing on the menu.

I started with the house cured duck prociutto, which was to die for, and finished off with the Nonni's Sunday Chicken...something of a house specialty as I understand it, passed down through the family, into the hands of Chef Chrissa (sp?) for your dining pleasure....and hot damn was it delicious, succulent, and memorable. The menu itself was contemporary, fresh, and locally realized...which I love...not at all the refried  bean southwestern fair I half feared walking into. Everything we had was, in short, inspired.

Their wine list though not for those on a budget, is well appointed and not surprisingly ripe with some mighty fine Pinots.

All restaurants want to be the place that receives the terrific review from the towns hot critics...I couldn't help but think that Rancho Pinot might be one of the places they go when they AREN'T working, as I noticed one of them sitting at the bar enjoying herself with friends....and in my book that's worth ten times more than any great one time review. 

*Jackalope = Mythical North American \"Critter\". A Jack rabbit with the antlers of a deer or antelope. Strange."}
{"text":"Owned by a husband and wife team.  Rancho Pinot's menu changes daily, depending on what's fresh.  Entres might include quail with soba noodles, rosemary-infused chicken with Italian sausage, and grilled sea bass atop basmati rice. Reservations essential."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Rancho Pinot in well over 10 years, so decided to revisit this past weekend.  We really enjoyed our dinner and can see why so many locals make this a regular stop on their dining list.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, the service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  We shared the ricotta gnocchi to start (yummy although could use a little more seasoning or flavor of the gnocchi themselves) along with a glass of sauvignon blanc and cabernet sauvignon (great choices!).  I had the Nonni's Sunday chicken and my husband had the steak...we both were very pleased with our flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation for a later time than I wanted for dinner through Open Table. I have a good friend who's a Concierge at a MAJOR hotel in Scottsdale who called to see if she could get me an earlier time for dinner. The owner not only was rude to the Concierge (not a smart move on a restaurants part, so much for getting ANY business from the Concierge) but the owner CANCELLED my reservation.
   I've traveled ALL over the world and eaten in many fine restaurants and NEVER have I had an owner or a restaurant CANCEL my reservation. I guess Rancho Pinot has SO MUCH business that they don't need any more!! As my Father used to say \"take a last look around because we're NOT coming back.\" There are SO many great restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale please choose one of them and don't go here!"}
{"text":"this is a nice restaurant bordering on fancy. the best thing I can say is about the natural, fresh selections on the menu and the decor which is old west, old cowboy and western movie-themed .the pictures on the wall inspired by old postcards, oil paintings and prints of the cowboy way of life are fantastic. the service was prompt, knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. the place was a bit formal for my taste, but it looked like couples, families and work parties would be very happy here. tucked in the back of strip mall of a busy road it's not easy to find..for a NY-er. but it was delicious. unfortunately the Chimichurri sauce was too strong for me and I did not feel well after all, but it was a joy to eat steak here for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Did I ever write about the time I left my ipad here?  Didn't realize for a couple of hours. Heart racing, I called, emailed, hoped it would be recovered. What gracious responses! I got an email early next morning, lots of reassurances, help for when/ how to pick up... Ok so I've reviewed this place before, key words are wonderful creative dishes, a light touch for subtle flavor (right now I'm having a delectable plate of greens, shaved herbs, summer squash wrapped around burrata--- who woulda thought?) but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here.  Oh.. And there's mightly fine wine on \"tap\". Heh heh.."}
{"text":"Firs timer a few weeks back for a celebration dinner...it's been here for ever and lived up to expectations.  Great food, super staff and a great evening out!!"}
{"text":"Had Dinner with my mom and husband on a Friday night at 7:30pm.
It was only about 1/2 full. 

Location: 
Tucked into a corner of a strip mall near Trader Joe's and Walgreens.

Decor/Ambiance:
Kitchy... Eclectic... Southwestern... Low lighting... White table cloth... Open setting, just tables no booths
Surprisingly quiet considering that it is a very open room
The kitchen is mostly open to the dining room although it's not easy to see what's going on exactly in there.

Service:
Tammy was wonderful... super sweet ... attentive without being overly so.

Wine:
They were offering wine flights (of 3 wines) for Chardonnay, \"Interesting Whites\", Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon.
I opted for the Pinot Noir and found that I liked 2 of the 3 very much!  
This is a really nice way to get a taste of a couple different wines without investing in a whole glass that you might not like ... or might not go with your dinner... or if you're like me and just like to taste different wines and don't want just 1.  :)

Food:
Awesome... everything we ate was perfectly prepared and presented.
Crusty bread offered was yummy... messy... but yummy.  :)

What we ordered:

Their salads are shareable sized... good for 2 people but we each got our own.

*Chopped Salad - seemed to have everything in it.... including grapes, apples, white cheddar ... totally going back to order this :)

*Fennel Salad - you have to like fennel... but it's not overpowering... 

*Beet Salad - SO Good!  It was red and gold beets on a bed of mixed greens with a light yogurt feta dressing.

*Asparagus (with Prosciutto and Egg) - This was shareable sized (all 3 of us had a good sampling size of this) ... the egg on top was something I'd not enjoyed before but I think it's my new favorite way of having grilled asparagus

*Galette (special of the day) - the pastry was a little dry but the savory insides made up for it.. and it was served with a mixed green side salad so I definitely got my greens in for the day  :)

*Grilled Quail - Succulent!  Absolutely D-lish!  Served on creamy polenta.  

*Grouper (fish) - husband didn't share but it looked really good

*Passion Fruit Sorbet - perfect palette cleanser... hit the sweet tooth spot but was not heavy nor overly sweet


Price: 
Not cheap... this is a nice evening out.  But being from Vegas, this place was very reasonable IMO for having wine, appetizers and dessert... the whole works. Our bill was about $60 pp (incl tax and tip)."}
{"text":"Great!  I had the zucchini blossoms stuffed with goat cheese, Nonni's Sunday chicken and the prickly pear sorbet.  The blossoms had been lightly breaded then fried yet had a very clean, yummy flavor.  I had to refrain from licking the bowl that had Nonni's boneless chicken thighs accompnied by toasted polenta triangles.  Dessert was the prickly pear sorbet which was heavenly light and accompanied by three different small cookies.  Service was excellent and we will return asap."}
{"text":"Now technically, I cannot give a full report on this place just yet. I went there just to enjoy a few drinks. I did like the fact that they offer the wine flights. And you can mix and match your varietals. It was a nice time to just relax and have some good wine. I will be back sometime to try the food because it looks healthy and sounds delicious."}

{"text":"First time in Scottsdale, AZ and what an experience with this place! Everything we ordered were over the top great. The presentation was appealing and the food tasted as good as it looked. 

The chef was truly creative and they have the most excellent service from the staff."}
{"text":"I ate here this week with 3 of my friends and we are all around 30 yrs old. The food was GREAT! And the menu was very unique, a total foodie menu. I had the pear, date, hazelnut, pomegranate, with some kind of cheese salad. It was Delicious!! I've been craving it ever since then! I also had the quail as my entree which was very good. We shared the plum and pear tart with caramel ice cream, soooo amazing! I would love to try more on their menu but I'm not sure ill be returning because of the atmosphere. It is very western and not in a fun way. The reason I mentioned our ages before is because this is definitely a place for an older crowd. If you want a quiet dinner with an exciting menu then I recommend it. If you want a fun lively pretty dinner, go elsewhere. This place would be 5 stars if they gave it a makeover!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, great wine recommendation. The dinners were perfect - pork and lamb. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner at Rancho Pinot tonight. The food, service and comfortable ambience made it a perfect dinner. The evening specials included a brightly colored cold beet soup, which was simply outstanding. I also had a meticulously-made green salad with Little Gem lettuce, colorful shaved radish and Maytag Blue cheese. If there is one pet peeve of mine in many of today's restaurants it is that salads are a complete afterthought. That's not the case at Rancho Pinot. The salad greens are fresh, perfectly dressed, and the shaved radish thoughtfully placed on the plate. The Maytag blue cheese was perfect for this salad. I ordered the grilled lamb chops with white beans and frisée for my entree. The lamb was cooked perfectly and was served with a mint pesto. I'll be making my way back to Rancho Pinot soon!"}
{"text":"Simply one of, if not, the best restaurant in the Phoenix area.  There is a reason that Rancho Pinot has been around for over 20 years. It is hard to find dishes with such great ingredients, with so much thought and skill put into them.  Rancho Pinot is such a welcoming, comfortable restaurant, with great service.  Those who need to be fawned upon, complain a lot, and are used to chain restaurants may not understand a place like this, but anyone with a bit of knowledge of quality and passion for food, will love it.  I didn't realize some locals were so important that they needed a concierge to try and alter their dinner reservations. Maybe all the early reservations 
were taken by other non entitled guests.   I hope RP continues for many years to come."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for dinner.  Nice kinda kitchy Arizona/cowboy decor to the restaurant.  The salami and crostini appetizer was a good start.  I liked the salami and the burrata cheese the best.

For dinner I had the jidori chicken which had nice spices.  My friend had the bass which was a little over cooked.

For dessert we had the olive oil cake which was nice and moist.  The meyer lemon curd gave it some zip.

We noticed the cheese selections on the dessert menu and they looked good.  Next time we might want to choose a couple of these as an appetizer."}
{"text":"I live in the area and enjoy having dinner here. The servers are excellent, always checking back to be sure everything is just as you ordered. The lamb chops are my favorite, cooked perfectly and served with beans that have so much flavor and garlic. You are never rushed and the atmosphere is relaxing. I suggest a reservation on the weekends."}
{"text":"Service, food, and one hell of a wine selection make Rancho Pinot a 4 star restaurant... We went in on a Thursday night with no reservation or expectations, and we were pleasantly surprised (even my extremely picky boyfriend). 
Hoke (not sure on the spelling of his name) was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.  He educated us on the history of the restaurant - 14 years in business, pointed out the husband and wife owners, and of course upsold us on the wine and entree selection.  By no means were we disappointed.  Considering he's been there since 1999, we figured we'd trust his judgement.
We started out with the gnocci appetizer.  It came with a unique meat sauce.  Fresh bread and olive oil complimented the appetizer.  I went with the sea bass entree and my boyfriend had the duck special of the evening.  Both were filling and left us without room for dessert.
If you are looking for a low key evening without having to deal with Scottsdale snooty attitude, go visit Hoke at Rancho Pinot."}
{"text":"Sad to say it, but Rancho Pinot is a dark shadow of its former self. My wife and I used to eat here regularly. The place was outstanding in every way. Then two years ago we endured a horrific meal and decided to give RP a long rest. We returned for my birthday recently and decided that we would have fared better had we stayed away.

All of Rancho Pinot's formerly exciting, vibrant, and personable atmosphere is gone. We were greeted very curtly and seated with little to no discussion. Our server was friendlier but still not of the engaging nature to which we'd grown accustomed here.

The food? Just so-so and VERY salty. Grilled seafood salad is still tasty but the paltry mass of protein on the plate was a crime considering the price. Our pan-roasted fish entrees were nicely cooked but also quite small and way too high in sodium content. The wine selection is good and prices are low.

Wish I could have written a better review, but honestly, what you read here accurately represents our experience. We currently do not plan to return."}
{"text":"One of my top 5 restaurants in the Valley. Every time I've been there, service has been impeccable, the food amazing. Most recent visit....had the chopped salad which was perfect. I had the Braised Berkshire Pork, and it was intensely flavorful. Nice martini, too (the house gin is Plymouth, my favorite martini gin). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The ambiance in the restaurant is casual and rustic Western. It has a comfortable open atmosphere to give diners plenty of space. The staff is so friendly, they practically greet you in the parking lot! Well actually, we were waiting for 3 guests and our waitress, Jillian, did head outside to greet and usher them in. And a hug on the way out was not due to an overabundance of wine at our dinner, but just because she was so delightful!

Of the three dining experiences we had in Scottsdale this trip, Rancho Pinot served up the best food. Our incredible meal began with their Crispy Stuffed Squash Blossoms filled with ricotta herb filling and served with a tomato vinaigrette. Squash Blossoms are few and far between on menus as their availability is limited and one must know what to do with them. These were absolutely divine!

Our main entrees were their famous Nonni's Sunday Chicken, (one bite tells you why it has remained a favorite for so long as it was succulent and delicious!) Grilled Lamb Chops (a great presentation and I loved the accompaniments to the perfectly medium rare grilled chops) and the Vegetable Plate (forget relinquishing vegetarians to a sad plate of uninteresting veggies -this dish was so stunning, I was seriously jealous that I didn't order it myself!)  

Too full? Not a chance as we ordered two luscious desserts - Ice Cream Sundae studded with what seemed like chunks of bread pudding and an Old Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake, worthy of a few extra pounds. UNCLE! I surrender!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was very good, the service far below what would be expected at a fine dining restaurant.  Not 2 minutes after ordering our food, not even enough time to enjoy our drinks, our appetizer arrived.  And then again, 2 minutes after the appetizer plates were cleared our entrees arrived.  I then asked to speak to the manager (owner/chef was not there).  The manager was defensive, rude, first blaming me - I should have known the burrata comes out quickly and I should have told the server I did not want to be rushed, and finally, telling us that is how the owner wants the food served (the table next to us was not served at the same pace). She made no effort to apologize or to make things right.  She probably went to the United Airlines school of customer service.  We finished our meal in about 40 minutes - no way to enjoy an evening out.  It was a Thursday night, the restaurant was about 2/3 full."}
{"text":"I know that I Yelped Rancho before, but when something continues to be excellent, I want to chime in again.  Chef Chrysa's food is pure, locally sourced and wonderfully presented.  This hasn't changed for as long as we have been going there to celebrate either very special occasions or just because the sun came up....it is stellar either way. Last night, I had a very simply elegant Two Wash chicken with spinach and roughly mashed potatoes. Superb.  Crispy skin, moist succulent meat. Peg had a pasta dish which I adored as well. Sabrina was our guide and her experience and table-side manner is just so customer-friendly it is legendary. She knows the menu and food inside and out..always a plus. We dearly love Jillian as well...and it is a treat to be taken care of by her. She is also a wonderful guide and such a gracious host!  If you have not tried this place, or even if you have and it may have been a while, I would strongly recommend a visit/re-visit.  This place rocks!!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this restaurant.

It is extremely over-priced, over-seasoned, and over-indulgent.

The decor makes absolutely no sense. 

The food is local and the chef chooses in season dishes. Maybe Winter just wasn't my season. 

I don't think I would go back to try it again. The waiter we had seemed miserable and completely disinterested in whether we enjoyed our dining experience.

Let me tell you my bill was $90 for 3 appetizers and 2 drinks. No entrees excited me and the desserts were extremely strange."}
{"text":"I have to say I really loved this restaurant. The food was great. I got the signature dish, Nonni's chicken & it was delicious. So tender with a fried polenta cake. The squash blossoms were amazing too! I loved the decor & the people were very friendly. If you're ever in the area check it out. It's kind of hidden, but that's what makes it a gem."}
{"text":"Another trip to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Another mediocre eating experience.  My review is based on only 1 visit, but I won't be going back again, so 1 will have to do.

Went out to eat here based on the recommends of Yelpers and also we had already eaten at the one other high recommend mid-priced joint around (Cowboy Ciao - see my other review and eat there instead!)

- 1 Star - Parking.  Sure, it's not their fault that the parking lot is a big ole mess under construction.  But to have to walk from several buildings away, though dust etc etc was not the prelude to a cheery meal. 
- 1 Star - Greeting at door.  There was no one at the waitstand, and a passing waitress gave us a surly - \"She'll be here when she can\".  When the seating lady did come up (20 seconds later), she was nice, but the mood was bruised.
+ 1 Star - Server.  Our server was a lovely man - looked a bit like an old school butler!  He did mess up once and forget to bring my friend's 2nd beer, but it came so fast that it was quickly forgiven.  He also traded my cocktail (which I didn't like - although I gave it the ole try!) for a glass of wine.  Sweet man, gentle demeanor, good waiter.
- 1 Star - Decor.  Okay, I get what you all are going for with this sort of kitchy western theme.  But the size of the room is too big and open and so the attempt at intimacy just felt.... cheezy.  And why the \"appeal to the masses\" decor and then white linens?  A bit confused, imo.
+ 1 Star - Creative, interesting menu.  The menu is short but sweet.  Some interesting choices ranging from scallops to steak to pasta.  But...
-1 Star - The food.  We began with the asparagus appetizer which was fantastic.  Very French but with an American twist of frying the egg and whatever tasty breadcrumb chunks those were.  But the entrees.  Not good.  My scallops were overcooked and the cabbage on which they lay was just a mushy paste.  The cabbage had a good taste, but the texture.... Ick.  My partner had the pasta which was made with several seafoods (different than the online menu).  Just not good.  Not inedible, but not worth eating and especially not for $18.

I would not eat here again.  There are too many other places in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  This was just not worth it."}
{"text":"This place for sure did not live up to the yelp hype, at least in my opinion. Perhaps my expectations were misplaced, but I sort of expected some version of a \"small town authentic hip restaurant with fresh locally inspired and creative dishes and trendy atmosphere\" - the type of gem I am always searching for when on vacation in, ughm, small towns. Rancho Pinot turned out to be none of those things. My first clue was that it was in fact in the middle of a shopping plaza. My second clue was the wave of chlorine smell strong enough to knock you off your feet that hit me upon entering this establishment. Not what I want to smell in a restaurant. Oh well, at least I know they have thoroughly cleaned their kitchen. The décor is dated, incongruent with the cuisine (is it a ranch? is it italian? is it American? I don't know, and neither does the designer who put it together, evidently) and overall uninspiring. Especially the old carpet on the floor, the color of which could not be reliably determined at this time. The food was ok. An appetizer salad was actually quite good and interesting. I ordered  lamb chops for my main and the server didn't ask me how I wanted them done. I was curious how they'd come out, lo and behold they came out as an array of options  - one chop was medium and others more well done, with one being really well done. All tasted quite delicious. The service was good and fast. Overall, Ranco Pinot just doesn't have what makes a solid restaurant the IT restaurant. It is decisively average."}
{"text":"Tried this place after seeing online reviews. It's in a upscale strip shopping center off of Scottsdale road near Lincoln.
It reminds me of Heirloom in DC Ranch. A strong emphasis on local, fresh ingredients, but they have been doing it long before it was hip. 
Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. The food was fantastic. I had the shredded pork, my wife had the salmon appetizer and salmon entree as well. All were delicious and well prepared. 
I would highly recommend the green peppers side. Some are spicy, some are not. It's a guessing game as to which are which."}
{"text":"Not child friendly!! We went to dinner tonight as a request from my 8 year old. We take our children to fine dinning restaurants to experience the service, and enjoy conversation. We have always been welcomed with our two children and complimented on their manners. (People are amazed how well they enjoy dinner without screens) When we made the reservation we indicated that we'd have a child with us. The restaurant was kind in saying they could get us in at 530, this was perfect. We understand that not everyone likes children and go early out of respect for other patrons. As we were waiting for food my son was playing with the plastic candle (picked up to see how it works). Instead of helping out and bringing bread to suffice a child. The owner stomped over and ripped the candle out of my child's hand! How insulting and demeaning to the next generation!

The food was mediocre at best. We ordered the lamb chops with mint pesto. The pesto was nothing more than chopped mint. My son enjoyed the ravioli and would have wanted another order. However, he was concerned that the \"women expediting\" was giving him mean looks. It's sad that the owner didn't just deny our reservation if she truly didn't like children. We gladly would have went elsewhere. I DO NOT recommend this restaurant. There are many amazing restaurants in the area.

{"text":"First, I can't believe they've been hiding there for 18 years and we've never found them....until now!  What a treat for our last night in Scottsdale.  We were welcomed at the door and the host had actually read our reservation comment on OpenTable!  What a pleasant surprise.  We had a table in the corner where we could enjoy the entire restaurant as it filled to the brim for dinner.  Our waiter was outstanding; the perfect blend of attentiveness, knowledge, and fun.  I didn't see one of the cocktails on the night's menu that I'd seen on the website, so asked the bartender to surprise me with something \"gingery\".  He did not disappoint. Not sure what all I was drinking, but it was delightful!  We started by sharing the Chanterelle & Fried Egg salad.....sounded a bit strange, but what a heavenly dish.  Rich with flavor and texture.  I opted for the Jidori Chicken and my spouse, the Braised Berkshire Port \"posole style\".  Both were well prepared, and extremely interesting...in a very good way!  Based on other reviews, we ordered the Sauteed Shishito Peppers, which truly made every bite a surprise, and we almost licked the platter clean.  The Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Bacon were amazing as well.  And just when we thought we'd had enough....we had to try dessert!   Mom's Honey Pecan Square was a hit....but my favorite was the pink grapefruit mint sorbet!  A perfect ending to a perfect meal!  When we were leaving, the host asked about our experience and engaged in some delightful banter, which just completed the night.  Next year, we just might start our Scottsdale vacation at Rancho Pinot!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Rancho Pinot for over 20 years and I have never been disappointed. It may in fact be my overall favorite restaurant anywhere. I do not live in the Phoenix but I always plan my visits to the area so that I can dine at least once at the restaurant. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The menu is creative using local ingredients. The wine list is awesome with lots of affordable options. What more could you want!"}
{"text":"We went there because it was highly recommended by a few people we met while out here.. and boy were we glad we did! Everything we ordered was amazing.. so fresh light and flavorful.. definitely recommend you try it!! 
We ordered the antipasto dish as an appetizer along with another special of the day salad. The short rib ravioli (another special) and the lamb chops.. we literally licked all the plates.. such amazing tasting food..  we tried the watermelon mojitos.. Deliish!!! And finally for desert we got the strawberry shortcake.. again it's did not disappoint.. excellent food, super cute restaurant and really attentive and helpful staff."}
{"text":"It's dangerous having an office located in downtown Scottsdale. The proximity to restaurants and watering holes can easily lead to lengthy lunches and copious amounts of cocktails. Now that Rancho Pinot has added a weekday lunch menu, I fear my productivity level just dropped. 

Although it seems this place has fallen off the foodnik radar, the stellar Arizona-accented cooking is still earning the \"5-STARS\" awarded by the Republic. A delectable new lunch menu makes it even more accessible.  

Heading inside, you'll see that kitsch is king.

Imagine cowboys, comics, saguaro ribs, and white table cloths. It's a dreamy culture clash of whimsy to match the eclecticism of the cuisine. 

Brandishing his bola tie, bartender Travis Nass is on a mission to elevate the city's cocktail scene. He makes his own... well... everything. His bar is stocked little vials and vessels (pictured) containing homemade concoctions and bartender essentials. 

His perfect Manhattan provoked this tweet to @kkrader, \"I had a cocktail today that made me quiver. That good, or I just had the alchy shakes. I'm ok w either.\" 

Add in lunch from Chef Chrysa and I'm still shaking."}
{"text":"Came here for my best friend's birthday as it's her 2nd fav restaurant after Stonehorse in Tulsa.  She knows the owners, so we figured this would be the perfect choice. We clearly didn't need a reservation as the place was almost empty when we entered.  I was joking around with the host telling him I'm quite the yelper and that was I going to review his restaurant. 

We were waiting on two more coming from the airport, so the server nicely came over to tell us that we needed to make sure we had the order in by 10.  We went ahead and ordered wine and appetizers, which it took the waiter quite some time to figure out that we may have wanted to order some apps before the last two arrived.

The food arrived and I had the lamb.  It was not so delightful nor memorable.  The grain was dry and the lamb was overcooked (more like medium as opposed to med-rare).  I was not impressed.  

At the end of the meal, apparently the server asked the person who paid if he meant to leave that tip.  It may *not* have been enough, but if you have any sort of class in my opinion, you shouldn't ask your customer if that's what they meant to leave."}
{"text":"We literally took an entire day from our trip to Sedona to make a pit stop for dinner at Rancho Pinot. To say it's good is an understatement. Everything is done with love and a passion for quality food.

The service was over the top fabulous, the honey rosemary butter was to die for, and they make their Moscow mules with Bundaberg ginger beer! 

Besides the little things like the delicious butter,  the entire meal from start to finish was incredible. I cannot say enough good things about this place. The flavors in each dish were well balanced, and my steak was cooked just right.  

To top it all off the panna cotta I had for dessert was one of the tastiest I've ever had!"}
{"text":"They just opened for lunch this week - outstanding!  The heirloom white bean soup was really great, as were the lemon kale salad and shaved lamb sandwich.  Ww will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Made reservations here for a work event a few months ago after our boss had heard the rave reviews about the restaurant. The staff was very great to work with, and the night went off without a hitch. 

Like others have noted, it's in an unsuspecting strip mall tucked away in the corner. But once you get inside, it feels very small town and homey, which was nice. We started the evening with a few glasses of wine before we started with our meal. For the salad, I had the Tuscan Kale and Escarole sandwich, which was pretty good. Not anything breathtaking but tasty. For the main course I had the Nonni's Sunday Chicken, which was again good, but not amazing. I think I just wasn't a fan of chicken thighs. For dessert I had Mom's Honey Pecan Square, which was DELIGHTFUL. I think the sum of all the parts, company, service, quality, made this a 4-star experience, but I would probably try something different on my next visit."}
{"text":"from 2011 -- Rancho Pinot never fails to deliver. The ambiance is classy, yet comfy. The service -- knowledgeable but friendly. and the food? well, it speaks for itself. whether starting with goat cheese stuffed squash blossoms topped with cherry tomatoes and arugula, or eating the lamb with lemon and beans, the food is fresh, inventive and wholly satisfying.
this past weekend we sat at the bar and have skilled mixologist Travis make us a prickly pear manhattan. stellar! after the above-mentioned squash blossoms, we both had the nightly special -- a frisee and spinach salad, tossed in a sherry vinaigrette, with arizona lobster mushrooms, duck confit, crispy matchstick potatoes and a fried egg from Chef Chrysa Robertson's own chickens. topped off the meal with a new dessert -- a roasted banana/rum milkshake accompanied by two homemade peanut butter/chocolate chip cookies. heavenly!
rancho is a well-established restaurant in phoenix, with a mostly well-established crowd. however, younger foodies from all over the valley shouldn't keep from flocking here for the fresh, seasonal, expertly crafted food. wine list is great, cocktails are inventive and service is exactly what you would expect for an establishment of this quality."}
{"text":"We go here several times a year and are continually amazed by the flavor profiles and creativity with which Rancho endows standard dishes.  That hasn't changed.  But ...

Prices are higher and have begun to affect the value proposition.  And I was not pleased when the server refused my request to make a half portion of the Gnocci as an appetiser (it used to be on the appetiser menu, and was their best in that category).  It's pasta! You should be able to make a half portion.  And the scallops were somewhat sandy.  Don't make me hunt for a new #1 restaurant in Scottsdale, Rancho.  It would just be too sad."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us for dinner. The server suggested and we took her up on a very nice 1.5 bottle of cab. Killed it. She suggested another winner killed that too. I had the lamb chops. Not only were they prepared good they were excellent quality to start with. Wonderful place. Tip: go soon as they will change location in May 2916."}
{"text":"Just had a lovely meal to celebrate our anniversary. We've been coming to RP for many years and have always enjoyed it, but tonight was exceptional. It happens to be Restaurant Week and options available beautifully highlight the menu. We love the quirky cowboy decor and the restaurant is never too noisy even when full.  It's a great romantic spot, yet appropriate for business entertaining as well. Tonight, being Monday, was especially quiet, with a few regulars at the bar. Background music was fun. Our waitperson was attentive and knew the food. Oh yeah, now to the food....

If squash blossoms are available, get them. Best ever, period. Perfectly stuffed with goat cheese, crispy, and set off with a bit of arugula and tomato salad.

From the restaurant week menu, we started with the watermelon salad. So refreshing, with baby greens, mint and feta, but then a bit of black olive, red onion shavings, and pine (?) nuts in a sherry vinaigrette. What a perfect explosion of flavor!

I had the brown grouper with leeks, asparagus and kumquat relish. Hubs had the grilled pork tenderloin. I could have licked the plate. Portions were just right (I'm perplexed by other reviews to the contrary, and will bite my tongue so I won't be unkind, but those folks should stick with chain restaurants, nuff said).

Desserts were OK...lemon verbena pudding and strawberry shortcake. From other visits, I would get the sorbet from the regular menu if you are a dessert person.

We had a glass of sparkling wine (Shaumberg?) and WillaMcKenzie(?) Pinot Gris, both very light and refreshing. I'm no wine guru, but the list is interesting and different

Especially with the restaurant week prix fix menu pricing, the price is reasonable, and even from the regular menu, appropriate for the food quality and Scottsdale location.  Hubs and I agreed that we won't wait for our next anniversary to come back. This local gem deserves our frequent business!"}
{"text":"The food here is made to order and always with fresh ingredients. Today I was disappointed that they did not have Noble bread and they did not have the rosemary butter please please bring this back. When you go here and have dessert get the Date cake you won't be disappointed at all so yummy."}
{"text":"Every time and yes, I mean every time... I have dined at Rancho Pinot the service is flawless.  Their wine list is extensive and the staff volunteers to decant... yes, it's true! 
Obviously, they truly want you to enjoy your evening.  The menu is local, fresh, and fairly expansive.  AIbeit sorely tempted, I try not to order grilled lamp chops lamb every visit.  This 
last visit, I lightened up my post holiday plate and tried their DIVER SCALLOPS mesquite grilled, corn risotto, tomato broth, bacon-fennel relishwithout a single regret
My approach to dining... make it count.  I am a foodie and proud of it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great and smart food, make a stop here. Cool atmosphere, wonderful and friendly service, delicious food and awesome wine. I had the house made pate=awesome then the quail small plate. Cooked to perfection and very flavorful. Enjoyed the Ano Verde Pinot Noir with both...oh so good. Lovely and truly talented service and a must when in the PHX or Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Always impeccable service. Excellent wine list.  Delicious food and desserts. 

Food is always made from fresh, locally grown ingredients.  So while you're enjoying a phenomenal meal, you can take comfort in knowing that your spinach wasn't picked by an 11 year old in Chile.  Then shipped on a CO2 coughing cargo ship to Long Beach. Then driven on smog spitting 18-wheeler to Scottsdale. 

Food is consistently 4 1/2 star quality, as is the wine list.

If it weren't for the slightly kitschy, Gilbert Ortega-ish decor (jackalope included), I'd almost give the place 5 stars."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great food in Scottsdale this is the place. Service is excellent and a wonderful wine selection."}
{"text":"So after sitting for 30 min, the service is horrible, if u wanna pay for 39 dollArs for steak. So don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Out of this world combinations, start to finish. Each and every night is a surprise. Love the veggies. So creative."}
{"text":"Two words....craft cocktails.  Mixed by Travis. 

To be honest, I have not eaten here, but the food looks and smells amazing.  And by the looks of things, this place is a crowd pleaser! 

If you are a fan of classic cocktails, made with high quality liquors, and a touch of mixology obsession.....this is your local Scottsdale place.  Stop in. Tell Travis what you like.  You won't leave disappointed (or stone sober)."}
{"text":"My wife took her parents here last week. They loved the food and very thoughtful service. Items they had were beet salad, gnocchi with a ragu, roasted fish and Nonna's chicken. The server was also very knowledgeable about the wine list. I was not present and am writing this review based on my wife's narrative. We have plans to go back soon so that I can get the experience. Wife and I live in Northern VA."}
