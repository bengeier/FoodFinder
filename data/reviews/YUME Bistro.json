{"text":"I had my second visit today and i have to say it was great, this place is good.

Firstly I would like to thank the owners, they really make this place a nice place to visit, they are both very friendly and will make sure everything is good.

My first visit i had the Shoyu Ramen it was good, while not my favorite style of noodles the soup and all the toppings were really good. The noodles were good and suited the Ramen, me preferring other noodles is not a fault in Yume's good food.

The second visit, i tried the Thai Curry Ramen, it was a perfect level of spice and overall a great dish. A little different but it worked well and a nice coconut Thai curry sauce.

Overall a great addition to the area and i will be going back for the Shio Ramen or the Kimchi very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Hadn't had ramen since my college days....absolutely delicious and no comparison! The pork belly bao was awesome. The chef tweaked a ramen vegetarian dish for my parents - the flavors were incredible. Don't miss out - try the red bean and sesame ice creams! Only negative is that they only have 7 tables. The owners were very sweet, and the other employee was enthusiastic and excellent with his recommendations."}
{"text":"the taste is okay, but way more expensive in relative to its value. The staff is very friendly and nice. I ordered their top one on the menu for noodle, there's not a lot of noodle and meat, so I feel both quality and quantity is fair, perhaps below my expectation."}
{"text":"Stopped in and very pleasantly surprised!

Small and quaint restaurant that has a very good offering of Ramen noodles and other Japanese dishes. Fresh, home made Ramen noodles, fresh Uni (when it comes in), Miso Tako (octopus), and the BBQ Pork Belly Bao were simply delicious. 

Toni and Rosanna recently moved here from San Francisco's East Bay and have established a perfect little niche for outstanding Japanese fare. The soup broth is traditional style, made lovingly from pork bones and takes over 20 hours of cooking that is the base for their Ramen dishes. Fresh and simple ingredients make for a genuine foré into Japanese cooking prepared with finesse and care.

 You will be pleasantly surprised, and I highly recommend you stop in and sample this wonderful Ramen Noodle shop."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best ramen in Charlotte.  Majorly Authentic!!!   Hands down 5 stars.  The pork broth is super savory and zesty since it's been simmering for over 20 hours.  The chasu pork is fatty and extremely tender, the best I've had- vs. places in LA (Little Tokyo) or  Manhattan.  The texture of the ramen noodle is perfectly el dente - chewy.  Aside from the ramen, their ahi poke is fantastic.   If you come and see people waiting outside, it's absolutely worth the wait.

On top of the food, the owners are great people, friendly and provide the homestyle experience."}
{"text":"This place is one of three amazing, authentic Japanese restaurants in Charlotte! Absolutely loved the food! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great little place. I had the tonkatsu spicy miso ramen was delicious...tastes like the one my wife had in japan. The negitoro donburi was very tasty and delicate. It was a great find. The owners are great as well. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is different from your typical Japanese restaurant.  Definitely try all you can from their menu and don't forget their daily specials!  Ramen bowls were filling, just wish the pork wasn't 90% fat, but still tasty.  Make sure you break the eggs and mix the yolk into the broth :)  

Appetizers were yummy and make sure you pair your ramen up with their ramen sets to get a nice deal for trying out the apps.  A bit expensive, but overall, we left satisfied and full.  Owners were super sweet and attentative to everyone.  Will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Very happy to finally find a great ramen place near Charlotte. The broth was complex and rich, and the additional toppings gave each bite a new flavor down to the last spoonful--or in my case, the last slurp with the bowl at my lips. The soft-boiled, marinated egg was a perfect texture and definitely one of my favorite parts of the meal. My only suggestion would be to grill or sear pork belly before serving.

The atmosphere is casual but the ramen is classy. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. Well done, YUME!"}
{"text":"True Japanese curry and ramen! Try the katsu! This is the only play I have found so far that has good Japanese curry"}
{"text":"Chawanmushi is the only dish that acceptable. The Katsu is too thinly sliced and dry. The consistency of the ramen is too soft (taste is ok). I could barely find the Tako in the takoyaki. I am sorry to say that Musashi is still my go to for Japanese food."}
{"text":"This place brings back great memories for my husband and I. Our favorite restaurant, before moving to NC, was a little Korean place owned and operated by a husband and wife. Yume Bistro is small but comfortable, and the owners/staff make you feel as though you are guests for dinner in their own home. They're serving up some great Japanese food here.

We ordered the vinegared cucumbers, veg dumplings, and seaweed salad for starters. All three dishes had great flavor. I only got one dumpling, because my husband cleaned the plate in two minutes. For mains, we ordered the veg curry and kimchi ramen bowl. The veg curry had a great Indo-inspired flavor, with just the right amount of kick. The kimchi ramen bowl was spicy, but that's how my husband likes it. The owner talked us through the menu at our table, and he was more than happy to make our meals all vegetarian, including broths and oils. 

We will absolutely be back and look forward to bringing meat-eating friends and family with us."}
{"text":"Fantastic ownership! Food is very good and fresh. Love the extra spicy noodle bowls. Small and intimate but worth the visit if you Re into noodle bowls."}
{"text":"We are big fans of this place. While I'm not quite sure if this is going to be better than whatever you've had in Little Tokyo, the ramen is pretty delicious! My favorite is the Thai Curry. We also really like the poke (it's spicy!)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night dinner and although it was close to closing time, they were very accommodating. My husband ordered Ramen while I ate the dumplings & Japanese chicken. My boys also enjoyed mini bowls of ramen. Everything came out hot & seasoned well. The staff was very friendly & checked on us quite often. They did even make suggestions on how to flavor the ramen with additional items on the table. Prices were reasonable, especially for kids, when you're able to add small portions to an adult meal for $2-$3. Completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!! I had the tonkotsu miso ramen and ended up finishing the whole thing. The flavor was so good and that egg...mmm! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I am so happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"Drove here yesterday and so disappointed that it's no longer there. Did they relocate??"}
{"text":"Iv'e eaten many homemade Japanese meals and I have to say that this place went above and beyond my expectations. Their Katusdon was full of flavor, from the onions, to the Pork Cutlet and very well cooked rice... all of the ingredients complimented one another to give it the authenticity it deserved.

One of my favorites out of the entire menu was the Takoyaki. Words can't describe how well cooked the takoyaki here was. Every bite I took from start to finish tasted just as good as the first and the presentation of the meals were spot on!

The service is wonderful, and all of the items my group ordered came out superb. Looking forward to being a regular here! I recommend this spot to anybody looking for good, and authentic Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Miso ramen was okay. Chicken and pork Katsu with rice was much better than ramen. Not a fan of broth they make over there. Too salty for me.  Everything was a lot pricy.  $13 for a bowl of ramen?  Hum...

The place is tiny and service was okay. I never got my water and waited a long time to pay our bills. A good place to visit once in a while."}
{"text":"love the authenticity of this place! takoyaki, ramen, gyoza so delicious and flavor is spot-on. pricey but the politeness and friendliness of the staff outshines. i have taken friends here to eat and they love it, family loves it too. portion is large, you will go home very full and happy."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, this place has filled a void in my culinary life! One of the best katsu curries I've had and the ramen was great!"}
{"text":"I have been needing to write this review for a long long time. YUME is a special place. It starts with the owners: Tony and Rosena. They are the head chef and front of staff. They are also super wonderful people who are very kind. It's hard to find service like you find here. They make you feel like you're at home eating a cozy home cooked meal ( aside from the fact that the closest thing I have to ramen at home is Maruchan.)

Anyways, onto the food. The food is quite out of this world. (More like this city. Tony and Rosena came from SF and they brought some very much needed ramen to the Charlotte scene.) Pretty much all of the dishes here shine. It's hard to go wrong with anything. 

For starters, drinks are pretty standard. Just a heads up, they come in cans. But aside from that, consider getting the Iced Matcha Green Tea. It's made in house and it's dang good. However, I'd take it as a dessert rather than a complement to your meal. 

I've tried two donburis there. Negitoro Don and the Pork Katsu Don. I wasn't the biggest fan of the negitoro because it was a lot of raw fish. Tuna, rice, soy sauce, and red onions. Delicious but hard to eat in one setting. For a solo meal, I'd recommend the Pork Katsu Don. It's delicious. Tastes just like I was in Japan again. My brother is a japanese curry fanatic; he also said it was delish. 

Appetizers: 
Chawanmushi: My friend got this on a whim. It's a soup style dish and surprisingly good. It's very comforting and perfect for a rainy day. It's mild in flavor. I'd say it's similar to miso soup but quite eggy. 
Takoyaki: Best takoyaki I've had in Charlotte. Second best to the one I got in Japan. The flavors are pretty similar to authentic takoyaki in japan! Not too sweet. Not too salty! 
Pork Gyoza...great gyoza. But then again, it's hard to go wrong with it. Crunchy in the right places and yet juicy as well. 
Kakuni Bun...easily my most favorite appetizer. The bun was wonderfully soft and complements the meat perfectly. The sauce also adds a nice bit of flavor. It could be a little dry on the edges but overall, it's a great dish. 
Yume Hamachi...an easy second to the Kakuni bun. it's a simple dish but packed with tons of flavor. hamachi, ponzu, jalapenos, and cilantro make a really fresh but complex-flavored dish. 
Agedashi tofu...This one was a shocker. I'm not a tofu fan. I like meat but this was surprisingly flavorful. Very juicy as well. 
Karaage chicken...fried chicken. you can't go wrong with this. it's more popcorn chicken than chicken wings. it's good on rice too. 

Ramen: All excellent. They all are very different and very comforting. I don't want to go into specifics because I really think you need to try them all if you can just because they're each an experience. However, I can rank them from my absolute favorite, down. But I suggest getting whatever sounds the best to you. Consider looking at the lunch combos as well. 
1. Spicy Miso (the corn makes it) 
2. Miso (again, corn)
3. Shoyu (a little saltier than Miso)
4. Thai Curry
5. Korean Kimchi

You honestly can't go wrong with this menu. If I had to pick, definitely the Kakuni Bun, Hamachi, the Spicy Miso Ramen. Wash it down with the Iced Green Matcha for dessert! 

Don't forget to take a look at their ice cream menu. It's different and delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for dinner and it was great!! We ordered the Kimchi and tonkotsu ramen. They were delicious!! We also got the Hawaiian ahi poké and the pork belly bun for appetizers. This place definitely knows what the best food to make is because it really hit the spot! We plan on coming back and trying everything on the menu for sure! It was a drive but a well worth one! I can tell it's a family owned and I love it! Tastes home cooked!"}
{"text":"Very good ramen, and the poke reminded me of Hawaii.  I just wish it was fresh not thawed tuna.

Great service, the cook came out to talk with me about the food.  
I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Japanese cuisine I've ever had and with no doubt the best restaurant in my area. The Tonkotsu Spicy Miso Ramen is the best dish I've had in any restaurant ever and it is 100% authentic. The seaweed actually tastes like the setting of the ocean. Quite surprising to have such a feeling of a specific sensation just from eating a food. The kimchi is actually made by them and not even comparable to the kimchi I buy at the nearby Asian Market. It takes 45 days just to make one jar of it. This amount of work into meticulous toppings of food is only seen in the most famous restaurants around. The ramen costs about 15 dollars and the serving size is impressive. Even I, a young hungry guy, can't finish a bowl of it without feeling uncomfortably full. An interesting appetizer I had recently was their seasoned baby octopus which was very delicious despite its bizzare taste for westerners like myself. On top of the wonderful food served, the owners are extremely friendly and provide great service. The small new restaurant is a hidden jewel of authentic Asian cuisine in the Charlotte area. I plan to return and hope to see more customers enjoying the food as well. Thank you YUME!"}
{"text":"Come get your slup on, Charlotte!  Head on over to YUME Bistro and let Japanese master chef Tony and his wife treat you to some mighty good authentic ramen and Japanese cuisine.  

Having recently moved from the Bay Area, where awesome ramen is kind of everywhere, I've been on a mad quest for the yummiest, most authentic ramen in the Charlotte area to satisfy my appreciation and am relieved my quest is over. 

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with exceptional warmth that continued throughout my dinner.  I felt like I was being treated like family.  When they found out it was my first time visiting them, the owner, Tony, came over and provided a great description of their menu, explaining the different dishes.  All of my questions were answered and I was so much more informed on ramen and Japanese food in general.  I've been winging it all along because I love it so much!    

For lunch, they offer four traditional kinds of ramen: shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), miso (fermented bean paste), and a spicy miso all in a tonkotsu (pork bone) broth base.  For dinner, they add Korean Kimchi, Thai Curry (curry and coconut milk), and Spicy Mentaiko (spiced, salted roe) ramen to the menu.  With the variety here, its a great place to go to get to know delicious, authentic ramen. 

The tonkotsu had the rich, salty, creamy, fatty flavor of the pork bone broth, just as it should be.  Its all about the broth!  The kakuni bao (pork bun)... I'm still thinking about it.  So freaking good!  It was perfect.

Not only does YUME make AMAZING authentic ramen, they offer a nice variety of Donburi (rice bowls), appetizers, and topings of your choice.  

I can't wait to get back and try more!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal. It's not westernized fusion BS. If you go to J Town in Los Angeles you'll get the same flavor and quality. Finally a legit Japanese ramen and rice bowl place  

The Ramen base is on the salty side. Not sure why. I opted for the miso base thinking it would be less salty but it's the same. Nonetheless, that's just me being critical. Everything is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Yume. It's in the middle of nowhere. But, well as suggested my brother found a place where he went and it wasn't bad at all. Was it the best? In my opinion, not really, but it certainly beats out a lot of places where I live currently so I'm not going to complain. So lets break down the pros and cons of this place...

Pros: Good food. Neat Experience. Can take out if you wanted to.
Cons: No large seating and a bit of a drive.

I came from West Charlotte, and well this place is a bit of a drive as it was in Matthews, but I guess if there's good food the drive isn't that bad. The Hawaiian Ahi Poke was pretty good, albeit it was a little spicy and salty. It would definitely do good with something to along with it, but it's definitely something that should be ordered if you like tuna tartare. That was something that was unique and where you can't really get at another take out spot. The Ramen was also something that was interesting. It definitely beat any type of Ramen I could get in Tennessee, especially the horrible one I got when I went to Nashville, so this was pretty welcoming. 

For a takeout spot, this place is actually worth going to and trying out. The only down part was, well if you live across town it's a bit of a drive. Otherwise, this is definitely a place to check out if you're nearby and you want to try something unique."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!  Perfect flavor and spice!  Charlotte doesn't have many noodle restaurants so we were very pleased to find this authentic noodle house with such great food.  Great customer service and kept clean."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall in Matthews NC. The food is Excellent, and I will reflect the Pros then the Cons, 

Pros- Very Clean, Sanitation Score of 96.5 I think, SUPER Friendly People, I was Greeted by everyone, including the Chef, people hurried out of the kitchen to Clean off a table for us. The waitress was very attentive to our needs and took my requests to the chef. Bathrooms were clean, the restaurant smelled clean. 

Cons- this place is tiny guys, like 8 tables tiny, it's a true hole in the wall. But they clean tables off really quickly. It'll take about 25 min to eat here. Next, half the menu is Bowls made with Ramen Noodles. Last, it's pretty expensive for what you get. It's Excellent tasting but you're gonna pay for it. 20 bucks bought me a Souped up bowl of Ramen Noodles and a Can of Ginger Ale, that's the price of me not being able to cook I guess :)

All in all, I would do it again but sparingly due to the price."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of ramen, and YUME definitely has some good ramen selection to choose from. I came from California, so my standard for ramen is a little different from the East Coast, but YUME was pretty close to some of the good noodle shop that I had back in Southern California. I would have given a 4-star, but the attentive waiting staff is what pushing this over the top, I appreciate the service as well as the food!"}
{"text":"Don't miss this...eat there tonight. Fresh, clean food and affordable

Don't be fooled by the dining set up, more fast food looking than restaurant.  Fantastic authentic Japanese , don't expect American Japanese food here, no cooking at the table using tons of butter !!  

Everything we tried was fresh and delicious.  Appetizers, Ramen bowls, rice bowls and Chef Specials prepared with fresh ingredients by a skilled Chef/Owner.

This restaurant will be a definite go to whenever I'm in the area.  A hidden gem.  Family run...very friendly and appreciative young couple.  They've been open 3 months.....Town of Matthews give them a try...I wish I had this in Greensboro"}
{"text":"First time trying them out. We started with the octopus balls. It is apparently very popular. Well prepared and visually attractive.  However, I think next time we will go with the pork buns. Just a taste preference for us.  I had the Thai style Ramen. It was DELICIOUS!  A little heat a little sweet. I've tried another popular Ramen place and this was,in my opinion way better. You can tell the chef puts a lot of work into the broth. He takes pride in the presentation. My husband tried the Katsu curry rice dish. It was crispy and spicy. Very fresh! I love the iced green tea. Had a hint of Jasmine. Very refreshing. Too full for dessert. Maybe next time. All in all very happy with our meal and the service was excellent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in NC. Took a two hour drive from Raleigh to try this place. Owner is from SF and worked at SF Japan town ramen place before. The soup base is the real stuff, not fake powders like other places. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! Went for lunch by myself and I can't wait to go again with friends to order more food. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. Delicious! The broth is so flavorful and it was definitely enough food for one person. I do wish I had a thicker piece of pork however. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more!"}
{"text":"I've never had real Ramen before and now I can't live without it. There isn't anything on the menu that is bad (except the tea but you don't go there for the tea). I would drink the broth by the gallon if I could. I can't go a few days without going back."}
{"text":"The drive from Huntersville was worth it!  We had such a delicious meal.  Our Tonkotsu Shio Ramen and Thai Curry Ramen was just excellent.  We also had Japanese fried wings,  which we also loved.  Tony and Rosanna were so friendly and our service was great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A small family joint putting out high quality ramen. Get over here Guy! I was heading home from central South Carolina so this place was close around dinner time. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was great. It looked awesome and I dug right in for the egg to get at the gooey yolk. The heat level was perfect, and didn't overpower the other flavors at all.

The broth was amazing, and once I finished everything else I understood the warning on the menu. The broth was too good not to slurp up every last drop of. It is a little expensive for just  a bowl of ramen, but I think the quality is there to justify it. I was thinking four stars but the broth really elevated it to a five star place for me. Definitely a place to try if you like Ramen or if you like someone putting everything they've got into making food for you!"}
{"text":"If your in the mood for a ramen soup. OMG
THIS PLACE IS IT. My wife had the curry and I had the miso. It was one of the best we've had. This place is a must go. It looks like a small take out but eat in it's worth it!
The waitress was vey informative and really wanted to help. Great great great."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch here today! The warm - welcoming couple who own this are from my neck of the woods in California. Their food was unique, fresh and properly prepared. An outstanding alternative to typical Asian fare. Please check them out and support this wonderful local business!"}
{"text":"Middle of nowhere but a good attempts Japanese. Poke was outstanding. Ramen was worth trying again"}
{"text":"?????????????????????
???????????
???????????????
??????????????????"}
{"text":"\"Slurp it up all up\" is what you'll find printed at the bottom of the menu, along with a note that the broth takes 20 hours to make! I've ordered take-out for my family, and while it was a bit expensive, it sure was tasty and authentic.  They can make gluten free dishes, give lots of information on ingredients, change spice levels etc.. A friend of mine is a wonderful cook, and she says this is a good spot too."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I had the coconut Thia ramen and my whole table tried to steal it from me-so good. My daughter got the curry chicken cutlet- yummy. I would ask for the curry on the side because this portion has more that enough for left overs and you don't want it to be soggy."}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Food comes out quickly and bursting with flavors.  The broth that is served with most of their dishes is so could I feel like I could drink it by the glass.  My only complaint would be that there was no paper towels or tp in restrooms.  As slow as the restaurant was I would think they would have had a little time to check on that kind of stuff.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Little \"hole in the wall\" that surprises!  Come here for the ramen, so far this is the only place I'd give 2 thumbs up in Charlotte.  Their broth is full bodied, flavorful and crisp, unlike some I've had before where their is oil or extra fats floating around.  The noodles are firm, not soaking wet, shlurp loudly for best flavor!  We just found this place a few days ago, and are now back 2 days later for more!  

More updates and more pics to follow as I pick out new goodies from their menu.

I think I've found our go to Ramen Spot in Charlotte! 

PS- it's not a huge place so either call for a reservation or be prepared for a little wait.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I had serious ordering anxiety during my visit to YUME. I mean, how can you visit a place known for their ramen and not get ramen? But, the Hawaiian Ahi Poké was staring down at me from the specials board. And, I noticed the buns on the menu. The list of delicious sounding small plates goes on and on. After hemming and hawing for at least 10-minutes, I  struck a deal with my friend (I'll order the poke, buns and seaweed salad; you order the kimchi ramen and we'll share tastes) and placed an order. 

Happy to report, I made the right choice! YUME's Poké was the best I've ever had outside of Hawaii. Fresh, high quality ahi, just a little spicy, I think from the seaweed, tossed in nori for an interesting \"burst\" of texture and with slivers of green onion... Yum! YUME, if you're reading this, you should move this dish off your specials into your regular menu, stat. The thought of visiting again and this dish not being available just makes me sad. 

Everything else I tasted was equally fresh and delicious. The bun was soft and savory. The seaweed salad was light and refreshing. The kimchi ramen was warm and satisfying. 

Just last night, I went to Baku (a similar but more fancy-pants/upscale restaurant near South Park) and I found myself wishing I was at YUME instead... I see many visits to YUME in my future!"}
{"text":"Small but unique Ramen and rice dish spot, in the Harris Teeter shopping center on Chestnut rd.  It has the size and ambiance of a take out spot, but the menu and quality of a sit down restaurant.   

The Ramen dishes on the menu sounded tasty, but i decided to go with a marinated beef rice bowl.  It was very good!  The waitress even humored me by bringing a mayonnaise Sriracha sauce.  

Average dishes are $11-$14.  There are some apps and small plates for under $10.  Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is great, by far some of the best Japanese food I've had in charlotte! Tried just about everything on the menu and I honestly don't know what's my favorite. The flavors are so authentic and the food is always fresh! Absolutely love this place! The owners are wonderful, friendly foodies."}
{"text":"We had the gyoza to start and it was tasty. The ramen bowls were large servings and good, but not blow your mind good, especially for the price. Just under $40 with tip for two people for lunch is too much! The server was pleasant but not at all knowledgeable about the menu. And it took a long time for the food to arrive. All in all, not a bad experience, but not quite worth it and we probably won't return."}
{"text":"You should definitely take the drive (and it is a bit of a drive for most) to find your way to YUME, because it is certainly a find. While there are other ramen places in Charlotte, and there is a certain similarity to most of them, what sets this one apart is the service.

This may be the smallest of the places where you can find a good bowl, and there are only five or six tables in the whole place, so it can certainly feel cramped if there are more than a couple of people inside, but it is worth it. From the moment you come in, the staff makes you feel welcome, which is nice because with two big boards of options as well as possible specials, it can certainly feel intimidating.

What they will do is help you through that list, find something that meets your needs and get it right out to you - some of the fastest and tastiest service around, well worth checking out if you are anywhere nearby (or even if you aren't)."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! Went for lunch on a cool winter day for a bowl of spicy ramen, and was not let down. Flavor was on point, the egg was cooked perfectly (hard white, runny yolk), and the spice level was just right. Only had the spicy tonkatsu ramen, but all the other lunch/dinner offerings looked pretty tasty as well. Can't wait to try them all!

My only regret is not finding this gem of a restaurant earlier. I'm definitely adding YUME to my lunch routine."}
{"text":"Really solid food, even for a soft opening.  The chef and his sweet wife are running this restaurant with little help and they are really doing a great job.  Service was so very friendly and the food was fantastic.  The takoyaki are must try and some of the best I've ever had.  Karaage chicken was crispy, delicious, and extremely tasty.  The tonkotsu shoyu ramen was good not the best I have ever had it needed some more depth of flavor.  Negitoro Don was excellent.  The chashu donburri also excellent.  Overall the food here is very good and I think will continue to improve, it's definitely a great value and worth return visits."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, heard good things, but it was just ok. The service was very good. Will come back and give it another opportunity."}
{"text":"Went because Yelp recommended it as hot and new. I'll admit my expectations were high, having eaten ramen in LA and Hawaii which are literally the best outside of Japan. I had takoyaki which was expensive given the regular price of $4 in places like LA and only $5 in Hawaii. Taste was okay but the dough was lacking flavor. For ramen I had the tonkotsu miso which was sub par. The broth had little flavor, the noodles were thick and didn't have any flavor because they weren't the right noodles, the pork was thick and tough which should have melted in your mouth, the broth was lukewarm at best, and the whole bowl was so overwhelmed in scallions that my breath reeks of onions even an hour after eating. The boiled egg was literally the only redeeming quality, as the cook was good but it wasn't marinated enough. Normally, ajitama are a dark brown. These barely had any color. I was excited to try this place in hopes of finally having a ramen house in Charlotte. I'll hold out my hopes."}
{"text":"New owners!   Great Raman dishes and was very surprised at the excellence food and service.  I'm happy I stopped in, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ramen! Many choices, cannot wait to come back and try them all...they will make vegetarian substitution on request....karaage don was delicious also!"}
{"text":"Great little japanese restaurant tucked away in Matthews. Besides ramen the menu is filled with plenty of authentic japanese dishes. The chicken karaage was good, marinated well. Fried white meat instead of the traditional dark meat but was very good regardless. The japanese mayo could use a bit of enhancement. The octopus balls were very good. Spicy seafood ramen was well done. The broth was nice. My friend ordered the shoyu ramen it was a but different from the shoyu ramen we've had in the past. I wonder if it was just the tonkotsu base with additional soy sauce added to make it shoyu. It was a good broth though. Service was good. The restaurant has about 8 tables so it can get crowded in there. Recommend getting there early or you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"The ramen is pretty good, not explosive-umami good, but still better than most ramen shops I've been to in Charlotte. Although for the price I'd expect a little more meat, an order of ramen only had 1 slice of pork, which was slightly disappointing. The takoyaki was so delicious and paired really well with the ramen. But it's a shame that the actual octapus inside was very chewy and tasted frozen."}
{"text":"I cannot believe Japanese food this good is in our backyard! the vegetable curry is homemade and better than curry I've had in Japan!  Daikon in the stew was de-lish, and tonkatsu was tender.  what a treat! we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant located right next to HT in Matthews. I was craving ramen and found this place on Yelp (Thanks, Yelp!). Maybe a little further, but I decided to give it a try.

There is a parking lot. The place is small but not an uncomfortable size. They have special menus every day. Note that if your party have more than 5 people, you better call for a reservation. 

For food my table ordered Takoyaki balls to start off. They were Tokyo style (not mushy like Osaka style). For my meal I had Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen. I told my waitress that I wanted to substitute bean sprouts in stead of noodles. I loved the broth. I best shoyu broth I've ever had so far in the States. My fiance had spicy miso ramen. The broth was so delicious and good kick of spice to it. The noodles were amazing. Unfortunately, their pork belly was a little bland, not well seasoned. 

Service was incredible. 4 stars because my ramen was supposed to be $13, but they added extra $2 for what I wanted to substitute from noodles to bean sprouts. A little pricey for what you got.

I would return again to try out some of their other items. I would give them 3 1/2 stars but yelp doesn't allow for that so 4 stars it is :)"}
{"text":"Food is actually good but the service was bad enough to never come back. DO NOT attempt to go here for lunch. It took almost the entire lunch hour to even get the food. The server was a young kid, probably the son of the owner or something but he didnt know left from right. Someone in our party ordered an $8 special from the board on the wall and he charged $14 because he brought out something that wasn't even ordered. The cook was great and tried to help out the best he could but it was just the 2 of them and he was pulling all the weight. Server couldn't even count change when it was time to check out. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Just finished our first meal at Yume tonight and we couldn't be happier with the experience! So great to have a ramen place in out little part of town, no more journeying to Southend for a ramen fix! The owners were so kind and helpful and every dish was beautifully presented. Appetizers were small but delicious and the ramen bowls were generous with great flavor. I especially enjoyed the kimchi ramen, great spice!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"It didn't meet my expectations. I'm from New York and maybe I have high standards with all those amazing restaurants in NY! Tonkatsu spicy Miso, first of all pork was so big in one thick strip it was hard to eat it, plus it was chewy, I'm used to having the pork literally falling apart and juicy as you bite into it. Maybe it needed to be cooked a lot longer. The flavor of soup was so so, for $14 the portion was on small side. Pork cutlet with curry, the pork was good but the curry was too sweet for my taste. The karaage (fried chicken) was ok, too much dark meat was used. Very nice couple running the place, wishing them best of luck"}
{"text":"Noodles were decent, but I was a bit let down by the bowl of ramen I had here.  Could have hyped myself too much and expected a lot.

Overall the dining experience was okay.  The place was about a 30 minute drive if you are coming from uptown.  And the dining space was very cozy... 8 tables total.  

We got there right at 7pm on a Sunday... and the place did fill up after we sat down.  Our server was nice and gave us a lot of time to peruse the menu.  Ended up getting the YUME hamachi appetizer (price was incorrectly listed on the menu, but the server came by to check with us if the increase in price was ok).  And then I ordered the spicy miso ramen bowl... which was good.... but the pepper strings in it really just blew my pallet out and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my meal.

I want to just mention that Charlotte/Matthews ramen scene is still relatively young so I expect these trail blazer restaurants to have their food on point.  The few other places that do offer ramen are ranking a little higher than YUME in my book.  I will have to come back and try another ramen bowl (maybe not the spicy one) but I am really glad to see a place like this open up in the suburbs because it shows the diverse food culture that North Carolinians are ready for and craving."}
{"text":"The noodles were not homemade. They were plain white noodles. The noodles were also overcooked. These dry box noodles are usually very forgiving. The noodles were overcooked by at least 5 minutes. They were generous with Char-Siu pork, two thick slices of pork. Unfortunately, the flavors were bland. The ramen noodle bowls come with a whole soft boiled egg, but they did not state whether or not the eggs were pasteurized. I don't know whether or not the egg yolk is safe to eat. 

Service was great! Appetizer portions were small."}
