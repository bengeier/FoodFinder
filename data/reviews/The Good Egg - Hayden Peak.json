{"text":"Brought my mom, wife and kids for Mother's Day. Even though it is a busy day, they accommodated us quickly. My wife loves their flavored coffees so she had Irish Mint and it didn't disappoint. My Eye Opener of eggs, bacon, and chocolate chip and banana wholewheat pancakes hit the spot. The bacon was so perfect that we were talking about it in the car the whole ride home. Love all the Good Eggs, this location might be our favorite."}
{"text":"Although this place is across the street from my house, I stopped going because their food, decor and service are just gross. It looks and tastes like it should be on \"Restaurant Impossible\"."}
{"text":"Great way to have a business meeting over a plate of French Toast and coffee. The french toast was delicious and the fresh fruit tasted really fresh. The coffee was from across the street from Starbucks. As busy as they were, we were taken care of. Has anyone tried their Lite Calorie breakfast meals?"}
{"text":"My family and I used to love the Good Egg. It was the best place in the valley for yummy pancakes. However, ever since First Watch took over, the pancakes aren't good anymore. We will not go back again. The food is no longer worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful breakfast place! It is consistently amazing. The service is top notch; I have a two year old and they are always so accommodating. The servers are engaging to my little ones. They are prompt and welcoming. The food is also consistently delicious. Don't skip the avocado toast, the sunrise Benedict  or the lumberjack. And the kids menu has many choices. Overall, great place and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Waited 9 minutes once seated to be approached by a server. Condiments missing from table. Food portions smaller than other units.  More servers milling around than patrons.  Looks like they do a fraction of the volume of the store at Scottsdale rd & Thunderbird. In need of a serious managerial over-hall. AVOID"}
{"text":"I made a ritual (alone or with friends) of a weekend brunch at the Good Egg for years; one of the perks was filling out a \"rewards\" card that qualified for a free breakfast after purchasing 10. I went so often I had four plus cards filled out at the end of the year. In January, went after missing out over the long holidays and when I presented one of the rewards cards to the cashier was told that despite the Good Egg name on the front this was now something called First Watch and they do not honor the cards any more. The $7-$8 that a customer saves by using the card is obviously no big deal, but if a company is going to trade on the good will of it's predecessor but refuse to honor that company's commitments I figure they aren't going to be much good in the long run anyway, and most reviews shown here since January confirm that."}
{"text":"What an improvement  since I assume new management has taken over? Food is average but service is great and employees are friendly which goes a long way anymore. The young lady who runs the front is always cheerful and comes by to make sure we are happy. We love weekdays here but the weekend crowds turn us off. Prices are a bit high but again service is what people want -to be treated well and feel valued as a  customer. Also note to owners please keep some simple traditional items on your menu- not all of us folks are looking for trendy breakfast fare a just the basics work too. A+ Ask for Regina."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Great Service.  Menu has so many options, we'll eat here again.  Joanne (waitress) was helpful, prompt and personable.  Love the pitcher of water and coffee on the table as well as the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Saturday and it was fantastic. Our server Michelle was great. She took excellent care of us. Try the Eggs Benedict. They were really good. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Breakfasts are yummy.  I have eaten both breakfast and lunch here.  I had a BLT with avocado that was so good, I ate every single morsel and that is not like me.  My husband tried the egg salad sandwich and he loved it.  He ordered a cup of Baja Enchilada soup to accompany his sandwich and the soup was unbelievably delicious.  I can not find a recipe for this soup and if you know what is in it, please tell me because I don't go to Arizona but once or twice a year.  The service was very reasonable.  We have had to wait sometimes but since the food is good, the wait is tolerable. I see that some people have negative things to say about this place but my experiences here have been very positive. (and I hate eating ANYTHING in Denny's or IHOP so I wouldn't go back here if I thought this place were anywhere in the same category)"}
{"text":"I use to love having breakfast here...but since the merger, quality and timely service have greatly diminished. I just waited 35 min for breakfast! And I watched other tables have the same experience.  FIRST WATCH apparently thought they knew this business better, but from a regular customer's perspective, I wish for the old good egg."}
{"text":"On March 23rd, 2015 -- my wife had eggs Benedict and I had whole grain pancakes with berries and coffe, of course.  I would rate both at B+.  The service was exceptional, with more servers per customer than anyone could expect.  We were a little early and there were few customers.  Good value for the money.  I would happily go back again."}
{"text":"I've been a Good Egg devotee for years, and having just moved to the area I was thrilled to find one so close by. \"Best Things in Life\" card in hand, I headed over for breakfast. The food was good, no different than the other locations I've frequented. The problem was the service. My server barely seemed to have time to glance down at me as I gave her my order. She was much more friendly to a regular at a nearby table and chatted with him at length. Ok, I thought, that's not unusual. The problem is that the regular customer got his very complicated meal before I did though he ordered after me. As I sat waiting nearly 20 minutes for a simple fried egg and bacon, the server did not stop by once to let me know my food would be along soon, nor did she refill my orange juice. When the food finally came it was delivered without a word and she never came back to see if it was okay or if I needed anything. I remember long ago when the Good Egg had comment cards at the table, and I wish this one had that option. I think I'll be looking for another location, even though this one is so close to my place."}
{"text":"Always great service and food.  The servers and cashiers act as a cohesive unit.  This is the best location --- some of the other locations could learn from this store.  New review June 29, 2016  REALLY disappointing.  They have turned over the entire staff.  We use to have a lovely greeting by Terri, along with our servers Joanne and Richard and McKenzie....they are all gone do to changes in management.  We have limited our visits (as it is convenient to our home) but are in search of another place.  So sad that the good vibe and feeling welcome have been lost with these management changes"}
{"text":"Since the merger and the removal of the heat lamps in the kitchen every meal in the last five visits has had cold food! These places have improved visually but declined in quality! What used to be a consistent breakfast eatery is now no better than a bad truck stop! Food quality has declined and the service staff is taking the brunt of the wrath from customers. Corporate has lost touch of their customer with bad processes!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for breakfast. Great menu! However i pretty much always go with the Wildcat Scramble!  Always offers to provide ice tea in a to go glass.....just has always been a reliable and friendly place to have breakfast!"}
{"text":"A good place for eggs, pancakes and such for breakfast. Also, they are quick with the coffee and leave the whole pot there, which is key for me on many a morning. The other great thing is that while this place gets packed on the weekends, it moves people in and out quickly, so you never wait that long. The menu is HUGE and they allow substitutions, so it is good when you have friends, family or picky eaters in town."}
{"text":"A few years back we lived in Carefree and ate at the Good Egg there at least weekly. Then we moved out of state. Now we're back, and couldn't wait to go to the Good Egg again! The Hayden location is closest to our home so off we go.  We've been there twice now, and we won't be returning. Both times the pancake was under sized, and the last time, overdone. Service was OK, but food was not all that great.  What happened to you Good Egg?"}
{"text":"Sad that they only offer strawberry jam to replace the Dickenson's black raspberry. I  allergic to strawberries. Probably will be dining elsewhere. New coffee is too strong also. Breakfasts must be consistent! :-(("}
{"text":"The Phoenix locations are hit and miss... mostly miss for service.  But the food is good. There are lots of choices, both tradtional bad for you breakfast, and healthy delicious options.  This is one of their newest locations, it still has that fresh and up-to-date feel, which is a plus.  Patio seems nice for the days when the weather is right, it is in a nice complex, parking is a little tight, but oh well.  The coffee here is amazing. The flavored coffee of the day has never let me down."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have visited this location but I am glad that I decided to stop for breakfast today. The place was very clean and service was friendly especially for a busy breakfast joint. I had the breakfast sandwich with avocado that did not disappoint. I will be back!"}
{"text":"YUM! I wish there were Good Egg's on the East Coast.  This was an adorable breakfast joint that is a chain in Arionza (maybe the west coast too?!).  It was delicious.  I had a breakfast crosiant with eggs.  More importantly the prices were right and the service was GREAT!"}
{"text":"The place felt a little dated in the decour.  Food was not impressive, similar to what you would expect from a Denny's or an IHOP.  The plastic pitcher the water was served from had a yellow tinge and looked like it hadn't been changed since the '70s .  I have no interest in returning to one of this chain's establishments as it lacked quality."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast.  Always consistent food, friendly wait staff and always a line.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good pancakes and don't forget about the egg!  You can get your eggs just about anyway you want.  For a fast inexpensive option for breakfast, I go to the Good Egg.  With multiple locations throughout the valley I am sure that there is a Good Egg near you."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy place for breakfast or early lunch. I like their quesedilla, and I know that's weird in a place like this! Comes with sour cream and fresh salsa. Never eat at Denny's or Coco's if you have one of these places around!"}
{"text":"Had a Breakfast Skillet, two times, here, and was delicious!  I highly recommend The Good Egg as a go to place for breakfast in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best breakfasts i have had in years!!  The pancakes melt in your mouth !! the omeletts are so fluffy and full of high quality ingrediants!! The service is always outstanding too!!!  I would recomend this place !!!"}
{"text":"I had given this good egg a previous bad review. So I wanted to update my review. The issue we had before has been taken care of. We had a excellent breakfast and service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. I had the egg white veggie omelet with turkey sausage and a side of wheat toast. You can also choose two sides. I elected to get a side of fruit. Overall, my experience only deserves 3 stars due to two mistakes on my meal. I recommend this breakfast resturant if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Should be called The Bad Egg. I went there for breakfast today, I thought the place was spotless clean and had an interesting menu.  I ordered the \"Bacado\" omelette (bacon, jack, avocado and tomato). The waitress took forever to bring our water. The food took at least 25 minutes to come out and the place was half full. The server, who was clearly grouchy by the way he slammed the kitchen door over and over, literally threw our plates on the table. The omelette was garbage. Bacon hardly cooked, hardly any cheese, and the avocado was rock hard. The potatoes that accompanied the omelette were ok at best, and were undercooked. Hey, they did do a great job toasting my english muffin!  I can't believe this place is successful enough to expand to a chain. I planned on giving two stars, until I had to make a run to the bathroom shortly after eating. 1 star. Garbage!"}
{"text":"My family frequents this location about once a week, mainly because of the convenient location and friendly service. I usually order one of their egg specials of the day (around $9) or blueberry pancakes ($5.95 for two). My dad always gets the eye opener, which includes two small pancakes, two eggs, and four pieces of bacon. At $7.50 it's a great deal. My mom goes with the nurse bialy breakfast, a healthier option with egg whites, yogurt, fruit, and a bialy.  The egg dishes are just okay, while the pancakes are consistently good. I've add an omelett before and was definitely not impressed. Go with the special of the day or a scrambler.  The interior decor may be lacking, but the patio has a great vibe. We usually sit near the end and bring our pup (tied up to the other side of the railing).  If you come during peak breakfast times (aka 8-10 am weekends) expect to wait for a table. They have a coffee stand outside for while you wait."}
{"text":"This is a cute place,decorated nice and comfortable, the waitresses are all very nice and attentive. Food was just ok though,I had the eggs Benedict and I was underwhelmed,I thought the sauce was a little to salty and I wish they used canadian bacon instead of sliced lunch meat ham.everyone else loved they're food, so I'm sure it was just me. Prices are really good for this area so that's a plus+..."}
{"text":"Nothing bad happened but I wasn't majorly impressed either.  The menu and ambiance are pretty generic.  Just seems like a very average place!  I tried the Great Grains, which was a bowl of 7 grains (or you can choose oatmeal) topped with berries, bananas, and nuts with a side of brown sugar and milk.  The grains looked and tasted pretty much like oatmeal and were lacking any exciting flavor.  I will say, the portion size was fairly large and this meal was only $4.95.  However, $1.95 for coffee seems a bit excessive.  Isn't that, like, more than Starbucks charges for basic coffee?    I know I'm always complaining about places that give disgustingly huge, unhealthy portions, but my friend's 3-egg omelet seemed a bit small compared to omelets at other places.  One plus I noticed was that they only charge .50 to sub egg whites for the egg dishes."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. I had the buttermilk pancakes,eggs and bacon. My breakfast was very good. Will definitely  return after a morning hike"}
{"text":"Waited 30 min for a table and another 20 min for food and was brought out cold. I have been coming to the good egg for years and the food quality has also suffered since they have grown so big. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Good Egg.  The place is adorable and clean, the service is awesome and the menu selection is fabulous.  Food is always great and I love that they have the calorie counts on the menu.  Keeps me honest!"}
{"text":"I had a business meeting here this morning and I thought the service and the food was good.   I ordered a Denver Omelette which came with country potatoes and an English Muffin. I liked that they had plenty of strawberry jam packets on the table so that I could decorate my English Muffin. And to complete the job I piled on some Omelette on top of the English Muffin. A perfect combination of ham, onions, green peppers, eggs, English Muffin and of course strawberry jam.  The country potatoes were also delicious. So I would definitely order this combination again when I visit The Good Egg next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food as always. Being from California, this is a place we make sure to stop at every time we are in the area.   We were pleasantly surprised to see \"Avocado Toast\" on the Summer menu...my husband's favorite breakfast meal. It's a multi grained toast with avocado and basted eggs on top--must try! I had the veggie skillet, delicious.   Always greeted with a smile and served by friendly servers. Thanks Good Egg for a great morning start!"}
{"text":"Some days are so weird. Has this ever happened to you?  You wake up one morning with no perceivable hangover symptoms.  Something is very wrong you reason, knowing full well how those sake bombers last night should have spiraled you down into a massive sub-human funk, but miraculously, you feel halfway human.  Maybe it was something you ate at Jack in the Box at 4 am. Or maybe, you're still drunk and that first tsunami of nausea hasn't washed over you yet, in ether case, you don't care because for once you actually feel good.  Good enough to eat breakfast for a change.   You've heard people speak of this bizarre concept...eating ones meals in lieu of drinking them, but now it's time to try it out for yourself. Off you go, to the Good Egg!  Start in with some fruit juice, like the grapefruit. It tastes fresh squeezed and is served up in a huge glass, not a tiny little juice glass. Nice. You wish you had some vodka right about now, I know, but lets stay on track, shall we, the waitress is headed in your direction. Quick, look over the menu. Pick something.   Nothing looks good, I know, but you're on a mission.  To actually eat something today other than Reese's peanut butter cups and diet coke.  Here's my two cents.  Go with the seven grain Oatmeal.  I know, it sounds repulsive. And more so, it even looks repulsive....its contents littered with every type of nut, seed, fruit and berry imaginable. Almost as if a stray coyote sauntered into the kitchen, found the pot of oatmeal cooking and unceremoniously took a dump in the pot.  Forget all that, just hold your nose and eat it.  Surprised, right? It's damned tasty isn't it?  Now go. Pay the bill, get your loyal customer card stamped and head back home for a nap...  before you finally realize you only slept for an hour last night, and how theres a wave of nausea headed your way. Only this is no ordinary wave. This wave resembles Jaws, the infamous North Shore wave that eats surfers....for breakfast. Oh, the irony."}
{"text":"Say it ain't so..... Missing The Good Egg - which we've been going to for \"decades\" at the Hilton Village.  Then, as we moved North, always found a different Good Egg in our neighborhood!  We've been at Hayden Peak for as long as they've been open. A visit today and we were in an HGTV commercial full of shiplap, Edison light bulbs and distressed furniture. Appreciate the need for updating, but creativity - not copying Joanna Gaines' style - would have been nice.       Food was good, although miss the Sun Devil which you used to prepare even though it hasn't been on the menu.  Had to request an off-the-menu simple pancake with blueberries which the chef made.  Thank you.       But what we miss the most is the PUNCH CARD.  It was always a nice \"thank you\" for coming and we look forward to seeing you again reminder.  Know the website is easier for a corporation to manage, but you've lost some of your charm.    We will be back, but it's just not the same."}
{"text":"We're visiting in the area and came across this restaurant. I had the avocado toast, it was delicious!! My husband had the Eggs Benedict and loved it. We thought the prices were very reasonable. We are planning to  go back before we head home"}
{"text":"We will come here sometimes to avoid the crowds at Butterfields only to be disappointed by the lackluster fare.  The breakfast meats are over cooked, the poached eggs are served in an unappetizing way (in a little cup and usually under poached and not hot enough--scary!)."}
{"text":"Food was decent and the waitress served us pretty well. Although, the protein meal that I ordered was just average. Tasted somewhat bland with even blander sides.  I guess the OJ was good. You can't screw up OJ! If they did, it would have been a 1 star. lol. Good for breakfast but I think other breakfast places might have tastier items on their menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but the food just is. It's not fantastic and it's not bad... it's just decent breakfast food. The service was outstanding though!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Staff was a little slow, but food was delish! I had the special- the smoked salmon and cucumber toast, and my fiancé had the breakfast super bowl. Both plates were licked clean. We also spilt one of the fresh squeezed juices- the kale one and that was on point too. We will defiantly go back!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointing.  First watch, you have ruined the good egg.  Omelette was just ok...I could have been cooked more and been significantly hotter.  English muffins are supposed to be toasted.  Not soggy and barely warm.  Potatoes??? Fully cooked and hot would be awesome.  Just terrible.  I'm going home for a snack now.  Still hungry.  BTW... I've been to other first watch locations around the country and the breakfast was significantly better.  I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I eat at this location very regularly.  It's not the hanging gardens, but it's a damn good place for breakfast.  The old pueblo is my favorite.  The service at this location is top-notch as well.   I will mention however, this is the only location I find the kind of consistency one expects with a breakfast place.  I have literally been to every good egg in two counties, and only this location gets it right."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and the ambiance is upgraded. The food, however, has not received the same attention as the ambiance.   I specially asked if the berries on the crepe were fresh or frozen and then thawed when ordering. I was told they were fresh. I have attached the picture so you can be the judge. Additionally, the water was not properly filtered. It had a strong chlorine taste.   Service was fast and we were seated quickly. Unfortunately, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Okay for brunch.  Quite a wait for a table on a Sunday.  Service was okay.   Best thing I can say about my Benedict is that the eggs were cooked right.  But nothing special.  The potatoes were cold.  Not sure if that is because they plates were waiting at the pass, or if they were cooked in a gigantic quantity and had been sitting for 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"We had a very nice post thanksgiving breakfast at this Goid Egg. We were a large crowd, including 4 little ones. The service was excellent and the food came out without much of a wait. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service is great and the pancakes are super fluffy (even the whole wheat ones). The blueberries they put in them are fat and juicy and the coffee is superb!"}
{"text":"We went to a First Watch (expecting it to be the Good Egg, but it's been overhauled) on 3/31 and it was a let-down, so we looked and found a different location for the next day.    Went to the Hayden location for brekkie on 4/1/16. It still says Good Egg on the outside, but is mostly the new First Watch inside, which is a drag. The menu of First Watch doesn't compare to the Good Egg. Kids don't want multi-grain pancakes. I'd rather at least have an option! This restaurant still has parts of both menus or we would have left for sure.   My husband ordered a skillet, kids got pancakes, and I ordered an omelette with jack cheese and avocado. The omelette came out with no avocado. Our waitress took it back and it came with 3 sad slices of super-stringy avocado. I told her I would throw that away if I were home. She took it back and then they decided to start over!! I didn't need them to start over!       Kids are done...husband is done...we want to leave...omelette is ready!   At least they didn't charge us for the omelette, but I was ready to go to Starbucks across the parking lot and get an egg sandwich. I wanted out.   This chain needs work. Both days were sub-adequate."}
{"text":"I couldn't finish my food because it was cold and tasteless.  I've had meals at IHOP that have been better.  I should have walked out before I ate because the decor was terrible, and that should have been the first sign.  Drinking water out of an old plastic cup was also gross.  I had the eggs benedict and the muffin was not fresh and the sauce was not creamy or hot.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Went to have breakfast here. Place is clean. We sat for 15 minutes and no service. Waiters walked by and didn't even acknowledge us. So we had to leave and still nobody said anything."}
{"text":"The Good Egg at Hayden is the neighborhood place for breakfast and lunch. The food is always top notch and there is never a problem with changing or selecting a special order.  Richard and Joann are the best!"}
{"text":"We wanted to give them another try, but be very hesitant about ordering their omelettes as they do not use fresh eggs in them, they use a packaged mixed which is not healthy and has added ingredients.  They also have new juice combinations I had the glow juice with carrot, orange, lemon and ginger with no ice, tasted pretty good but way over priced @ $4.99.  The oatmeal came with fresh strawberries, blueberries, bananas, cinnamon and nutmeg also overpriced for the small child like bowl.  Again nothing to write home about. Just okay food and very small portions for the price. The benches you sit on are very very had wood, if you need a pillow the wait staff will supply you with one."}
{"text":"If you're looking to have a nice breakfast and don't want to deal with cooking at home, but you want to enjoy a home-cooked style meal; this is your place.   I love the homely and friendly atmosphere, it definitely allows for a comfortable and enjoyable first meal of the day.  The staff are always beyond friendly and very courteous. The customer service and food are always on point and I've not ever had anything but a great experience.  I've been coming here at least once a month for 3 years now and I'm sort of shocked I've  never reviewed these guys. I suppose sometimes the best places we visit we just assume don't need to extra love, but they always do!   The pricing is the best part, very reasonable."}
{"text":"If (like me) you felt that this place was a little lackluster last time you visited, don't you worry. They have remodeled to an extent that I had to look around for a sign to let me know that I was even in the same restaurant. The decor is super clean and rustic. The menu seems to have received a good sprucing up as well... I had some avocado toast that was seriously the bee's knees. The \"basted\" egg that came with it was overlooked and not runny at all, but that might have been a matter of my own personal taste. Overall, if you haven't tried it in a while, give it another shot... You might be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Going for the blt supreme and it was great. The plate came in at 800+ calories. I got to have a pitcher of water at my table and a carafe of coffee so there is no need to flag down a waitress.  The first Good Egg for me was the building now occupied by Rosie McCaffrey's rockin Irish house. That building has always been a lucky shamrock  for me."}
{"text":"Worse service around ,dry very dry biscuits and gravy, but I must say in the end when I was asked how everything was ,I said terrible, the manager took 50% off my bill ,as I told her she did not have to do this,she replied I want you to come back and give us another try ...."}
{"text":"Good service. Eggs benedict were awful...Hollandaise sauce is made from a mix and therefore not even close to the real thing with its pale, greyish color. Don't ruin your breakfast and order something else."}
{"text":"Came to spend the weekend out in Scottsdale and we came here to eat breakfast and everything was DELICIOUS. Our waiter was also amazing!!! Definitely a 10/10"}
{"text":"This location is no longer a Good Egg.  First Watch has taken over and completely changed the restaurant.  They haven't figured out yet that when you put hot food on a cold plate it cools down by the time it gets to the customer.  The food had decent flavor, but all of it that was in direct contact with the plate was cold.   Menu choices are disappointing compared to The Good Egg.  First Watch if probably saving money by having less than half as many menu choices.  We will be checking out other restaurants in the future since our favorite place has been ruined."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot!  Just a mile down the street from my house, I spoil myself here as often as I can.  It's a big place with a modern farm house feel straight from a Pinterest board.  Service has always been phenomenal.  Everyone is friendly and service is fast.  I've never had anything bad on the menu.  Picture perfect every time and it tastes better than it looks.  Their fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious and they serve cream with the coffee.  No half and half cups thingies.  I highly recommend the skillets and the avocado toast.  Today I just needed a pancake haha."}
{"text":"Very great food.. Outdoor seating. Amazing biscuits gravy, had hash browns and eggs. To me it was a lot of food. Outdoor seating was nice and shaded. Indoor is nice as well. Would of guessed this place would be busier on a Friday, probably more busier during Sat Sunday esk.Good prices vs quanity of food."}
{"text":"I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish."}
