{"text":"So happy this place opened up just down the street from us. The panang is so good, the tom yum coconut soup is one of the best I've ever tasted. We've dined in and had take out and have never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this new Thai food place twice already for lunch and once for dinner.  The food is excellent and fresh.  The flavors are very authentic and distinct.  During lunch, there is a lunch special menu that offers soup with whichever dish you order.I have tried the Yellow Curry and the Chicken with Sweet Basil for lunch and I loved them both.   The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable.  The food is only spicy if you ask for it and they can do mild, medium, or very spicy.  I look forward to going back so I can try all the different items on the menu."}
{"text":"our experience with the waitstaff and product quality are both positive and we will come back and recommend.   it seems like the majority  of their  business is take out so the waitstaff may prioritize that but nothing too negative  . overall a good place"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on some previous reviews. My rating is actually 3.5 stars with suggestions for improvement. Staff is great and service is quick. Can't beat the lunch combo deal for $6.95. The egg roll was good but it was more like a Chinese egg roll rather than Thai. I did not like the bland soup at all that came with it. Improve the egg roll and just serve two of those with the lunch combo or serve a cup of the Tom yum soup instead. Four stars if those are changed for the better!
I would have to come back and try the curry dishes and then may upgrade my rating. For lunch I had the Mango delight-not really a Thai dish in my opinion but it was tasty. 
Overall not bad for a new place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, flavorful, and just as spicy as requested. Fresh and authentic. Worth the slight wait."}
{"text":"Nice place. We had the mango chicken and the phat Thai. Really good sauce on the mango chicken. Ordered the Phat Thai hot. Was very good. Portions were decent for one person plus a little left over for take home. Good place....We'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived a bit late (about 8:15pm to a place that closes at 9pm). The staff said that they had started closing, but quickly told us that they would be happy to serve us still. We contemplated getting the food to go, so as not to inconvenience them too much (since we were the only customers in the place), but they said they would be happy to stay late if we wanted to dine-in. We opted to stay and eat there. Our server was very friendly and we chatted with her while our food was being prepared. We both agreed that she was one of the best servers either of us had encountered in some time. So, A+ for a great staff.

On to the food... I got the Yellow Curry for my entree and the Fried Tofu for an appetizer. My friend got the Paht Graphrao and a Chicken Satay appetizer. I also had a couple of Thai Iced Coffee. All of the food was great. Not really anything else to say about it. It was certainly better than I have had elsewhere for the same price. The prices were very reasonable. So, they get an A for good food at good prices.

Overall, I would have no qualms about recommending Chandhra Thai Restaurant to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant with outstanding service."}
{"text":"Based off of the reviews I thought this place would be a lot better. I tried the Paht Thai with chicken and shrimp. The dish would have been okay, if it was not for the pieces of cracked egg shell mixed into it. I say mixed because I am not sure how the cook could have missed it (egg shell is white, the noodles are brownish), unless he had just made a mistake, and did not bother/care to fix it by making more noodles; instead, it was mixed in with the noodles/spices, so I was not able to see it until I started feeling the crunches between my teeth, and began spitting it out. Ultimately, about half of the food went to the trash. Also, this was a take out order or else I would have returned it. 

Since this was my first experience with Chandhra, and it is on my way home from work, I will more than likely give it another shot. If next time is better, then the 1 star rating will go up."}
{"text":"This location has been so many different types of restaurants in the past and now they are cooking up some really tasty Thai food. Just hope they can stay here for awhile and not disappear like the others.

Located in the same small strip mall as Radio Shack and right next to a large movie theater. This small Mom and Pop hole in the wall delivers some very yummy and freshly cooked Thai food.

So far we have tried the fried Tofu for an appetizer and a couple of the items off the dinner menu. They also have a cool lunch special that is reasonably priced and it gives you the chance to check out some of their different styles and flavors.

Really enjoyed the Combination Seafood Soup when I was feeling stuffed up and my allergies were going crazy. It tasted delicious and my head cleared up in a heartbeat. The #18 Paht Prig Khing was also very good and came with your choice of meat and green beans in a spicy curry sauce. Decided to go with Beef and extra spicy and had to lick my plate clean.

Everything on the menu can be adjusted to the level of spice you desire. The kitchen is right in the same room with a small partition dividing it from the seating area. It is fun to watch, hear and smell the food being cooked. Nice!

Service is friendly and they make you feel right at home. Looking forward to trying out some of their noodle dishes as well as the Roasted Duck in Chili Sauce. SIMPLY DELICIOUS!

{"text":"My ex boyfriend is Thai and my ex mother in law still cooks for me, so when I look for Thai food, I look for that authentic touch that my ex's mom has. Usually my mother and I have been going to a Thai place 30 minutes from our house, so you could imagine how we felt when we found out we had a new one open right by our house! We went one day after church and the place is so cute! Very clean, staff was amazing and the energy of the place was incredible. The veggie egg rolls were homemade and to die for. We got pad Thai with chicken (my favorite) and it was big enough to share but you probably won't want to. We also got the curry, I remember they had a few different type of curries to pick from and am not quite sure which one we had but it was so tasty I wouldn't mind going thru each of the curries to find out . Definitely a 5 in my book, and we will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The waitress was rude and impatient explaining the menu which is confusing to begin with. The whole order took 1 min to make and charged 10.99. What a joke. Should have gone to Dairy Queen. I would not come back here even if it's free."}
{"text":"This reminds me of your typical China town place where you get a quick cheap bite.  Pretty much the same.  Food isn't super amazing but it's not bad either.  Price point is good.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Must say worst service ever. Tc n I both ordered food. I got mine. Waited 20 min n Tc never got his food. I had to ask waitress if he was ever going to get his food. She goes to check n then tells us they don't have the special. Seriously!!! Took 20 minutes to tell us that. Never will go again. Oh n she tells me their cook didn't come in like that makes it ok"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop Thai place. Located in a strip mall but inside is clean. Standard Thai fare. Pad Thai is one of our favorites in the Valley - the noodles are thin and sticky with not too much sauce, just the way we like it. Portions are generous. Panang curry looks bland because they don't put any garnishes on it -- however it was actually really flavorful with a hint of sweetness. There was also a generous helping of chicken in the curry. All in all a great experience -- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good. the ony thing i would say is that they need to add Pad Thai to the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Quick stop for lunch based on the reviews. Didn't have a chance to get ambitious with the menu but had quicksilver noodles with chicken and cabbage soup. Both were tasty and promptly served. There's a lot to try here so I'll be back. Nice people trying hard so show them some love!"}
{"text":"Happen to stumble upon this little gem while I was getting my nails done in the same plaza. Im sure happy I did because the food is delicious!!! So yummy and hot every time. I've been on a Thai food kick for the last 3 months and I must say this place is one of the better places I've been.They just opened January 5 and I've already been here for lunch 3 times!!! They have great lunch specials that start at $6.95!!!!! If you're in the area and are craving something yummy then stop by Chandhra Thai, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is nothing special - very disappointing dinner tonight. Based on the yelp raves I had high hopes but this place is actually a bit of a dive. 

Walked in at 8:55 tonight 5 min before closing. The restaurant is located in a bland strip shopping center next to a bar and tattoo place. 

Waitress sat me in the back and one other couple was seated and finishing their meal. The place is a bit seedy - cheaply decorated and non-descript. 

Waitress seemed far more focused on bussing the tables and cleaning rather than taking my order. After 10 minutes and not being approached I told her I was ready. 

I ordered green curry chicken but already I was not getting great vibes from this place. 

After ordering the waitress started mopping the floor before dinner and while I was eating. 

The chicken was just ok - nothing spectacular and the green beans didn't taste cooked through. My bowl of rice had flecks of rice stuck to the sides of the bowl - like the plate was never cleaned. 

Look, I can't with good conscience recommend this hole in the wall Thai tragedy."}
{"text":"That had to have been the grossest Thai I've ever eaten. My son enjoyed the vegetarian egg rolls, but he also eats dirt, so i wouldn't take his judgement seriously. On top of that, the server had given my order to another table, and instead of apologizing, and making sure they hadn't touched my food, went ahead and dropped it off at my table for me to eat. Um, Ew. Pricing is atrocious, the service is not knowledgeable about the menu or the industry period."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!!!  My absolute go to restaurant from now on.  Went in on a whim and was blown away by the beautiful decor and absolutely amazing food!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best and most authentic Thai food I've ever had. I had a lunch special for $ 6.95 and it was plenty of food. The special included soup and a spring roll. The spiciness of the dish was perfect. The staff is very warm, welcoming and helpful. I'm surprised at how much food was served for the price.

I have been to many Thai restaurants in the valley and Chandra Thai is now one of my favourites. I wish them a lot of success as I've learned they just opened a little more than a month ago. Will definitely go back."}
