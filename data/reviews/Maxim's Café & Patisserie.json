{"text":"They sell my favourite almond meringue cake here. But the service is not so good, the people there are not that friendly. Mostly take out and rarely ever sit in"}
{"text":"Maxim used to be good but in recent years really went downhill. Bought a strawberry shortcake for my fiancé's birthday and it was terrible. The cake texture was rough and grainy.  For an experienced bakery with over a decade of experience, this was absolutely unacceptable. Sad to say this, but even a cake from T&T supermarket tastes much better than Maxim."}
{"text":"I knew this cafe way back in my University days... we used to come and get the yummy pastry and go. over the years, they started serving lunch, which are normally well priced with soup, dessert and tea/coffee included. 

I come here today once again and as usual I ordered my food. I asked for a cup of water without ice (as I usually get brain freeze on ice), guess the server saw I brought my Advil with me, she brought me a cup of slightly warm water!!

The service here is usually good and the staff are really friendly. Yes, I will keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"A good patisserie with lunch and dinner services. I have lunch at least once a week; generally very tranquil and the servers are very helpful and low-key. Lunch menu is very good value for money.  Patisserie items are light and delightful. Meringue is my favourite...  The fruit flan is also delicious."}
{"text":"Visit #3 and FINAL visit:  I've been back twice since the January lunch. Their service (or lack thereof) has now been CONSISTENTLY very poor!

I got a luke-warm hot chocolate and my friend's coffee was cold. They put much less sugar in the dessert than the previous time. The toilets weren't particularly well cleaned. I will NOT be going back or recommending anyone to go to this restaurant to have a meal. Yes, their meringue dessert is delicious so take-out is a good option!

Feb visit #2 - Service very slow. The young waitress behind the counter had a \"real attitude\" problem. If I were the owner I'd be concerned... she seemed more interested in talking on her cell phone that serving paying customers. 

Jan visit #1 - Excellent service. Food fresh. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Strawberry meringue cake and mango dream cake are well-known for at this place. Great for bday cakes. I noticed that their sizes have decreased (if purchasing by slice) and their prices have rised slightly over the last few years but well worth it for special occasions."}
{"text":"A regular here, but today's HK Hot Tea (ordered two to-go) were so watered down they barely tasted like tea.  Cakes were still consistent though."}
{"text":"Honestly, this review is only for their meringue cake.
It is the best cake ever- light, fluffy, and delicious.  
We get it every time for a family member's birthday, whether it is my grandfather's, father's, brother's, sister's, etc birthday.  
One time we got it and served it at a restaurant.  We gave extra pieces to the wait staff and had all them begging us for where we got it.  Highly suggest trying this place out for the meringue cake."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Anyone who is into fine dining and especially delectable French style bakery must check out this place! My personal favourite there is: blueberry meringue."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for at least a decade for cakes on special occasions.  The mango cake is great and I've never had a cake from here I didn't like.  

They also have some sort of small connection to Maxim's bakeries in Hong Kong and I like that.  
I can't give them 5 stars because if it weren't for my parents picking up the tab here all the time I probably would find the cost to be too high."}
{"text":"First off cash only, but there's a machine there that's usable, but refuse to use it. Desserts aren't crazy, but a meringue cake lover would love their mango one. Service isn't great, so I recommend not staying there, just do take out. As I was there the woman was clipping her finger nails. Very insanitary. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it is right around the corner, but unfortunately I did not. I've been here a couple times hoping the next thing I ordered would taste better than the last (and that the service would improve -they treat you like they are doing YOU a huge favour).

The first cheese cake we bought looked beautiful but tasted horrible. My guest were spitting it out into napkins. It only had one flavour and that flavour was: EGG. yuck!

I went there for a small cappuccino (it was very bad - it just looked like hot milk and espresso stirred together, no foam) and a cookie and it ended up being $6 (a little pricey for the quality).

All in all, I wont be returning."}
{"text":"I came here last night after a satisfying meal. The plan was to pick up some desserts for my husband who was stuck at home with two crazy kids while I was given the evening for a girls' night out. 

.....Terrible way to end the night.

We showed up around 9 pm. I bought an apple custard pie. My bff bought a tiramisu cake. The total was over $40.

We decided to have a seat (it was only 30% full). The waitress (who also sold us the items) informed us that WE MUST SPEND $5 per person in order to sit down at a table. I politely said we spent over $40 on bakery items. She said, \"sorry that doesn't count\". 

So to reiterate. It's 9 pm (they close at 10). The restaurant is 30% full. We spent $40 between 3 people. .. but you won't let us sit down to have a quick chat unless we fork over $15 beforehand?

Please explain the business logic behind this. 

On to the item...

I should have asked for a refund... because the apple pie was lack lustre. I needed to slather it with vanilla ice cream in order to feel less bad for wasting both my time and money.  

Needless to say. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the cakes are not so great. The cake base is dry and simply not worth the money overall. Will not come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Apparently if you ask for extra boxes for your pastries... They start charging you cuz they're too cheap to package the pastries In individual boxes for gifts. It just gives the vibe that the restaurant is cheap. It was the owners wife who tried to weasel some extra money lol it's a shame"}
{"text":"Their meringue is the best in town. Always crunchy and fluffy with fresh fruits and whip cream. The other cakes are ok. Set menu is reasonably priced with consistent quality of food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would definitely give it to this place. This place has no shame in serving MOULDY CAKE. 
And the sour-faced lady owner/manager doesn't care about the customers. 

I've been to this place a few times with my mom and she picked this place for me to take her on Mother's Day.  The food was okay up until the dessert, which is what they are supposedly famous for.

My mom got a set menu and it came with a daily dessert, but she wanted a specific cake so she ordered it separate and I took her set menu dessert. I noticed that everyone who ordered the set menu was getting this chocolate mousse cake, so I was looking forward to that, but what ended up coming was something different. I didn't care that it was different, I just wanted something sweet. When I bit into it it had a mouldy taste and I thought maybe they just overburnt the sugar topping on top. So I took a few more bites and my mom even tried it, agreeing that it had a mouldy taste. I dissected the cake until I flipped it over and saw several LARGE GREEN SPOTS OF MOULD!!!

The first waitress we reported it to denied it and just brought me the chocolate mousse cake I had expected, but I didn't eat it because I was already disgusted. Then the second waitress profusely apologized and gave us 10% off. But it's not her job to apologize for MOULDY CAKE!! It's the owner/manager's job and not ONCE did she come to the table to apologize. The 10% is great but it won't help me when I'm sitting on the toilet all night.

I really wish I could have taken a picture of the cake to report them, but I was just so shocked and disgusted it is one of those \"in-hindsight I should have done this and that\" scenario.

Needless to say, we are never coming back here and if you want to be treated with respect, I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere. You can find better food at any of the joints nearby at the Leslie and Finch plaza."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents. The karaoke dinner here is awesome. A small amount of people with constant good music. Anyone can sing and the pianist is professional. The service is friendly and the food is very decent. There is a soup of the day. The dessert especially is out of the world. The cake here is the best in the area. The owner is a chill guy. It's just a good place to chill and enjoy slow songs. The mood is really nice. Most people sing old love songs here. The decorations Are on point. People here and regulars are super nice people. If you're not shy, you can even go up and sing a song for everyone. The bar here is nice too. Only minus is that the cake takeout section seems like a different store. If the take out side had more atmosphere itd be better."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. They have the best cakes ever. They have the best meringue in town. I had meringues in other places and it's always not has crunchy and fluffy. They always have fresh cakes and they also not as sweet as other places. A lot of sweets you end up wanting to drink water after first couple of bites. But not at Maxims. 

As too their lunch and dinner, it's very good for their price. Very tasty. They have really good lamb and curry. Dropping by for lunch is always an option for me because it's quick and delicious. 

They also have excellent customer service.  They know what you want and bring it to the table right away. They give good recommendations as to what cake to get  for birthdays and weddings. 

I love it how it's more a family-oriented restaurant. The owner is really outspoken and kind. It's good to support small businesses."}
{"text":"I have been going to Maxim's since I was young and have always loved it here. I recall pretty much every single one of my bday cakes coming from Maxim. The only issue is that much favourite cake from here is their strawberry meringue cake and growing up I could never order it for my birthday cake as it is not a cake that is easy to cut. If you only have to share the cake with 5-6 people than it is fine but anymore and it would be impossible due to the nature of the cake. Otherwise, any of their other cakes are delish! 

If you ever come for lunch or dinner they typically have a set menu where a slice of cake comes with it for dessert. However I am not sure if the meringue cakes are part of it. 

Like most reviews say definitely come for their cakes!

On this visit hubby and I each ordered a slice of cake and had a drink. Their cafe side was nice. So I can only speak to that. Service was decent as they refilled our waterrs periodically as well."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. It's unfortunate I had to rate a 1 star to submit this review. My cousin and I went to Maxim's today and was waiting to be seated. I had crutches and she had a stroller. The staff behind the counter saw us but did not come to seat us. It was not busy. I guess there were some people seated that they knew, cause next thing we know, there was a lady coming out, so we thought she was going to seat us. But she ended up just chatting with the people instead. The girl behind the counter finally came and said \"hello\" to us as we were leaving. The staff did not seem to care about their lack of service, nor did management. To the management staff of Maxim, I hope you do read this review and resolve this issue with your staff, because you should know you are not the only bakery/cafe in the area, and at this rate, it won't matter if your meringue cakes are good. Your food and drink prices are too expensive for what you are serving, and if you continue on with the lack of service, pretty soon, your competition will over take you. I will not be returning here again. Business is all about word of mouth. I'm sure I'm not the only one here who feels this way about your poor service."}
{"text":"I came here with extremely low expectations because of all the poor Yelp reviews. I had to pick up a birthday cake and the boyfriend suggested we give their sit down menu a try.

The set menu comes with salad, soup, main and your choice of cake. My favorite its the meringue and I think that's what Maxim is known for.

The food was not amazing, but with dessert in mind, I might have ate too fast. 

Service is quick and the food arrived quickly too. It almost feels like you're in a fast food restaurant but with nicer decor. 

The interior is very dark though - my mom had to use the flashlight on her phone to read the menu. 

Overall, this place is A-OK, I would come back all the time just for cake!"}
{"text":"It's a small cafe. Really nice. The  meringue is really good but a bit to sweet. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great price - 3 course meal for less than $20 per person.

First course, soup or salad.  We all chose tomato cream (the other one was chicken something).

Second course as in pictures.

Third course is cake.  Full slice from cut cake no less.  You can switch by paying extra.  Since there're four of us we didn't bother.  We just share all 4 flavours.

Service is good.  Great ambience.

I probably will return even though it is out of my way."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the strawberry meringue cake! It's not too sweet like some reviewers have said. I have noticed that it's not as good as it used to be, but still worth it. The meringue cake here is better than the Bayview location, in my opinon.

I've eaten the food food here once and it was mediocre at best. Best to just get a cake to go."}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten their strawberry meringue cake from Maxim's and it's always been consistently decent. Although it's not the best I've had but it's great to know what to expect. 

The service has always been consistently mediocre. I don't want to dismiss the issue stating that it's a Chinese run place so it's expected to be poor because that's just an excuse. 

I would recommend the strawberry meringue cake. Can't say much about anything else."}
{"text":"When I'm back in town, this place is a must for their meringue. On a good day, they'll have the strawberry, mango or blueberry meringue cakes available.

The restaurant is fairly casual looking and I don't like how the dining area isn't really separated from the casual fast-plate section (their previous layout before the reno was much better). The service is decent when you go later in the evening for just desserts. I love coming here for post dinner desserts when you don't want to go drinking or out for bubble tea, it's always casual and quiet.

As long as they keep making the meringue cakes, I'll always come back. Unless they open a branch in Vancouver? :o"}
{"text":"This place, is all about their meringue cakes.

My favorites are strawberry and mango meringue here. 

The dining and food is about average and nothing too special in my opinion. I just like to go here for cakes and coffee, those are the best."}
{"text":"Mediocre products. Mediocre service. Nothing special and I probably won't be back. 

If all you're expecting is a basic piece of cheesecake, then maybe you'd enjoy it but I like flavourful and rich baked goods. Plus they were overpriced for the bland flavour."}
{"text":"Been going here for their fruit Meringue Cakes since I can remember! They can be ordered by piece and as a full cake with six or eight slices depending on the size desired.  Their other cakes are also very good and not overly sweet!  Their Meringue Cake (strawberry, blueberry, mango, or mixed) is still our all-time go-to favourite!"}
{"text":"Seems like their main thing here is the meringue cake. Since that's not my thing, I can't really give them a high rating, the experience and the service is not that great. Also everyone seems to have recognized the sour-faced lady owner/manager, who is not very pleasant. I remember my experience with her before, where I told her the mussels in my pasta dish was not fresh and mushy/crumbly. Of course she proceeds to tell me that it's the freshest mussels evs and it's obviously a problem on my end. Can't believe they charge so much for their meals. You might as well go to a decent Western place for this price instead of this Asian-style western food.

So my partner suggested we give them another try after 10+ years of boycott. Although the decor got an update, the people and service have not changed. Seemed to be a very popular place for their cakes, especial popular amongst the older Asian ladies who tend to favor cakes with less sugar. The whole time we were there people were in and out getting cakes. 

We ordered a French onion soup and it was served with complementary garlic bread... Oooo... a pleasant surprise and it was good. The soup however is a disappointment. Sitting at a price of $8, there needs to be some sort of standards. The portion was painfully small, the cheese on top of poor quality and there's a small piece of bread in there looks like day old baguette. I ordered the garlic tiger shrimp pasta in tomato sauce. I didn't have high hopes for \"tiger shrimps\", since a lot of restaurants called their shrimps tiger when they are not. And these were not, but at least they were fresh. The sauce was interesting it was tomatoey, and I think they added crab eggs in it, which was interesting and added a nice texture. Otherwise, the decor was blah, the ambience meh and service okay... And sour face lady didn't help."}
{"text":"A couple of times I've ordered their tarts, I noticed they were stale.
So I've stopped coming here.  Their cakes are ok, but if I'm eating a cake with lots of calories, it might as well be sweet.

The mango cake is probably the best one if you had to choose one.
Chinese desserts are not very good!  I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"4 stars for cakes 
2 stars for food 

My MIL loves loves loves the meringue cakes from this place. Without any exaggeration, she'd be happy to have the blueberry meringue for breakfast, mango for lunch, and strawberry for dinner. Mmmm, fresh cream and fruit pieces whipped together, oozing between two layers of delicate and crunchy meringue, crumble-to-the-touch and melt-in-your-mouth goodness. 

The food, on the other hand, is neither here nor there. The cooking style is supposed to be French, but enough French-ness is missing let's just say it's nondescript and rather bland food. 

Definitely go there for the cake. Meringue is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Went to the cafe yesterday to get takeout. I always only purchase the meringue, and nothing else. 

In terms of service, I find the servers have a bit of an attitude. As I usually get takeout, it doesn't affect me that much, but it is one of the reasons why I don't dine in there. Because I always take out, I can't really comment much on anything. 

The presentation of the food was excellent. it feels really high end. The quality of the food was also excellent."}
{"text":"I've only had take out cake from here, but many many times. So in May, I had it at least 3-4 times. It was always delicious. But most recently, their meringue has gone down SO MUCH in quality.

The meringue was not crunchy as usual. Instead it was soggy. And within the meringue, the cream had almost NO fruit. So cheap of them!

Even worse, the lady insisted that they made them freshly today. So we were expecting the usual deliciousness. However it seemed like they actually had saved these pieces from yesterday... No good!!!!!!!

Bring back the quality of your cake!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is just a bit of a word of warning for anyone showing up and expecting sweets and cakes from a typical cake shop.   Everything here is geared towards a Asian taste bud, which means, lighter, fluffier and significantly much less sweet.  Now this is fine, if that's what you're looking for, but just to illustrate, a few years back for my birthday a bunch of friends had bought two extra \"Asian\" cakes (it was a black forest cake and probably a mango something something).

We couldn't finish them all so I brought it in to work and gave it to my staff.  I warned them all that it's probably not what they're expecting, but as soon as I saw their expressions taking a bite of their cake, I said it was ok to not swallow it and chuck it out, and every single person tossed their slice in the garbage with a sigh of relief.  Then they all proceeded to the Tim Horton's where I bought them donuts.

Sooo.. if you're looking for Asian style cakes, then fine.  But I've kind of forgotten that the Tiramisu here is NOTHING like a Tiramisu! So buyer be warned."}
{"text":"Lunch with Chris.  Delicious food.  The Green Tea Mousse Cake with white chocolate was different and tasty.  I will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch with my family of 6. Their lunch specials range from $12-14 and include choice of soup or salad, an entree (fish/pork tenderloin/ox tail/spaghetti), tea/coffee/hk milk tea, and a slice of cake. The starters came out really quickly but we waited a noticeably long time for the entrees. The entrees arrived hot and all at the same time but didn't taste particularly good. The dessert was mango cake. I didn't like it since I thought the crumb was too coarse and a little dry. However, my brother and dad felt it was the best part of their meal. 

It's a casual atmosphere with an interior that is kind of dark. It was pretty clean though.

15% gratuity is included for parties of 6 or more."}
{"text":"I went to Karaoke on Friday nights at Maxim's.  I sang my heart out till 1:00am.  Tuesdsay nights , they have a rock band that comes and plays.  I like their strawberry short cake and their mango"}
{"text":"So I checked the website this morning and it said they close at 12am on weekends. I called and they said they close at 11pm. I allowed that because tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and I understand if they want to close early. At 8:40pm, I called to make a dessert reservation for that night. I was told they close at 9:30pm. I told the person who answered the phone that I had called earlier and that the person who had answered the phone said the close at 11pm today. She said that 9:30pm was last call for orders. That being the case, I went. The three of us ordered three slices of cake to eat in, and one to take out. First problem of the night was that they don't split bills, even if we order at the counter and then get seated (we had to choose our own table). Second problem was that they did not provide us with water. No one came to our table to ask us whether we were even interested in beverages. Third problem was that around 9:45, the waitress said they had to close the cash register, so we had to pay right then. Minimum 10% tip required...on a party of 3. The only thing they had done was bring us our plates. We still had no drinks. At around 9:50pm, we were the last table occupied, and the waiters started to give us evil eye. At 10:05pm, they came up to us and told us they needed to close, and thus, kicked us out of the restaurant. At the end of about an hour there, we still never got drinks.

I highly doubt I would ever voluntarily come to eat in again, but their meringues are still delicious, so take-out?"}
{"text":"Cakes 4 Star
Service 1- 3 Star (depending who you get)
Dining 3 Star

Randomly located on Finch Avenue in a 1 level small strip plaza one wonders who on earth would come here for cake. Somehow I did and I'm quite happy about it despite a few things.

I've been to this bakery numerous times and when you first walk in you actually realize it is a Bakery/Restaurant which is sectioned off by a fish tank (a bit odd) further to the back of the establishment.
decor could use some work. Maybe a little too many personal touches where they should have hired a interior designer. Dining here is a hit or miss, most dishes are fairly good and a few are barely a pass but for an Asian place trying to past off French Food and Bakery their dishes are quite good. I really get a sense that a lot of effort and care is put into the food. Which gives me a vibe that this place is run by some snobberish foodie. (not a bad thing unless it becomes more snobberish than the latter) 

The service as other reviewers have mentioned is grade a Snotty. The staff here has a VERY authentic HK (Hong Kong) charm and customer service. Especially the guy that runs the bakery alone and wears glasses, he is something *special*. With service like his it feels more like I'm walking in to a cheap Chinese diner than a bakery where I've been treated far better.
But honestly what were they thinking hiring that dude. People who usually buy cakes are in a joyous mood trying to celebrate a joyous occasion. He's just very depressing not just once or twice but consistently stand offish and rude in my experiences.

Despite the bad service the cakes here are good. Please do yourself a service and come for the cake and try to limit your interactions with the Man in dark rimmed glasses cause he's a bit of a buzz kill. If it weren't for the Meringue Cakes here I would not come back as often as I do. Which each time I have to muse up enough confidence and face that horrible snotty man but it's worth it in the end when I'm reunited with my Crunchy Creamy Meringue Cake and all is right with the world for that moment. :D"}
{"text":"The two servers behind the cake counter were more interested in looking at their schedule than helping waiting customers. My family has been going to Maxim's for at least 15 years for their cakes. I'm not sure if management has changed since they moved to a different unit in the same plaza, but my most recent experience was disappointing. Hope their meringue cake is still worth it."}
{"text":"The service standards of this cafe has drastically dropped. In the past, this restaurant positioned itself as fine dining. But as I walked in the door at nine thirty for desserts with my friends, the waitress decided to tell us that they have decided to close early because there isn't enough business. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Felt very unwelcome from the beginning. They rushed us to make an order, never came by to refill our water until we asked them--when there were only 4 other people in the restaurant. The paella was bland...not surprising considering they couldn't even pronounce their own menu items correctly.

Finally the dessert... I didn't realize it was possible but they managed to make mousse cake soggy and gross. Not surprising given all the poor hygiene reviews here. To top it all off, they added an automatic gratuity. Very disingenuous practice that can lead to double tipping if you don't inspect your bill correctly. Would not go back, ever."}
{"text":"There really is no better place for Meringue. This is by far the best place I've had for meringue in Toronto. The mango meringue is my favorite.

I've also come here for like weekend lunch once too over a holiday. The food was average, but the three course meal (soup, entree and dessert) for like $15 is like a super deal, while everywhere else around the city is like price gouging over the same holiday.

The service, was decent enough. Just a fan of the meringue."}
{"text":"Why there is NO STAR option in the setting?! One star is already too much. I ordered their well known meringue in the restaurant. The first bite was alright, but during my second one, I pulled one strand of hair out from the filling/icing. And no, I was sure it wasnt my hair. Oh dear it was gross. Service wise? HORRIBLE ++++. The eldest lady in the restaurant, who I believe was the boss, was just sitting there, whispering, critizing and talking bad stuffs about others to employees in cantonese; and assuming I wouldn't understand  because I'm indian! I grew up in HONG Kong so I know cantonese! To conclude, never going back again."}
{"text":"Great place for desserts and good conversations! Not much customer service from the staffs, even when the place is empty."}
{"text":"Maybe go to this place for the baked goods. The cakes are reasonably priced and not too sweet like most Asian bakeries. The strawberry and mango meringue cakes are my favorite. I've had dinner there only a couple of times. They have set menus. The food is average and service is average."}
{"text":"I came for afternoon tea.  The meals were around 5-9$+tax & tip including coffee or tea (if I remember correctly).  The pricing and environment was nice. Coffee was good.  Beef brisket spaghetti was fairly cheap, taste was OK as well.   Fries and wings were alright, could have used more salt.  Green tea cheesecake was overly sweet for my liking but with black coffee it was bearable.  I would come back just because the environment was nice for afternoon tea with perhaps a cake that was less sweet.

Oops...I went to Richmond Hill location, not Finch location...But will give it a try sometime"}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times and only for one thing, meringue cake. It's the best meringue cake in the city probably. and the rest of their cakes are really good as well! 
However, the service is terrible, the people behind the counter are rude and generally could careless if people came in or not. The dinner service is also not good. Their menu sounds like it's italian or french food, but it's not. It's chinese people trying to make italian food similar to Firefly (on hwy 7) and it's not better then what you can likely make at home.
Their hours are sketchy as hell, as in, they may or may not be open until the time listed and sometimes if you walk in later in the evening around 8:40 or later, the people behind the counter will be very rude and seem impatient then tell you they're closing at 9:30 or 'earlier' so that you'll be deterred from staying (happened to me on three separate occasions).

**The take home message is - only drop in to pick up a cake/dessert TO GO, because if you stay, you will not be a happy customer**"}
{"text":"On my previous visit, for desserts only, their lunch menu piqued my interest so I just had to come back and try their food.

They offer a wide range of interesting specials for lunch, including Braised Short Rib or Lamb Shank, Green Curry Chicken, Wagyu Burger, Pasta, and more. Most items are $18 or less. Good deal.

All the lunch specials include a bowl of soup or a salad, a slice of one of their famous cakes, coffee, or tea. Great deal! The cakes are usually around $6 by itself!

We both started with the salad. The greens were fresh and it had just the right amount of dressing. I ordered the Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Cognac Sauce and my dining companion, Raj N., ordered the Braised Short Rib. They were served with rice and vegetables. Both entrees tasted good, above average but not spectacular.

The desserts, on the other hand, were excellent. This is what they're famous for. Raj had a slice of Green Tea Mousse cake and I had a coffee flavoured slice. Yummm! We also had coffee, which was included.

I still don't know what the other reviewers are talking about regarding bad service. It was busy when we were there and we had nothing to complain about. The service was good.

Overall, it was a very good lunch and a great value. We'll definitely be back, with more friends!"}
{"text":"Cakes are good, but service is bad!  I usually come here for take out cake only.

Don't even try to call them to pre-order a cake.  They will ask you to call back for the following reason, (1) If you can't speak Chinese, then they need to find someone who can speak in English, (maybe you can ask your Chinese friend to help you); (2) I can speak Cantonese, but they told me that they are too busy, and they don't have time to write down my order..."}
{"text":"I had dinner here - it was pretty good and the service I received was also pretty good. The quality of food was decent, I had a pasta dish that was pretty decent (it was basil and had something else)  It's a weird set up though, a bakery/restaurant sectioned off by large salt water tanks... that's just weird and the decor could use a bit of an update. It's a great place for desert though.. I had the best macarons here - so great, and very unexpected, light and crunchy with just the right amount of ganache to hold it together. I LOVED the macarons..Get the deserts here - I think I would have skipped dinner if I knew the quality of deserts offered, and would have been happy to do so."}
{"text":"I've gone here on several occasions and I've felt compelled to write a review of this place.  

Lunches: 
Nothing special.  They range in price from $10-20 and aren't particularly good.  The stupid thing about their lunches is that they choose the dessert for you.  So on several occasions, they've chosen the cheapest, most unflattering dessert for their patrons...all of which I've eaten a bite off and had enough. 

Christmas dinner: $42/person - prix fixe 
DON'T EVER GO.  That is all I have to say...and here is why

a) Salad & appetizer - coleslaw w/  Norwegian Smoked Salmon & Duck Confit
Coleslaw was nothing special at all.  It lacked flavour and taste.  The duck confit was not tender at all and also lacked taste and was quite bland.  As for the smoked salmon, it didn't taste that great at all.  Just ordinary normal smoked salmon. 

b) Soup - Lobster bisque w/ puff pastry
By puff pastry, they mean a random block of phyllo puff on your soup just randomly floating around.  The lobster bisque was absolutely horrible being that it seemed like it was mixed with corn starch to thicken the soup and watered down because they were too cheap to make a real lobster bisque.  I couldn't bring myself to finish that thing and drank less than half of this soup. 

c) 1st course - half de-boned quail in cranberry sauce 
First of all, my quail was most definitely boned.  Second of all, they gave you a little quail thigh.  The cranberry sauce was minimal and I honestly wondered where it was as I was eating the quail.  Quail was also very chewy and lacked tenderness and flavour. 

d) Entrees - New Zealand Rack of Lamb OR US Choice Filet Mignon w/ Goose Liver Pate OR Lobster & seafood Pasta OR Filet of Grouper with Sauteed Scallop

I had 3 out of 4 entrees to try.  The NZ rack of lamb was NOT cooked to perfect and the rosemary sauce and other gravies they put onto the lamb absolutely ruined it for me.  The sauce made the lamb taste like dish detergent so I'm not sure what Rosemary sauce was used but rosemary does NOT taste like that.  

The US Choice Filet mignon was NOT actual filet mignon.  It was chewy, untender, and had gravy splattered all over it.  What is worse is that it had goose liver pate on TOP of the filet mignon.  I thought it was going to be off on the side but that pate was slathered on the filet mignon as if the filet mignon was toast or something.  The pate was disgusting and totally ruined the taste of the filet mignon.  Also, the gravy splattered over it made it even worse.  What made me even more upset was that the side consisted of a frozen vegetable assortment of corn, peas, and beans.  Honestly, it was as if it was dumped out of a Green Giant bag and dumped onto my plate.  

The grouper also was hard boiled and lacked any flavour at all.  There was a total of one scallop in that whole dish.  Also green giant vegetables.  

e) All you can eat dessert & coffee/tea
Dessert was the only thing that was great.  Their meringue is one of the best meringues that I have ever had and they've honestly perfected that to a T.  Their best merignques are the mocha meringue and the strawberry meringue.  Their jam cookie is also great - which consists of a shortbread sandwiched with strawberry jam and sprinkled with icing sugar.  

For $42 per person, I thought that was an absolute waste of my time and money.  Their service, although not horrible, was not particularly great and had they not already slapped a 15% gratuity on their bill, I would not have given that at all.  The food was just unpleasant that night and thank goodness their meringue made the experience slightly less unpleasant.  I think my whole family has agreed that we will NEVER come back here for any dinners because we all feel as if their Christmas dinner, they've skimped out a lot.  I'm not paying $42 again to drink watered down lobster bisque and not-real filet mignon.  

2 stars.  Will not return unless I'm buying pastries for take-out."}
{"text":"Cute cafe :)  We came here just to grab some cakes to go so didn't stay, but definitely roomy enough to be a nice sit-down place.  There was quite a wide collection of different assortments of cakes, though I was told their cheesecakes weren't the best.  I had a slice of the mango meringue and a slice of strawberry meringue.  My favourite was mango, this was a super crumbly cake and goes so well with coffee :3  Would definitely go back to try another one of their pretty cakes!  Price was $20-40 for entire cakes (not sure about how much per slice, though.. but since it's an Asian place, you do probably get your money's worth)"}
{"text":"It's only for the meringue cake that I will come here. Tried their restaurant once. It was just OK. Nothing special. It was western food with an Asian touch. The service is not that great. I called in once to order a meringue cake for my cousin's birthday. I sent my boyfriend to pick it up for me. They didn't have the cake. They wrote down the numeric date but not the day. So she wrote February 12th but not Sunday. So when my boyfriend showed up on Sunday to get the cake they didn't have it because she thought February 12th is Monday. They offered me a 20% discount which was useless at the time. PLUS they never gave the 20% after. 

Also for the baked goods i believe dont take credit card."}
{"text":"This place's cake is a ABSOLUTE FAIL. 

We have a party of 4 went in there on a Sat night, we ordered:

New York cheesecake
Mocha cheesecake
Strawberry shortcake
Nepolean cake

Out of the four, Nepolean is the only one that is a bit decent. The cheesecakes are absolutely fail, don't ever eat them unless you have no other food left in earth. Why? We found eggshell pieces in the Mocha cheesecake, not just one small pieces but lots of them!!

The New York Cheesecake taste extremely 'eggy', and both cheesecake have no crust to compliment the cheese cream. 

The portion size? Only half of what you get at any cake shop, and you pay $5 for it. 

Strawberry shortcake? They have rum in the mix but they mix it so bad that you don't even taste the layer of the cake. It is absolutely horrible. I have better strawberry shortcake from Loblaws.

Nepolean is the ONLY one that is decent but then it's nothing special because it's just layers of pastry.

I would totally give this place's cake a negative 5 out of 3. That's how bad it is.

I would never go back there again."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. It's been probably 10 years since I've been back for dinner. Prices have gone up and they seem to be going for the more fancy approach. Our servers were great and very patient with my group. We got comp garlic bread which was more like plain bread as they totally cheaped out on the butter/garlic. In terms of the decor, it needs more of an update. Some areas in the restaurant are too dim. 

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Pasta with rosé sauce. The portion was a bit small imho. It was tasty and there were no regrets ordering. The smoked salmon was fresh and came with three large slices. 

Since the late 80s, my family and I usually only purchased the Strawberry Meringue cake for special occasions. It is absolutely to die for and was always my birthday cake growing up. It's a little messy when cutting but just delicious!"}
{"text":"Got a chocolate cheesecake for my birthday and boy is was disgusting. It was not sweet but sour which makes me wonder how old it was. Truly disappointed. Hopefully their other cakes are better"}
{"text":"Came here for the  meringue cake that everyone raves about.  It was good (strawberry) but the reason why it's one star is 100% service.  We all expect sub par service at Asian restaurants but this was just next level. What a chore it was to order.  We were one of two tables...  I'd suggest just taking out the cake."}
{"text":"My mom told me we were having dinner here last Friday and while trying to search up the menu, I stumbled across all these terrible Yelp reviews of the place.

I warned my mother that the service was said to be garbage and not to have high hopes for this place.

The menu is not very extensive but does cover the range from pasta to steak with your Hong Kong twist.  It is an extra $8 to upgrade to a full meal - such as having soup, salad, coffee/tea, and a dessert.  Get the $8, it is well worth it.

The soup and salad were very average - nothing to complain or to write home about.  

My seafood pasta came packed with large delicious shrimps.  I honestly think the shrimps rivalled the amount of pasta in my bowl.  There were no complaints from my other family members either.  The steak, the lamb, and the oxtail were bomb (I stole from their plates obviously).

The desserts you were able to select from the front where all the cakes were laid out. I actually love the mille cake and I've hated it everywhere else.  & obviously we had the meringue cake - we actually come here every year to order this cake for my mom for her birthday.  No complaints still.

1 star off for the prices as I do think this restaurant is reaching a little bit to be a more fancy English/HK twist that's usually meant to be a tea café place and it isn't quite there yet."}
{"text":"3.5

It's half restaurant and half cafe. When you first walk in you will be welcomed by a showcase of different cakes that lures your eyes..then your feet deeper. I've been here once a long time ago, but I had never tried dinner. So this was the first.

The staff were kind and they were all guys too. (just an observation)

I had the Soup of the Day, which was creamy spinach. It was not bad, but tasted a bit bland. I liked the consistency of the soup. Nice creaminess! 

The salad was nothing special, BUT this was the first time I tried 'heart of palm' which is exactly what it sounds like. It was delicious! A nice soft crunchy texture sort of like bamboo shoots in those vegetarian dishes. 

I also tried the alfredo topped with a sliced portobello mushroom. The alfredo was not as creamy as I hoped it to be, but it was not bad.. I'm not much of a fan of alfredo. It has to be outstanding for me to like it, haha. And the mushroom tasted like a regular portobello mushroom which was on the bland side. Didn't season it enough. 

However, the * of the show was dessert. It came on the tackiest PLASTIC plate LMFAO. BUT, it was seriously absolutely amazing. I had the Blueberry Meringue... Oh my goodness. I've never had meringue before. God, it was so damn light and fluffy with the whipped cream in the middle mixed with fresh blueberries along with (my mouth is literally watering) a crunchy yet delicate cloud of... just egg whites... like something so simple created to taste out of this world. UGH, I LOVE FOOD. I LOVE DESSERTS. You guys HAVE to try this.

Overall:  Blueberry Meringue."}
{"text":"They've been here FOREVER. 
I feel ancient just thinking about it. 

Once upon a time over 15 years ago their blueberry meringue cake was famous and to-die-for because quantity and quality were generous and they did not skimp on size, cream, butter, sugar, fruit, portion balance, etc. But now, just like most mom-and-pop restaurant businesses and lesser-known fastfood franchises in the GTA that serve/sit 30-50 people, something's gotta give in a less-than-stellar economy topped with a high cost of living.

Their meringue cake, black forest, white chocolate, cheesecake, etc are now sub par in quality and quantity, and prices can only grow larger while slices only shrink smaller. 

Maxim's tries to survive in other creative ways such as offering weekend oldies music lounge performances which is pretty nice if you want to take your momma out somewhere for \"After Eight\" fun and entertainment. But beyond that, you can pick up better meringue, cakes, and pastries in other cafes and high end grocery stores. How they survive is reliance on middle class old Bayview neighbourhood regulars and their next of kin to stop by. The retired doctors, lawyers, ex-pats, entrepreneurs and private school-educated folks who've lived in the area since before the 90s.

Some advice: If you are going to continue and charge a fine dining price, you should update your melamine plates and serve your desserts on finer tableware (i.e., the breakable kind)."}
{"text":"The service is bad, and usually is bad.
Therefore, I only come here for take out because the cake is always good. 
the price of the cake is not expensive.  if you like the cake not sweet, this is the place to go.
Recommend  Meringue cake, strawberry tart."}
{"text":"The extraordinary politeness and manner of the North York Maxim's Cafe manage: \"Your cake won't be flipped (by my staffs) unless it's your car that flip over\". This comment was said to my mom in the face when she expressed her concerns about the cake falling off/flip over. 

This manager is a tall mid-40 ~ 50 man who speaks Cantonese. His comment is beyond rude, disrespectful, and insolent in every way. This one-star review could have been saved up if there's a 0-star option. No one deserves to be treated wrongfully and disrespectfully."}
{"text":"It's alright, alittle overpriced. I got a box of macaroons, their mango meringue cake, hot chocolate and  my friend got their fruit cheesecake with honey lemon tea. This was my mistake but both the hot chocolate as well as the cake had a ridiculous amount of heavy cream and I couldn't finish the cake because I felt like barfing. It would've been a better idea to get a tea to lighten things up but I took it home and my mother loved it.  My friend ended up having diarrhea from her cheesecake! The macaroons were not well made and did not look very presentable but I guess it's because it's not their specialty. It was $12 for 5. The cake slices were $6-8 got chocolate  was $4.50."}
{"text":"4 stars for their cakes. I have always loved their cakes. Especially the meringue - but also their strawberry shortcake. They are made more for Asian tastes so they are not super sweet, which I appreciate. The cookies are kind of overpriced but I can't help but get suckered into getting one or two when I come here and see them in the window!

Food-wise...it's ok. I had a pasta here once, it was nothing to write home about. Superwoman got the curry which was actually quite good! The meal combos with cake is great value, but when we come here, 9.9 times out of 10, we are getting cake for some special occasion. And you should, too!"}
{"text":"I really love the meringue cake at Maxim's... super light meringue and whipped cream filling w blueberries, mangos or strawberries. Liike the other reviewer mentioned, these are definitely asian-style cakes. Don't come here expecting rich, decadent  fillings because none of them are that, not even their cheesecake (which I tried and didn't really like). I do like that their cakes aren't overly sweet though.

Their service is sucky.. indifferent and borderline rude, especially from any of the females. There was a younger guy who used to work here and was really nice but I haven't seen him in the past few times I've come.

I came here today to pick up a cake for a small get together for my parents and another couple, both couples celebrating their 35th anniversary. I chose an 8\" cake and asked the lady if she could put \"Happy 35th Anniversary\" on it and so she wrote it on a white choco plaque. I got home, my mom wanted to take a look so I opened it up and this is what we see ... \"Happy 35th Anniverstry\" ...!! 

 I suppose this is why she didn't show it to me before boxing it up and I didn't bother to ask, but seriously?? That's low.. She just had to grab another choco plaque, not redo a whole cake. I need to find another cake place in my hood.. i'm feeling less and less love for this place as time goes by."}
{"text":"4/5 Soley for their cakes.. the meringue cakes to be more specific. They're so fresh, fruity, and the meringue is so poofy and crunchy. I've also had the Hazelnut Mocha. It was pretty good. I didn't expect so many nuts in the cream filling but it was a good surprise. It was a very natural mocha taste too which I enjoyed."}
