{"text":"Bought a Deluxe Chirashi Don and a pack of sushi. The fish are very fresh. In the chriashi don, it has about four pieces of uni(sea urchins), a lot of fish roes and two shrimps and half of my container is filled with rice. The portion is generous. This is very good. I will come back again. The only thing is they only have two seats available. You probably have to buy take out and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a poké bowl! The service is great and the staff are extremely friendly. The shop is conveniently located near Sheppard subway station and only seats two at a time (it is more of a take-away restaurant). You can purchase pre-made sushi sets or order food. For the bowl, there is an interesting ordering process which required for me to select my choices on a sheet of paper and hand it over to the cashier.  For the food, the poké bowl was decent. I found that there was way too much rice and the bowl was dry with the insufficient sauce and toppings they added. There are definitely less options for rice and toppings compared to other poké places. However, it is definitely very filling with the amount of rice they give.  Toppings I recommend: avocado, tempura bits, seaweed salad, sesame seeds  Overall, it is definitely higher priced for decent quality."}
{"text":"ehhh, this place is overpriced for what you get. Poke eats has better bowls! i wanted to explore different poke bowls, but wouldn't go back to this place."}
{"text":"After having seen the mouthwatering photos of the quality sashimi from this place surface on Yelp, I was determined to try this place out and I finally got the chance last week!    I ordered the salmon, ikura, uni don and as anticipated, it was very fresh and delicious. The uni melted in my mouth and the ikura pearls were large and juicy. The salmon was tasty too, but it wasn't anything special. Overall, I was very content with the food here but I felt that the portioning could've been better. For $17 (after tax), I only got 3 pieces of uni, 5 pieces of salmon, and about 2 tablespoons of ikura.    Since this small shop caters mostly towards quick \"grab and go\" takeout, I felt that the price was fairly steep for the amount of food I got. I wasn't fully satisfied at the end of my meal so I'm not sure I'd so easily drop $17 on it again.   Having tried it once is good enough for me!"}
{"text":"The Uni- torched scallop roll with gold flakes caught my eye while searching on Yelp to find a take out place in the area.  Got the regular roll of 8 pieces for $23 (made fresh to order). Great signature roll! Uni & scallops were fresh, and their individual flavour & texture complimented each other very well!  The staff was really friendly. They offered to display the roll without the lid, so I could take a picture of their best selling roll."}
{"text":"This new spot is more for take out as only two seats.   The Japan Eats roll is very creative and unique. The combination of scallop and uni went well together. The scallop was slightly torched. On the menu, it indicated $23.00 for 8 pieces but in the fridge you can get 4 pieces that is ready made.   I've also tried the Tsukiji Inari, and one piece was stuffed with Alaskan king crab, the others were with salmon roe. Flavour was not bad but personally I find it a little too much rice though. However, the chef indicated that they are modifying and will make it smaller with less rice.   The service was good, owner was very informative and polite. Friendly service. I will recommend this place to my friends and will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place was really good, my bf got the deluxe chirashi and it was loaded with premium ingredients, all of which were super fresh. I especially liked the otoro - it melts in your mouth! I got the tuna poke bowl and while it was good, the chirashi is def better! I would come back to try their other dons."}
{"text":"Best poke bowls in the area! I love the build your own with ube rice. Portions are good size and ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Came here again to order their party tray, they add a new menu of TORCH item which I love so much. Tried the shrimp oshisushi which is amazing with melt cream cheese and mango, a classic combination"}
{"text":"My new favourite sashimi joint! This place is quietly tucked away in the new plaza at Yonge and shep across from whole foods. There isn't any parking but you can find residential parking nearby. I came here specifically for the uni with rice and it was awesome! This place is a bit on the pricey side but it's because you're getting quality fish. They mostly do take outs but there are two spots to sit. Will come back and get the sushi platters to go next time!  Update: the second time I came back the owner recognized us and gave us two free mini bluefin tuna hand rolls! So good."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a meatless option for dinner and recalled seeing photos on Yelp that Japan Eats recently opened. Located close to Yonge and Sheppard, it is a convenient option (if not during rush hour traffic) located close to the 401. There is underground parking for the building.   We ordered the salmon poke bowl and tuna poke bowl. I liked that the tuna bowl had seasoned sushi rice, garlic chips, kale, seaweed salad, corn, cabbage and avocado and that they offered the flexibility of changing my sauce from wasabi to spicy sauce (same as what is included with the salmon poke bowl). Hubby felt that for $1 more, the tuna poke bowl is a better value over the salmon poke bowl.  The poke bowls are more expensive than the signature bowls at nearby Poke Eats ($12.99). They even offer lobster or king crab poke bowls ($21.99). What I like about this place is that it offers premium sashimi options like uni or Hokkaido scallops for their donburi bowls.  They also sell reasonably priced sashimi and offer takeout trays of maki, sushi and sashimi including uni.   Japan eats is pretty small, with seating for 2 looking out towards Yonge Street. It is intended mainly for takeout. If seating is full, one can eat in food court or at the seating area inside the main retail space beside the HCafe."}
{"text":"For a takeout Sushi/Japanese restaurant this place is excellent! The fish is very fresh, and tastes amazing. They have many options such as grab and go, party trays, and build your own sushi burrito/poke bowl. I have been working in the area for about 3 weeks and have already been 4 times!"}
{"text":"Meh. I ordered a salmon ikura don and was not impressed. It came with five slices of the thinnest salmon sashimi I've ever had. They also skimped out on the pickled ginger and wasabi (literally a pea sized amount). My friend ordered the regular chirashi and also commented on the stingy sashimi portions. Maybe I went on an off day but I'm definitely not giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Got a box of mix sushi for $16.99. The uni and botan ebi sushi were delicious the rest were terrible or mediocre i managed by expectations better.  Maybe next time I will just got uni, ebi, and scallop I would be happier."}
{"text":"The Botan ebi is huge and delicious, the uni is okay, fresh but not really sweet, the ikura is nice as well. The price is okay. Wish there were more seats in the store."}
{"text":"Ordered the poke bowl. It was pretty plain, bland and boring. Salmon serving size was laughable. For $15 you get way better poke around the corner at Poke Eats"}
{"text":"I don't like sushi but I had their uni and scallop it was very tasty!  it would've been better if the tempura shrimp was hot and fresh"}
{"text":"I was eagerly awaiting the opening of this new poke / sushi burrito place and... was left disappointed. It's too bad because they try so hard: - The owners are friendly and accommodating (e.g., they agreed to my request of half-rice, half-salad in my poke bowl) - They offer BOGO (buy 1 get 1 free) poke bowl every 21st of every month  - They are really generous with their servings, with my poke bowl packed with not just a generous helping of sides but even the main protein (I got unagi and was expecting just a small piece but it almost covered the whole bowl) - They have a greater variety of stuff versus other poke places I've been to, trying not only for \"more\" but also for \"more creative\" (especially with the toppings). For example, for protein they offer lobster, king crab and unagi besides the typical stuff. For sides and toppings, they have things like inari tofu, Japan style cream cheese, ube rice,  meat floss, spicy Cheetos flakes. And for sauce, they have lobster bisque, black truffle mayo and apple jelly.  This all sounds awesome, so why was I left wanting? Well, to put it bluntly, the taste was average at best. For example: - I got the unagi poke bowl, which was overly doused in unagi sauce so that I really couldn't taste the unagi itself  - My wife got the tempura shrimp poke bowl and she said her tempura was blandly flavoured and ratio of shrimp-to-coating wasn't good - Cool sides/toppings I talked about earlier didn't live up to expectations, for example: ube rice didn't taste any different, black truffle mayo sauce had no truffle taste, the overly generous helping of rice drowned out the taste of the rest of the sides  So all in all, given the taste was average and on the more expensive side relative to other poke places, I'd give it another shot only during their BOGO promo on the 21st of the month. Otherwise, I'd go to Poke Eats just around the corner for a better poke bowl."}
{"text":"Most delicious Sushi Take Out I've ever had! Ordered Unagi Poke Bowl and the size of Unagi is soooooo large! The rice is amazing and you can only taste it in very high end Japanese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Japanese-fusion heaven.    Was in the area and needed a quick bite. Found this new place through Yelp and was not disappointed.  Upon walking in there is a fridge to the right with some pre-prepared items for those on-the-go, and there is also a huge made-to-order menu. They offer more traditional fare, such as sashimi, nigiri, maki, as well as the latest Japanese-fusion foods - sushi burritos, poke bowls, torched pressed sushi!  They have it all!   With so many options, I had a hard time deciding what to order, but settled on the oysters from the fridge and the Deluxe Chirashi Don from the menu.   This is mainly a take-out joint, with a few seats by the front window.  I was able to snag a seat for myself as someone had just left.  I was so intrigued by the oysters. Two oysters per order each topped with a piece of uni, ikura and apple jelly.  They were so beautiful and tasted as good as they looked!   The oysters were fresh, uni was creamy and the apple jelly added a hint of brightness and sweetness to everything.   The chirashi bowl was presented very nicely, really impressed since this is a take-out joint.  The bowl was red and albacore tuna, salmon, torched salmon, mackerel, scallop, hamachi, uni, cuttlefish, spot prawn on top of a bed of rice.  I'm glad I chose this dish for my first visit so I could judge the quality of the fish. All the sashimi was super fresh and they all had a silky texture. The spot prawn was my favourite! It was so sweet.  Also wanted to mention the bed of rice. I know rice is rice, but this rice had an amazing flavour that complimented the fish so well.   Service is also super friendly.  Will definitely come back to try other items. The torched sushi is next on my list.. maybe I'll have to bring a friend next time, so I can sample more things."}
{"text":"The sushi burrito flavour is not bad but too soggy and the ingredients are not packed tight enough. Too lose that it became too messy. I tried two sushi burritos using white and ube rice and they are both the same.  Their Japanese Eat special roll with scallop and uni is over priced for the taste..."}
{"text":"Just tried this new place at the corner of Yonge and Sheppard and to my amazement it was pretty good!  The wife and I both ordered the Deluxe Chriashi @ $18.99 each serving.  The fish was fresh, uni was great and the service was excellent.  They were so courteous from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out.  It's a small place but they do have a counter to fit a few people to eat on site but most people just get take out.  They also have mini ready- to-go sushi containers varying in sizes for you to grab to accompany your main meal or for a light snack. Although this place is pretty pricey, the freshness is up there.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Lunch break drop by this new store. Best sushi and best sashimi ever! Strongly recommend Deluxe Chirashi and Unagi Poke bowl!"}
{"text":"Was walking around looking for a place to eat by myself.  Since this place only has two seats, it was perfect because I didn't have to do the embarrassing, \"table for one, please. Heh heh\" while shyly keeping my eyes down... Anyways...   I had the Tuna sushi burrito.  Damn it was nice.  The fish was fresh.  The flavor was on point and well-seasoned.  The range of textures from the various ingredients plays nicely with each other and kept each bite interesting.  My only complaint was that I thought my rice was gonna be that nice purple colour like the one on the picture... Woulda been perfect to get them insta likes... Turns out that's ube rice and not in it by default. Place was clean.  Folks were friendly."}
