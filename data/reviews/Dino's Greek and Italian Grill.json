{"text":"Best eggplant parm in the west valley."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and the food was mediocre and overpriced for what it was. All staff was very unfriendly and we had to get up and get our own refills because all of our glasses were empty. There is just no reason to go back."}
{"text":"This is a sad excuse for a Greek restaurant they just salted & peppered the chicken and threw it in pita bread. The service was okay but that's about it."}
{"text":"My son and I loved it! The pizza was authentic Italian, yes I've been to Italy. I had the Tuscany pasta. The sauce was very flavorful and meats were tender. We can't wait to stop by for more."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch here.  I'll be back.  And, it's walking distance to the Brass Armadillo Antique Mall.  I can see many lunch-time visits."}
{"text":"Never write reviews but have to on this place. Food was WAY overpriced for the quality. We waited a long time to receive just  our house salad. When we got our food it was very disgusting , bread was stale and food was cold. I was so disappointed I wasted 60$ on a terrible dinner for my family & I."}
{"text":"We went there for valentines day 2015. We had reservations and they weren't ready when we arrived. After some time they finally got us a table,  outside because they gave someone who arrived after us the last one inside. We waited an excessive amount of time for service after sitting on dirty outdoor furniture. Several other couples were also waiting for long periods of tine. None of the furniture matched and it was very cheap feeling. We ended up leaving after an hour, we only were served drinks. The owners were rude and blunt. Our waiter had to apologize numerous times and was also visibly frustrated. If this was the last restaurant on earth we'd prefer to starve. Fortunately Jersey Mikes is located next door and is superior in every way."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Dino's since before they moved here, so we were glad they moved closer to us. They have great food and the owner and staff are great."}
{"text":"Positive- service prompt, gyro meat in excellent. Neg- calamari horrible. Tasted half cooked with a hint of fish. Lemonade cold with not the typical city water flavor but actual sewer water taste. I didn't believe my Mom... But yes..very accurate description. Not coming back. Had to suck lemons to cleanse the palette"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but have only had the gyros. Can not tell you about other foods but the gyros are the best in the valley. Taste great and each one has enough  meat and veggies to make two. Would have given 5 stars but it is a bit pricey, not to bad I keep going back."}
{"text":"This place is great, the prices are very reasonable. great service and nice atmosphere. The restaurant is clean ,they have an outdoor eating area as well. We've eaten here about five times and it has been great every time. We go for the Greek food , haven't tried the Italian yet. 
Great cocktails too."}
{"text":"Called to get delivery and they said they do not delivery yelp needs to update or this customer need to edit."}
{"text":"We found Dino's by accident and we were very pleasantly surprised!
I'm Greek and my standards of good Greek food are pretty high. 
When we walked in we stood for a minute because no one greeted us until a woman yelled at one of the servers and said \"No one's at the front door to greet people?\" 
After that we were promptly greeted by a lovely young woman who seated us. We quickly had a server come to our table and ask us if we'd like drinks.
We were there for lunch and my non-Greek fiancee ordered a gyro pita with a Greek salad and I ordered the lamb souvlaki pita with Greek salad. They were having a special so it also came with a free drink. It was about 10 or 15 minutes before our food came out, and we were not disappointed. My lamb souvlaki was really good....grilled to medium rare perfection. It was seasoned just right, not too much as to overpower the lamb and not to little so as to not have taste. It was served on a fresh pita with lettuce, tomato and onions. I asked for the tzatziki sauce separately because I'm allergic to dill, but as it turns out, the tzatziki did not have dill in it and it was really good. 
My fiancee really liked his gyro also and we both enjoyed our Greek salads. A basic salad with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers and green pepper (I removed the green peppers), as well as some feta cheese crumbles and two Kalamata olives. The house dressing is similar to Italian dressing but it was not overpowering or too vinegary. Very good and refreshing.
Before our check came our waitress (who was very nice and prompt) gave us a punch card for lunches. If you purchase nine lunches you'll get one free which is a great deal.
The food was very good and after seeing a lot of great Greek favorites on the menu I can't wait to go back and try more.
My fiancee was eager to try some of the Italian specialties as well, so we'll definitely be back.

On the way out, the owner (one of the owners?) Pete stopped us and chatted with us and asked us how we liked the food. He was very kind and friendly. 
I hope this restaurant stays in business for a long time. Great food, very nice owner. 
Stop by and have a meal there, you won't be disappointed. We should support small business owners instead of large chain restaurants, and this is definitely one to support!
Great job Dino's!"}
{"text":"This is the place we stop at when we're driving home from a trip to AZ.  It's DELICIOUS!!!  The portions are huge and the staff is super friendly.  I'll be dreaming of the baba ganoush until I get back there."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews below and I wish I could review the food, since the reviews were good but I was unable to even order any. I stopped by on way home from work to get a \"to-go\" order, walked in..stood there for a long while, no one approached me even tho I made eye contact with 3 people that work there. Finally a gentlemen from behind the bar asked what I needed and I told him a menu so I could order take out, he handed me a menu and when I was ready, I set the menu down and continued to stand there...no one ever re-approached me. I waited 15 minutes and then left, went next door to Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"My husband and I waited for a waiter to take our drink order at least 15 minutes.  When we finally saw a waiter, he went to the next table who were just sat about 2 minutes prior.  When we asked if he could take our order we were told to wait a minute more.
Then we saw something extremely frightening.  The waitress comes out with some plates and lights them up with fire.  It would have been a good show but right underneath these burning plates was a small baby in  high chair at the end of the table.  Any small slip up and this could have ended very badly.
Needless to say we walked out still hungry."}
{"text":"This nice little resturant on Dysart and McDowell on the southwest corner is great. My husband and I took our 3 kids and the server Riley was great,especially with our kids. She was very personable and friendly. The price for all 5 us was to eat was very reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  Always good food and service... Prices are fair.   Try their Pizza and then have some Baklava!"}
{"text":"Went to Dinos was very haapy with the food and the service. Was greeted with a smile from Matt the bartender and the other patrons were also friendly. We ordered Peters special shrimp. It was soooo good! The prawns wrapped in bacon and stuffed wih jalapenos and stuffed with chesse was cooked perfect. The bacon was crisp and the shrimp was not overcooked. I ordered the ceasar salad my husband ordered the greek salad very good all homemade dressings! It is a family owned business the owner Peter checked with us to see how the food was he really cared about what he was serving. I can not wait to return"}
{"text":"Very new and clean. Ok food. Gyro is like $15 (dinner) and at first impression looks huge. Until you realize under the gyro meat is a huge mound of shredded romaine. Never had lettuce served on a gyro. Way overpriced for what this food is. Good greek gyros all over the valley for half the price. Wife had Italian, again ok, but we could have went to oreganos for much better food and paid less. The service was absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Not a lot of Greek Restaurants in my area, so I was delighted to discover this out of the way place. Good food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff. Nice little place."}
{"text":"love the food!! the lemon chicken soup is to die for!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to go all out and ordered the Greek Platter for Two. It begins with the Greek salad, which was simple, but the dressing was thick and tart, just perfect! The platter arrived on an enormous plate! The lamb shank falls off the bone, and it is sweet and succulent, just melting in your mouth.  They supply ample Pita, Tzatziki and shaved gyro meat to create mini-gyros, and it is all supremely delicious.  The hummus was fresh and refreshing, and the greek potatoes were sweet and salty.  This was my first time trying Moussaka, and it was spicy (not hot) and flavorful with savory crust and meat inside.  The rice was average, yet tasty.  I can't honestly speak to the Spanakopita because this version had lemon in it (allergic!), and the same goes with the Dolmathes.  We finished off our Valentine's Day dinner with dessert...chocolate mousse for my hubby, and Baklava for myself.  I've never had Baklava that was sort of spicy, but this had a strange, clove-like taste to it.  I prefer sweeter, so it wasn't my favorite, but someone else might like it quite a bit.  

Now that we've found it, we will definitely eat there again.  The cost was very reasonable, the staff was friendly and fun, our waitress was attentive without being annoying, the music was perfect Greek dance music, and even the owner stopped by to chat with us.  I look forward to going back and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"great good and has great taste. Their italian food and greek stir fry were great and the waitress was awsome. Will recommend"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night for the first time and we will go back again soon. The service was a little slow, but not annoyingly so. We both ordered Greek and it was excellent and plentiful. My wife had the lamb and it was tender and cooked to perfection. I had the moussaka and it was delicious. Because this was our first time there, the owner comped our baklava. Barely had room, but glad I ate it. Next time we'll try the Italian food. If you are looking for a locally-owned, reasonably priced dining experience, then try Dino's. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, but go during lunch if you can it's a lot cheaper. Atmosphere was just ok but the food makes up for it"}
{"text":"It was very good, not the best on the planet but not bad at all. Me and my wife ordered the Greek Feast for Two and it was an insane amount of food. We were both over stuffed and we still took home two full to-go boxes. You get a bit of everything in the feast and it was all wonderful, the only thing I wasn;t a fan of was the spanakopita, it was good but I am just not a fan of cooked down spinach, so its just not a dish for me. They do use a good bit of dill, so if you don't like dill I would beware."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant. We ordered a feta dip that was good but overly salty, however we could see past this. We both ordered Greek Salads, mine tasted pretty good until my boyfriend asked me to taste his. I immediately spit out the salad, somehow BLEACH was in it!!! That's right BLEACH! Or at least this is what it tasted like, but we didn't have a lab to test it in our pocket. I'm pretty sure it was bleach.He had already eaten half of it and it this point did not feel well. There was no way I was eating mine. We talked to the manager who did replace the salad but we were not eating anything they gave us. In my opinion, we should not have had to pay for our meal, instead they charged us for my salad and feta dip. We again talked to the manager, did not ask her to comp our whole meal but expected she would do this out of good business practice, well she did not. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate due to the fact that we were both discussing how the place was quiet and had a romantic atmosphere. My boyfriend has never sent a meal back until this instance."}
{"text":"went there for lunch ordered two gyros which were surpisgnly filling almost didn't have room for my greek salad that I ordered. The gentleman serving us was great! We'd never eaten Greek before so we had many questions and he answered each one with a smile. Will be going back and will be recomending to others."}
{"text":"Our first time here.. I was expecting much! Wow what a pleasant surprise. 

There were 5 of us and we all loved what we ordered.  I had a Greek Pizza and every tasted it and loved it.  MIL had lasagna loved it, hubby had meat Pizza and loved it.  SIL had Gyro and loved it! It was huge.  BIL had  chicken skewer (can't remember the name. He raved about it. 

Waitress was great, the owner came over to see where we were from.. Very pleasant man."}
{"text":"Love Dino's.  I moved here from Ohio and quickly realized why my husband and his family eat at Dino's regularly.  The food is great.  Love the hummus.  Love the spaghetti and meatballs.  LOVE the Lamb wrap on the lunch special.  House salad dressing is die for.  I actually find myself craving it.  People are nice.  Sometimes they are short on lunch waiters, but the owner is very involved and does a great job helping out his staff.  Would HIGHLY recommend Dino's.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"We went to their old location a year ago. And tried the Italian food and kbobs and wasn't impressed. Our friends insisted that we go this weekend. So we gave the new location a try and we are just not a fan."}
{"text":"Discriminatory.  I stood at the podium waiting to be acknowledged for 10 minutes.  Staff and management looked at me standing there, but would not acknowledge my presence.  When I was finally approached (not greeted) by someone who looked like a manager, I asked him if anyone saw me standing there, he said, \"How can I help you?\"  Never will set foot in this place again...took me back to the 60's.  Rudeness, exclusion and discrimination at its best!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made a reservation for Valentine's day-don't bother they weren't organized enough we had a choice of waiting a half hour or sitting on the patio...the patio was uncomfortable and the patio furniture was less than desirable.  It took our waiter forever to acknowledge us-drinks took forever-when or salads came no silverware for us or anybody we noticed-we ended up walking out after waiting for over an hour for the food that never came-which is exceptional sad because we ordered off the PREPARED Valentine's menu! It was the worst dining experience in over twenty years!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros in Arizona. Dolmates are the Bomb. Great service always friendly. Cold beer and warm smiles."}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff! Love this place! Try the lamb, mussels or a gyro. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by the owner with the warmest smile.  The food was just as comforting, served fresh and hot.  Servings were huge.  Get the bruchetta.....yum.  Tyler served us and was fantastic."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Great atmosphere, the owner came to our table the first time we ate there, but not the second. The gyro meat is excellent-so good! The wait staff is very friendly and prompt! The patio is nice to eat at when weather permits!"}
{"text":"Been a fan since the old location.  
I don't write very many reviews. 
If I like a place I go back. 
Started with great food and great service in a clean restaurant. 
Been going back there for over 8 years and have always been treated well, food is consistently on point
Always feel welcome there.  

That's my review."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this place, and the owner was very nice. The gyros were excellent and had plenty of veggies like I like. I'll definitely be coming back here with my wife."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! We went there for the first time and food was horrible. The only thing that was fresh was the tomatoes on my salad. We didn't go there to pay for food that we already have from walmart's freezer or in our pantry! We noticed there was an older man walking around greeting and clearing everyone's table ( perhaps the owner ) not once did he come and ask how our food/service was. I only took a couple bites of my salad and waitress took it back and never bothered to ask if there was a problem with it! My 4 yr old daughter didn't even eat her personal pizza and she loves pizza. We will never go back there again and will not recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"A classy Greek food restaurant with exceptional food and service.  They're gyro lunch is very reasonably priced and is a great gyro.  Dinners are outstanding.   I have never had a bad meal at Dinos.  Dinos is an excellent choice for a date night."}
{"text":"Meat sauce pretty good and we liked the Italian food, but haven't tried the Greek yet."}
{"text":"Love it!  We go here about twice a week for their lunch specials.  They have a great gyro sandwich special for like $5.  I don't get that though as I'm low carb so I get the gyro salad for $8.  SO GOOD!  

I'm only giving it a 4 because I don't know how any of their other food is but their gyro salad is a 5 in my book! :)"}
{"text":"Quiet environment, friendly staff, reasonable prices, good food. My favorite lunch stop."}
{"text":"I made a yelp account for the sole purpose of reviewing this restaurant, I felt the need to warn others not to waste their money. So expensive, and the food is a 2 on a scale to 1 to 10. The rice taste like it's out of the box of Rice-A-Roni, even my infant wouldn't eat it. The potatoes were way overseasoned and after one bite you can't eat any more. The pizza was the worst pizza I've ever tasted, After reading positive reviews, I decided to go try this place out and boy was I disappointed.... The cheese was burnt so they covered it up with more cheese and burnt that too.  The only positive thing I have to say is that the tazitki sauce was tasty...gyro meat was ok. Just okay, A total waste of $20. Smh"}
{"text":"Used to enjoy going to Dino's until they recently changed their menu. The Veal Scallopine has been deleted as has the Seafood Penne (which they will make for you, on request), our favorites. It was indicated that the cost of veal is now prohibitive, although they have added an expensive veal chop to the menu. As a alternative to the scallopine, I tried the Calamari dinner. The calamari was not very good. There was little calamari with much coating and it was overcooked, tasteless other than the oil in which it was deep fried. Could not eat it. The waiter failed to acknowledge when removing the plate, although the hostess earlier offered a doggie box (declined). I have had the gyros platter which is not bad, although for the price, it is a skimpy serving. All in all, it seems the quality and portions have fallen off and the prices increased in order to attempt to survive during these hard economic times.Will drive further to get better."}
{"text":"The food was just ok.  We ordered the Greek platter for 2.  We weren't overwhelmed with the flavors and didn't think it was a very good value at the price.  There were lots of sauces but only 2 pieces of pita and we had to pay for more.

We were also there for happy hour but did not want to sit at the bar for dinner or sit outside in the cold.  We wanted to be comfortable so we sat at a table where I could reach over and pull on a bar chair.  The restaurant was empty except us, but they wouldn't give me a beer for happy hour price because I wasn't sitting in the bar.   Really?  I guess three feet makes all the difference.  Ok I'll just have water.  I don't know why some restaurants have this inane policy.  The restaurant is EMPTY.  I can see the server deflate every time I order water instead."}
{"text":"I love Dino's!! I have been coming here for the past year and always have a wonderful experience. I have tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Dino always takes the time to walk around and greet people. All the food is homemade. Dino will tell you how they are made himself!! The nasty comment about it being like Walmart food is crazy.  And what real foodies would compare it to the yardhouse(gross, processed, overpriced) They obviously  know nothing about food. Prices are a little high but it's because of the the huge portions. They have a $20 appetizer that would feed 4 people for dinner. It's actually my favorite thing on the menu. It's hard for me to read the awful mean comments from people who obviously have no class. Come try Dino's!! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This was literally THE worse eggplant PARM dish Ive ever had.  The breading was practically thicker than the actual slice of eggplant, I kid you not!!   It was sopping with grease and they they threw on a layer of melted cheese on top that made it even worse.  The salad was subpar and looked like it had fresh greens mixed with old greens and blue cheese dressing (normally white in color), had a slightly orange tinge to it like they threw in some weird spice or something.  The red sauce was just red sauce - no flavor.  About the only thing I can give them credit for is that the spaghetti was prepared al dente.  Told the waitress and returned entree.  The manager (owner) was walking around chatting it up with folks but never came around to our table to ask about our meal even after the entree was returned and waitress brought it to their attention.  They only offered free dessert but I kindly refused.  They did end up removing $7.50 of the $15 price of my entree.  Something better than nothing.  But I won't be returning to this place and I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Change the gyro meat to real steak meat I ll give u 5 star but that gyro is not ok comparing your other food"}
{"text":"The male server that we have is not friendly at all.  I am out to dinner with my son, and I asked for straws the server came back with two straws unwrapped and jammed them into our drinks.  Not happy when he did that,  I don't know if I should take a drink or not. Right now no tip for him.
Haven't seen our waiter since we received our food I guess no refills on drinks for us.  I would like to get our bill so that we can get out of here.  This is the first time that I did not tip a server. Maybe if he would have given us a little bit more attention he may have received a tip."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. I was a little unsure because of its strip mall locale but I will definitely be coming back.  The food was good, reasonably priced and way more than I could eat. Great service too."}
{"text":"Thank you to the team today for great service from our waiter Tyler, to the cooks who made one of the best meals we all have had in a long time and last but not least Mr. Peter, the owner, who stopped by the table and helped with food suggestions. Overall the meal for the 3 of us was very enjoyable. I will be back to have the spanakopita as a meal as it was great as the appetizer with the calamari. The homemade mariana & more importantly the tzatziki was so good just had to take it home. My parents enjoyed the Greek stir fry and lamb chops. I took pictures of the food but alas I forgot 2 take picture of dad's plate clean, no leftovers for him. We were so filled no desserts tonight that is 4 next time as we will be back that is 100% for sure."}
{"text":"Great meal! We stopped here on a whim as we drove by and were pleasantly surprised. Our night began as an adventure across the phoenix metro area to Pei Wei to get one of their amazingly scrumptious looking lettuce wraps. When we arrived they informed us they were out of the pork and my boyfriend was so disappointed he insisted we leave and go somewhere else. Our date night was clearly off to a good start. 

As we drove away crushed we noticed a sign for Greek and Italian food and decided to give it a try. 

First thing I ordered was a pomegranate margarita - one was enough to get me buzzed! :) 

The hummus was amazing, pita was fresh and delicious. I ordered the salmon which was perfectly cooked! It came with the tomato basil soul which was drool worthy! 
My date ordered the gyro plate and it was so good he forgot all about the Pei Wei fiasco. 

The portions were large for the amount we paid (12 to 15 dollars for an entree and 5 dollars for a hummus appetizer) and we would have gladly paid more for what we received. 

Overall we were impressed and will definitely come back to Dino's!"}
{"text":"Having married into a Greek family and eating Greek food for the last 35 years I can tell you this place is spot on. Great service, good food, I  highly recommend Dino's"}
{"text":"Best gyro I've had. They should put one in Scottsdale so I wouldn't have to drive so far."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get Greek gyros. My boyfriend and I come very often and have never been disappointed. My boyfriend always gets the fries, and I always get the Greek salad. The fries have a little bit of season salt, and the salad dressing is very good, not too over powering like some can be. Yelp says they open at 10, but our server told us today that they open at 11. They still were happy to accommodate us early. This is a place we love bringing family and friends from out of town as well, and everyone is always pleased"}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the pita bread. It is warm, soft, and fresh. The hummus is way too garlic-y and the fried zucchini tasted like it was previously frozen. They have several vegetarian options. I had the Greek salad which was huge. The house dressing is good. There were way too many onions and not enough tomatoes for my taste. We skipped dessert since it looked like everything they had was in one of those rotating refrigerators you'd find in a cafeteria. 

It was a far drive but we were meeting friends who live in the west side. Unless we are out there again, we won't be back. If we are out there again, I think I would rather stick to Streets of New York."}
{"text":"Cheap food from a box,  nothing fresh or from scratch.  Racist trash frequent the bar,  watching fox news while spewing political ignorance,  social intolerance and racial epithets."}
{"text":"Great, cozy Greek restaurant. Stumbled upon it near our hotel, checked it on Yelp, and here we are. Started with Zucchini cakes, dipped them in Skordalia( nice garlic flavor) and Tirokefteri (feta sauce with a hint of spice -yum) main event was Lamb chops with Greek potatoes, fresh vegetables....awesome.  As good as Mykonos in Niles, IL OR Molyvos in NYC!  We are totally satiated and the taste buds Are singing!!!!  Service was excellent ... thank you Cathy!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner on a Friday night a few weeks ago. The restaurant was maybe 1/4 full the whole time we were there. We shared some \"Greek fries\" to start and then shared a pizza. I also got a side salad and my husband had a bowl of soup. Nothing we ordered was very good. Service was average. We like to try different places in our area but this is one place we will not be returning to."}
{"text":"Love their calzones & gyros! And the spanakopita is unbeatable! We also like picking up the appetizer platter for any pot luck we go to. It's a lot of good food with a small price"}
{"text":"Jesse and I went there last night on whim after driving around aimlessly looking for a new place to try. It wasn't busy at 8:30pm but there were a few people at the bar and a large party enjoying themselves nearby. Our server was nice and quick when it came to serving. The menu is HUGE! I got the Mamouska and Jesse ordered the Greek Stirfry. Both were big portions and equally delicious. You can tell that there are some great people in the kitchen. The pita bread was soft and warm and overall we had a great time."}
{"text":"Greeks come have some home cooking!  This place is great!  Small family run greek restaurant is always packed with people.  It goes to show how location for a restaurant is important but if the food is good they will come.  This place is nestled in a small retail center in the West valley.  We accidentally ran into it and boy did we find a home away from home. 

Great drinks, Authentic greek beers!

The Saganaki (flaming greek cheese appetizer) is awesome they will light that plate and turn everyone's head as they yell OPA!      

They have a great greek salad that goes well with most dishes.  The gyro's are great the meat is cooked perfectly! Pita's are pita's but they never disappoint.  

The Lamb is a great dish although better be ready for portions because Peter (owner) is not a selfish man he makes sure you are getting fed.  

For deserts the bacleva is a must!  

Stop by and have a great dinner!"}
{"text":"You will get an excellent meal.  Family owned:  no chain here.  The made from scratch soups are outstanding.  There is something for everyone.  Try the Lamp Chops, they are the best.  Peter's special prawns are also good (bacon wrapped cheezy shrimp).  Portions are large enough to have some left to take home."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with this place considering so many folks I knew gave it two thumbs up.  Maybe because of all the hype, I was expecting too much.  Both the hubby and I had the gyro and shared the cheese bread appetizer.  

Let me just say the cheese bread appetizer deserved 5 stars.  It was awesome.  Our favorite gyro place closed down called Ararat's and I'm comparing Dino's to Arararats and Dino's doesn't even come close.  We also liked Ararat's rice more so than Dino's but Dino's potatoes were pretty good.

The service was good so they definitely deserve kudos for that and it is nice to have a greek restauarant to go to close to home so we'll definitely go there again.  We'll probably try something different next time."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken and lamb sowlaki (skewers).   Both were great, came with lemon potatoes, rice and veggies with soup or salad.   Veggies could have been cooked longer, kinda hard but next time I will ask to cook longer.    My wife tried the bolognese and added meatballs and she really enjoyed it.   Went back again later in the week and tried the Gyro's........excellent.   Desserts are pretty good too.    Will be back again for sure........highly recommend.    Service was very good too."}
{"text":"I love that this is a small mom and pop place. The owner is always so nice, he comes to our table and asks how we are enjoying our food. The HAPPY HOUR drinks are a great deal, and the food is delicious... I highly recommend the DOLMADES... they are creamy and oh so tasty!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here for dinner!  
We ordered the flaming cheese (that's not the name for it on the menu).  They squirt lemon on it to put the fire out, so the cheese is very lemony.  Good, but I'd prefer less of a lemon taste. 
We ordered the giant platter to share & well worth it.  I'm not a lamb fan, so I didn't try the shank.  Hubby did & said it was good.  Everything on the platter was great!!  Especially loved the hummus and spanokapita.  I recommend. Service was great and atmosphere was nice too."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch at about 2:30 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. I was the only person there. I was seated quickly and ordered a calamari appetizer and a small Greek pizza. I substituted the ground beef that comes on pizza for giro meet. I waited for about twenty minutes and had three glasses of ice tea before the waiter checked on my appetizer. I chief forgot or didn't make the calamari yet. So about seven minutes later the calamari came out. It was soggy and tasted like it was fried in burnt oil. The pizza came out shortly after. The crust on the pizza was hands down the worst I have ever had. It tasted like an opened frozen pizza crust that had sat in the freezer for to long. 
$7.95 for the Calamari
$12.95 for the Pizza
$2.95 for ice tea.
With tax it was over $25.00 dollars for food I would not feed to my dog.
Do yourself a favor and stay away."}
{"text":"Took the whole family for a late dinner. Greeted at the door by the owner, waiter was awesome, and they had delicious lamb. Rest of the family had Italian and it was up to par. Definitely recommend and worth a try. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Big bummer.  Tried the stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer and aside from lemon sauce there was absolutely ZERO taste.  Not a dash if salt or seasoning.    We tried spaghetti and meat balls.  Would bet my mortgage the meatballs were frozen.  Food semed not the freshest and mostly packaged.  If you're going to have a restaurant, Make your food, not frozen, boxed crap people can make at home.  We tried the chicken and shrimp pasta.  Chicken was okay but shrimp was rubbery and was actually happy there were only 2 in there.  Lighting is horrible inside.  Waitress nice and attentive but too many other options in area to return."}
{"text":"I saw the Yelp reviews and decided to try Dino's Greek and Italian Grill. The real driver for me was seeing that they had stuffed grape leaves, stuffed with meat. Most everywhere else I've tried only has the vegetarian version.

My family made stuffed grape leaves when I was growing up, and it's one of my favorite dishes. We called it yabra, the Greeks call it dolma or variations of that word. The recipe I grew up eating has beef, lamb, rice and tomato sauce as the primary ingredients of the filling, wrapped in a grape leaf. Dino's version has beef and rice, and some sort of lemon juice or something. 

It was very good, and I'll go back for it again. I don't think it's nearly as good as the version with tomato sauce, but it's still better than any others I've found in a long time.

I also had a lamb gyro. The meat was nicely cooked, and the portion size is about the same as most gyro's. The meat was in rather large chunks for a sandwich, and I ended up using a knife and fork to cut it into smaller pieces. The flavor was excellent.

Service was excellent.  The same person seated me and was my server. There was only a small lunch crowd, maybe 4 or 5 tables. She was attentive without being a pest, courteous, and got everything right. 

I'll be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"First time here, the food was great! The Fettuccini Carbona was out of this world. It's clean warm atmosphere is very  welcoming and friendly. Definitely coming back for happy hour"}
{"text":"I love this place the gyros are great, and only $5.99 with a drink . The place has an up scale feel. Great sevice and good food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner here. I don't know why this place has such a low rating. Unfortunately, I did not snap any photos, as I was starving and dug in right away. 

We went to this restaurant around 7PM on a Friday night. The place was busy, but we were able to secure a table right away. The ambiance was a little off-as It did feel more like a bar than a Greek/Italian restaurant with the neon signs on the windows. As for the food:

Dolmathes appetizer: Amazing. This is the first time I have tried this, and I am a fan. They tasted great. There was 6 to an order, and were served promptly. 

Main course: 
I had the Prime Rib special (rare of couse). It came with greek veggies and mashed potatoes and a side salad. I upgraded to the greek salad for $2. The portion was huge. The cut was at least 1\" thick. This thing had to weigh about 20 oz. It was cooked to perfection (for me). It had a very tasty bark on the outside. I was only able to eat about half (leftover's yaay!). 

The wife had the Carbonara. She opted for clam chowder vice the salad. I tried both. The chowder was good (I'm not really a clam chowder fan), and the carbonara was very good. I'm confident that I will order that in our subsequent trips to this restaurant. 

Despite it being busy, the service was prompt, and the food came out quick. I definitely recommend this place to anyone craving Italian or Greek. 

All-in-all, the food and the service here is excellent. I would rate it 5/5. The only real turn-off for me, was the ambiance. Once again, it did feel/look more like a bar than a restaurant. With that said, I give the ambiance a 4/5. This place is certainly a diamond in the rough for the Goodyear area."}
{"text":"We brought my family there to celebrate our sons graduation. We wanted to try a family restaurant instead of a chain. Food was good, server was excellent and quickly resolved an issue. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very Good Greek food with a nice family atmosphere.  I get a sense this place is family owned by the hospitality and time they take to explain the menu.  Diner like atmosphere, outdoor seating and very clean.  
This very well may be the best restaurant (not just Greek) in Goodyear."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the happy hour. Let me point out we went not to drink and so I can't say if its good for that. But let me get to the food. We had the sliders which seemed to be made from frozen Costco meat and inedible. The Greek fries also Costco with a little feta and garlic thrown on. Anybody can make this. The calamari also seemed like frozen no taste. The falafel we ordered tasted terrible and I know what good falafel taste like. The dolmas tasted like dog food need I say more not sure how they stay in business maybe the bar is good, the food is awful. Service seemed fine and looked like a nice clean place but we will definitely not be back. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for lunch. I try to come weekly. I've been coming to Dino's for years. Even when they used to be located on wigwam & Indian school. They're portions are large and the pricing is decent. The only downside is you can tell when a different chef is on staff. The food always tastes great, but sometimes the presentation is off."}
{"text":"Very happy with the food and service here! Got the chicken souvlaki and it was delicious! The pita bread was so fresh and the chicken was very moist. The French fries were also amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband, 2 kids, and I love this place. My husband always orders Roasted Lamb and a pitcher of beer. Kids love the Lentil soup and me, well I've just about ordered everything on the menu. Love it all, especially the Roasted Lamb!"}
{"text":"Thank you, K C N, for the clarification on the city location. So, me and the wife visited the new location and it is fabulous! Same menu, most of the same staff, and as before, great food and service! If you like Greek food this is the best you will find on the west side, IMHO."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, the gyros and pitas are great, and the restaurant is family owned. I really recommend the classic gyro or chicken pita.

Some of the ingredients are apparently hand picked, and the food definitely shows that.  Their dessert is quite tasty, and I'm not usually a dessert person."}
{"text":"My salmon was perfection. The vegetables and rice were divine. Our service was good and we didn't have to wait too long for dinner on a weeknight. We will definitely go here as regulars."}
{"text":"Popped into Dino's because they had a sign for happy hour from 2-7 so I thought I'd give them a try. Not the best happy hour prices but food was ok. Got grilled prawns in garlic butter which I thought would have some flavor but it was kinda bland. Not awful just needed some seasoning. And I got a gyro with Greek salad which was pretty good and I enjoyed it. I like that they give you the tzatziki sauce on the side."}
{"text":"We spent $46.08 on a calamari entree, a lamb shanks entree, and a glass of red wine. We got plenty of food that was fresh and tasty. The calamari was tender. I liked its saltiness, but some people might have found that overwhelming. You'll feel like in you're New Jersey or on the Island (as in Long) again."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of our favorites........ date night special.   Low lights, quiet so we can talk and not yell.  Always hot, delicious foods Greek or Italian....definitely not your cookie cutter restaurant.  And Dino com s and visits his customers at the table, truly a nice relaxing evening with charming and polite staff - don't forget dessert limoncello is a wonderful way to top off a spectacular meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I would say that this place is one of our favorites but after tonight we will never go back !! We have never felt so disrespected anywhere and had a horrible experience. I'm truly saddened from this :("}
{"text":"Usually have the gyro meal. It is ok. Price is good. Haven't tried anything else. The place was usually empty when we went which was nice with kids, but this was at the Indian school location. Not my favorite Greek place on the west valley but it will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Dino's regularly for dinner for many years and we're never disappointed. Their pizzas are great as are their baked pastas. This is a family owned restaurant at it's finest. The staff is always friendly and it's obvious the owners take great pride in their food and service. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place many times. Pete the owner knows his greek food. Coming from a greek . This food is good! Also the dinner portions are huge!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my friend and had a $5.99 gyro and she had the spicy feta. Although the pita was good the rest not to much. I ordered a side of fries that were an extra $1.99 and we weren't too impressed. Our server was yelling to other co workers and didn't come back to give us our check. The other server was bring out food constantly to her tables and refilling drinks while our server was talking to the customers and co workers. I honestly don't think my friend and I will come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Dino's yesterday. It was not too crowded for a Thursday afternoon. Nice menu with many options. I chose the Greek Salad.  Once ordered, the food arrived in just a few minutes. My salad was large in size with goodly amounts of feta cheese, olives and other ingredients, including some pita on the side, dressing was also on the side. Very good salad. I usually finish all the food in front of me (must be something from my childhood), but I did leave a few fork fulls as I just could not eat another bite. Dino's has many specials everyday and others specials for just about each day of the week. The prices are very reasonable and the food is very good, which equates to real value for your food dollars. Seems like Dino's has a nice following and I can see why. I will go there again and sample some of the specials."}
{"text":"I absolutly love this place.  It's family owned.  The owners are there everytime i have come in for lunch or dinner.  They really care about their customers and the quality of the food!!  I even see the owner jump into the kitchen and actually start cooking himself!!!   This place has a cute little patio where i can enjoy the weather, the sunset over the mountains and have some drinks with my friends.   what else could you ask for.  you say great service; well there is no doubt that Dino's has this as well.  An all around great place.  if you have never been here, stop by... you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Come Hungry

Dino's Greek and Italian Grill is located in one of the ubiquitous strip malls in the area. The restaurant is family friendly and offers a large menu with a cobination of Greek and Italian specialties including pizzas, there is something to satisfy just about everyones craving.  In addition, to a varied menu, Dino's offers a nice selection of wines and a bar that will create whatever you wish.  

I  am still exploring the menu and have not had a less-than-great meal and once you meet the owners, you know you are in for the real deal. The food is authentic, delicious, and the portions are large, so be prepared to carry out some leftovers. 

The Service is good, the staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the lunch specials are a great deal.

{"text":"I love Greek food and judge greek restaurants on three basic things.. the gyro meat, the tzatziki, and the rice- chicken soup (the name escaped me right now).
I had the \"Gyro dinner\" which came with the gyro, greek potatoes, rice, some veggies and mixed green salad or a coup of soup. It was A LOT of food. After the rice-chicken soup, I only managed to eat half of the gyro and a little of the rest. The gyro was heavy on the meat - I like mine with evenly balanced meat, lettuce,tomato and onion. The soup was good, salty, but not as broth-y as I like it. The meat was on point and wonderful with the delicious tzatziki (always ask for extra). Sides: the veggies were zucchini, carrots, and broccoli were good. The greek potatoes were good too although I'm not sure what made them Greek. The rice was the least exciting part of the dinner... it was a filler.
I like that the restaurant has both italian and greek food. Atmosphere of the place is ok and the staff is very nice and helpful. I'd recommend eating here and will be back"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 3.5.

First off I AM a fan. I love the food and love the nice, quiet ambiance of Dino's. It is clean and the food is really fresh and tasty.  I will keep coming back.

However I had to give lower marks because, aside from the first time we came here, we have had bad service. We waited very long to get a waiter to our table the 2nd and 3rd time I've came. On the 3rd time eating here, on top of taking forever to put our order in and waiting another 20 minutes for our food, the waitress (as she is bringing my friend's food out) tells me that they are out of the meat in my order. I'm a pretty easy going person, but really? You couldn't have informed me 20 minutes ago?? Luckily I was full off of the salad and pita bread I had started eating so I just canceled my order.

Bottom line, this place is worth visiting, but I hope the owners of Dino's read this. They need to work on their waiting staff, not everybody will be as forgiving as me and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Food is very good, and portions are large.  Staff is wonderful! The baked manicotti, pizza and the steamed clams are all awesome."}
{"text":"stopped in after seeing this on check please Arizona.  I tried a pizza and my husband tried pasta with sausage and peppers.  we were very disappointed.  the pizza lacked flavor and the pasta was soupy.  the marinara sauce was thin.  The service was slow and the overall experience was not great.  I would recommend many other options for Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mediterranean food on this side of town. The meat is fresh, not overly seasoned and cooked to perfection. They have a wonderful location and ambience to the Restsurant. I'm always greeted when I walk in with a smile. The aroma takes over and clears all stressors of the day. My mind and body are ready for satisfaction. Prices are outstanding for the quality and quantity of food. My digestive system is a little sensitive and their food has never given me an upset stomach like most other restaurants alike. This, to me, is the knowing that I'll be returning. I'm here right now and just met the main manager/owner. A very friendly man who truly listened to my compliments. Thank you Dina's. I'm very happy and will talk about the fine quality with every peer and client I know."}
{"text":"WeI did see this AMAZING RESTAURANT on Saturday morning with high ratings.  I went tonight with my family n was just outstanding from the time we walked in.  Food, service n hospitality.  I can't wait to go again.  Thx for everything"}
{"text":"A slightly below average experience.

The server seemed like he was either having a bad day, bored with his job, or not thrilled that we came in for their $5.99 gyro and a drink lunch special. Not sure which it was, but we sure didn't feel welcomed or wanted there.

The gyro itself was okay. I love Mediterranean, as you can see from my previous reviews, and this was about as average as they come. At this point we have no intentions of returning."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a marvelous evening with a large group of club members,
for dinner this evening. The food was delicious. Peter and his staff
were friendly and welcoming . Great atmosphere. Will definitely be
back !

{"text":"We are looking for a good Greek restaurant in Phoenix and came across Dinos by accident. Any Greek restaurant has stiff competition with a Greek Grandmother and a recent trip to Greece. Dinos came up close.  The Spanikopita, and Dolmathes were decent. Pitas were fresh and awesome. Gyro meat and Greek stir fry were best we've had in the region. Baklava was yummy and only missing Grandmas love. Staff was attentive and friendly too"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and have always been satisfied with good food. I highly recommend their baked dishes, like the spaghetti. This time I tried the meatball sub for lunch and it was very good. My father had the lasagna and he also enjoyed his. Only disappoint was the garlic bread that burnt and flavorless. Actually that's the first time I have had something from here that I did not like. All in all, the food is on point. The atmosphere is fine. Could they spruce it up a little, yes....but all in all it is fine. The staff has always been great but today are waitress seemed a little blah. She did all the things she should do but her mood was just off. None the less, I am a fan, and will come again. Get the baked dishes!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not very good at all. So many places that offer better italian cuisine. Go her if you want your lasagna served to you in a soup bowl , and if you want your greek salad to be full of lettuce"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for a while and after having read the reviews, I knew I had to.  

My best friend and I stopped by on a Sunday evening.  The place wasn't busy and there were plenty of servers available.  Which made me wonder why it took so long for us to have our drink orders taken (just an Iced tea and water).  This was only the beginning of the issue with the service...

They have a fairly large menu with a great selection of both Greek and Italian cuisines.  We started with the hummus and pita as an appetizer.  It was very good and you could tell the hummus was freshly made.  

My friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the Spaghetti Oglio with feta (I asked if they could add some artichoke hearts and they did with no extra charge).  My dish was very good.  The servings are perfect if you want leftovers for the next day.  My bestie also said that her meal was great and also had plenty for leftovers!  

Now to the only qualms we had with the place.  Once we got our meal, our server only came by once to refill my iced tea.  Other than that...she was pretty much invisible.  The other 3 servers were constantly visible around the restaurant.  One guy even had a table of 10 that he was checking on periodically.  Finally, when we were ready for our check we had to ask another server to inform ours that we were ready for our check.  Again, the place wasn't that busy and we literally sat there waiting for our check for a good 10-15 minutes before we finally had to ask for our server.  

I would have given this review 4 or 5 stars, but I feel I had to scale it down due to the service (which really only refers to our own server since the others seemed to be pretty much on the ball).  She was friendly...I will not take that away from her.  However, she could use a brush up on some customer service skills.  

We will be going back and would definitely recommend it to others, with hopes that the service is better.  

I do look forward to trying the gyro as it looked delicious! 

P.S.  Whatever Italian dressing they use for the salad is perfect!"}
{"text":"Great food regardless of whether you choose Greek or Italian! Very satisfied with the Greek style stir fry and the Meat Lovers pizza. Kristen took great care of us and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time visitor.....,Came to Dino's with my father and husband. Place was packed but we waited. I'm so glad we did. Food was worth the wait. Had bruschetta for appetizer that was delicious.  Then for our dinners we tried pastas and steaks. All was good. Glad we came here.  Service was also excellent!!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. My wife and I wanted somewhere Italian and this place wasn't far from our place. We sat in the bar and had happy hour and dinner. Martinis were really good and we ordered the calamari for our appetizer. It was really good and the portions were good size.

I ordered the chicken carbonara and it was amazing! I highly recommend it. My wife had the meat ravioli and she loved it as well. Food took some time to come out but it was busy however the food was fresh and hot so no complaints here! Also had their lemon chicken soup and it was great, again the portion was big for a cup of soup. Bring your appetite, you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I've actually been here a few times and am finally getting around to reviewing this restaurant. This last visit, I got a greek salad with gyro meat and a side of tzadziki. I also tried my dining partner's hummus. Everything was perfect! The server was friendly and delightful. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour info is misleading. Husband and I ordered 2 beers (from the happy hr menu posted at the bar...as you walk in) and an appetizer, as well as a meal. When I got the bill, APPARENTLY in order to get \"happy hr\" prices you HAVE to sit in the bar, or on the patio. What?!? Really deceiving. And our server never informed us. Food was good. Large portions. Service was ok. Clean place. Not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"Décor awful.  Atmosphere cheap.  Service slow. Food mediocre."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek Food.   They have the best gyro pita sandwich in town."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 5 people this time, so hoping the experience was better.  The food was good for me but on the pricey side for the amount of food I got.  I got the baked pasta (Alfredo with chicken) and a piece of un-toasted bread.  Two people from our group wanted the gyro meat well-well done.  They said they could do it.  When the gyro dinner plates came out, they looked like they were shaved off and served.  We return 1 of the plates to make sure the meat was well done.  It came back barely touching any heat.  So the person in our group didn't eat all at.  =(  The service was friendly but lacking.  Not sure if the server was not doing her job or was new at it?"}
{"text":"We stopped in a few nights ago with a taste for some Greek food, looking for something new with a sit down atmosphere.

The Atmospere isn't anything special, typical, stripmall restaurant, however the service was friendly and attentive and kept my iced tea topped off.

I ordered the gyro plate, it came with fingerling potatos, pilaf style rice, and fresh veggies, oh and I almost forgot the mountain of Gyro meat on a huge pita with plenty of tzatziki. it even came with soup or salad.

The food was good, the vegetables were fresh,  the gyro was more than filling. and reasonably priced.

I didn't order desert but my mother in law who was with us did, normally she guilts me to help finish her desserts, but I said not this time, she guilted me into a bite though which was a very tasty bite though.

it's not in our immediately neighborhood, but I would come back."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Sunday evening. The food is excellent my husband and weI shared the lamb shank it was delicious. This is the second time we've been here, once for lunch once for dinner. The lunch staff are excellent. Unfortunately our waitress was somewhat new, we had guests with us and she made multiple mistakes. The dinner is a little on the pricey side therefore my expectation is that the service be in line with the price. Correcting issues after the fact makes for less enjoyable experience. For example we explained that we were splitting the plate the dinner arrived on one plate with no extra plates to split the food onto when we requested a plate, the plate arrived it was cold. ( the waitstaff should inform guest splits cannot be done in kitchen, just sayin) Little incidents like this create a less enjoyable dining experience. We ordered appetizers; dolmathes are excellent! & Calamari which was pretty good. Our friends both ordered lamb souvlaki which were delicious. All meals come with soup or salad and both excellent. We finished with Tiramisu, it is the best I've ever had and it's made right on the premises. My rating is based on the overall dining experience although the food is excellent I was very disappointed with the service considering there were not that many tables occupied."}
{"text":"Came with the wife for Valentine's dinner.
We started with calamari. It came hot and very fresh. I think the oil they cooked it in was not very hot as it was very oily.  
We both ordered the special;  new york strip and lobster.  
The house salad dressing is very good.
The dinner arrived. My plate was swiming in a clear liquid but my wife's was not. This had the effect of turning my mashed potatoes into a mash. The steak was under seasoned and the lobster was perfect.
The desert was cheese cake with raspberry sauce. Wow was that good!

The staff is very friendly and service is fast. 
Will give them another try for the greek food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were staying in Goodyear for work and there were not a ton of non-chain/non-fast food dinner options to choose from. We can across this place and decided to give it a try despite the strip mall location since they appeared to have a good, diverse menu.

I have to say...the meal was GREAT. It really, truly was. We got the bruschetta as our appetizer and it was huge, delicious and fresh. I then got the Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken for dinner and my boyfriend got the the cheese tortellini with meat sauce. Both again were very tasty and enormous portion sizes. The wait staff was also friendly and attentive.

If you're in the area, give this place a try. It's definitely a big step up from the other local dining options."}
{"text":"My favorite place on this side of town! Look for it to be on check please az soon! It's me doing the review we taped in October! The other 2 people on show loves it also! Get the prime rib on Friday nights!!!!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and decided to go eat at Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen in Goodyear this past weekend. Unfortunately it has closed due to the economy. We have eaten at the Surprise location several times and loved it. We noticed Dino's across the way from Picazzo's and decided to try them out. It was nothing special. Drinks were the only thing that was good..... We will not go there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Although I feel bad for having to say it, because the owner is really nice, this place is pretty underwhelming.  

The decor is nice, albeit a bit generic, but the service, food and drinks are less than mediocre.  Starting with service: admittedly the place has only been open a couple months, but the waitress (really young girl) seemed to be more concerned with checking out the busboy than serving.  Had to ask for a water 3 times when she kept returning to the table without it, she told us one of the sauces was a vegetarian brown sauce--but when we asked the owner (who brought out the food) she said it was a red sauce with meat.  The drinks at the bar were REALLY weak, but priced pretty decently and the food was pretty good.  Based solely on food, they probably would have gotten 3.5 stars, but service and drinks brought it down to 2.  The chicken marsala was good, but skip the spaghetti that comes with it, try for a different side because the sauce tasted really old.  Word on the street is the Greek side of the menu is much better than the Italian, unfortunately I went with the latter.

Perhaps, as with most new restaurants, with time and fine tuning things will get better.  Let's hope so."}
{"text":"Went back with some friends to have lunch...had the gyro special for $5.95 (included fries). This was  delicious....service was good this time, but my friends knew most of the employees."}
{"text":"Had Gyros dinner nice sized portion soup and salad were great. Food could be hotter, good value for the money. Service and ambience nice."}
{"text":"Had Gyros pita and Greek fries. The Gyros was good but the Greek fries were just fries with gets, no sauce, and the fries were hard and cold. 

The marinara is not like any marinara I've ever had, and wouldn't order it again. 
Bread was dry.

We won't be returning. So boring we didn't even finish it. Spent $30 plus tip and we are going home to eat leftovers."}

{"text":"I've brought my family from out of town here and it never failed to impress. The overall layout is very eye catching once inside and the staff is always attentive and friendly. I've ordered everything from the calzones, to the pasta, to the gyros and all have tasted amazing. Also had a sangria and it was made just the way I like it (not too sweet)."}
{"text":"We went to Dino's for dinner on Friday night and were very pleased with the service we received. Our food was excellent! We enjoyed falafel, garlic prawns, pizza and baked spaghetti. My husband and I really appreciate the owners presence in his restaurant. The owner, Peter, was very sweet to our daughter. We love supporting local restaurants and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is over rated. I had fettuccine alfredo and jar sauce would have been better. I ordered a cannoli and the middle was hallow, filling only on both ends and none in the middle. Wouldn't reccomend this place."}
{"text":"I almost laughed when I looked at the prices on the menu. They have Yardhouse prices for Walmart deli looking food (not trying to be mean). The salad was warm & wilted and when I ordered a glass of wine, there were these small jelly looking balls in it, not quite sure what it was, but I didn't want to risk drinking it. I lost my appetite before dinner."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Cloth napkins, cute decorations and wonderful service was only topped by the food! Gyro was awesome and the tzatsiki sauce was best ive had outside of my own kitchen! Lamb had great flavor and just the right amount of cook on it. Greek salad was great with wonderful feta! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun friendly place great bartender good food! Sydney loves the grape leaves!  
They are home made and wonderful. 

clam chowder? In a Greek- Italian restaurant?? Yes. I'm from New England and we make the best chowders in the world and I was hesitant so the barkeep Kristen said it was worth trying. She was right. It was good. Creamy and rich. 

My steak was a very nice 10oz strip. The Greek potatoes were excellent and veggies were too.  Plenty of food for the price. Sydney had the salmon salad and she said it was really good! 

Service is above most in the area and is done by committee. Everyone is involved and welcoming."}
{"text":"The good:  Great bartender and great service.  Cute place.  Ok food--but not great food for Greek-Italian.
The bad:  Ironically, I am Greek and Italian, so have some expertise at this one.  The lasagna...really?  It is a bowl full of lasagna noodles, soggy with tons of cheese melted and some relatively bland marinara.  The avgolemono soup is basically chicken and rice with a filler added to stretch it.  Not much lemon flavor in it either.  I've had better...hell, I've made better.  And the tiramisu--which is made there--was great but where was the liquor flavor that tiramisu is supposed to be soaked in?

All in all, I probably would never go back--unless it was for some fantastic appetizers at really good prices we had there first.  Now that's why you go to this place:  the appetizers and the bar = excellent.

The dinner food rates a \"meh\" from me.  Sorry...but I'll give it a 4 star cause the bartender was so great and the appetizers were wonderful looking."}
{"text":"Erick was an amazing waiter (: he was so helpful in suggesting food.  It was our first time here and we really enjoyed the place.  
My husband and I wanted to try something new and we where so happy we picked this place. 
PRIME RIB WITH MEAT JUICE SAUCE THE BEST"}
{"text":"It was average food, very salty, and the staff were friendly but service was terrible. Had to wait forever for food - there were only two tables with people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"What can I say about this plave, other than it is always on my short list of where to go for lunch or dinner. The staff is great, the owners are 8ncredible, and the food is amazing. When in doubt, go to Dino's!"}
{"text":"It is not often you find a staff who puts themselves into the food with care. The depth of flavor in the chicken, lamb and beef was rich, complex and fresh. The veggies were crisp and danced on the palette after absorbing the stir fry broth. The pita bread was soft and would garner approval from any Greek grandmother.

Each day the owners go out and gather fresh ingredients for the day and it shows in the food. Service was friendly and you could tell she loved working at Dino's. When asked she shared her recommendations with enthusiasm and genuineness.

As a fan of Greek food I can say Dino's is a true taste of Greece. We tasted the Dolmathes (grape leaves stuffed with rice and sausage). If authentic Greek is too scary the flat bread zucchini will thrill your taste buds as well. For dessert the baklava's phyllo dough crunches loudly as you cut into it, was balanced with just the right sweetness and nuttiness.

The lunch menu is affordable and filled with great options including the souvlaki pita and the gyro pita. From the dinner menu we tried the Greek stir fry. 

Consensus: Great Greek food can be found at Dino's."}
{"text":"Dined here again this week and again, I am feeling it's nothing special.  Was able to sit out on the patio again which I just love!  But we came for Happy Hour which isn't really the best deal.  Their house wine is .30 off a glass and is NOT good.   Their Greek food is better than the Italian but there are a lot of Greek places in the area that are less expensive.  I think I'm going to have to pass on coming here again for dinner.  I wouldn't rule it out for lunch when the prices are a little lower.  Waitresses were nice but seem incredibly bored!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and portion sizes were great. Left dinner satisfied and full. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here for this first time this last week. I've heard it's great but I didn't think too much of it. It was decent yet over priced. I can make the food at home if not better. Maybe that's why. Save your money and go to oreganos!"}
{"text":"Dino's has great food. the Greek Pizza was awesome. The server was very attentive and the owner walked around and made her rounds. During dinner there was a piece of melted plastic on the pizza and i didn't realize it until i bite into it. I advised the owner and she made sure to take care of the issue. She gave us our pizza for free and made sure i was ok. She also said that if i continue to have issues or need to go to the doctor to let her know. Well i was sore for a couple of weeks but i healed ok. This restaurant earned 2 new customers and because of the service we recieved is the main reason why i will return to dinos"}
{"text":"We can in last Sunday with a group of 9 and were greeted and seated promptly. We started with the bruschetta and hummus, both were fan favorites at the table. My husband, and several others at the table, ordered the gyro with either fries or salad and everyone seemed to enjoyed it. I ordered sliders off of the appetizer menu and it was served with three sliders (seemed to be a mixture of beef and lamb but hard to tell), with tzatziki and feta as well as fries. I enjoyed the mix of flavors in my dish and their ranch dressing was very good. Prices were reasonable for the portions, maybe a bit on the high end. Service was consistent and good throughout the meal. Overall, this was a great first experience."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place out but I left disappointed.  Ordered pizza and pasta and all anyone could taste was chili pepper.  Spaghetti and meat sauce?  Chili pepper.  Baked pasta and cheese?  Chili pepper.

The cheese pizza was cold and bland.

The one positive was the tzatziki dip.  Now that was good.  I'd definitely order that again.

The restaurant itself was also pretty warm inside.  And frankly, the food was entirely too expensive for what was served."}
{"text":"I had the Gyro Pita and it was delicious. My husband picked it up and brought it home, complained it was a bit slow but other then that clean. My only real complaint is the french fries were terrible! Tasted like they had been left over and re cooked to heat up. Will try again but not the fries!"}
{"text":"We were traveling from Tucson to California, and pulled off the highway looking for food. We saw the sign on the side of the road for a special at this place and thought it would make a great alternative to the traditional fast food available while traveling. They have a special daily from 11a to 3p - A gyro and a drink for $5.99 each.   Food was very tasty, the place was busy, and overall a good stop. Food came out fast and we were on our way"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for Valentine's day for 7:30. When we arrived it was 7. We checked in with the crypt keeper, she snapped at me when I told her my name and what time I had reservations. Well I blew her of as I knew she was stressed. She had walk in diners and diners with reservations. I watched her take some crap from a walk up diners (6 people)with no reservations. Guess she knew she would make some fast cash off of big parties, 2 people parties like mine are not huge money makers. They Broke her balls,  begging to be sat, she caved sat them, and forced people with reservations to continue waiting.  When our 7:30 on the button time came, she freaked out as there was my reservation and another couple waiting at the same time. She offered a table in the middle of the room, that was very high traffic, she very bluntly said \"take it or leave it, I won't force you to to stay\".  
I let the other couple that walked in behind me take that table, I INFORMED the hostess that I will wait for a table that is away from hustling wait staff and patrons leaving. We eventually were seated.

The atmosphere is that of a chuck cheese for old snow birds. A group of 10 or more snow birds took all the tables in the center of the room. Loud and drunk on their vodka tonics and heart meds, and smelling of hemroid cream, they were out of control. I was expecting a nice romantic dinner at a greek, medeteranian cuisine restaurant. I had to text my date in order to talk to her.

Honestly I don't remember how the food tasted, we ordered the steak and lobster special. Our server was nice, she came by when she could (drop off drinks and drop off check) the rest of the time I don't know where she was.

If you are going to put on a huge valentine's night dinner special, close the doors and allow reservation holders first pick.  Sadly this place was chasing the dollar, allowing roudy retired adults to act like 3 year old drunks, place was to bright, drop the lighting to set the mood.

I learned my lesson, next year Durants here I come.
DINO'S can eat my ass, there is nothing remotely special about this garbage heap they call a restaurant.  I also suspect the rude nasty hostess was the owner...anyone like that rocking an attitude and doesn't fear getting fired...has to be part owner or is banging the owner. So let me break it down for you Dino's. \"YOU ARE FIRED\""}
{"text":"Greek night with friends on the westside.  I had the lamb sowlaki which was ok, I've had better.  The portions were a good size however not that tasty.  Speaking of tasty, the water tasted funny too. The fried zucchini that we had tasted like it came from the freezer. And the baklava was probably the worst I have had in Arizona.  Really soggy and the cinnamon was overwhelming.  Staff nice yet didn't seem to care to be there and working."}
{"text":"So greeeeeking amazing.... we were total on greek..... The owner Peter and staff were greeeaaate.   Chris the bartender was super attentive.,., Thanks for the fabulous meal and evening.,,,,.... We will do it again and again"}
{"text":"Ordered carryout. Dinner was not hot. If you look at the menu and are then told that you
can pick up in 15 minutes - RETHINK! Wish I had."}
{"text":"I have always liked this restaurant.  The bar has a cozy feel to it and the food is great!  For $20 I had the antipasto, the muscles and a glass of wine.  The muscles were fabulous but the sauce was more salty than I would prefer and the bread seemed stale.  The service was excellent so I was still happy."}
{"text":"Overall good food. The salads are amazing!! I could drink the dressing by itself. The soups are amazing. Sometimes the meat seems a little over done, but I use the sauce to help with the dryness. I wish the place was a little more updated bc it doesn't feel very comfortable in there. This sounds weird, but the smell reminds me of a nursing home. But I keep going back (usually takeout) bc more often than not the food is good."}
{"text":"We've never been disappointed at Dino's. Large portions, tasty dishes, good service. Four for dinner last night, Gyro dinner, Gyro Pita, Chicken Parm, and Cheese Tortellini. All but the Pita came with salads, choice of Greek Salad or Caesar Salad. The three dinners were all too large to finish. Service was just right, there when needed without hovering. We started with the Greek Fries while waiting for the meal, we get them every time. The bill came to $77 with drinks and tax."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Dino's to me. I'm glad I tried it. I'm picky about places I eat at. 

Gyro platter was delicious! Comes with rice and potatoes. Greek salad was delicious! The dressing tasted homemade. The tzatziki was really good too!

Dinners are around $14. The portions are generous. Comes with a soup or salad, the salads come on a medium sized plate, not some tiny side plate.

The ice water tasted fine. (I'm picky about my water!)

Service was friendly and attentive.

I will be back to try the lunch, because the prices are very reasonable for lunch here!

I would recommend this place to a friend or stranger! I would eat here again, as long as it's consistent. 

Located next to Einstein Bagels."}
{"text":"Ok! Enough People, first things first! It's a FAMILY owned restaurant HELLO people if your looking for a chain go down the way to applebee's or something. I absolutely love this place I try to go at least once a week. Ya the service can be kinda slow on a Friday or Saturday. By the way you picked FRIDAY AND SATURDAY!! The busiest time to go to dinner of course your going to wait for awhile. My suggestion is that you ask for the tall guy server with glasses he has been the best server when we go. The others are pretty new so give them a chance to get adjusted. On the food side, I found the food to be awesome I order the same thing every time the Gyro and Greek salad which I found to be really awesome don't forget the Blue Moon, Best Gyro in Town!. So my recommendation is that if you want a family owned not a chain cozy and buzzing with people and have no agenda than I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this restaurant.  The decor isn't the best and dining room is just so-so.  Nothing special.  I usually arrive early, eat at the bar, and chat with the bartender while watching a game on tv.

The menu is extensive.  I counted four different Gyro's on the menu.  Four!  Which by the way is what I always order.  They range from $8 - $20 depending on what comes with them.  The dinner Gyro is so big you have to use a knife and fork, which is just fine by me.

The owner is usually there hustling around and seems friendly.

The patio is nice if it's cool enough out.  Much better than the dining room for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always enjoyed both my meal and service. 

Benefits:

The owner is usually circulating about and will often check to see how things are going.
Staff are all friendly and helpful
Happy hour is decent with good on-tap beers as low as $3
Menu is varied and something for everyone. There's both Italian and Greek dishes as well as some steak type options. Even a decent pizza selection.
Prices will run from about $9 to close to $30 (steak combo)
Nice sized patio -it does sit on the corner of McDowell and Dysart, so you'll get some street noise, but it's not horrible
Monday and Tuesday are all you can eat pasta nights 
Lunch has a good gyro special at $5.99 with a drink

Overall this is a great local owned and operated restaurant. It's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Terrible atmosphere, rude staff, loud obnoxious regulars as the owners just look at you as if you have 3 heads. This is not my first time to this mediocre restaurant but after last night's service it will be my last."}
{"text":"Pretty good + huge portions

Visited Dino's with some family in town.  

Greek salads were not all that Mediterranean, but still yummy.  Pretty much everyone in our group went with the Gyro Platter, which is HUGE!  None of us was able to finish everything on it.  The gyro meat is what you expect, pita bread was soft and warm, and the rice was rich.

The waitress was really pleasant, though we went stretches without visits.  She was handling the entire restaurant and four larger groups were there counting ours.  I'm sure she would have been more attentive if there were another wait person.

Not remarkable, but still a good spot for a Greek meal in the Avondale/Goodyear area.  And if you're looking for lots of food for your dollar, this is definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"We came in on a rainy boring Saturday night & had a great time trying dishes ! The Moussaka is to die for ! Love the platter & all the specialties"}
{"text":"IT IS ACTUALLY STILL IN GOODYEAR  AT THIS NEW LOCATION, THE WEST SIDE IS GOODYEAR AND EAST SIDE IS AVONDALE-

\"Dino's is moving! After June 1st they will be located at the SW corner of Dysart and McDowell in Avondale next to Einstien Bagels. I believe the last day at current location is the 27th. Bigger and Better!\""}
{"text":"Dino's has good, healthy home-style cooking with excellent service.  This is a family-run establishment with all cooking from scratch!  Homemade soups are excellent.  There is a full bar.  Entrees are full meals, including soup or salad, (which is getting harder to find in this a la cart world).  Dino's is an excellent value.  I recommend the Spanakopita (spinach pie), Lamb, Peter's Special Prawns (bacon wrapped), Garlic Prawns, Ribs and Baked Lasagna, Mussels in a tasty broth, and Calamari (lots of tentacles, best I've had).  Everything is good.  They should consider offering a meal plan:  I could eat there very day!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Dino's for lunch. Both times I've been very pleased. Service is great food is even better. I get the lunch special which is a Gyro pita and drink for $5.99 I add the Greek salad for $1.99 because it's amazing!! Love this place definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Dino's.... we'd go back...

Food - eh, we didn't hate it the first time and went back for a second go(after all the popular places on Estrella had a 2hr wait).  Can't complain about the food - it's what you'd expect if you want a slight upgrade from Olive Garden. I wouldn't take anyone here to impress...

Service was great though.  We brought our 18 month old, who can be a slight \"pain\", and our waitress was more than willing to accommodate his \"palette\"....

Bottom line, we'll be back. It's close to home and if they offer Soup, Salad and Breadsticks, we'll be there daily!"}
{"text":"Saw a guy holding a sign on the corner of Dysart and McDowell advertising a Gyro deal and realized I had never seen the place before. Went in the next day and was seated quickly with a menu. Looked it over casually, knowing I already wanted to get a gyro since it seems difficult to find a good one in this part of town. Noticed they had calamari as an appetizer and ordered that with a gyro. 

The calamari was very good. A lot of places fry it to death and you end up with a chewy wad of batter. Theirs was excellent. The gyro was the 2nd best I've had in the valley, which is saying something considering how many I've tried and immediately forgotten. I will definitely be going back here again and it will likely be my go-to spot for gyros."}
{"text":"I had the gyro and the meat was good, the pita fresh. They skimped on the tzatziki sauce and the red onion was chopped rather than julienne style, so they kept tumbling out of the pita. The served steak fries, which was  big bummer for me as I prefer the thin fries. However, I overheard another customer asking about the \"old\" thin fries, and they are coming back. I will get it a go again in a few weeks and try in again."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place? We come all the time. It is the best kept secret in the area. The food is FAR better than the chain restaurants, owners are on-site and watching the quality of every plate. Very broad menu - pizza is great, so are all the Greek and Italian dishes. The wife rates the hamburgers among the best in the area! For those who want, they have a full bar with a very loyal group of friendly regulars who may actually live there, I'm not sure. In any case, this is a super-reliable owner-operated, neighborhood gem with something for everyone. Amazingly, you hardly ever have to wait in line, even weekends. You won't go back to the chains after you have fresh-cooked food here. They have started having holiday celebrations - those require reservations."}
{"text":"First impressions mean a lot in the restaurant business.  Sadly this place is out of the way and does not get the street attention it might otherwise deserve.  

We went here last night for dinner, a Sunday, another off night for me to be rating a place but the experience was good nonetheless. 

Not being overly hungry but not wanting to cook either, we thought we'd give it a try.  Margaret has been there several time in the past but this was my first visit.

We were greeted and seated by a pleasant hostess, or possibly a waitress, I am really not too sure.  There is nice window seating and the sunset is visible and quite beautiful.

Unsweetened Ice Teas for both of us to start.  Margaret had the Baba Ganoush with Pita Bread and I chose the Calamari dinner.  For only $6 more than the appetizer, the Calamari dinner comes with Potatoes, Rice, Vegetables, Pita Bread as well as a soup or Greek Salad....We shared the sides as she is not a squid fan and that's a shame as they were quite good, even with Tzatiki Sauce as opposed to Marinara.  

The food came out fast, a little too fast actually.  I had only taken about 3 bites from my salad when the dinner arrived.  Everything was hot and fresh and it made me look forward to coming back and trying something on my next visit.  

This was one of the few places to have dessert as I generally pass on that but the waitress says they were all home made items and the Tiramisu and Baklava were great so I chose to go Italian for dessert and take home a slice of the Tiramisu for later.  Great choice!!

The verdict?  Definitely a place to go for the west siders!!  Based on locale, it might just be word of mouth that gets this place noticed as its so far off the beaten path to stop by accidentally.  I will be back, there are some other great looking dishes I have to try out! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here 6pm, almost every table taken up, no seats at bar. Ordered dolmathes and calamari which were reeeeally good!! I've been to their Goodyear location for their gyro which compared to others found in west valley is A++... Service was really good too, always checked on. Will come back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant, I was looking for some good Greek food nearby, so I gave this place a try. I sat in the bar at lunch time, which was empty when I got there. The gentleman working the front (Dino) and the bar told me he'd be back in a few minutes, he was clearly frazzled and seemed super busy, although I'm not sure why, it wasn't busy at all. He eventually came back and said, What do you need?\" Anyhow, I asked him what his favorites were, again, his response was short and rude, does this guy smile???!! He took my order after having to wait 20 minutes for him to ask, I ordered the gyro pita with the Greek salad, both no tomato, which I got, lots of them, on both. Once the food was fixed, it was actually very good, the 3 stars I gave because the food was great at a really good price. However, Dino ruined the whole experience for me, the manager on duty and the other lady serving, weren't anymore helpful, not once did anyone ask me if I needed anything or how the food was, til I was already done. Dino eventually apologized for the wait and for running around like an idiot (his words) but it was too little too late. Your service was awful, but your food is great."}
{"text":"My parents went to this place shortly after it opened. During their meal, their waitress went into the back, grabbed her coat, and walked out the front door. So, yes, their waitress quit during her shift. (Makes you wonder what my parents are like, eh? Hehe.)

My parents enjoyed the food, though, so they decided to take me and my brother there to give the place another chance. We started w/the appetizer platter, which had dolmades (grape leaves), baba ghannoush (eggplant dip), hummus, tzatziki (yogurt dip), spanikopita (spinach and feta pie), meatballs, and maybe another thing or two I don't remember. It was all served w/pita. The huuuuge platter was more than enough as an appetizer for the four of us (although my dad didn't eat too much). Dill is a prominent player on the platter, spiking the tzatziki and even the hummus (a nice tough, as garlic is usually the overwhelming flavor). I don't typically like spanikopita, as I find feta too salty, but the spanikopita at Dino's wasn't heavy on the feta, leaving the pouch of pastry flaky and delicious instead of salty and inedible. Looooved the spanikopita enough that I'm still thinking about it, a week later... The pita was served in small wedges, and it seemed pretty bottomless based on the fact that our waitress kept bring out more for us. It didn't taste like authentic pita bread that they actually baked in the back. It wasn't actually pocket bread, but was rather thick and kind of spongy. But hey, this is Phoenix. Can you find *real* pita out here, anyway?

My mom and I split the lamb souvlaki, which was two skewers of lamb chunks served w/rice, potatoes, and vegetables. The dish was just right for the two of us, and we even had a bit left over. The lamb was not gamy in the least, and the charred outside went perfectly well with the pink inside. This lamb was treated right. The sides are nothing special, but the roasted potatoes are prepared well and are flavorful.

My brother had some sort of roasted lamb, which was also prepared just right. It too lacked the gaminess lamb can sometimes have. His lamb was tender w/a consistency almost like brisket. It was served w/the same sides as the souvlaki.

My dad, unadventurous eater that he is, opted for the Veal marsala. He said the mushrooms were \"cut just right\" (that is, sliced fairly thinly--he hates when button mushrooms are simply plopped in). The spaghetti on the side comes w/meat sauce, but my dad opted for the marinara instead. The man had nothing left on his plate, so I take it he enjoyed his food!

Our waitress was great. She joked around w/us and had a fun sense of humor. She answered our questions and was sure to keep our water glasses filled.

Prices are very reasonable. I think the souvlaki was somewhere around $10, while the appetizer platter was maybe $12-15. The four of us ate for $80, which included a very generous tip. Plus, we had leftovers of the appetizer platter, the souvlaki, and the roasted lamb.

The fact that my parents live on the boring side of the Valley kinda sucks, but I'm thankful that Dino's is just a five-minute ride from their house, as good Greek food is hard to come by."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. The service is always excellent, the place is always clean and the Food is fresh and delicious. My personal favorite is the chicken Parmesan sub with fries. The bread is superb, they use just the right amount of sauce and cheese and the chicken is nice and crisp. Best chicken parm I've ever had. Great food, nice people."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out for a nice evening and requested outside seating.A half hour into our meal outside a group of smokers came out and smoked us out while we were trying to have dinner. Tried talking with the group of people and they were very rude because I had asked them to politely stop smoking while we enjoyed our dinner since they had already enjoyed there's inside. I then went inside to talk w the owner and he explained that he knew the rude people  and that it was ok to smoke out there after 8. We felt very disrespected and all because we wanted to enjoy our meal outside. We have recommended this place to many people but after tonight we will never go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Our service was very good. The ambience was very peaceful, it's a beautiful restaurant."}
