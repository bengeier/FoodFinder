{"text":"Breakfast buffet was not that good, eggs were cold and crusty, supply was low.. save your 10 $$ I Would not go back"}
{"text":"Last night it was reinforced that, while this Eat'N Park in particular is further than three others, it's worth the drive. Always fast, friendly service. Their ability to accommodate is always appreciated. Even if we show up with 12 people, they're ready.   Food is on point and delicious. Whether we stop for lunch or late night dessert. Consistency. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Ok so we are here from Philly for the weekend and being originally from Pittsburgh I told my friends that they had to try eat and park.  Trying to go light, most order oatmeal. A fairly safe bet for breakfast.  Well 3 bowls arrive and there is a 1/4 inch smearing of oatmeal on the bottom of the bowl. I would guess about $0.25 worth of grains for ~$3!!!   Then I ordered a slice of their coconut cream pie cause they make the best.   Yep. That never came. The waitress must have had a bad morning (at least I hope so anyway) cause she looked pissed off every time we asked for something.  And no we were not being overly needed.     So much for the smiley face concept and first impressions on out of towners.  Fail."}
{"text":"This is a decent and very standard Eat n' Park.  I cannot really think of anything that stands out to share with you.  I've generally had decent service here, but I've had some dropped-balls, too.  The food is very decent, as I expect.  The salad bar is fairly well stocked and serviced, but I've seen them run out of lettuce and out of salad plates a few times (which is, you know, pretty bad for a salad bar).  They do crank lots of patrons through this location and are unfazed by large groups, which is good.  It is not bad at all, it's good, it's just not four-stars good."}
{"text":"Every time i go to this eat n park they mess up my order and thw manager acts like it is my falt the  steak is not steak it's a hamburger there's slow to fill up the salad bar slow refill your drink slow to take your order and when they're out of salads at your fault that you ordered that salad you should have order something else so the manager says I would go to any other eatnpark not this one stay away from the one in Sewickley"}
{"text":"Eat n park is a nice family option. Offering traditional American diner fare, it's also really affordable. Their salad bar is great! Also, it's always nice they're open 24 hours. Don't forget to grab a smiley face cookie before hitting the road!"}
{"text":"Mom and i came here on Sunday,the hostess was good at her job,we got the all you can eat salad bar,our waitress did bring out our drinks but only asked us if we wanted a refill once,and we never saw her again till we asked for our check.the salad bar was a mess,never cleaned of food i do not recommended this place too anyone terrible salad bar and waitress"}
{"text":"The very best thing about this location is that it is open 24/7. Tonight we were there around 10pm. It was interesting to see the other patrons. There were senior couples, young moms having a night out without kids, kids who came from a rave, and then just tables of friends of all ages. Everyone was smiling and talking. It was very pleasant.  My favorite meal at Eat n Park is the Rosemary chicken. Yum!!  Add the Sugar Snap Peas and a baked potato and I am enjoying one of my favorite meals. My favorite dessert is the Grilled Stickies a la mode. It will give you a sugar high!and you can't forget the milkshakes or the ever famous Smiley cookies. I'm the mood for something salty?? Go for the housemate chips with Ranch dressing.  No matter what you are craving you will find something on the menu to tame the craving."}
{"text":"Eat n' Park serves hearty meals at a great value for the money.  They are great with food allergy concerns if you talk to your server."}
{"text":"There's an E 'n P in swanky Sewickley, imagine that. Being all out of ideas and having no time to research virgin restaurant territory for Yelperial jihad, I decided upon this satellite of the venerable chain, one we've zipped by a zillion times without battin' an eye.  Geez, I walked in, and the decor was so trendy looking, I thought I'd be asked to put on a jacket! A high rent Eat 'N Park in a high rent neighborhood, I'm shocked it wasn't gated!   What to order, what to order? Hmmm...I know...  Grilled Chicken Quesadillas!   Aw man, why do they tell you they used jarred salsa? I suppose I should applaud their honesty. Aside from that, the chicken was chargrilled without being at all dry, the chipolte sauce was milky and mildly kickin', the flour tortilla was sturdy yet pliable, and the Pepper Jack cheese was...pepper jack cheese (has there ever been a bad pepper jack?). I've actually had these before at a different E 'N P and enjoyed them back then too.   Consider the Philly Cheese Steak. It's supposed to be \"street\" y'know? It's supposed to drip. It's supposed to be served by a jerk having a ten-year-long bad day. It's supposed to have Cheez Whiz or bechamel or fondue all over it or whatever.  I don't care. This blew apart my expectations, something I chose randomly no doubt because I was dead set again't getting a burger.   How to say this without sounding like the Child Eater from Pan's Labyrinth?  The roll is was served on felt like a baby.  I know I said something similar about Calabria's calzones, but man alive, this sandwich was a joy to hold as well as...ulp...eat?   The steak was choice, the onions were like candy, and the neatly melted American cheese cut in beautifully. Nothing tasted frozen, gummy, reheated. Everything stayed put. No mess, just a damn good sandwich, just the kind I needed to finish my workweek. If I were a drinkin' man, I'd want a pint 'o piss to go along with it.  Instead I got fries and a Pepsi.   I hadn't had grilled stickies in eons, so that's what was for dessert. Who thought to serve these with ice cream, and why haven't they been given a prize of some sort. Why nuke a cinnamon roll when you can butter 'em and put them on a griddle? A microwave cannot create those saltysweetcrispy edges that you forget exist on the things until your nearly finished with them, making your mouth joyous and your heart sad that dessert is close to being over.   Now we gotta go to the E 'N P in Bellevue! It comes before this one when traveling to boom Chippa wah wah. Ask Kay what that's all about."}
{"text":"I came because I had Steelers tickets the day before and was told over the loud speaker that I'd get free super burgers.  We were hungry so we ordered the super burgers (doesn't come with fries or anything with this promotion) and the chicken quesadillas. The staff was friendly, food was decent, and the place was very nice.  No issues getting my discount.  Would recommend and come back again!"}
