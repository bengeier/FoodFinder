{"text":"Place was dead on a Friday night. Walked in around 7:30, grabbed a seat at the bar with a couple buddies.

Bar tenders were friendly. Good beer selection. Had a Bells Two Hearted and a Voodoo HooDoo. 

Food just wasn't anything special. Ordered a Po' Boy. Nothing like you would expect if you're thinkin classic gulf coast. Was on Texas toast style bread. Shrimp were okay, too much breading though. Even with something called ghost pepper cheddar, it lacked flavor. Needed seasoning or something. Salt and pepper, or some old bay? I don't know. Came with a warm pickle and frozen fries.

I'm not in Murrysville often, but I gotta think there's something better than this? Sorry."}
{"text":"Got the nachos for starters which were ENORMOUS and amazing. Also got the Meatloaf melt that has mashed potatoes, gravy, and smoked Gouda cheese... It was perfect. It came with homemade potatoes chips and homemade french onion dip.. Once again, both were very good. Will definitely be back. This is the place if you are looking for any kinda of melted sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place..... only can give review of the giant pretzel, which seemed like it was microwaved because the meals came out cold ... we left and went up the street to eat."}
{"text":"Good place for appetizers and sandwiches. Waiters could be a bit friendlier. Food was good and the place is clean. Depending on day and. Time of day, place can be loud. But all in all, not too bad."}
{"text":"Great vibe,  has a rustic/industrial look. (Edison lights,  exposed brick and wood.  The food was great for bar food. There is a good selection of burgers, grilled cheeses and apps. A beer selection with almost 40 taps along with a pretty good happy hour."}
{"text":"The food was pretty solid but I ordered 5 beers from their draft menu and they were out of all of them and had yet to be replaced as well as about 10-15 already blacked out on the menu.  Seeing as they advertise their beer selection you would think this should not happen"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, we left before we even ordered because of how terrible the staff was."}
{"text":"Stopped in again for the second time... Great experience!

The soup of the day was beef barley with mushrooms... Soooooo good!  Reminded me of my favorite soup growing up... Campbell's Scotch Broth (no longer made)... Wonderful!

Shrimp po boy grilled cheese was great also... Opted for the less spicy habenero cheese sauce (instead of the ghost pepper cheese sauce).

Wife had pulled pork grilled cheese ... Loved it.

No skimping on the sandwich filings here!

The tap beer selection was GREAT ... 

Will come back here soon... The waitress was very attentive and top notch... She really hustled... All the time with a smile on her face.

5 stars from me is a no brainer !!!"}
{"text":"Food was awful the sides and fries were cold and stale, the burger was honestly one of the worst I ever had. My wife ordered a grilled cheese sandwich that looked like road kill, nothing about the sandwich was done correctly. I walked past the kitchen and noticed that there was all young kids cooking  unsupervised, it's ashame you want to pull for small local people but with good like that no way, id rather eat a dog biscuit. Also the beer is way over priced"}
{"text":"Pretty good grilled cheese with egg, bacon and avocado.. fries come in a mini fryer basket. My fiance had a burger..pretty good too...large assortment of beers."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I was so excited to try it but very let down by service and food.  The bartender/waitress was not friendly at all and she knew nothing about the menu.  The food was mediocre at best.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"My neighbor and I stopped for lunch today.  First time ever here.  She ordered a crazy burger and fries.  She said it was delicious.  I ordered the BLT w egg.  It was truly amazing.  LOVED IT.  It needed salt (why are cooks so afraid of salt).  The fries are displayed nicely in a wire fryer basket but are the normal coated frozen fries you get anywhere.  Coleslaw was creamy and good.  All in all, I loved it and will go back!!!  Sorry to the waitress who had to clean up the cup of coffee I dumped on the floor.  Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed......
Was hoping for something different than the typical burger/sandwich and fry place.     We tried two different sandwiches and a burger.  All were greasy, bland and just ok.  The blue cheese was non existent for the most part of the burger.  The fries are the same nasty crunchy coated frozen ones that other local places are using.
The beer selection is pretty decent ( both bottles and drafts) and they have a nice descriptive menu for it.

They did a really nice job of remodeling and the bar setup is cool.
The service was good and attentive, but this is a 1 and done based on the food."}
{"text":"This place is a hot mess right now. The front of house and kitchen need some real organization. Neither my or my date's orders came out right. 

Good beer selection. I wouldn't hesitate to go there for drinks at the bar. Food is mediocre pub grub. Most of the items are covered in jalapeños or ghost pepper cheese. I suppose that's to keep the beer flowing. However, that makes things pretty unappetizing for kids and anyone not looking to melt their face. 

Don't know if I'll go back. That's a shame since I was hoping for something good and non-chain in the east burbs."}
{"text":"Interesting sandwich selection. Really like the ghost pepper cheese, adds great flavor & heat to the sandwiches. Nice selection of beers also."}
{"text":"Decent food and very rude service. I asked for a gluten free menu and she told me they don't have one and there was nothing I could eat there. That's not accurate- they do have salads and could easily leave off croutons but she was clearly inconvenienced by my question and wasn't interested in dealing with me. Someone in my party didn't know what she wanted right away and the server didn't like that much either. I had a caprese salad which was actually pretty good. The other people in my party said the food was ok. Let me be clear- I do not expect people to make extreme accommodations for me in a restaurant. I just don't like to be made to feel unwelcome for asking the question. There is no excuse for rude service."}
{"text":"I had the prime rib sandwich.  It was decent, but I'm not sure it was $14.00 decent.  The beer selection was pretty good, and the fries were pretty tasty.  Before our food came-the power went out.  Mind you...it was sunny outside and there were no storms in the area. The waiter happened to mention that this had happened before.  For some strange reason, one TV kept working and the lights in the bathroom stayed on.  Regardless, we were served and ate our dinner in the dark.  Despite this (major) inconvenience, not so much as 1 penny was deducted from our bill.  This place isn't bad, but it isn't great either.  It would be even better with reliable electricity."}
{"text":"After seeing on their Facebook page that they were kid friendly I was sad when I brought my small fry to meet some friends for lunch and they did not have cups with lids or a kids menu. I think they are still ironing out the final menu, so maybe one is to come soon. They do have a basic grilled cheese. They have a great craft beer selection with lots of local choices. This is a good spot in Murrysville to sneak out and grab a couple of beers and a bite. Leave the kiddos at home."}
{"text":"I liked the food, lived up to it's description! Service was good, too. Great place if you want to catch a quick bite and a drink. Lots of beers!"}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Friday at 6pm. The waiting area is very small so most patrons wait at the large bar for a table to open up. The draft list is what to come her for, try something new! I only had appetizers this night. The pierogies were standard but the fried mashed potato balls are highly recommended. I can't wait to come back for a full meal."}
{"text":"This place was good. I would not say don't eat here because the food is good and the beer selection is nice. It just was not out of this world. If I could I would do 3.5 stars. Worth the visit and the try"}
{"text":"Went over the weekend and this place was a total bust. Our party of 4 waited over an hour for grilled cheese???? 3 of us got our food before the last sandwhich came out 10 minutes later. Our service was also lousy. Waitress complained to us how much she hated her job and how the kitchen staff was \"a bunch of idiots who barely have a GED\" Our first and last experience here."}
{"text":"I am a professional competitive fitness athletes who eats 40-42 super clean meals a week so when it comes time for a fun cheat meal (once a week) it better be awesome, I wasnt disappointed! Creative, well-cooked sandwiches and huge appetizers make this just a wickedly fun place for lunch or dinner. I cant wait to go back! With a clean, trendy atmosphere and many craft brews on tap along with a full bar this sandwich, grilled cheese, gourmet soup establishment will be a real hit this fall. Absolutely a great place to visit if your in the Murrysville area,,,,I live in Saxonburg and the 45 minute drive is well worth it!"}
{"text":"They no longer have the meatloaf, but still have it on the menu.  They cross off the beer they don't have on the beer menu, but not the items in the regular menu.  Would be nice if they told us before hand that they no longer have it."}
{"text":"Always fairly good.  I'd go 3.5 if Yelp did half stars (seriously, why don't they do half stars?).  But I'll round up.  Service is fine, food is decent.  My husband is a bigger fan than me; to me, it's too salty.  But he enjoys the beer selection too.  It could definitely be better based on the theme... I've had better grilled cheese and 'fancy' grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Wide selection of food and drink. Upscale bar food with trendy atmosphere and decent hospitality. Unique to the Murrysville area but would pale in comparison to option closer to downtown Pittsburgh. Overall good experience and would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here lastnight for dinner. I honestly wasn't impressed with my meal(the boss) it wasn't fully cooked. The fries were delicious. My boyfriend got the pot roast meal, he loved it. I find it odd that our food was ready in less than 10 mins. I wouldn't come again for a meal cause it's over priced but the alcohol selection is amazing. We'd def come back to get some drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner on Friday night with a guest from out of town.  The bar was LOUD, but we realized too late that there was available seating in the back.  We had the Sweet Carolina and G-Man and we both raved the whole time we were eating.  The Carolina had just the perfect amount of heat for me.   The sandwiches weren't cheap but you have to give them points for creativity.   You can't beat the beer selection and the beer prices were very reasonable considering the quality and selection.  Our waitress was friendly and went out of her way to answer all of our questions.  Great dining/drinking experience!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not sure how this place has 3 1/2 stars so far. Me and my family started going there weekly because they hosted trivia; trivia and the one waitress we got to know from going there were the only reasons why we kept going back. Their food at best is okay, and it depends on the day that you go in there. There's absolutely no consistency on their staff, the food, everything. On numerous occasions, we would be served soda that was flat, then asked for a new one and the waiter said, \"Oh, yeah, we've been having problems with the machine all day;\" why would you serve us flat drinks or not ask us if we wanted another drink beforehand? Other times my boyfriend would get a burger one week and it would be okay, and then the next week the burger patty was half the size of the bun. Or when making special requests, like no onions on a side salad, they repeatedly would still mess that up. One time I ordered a chicken salad, but with the chicken on the side because I'm a vegetarian yet I still give the chicken to my other family members to eat because you're paying the same price either way, and they sent it out with the chicken on it...I told our waitress that it wasn't right, she took it back and brought it out and said they made a whole new salad fresh for me, yet at the bottom of the dish you could still find pieces of chicken, so they just removed the chicken, mixed up the lettuce a little bit and then lied to us about it. And they're supposed to be a gourmet grilled cheese restaurant with all sorts of grilled cheese specialties, yet I would rather get a grilled cheese right next door at Eat 'n Park."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick stop for a bite and a beer and ended up really enjoying the place.  They have a nice selection of beers and also carry local brew beers.  The wings are great, very meaty with your choice of sauces.  Stop in watch a game, get a beer, eat some wings or enjoy their huge pretzel.  They do allow smoking but it was not to smoking when we were there.  I think it would be a great place to have a cigar and enjoy a beer and appetizer.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Crave is good for a couple things.  Lousy service, terrible TV's (they all share the same HDMI line so they are blurry and not HD quality) and a good beer selection.  When they first opened it was packed and the waits for refills were long.  Now they are never packed and the waits for refills remains long.  The bartenders are in no particular rush to wait on you.  It is not uncommon to sit with an empty glass for five minutes with three other patrons in the bar as the bartender is just doing something other than tending bar.  

The atmosphere is nice lots of wood.  The bar is spacious and the focal point to this establishment.  There is a small dining room towards the back.  Their food is okay, though I honestly haven't eaten here since my first trip shortly after they opened minus a cup of chili I had here one night with my friend and yelp bud Renee.  The chili was good standard chili with a little kick.  Can't complain about that.  The rest of their offerings (mostly sandwiches) are a bit on the pricey side IMHO.  I thought my grilled cheese sandwich was average and could have been made at home for under a dollar not the 8 or 9 that they charge.  Their margins are good in an investment standpoint. 

So come for the beer, they have happy hour and daily specials.  The list is vast so I am sure if you imbibe you will find something to your liking as long as you are ok waiting a while to get it."}
{"text":"I wish you could give places half ratings because we probably would give this place a 3 1/2 rather than a 4. I felt a 3 was too low, so bumped it up a half a star. We went here on a Saturday around 4:30 PM to meet some friends for drinks and a bite to eat.

The service was really good and they had a decent beer list. We ended up staying about five hours and even after we cashed our checks, our server kept coming back to pour us more water.  We grabbed a seat at a booth near the bar and it was big enough that it fit six people pretty comfortably. The bathrooms were small but very clean. There are two bathroom locations, which was nice being that they were so small.

Everybody pretty much got a Mac and cheese sandwich and the fries were very delicious. There are a lot of places we find beer battered fries in the area, so this was a perk for us. As the night went on, we noticed that they had a DJ who started playing. It's not the type of place I think I would ever get up and dance, but the feels were good, thanks to the music.

Everyone really enjoyed the food, and there is even an area in the back where we can sit and eat that is more like a lounge. Wish we would've seen that sooner because we would have went to the back. Shut out to Chris (or Will?), our waiter... Sorry can't for remember his name, but he was wonderful."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Desperately need an edit to their menu. Neither sandwich ordered was hot. Good concept. Poor execution."}
{"text":"Came here last week with a couple of friends who recommended it, as they loved the sandwiches when coming here before!

We went around 7:30/8pm on a Friday night and were seated as soon as we came in - wasn't too busy, which I was kind of surprised as it was a Friday night, but was happy not to have a wait! First impressions are that Crave is a pretty standard \"hipster\" type of place and vibe  - wood covered walls, Edison bulbs, chalk boards, metal accessories - reminiscent of Sienna Mercato and some other places around the city. The hostess was nice and our waitress was also very friendly and attentive. 

We started with the caprese salad, side salad with homemade honey mustard dressing (they make all sauces and dressings in house at this place, which I also appreciated), and \"Potato Bombs\"  - which were AMAZING. Crispy on the outside and creamy mashed potatoes with bacon on the inside, served with sour cream - SO tasty. For entrees, fiancé went with the pot roast grilled cheese, while I had the pulled BBQ brisket grilled cheese, with habanero cheddar and onion straws. My sandwich was pretty good, but I actually wanted more CHEESE on my grilled cheese, especially at a place that specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches. Fiancé's pot roast however, was really tasty, and I preferred it over mine. He thought it was a bit too salty with the large amount of butter on his toasted bread, but I thought it was delish and pretty indulgent. I would want to try something a bit more \"cheesy\" next time, but overall everything was pretty good. Fries were also really good - double fried, my favorite kind. Their homemade chips were also delicious (MUCH better than the ones at Burgatory) and they had a sour cream and onion seasoning on them - not just salted and fried potatoes. 

They soli happy hour specials too and some fun drink options. I just went with a Sam Adams seasonal for 3.50 for happy hour and my friend had a fishbowl - it was a tequila/rum based drink and was pretty good as well - very strong! 

I would come back here for something more cheese laden and they also had a solid apps menu I would want to try more from too. If you're in the Murrysville area, this is good option, as it isn't overly crowded like the new plaza with Burgatory, North Park Lounge, and Moe's. A short drive further down 22 can help prevent a long wait!"}
{"text":"I was worried. When we first walking in we had an awkward greeting from the hostess. I should say, no greeting from the hostess. She stood there and stared at my husband and I without a \"Hello\" or \" Welcome to...\". I finally said 2 then she asked if we wanted to sit at the bar due to happy hour and we said no ,that we prefer a table. You would have thought we asked for something outrageous from the look we got. We were sat and we both immediately, jokingly, commented that maybe we gave the wrong answer . However we saw other people seated at tables so we were thinking maybe she just didn't want to walk us to the seating area. 
 So we started off on a bad foot and I just had to make an effort to look past the awkward encounter and admire the place for what it was. The rustic environment was something that my husband and I both enjoy. The wood and brick combo was well done. It didn't appear cheap or slapped into place but had effort and care. 
  The menu was had some good selections of chip and dip varieties . Mostly the common sort and we selected the Buffalo cheese dip. They have a grilled cheese section with about 14 or so different options. I chose the meatloaf with gouda and my Hubs picked the \"G Man\" . I chose mine based on the recommendation of our great server Megan. The presentation was very nice with the fries being served in a mini fryer basket and we're crisp and delicious.  The dip was spicy, tangy , and satisfying.  The sandwiches where larger than I expected for $12 dollar price and were as every bit as good as described by Megan and the menu. The meatloaf had great spice and flavor by itself. Combine the potatoes topped with gouda and the perfect amount of gravy. You have a winner. I removed the top slice of bread for an open face style and it was filling . I only ate half but I wanted to eat the whole thing. 
  I have to say I will certainly return and try other options. Thank you for the service from Megan and the  food because we nearly missed the opportunity with the greeting when first arriving. I'm excited to have a modern restaurant so close to home that has substance. I enjoy heading into downtown pittsburgh but this place gives me the city style I  \"Crave\" ."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Pittsburgh from San Diego. If you've been to San Diego, you know that it is a great city if you're looking for an excellent craft beer scene. 

I came across Crave via Yelp when looking for craft beer nearby and I'm so glad that we stopped in! Our friends in town let us know that this place is newer, so I feel that the more Yelp love they can get, the better. Looking through the menu, they appear to specialize in a variety of grilled cheese sandwiches. We sat at the bar and ordered a beer flight as well as an app but did not venture into the other parts of the menu. We will though!

So, as someone who lived in San Diego for a couple of years and was born and raised in Southern California.... I feel I can say with some confidence that Crave's craft beer selection rocks! They had some seasonals (Traveler's Jack-O Pumpkin anyone?) and a local favorite (Yuengling). They also had tons of other varieties from sours to blondes to stouts.

Can't wait to go back!! Oh, and the bartender gave us incredible service. She was waiting on the bar, waiting on tables, and running a shift at the same time. She was attentive, friendly, informative and timely. Considering all she had going on, I was pleasantly surprised by that."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Came in for dinner Saturday night with friends. There were 4 of us. We were seated at a large,  very comfortable booth in the bar area. We were immediately greeted by a warm smile and our spectacular waitress Bridget. We ordered a few drinks, 2 at her suggestion, and they were delicious. We ordered our food, some at her, suggestion, and they were fantastic. From beginning to end, our experience was great. It was just an all over pleasurable experience. Thank you so much!!!!"}
{"text":"While the upper crust of Murrysville is across the street at Atria's discussing who has the nicer Lexus, us commoners are at Crave enjoying dynamite food and fantastic craft beers. 

I counted 39 beers on draft, most of them being the 'craft' variety. My family came here on Saturday evening of Valentine's Day weekend and were surprised that there were a few tables left. 

We ordered an enormous pretzel with a beer cheese as an appetizer and for our meals I ordered \"the boss\" which is a huge grilled cheese sandwich with bacon. My wife ordered a chicken salad and my kids had cheeseburger sliders.

Crave specializes in gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches so I urge you to give one a try! They are quite delicious and rather huge. With all that food and beer our bill came to $48 which I didn't think was that bad.  Check out my pictures to see the craft brews on draft and the different gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Menu was well thought out. Had the g man. Also had the fall mule drink which was well done and served properly in a copper mug."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at this establishment and we sat at the bar for lunch. It is new so it was clean and fresh. They seem to specialize in grilled cheese sandwiches (which is a plus in my book). The food came out fast but they also were not very busy at the time. The bartender did seem to disappear for long intervaules. They had 20+ craft beers on tap and a good all around selection."}
{"text":"I liked it. They have a bunch of different craft beers you can try both on tap and in bottles. And then their main thing is that they have many many different kinds of grilled cheeses to pick from. I had the Cuban one and it was great!

The waitress kept apologizing for \"slow\" service which I did not think was slow at all (we are used to not being rushed in Europe more than in America) so she ended up giving us a 50% discount! Even on the beer! So that was a nice surprise and showed that the people working there do care about the customer's experience.

I would definitely go back here to try more grilled cheeses and of course more beer."}
{"text":"Beer and grilled cheese sandwiches? The beverages from young adulthood combined with the food from childhood? Yes, thank you.

Stopped in on an evening when the Penguins were playing a Stanley Cup game. So the place was loud. Really frickin' loud. Fortunately (from my own selfish, solipsistic vantage point) the Penguins didn't score during my time there, or I'd have suffered some serious hearing loss.

The meal was great, with a couple of kickass beers (1554 (black lager), Kentucky ale) to accompany it. Onion rings with dipping sauce? Yes, I think so. A prime rib grilled cheese sandwich? Heck, yeah.

Excellent food, great beer. But sorry about the Penguins' loss that night. Maybe a little hearing loss would have been okay, in retrospect."}
{"text":"Bernie is the best Sunday bartender! Food was amazing and service was even better! Sunday fun day wouldn't be fun without my favorite bartender."}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place but I'd say I liked it.  I went with the OG grilled cheese and had them add jalapeños and some kind of pepper relish to make it spicy.  I really liked the sandwich, but it wasn't as ooey gooey melty as I wanted it (I mean those are the best kinda grilled cheeses, right?) and I ordered tomato soup on the side.  I was expecting more of a creamy tomato soup but it was more of a brothy/ watery soup.  Not generally what I'm looking for with a grilled cheese.  Also, there were a TON of grilled cheese options, but only two were vegetarian, so I would have liked to see more options.  Also, would be great if they had a customizable option where you can build your own grilled cheese based on bread, cheese, toppings, etc.  The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was restaurant bar-ish.  I would try it again but next time I'd try something different."}
{"text":"The name of this place had been a put off for us, but after seeing the great reviews, We thought we would give it a try. Walking in, the place is clean and inviting with staff welcoming you. After reviewing the menu we were excited to order for what sounded like tasty food. We ordered the chips to start, they came quickly but it was clear they had been sitting awhile and turned into a lovely hard greasy mess. Its ashame because the dip provided was very good and the seasoning on the chips tasted good. I had ordered the big grill cheese with bacon and sadly it was also hard and burned.. I am not sure how you mess up grill cheese but they did. He had ordered the western burger and was very happy with it. It's so sad when places have such good potential and fail to make the bar... it really seemed like every thing was pre-made and heated up when ordered. . Which is a big NO No! Maybe we will try it agian but not for awhile. They did have a great Beer selection, with local brews."}
{"text":"In the last few months, Crave has really gone down hill.  It pains me, but it's true.  This used to be our FAVORITE place - we'd take our out of town guests here, we're buy gift cards for friends here, we were definitely regulars and we loved Jodi (the bartender) - she was legit!  However, she left a few months ago and I have to admit, everytime we've gone back since (maybe 4 or 5 times), it's been terrible.  The management allows employees to sit at the bar, which completely engulfs the bartenders attention.  Multiple times now, we've been \"neglected\" because the current bartenders were too busy carrying on with the employees sitting at the bar.  The food hasn't been great, either.  I can't contribute that to Jodi leaving, obviously, but it's an unfortunate series on events because there is now NOTHING drawing us back.  The language used by the employees and the bartenders is completely inappropriate given their surroundings, the service is awful (unless of course you enjoy being ignored), and the food has become nothing more than so-so.  It's super disappointing, but we haven't gone back recently and won't be returning anytime soon. 

(FYI, Jodi now works at Rivertown Pour House in Monroeville ;) We stopped in there a few weeks ago for a quick bite and a drink and ran into her working! Maybe that'll become our new \"spot\", ha!)"}
{"text":"5 stars based on the food and beverages! Staff is okay. There is one waitress there and I am not sure of her name, but she is fantastic and seems to have been there the longest. One complaint: has anyone tried to change a baby on the koala care in the ladies bathroom? Lol! You have to be 7 feet tall to use it properly! The fries are awesome! I recommend the ones with gravy and pulled pork!"}
{"text":"The main reason I'm writing a review is that I can't believe the previous bad reviews I've read on here. I've been there twice and had the Cuban which was not just good but one of the best I've ever had and I've had authentic Cubans in Miami. The 2nd time I split a Pot Roast sandwich and a salad with my wife. The sandwich was okay...the salad was good. My wife ordered and that wasn't what I would have ordered. Great beer selection and the bartenders and servers were very nice. Give this place a chance and decide for yourself. It certainly deserves better than 2 and 1/2 stars. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a new place and when we saw the Crave sign we figured we'd give it a try as we are \"good beer and bar food\" people. Although it's a smaller building, it has a good size bar and plenty of TV's at the bar. We sat at the bar and our service was great, answering all our questions about the menu and making some great suggestions. Both our appetizer and sandwiches were nice changes to what you find elsewhere. While they may be just a little high in price compared to other places, the beer prices were good and a great selection. We will definitely be going back and have already told some other people about it."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner on Saturday night. We looked to sit in the back dining room but it was full, so we sat at a booth in the bar area. 

I chose the BLT that they offered \"Cali\" style meaning a thick slabbed bacon, tomato, cheese with avocado and fried egg on Texas white toast. I opted out of the avocado. I chose the shrimp bisque (for an up charge) instead of the fries or homemade chips. Soup was hot, with a tasty tomato base, which was good. The sandwich  quickly became mushy and fell apart. I tried to cut it into fourths but the thick slab bacon made cutting and chewing near impossible. Thank goodness for the stack of napkins on the table!

Hubby had the Reuben on seedless grilled rye (without the sauerkraut). Meat was lean and plentiful. He chose the fries which were nothing special. Both sandwiches were in the $10-12 range.

We chose the chocolate cake with a bottom layer of fudge, then vanilla ice cream with the cake on top served in a mason jar. It was a fairly decent $5 dessert.

There were many different drinks and brews on tap, which I believe is the main draw to this place. People were bringing their young kids and sitting in the dining room (was full) and bar area. I wouldn't bring kids to eat here. It's definitely a bar atmosphere and not a family-style restaurant.

The bar was half full but very noisy and the music was loud. 

I was not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband spotted this as we were driving to Indiana PA. We decided to stop and have lunch on our way back home the next day. 
When we walked in we really liked the style of the place. The bar is in front with booths on the sides. If you keep walking toward the back there is a dining room. Beyond that are restrooms and a casual hang out area with couches and a coffee table. 
We were seated and started checking out the menu. We ordered the Potato Bombs as an appetizer because they got great reviews. I wasn't a huge fan but my husband enjoyed them. They are mashed potatoes rolled into balls and fried. The outside is crispy and the potatoes were warm but I just wasn't wow' by them. 
For lunch I ordered the steak grilled cheese with a side of fries. I asked for the sauce on the sandwich be served on the side since I wasn't sure if it were spicy. My sandwich was very tasty. There was a lot of steak and the cheese was melts and gooey just like you hope for. The sauce was served on the side and it was really tangy and was perfect for the sandwich. The fries were served in a little metal basket. They were crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. My husband ordered the Po Boy and he said it was wonderful. He chowed the whole thing down pretty quickly.  It was very spicy which he loved but I can't eat. 
The food was really good but the service was lacking. There was only one waitress for an almost full dining room. She also seemed to lack knowledge of the food when we asked questions. 
We will definitely go back to try more menu items. Who can resist gooey grilled cheese???"}
{"text":"I have really tried to like this place. My husband hates to eat here. I promised if we went tonight and he didn't like it, I would not ask again. Well... his chili was cold... so cold the cheese could not melt on top. The tomato on his burger was the end piece with the black space where the Stem is....would the cook want that on his burger?! I think not!  My grilled cheese sandwich was off tasting. Like it was grilled on an old dirty grill. Just bad. I hate when hubby is right!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't what is the best part about this place. The rustic/to mod atmosphere or the great selections of drafts on hand that are enhanced by some awesome apps and entrees! Service was excellent and even at its busiest (which we were there for their 1st anniversary night which featured Sam Adams selections). The fries were PERFECT and the price about what you'd expect. We had a few other things to eat but you be the judge. TRY CRAVE!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and drinks. My husband and I stopped in on a whim after checking out the local good will. I was impressed that their menu specialized in grilled cheese sandwiches, thus the name \"melt\". 

Their menu has about 10 or 12 different sandwiches each with a melted cheese on it. I ordered the wicked tuna melt and the hubby ordered the Rachel. His sandwich was huge and covered in thick slices of turkey, coleslaw, cheese and a sauce. My sandwich came with tuna and cheddar, lettuce, diced onion and tomato. The bread had been perfectly grilled and the you could really taste the buttery flavor. The tuna was excellent plenty of flavor and not too messy. THe cheese complemented this sandwich so greatly. I've been back twice since my first visit. Another sandwich we tried was the carolina and cubano. I really like the carolina because it was topped with pulled pork or beef, onion straws and BBQ. The cubano came with pork, pickles, mayo and a few toppings. This sandwich was good but could have been better with a different kind of bread. I felt the bread was a bit too thick and it kinda cut down on the flavor of the meat and toppings. I could taste the pickles mostly but no meat.

My mother order a black and blue burger and she loved it! She rarely gives anything more than a \"it's ok\" so I was surprised at her reaction. I took a bite of her burger and indeed it was great. Bread was perfectly soft and not too thick. Toppings of bacon and blue cheese gave the burger that amazing flavor. All of the sides were good, onion rings, french onion soup and ranch potato chips. 

I highly recommend this place for a fun bite and reasonable price. They have drink and wing specials, Karaoke, along with food specials."}
{"text":"Crave is located in a strip mall in Murrysville and is easy to miss. We passed it dozens of times on the way to or from somewhere else. Finally we stopped by for lunch and were glad we did. I heartily recommend this place. Great grilled cheese. I'll have more after the next visit."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, went there during happy hour. The bartenders where busy and running food orders to the bar table area as well as serving drinks. So wait times where a little longer than normal.
Cubano sandwich is best Cuban I've had outside of Florida. 
It thinned out a little after 7 so got to enjoy our meal. Bartender comped a beer for my birthday. Saw me opening a card. Nice touch."}
{"text":"My husband and I met another couple for drinks and dinner on a Friday night. Great happy hour drink specials at the bar. Awesome beer selection. Very crowded and noisy. Bar service was very slow. Once we got a table, the service did not get any better. Two of the four dinners were cold and we ended up walking up to the bar for drinks. I will give it another try in a few months. Hoping they just need to work put the kinks. Remodel does look great!"}
{"text":"This place seemed like the Pittsburgh version of Melt so I was really excited to try it. My bestie and I came here over the weekend hungry and left satisfied. 

I ordered the West Coast BLT and received the Sweet Carolina. This first mistake was from the waitress. I took one bite of my sandwich and realized it wasn't what I ordered at all. She gave me a box to keep it free of charge and put in my correct order. When I received my order the second time, an integral part of this sandwich was missing--no avocados! I only realized after eating half the sandwich already. I think this time it was the cook's fault. The waitress came back with a few avocado slices. Not a big deal since they made it right but definitely double check your order!

Pros: portions are good sized. You will probably get leftovers. Waitress is very friendly. The fries are battered or double fried or something and delish! I regret telling my bestie to get their homemade chips b/c they def weren't as yummers. We asked for a lot of dipping sauces 'cuz that's how we roll. The homemade ranch and sweet BBQ were really good here!
Cons: we had an early dinner at 3pm-ish and service was still really slow mostly due to this one talkative lady at a neighboring table. My order was repeatedly wrong. Side items are too small! There were like 15 fries. Man, they went quickly! 

I would come back with my hubby since he's a big fan of Melt."}
{"text":"I was here for a friends birthday party and it was really good. The food was good and the drinks are made well.  The service was friend and fast."}
{"text":"Crave is a new restaurant to the murrysville scene.  My wife and I came here for a evening out on a Saturday night.  Although, they currently have a limited menu currently, they have enough sandwich and beer choices to make for a good meal.  I had \"the hoss\" it was a spicy for me, but delious and went great with my rivertown draft.  My wife had \"the carolina\" which was also good.  Fries come in a mini frying basket, which is cool.

The atmosphere and service at crave were both great.  I will be back, maybe next time to catch a ballgame and have a couple beers."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. The food was decent but, unfortunately, the service was really bad. The restaurant was only half full but our food took forever and two out of the four orders were incorrect. They told us after our food came that they were out of french fries and just brought us something else instead. In addition, the server said they were having a \"cup shortage\" and kept reusing the cups and taking them to the back to refill. It kind of just felt like a test run and not a fully functioning restaurant. Hope they can work out the kinks /:"}
{"text":"It's 130pm on a Thursday May 24th .  The bartender has 6 customers and he is acting like he is in the weeds, he is greeting new customers by saying \"give me a few minutes\".  It took 10 minutes to get my drink after ordering.  The food came out luke warm because the bartender couldn't make the 11 foot trip to the window.  The bartender looks like mister magoo when he uses the computer which I'm guessing is the main issue with his lack of speed.  I've worked in restaurants with dudes like this who get all flustered at the first sign of being busy and it's funny because they can't seem to figure out that all you have to do is just work faster.  This bartender would rather keep his snail pace and make everyone wait, which is probably why he is tending bar at his age.  I asked the bartender for a pickle and he said \"it's going to be a while\" because once again he didn't feel like making the 11 foot walk to the window.  After waiting 5 minutes for the pickle I made the 11 foot walk the window and asked the kitchen myself, only to find out they are out of pickles because whoever does the ordering is a schmuck.  Never got a refill on my drink.  The food is actually really good but this place is clearly mismanaged."}
{"text":"2nd time. Not impressed. Dead at 8:00 pm on a Friday night. Slow service. Out of side dishes. Poor execution of the grilled cheeses, the main theme of the restaurant. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"If you're going to call yourself a \"Tap Room,\" surely you have a contigency plan when multiple beers are kicked...or not. The Wed $7 flight for an IPA imbiber required a couple point-n-pray selections and even a double IPA to complete the quadfecta -- props to Pabst for a decent IPA. Who knew?! As for Melts, let's get some real (Don't Mess With) Texas toast! The sog factor marred an otherwise scrumptious sammie."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch yesterday. We always have a difficult time choosing and agreeing on a place but I had heard a recommendation for a coworker so I wanted to try it. I'm not a beer person so this type of place would not normally get my attention. However I had heard that they offered a cider that was outstanding and I was curious.
We sat down and received menus within moments. I mentioned that cider that was recommended to me and was offered a sample. It was outstanding and this is coming from someone hates beer and has never been impressed with a hard cider.
Normally when I see a reuben on a menu my decision is instantly made but they had numerous creative and interesting options. We ordered the Piggy Fries right away and spent more time looking at the menu. Eventually I ordered a grilled cheese that had meatloaf, mashed potatoes and melted gouda in it. My wife got the pork and sauerkraut. The appetizer was great but given how stuffed I was at the end of the meal I would probably opt not to get one again in the future. When my entree arrived it was a very large sandwich and I knew I would be full long before my meal was done. 
Everything I tasted there was outstanding. I've worked in restaurants and food service for over 3 years. I hate going out to eat so I'm thrilled when I find a quality place with food that hits the spot. The bonus is also how extremely close the restaurant is to my place. The service and food were a very pleasant surprise and I'm very glad we chose this as a spot for our anniversary meal and I hope to stop back for many other meals here as well."}
{"text":"Pot roast French fries are so good....all of the sandwiches I have tried have been delicious too!"}
{"text":"Crave melt & tap has the BEST food around ... far better then any chain restaurant. Now that they have weeded out the staff that was robbing them blind.... they are rebuilding a new customer base that is not use to getting every thing for free! Yes the old customers like to slam Crave for trying to stop the thievery because they do not want to pay for the items they never had to in the past. Well for those of us who LOVE Crave and the owners, Dom and Vince and the FOH house manager Mark, we are happy that Crave now has a fighting chance to stay in business... I will continue to support Crave . love love love it!"}
