{"text":"Not impressed.  Used to love Mapleside.  Slow service.  Had to spit out the corn bread (rancid oil) ??? And the slimy cole slaw.  Manager was patronizing regarding our concerns.  Did give us free ice cream and passes to the play area.  Validation would have been more appreciated.  Basically said the rest of it was fine, didn't know why ours wasn't good."}
{"text":"Went to Melrose on Sunday, we waited an hour for a table which was to be expected, come to find out the dining room was half empty with dirty tables which seems to be why the wait was so long then the waitress informs us that it was buffet only which was sub par which is being generous, the service was lacking for a buffet style service in a restaurant that is typically a full service venue.  We will not be back to Melrose."}
{"text":"Dinner was great: a few things not to my liking, but I'm generally a picky eater. We started out with the Farm Fries appetizer. SOOO GOOD! We got them without tomato or scallions, and they tasted just like a potato skins. I also got a side Caesar salad. the dressing was very light, and i didn't like the croutons at all, but i ate the whole salad, so i suppose it passed the test. Got the New York Strip steak... Cooked just right, big and juicy. Delicious. It came with lyonnaise potatoes, I have no idea what that preparation is, but I'm a potato fanatic so I tried them... Not a fan. I don't know if they are supposed to taste like that or not, but I didn't like them. But, as my stars indicate, overall great food, service was good too. Got the food fast but the check took a tid bit longer, but not unbearable. Just wish that they had desserts!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork was very good. Ribs were nice and meaty.  Service was timely.  Steak special on Thursday is very good.  Have been there 4 times since Thanksgiving and the food and service continues to improve."}
{"text":"Today I learned the Melrose is a cross between Red Delicious and Jonathan apples.  And the view from the back windows span 60 miles.  The food that came to interrupt this view was party good.  The beef brisket sandwich had nice sauce (could have had a little more sauce), tender beef, and came with sweet potato fries.  Their ribs were large in size (half slab filled half of large plate) and fell off the bone when threatened with a gentle pull.  The menu is pretty streamlined, and not a great deal of options listed if you do not like sweet potatoes.  They have really made the place more distinctive with the decor.  Very interesting chandelier over bar - Upside down apple tree with multi colored apples for lights.  Looks like a big improvement over Mapleside Farms, but I will miss the BBQ Pork Loin from previous restaurant."}
{"text":"Try the Apple Butter BBQ Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a nice lunch while visiting Mapleside Farms, especially since the new owners took over, but I was wrong. I should have listened to the other Yelpers. The view although pretty, was hard to concentrate because the dining area was infiltrated with bees and flys. Not good. Then the soup I had was cold, and just plain awful, it tasted like baby food, I post the picture of it so take a look. 

Our meals were cold, hard to cut and just not tasty. It's not like they were busy either, it was only like 11:40am-12pm. Just not a good restaurant. The prices were okay but still for how bland everything tasted, it wasn't worth it. 

Sorry Melrose, the view is the only thing worth going for at Mapleside"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced, but never had a bad meal here. Always happy with the food and service...and great view of the farm."}
{"text":"To add to what everyone else has said Melrose, surprisingly, is a great concert place on a Friday night.  Make sure to take in the amazing view."}
{"text":"The newly remodeled Melrose Grill @ Mapleside Farms is a nice change of pace. You won't find an iron chef in the kitchen. You will find comfort food staples like meatloaf, airline chicken, various smokehouse selections, pastas and stone oven inspired pizzas. The food was very good, nothing fancy. The charm of the restaurant makes this at least worth a trip. We went for a late dinner and enjoyed a sunset over the apple farm. Only Lake Erie has sunsets that rival the sunsets at Mapleside Farms.  3 1/2 stars."}
