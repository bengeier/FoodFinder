Superb and AWESOME Delicious. Gerard has been Chef for 35 years! Cookie in the Old Way on a wood Stove which allowed His perfect Cuisine.  Christine surprised us with her Signature loaves of Warm Baked Bread. WOW! Starting with robust Homemade mushroom Soup, Old World French Onion Soup that livened our palates. The Greens Salad Fresh and drizzled with Subtle oil dressing. We all agreed was one of the best Salads of any Competition. Our Incredible Entrees ranged from Beef Wellington, Lamb Chops, Mushroom Crepes, Grilled Dear and Duck. All served as Ordered and to Perfection. Desert was Mousse Swisse and Creme Bulle which made us beg for MORE. The Selection of Wines and Cognac as recommended by Christine accompanying to a Royal Experience! We all Agreed the Cuisine was the Best so far in our Lifetime!"}
