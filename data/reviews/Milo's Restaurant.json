{"text":"I've eaten at many great...and not so great restaurants in the USA and europe.  Milo's can stand with any of the good ones.  It's food is honest, interesting and delicious-all without being pretentious.  The portion sizes are large (so it's really two meals), the prices are extremely reasonable and the place is casual.  I understand that the owner's also own a nearby bakery.  THAT explains their wonderful bread selection that you may nosh on while waiting for your meal.  The service has always been great, even when the place is packed, which is often."}
{"text":"The only time that I have eaten at Milo's I got food poisoning from the steak. The next day when I called to complain, the owner's son hung up on me. I highly recommend AGAINST eating at Milo's."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place and were sorely disappointed.  The decor is nice, the setting is relaxing.  It overlooks a small pond and has some outdoor seating.  However, the food and service are very mediocre.  Nothing special or memorable here at all.  Mediocre food would have even been ok if the prices reflected that.  Way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, definitely recommend it. Great service, great food. Maybe the only think I like the least is that they don't have cheesecake!! (hopefully they will read this comment)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband and mom and sister visiting from out of town.

As a starter I ordered the salad with a goat cheese strudel and herb vinaigrette. The dressing and strudel were excellent.  For dinner I ordered the crab cakes with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were good, but I was disappointed in the crab cake. I was hoping for jumbo lump, or at least lump crab, but it seemed to be all backfin. The seasoning was ok, but overpowered the sweet and brininess of the crab. My husband ordered the duck breast- which was very good, as was the rack of lamb with port reduction my mother ordered. Service was good, but plates were timed poorly- the potatoes and accompanying sauces (for the duck and lamb) were cold, indicating that the dishes weren't plated properly. All in all, a good meal, but not amazing.

Have since returned to Milo's for dinner. I ordered Chicken in Pesto Cream Sauce over Penne, my husband ordered the Crusted Tilapia w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Side Veg. For starters we had salad and a salmon chowder. The chicken was very well cooked, but it was breaded and fried, which I think should have been mentioned on the menu- unless it's chicken parmesan, I assume chicken with pasta (esp w/ a cream sauce) will be grilled/sauteed. The flavor of the sauce was *excellent*- but the penne was overcooked. My husband's fish was well prepared, but he felt the batter was a bit on the bland side. It also did not look like Tilapia- it was a thick piece of fish, with big flakes, so I would have guessed it was cod, pollock, or hake- tilapia are thin fillets. The mashed potatoes weren't exceptional, but for a side, they were decent. The salmon chowder- more like a corn chowder with a BIT of salmon, was good, but not the best I've had. Again, our meal was very good, and certainly by C-U standards, great.... but I still wouldn't say the meal was exceptional."}
{"text":"We dined at Milo's again last night.  Again it was because we were celebrating something positive in our lives, and again, we made the RIGHT choice.
This time, I finally persuaded myself to try something besides the reliably awesome filet - and went instead for the stuffed Salmon.  It was delicious!  subtle creamy exquisite flavors (without cream I think).  And I love that I can get my Caesar Salad with actual anchovies on top (and not just as ground up paste in the dressing).

The service is slightly slow sometimes, but there weren't a ton of staff on hand, so they're all doing a little extra.  It's hard to balance the staff numbers --  When we arrived, there were only about 2 other tables, but folks came in while we ate, and the service slowed down accordingly.  However, the service was always gracious, and courteous. 

My husband had one of the upside down pizzas.  I'm a convert -- it was awesome!  who knew?  How and why have I deprived myself for so very long.
We finished up with the flourless chocolate cake.  It just does NOT get better than that.

I WILL be back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in town for an event and wanted to go out for a nice dinner. Sadly, this place was a disappointment, and at least we had one another as company to make a crummy restaurant fun. 

I will start with the absolute worst thing about this place...... THE SERVICE!! Seriously, who is in charge of hiring here? They really need to rethink their whole staff. I would seriously equate the service of this place to that of a Pizza Hut. The waiter took zero interest in us. I asked him if the risotto was vegetarian or if it was made with chicken stock... to which he literally said \"Well, there is no meat in it and it comes with vegetables, so it is vegetarian.\" Sorry, this does not make it vegetarian. He did not even offer to go and ask the chef like any good waiter or waitress would do. Needless to say, I did not trust him and went with the mushroom ravioli instead. Looking back, I actually wish we were the type of people who could have not tipped at all, that is how bad it was. 

Moving on, the food. Overall, the quality of the food was very meh. As I said, I got the mushroom ravioli, and my fiancé got the Berkshire pork chop wrapped in pepper bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were a joke. Literally, I would prefer the onion rings from Portilo's any day. I mean, I would even take Burger King onion rings over these. The ravioli was fine, definitely nothing special. This place seems to think it is way fancier than it actually is. My ravioli came out with carrots and green beans on top.... just because you make your food look \"fancy\" does not mean it is good quality. In fact, my extra dressings were luke warm, and I had to remove them from the dish because it completely threw off the flavor. I tried the gralic mashed potatoes, and they were also fine, probably the same quality you would get a buffet. I absolutely did not feel as though the quality of the food lived up to either the descriptions on the menu, nor was it worth the prices they were charging. I think we ended up paying $50 for everything here, when in reality, it should have been much less based on the quality. 

The decor is very eclectic. Definitely nothing special and it just felt like we were sitting down at a chain restaurant. 

Nothing about this place really seems to match up. They are really trying to be something that they are not. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are looking for a nice evening."}
{"text":"We always have trouble finding a place to eat Sunday morning.  Places tend to be crowded.  So I was excited to learn Milos serves breakfast Sunday morning.  Sadly breakfast was lackluster at best and very under seasoned...not a good thing with eggs.  The smoked salmon and bagels consisted of one small bagel and four small pieces of salmon for $10.  When we asked about it, we were told that \"It's an expensive item.\"  Really??  Service was attentive but food came out slowly.  Sadly, our breakfast search will have to continue."}
{"text":"One of the pricier places I have eaten. The flavors were quite good, but the pork chop was a touch tough. Service is better at a drive up. Only one of three tables at the time, I had to ask for a water refill. I also had to listen to the manager and my waiter talk politics at the bar for ten minutes. Not a fine dining experience, just mediocre."}
{"text":"I had my bridal shower here; and although it's really cute inside, the menu doesn't offer a ton of options. Since it was a luncheon, my guests and I were given the choice of a chicken salad wrap and soup (either artichoke or split pea), or Soup and salad (mixed greens, or a salad w. goat cheese and rasp. vinaigrette). 

I confusingly ordered split pea soup and salad, not realizing that I wasn't specific enough about what kind of salad I wanted (the one with goat cheese). So instead I just got the mixed greens salad, which was kind of bitter and oily. The soup was very good, though- but it made me sick when I got home. :(

The hummingbird cake was the dessert, which looked very pretty but just wasn't my thing. I love carrot cake and banana bread, but this tasted like a strange combo of the two. Also, my Pepsi was flat, and they kept giving me refills to the point that it was annoying.

I hate giving them 2 stars, but just because your restaurant is cute and you have what looks to be an appealing menu doesn't mean it is."}
{"text":"It seems as tho I have hurt Amy W's feelings by writing a critique on a restaurant I like. How dare I?! How dare I have a *gasp* opinion?

Oh and Amy I do know about food. You go right on yelping dunkin donuts and red lobster--cause that's what *real* food is :eye roll:."}
{"text":"Their roasted red pepper and goat cheese strudel is the best salad I've ever had.  I don't know what they put in the dressing, but it is wonderful.  The items here are expensive, but the quality and service justifies the price.  A great place for lunch and they do a really good job with carryout as well."}
{"text":"Upside down bleu cheese, bacon & caramelized onions pizza was outstanding."}
{"text":"What a great little secret in Urbana.  I know that it is out of the way, though really Champaign Urbana is small so NOTHING is that out of the way, but I digress.  
I have been eating there for years, and I have always loved it.  I love the new, not really that new but newer, location.  Love that the outdoor seating is in the \"back yard\".  It's nice to look at a lake and not a parking lot.  
The food is always consistent and delicious.  It changes as the seasons do to include the freshest in season ingredients.  It is classic American, but it is more then that.  I have had a great steak, Duck cooked to perfection, great salad, and my personal favorite which is an upside down pizza with caramelized onions and bacon.  BACON BACON BACON.  Whoops.  Sorry.  I just LOVE bacon.  But I'll stop.
I also like that there is usually no wait to a shot wait at most.  If there is a wait they have a bar, or there is a great wine bar next door to have a glass while you wait!
I also know they do a lot of charity locally.  I like that they are involved.  
Make the 7 minute drive to windsor and philo.  You will be happy."}
{"text":"Wow.  I had an extremely negative experience here.  First of all, although there were only 3 tables of people in the entire restaurant, the waiter was \"too busy with the big table\" (which had 3 people at it) to wait on us, and the host came over instead.  He took our order and was moderately polite, and it came out relatively quickly, so that was OK.

The coffee was not good - very watery and bitter at the same time.  The appetizer wasn't fantastic, but my entree was atrocious.  The crusted tilapia was more of an oily breaded filet that tasted like it came out of a freezer bag.  The Spanish rice was sour and bland and parts of the rice didn't even have seasoning mixed in.  There were mushy boiled vegetables on top.  It came with \"aioli\" which turned out to be disgusting salad dressing.  My wife  Neither the host nor waiter came to check on us at all during the meal.  To top it off, I left feeling really queasy, probably from how greasy everything as - and we paid $40 for 2 people.  Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I understand that this restaurant might have been created with a traditional American cuisine in mind, but the flavor there is so much more unique than I normally find. I just wanted to give whoever created it credit for creating such a wonderful restaurant. I also made a couple type -os when writing this review. I ment that there were geese to watch while dinning. So sorry for any confusion my type-os caused.
 I also ment to refer to the restaurant as a Guatemalan/American Fusion. Because I liked the way the two flavors blended.  I thought that I was at a fusion restaurant. I have never tasted a fusion done so perfectly.
It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Our hostess Jane and her staff were cordial and attentive to our small group.  We were especially appreciative that there was accessible parking right outside and no steps in the entryway - important for us seasoned citizens!  The decor is attractive and the view to the lake is impressive.  The menu is sophisticated with a little something for everyone.  Wait staff was friendly and efficient, our food was delivered quickly and was as described - did I mention delicous.  A wonderful evening - accolades to all at Milo's."}
{"text":"Don't be tricked by the clean welcoming dining room. Food and service are both quite poor. I see no point in being too specific since every element we had was lackluster."}
{"text":"Milo's menu is short and sweet with many options to customize the meal to suit any taste or appetite. Every single entree looked good- it was difficult making a decision. The wild mushroom ravioli was mild and savory with a great cream sauce, and the perfect amount. The crab cake sandwich special was perfect in taste and texture. Everything that came to the table was perfect. I highly recommend Milo's."}
{"text":"The sisters who run this and the chef, Obdulio, are all very nice folks who run a restaurant that does what it does well.  That is to say, cater to those who want relatively conservative, mostly American-influenced cuisine plated nicely and with good portion size.  The space itself is pleasant enough, tucked in a corner of the now-decrepit Lincoln Square Mall.  Indeed, it is one of the few things left drawing people to that retail albatross.  Additionally, the place has been there for over 10 years, right around the time that several better quality restaurants started to assert themselves in the area.  So, they have a loyal clientele by now.  For food that is a little more adventurous by the same team, try Escobar's in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on Saturday evening.  I've been there before but wanted to go again to refresh myself before a review.  The place was relatively empty and we chose to sit outside on a beautiful night.  Service was good, but, then again, there weren't many customers.  We started with a brie in pastry.  It was quite good but the platter had more greens on it than anything else.  Would have preferred more of the brie.  One dish we had was the Duck Breast.  It was nicely cooked and the skin was just the right crispness.  The orange sauce was great,  accompanying vegetables were okay but the rice was bland.  We also had the Lamb, which was also nicely cooked.  The garlic potatoes were short on garlic, however.  The prices are a bit too high for what one gets.  It was, however, nice to sit outside."}
{"text":"Milo's was a bit of a letdown. I'd read the reviews on Yelp and was excited to check it out, but the food just did not deliver. I went there on a Saturday night with Arnab M: the place was pretty crowded but emptying as it was getting late, so we got a table right away. The food is American with various influences. I ordered one of the specials that day: duck breast with sauteed vegetables, mashed sweet potatoes and roasted pears (which by the way was almost identical to a dish I had at Escobar's in Champaign, see my review). I thought the duck was a little tough and overcooked, and the sides lacked flavor. Arnab had the Moroccan salmon: again the salmon was okay but the sides were disappointing. For the price (close to $20 per entree), I'm sure I can better dining options in town.

Btw, the place is kind of hard to find. It's on NE corner of the Lincoln Square Mall, and it took us a little while to find it."}
{"text":"Great food and is close to our house. It is definitely not a night/dinner/romantic date kind of place. Great for lunches or casual family dinners."}
{"text":"My experience was positive. The salad with bacon, pecans, feta, tomatoes was good, although not needed with the southwestern chicken egg rolls I ordered. The egg rolls had good salad greens and salsa with it.  Both of my friends ordered chicken salad in pineapple boats. Very creative, and I hear tastey. Good coffee as well. I paid $17.50 incl tax and a soft drink. The ages of people varied from 35-65. They have a small happy hour group. Nice environment. I saw people there I knew!"}
{"text":"My sisters and I had such a wonderful lunch at the Urbana location of Milo's this afternoon!  It was quite a busy lunchtime crowd, but we were seated quickly and were served warm rolls fresh from the oven while we looked over the menu.  I had the Southwest Chicken Eggrolls, which came with a small miixed green salad - a great lunch option.  The eggrolls were delicious, crispy, and the chicken filling was flavorful and creamy - not an overpowering southwest flavor, and the spicy sour cream added just the right amount of heat.  Jane's Chicken Salad and the Farmer's Salad were also big hits with my sisters at the table.  Staff was friendly and attentive, and the portions were generous.  We will definitely be back to try a few other menu items that sounded pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This place is WAY overpriced and the food reminds me of eating in a cafeteria.  The only bright spot to my meal was the coleslaw.  The decor is very eclectic to put it nicely but nothing that makes it stand out.  Service was ok but the server ignored me at first until I had to flag her down to ask to order a drink.  Not somewhere if ever eat again."}
{"text":"This farm to table restaurant serves wonderful, healthy foods. I had the eggplant entree and can hardly wait to order it again - so delicious! They also have a great wine list."}
{"text":"Meh. The food is ok, but the prices are WAY too high for the small portions you get. I would say that the food just slightly better than the stuff you get at McDonalds for about half the price. The chicken in the chicken sandwich I had was similar quality to the \"premium grilled chicken sandwich\" at McDonalds. I mean it is a real piece of chicken, but the meat just isn't that good. Although it is definitely better than the \"pink slime\" ground meat found in cheaper fast food, I would say the food is not nearly good enough to justify the high price. The portions were similarly disappointing too. My group and I were only provided 3 biscuits for the three of us. I would expect a basket for our group at a restaurant like this.

It seems like you are really paying for the fancy ambience more than the actual food at Milo's. I will have to admit that the restaurant is well decorated and clean, and the food is packaged quite well. They kind of want to trick you into believing the food is high end even when it is not.  I feel like Milo's is pretending to be a high end restaurant with high end decorations and prices, but they are missing the high end food expected at this price. Overall it is not that great of an experience at all, a two or maybe three star."}
{"text":"The upside-down pizza with blue cheese, bacon & caramelized onions is a fluffy bread bowl full of cheesy bacon-y goodness and onions, but it does not have tomato sauce.  It's delicious, but not really a pizza per se."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Milo's after hearing good things about it.  I must admit, I was a bit disappointed - that's why I only gave Milo's 2 stars.  I ordered the spinach salad and it was pretty good. Nothing special.  I also ordered the flat pizza with pesto, goat cheese, and sun dried tomatoes.  It was good, but a bit greasy.  My husband ordered the soup and I'm sorry I can't remember the name of it, but it was red and spicy - very good -probably the best of all we ordered.  I would definitely order it myself.  He also had their vegetarian lasagna.  It tasted like it was a Mexican lasagna and the flavors didn't seem to go together. My son had the salmon.  It was a small piece of salmon, but he said it tasted good.  He didn't eat the vegetables because they were loaded with sauce.  I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of ambiance.  I was expecting a really nicely decorated restaurant.  The tables and chairs look like they belong in Arby's.  There were no booths.  No privacy.  There were a lot of empty tables, yet we were seated right next to another couple.  We could hear most of their conversation.  I wasn't wowed by Milo's at all. Not sure if I'll go back any time soon."}
{"text":"On my search to find the best espresso,I came across Milos. 
This review is strictly for the espresso. It's smooth, sort of nutty, maybe eating chocolatey undertones.. no sugar or cream needed to enjoy.
Delivered in a perfectly lovely little cup as I sit on the patio that overlooks the water, this is a great way to start my day!"}
{"text":"This place used to be very good. Since it moved to its new location on Philo road, I think it has really gone down the tubes.
Several complaints I have are:
prices have gone WAY up
the new restaurant has no ambience, and the acoustics are terrible
the service was incredibly slow, it took over an hour just to get our entrees!
the food has become mediocre

It is really a disappointment because this used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town when it was in Lincoln Square Mall. But just about everything has taken a turn for the worst now."}
{"text":"I came here for a graduation dinner on the recommendation of a friend (who works here as a waitress so I took the rec with a grain of salt). I was pleasantly surprised. We got a window table with a great view of the water. The server was super friendly and on her rec I ordered the duck - which was delicious. It was cooked perfectly with the right trimmings. I wish I had discovered this place earlier, like before I moved out of Chambana...I recommend this place for a reasonable meal with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes.  The decor was a bit like a fancy Denny's.  However, while ordering I was pleased to hear that they made their Caesar dressing on site with raw egg and anchovy no less.  It was good.  However, my meal of Moroccan Spiked Salmon was disappointing.  It tasted very generic.  Yet, one of my co-diners had the Tilapia at it was great.  It is off the beaten path and I probably wouldn't make a special trip.  However, if you are there, enjoy your friends or family and have a nice meal."}
{"text":"Milo's offers some of the most bland, thoughtless food I have ever tasted. Their management is evasive and staff are flaky and rude. My worst Thanksgiving meal ever was at Milo's, last year (the last time we will ever be going back to Milo's or Escobar). And back at their Lincoln Square Mall location, I learned that just because you like goat cheese does not mean you put it on everything."}
{"text":"Wow--I will not be returning to this place.  

I have eaten lunch there on two previous occasions, and while the service wasn't exceptional it wasn't bad either.

I wish I could say the same about my first (and LAST!) dinner experience there!  Clearly the managerial staff does not do an appropriate job of training the servers.  Our poor server was clearly overwhelmed and just hadn't received much if any training.  He was a sweet and sincere young man--I will always forgive service errors for waits in this situation.  It isn't their fault if they have the desire to provide good service but are not provided with the proper tools by management.

About 25 minutes after we were served our appetizer, we still hadn't  been served our food.  We got the attention of the manager and told her of the excessive ticket time and also told her that she needed to provide more training to her staff (the poor kid actually approached every table and said \"you ok with just water?\" ) and she laughed.  I was serious.

A few minutes later our food was delivered (incorrectly--wrong pizza for my son and wrong steak temp for my hubby, but at this point we didn't bother to bring it to anyone's attention).  We had literally taken about two bites when the manager had the nerve to grab the poor server by the arm and physically drag him over to our table.  She instructed me to \"tell him what you just told me\" and she stood there holding his elbow like he was a bad kid.

I was incensed that she humiliated the poor kid in front of the whole restaurant and was aghast that she would put a guest in such a situation.  It is HER job to coach her staff, not the guest's.

We won't be back.  And in the hours since our visit last night, I've heard from numerous friends who have had tremendously bad service there also and swear to never return."}
{"text":"This place was all around a disappointment. From the moment we walked in the door, until we left, it was terrible.I was so excited to go there a eat a delicious steak. The service was pretty poor. First of all there were maybe 2 customers drinking at the bar and 3 tables of customers eating, in the entire place. We waited to be seated while three workers who were not busy stood there and looked at us. I guess it wasn't \"their job\". Once the host came out and seated us, the waiter came over and talked at us (instead of to us). He never introduced himself, didn't check on us regular, ask how our food was, clear our plates, or thank us. I asked for my $28 steak to be medium. It was well done and than some. Very dry. I would have sent it back, but our waiter didn't check back. My date wanted a soda with his food, but again the waiter never checked back. The tables and chairs looked like they were from a Chinese buffet, the plates looked like the multicolored ones from the mexican restaurant, they had Christmas and Valentine decorations up, Chinese lanterns, and one seashell windchime. It was very weird and cheap cheap cheap looking! I'm not sure what we paided $75+ for. It definitely wasn't the service, setting, or food. We will NEVER go back again."}
{"text":"My dad and I were very impressed with the new Milo's in Urbana.  They got us in on a Friday night without reservations, and even though it got really busy as the night progressed, our waiter never hinted at needing the table, etc.  He was very friendly, knowledgeable, and there without being overbearing.  He was prompt with beverage refills as well, and had someone check in on our table when he was on break.

We shared a crabcake appetizer, which was absolutely delicious.  They came out still quite hot, and the outside was very crisp while maintaining a softer inside.  The aioli on the side was great, and the plating very nice.  We both had the salmon with winter vegetable puree for dinner.  My dad and I are both seafood snobs, and the salmon was actually better than what we got on the east coast in October of last year.

It is a little pricey, but the ambiance, friendly staff and excellent food make up for it.  That being said... I go there when the parents are treating, not when I have to pay for myself."}
{"text":"Pretty much a non-Latin Escobars. (Same owners). Nice selection and good service. The burger I had wasn't as good as I would have expected for the price and class of restuarant. The other entrees looked pretty good and they didn't poopoo my toddler like I rather expected.  But again, with the elf food.  I want to be full when I leave."}
{"text":"I just went to Milo's for the second time this week both times were exceptional. this time it was for breakfast I had the carb less scramble which they made to order and it was perfect my mother-in-law had the eggs Benedict and my wife at the quiche which were both outstanding the staff there are top-of-the-line, really great wonderful folk. I'm certain you will have a similar experience"}
{"text":"Just got back from Milo's.  This is a small cozy place with a real local feel.  The service was excellent.  The food was quite good.  I got a Cuban black bean and ham soup followed by a broiled salmon on rice with vegetables and mango.  It was a quiet and homey place good for a conversation.  Also, tonight (Wednesday) there were a lot of old women there.. which made it kind of cute =p.

The location is really quite strange.  While it is connected to the Lincoln Square Mall, the entrance is on outside (specifically the East side) of the mall.  And wow I have to say that Mall is straaange to walk through.. nearly abandoned and oh so ugly."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Eclectic. The space is open, with tables lined up against the walls, and local artists portraits on the walls. It seems \"airy\" in the dining room, with enough windows and space to feel like you aren't crushed by a dinner rush. I rather enjoyed sitting by the window looking out at the pond in the back, though I found myself having to strain to do so because the windows are higher than the chairs. The one thing I will also note is the noise level. For some reason, although I didn't notice it really loud in the restaurant, we were unable to hear each other across a round table. It was really odd, and I can't say I've ever experienced it dining before. We had to strain to hear one another, maybe the table was too big, or sounds bounced off the walls causing an unecessary reverberation, but whatever it is it was unsettling, and made enjoying each other's company nearly impossible.

FOOD: Fair. I had the springtime risotto with chicken, and while the flavors of the risotto were pretty good (me being a risotto snob), I was dissapointed when it came to the table. I ordered a RISOTTO dish (with a side of chicken, which I expected to be sliced over the top) - what I got was about 1/2 cup of risotto, and a whole char-broiled chicken breast squashing my risotto. I also got a random smattering of carrots and green beans that I didn't order and shouldn't have been included, given the veg in my dish. The risotto, while decently flavored, was slightly under. 

My children each had the kid's pizza, and these were really good, actually.They were hand made, nice crusts, good cheese to sauce ratio, and pleasantly flavored, not like the usual frozen tasteless slop that many other restaurants usually send out for kids. It made me happy to see that the chef was thoughtful about younger patrons, and I'd probably return based on that alone.

SERVICE: Meh... our server was an older female with long white hair that she didn't pull back, leaving me to wonder how much of it got into the food on any given night. She was slow to take our order, and I felt like slow to bring the food, but otherwise pleasant enough, and did a good job of keeping up with water and drinks.

VALUE: Fair enough. Again, I felt like the risotto was overpriced some given the portion size, but a little portioning could fix this. Expect to pay around $20 per plate for adults, and most everything else I saw looked fresh, nicely made, and probably worth it."}
{"text":"We had been to Milo's at the old location and had some very good meals there. I loved the hummingbird cake. The food was special.  Something must have happened when Milo's moved to its new location. We decided the year it moved to go for Thanksgiving dinner, which was our first time there. We had the worst holiday meal experience of our lives. Our reservation was not honored in a timely way. The kitchen was over an hour behind. A waitress told us the owner had been letting in people without reservations, trying to capture all the business possible. Since we had nowhere else to go, we stayed. The food was really underwhelming, just above cafeteria grade, from the turkey to the dessert -- which was too bad, since it was a set, limited option menu, which should have given the kitchen enough focus to do things well. Our family was very let down by the experience. We have never gone back."}
{"text":"The food is ok. But for the prices it should be much better. Some people really love this place, but I just don't understand their excitement. The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxing."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I love the local artwork on the walls, the complimentary basket of unique, delicious MUFFINS delivered right to your table.  And the very well prepared, gourmet items on the menu.  The salads are perfection.  I have been here many times for lunch with co-workers and have yet to be disappointed.  My only issue is the weirdness they have with credit/debit cards....they will take them, but only 1 person per table when its separate checks.  So if you're planning on separate checks, bring cash."}
{"text":"David S. wanted to try out Milo's since Champaign doesn't have a million places to try, and Milo's had good reviews. We got a little lost trying to find it because the entrance is sort of hidden on the eastern side of Lincoln Square, but on our way we discovered some sort of teenage rave in the works, sooo random... We even directed someone to it. WEIRD and laughable doesn't begin to describe the situation. I ordered the Moroccan/Israeli spicy salmon with couscous which wasn't bad but came with this gigantic couscous, almost like tapioca pearls. It wasn't bad at all, but David's duck special was mediocre at best. David ordered some red wine, I forget which one but it was pretty good. Their waitstaff are all really niceee, mainly older men, which I'm so not used to. That's middle America for you, eh?"}
{"text":"This place was such a let-down after seeing such good reviews. Maybe I went on a bad night? I'm not sure but the food was bland and not very appetizing, with not a very extensive menu of options. The service was slow, and overall just nothing to rave about. I don't plan to return, there are better options."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the food we had here. It was very adequate in presentation and taste for the most part. The service was great, very attentive without being overbearing, kudos to that guy. Now I'm a guy in my mid thirties, my wife and I were out celebrating our anniversary and had always thought about going there but never did so I figured we'd finally do it to mark our special day. We had reservations but they were not necessary as the restaurant was maybe half to two-thirds full when we got there-anyway we were greeted and taken to our table right away (This was at 6:30 mind you). Our waited appeared, told us the specials, got our drinks ( I had a beer and my wife a sangria) and we took a look at the menu. While I admit I don't have the most cultured palette, I felt like this restaurant didn't know what it wanted to be. One the menu there are several seafood dishes, Mac and cheese (Which I have nothing against but it didn't fit with everything else), Pizza, and the lovely \"Milo's Favorites\" column which included Chicken Salad, a Cheeseburger, Country Fried Steak, and Pasta Primavera. The Entrees were all over the place as well. Two steak, one pork, 3 Seafood, a couple of pasta- All if them having their individual road to go down-Moroccan, Cajun, Italian, etc. My wife had the pan roasted chicken with thai curry sauce, jasmine rice, and seasonal vegetables. She it was good, but not outstanding. I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and season vegetables. I have a feeling this place does not a have a grill. Maybe it's just me, but if I have the opportunity to grill and size-able piece of meat, I'm going to. I feel like that lends itself to a lot of flavor. The chop was plenty juicy and I believe was pan seared and then finished off in the oven. It was topped with some sort of apple mixture. While it wasn't bad, I felt like it needed salt and overall more flavor. The potatoes were very good as were the vegetables. I guess the thing that bothered me the most was that I felt like I was eating at a hospital cafeteria (albeit a nice one). I certainly wouldn't classify this place as romantic as there is no place secluded in the restaurant. It's a big open room with some very plan looking tables and chairs. If anything I think I would put linen table cloths on for dinner and some wine glasses. Maybe build some booths or partitions...something. They have a very nice looking pond in the back, there's tons of potential, it's just as if the owner got to doing the dining room and  ran out of money; bare minimum. The clientele was fine, however I'm guessing the average age of folks there was 65 on a Saturday night and when we departed around 7:30 there hadn't been anyone come in for the past 20 minutes or so. If I were the restaurant owner I might be a tad concerned. I certainly believe this place is a decent place to eat but atmosphere is lacking."}
{"text":"Best brunch experience I've had in CU in a very long time. Service was friendly and fast without being rushed, and the food was delicious. Our Benedict's came with fried potatoes with a homemade sauce, fresh fruit, and a superb hollandaise. Everything was perfect down to the poached eggs. Beautiful view of a pond while we ate as well. This was our first time visiting, and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lincoln Square Mall is dead but this place isn't.  The place is small but has a cozy feel.  Service is fairly nice.  Lots of good things on the menu: lamb, steak, upside-down pizzas, etc.  Dessert menu is fairly standard but they do have an assortment of teas served in single French presses.  Price is good, too."}
{"text":"This is a really charming place. I went for lunch and ordered the grilled salmon with pesto. It was very good but I could have eaten another order. For those of you that hate coconut, like myself, the chocolate chip muffins that they bring out is loaded with coconut. Nice ambience and a nice view."}
{"text":"We had brunch here and it was just ok.  I had the Florentine Eggs Benedict.   It was tasty but the poached eggs were too well done (yolk not runny enough).  The Hollandaise was not seasoned enough.  Bacon was burnt.  Split pea soup was interesting but ultimately not very satisfying."}
{"text":"Came for a business lunch and was very pleased. Had a grilled chicken sandwich with cheese and bacon and avacado. Delicious!! Everything that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing! The biscuits that they had on table looked great and smelled wonderful and where gone in an instant! I will come back when I return!!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Milo's on a Monday night. We were a party of 5 eating at 6pm. The restaurant was fairly empty besides a couple of other tables.

The bread was phenomenal. The one that looks like a muffin is freshly baked and has a hint of coconut. They are generous with the bread serving and the butter is soft and perfectly spreadable. 

For my entree, I ordered the goat cheese and roasted pepper strudel salad. I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the strudel, but it was amazing. The salad itself was fresh and light with perfect amount of dressing. On the side you have a puff pastry which encompasses goat cheese and the roasted peppers; note there is no goat cheese or peppers in the salad itself which is what I thought it would be. It was a pleasant surprise. I do wish there were a little more peppers and maybe a grilled onion.

To drink I ordered the house cabernet red wine. It was a solid choice. I was impressed with the craft beer selection, however. From dogfish head to beers I had never heard of before, I would easily go back just for the unique selection.

For dessert we shared an apple crisp between the 5 of us.

Each of us ordered a drink, a meal (one was even the pork special), and shared the desert- the bill averaged to $20/person. After reading some other reviews, there may have been chaotic experiences, but I had one of the most satisfying group friendly experiences ever. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We visited this establishment for the first time in the middle of a Saturday afternoon.  There were 2 other groups of people there as well.
After we were seated, the waitress walked up to us and spouted off the specials.  No 'Welcome!', no 'my name is...'.  
They brought out a basket of some kind of muffin/bread.  I took one bite and gagged as it tasted like some sort of chemical.  I let this slide as it could have just been my taste buds.
The Asian Beef soup was actually pretty good.
The gentleman refilling water glasses didn't think to stop by our table (neither did the waitress) for the duration of the meal.
I had a grilled salmon sandwich.  The salmon portion was TINY!  It was $12 for about $3 worth of salmon.  It was also very fishy, not like the salmon I'm used to.
My guest had a burger.  It was COVERED in grease... bun and all.  The tomato was mealy and the burger didn't taste like it had been seasoned in any way. 
The sweet potato fries we decent but barely warm.
Each meal was to come with a side of broccoli slaw, they came with a small salad (and some unknown 'dressing' on the side) instead.  When I asked the waitress if they ran out, she went to the back to find out.  She came back and said they apparently got a bad shipment of broccoli that morning.  They are right across from a grocery store!  They never mentioned they would be substituting anything and didn't offer us a choice. 

Overall, this place is VERY overpriced for such terrible service and lackluster food.  Did I mention they have a $9 grilled cheese sandwich?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is going on here at Milo's lately, but....  it appears to have become a senior citizen hangout in the last 6 months or so.  I went for Valentine's Day (again) this year and I noticed that there were quite a few seniors here.  Big deal.  Then I went there for Sunday brunch last weekend, and I swear to you, I was the youngest person in the packed place by a good 50 years.  What has happened? Since when do senior citizens like to eat weird/fancy/crazy food?  I thought older people liked boring food haha. Maybe I'm the one who needs to get with the times =)"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, great service and nice atmosphere for a quiet dinner, good variety on menu-one of my top 10 in Chambana"}
{"text":"I will start my review off by admitting that when my girlfriend and I walked in here for dinner we probably took the average age in Milo's down by 35 years. But honestly, WHO CARES?!?!

The food is good. The prices are very reasonable, the quality is high, and it tastes good. Milo's is not as interesting as Escobar's, among C-U's \"nice\" restaurants, it's probably not the most interesting of any of them. It kind of reminds me of a restaurant in a hotel in Florida, which SURPRISE  would probably feature a weird mix of Southern, Asian, Italian and Mediterranean, served in a comfy, relaxed environment to a fairly senior crowd.

Whatever. Come, eat, enjoy- knocking off stars cause it's got a lot of elderly guests is just silly.

Last thing I'll say is get the lemonade. I know that's random, but I can't begin to articulate how good their lemonade is."}
{"text":"Their seasonal menu is all your typical continental stuff:  lamb, steak, duck... they're all good, but not blow your mind this is the best ever good.  Another thing is that they don't seem tend to have a professional wait staff, sometimes making the service a little shoddy on some visits.  However, I think this place is a lot better than other \"fancier\" places like Kennedy's or Silver Creek.

What really makes this place shine are their specials.  They prove that Milo's will explore different varieties of food, such as Thai with a seared tuna in a (I forget what kind) curry sauce or Cajun with corn meal fried soft shell crab over jambalaya.  Every so often you'll see a recurring special (seared tuna with *blank* sauce), depending on what season it is.  The problem is that their specials are sometimes hit or miss, but the fact that they try so many different things is refreshing.

This place is definitely a must try in Champaign-Urbana.

Some general things to look for in their menu:  So after a while you'll notice that they tend to have some things prepared just a bit differently, but involve some of the same basic cooking techniques.  So despite the fact that you may not  see the exact same dish on subsequent visits, you can always count on certain things having the same solid quality:

Rack of Lamb:  Pretty good and tasty.  However it is a bit on the chewy side.

Steaks:  Whether it's a filet, ribeye, or strip, they come nicely charbroiled.  This is a good bet if you're a fan of steaks.

Seared tuna :  Regardless of what sauce they serve this in, if they're serving seared tuna?  GET IT.

Pan seared scallops:  They have these down to a science.  Always delicious.

A specific type of pizza... mushroom Duxelle Upside Down Pizza:  This is just awesome.  If you're lucky enough to see it on the menu, give it a try."}
{"text":"Milo's is a simple restaurant that is good at solid, family food--not trying to be fancy. There's something for everyone on the menu and the food has improved dramatically since my last visit. I had the tequila lime shrimp which was very tasty. I also heard good things about the upside down pizzas. Again, it's not fine dining, but it's simple food done well."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday/Christmas lunch. It wasn't packed. I had the salmon on French bread with pesto. Honestly, I could have made it better myself. The other three in my party had the hamburgers. No one complained about that. They had given us free muffins while we waited, and that was excellent. The fries were good and the homemade ketchup was alright. 
The broccolli slaw as a side was excellent. I wish there were more of it on the plate. 
I noticed they also do special dinners. Like a Christmas dinner and a New years eve dinner. 
The price of the meal for four was around $55 with tip. 
The menu didn't have many options. The decor was medicore. The tables were small. 
The place would be nice to go to on special occasions or on a date, but I wouldn't eat lunch there often."}
{"text":"We took a long walk with the dogweasel over to Milo's and had dinner there last night (Wednesday) and got a great meal at a reasonable(ish) price. I had the salad with the corn/bean topping, beets, tomatoes, pecorino cheese and mixed greens which was huge and very good. The dressing compliments this salad very well. The lady had a daily special cold yogurt peach soup which she enjoyed a lot, but which is not for everybody, including me. The complimentary bread was very good and featured a couple of different kinds, all good.

For entrees, we had their Thai curry flavored Halibut (on special) and chicken, which came with rice and sauteed vegetables. They were both expertly cooked, pleasingly presented, and amply portioned. The tasty curry sauce was similar to a slightly spicy Panang, but was reduced to a perfect consistency for the dishes.  We both had leftovers. 

Their outdoor patio is really nice and looks over a pond and prairie area (that will soon be development, so enjoy the view while it lasts). The decor inside is also nice with original local artwork on the walls.

The folks there were really nice and service could not be better. They let us bring our dog and gave us no jazz when she was less than perfectly behaved. They have a very nice wine list which, although not that large, has some very good choices at eminently reasonable prices. The selection of wines by the glass is superior. They also have a good beer selection, including Krusovice, which is fast becoming a new fave of mine. All told, the bill was in the high $50s pretax, which is not stellar, but about right for Chambana."}
{"text":"Gumbo soup was very good and not heavy, Duck w/vegetables were good, salads are excellent, filet mignon was perfect. Fast service and friendly."}
{"text":"So this place is one of those faux fancy restaurant places. As in, the dress code is casual, but the menu is portrayed as a high end restaurant with prices that are higher than chains, but lower than high end restaurants. My wild mushroom ravioli was definitely tasty, but quite expensive. My friend's fish & chips entree had way more chips than fish."}
{"text":"I like Milo's. The good: Nice ambiance. The food is tasty. I especially enjoy the flat pizza with smoked salmon. Hot dang, it's good. 

The ok: The prices here are a tad high. The food could be even better. 

To sum up: they have some growing edges, but you'll have a good meal in a happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and was the only person there under 65. I had the mushroom ravioli, which had some completely random cooked carrots on top.  I only had 6 ravioli, I guess because it was lunch. The food was fair, the prices were average. The decor was unremarkable. It does look out onto a pond which was nice. I looked at the dinner menu and the prices seemed a little high to me, based on how how the lunch went? I probably would not come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious.

I chose this restaurant for my graduation dinner because I had heard wonderful things about it in the past. We called and made a reservation, and I was very excited.

First strike: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8 people at 6:30 PM. I called several minutes ahead of time as a courtesy to let them know we would be arriving shortly (because it was a Friday night and I wanted to know if they were on schedule). I reiterated our number of guests and the time. When we arrived, our table was set up for the wrong number of people, and the table they chose was completely impractical for the special needs of some of our guests (which were divulged over the phone both times). There were 5 other tables dining in the restaurant. FIVE. There was no reason, especially after my phone call, that this should have happened. We waited around for changes to be made, which took longer than it should have. However, since we're all human, I shrugged it off and got ready for my meal.

Second strike: We ordered drinks, and I can safely say they were the worst drinks we've ever had. Not one person at our table enjoyed their cocktail; they were overpriced, contained almost no liquor, and were improperly mixed. We stuck to (very overpriced) beer for the rest of the night.

Third strike: When it came time to order dinner, we asked the waiter about some of the items on the menu. He seemed to know what 3 of the dishes were, and when we asked him some opinion questions, it became obvious that he only told us to pick these dishes because he was able to pronounce their names. He had NO clue what he was talking about, and we decided to take our chances by ordering a variety of dishes. I also ordered the shrimp cake appetizer.

Fourth strike: I waited for said appetizer for 40 minutes. In that time two more tables arrived, but three left. Our waiter did not offer refills or check on our table while we waited, and by the time my appetizer showed up, I was about to start eating the basket the bread arrived in. They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?

Fifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.

Between the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed. The amount we paid for this awful meal makes it twice as bad. I will definitely never be back to this restaurant. The fact that there were less than 10 occupied tables at what would normally be the dinner rush on a Friday night speaks volumes, and now I know why."}
{"text":"Milo's is an unassuming little restaurant tucked in Urbana east side (I believe almost what you'd call Philo). I made a reservation because of homecoming and was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't really necessary. The location has ample parking and the dining area is open and well lit. They have a full bar and a few things on the \"American style\" menu including salad, pizza, and lasagna. It's an eclectic offering, almost to the point that I couldn't make a decision. I ordered the Punch with Bacardi Razz and pineapple. It was a great combination of sweet lemonade and a hint of tropical flavor. After several consultations with our very patient waiter, he literally tried to take our order 3 times but our indecision stopped progress, my friend and I decided to split the panko crusted chicken. The waiter then informed us that we would be charged $4 to split the plate as they gave us more noodles. I'm not one to put up a fight but upon reflection I don't think this is a good way to handle a consumer's request. The extra noodles should be an option and should not be $4 anyway. I mean, I could have split it myself for free. The panko crusted chicken was tasty, with a side of broccoli and green beans. For $15 ($19 if you split the plate), it was a great value and tasted pretty good. Overall the venue, service, and food were very good. I want to give it four stars but it just isn't on par with restaurants of that caliber. To me, it was just a pretty good local spot."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere but the service is awful! All three times I've been there I have had a terrible experience due to my server. I was there this past Sunday for my birthday and decided to have breakfast. My sever (Fleurette I think was her name) came up to me with this glare on her face and I ordered a mimosa and she just glared at me and asked for my I.D. then proceeded to ask us if we were ready to order, We had JUST sat down...then when she came back to take the order I told her what I wanted and she just glared at me and walked away! I asked my friend \"Does she have a problem with me or what?\" Then another server brought us our food and even came back to check on us. She was too busy with her ONE other table and I watched her kiss the other tables ass. Then she brought us the bill without asking if we wanted refills on our mimosas or clearing the table of our empty dishes. Clearly she didn't want us there. Then after we had paid the bill she came back to the table and picked up her tip while we were STILL sitting there!! Who does that?! Clearly she doesn't know much about working at a restaurant. I have worked at a fine dinning restaurant in downtown Champaign for almost three years and this would never happen there. They really need to rethink their hiring process and actually hire some people with manners and personalities! I gave it three tries but after this last experience I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend , ordered the Ruben sandwich plate , the sandwich was great but everything else was unbeatable , the fries were limp and greasy only taste they had was grease, the Slaw had no flavor it lacked seasoning."}
{"text":"Milo's was one place on my list of restaurants that I wanted to visit before I left the C-U area. I went on a Wednesday night with five friends without a reservation, and we definitely didn't need one - the restaurant was almost empty and we were seated quickly at a table. We were brought a basket of bread which had an assortment of breads and muffins, and our table requested more muffins as they were DELICIOUS. After hearing about their specialty upside-down pizzas, I wanted to try one and shared the caramelized onion, blue cheese and bacon (ordered and correctly served without bacon) pizza and the mushroom ravioli with a friend. Both were delicious, and the ravioli was served with fresh steamed summer vegetables on top which was a nice surprise. My starter of a mixed greens salad with basil vinaigrette was perfect. The service was good and none of our water glasses were left empty. The only drawback would be that their menu doesn't have the biggest selection, but everyone I went with was able to find something to eat and enjoy it. Also, they have strange policies about no more than two credit cards per table and a fee for splitting plates. Overall, I'm glad I was able to visit this restaurant, and the drive over to its location was worth it."}
{"text":"1st time there on a recommendation;  menu provided a lot of choices and appears to easily change; seating surrounds a full bar with a upscale romantic feel.  We'll be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"My parents were in town and wanted to treat me and my friend to a nice dinner, so we went to Milo's for dinner.  It's located in this cute little building kinda out in the middle of an empty field, but everything inside the building is really nicely done.  There're lots of bright paintings hung on the walls, and generally gives off the ambiance of a really nice sit-down dinner place where you can chat with friends over wine or bring a date.
Servers were all very nice and prompt, and the portions were HUGE!  I had their tilapia ($17), and they served one of the biggest pieces of fish I have ever seen.  My dad ordered their pork porterhouse and also got a huge slab of meat.  My mom's salmon and my friend's mushroom ravioli were a bit more normal sized.  As for quality, everything was delicious.  The tilapia was lemony, buttered, and breaded, and the fish was thin enough for all the flavoring to soak in but not thin enough to be anywhere near insubstantial.  The vegetable risotto that accompanied it was delicious as well.  Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food as well, though my father's hoisin porterhouse had a bit too much hoisin sauce slathered onto it, which made it saltier than it could have been.
Overall, a very satisfying dinner for reasonable prices (probably an average $20 per entree).  4 stars for solid comfort food that's done well in a very nice setting.  On a more random note, we noticed (or maybe this is just on Thursday nights...or maybe just that particular Thursday night) that the clientele consisted pretty much entirely of older Caucasian women, who would cast a couple of curious, innocuous glances our way throughout the evening (everyone in our party was Asian).  We didn't mind though; my parents joked that maybe they thought we were celebrities =P"}
{"text":"Five stars for my second to last visit here, three stars for my latest...

I took my parents here about a year ago for dinner, and we had a great time. My mom loved her salad with 'strudel' on top, my dad had a steak, and I had the famous upside down pizza. (It's cooked upside down, then brought to the table and flipped over on your plate.) We also love love loved the smoked salmon and goat cheese bruschetta, so don't skip it!

My latest trip was for brunch, where my mom and I split the spinach salad with strawberries and goat cheese and the grilled salmon pesto sandwich. The sandwich was fantastic, but the piece of salmon was very small. The salad was pretty good too, but priced like a dinner salad and sized like a side. 

The real differences in our experience were from the fact that the waitress kept forgetting things, from my brother's lemonade to an extra plate so we could share our food. However, even though we had to keep reminding her of these things, she was in remarkably good spirits the whole time and seemed genuinely apologetic for forgetting our requests."}
{"text":"The five times I've been here for lunch the fresh and flavor of the food exceeds my expectations. Servers are friendly, pre-meal bread is always unique and good."}
{"text":"This place is situated in such a calm and elegant location! The indoor setting is very nicely arranged and the outdoor seating had a lovely field and pond to look out into. The service was quick (at times a little questionable...)  but nonetheless, allowed us to have a great experience. I ordered the upside down pizza with caramelized onions, bacon and blue cheese. Absolutely delicious and flavorful! The presentation was very beautiful when flipped over at our table! A friend had ordered something that is typically from the lunch menu and there was no problem making that exception for her. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
It finally happened, I found a restaurant that lost all of the stars as I slowly went through my meal. I really should have read the negative reviews and let me tell you my experience.
5 stars: Dinner out on a Friday night with a restaurant with plenty of parking
4 stars: Interesting decor, it has a nice classic upscale restaurant feel but the random section blocked off for video game poker, the random light fixtures, and the mall food court tables sort of conflict with the feel of the restaurant
3 stars: Menu items are expensive and not very exciting or imaginative. 10 dollar for a shrimp cake appetizer that was basically 3 balls of fried dough with shrimp and a side salad. 18 dollars for braised beef with mash potatoes. Very salty and oily. The food itself was not spectacular, but very pedestrian. 
2 stars: I'll ignore the fact that the servers hand was dipped into the gravy of my dish because it tipped to the side, but our waiter only came to take our order and give us the receipt. Not once did he stop by to say how was the meal, not once did he refill my empty glass until I asked him to when he gave me the check, not once did he even say thank you for coming
1 star: In summary after dinner I felt that I could have done a lot better for dinner tonight. You can make up your mind, but if I am paying 50+ dollars for dinner I expect something better or even have better service. It almost felt like we were strangers walking in and out....

Pros: None

Cons: Poor customer service, very salty food, way overpriced

Hidden deals:
Early bird special for 12 dollars, soup or salad and a selection from 3 entree. Mon thru thursday 5-6 pm

Health code rating: C. The finger that touched by gravy when bringing out my dish did not help. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1220"}
