{"text":"Went to hang out with some friends Saturday night. Got there around 10 or so. Was not busy, got seated quickly. However, service here is lacking greatly (as it was when the place was called Cleopatras) and is VERY SLOWWWWW. Waited 23 minutes for a cranberry/vodka and over an hour for food/hookah. I don't think I even tasted vodka in my cran/vodka. I didn't feel like complaining since I knew it would take forever to get another one. The hummus with meat was decent, bread was kinda dry and hard. Don't expect too much when you come. It's too bad Bc this place has the potential to be so great! Maybe they need better management."}
{"text":"Zad Al Khair is one of those restaurants that has high potential, but struggles by cutting corners and irresponsible management. 

First impressions is that Zad Al Khair is a wonderful open restaurant, perfect for entertainment, and probably provides a great nightlife. Our party (12 people) had prior reservations, but upon arrival, the staff was not prepared for us despite the restaurant being empty. We ordered a wide variety of appetizers to start off. Once the appetizers arrived, the hummus was dried (as though it was sitting out for a couple hours), and the lettuce in the fattosh was blackened on the corners. The tabouli was bland, the fresh fries were nothing special, but the baba ghanoush was actually quite good. We requested the humus be switched for a new plate, in which, when fresh, the humus is not bad. 

We all ordered separate plates, mostly consisting of the mixed meat platter. After 30 minutes, 6 plates arrived, consisting of mixed meat platter, falafel, and lamb shanks. Our party waited for the other 6 dishes for the remaining people in the party for nearly 45 minutes before we approached the staff. They stated they did not have the orders in, but if we put them in at that time it would take another 30 minutes. We declined that offer. They did not take responsibility for their mistake, but instead blamed the \"lack of staff available to accommodate\" for our \"large\" 12 person party. They stated that they were not prepared for our arrival, although we reserved in advance. We ended up paying the check and walking out. Their irresponsibility cost us valuable time. There are plenty of better authentic middle eastern food nearby such as Khyber Halal, Persian Room, or Ali Baba. Save your time and money and head to one of those places. 

About the orders we actually received, in summary; the falafel was greatly overcooked (blackened) and was left uneaten due to the flavor of the burns, the mixed meat platter was all cooked at well done to burnt (no real flavor or excitement), and the lamb shanks were average at best. It's disappointing that such a restaurant with the size and atmosphere it has, produces food that is clearly done by a lack of effort. Save yourself and head someplace else, at least until they make a conscience effort to change their motives and responsibilities."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Very reasonable price, and friendly service. We plan on coming back often."}
{"text":"First time here. Food is amazing. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Very welcoming environment! Recommend for everyone to come and try this place out if you live in the area you will definitely not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Love this place. The new chef is amazing - great middle eastern food, great Hooka, very nice patio area. The place is beautiful inside. The waiters are very friendly and polite. Will definitely go back. Go judge for yourself."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  First off after being seated, the older lady brings out 3 bottles of 16.9 oz of Costco water and puts one in front of the 3 of us.  She took our order and ask what we wanted to drink.  We said,  water.   We thought the restaurant did not have any water and that was the reason they served bottled water.  The food was ok.   We went to pay and we were shocked to see a charged $1.50 per bottle water = $4.50 for the water.  This restaurant is getting over $56.00 on every.        $ 2.99 case of 40 in a container of Costco water.  This is just not right.  I will go back to eat here again.   The old lady did not tell us this when she served the water along with our menus.   Don't go there....Rip off city...Food is  just OK....        Why are they ripping customers off with Costco bottled water?  It is about .10 a bottle including tax from Costco so what is the mark to $ 1.50 ,  with tax $1.64, a lot.  You just lost my business by being sneaky and dishonest."}
{"text":"Food is average but music sound on Saturday night is literally ear damaging. Waiter said volume cannot go down. Service is ok though.
Also once we entered, they told us we must spend at least $50. I found this unwelcoming. They should write it some where instead."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since opening night. They offer a wonderful selection and variety of Iraqi & Kurdish-inspired middle eastern food and hookah all in one place which is a bonus! 

They offer live music/events on most weekends which I drive 40 minutes for and have a large dance floor and well-equipped stage. The owners are so kind and really treat you like you're part of their family. Their large patio is perfect for the Arizona weather, and on days it's a little chilly they have heated lamps going so you're not uncomfortable. I really recommend the chicken biryani... it is delicious and the portions are enough that you'll probably have to request a leftover box :)

The only reason I'm rating this a four is because they're often so busy and because the restaurant is fairly new that their staff tends to fall a little behind and it takes a bit longer to receive your order, but overall I always have a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Zad Al Khair is a newly opened Middle Eastern Style Restaurant opened daily for lunch, dinner, late night dinner, entertainment and hookah. This is an Iraqi style restaurant. They offer a very large patio and the inside is also very large and looks more like a banquet hall than a restaurant. Some Iraqi fixtures and other items accent the place.

My review is based on only one dinner visit and if I ignore the appetizer I was served then I can award three stars meaning that this restaurant is worth a try. We started with hummus that they top with your choice of chicken or beef. I asked for chicken and they served me beef. The beef had interesting seasonings but unfortunately it was chewy and dry with grizzle. I was frightened at this point and wondered if we should stay. Honestly I thought the meat could have passed for chewy camel and the pita was hard and crisp like matzo...hummus was average.

For dinner I ordered off the Iraqi menu and tried Iraqi Style Chicken Biryani. This dish was tasty. It had the usual taste of Middle Eastern Style dishes of turmeric, allspice and cinnamon and the chicken was moist. I thought it was odd that they added chopped french fries to the dish instead of potatoes but I do know that in the mid east often French Fries are added to certain dishes....Usually street food like pitas. As tasty as the dish really was I did feel that I was served a striped down version of Iraqi Chicken Biryani because this dish is usually made with vermicelli, almonds and raisins that I didn't have. My dish also came with a bean soup that would have been delicious if it didn't have a burnt pan taste to it. My husband had the Iraqi Tashreed with Beef. It was basically Lamb in a tomato/beef based sauce over bread. The lamb was prepared nicely and fell off the bone but needed the flavor of the sauce to be tasty.

 Our waitress was very kind and understanding and we told her about the burnt tasting bean soup and she gave us some Iraqi Tea to try. The tea had a different taste to it that was almost bitter like the bitter parts of an orange to me and needed sugar.

The food had a very homestyle feel to it. It was like someone from your family cooked it if they were Iraqi. Some things were good and some things were screwed up.

This restaurant has something different to offer and this might be a good restaurant that just needs to hit their groove. I note that this is a newly opened restaurant and they are still working things out."}
{"text":"Food was great staff! Staff was very friendly lamb chops were on point!! Kibeh was amazing, must come here"}
{"text":"Food is normal not special at all. 
Music sound is very ear damaging although we asked the waiter to lower it, but she ignored! 
Service is good though! 
In short, it is my first and last time."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would...AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!  In all honesty, this place was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Phoenix....and I enjoyed this lovely experience for a bill of $45 for two basic meals.  Really!

The server tried to be nice and gave us tiny free desserts with hot tea, so we tipped him too well for the place.
But the food--omg!  Horrible!  First of all, we ordered some stew type Middle Eastern food that was refrigerator freezing cold--and this was supposed to be a hot meal.  I am not kidding about that either:  the beans had a tiny bit of heat like it was microwaved maybe 15 seconds in the middle, and the rest was refrigerator cold as if they had been sitting in the fridge for a couple days.
The rice was dry but ok, but it was supposed to be with lamb.  The lamb--which was in such teeny pieces and old as in 2-3 days old lamb--was mixed in.  I just hope it was lamb, but who could tell cause it was in such teeny pieces and appeared to have been cut off probably another's customer's plate who sent it back.  It was laughable if it wasn't so pathetic.
The food is just horrible here. My friend suggested it, and I could tell she wanted to die she was so embarrassed since this ended up being a $45 bill for a 1 pm lunch meal.
Look at the interior, too:  the curtains are nice, but the windows are just absolutely filthy and have never ever been cleaned which is not appealing at all for eating.  Heaven only knows what the kitchen must look like, and I don't want to see it either.
This place is a total mess.  Unless you want freezing food in a filthy environment, I'd suggest you find another place to eat."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Bad food and service! Worst place I have been to! $16 for burned lamb chops. Worst of the worst. They ruined Mother's Day for us!"}
{"text":"First time at this place got there around 1:00 am they were still open great service nice staff friendly we left little after 3:00 am and they were still serving customer. Hookah food alcohol music live singer and etc. good place will visit again on my next trip"}
{"text":"The place is decorated nicely. It has potential. Staff is kind, but this is a restaurant. A business. Kind is not going to make people come back if the rice is dry, the chicken is just alright, server makes mistakes on the order, they never refill the water, and the food takes an hour to come out. 

I took my mother here because it looked like a hole in the wall and hole-in-the-walls are usually good. We were wrong. (My mother had to share my food because her order took so long, we had to ask for it to go)

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Wrost food I ever had in my life meat was cold n the waiter touching his finger on the meat n saying no its like that cuz of humus like wtf we r not eating first time  and the bread was not fresh they just put in microwave  n bring so the food was really really bad ."}
{"text":"Very nice Iraqi restaurant on the west side of town.  Very pleasant atmosphere,  nice music playing in the background.  We arrived at 730pm, and were the only customers. Good martini, nice beef kabob, excellent baba ghanoush. Will definitely come back!"}
