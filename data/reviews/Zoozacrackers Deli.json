{"text":"Matzoh ball hard as a rock, and I like 'em hard, but this one was tasteless. Only 7 noodles. I miss Cantor's; I stayed on this part of the Strip to be close to Cantor's! The shell of the knish was too hard to cut with a knife, so basically just some mashed potatoes. Better matzoh ball soup at Carnegie, and better knish, and comes with a dish of pickles!"}
{"text":"I was SO happy when we decided to eat at this resaturant! As a vegan I wasn't sure what I would eat in Vegas. I was sure I was doomed to eat salads and bean burritos all weekend...but I was wrong. Steve Wynn makes sure that all restaurants at the Wynn have a vegan option. The option at Zooza's is a Vegan Cheeseburger, fries, and a vegan chocolate shake. The burger was okay. It was made with Gardein. The fries were good, but the shake was GREAT! I was also pleasantly surprised by the price. I thought that the combo of ebing vegan and being at the Wynn would break me...but it was only $9 for the combo. Very reasonable for vegan food in Vegas. Thank you Wynn for giving me some yummy food!"}
{"text":"We got the reuben, pastrami sandwhich, and chicken BLT. They were all very good and the portions were big. I loved the reuben. The pastrami, sour kraut, russian dressing, melted swiss cheese, and toasted marble rye were all very good together. The deli also has a great name, another plus. Five stars."}
{"text":"Even the schmancy fancy Wynn has a Jewish deli! I had the privilege of eating here just last week, and it was just the nosh I needed. The homemade knishes were really good, with a nice peppery kick. The matzo ball soup was satisfying as well. I was fully primed to continue my night afterward."}
{"text":"This place is exactly average. It's rather pricey, but that's true of most anything on the Strip. The manhattan clam chowder is decent, a little too spicy and watery for mcc. Not the best, not the worst. I ordered a pastrami reuban and received a corned beef reuban. The corned beef was too fatty for my taste and a little tough. The reuban I had at the airport on the way into Vegas was better than this one."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They got 2 of our orders wrong and when we told them they didn't want to change it. The manager later wanted to change the order however after literally waiting for 45 mins we still did not have our correct order. The waitress came and took my plate without asking if I'm done eating it or not. Horrible horrible customer service. Food isn't that good either."}
{"text":"This place bills itself as \"the best N.Y. style deli West of the Hudson\" and I have actually BEEN to the best delis in NY City, so GAME ON Zoozacrackers.  We were looking forward to a late dinner, where we could get good food without a major production or long wait.  We definitely found it here.     The food was really terrific - you order at a counter and they give you a number and bring your food to your table.  We had a Rueben, motzo ball soup, a BLT, and a cheesecake dessert.   Very fresh tasting, excellent quality ingredients.  Our total bill came to around $55 (we just had tap water to drink) which is slightly a lot for what we had but I thought the value was definitely there.  I have no problem paying a premium for great food. The wait for our food was not bad at all.  We arrived about 45 min before closing time and there was still a pretty decent size crowd - the seating area was at least 3/4 full.  We tried to go to this place before but they were closed - closing time is fairly early for Vegas - like 11 pm so don't miss out."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this review because there's so much good food in the Wynn and Encore, but the vegan burger here is one of the most pitiful things I've ever eaten. It's basically a vegan version of a flat, crappy McDonald's burger that was cooked briefly in a microwave. The shake and fries were okay."}
{"text":"Just got back from Vegas and grabbed a quick lunch at Zoozacracker's when we were messing around in the Sports Book at the Wynn.  Decent deli, but a long wait for your food.  People were all very nice, but it seemed like a very inefficient operation.  If you're wanting a good deli to quell a big hunger, I would pass.  If you're wanting to hang out at the Wynn and just need a quick bite, Zooz will do the job."}
{"text":"My OOT guests wanted to go to the Wynn on New Years, cause, well, that's what people want to do when they come to Vegas -- gamble, drink and shop.      Of course, as soon as we get there, I am suddenly really hungry and feel like I can't make it to dinner.  Normally, I try to avoid eating on the strip because I feel like I have to sell an organ to pay for the food.  (What? $10 for a hot dog at Pink's, Planet Hollywood???)  We ended up stopping by ZoozaCrackers as it was next to the sports book, a requested stop on our excursion.    I ended up getting chicken fingers, fries and a coke.  While it wasn't cheap (approximately $20), it was actually good!  The chicken actually tasted like, well, chicken.  (I really need to stop eating at McDonald's because I have no idea what that stuff is that it calls Chicken McNuggets).  It was warm and nicely seasoned with pepper.  The fries were also fresh out the fryer.    Overall, a great place to stop by and have a quick snack.  And depending on where you sit, you may have a good vantage point of the games playing in the sports book area :-)"}
{"text":"Had relatives in town over the weekend and needed a restaurant for a quick dinner before their plane.  We came here so I could have something to eat with them since they have a vegan menu.  As Ryan mentions below, Dylan has got to be one of the worse employees I have ever seen in a major hotel on the strip.  I asked for the vegan menu about 4 times before he decided to give me a copy of it.  It's not like he had to go get one as they were stacked right next to the cash register literally under his right hand.  Kept asking me if the order was \"for here or to go\".  I would tell him \"here\" and he would stare at me and ask it all over again.  Finally I said very slowly \"I will be eating this HERE\".    I ordered the $9 cheeseburger special and the vegan matza ball soup.  The soup was huge.  Full of chopped carrots and celery and a single matza ball. I guess they've cut back on the 3 matza balls from the 2010 review.  The matza ball was hard (just the way I like them) but very bready inside.  It's almost like they used flour instead of matza meal to make it. The vegetable broth had absolutely no flavor.  I must have dumped 6T of salt and pepper in it to give it flavor.  The cheeseburger special was nothing to write home about.  An extremely small burger (think kids size from one of the chains) with a soggy bland white bread bun, a small Gardein burger, a single slice of soy american cheese, mustard and  a couple of pickle slices.  A small bowl of french fries (crisp but bland) and an 8oz cup of chocolate milkshake.  The milkshake was not very thick and had a very pronounced cocoa aftertaste.    Granted, it was all vegan but still...  I felt like I was eating a kids happy meal without the toy.  That's how small everything was.  Went home and had dinner.  5 stars for the vegan options -10 stars for the price vs size"}
{"text":"Solid place to have a causal meal.   Went here twice during our stay. First time was a Saturday. We wanted to grab lunch to-go for the Wynn pool. I had the turkey Reuben and the GF had the roast beef. Being a NYC style deli, had a nice pile of meat. The Reuben was pretty good and the GF enjoyed her roast beef.   Next day, we ate here before our flight. I had the Benny, which is two poach eggs on cheese on pastrami. GF had the corn beef sandwich and the friend had pastrami sandwich. Benny was ok. Small portion, I should of gotten a sandwich. The GF and friend was satisfied with their sandwich.   So for Vegas standards, this was a causal laid-back eatery. If you don't feel like going to a ritzy place at the Wynn or don't want to stuff yourself at the buffet or don't want to go to the mall. This was a good option. For all those who complain about the prices, are you all Vegas virgins. You're on the Vegas Strip, eating at the Wynn. Of course, it's not going to be cheap or low price.   A place worth considering when you don't want the fuss."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the taste doesn't even make up for it.  $10 for an egg salad sandwich and a grocery store product would taste better.  There were four of us and there wasn't a single good thing to say about any of our meals.  Nothing quite annoys you like paying $30 for two unappetizing sandwiches."}
{"text":"For taking a cheat day on vacation I have to say the angus burger I shared with my husband was well worth it. Affordable for its location the food won't disappoint. You order at the cashier and they bring your meal to you. Add the bacon and cheese to the burger... You are worth it : )"}
{"text":"Quick comfort food that's good to eat but expect overpricing.... But the portion is good so i guess it works out.   My husband and I ate here twice during our stay at encore Bc it was super quick and easy access. The lines love pretty fast and you can seat anywhere you want.   We had the avocado turkey sandwich, chicken tortilla soup, chicken noodle soup, chopped salad, turkey breast sandwich, hot pastrami... Overall I'd say that the food is similar to an upgraded corner bakery.  Perhaps a little bit better.   I'd go back just for the convenience."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Wynn prior to checking in to our hotel.  Was hungry and looked at Zoozacrackers, figured a small sandwich would hit the spot.  Well the sandwiches are anything but small. We had the roast beef and blt. They were both great. Thankfully we didn't order any sides (had dinner res for a few hour later), we will next time though.  A real nice place to eat."}
{"text":"This place was awful! We stopped here for a quick dinner before a show and got horrible service. One in our party has a gluten allergy and ordered nachos with corn chips and an appetizer. Half an hour later, after everyone else in the party had received their food, an employee Haydee came out and informed us that the nachos were flour tortillas and that they could bring something else for a higher charge. They never brought out the appetizer and we informed her that we just wanted to cancel the order since we didn't have time to wait for something else to be made. The manager came by at this point and said she would just refund it. We waited another 10-15 minutes and told them we needed the refund receipt because we needed to leave to the show. The manager Rikki and employee Haydee said they couldn't find the order (though they had our original receipt)  and there was nothing they could do. How awful. Had to pay for a full meal that was never received. We will not be coming back here. Rikki and Haydee were completely unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"Ok, this place can get pricey quick, but if you know how to get \"bang\" for the buck like me you'll be ok.  My friend and I got the Veggie sandwich with extra roast beef.  I really need to invest in a real camera, because what we got was a 5 star Roast beef sandwich for 15 bux.  With Coffee and cake we were under $30 bux for the both of us.  I will say this....if you eat more food than what came out you really need a diet.  It was MORE THAN enough.  Split your food here as its just too much for one person and you don't want to take leftovers back with you do you?  Great sammy, half sour pickle with decent coffee.  Geez the chocolate cake is good.  Fries mehhhh."}
{"text":"Looking for a clean, self service Deli with great sandwiches and friendly table staff... ZooZaCrackers is the place. Order your sandwiches, take a seat with a table flag and your served in no time. We ordered breakfast, returned for lunch the next day and both were fresh, hot and served with a smile. Finished with a dish and the attentive staff swoops in to pick it up for you. If you get a hankering for a libation, there is a bar that sits in-between ZooZaCrackers Deli and the Race and Sports Bar Lounge (technically part of the Sports Book but on the same elevation as the Deli) that is well worth the visit. The bar features many TV's playing all sports and the tenders were more than attentive. I tried and stuck with their chili, Bloody Mary. A bit on the small and expensive side but made with a chili pepper infused vodka, a full, thick and crispy slice of bacon and two tiny vegetables which contained either onion, radish, carrot or parsnip. If you like Bloody Mary's, it is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service, food and experience were all fantastic!  I enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.  If one of your dopey friends suggests \"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher."}
{"text":"Voce se sente o rei da cocada preta neste lugar!"}
{"text":"Really small potato knish for $10.  Mom didn't like her vegan either.    Water (tap, not bottled) tasted reality funny.  I felt my whole mouth covered with grit or sand.  Made me wonder about the ice.  I doubt they used Fiji water to make the ice :)    Won't come back here I suggest you don't either.   Not good quality or  a good deal.  Staff was grumpy too :P  I suggest you try somewhere else.  This place is REALLY bad."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw the corned beef on the menu I was psyched. Ordered it on rye with  spicy deli mustard. It was delivered promptly and almost looked like a corned beef sandwich should look. Meat piled high.  That's as close as it got.  The corned beef was so dry that it absorbed the moisture from my mouth as soon as I took a bite, and it was cool. They needed to steam the meat and the bread. The good news was the pickle was very good  $13.00 dollars for half a dill pickle is a little steep even for the Wynn!  It was ok, but disappointing.  The Wynn maintains pretty high standards and this fell a little short."}
{"text":"The vegan wrap was a good choice for lunch, healthy, filling, and tasty, and came with a choice of non-alcoholic drink.  The vegan burger was small, with a really pale bun, the burger patty, cheese slice, sauce, and from memory,  Pickle slices. It looked like a junior burger and when it came to the table I thought, \"Is that it?\" I did not expect that from Wynn. It's the least appealing burger I've seen. The burger came with French fries and a small vegan chocolate milkshake that was okay."}
{"text":"Deli sandwiches, soups and deserts! Cozy NYC style restaurant and sports book. Great combination! I had pastrami of coarse!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas and this place was recommended to me. The food was great (try the Vegan Wynn burger-- absolutely amazing). We went here several times.  The only complaint I have is the wait time-- and that the serving staff often seemed to get orders wrong or confused, which was odd, because we were specifically given a number when we ordered.  Still, one of the best places I've eaten."}
{"text":"Let's be very honest here...this ain't a New York Deli like it claims to be, so don't expect the second coming of the Carnegie or Stage Deli (Stage Deli in NYC is sadly no longer in business)...with that out of the way and on record I will still say that I was pleasantly surprised with Zoozacrackers and will gladly return again.  Service is very basic and a tip is not required as you stand in line to order to have your meal delivered to your table shortly after.  I had their pot roast and being from North Carolina where pot roast is a mastered art I was very impressed and thought it was very good.  Looking around at other patron's dishes their sandwiches and soups looked very appetizing.    If you are in need of a quick snack, or a bite to eat to hold you over through a show and/or until your 9PM dinner reservation this is a perfect spot to hit up, not to mention it offers a good break from the Casino!"}
{"text":"Shared a corned beef sandwich, perfect size to share. I asked for well done French fries and they were exactly that in the potato salad was delicious. The only negative I would say they could have brought an extra plate for us to share and we asked for a glass for our beer which never arrived. The beer was WAY overpriced also."}
{"text":"It's a deli that's located in a 5 star resort and casino on the Las Vegas Strip.  Yes I expected the food to be a bit better, but it makes a decent lunch location.  I've been here a few times and each time the food's been alright.  I would have given it 4 stars but I find the food to be overpriced for the quality of food that they serve.  A regular sandwich or burger alone will set you back 12-15 dollars and all sides are a la carte and they're priced at 4-6 dollars depending on what you order.  I like to stay at the Wynn which makes this restaurant convenient but there are better lunch locations on the strip that fit the bill."}
{"text":"Zoozacracker's is my favorite place to eat In Vegas for a fast but delicious meal. The sandwiches are very fresh and they usually put a lot of meat on them. The Ruben sandwich used to have so much meat on it but maybe they just put less this time. Anyways, the soups and salads are so tasty, I'm getting hungry writing this review!! Service is always great and the food makes it even better. Excited to go back soon, definitely go try Zoozacracker's!!"}
{"text":"Well I was told by the check in staff a great place to go. Well it was not!!!  I ordered a Cobb salad to go and it took 29 minutes and the salad was horrible.  Only like an ounce of chicken. Just not good."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Sandwiches are freakin' enormous!  Seriously, as big as a baby's head!  You could easily share a single sandwich between two people.  I had a chicken salad on sourdough and my friend opted for egg salad.  I think he was happier with his.  There wasn't anything wrong with mine, per se, just nothing special.  The bread was cut too thinly.  I normally wouldn't even notice that except that with a giant mound of chicken salad between the two slices, the bread quickly started breaking apart and I was left with a mayonaise-y mess.  It's just off the casino floor and it's very open-air so it was a little noisy."}
{"text":"Took over 20 minutes to get a sandwich which was ICE COLD. Manger agreed, and came back with another which did not have the corn-beef as requested, and the 2nd choice meat was not lean as also requested.."}
{"text":"We found this place looking for a quick bite to eat. It is counter service. The food was good, but I would not hurry back. The service was solid and quick. The avocado on my chicken avocado melt was perfect, the bread had more butter on it than it needed - it was a slightly above average sandwich, but for 15 dollars I expected more."}
{"text":"I had worked up quite the appetite after spending the day in the Sportsbook experiencing march madness so headed to the cafe for a burger.    The 100% angus burger with fries should have hit the spot.  I would have been better off going to mcdonalds.  The burger patty had absolutely no taste and was clearly a frozen patty.  The bun was huge resulting a a poor bun to huger ratio.  Fries do not come with the burger so i expected I nice sized portion but only a small plate was served.   I expected more from the Wynn than a frozen tasteless burger."}
{"text":"I should say, \"Yay! I'm *usually* a fan.\" But for our latest visit, last week, the quality of the meat (pastrami) had slipped. Way too fatty, and it was difficult to cut even the non-fatty meat, if any pastrami can make that claim. Not the best way to start our visit.  Zoosacrackers is a cafeteria-style \"deli\" on the edge of the casino. You go through a line, then find a table and wait for your meal.   I like the idea of having this casual restaurant handy at the Wynn. And we have usually liked the food. Maybe it was just an off day for pastrami? Hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Great spot at Wynn. Right next to the Sportsbook so it worked out great. Prices are high but your paying for the location. Food was very good. Buffalo wings were cooked very well (a little on the crispy side) and had a nice little kick to them. Fries were pretty average. Burgers were on the larger side and tastey. Large selection to choose from for sandwichs and salads. Friendly staff and nice touch after you place your order you are given a tabletop flag, then find a nice seat in the sportsbook or in the restaurant and thet will find you and bring your food to your table. Worth a stop when at Wynn or passing through."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT deli.  Insanely overpriced, but still cheaper than the other dining options at the Wynn, so we ate here a few times.    Pastrami and swiss on rye is really flavorful and juicy.  Really solid deli-meat piled high with tangy spicy mustard and cheese.  The bread is very fresh as well.  Also had some pastrami-stuffed kinish that was basically a hot, tasty potato pocket that looked sort of like a samosa, with pastrami and cheese shooting up out of it.  It was so filling and, though i balked at the price, the amount of food that came in this little side made me appreciate the value a bit more.  I ordered a Zoozacrackers salad as well which was a large (ok, GIANT) mixed greens chopped salad with egg, pastrami, corned beef, cheeses, etc all mixed in liberally.    For a deli in a casino (especially given the other, more expensive choices around the casino floor), this place exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"The worse place to eat. My family and I ordered burgers. 3 out of 4 got sick. The burgers were awful. I woke up middle of the night and was vomiting and had food burn for next two days. My husband had nausea and my brother was vomiting all morning. They got better middle of the day but I had that feeling for two days. I couldn't enjoy my expensive stay in Encore. The worse part was that the hotel didn't accept what they did to us. Not even apology. I am so upset that I chose their hotel among all the places that I could choose and stay. This trip was important because it was a family reunion. I couldn't join my family members and enjoy the trip and they had to stay in the hotel because of me. A waist of time and money."}
{"text":"Zooza is always a great lightweight snack or for lunch.  When we leave Vegas I always miss a basic deli like Zooza so I look forward to the next trip."}
{"text":"Whilst seeking out a place for a very late dinner, we stumbled in here since Terrace Cafe was closed. Although they're well known for their pastrami sandwich, I of course took the plate less traveled and opted for their special that night, which was the pot roast. Jackpot hit! A generous portion of it served up with mashed potatoes and carrots was more than I could ask for. Needless to say, that plate was polished off and I was ready to party. One of a few places between the Wynn and Encore with food options that won't break your wallet."}
{"text":"If fast is what you need and all you need then ZooZoocrackers is your spot. All I could taste in my fajita were the hot peppers. Turkey sandwich dry and boring on stale bread. Chocolate milkshake way too much chocolate and not yummy. My stomach still hurts from the fajita peppers."}
{"text":"Although the sandwich I got (Turkey) tasted very good, and the fries were also good, it ended up giving me food poisoning. Thankfully it only lasted about 12 hours, and didn't ruin my whole trip. The Deli seemed to be well run, and the service was quite fast and good. Naturally they charge a lot for the food, but when you are staying at Encore, that's how it goes :)"}
{"text":"I make sure to always get in a meal here when I'm in Vegas! The vegan Wynn burger, fries, and vegan chocolate shake is my go-to meal. I'm drooling just thinking about it! Tip: you can ask for a larger size shake and they just charge a couple extra dollars for it. Totally worth it. My spouse is not vegan and has tried many of the real deli sandwiches- the portions are huge and delicious. It can take a little while to get food because it's always busy, but it's well worth the wait. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Random and strange, Las Vegas is. This was one of THE BEST delis I have ever been to! I guess good ol' LV knows it's food. Well, I guess I knew that.  Giant matzo ball soup. Delectable potato knish that puts Corky & Lenny's to shame. And a roasted turkey sandwich, shaved thin, NOT shiny turkey thank god! Fluffy rye bread with a crisp crust, and the Russian dressing made it my dream sandwich.  Best deli I've been to outside of New York! Random and strange, yes it is."}
{"text":"Hubby and I both had the turkey burger. It hit the spot. The honey wheat bun is huge!"}
{"text":"I am bumping them up to 4 stars b/c of the Latkes!  I had Latkes for the first time here. SOOO GOOOD!!!   What is Latkes? They are potato pancakes--shallow-fried pancakes of grated or ground potato, flour and egg,  flavored with grated onion or garlic and seasoning.  Ordered: 1) Latkes: 5/5 SO GOOD---most likely SUPER unhealthy, but who cares?! :) 2) Chicken avocado sandwich: 3/5 Typical--good but nothing extraordinary 3) 7 layer cake 2/5: Of course..we had to order desserts...This was actually disappointing--not as good as it looks."}
{"text":"This is a nice little hidden gem in the Wynn.  Great food, affordable prices, nice quality food with nice silverware.    We had a nice salmon dinner with a grilled lemon, green beans, and mashed potatoes for only $18.95!  It is a great value for the Wynn!!!  We were impressed!  The food was freshly cooked to order and was delivered in a reasonable amount of time (20 mins or so).  They didn't really have table service other than delivering the food.  We also went back a couple of times for a milkshake at night...  Get a cookies and cream milkshake, you will love it!  I want one right now!  : )"}
{"text":"It's better than the other cafe at the Wynn, and while still very expensive, it's reasonable compared to other options in the hotel.  The food looked pretty fresh.  Unfortunately, the line takes forever.  I guess I am just used to the NYC lines that keep moving quickly, but it was frustrating waiting on this line.  We were really hungry and thought a deli place would be a quick place to get a sandwich.  Not so much.  After waiting online and finally ordering, we got our number and sat down.  and waited.  and waited some more.  We ordered a roast beef sandwich and chicken noodle soup, what could we possibly have to wait for?  Finally it came and it was decent.  The waiter asked if we wanted a refill on our drink (which we did), and mustard (which we also did), but fifteen minutes later he never returned, so we just finished our food and left.    Maybe we just had a bad service experience and it's normally better.  The food was decent without being exceptional."}
{"text":"This is a deli, and neither of us ordered sandwiches, so maybe this review is a little off.  That being said, for thirty bucks, we got two soups and the appetizer sampler.    My soup was the daily special: Boston clam chowder.   It was a bit salty and not as thick or creamy as I would have liked.  The sampler consisted of hot wings, loaded nachos, and chicken fingers.  Both chicken dishes were normal bar food quality.  However, the nachos were lackluster.  They had movie nacho cheese on them, and I could barely taste the chili.  I could have totally skipped that option."}
{"text":"Always a quick, delicious authentic New York style deli sandwich, wrap, salad or even dessert.  It's not like the enormous Carnegie Deli type that you can barely fit in your mouth, which I like once in awhile.  They also serve Perrier Jouiet by the glass, but no Veuve.  Affordable, upscale and quick service.  One thing I really like is that while you dine you can see the whole Sportsbook so that's a big plus!    You may wonder who Charlie Meyerson is cause there's a very nice, wooden framed portrait 'In Honor of' him behind the bar.  He was Steve Wynn's best friend whom he thought Mr. Meyerson would like this deli.  Many of Steve's restaurants are name in honor of his best friends FYI.  I really like that.  A few items I really like on the menu $6.99-$14.99 Reuben Turkey Burger Clam Chowder  Deli Turkey Sandwich  Philly Cheesesteak  And the individual goodies closest to the cashier.    When you sit in VIP in the Sportsbook they have a wonderful Salmon, not sure where they get that from."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good but a little pricey, but isn't everything?   They were nice enough to keep serving breakfast for us even though we arrived right at 11, when it ends.   The breakfast wrap was pretty tasty, and it came with hash browns. Their hash browns were something special- super crunchy and crispy in a perfect way. Delicioso!   I'm still getting used to the whole Vegas thing, but it was pretty awesome being able to just jump in and have breakfast, and then walk right down the steps to a ton of slot machines. Win Win Wynn! hahaha"}
{"text":"Located just outside the Sports Book in the Wynn, this is a counter service joint offering traditional breakfasts, soup & salad lunches, and also has coffee and a full bar (what Vegas deli is complete without one?).  The food is definitely passable, but the real selling points are the price and convenience. I'm not saying a $12 sandwich is a bargain, but price is always relative, and for a hotel on the strip (and arguably the nicest hotel on the strip, at that), this is a super reasonable option, especially if you're hungry now and looking for something quick. Grab a table facing the casino floor and enjoy some great people watching."}
{"text":"Fantastic Reuben with extra thousand island.   Bottle of root beer and a bag of chips.   Fast friendly service.    We just checked in and stopped for a quick bite.  Not too busy and located inside of the sports book so got a little extra entertainment."}
{"text":"Hit the Wynn right before the Super Bowl kickoff.   With the advice of a friendly insider......we took our hungry asses down to Zoozacrackers for some food and since it was right next to the sports book, had a great seat for the first quarter while we ate.  The BBQ chicken salad was awesome and large enough to fill me up.  They had no problem meeting our special request for a Sourdough avacado chicken melt.....without the sourdough.   ha ha.  It was really good and protein style for my baby.     I would recommend this place as it was quick and reasonably priced considering the location.   Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"I had the layer cake.  I should say, my husband, I and the lady at the next table had the layer cake.   When it came out the lady at the next table almost died...she said \"You HAVE to tell me how good that is!\"  Seeing how ridiculously big it is, I took her plate and plopped a big hunk of it on there.  She almost cried!  Regardless of the hunk I gave away, my hubby and I still fought and struggled to finish the one piece of cake.  If you do not do any other crazy thing in Vegas, you MUST get a piece of cake from Zooza....$12.95 is a small price to pay for sugar induced bliss!"}
{"text":"Went here this afternoon because ever since I've heard that Wynn has added vegan options to his menus, I've been dying to try the vegan matzo ball soup.   Walked up to the counter with a friend and asked for the vegan menu, which is just three items but the soup was the only one I was interested in. My friend was also curious so she ordered it as well, and I also got a side of fries. We chose our seats and waited.   The soup was brought out about 15 minutes later (the cashier mentioned there would be a wait) in huge bowls on square plates. It was definitely the perfect amount of soup especially for the semi-high price tag of $6.95. It was essentially three medium-sized matzo balls, vegetable broth with small bits of carrot and celery. The vegetables were nice and crunchy, not soft and overcooked. The matzo balls were really good and held their shape well, they didn't fall apart easily. The fries I got were salty and crunchy and very good, but kind of a small portion. The soup tasted very good, it had a little bit of a tangy kick and my friend (a non-vegan) and I loved it and would definitely come back again to order it. Very tasty and a nice meal that just satiates you perfectly. A little pricey, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good sandwich or salad without breaking the bank in an otherwise expensive Wynn casino, Zoozacrackers provides a good option.   Since they only serve soup, sandwiches, and other deli food, things move fairly quickly. They also have cream soda, though they were out of it when I ordered.  The triple-decker club sandwich on rye was excellent.  It was big enough to be filling and satisfied my hunger.  There was plenty of turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  The chop vegetable salad had an awesome balsamic vinegar on it that made it nearly irresistible.  If you are looking for fast deli food and not a five-star gourmet experience, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I think anything after a long night of dancing and partying tastes good. 8 of us came here at around 4am or so and we were immediately seated. Our new friends that we met at XS kept insisting that somewhere in the Wynn they served chicken wings. Voila, I guess we found it. It was a short 5 minute walk from XS to here. We all managed to order some variation of chicken (tenders, wings, soup) and then ribs and a bagel sandwish. I went with the BBQ wings. They actually messed up at first and made buffalo, so I had to wait a bit longer for my order, but it was only 1 or 2 minutes more. Supposedly the soup was really good here. My BBQ wings weren't bad either. Was a bit pricey, 8-9 wings for $11 I think, but they definitely satisfied my hunger, and I even ended up take some home (guess I wasn't hungry). Later on we saw some ladies who looked like they were a part of AVN. Our 2 new friends kept us entertained with their sarcastic comments. Overall, a nice, quiet early morning meal with decent and friendly service."}
{"text":"While I'll give this place some credit for being \"reasonably priced\" by Wynn standards, the food offered here really wasn't up to par.   When staying at the Encore, I was VERY excited to see that there was a New York-style deli on the premises. I'm not sure if I was there on a bad day or not, but I left feeling a bit let down with my corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup.  First, the corned beef on my sandwich was a decent portion. (I was expecting there to be barely any and was pleasantly surprised with how much I got.) However, what I was served was probably the most dried-out corned beef I've ever been served. While it was lean and tasted OK, it was just dry-as-a-bone. Major fail. The rye bread was fresh enough, but nothing spectacular.  Moving on to the matzoh ball soup--also a mixed bag that overall didn't work. For the price, it was a very generous serving: a huge matzoh ball in a soup that's full of noodles, chicken, carrots, and celery. The matzoh ball itself was nice and soft. However, the chicken in the soup was so salty it was inedible (and I like salty). I wound up eating half the soup and just avoiding the chicken.  A decent place to grab a sammy in Vegas but would I call this place a real Jewish deli. Um, sorry, no."}
{"text":"We finally ended up here after deciding not to wait in line for the buffet at the Wynn. My friend and I both ordered the pastrami burger since it was recommended by the lady behind the counter. It took forever to get our food and was pretty pricey for a burger. I didn't know it was gonna have double meat- beef and slices of pastrami on top! Wow, I was so full after finishing the whole thing."}
{"text":"Good but overpriced food and no table service. Good hamburgers and sandwiches, salads and desserts. Everything fresh and tasty. But I paid $20 for a burger and small side salad (no fries), and they wanted to charge extra for a piece of cheese on the burger."}
{"text":"Probably the cheapest place to grab a bite in Wynn.  The food was pretty good, well seasoned, and tasted fresh. The place would get 5 stars from me if not for the service...  The service is the worst I've ever seen in any city, any state, and about what I'd expect from a McDonalds in the middle of nowhere, not from a cafe in a fancy five-star hotel. The hostess, from when we went, apparently had great difficulty in using the English language... After asking how to get a table (the set up is a bit strange, with a stand-in-line cafe that is also a sit-down normal restaraunt), she told us to get in line at the counter and put us on a list for a table. A few minutes later, I noticed other people, who arrived 10-15 mins after us were being seated but she had not called us. I went and saw that she had crossed us off. I argued, since that's what she had told us to do. She said that she had never said that. If I had been alone, I would have thought that I had just misunderstood. But both my friend and I, who had listened to her explanation, thought the exact same thing.   Since the 'customer is never right' here, apparently, the hostess proceeded to glare at us and basically told us that we were stupid and \"obviously\" didn't listen to what she had explained to us for about 5 minutes, at which point another male server/waiter/manager (? not sure what his job was) came, asked what was happening, etc. The male server told the hostess to move us to the top of the list and we finally got a table.  Apparently, the place turns from self-serve counter place to a sit-down restaurant with to go orders at the counter at 11 PM. Seeing as we arrived at 10:55 PM, apparently the hostess hadn't told us something incorrectly, so it was \"our fault\". But we were begrudgingly given a table.  Now here comes the fun part: the hostess (who apparently hated us for some reason) didn't tell a waitress that we were sitting (in the corner) and it took 30 minutes for a waitress to come serve us. Once the waitress came, things became okay since she was awesome and came to check on us often, apologizing for the delay.  Honestly, I think the hotel should be ashamed at hiring such spiteful people who yell at you for their mistakes. But maybe I'm just expecting too much?"}
{"text":"Shared a very good rueben and french fries here with a friend.  You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it out to you.  We actually got it to go and brought upstairs to our room."}
{"text":"So they sell a lot of Jewish-type foods.  I don't know much about Jewish foods so I can't offer much of a comparison but what we did order was delicious.  Mine was two eggs on top of some kind of salty meat and potato latke with Russian dressing drizzled on top.  I didn't think I'd like it b'c the Russian dressing tasted like Thousand Island but was hot.  I warmed up to it!  Nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I should really know better... Any restaurant in the Wynn is going to be pricey.    We were there for a show and wanted to grab a quick bite before heading in.  Zoozacrackers offers a wide variety on their menu from appetizers like Buffalo Wings to burgers to pasta.  Their lines are long but seem to move pretty fast.  You order first, find a table and they bring your food out to you.  Luckily we didn't have to wait long before our food arrived.  Buffalo wings are just ok along with the wrap and fries.    It's not a place to rush back to but it's probably the cheapest in the Wynn."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good prices and fun atmosphere.  Went here with my great aunt and uncle, who said it was the best deli on the strip.  They were right.  The menu is approachable and filling.  We had the matzo ball soup, knish and a wrap, and it was all delicious.  Service was a bit ho-hum, but to be expected at a deli, even in the Wynn."}
{"text":"Ordered over $50 worth of food and wasn't given parts of our order. Manager spoke to us, said we received our food. Trust me, I know what we ordered. Then after more complaining, the manager acknowledged that she didn't actually see out order. Group was incredibly unhappy and disappointed to be lied to. Been going here for 5-6 years. Won't be visiting any more. We spend good money to stay at the hotel and have a quality time, not be lied to by incompetent managers who don't give us the food we pay for. Sad. Steve Wynn should be disappointed to see his name be used on such a poorly run establishment."}
{"text":"This place is a small cafe located inside of the Wynn. It's right next to the sports book. The food they have here are like sandwiches, hamburgers, hotdogs, etc. The food is reasonably priced averaging around $10. I ordered the hotdog and fries. The hotdog was pretty huge. It'll definitely fill you up. The fries were pretty good. The food is what you would expect from a casual cafe. The place can get really busy so it might be hard to find a table. You might just have to wait a bit for people to get up.  This place is a pretty good place to eat if you are wanting something fast and not so expensive. Definitely worth a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fat me loved this place! My stomach has shrunk a lot so it's not as enjoyable now, unfortunately.  Okay yeah this place is pricey. It's at the Wynn so it's actually the more fast if not economical option.   The burger is amazing and so is the pastrami sandwich. There's even a pastrami burger for the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Likely the only affordable meal at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers is an absolute necessity if you find yourself in the big, black monolith on an empty stomach.  It was decidedly unpretentious and very pleasant - you order at the counter, sit down, watch television (Zooza's located right next to the sports book), and eventually your order will be delivered.  I opted for a delicious tuna sandwich and a raspberry iced tea.  Both were good.  I should've tried the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Horrible, stay away!!! Took 30 minutes for a hot dog and chicken sandwich.  If we didn't ask for the manager, the food would have never come.  When it was brought to the manger's attention, they magically brought it out to us.  Told the insincere manager we wanted a refund, then that took ten minutes. Then we had to wait for him to find our credit card.  Over a 40 minute wait for no food, don't go."}
{"text":"Perfect place for the casual meal when you don't feel up for a buffet or the coffee shop.  I've only had the chicken strips here, but they were very good.  Not too much batter, good seasonings.  You figure if a place bombs on something simple as chicken strips, then there's something very wrong.    The menu has a pretty good selection of sandwiches and some hot items as well.  Nice atmosphere - if you go during non crowded times.   It's clean.  Service is friendly.  Food served to your table."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Wynn Hotel for several years and have watched ZooZoo go through regular downswings. The food is very mediocre AGAIN and now they have gotten rid of almost all the deserts. It's so sad that orders are often wrong, the attitude bored and who needs a New York style deli with just a few terrible deserts. All the other Wynn Hotel restaurants are fabulous."}
{"text":"Really poor quality for Wynn.  And Wynn desperately needs yummy casual dinning!    If ya like meat sandwiches; and I mean meat and bread come here!  Not tasty at all!  French fries were delicious, only high point.  Maybe try a wrap or salad?"}
{"text":"This is a definite go to spot when I'm looking for lunch/dinner in the Wynn.  Service is always quick and the menu has just enough offerings of New York style deli sandwiches, wraps, salads, and desserts. Price is fair for the Las Vegas strip area and matches the quality, quantify,and taste of the food.   I highly recommend the BBQ chicken salad: a large portioned mixed salad with plenty of chicken and fresh avocado on top.   Free hotel/casino wifi is available while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Thanks to John B., I knew right away that there was a \"vegan fast-food\" style meal available at The Wynn for an affordable price.  Fresh off the plane and too hungry and tired to deal with a full service-restaurant just yet, I hopped into Zoozacrackers Deli for a quick meal. It felt good to walk through the air-conditioned resort and putting a bet in the sports book before arriving here.  You order at the counter, and find a spot to sit. For a deli, this has to be the fanciest deli I've ever stepped foot into. If it wasn't for the quick-service type ordering, you'd think this was another one of Wynn's expensive and exclusive restaurants. Huge spacious booths lined with top quality fabric, plenty of gorgeous light fixtures throughout and a very elegant floor plan.  The menu has quite a large selection, but luckily the vegan option is highlighted in green right in the middle of the board! For $11, you get a Gardein cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake.  The fries were delicious-perfectly crunchy and just the right amount of seasoning. The shake was absolutely amazing. It hit the right spot and cooled me down, why the extra chocolate flavor made me feel like a kid.  Unfortunately the cheeseburger did not do it for me. It looked like a McDonald's burger-and I mean that in the bad way. It was too 'perfect' as in unnatural looking. The bun was starchy and tasted like cheap fast food bun. The burger itself didn't have the delicious gardein taste I know-lack of seasoning. All in all very bland, very plain, and mimicked fast food burger a little too much.  Kyle H. bought a veggie sandwich and that was much more delicious! Way more fresh too. He also bought the Matzo Ball soup, which I did not eat of course. I was just more intrigued by the giant thing that was floating in his soup. Supposedly it was the Matzo Ball, I think it is more like an aliem egg about to hatch into something more sinister.  Overall, for the price and for something quick and convenient, it was okay. Maybe next time I'll substitute the cheeseburger for another chocolate shake. I might get diabeetus, but for this chocolate shake it's almost worth it."}
{"text":"My friends and I had already checked out & were looking for a place to lounge around.  The deli has a side to it close to the sports bar w/ very nice, large comfy couches & lots of TVs, but there is a 1 drink minimum for each person (can be non-alcoholic) to sit in this area.    I ordered potato skins to snack on, and these were the best I've ever had!!!  The outside of the skins were so crispy, they tasted like chips.  It came w/ a generous heap of bacon, sour cream, and chives.  It was one of my favorite meals of my Vegas weekend, so I'll definitely come back next time...they do the unhealthy but affordable fast food right!"}
{"text":"The Reuben was meh. Nothing special. They do give a lot of meat, which I do tend to like but wasn't too fond of the bread. Fries were delicious though! Free refills for sodas!"}
{"text":"Great place for late night eats at a good price in the beautiful Wynn/Encore Hotel property!   I highly recommend their sandwiches and chicken tenders with French fries!"}
{"text":"Great little deli jem in the middle of a plethora of options at Wynn!  We had the Triple Decker Club and it was absolutely yummy! The $8 bowl of Matzo Ball soup was served in practically a large salad bowl. We ordered potato knish (when at a Deli must have a deli experience) which is a mashed potato-stuffed pastry at it was excellent.   One thing we did not like was the Mac and cheese because it had either blue cheese or Gorgonzola cheese in it. Either way the taste did not work for us :(. No points lost b/c it is a preference thing.   Comfy booths overlooking casino floor, lively atmosphere. We loved it!"}
{"text":"When I got in to town I was starving so we went to zooza...... The line moved slowly. Everything I wanted would take at least 15 minutes or more - so I was told. Fish ' n chips, burgers don't take that long. Did they actually have a kitchen?   Anyway, I decided on a $9 hotdog - came with a dry bun. No effort put into it like toasting it or buttering it up and grilling it. Yawn. No sriracha, cholula or real relish. Just a crappy packet of no-name relish. Yeah, I can be high maintenance. For $9, I have the right to be high maintenance.  BTW, we were at the Wynn over the weekend and ZZC was not open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Although I no longer eat meat I will admit there are times I miss having a normal hamburger.  Luckily one of my Vegas companions said we had to come here so I could try their Vegan burger meal.  Wow!  The burger made me feel like I was eating a burger from a McDonald's Happy Meal, and it brought back fond memories of being able to eat a quick bite almost anywhere at any time.  I relished every bite. The burger comes as part of a package deal for nine dollars, it comes with fries and a \"chocolate\" shake.  The fries were greasy and as I had recently had Bouchon's fries (which are divine) I only ate a few.  The shake was chocolate but the taste of coconut was so pervasive I would have called it a coconut chocolate shake.  I thought it was adequate for what it was, a vegan shake.  One of my dining companions wanted her own shake and they would not sell her one separately, you had to buy the package.  She is not a vegetarian and she likes coconut, so if you love coconuts, and are vegan, you will probably think this shake was amazing.     I had three other dining companions and everyone liked what they had.  I have to say the Pot Roast dinner looked very good, and my other companions enjoyed their sandwiches.  I don't like to smell smoke while I am eating and even though this establishment is right off the casino floor I found it to be a relaxing and enjoyable place to eat a relatively quick meal before exploring more of all that Vegas has to offer.  If you are a vegetarian who misses having a real burger I think you will enjoy this one enormously."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve and we realized that we hadn't made any dinner plans. Lovely. None of the sit-down, service restaurants were taking even names for a waitlist, so Zoozacrackers was a heavensend.   One of our friend's orders got lost for a while, but other than that, the place is great. My chicken avocado sandwich was delish and wasn't as expensive as I would've expected for a place in the wynn."}
{"text":"We got only one item - the Chili Cheese Nachos. For under $10 I thought it might be the best value at the Wynn Hotel. I tried one bite and the cheese tasted like a Velvetta knock-off and the beef in the chili was barely discernable as meat. My son ate the rest and had the most horrific gas and god-awful smelling burps for the next 24 hours.  Poor thing had to be within 2 minutes of a bathroom the next day as well.  We all ate the same food with the one exception of the nachos, so the culprit had to be this crap.  I can't recommend this deli restaurant.  You may not pay as much at the cash register but you will pay on the back-end!"}
{"text":"Well, you just can't miss zoo-Za-CrackerS if you're in Wynn.  It's at the center of Wynn, 1st floor, in front of their box office.  I came in about 20 min. before catching the early evening show at Wynn, order the half, pastrami sandwich, the red matthattan chowder soup (GOOD!) they have on the menu along w/ a soda, it came to be like around $15, & get to sit down, have my meal deliever to me, watch some sports update, and still get to catch my show.  If you're thinking to find some quick bite, right-portion serving type of place (they server half/full sandwhich), zoo-Za-Cracker is not too bad!"}
{"text":"As far as Wynn dining options go, this is the best bang for your shiny, boughetto dollar! I'm all for a fancy dinner while on the strip, but I'll be damned if I'm shelling out $20 for a wilting wrap or coffee and pastries.  A cobb salad will only set you back about $9, and their munchies like wings and fries hover around fancy diner prices. Desserts seemed overpriced ($6 cheesecake and the like), so I wisely avoided.   Someone's gotta wear the pleather pants in the relationship (and look good doing so)."}
{"text":"The food is average at best.  I had chicken strips, fries and a coke. The chicken strips were no better or worse than pretty much any chicken strips you can buy at the grocery store.  Same goes for the fries.  The honey mustard was actually quite good. My wife had a chicken avocado melt sandwich and was not impressed. For the price we paid (over $40 for sandwich, chicken strips, fries and 2 soft drinks) the food deserves less stars. But, I will cut them some slack on prices because this is Vegas and everything on the strip is pricy. It is the quickest and most inexpensive option inside The Wynn."}
{"text":"Wayyyyyyyy overpriced.  I don't care if it's the Wynn. We're talking sandwiches for crying out loud. But the food was good. Loved the chicken noodle soup and the triple decker.  Fries are a bit greasy but delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch when I stayed at the Wynn over the Christmas holiday. It was quite chaotic when we first walked in. No one was there greet us or point us to where we should order and other patrons who walked in before and after us also seemed a little confused.  I had the 1/2 lb turkey burger. The burger was huge! It took me quite a while to finish it. For the price, I would have thought it would have came with fries, but I had to order that separately. Still definitely cheaper than eating at the buffet. The next time I am here, I will definitely try the pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"We are staying in the Encore and wanted a quick but tasty bite to eat. It was fast and the employees are very friendly, pretty much the standard here at Wynn!   We both ordered the Santa  Fe sourdough turkey melt, fries, and a drink. It was about $24 for the whole meal, so I had pretty high expectations needless to say. I will say large plus is that the drinks are refillable, so not bad especially with the Vegas heat and all the drinking. Haha   Overall the food was pretty good, AMAZING fries, not sure what they do but it works well! The sandwich comes with pepper jack cheese, I subbed for provolone. I will say if you don't mind pepper jack it would prolly be the better flavor option other than cheddar.   Looking forward to trying something else! It's a great casual spot to relax and eat, it overlooks the main casino"}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced, but what isn't in the Wynn?  For a deli the food was pretty fancy.  Their salads are served packed with goodies, finger foods are quality and the Manhattan Clam Chowder was excellent.  It's an order at the counter deli but they bring you your food and refills.  If you're looking for a quick bite to eat at the Wynn this is pretty much the only place but don't expect it to be cheap or fast. Just cheaper and faster to the other options."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a coffee, great ambience and style that's why I gave one star but coffee was no good definitely not my style total waste of money"}
{"text":"The best matza ball soup ever. The pastrami sandwich is great too. This is my favorite deli to visit. The food is great."}
{"text":"Two people from our part got sick from their tuna salad sandwich. I would never be able to eat here again. With the prices they charge this is so unacceptable."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work for couple of weeks and ended up eating here several times during my stay.    The staff were always friendly, helpful and super helpful.    I ordered (three different visits) NY Steak dinner - Steak was great!  The fries it came with weren't even touched as I only wanted the protein. Salmon Dinner - Delicious!  Came with baby tomatoes and green beans. Wynn Berger - Vegetarian burger with fries and chocolate shake.  Perfection!!!  They must have fixed issues from the past and everything was incredible!"}
{"text":"I don't have the words to describe the taste of a Vegan Cheeseburger on my palate.  Thank you Steve Wynn!  They had a vegan cheeseburger combo, called the Wynn Burger.  F'ing amazing.  Vegan patty, melted soy cheese, fries and a chocolate shake (yes, they were ALL vegan) for $9.  I would've paid $90 for the taste.  My wife got the Chopped Salad and she enjoyed it the most on our vacation.  Bonus points for having Diet Cream soda.  About the prices:  all Vegas strip hotels are expensive.  Unless you go to some dive, expect high prices at a strip hotel.  (ie. sodas were $4)"}
{"text":"Little sandwich, coffee shop located in the Wynn Casino.   Sometimes this place is open and sometimes its closed. Wynn is great, but sometimes its hard to find a place that is open besides the buffet at night time, just because that buffet line is cray cray! Ive ordered a sandwich here once and another time I ordered a bowl of soup. Not a bad little place and the prices are typical vegas prices. Nothing too special, but as for convenience it gets four stars."}
{"text":"when you're in Vegas and you're in the hotels, choices are multiples ,we  choose here because we were hungry and we didn't to spend a lot of money for lunch. I am glad to tell you guys, the food is very good and priced reasonable and you get semi good service, but you should know the noise level is really high."}
{"text":"Silly name but oh yum!    I wasn't feeling good so I suggested the Wynn deli, Zoozacrackers, where I could get chicken noodle soup.  We ordered that and a corned beef  reuben.    About halfway through my soup I was feeling better and dove into the delicious looking reuben...marble rye, stacked with corned beef, saurkraut, swiss & Russian dressing...it was grilled to perfection and tasted like heaven.  I'd most certainly go back.    It was about $20 for a soup and sandwich (no sides, no beverages) but hell what do you expect from a deli?  And a deli in a pricey Vegas hotel none-the-less..."}
{"text":"I came here after thinking to myself \"what a weird named restaurant...\" - the menu looked good so my friends and i decided to give it a try. I wouldn't say it was the most amazing food, but it was do-able.   I got the stuffed turkey burger with cranberry jam - I think this combination went well together, but again the flavors weren't out of this world. It was a croissant bread, shredded turkey, a stuffing patty and cranberry jam. My friends got the smoked salmon platter & the turkey burger, both of them said it was alright too. Now the ambiance was obviously a typical Vegas/casino kind of feel, drunk people walking all over the place and loudness - which didn't really bother me. There was  a good amount of tables and booths, all reserved for people of the restaurant (those 'reserved' tents really did throw me off ~ reserved for who!?). The booths felt a little cramped though & had this huge pillar in the middle so it was hard to sit comfortably.   Overall, It was a good restaurant, but I'm positive I won't be back there on my next trip to Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get something to eat when you are on the go. Overpriced? What do expect it is Vegas and in the Wynn. This restaurant is fairly priced compared to the other places at the Wynn or Encore. The Cobb salad is so good and the best I had in a long time. There was so much avocado, bacon, chicken, and eggs. It was probably a good size portion for two people. My bf had the bacon cheddar burger which was good too."}
{"text":"Super yummy warm chicken fajita wrap with fries and potato latkes on the side! My colleagues had other sorts of deli sandwiches that they also pronounced delicious. So satisfying, simple and hearty and a perfect lunch for travelers just getting into Vegas and the gorgeous Wynn hotel."}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite restaurant in Vegas. She prefers casual deli food and buffets to fancy places and this is the perfect place to grab a quick sandwich.  Prices are typical Vegas high, but not as bad as many other options on the strip in the big hotels. The food is fresh and high quality. The Reuben is my favorite, but the pastrami is really good too. Following after that on my list of favorites here is tuna and then turkey.  Nothing really in the way of service and sometimes even the order bar can move pretty slow, but if you just want a good sandwich and are confined to the strip up at the Wynn end of things, try this one."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place! It's always a for sure option for a great deli meal. I am in love with the Matzo ball soup and the Rueben sandwich is also a fave of mine. My friend and I always stay at Encore and make it a point to hit up Zooza. I had the manhattan clam chowder this past weekend and it too was amazing. I'm still the biggest fan of the matzo, but a girl has to branch out a bit!"}
{"text":"This place is on the cheaper side of Wynn, but I had the worst experience here during my vacation.  Dish: Chicken BLT At first I thought it was going to be chicken bacon, but when I got the dish, it was literally and piece of chicken and bacon! The bacon is too hard! I freaking CUT my upper GUM because the bacon was to damn hard!   Chicken Noo-dle soup: This soup is amazing. After my bacon incident I had to wait like 15 min unlit my gums finished bleeding out. (GROSS I know) I ended up taking all the bacon out and putting it into my soup to soften it up. (GREAT IDEA EVER) my soup tasted even better with the bacon in it!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and convenient.  Quality is not the best, but they have free refill on drinks."}
{"text":"I visit vegas about 2 times per year for the past 4 yrs, and every trip, I come here for the cob salad, b/c it has a good variety of items and plentiful.  3 weeks ago, when i visited this place and got my usual salad, its not half the size and same price.  whats the deal?"}
{"text":"Great food for reasonable price at Wynn. Chicken avocado sandwich and vegetarian sandwich were very well done. Fries crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat if you are in the mood for deli sandwiches. I recommend the club sandwich as its fresh with crispy bacon, turkey, lettuce and cheese. Make sure you put deli mustard on it. I don't recommend the pastrami. Stead clear."}
{"text":"What do you do if it's getting close to midnight and you still haven't had dinner because you've been sipping on margaritas in the lounge instead? One option is to head here for a quick nosh. I got the pastrami on rye (I felt the need to add the \"on rye\" when I ordered because I wasn't sure, being this is Vegas, if they might try to serve it on Wonder Bread), and while it's certainly not the best deli I had had, it will do in a pinch.  Get a table next to the wall if you want to people watch while you fress."}
{"text":"Expensive but tasty food. I paid $15 for a meal that I'd pay about $3 if I bought it at Costco. Service was nice though and it's right next to the Casino & Tryst :D"}
{"text":"I liked my Cobb salad from here (it was a bit pricey but it was huge) and I liked that they would track you down and bring you your food in the sportsbook even during the madness of the first weekend of the NCAA basketball tournament.  Pricewise, this is a steal in the Wynn especially when the salad costs less than the vodka soda you just ordered.  The line was really long but it actually moved quite quickly and a lot of the other menu options sounded like they'd be good."}
{"text":"If you want to overpay for a sandwich and you are too afraid to leave the hotel, it's fine.  Dear Mr Wynn. . . Please give me a shot to come in and try to increase sales at this restaurant.  It's such a great location with incredible potential."}
{"text":"Delicious quick food at the Encore! The staff was friendly and the food was much better than expected. They only serve beer- but they share a space with a full liquor bar :)"}
{"text":"I will call this a restaurant, not quick service or considered \"fast food\" at Wynn!   The reuben sandwich was awesome - the chef brines his own pastrami and corned beef! A must try!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy lunch stop at Wynn.  I ordered the {COBB SALAD} sans blue cheese. It was decent size salad that filled me up. The prices aren't cheap but reasonable compared to the options in the Wynn."}
{"text":"Just to confirm, as of today, Zoocrackers is closed.  The Wynn is renovating its sports book, promising that it will reopen in August of 2017.  There is no doubt that they will be on track so that they will be open for football season.  At this point, whether Zoocrackers will have the same menu, or if it will be replaced by a new restaurant is unknown.  In the meantime, it has served up decent deli.  The price point is a little high, but so are you if you think you are getting anything cheap at the Wynn.  Still, it's a lot more reasonable than anything else in the place."}
{"text":"Decent spot with decent food!  Yes, the prices are not cheap, but it is Vegas and the Wynn.  We enjoyed the breakfast sandwich, a biscuit with sausage and egg.  However, I especially liked the square hashbrowns that  came with the sandwich.  Yumm.  Much better than the breakfast sandwich at Snacks at Bellagio.  They Wynn OJ is sooo delicious, but pricey.  I think it was 4 dollars?!  But, as I am pregnant, it was worth every sip!  Love that it is adjacent to the Sportsbook.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Service was at a snail's pace. How long does it take to prepare a bowl of soup? And all for  \"only\" $25."}
{"text":"This deli is very unique. The ambiance is great and ideal for chatting. ZoozaCrackers is very commercial, but reminds me of The Carnegie Deli in NYC with a transplant like twist. The salads are much better than your average NYC deli. The sandwiches and deserts are good copycats of classic NYC staples. The only drawback is the high level of traffic!"}
{"text":"I was there on 4/3/17 and it is not closed yet.  Lucky for me.  The Rueben was delicious, though next time I will ask for extra kraut. They serve China Mist iced tea, which is my favorite. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Yes, it's expensive for a deli, but you're in Las Vegas--HELLOOOO!!! Just checked in (or in the casino or sportsbook), starving, can't think, and just need to eat? This is the place for you! Quick counter service. Quick getting-your-food service. Very spacious. You can sit anywhere, and it's actually quite nice and clean, a bit upscale for a deli, but I wouldn't expect less from the Wynn. The chicken avocado sandwich is decent and fresh, and the zooza burger is super juicy and delicious! Don't expect it to come with fries or chips though. For $14.99, that's a steal compared to all the other places to eat here at the Wynn!"}
{"text":"We wanted a fairly quick meal while we were staying at the Wynn. The Terrace Cafe is not remarkable, and prices are high. We decided to have an early lunch here. The sandwiches are large. You may want to share or do a 1/2 sandwich and soup. I had the Rueben, which was packed with meat. It was delicious.  My husband had the 1/2 Rueben and matzo ball soup. Said it was the best he ever had. Again, the soup was very large. Lots of food and not as expensive as other Vegas restaurants. Food can be split with a friend and you will still be satisfied."}
{"text":"Expensive to say the least. Portions were small and a la carte. Tortilla soup was too thick. The burger was good, but lacked kick that I need for $13."}
{"text":"I love Zoozacrackers  Deli.  Being  at the Wynn,  this place  is  not  cheap.  Sadly,  this  is  probably  the  cheapest eatery on the  Wynn  property.   But they  make  the best pastrami sandwich anywhere West  of New York  (that  award goes  to  Katz),  and  their  chicken  noodle  soup  is pretty darn delicious. There's  ample  seating in the  Deli  and  you  can  catch glimpses of a sports  game  at  the  Wynn  sports book next  door.   Two half  soup/sandwich  combos plus  two  soft  drinks  (refills  included)  was almost  $45."}
{"text":"Very high quality, while the price is high, it is worth it. For example you can taste the subtlety of the smoke on the pastrami which is rare to see.   Usually it is one or the other not here.  The matzo ball soup was excellent. The matzo was tender and very tasty. While I did not need the extra noodles it was a great soup.   Definitely worth the extra cost!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered from here once, and the Reuben was beyond terrible. I got it because  I generally like Reubens and the cashier suggested it, but I had to actually ask them to bring 1000 island dressing because there was maybe 1 drop on it. The sandwich was extremely bitter and horribly dressed. You also have to pay $2 to add cheese to your burger and you get no side for a $16 low quality meal."}
{"text":"Great place for a late night snack.  this is my second visit there.  Loved the burgers and sandwiches.  Can watch the sportsbook from the table.  A little expensive, but hey!!  It's Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place kicks it for a late feed bag.  Large portions and a accommodating chef.  Order at the bar and wait for your food to come to you.  The zoo zoo burger - meat piled with pastrami what else can I say.  Dalafs for a lighter appetite? Or perhaps a good old time deli sandwich - yes go with that you won't be disappointed.  After you stuff yourself go ahead and mosey out to machines a win. A few thousand dollars."}
{"text":"Meat is poor quality. Too expensive for what you get. Not terribly impressed here. Stay away for the steak quesadilla"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burgers in Vegas, the Zooza Burger, covered in delicious pastrami and cole slaw!  The Zooza eggs bene with pastrami is fabulous as well!  Side orders are just average and the line can build quickly as it is one of the earlier opening eateries in the casino.  I have to say the the extensive brass furnishing smell rusty and disgusting."}
{"text":"Is there a \"Less Than One Star\" rating for Zoozacrackers Deli?  Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich: Dry, Stale, Tasteless, Shaved Roast Beef, a few Limp, Tasteless Peppers, a few Limp, Tasteless,Onions, Pepperoncini,Two Tablespoons of White Cheddar Cheese Sauce, on a Stale, Grocery Store, Pseudo French Roll -  $16.21 including tax."}
{"text":"I'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars here. Can we settle on a 3.5?  Zoozacrackers is a fine-enough deli with a decent menu and reasonable prices. My folks had the matzo ball soup here for lunch at least 5 times during their stay and that soup was delicious and the portion, large. So that dish is a winner! They also had various sandwiches which they also liked. I had 2 different salads on 2 consecutive days. The veggies were fresh and crisp and the portions were large, but the first day, they messed up my order (wrong salad dressing, and on the salad, not on the side as requested). The second day, the salad was perfect.  If you're into desserts, their display features the BIGGEST and prettiest cakes I've seen in a long time! We didn't have any, preferring to save our appetites for dinner, but man, if you're going to splurge on calories, this'd be the place! I even took some photos of the dessert display, as the mile-high strawberry shortcake and the tall chocolate concoctions looked so amazing!   All in all, this is a good go-to deli and, if and when I return to Vegas, I'd definately come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"\"Z-Crackers\" is the only decently priced place in the Wynn... and decent by Wynn's standards ($14 for a sandwich).   I got a Chicken Avocado Sourdough Melt. Very good without the Hummus! All of the ingredients on the sandwich were good... toasted bread, melted jalapeno jack cheese, tomato, chicken!"}
{"text":"Good Deli food. Fresh and tasty soups, salads and sandwiches.  Service is pretty slow and the line gets long at lunch time.  But overall one of the best values for lunch.  We had the Manhattan Clam Clam chowder which had a great flavor and portion size was good.  The Tortilla soup was just ok.  And avoid the Wynn Burger Special.  Sounds good on paper, Veggie Burger, Fries and  Chocolate Shake for like $12.  But the burger was on an undelicious vegan bun had to send it back to get re-bunned with regular buns. lol."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for being a deli. Also pretty good prices considering it's Vegas. You can split a sandwich in half for 2 people (they're big) with soda for about $20."}
{"text":"Unsure why this place has decent reviews. As for my experience, not so great. Hubs and I both got the pastrami. We also got chips, a cookie for a dollar more, one soda and one coffee...bill=46!?!! What?? Would have been fine had this been the best sandwich of my life! Sandwich, dry dry dry, yuck! Pastrami should always be juicy. Also, bread is hard to chew. The pastrami has a smokey taste which was weird to me, hubs didn't mind that part. Save your money and walk across the street to the mall food court for a simple lunch or snack."}
{"text":"Great place everything is great love staying at Wynn because of zoozacrackers Best place to eat in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place serves its purpose-when you need to eat without straying too far from the casino, or while you're in the sportsbook.   They used to have an amazing Chili Cheese Fries! I know, it's a simple dish, but I'm a sucker for a good cheese sauce! It had a pond of cheese sauce and nearly a swamp full of chili. There were fries in there somewhere too. No more...=( The rest of the food is ok; nothing to write home about. Drinks (and here, I mean water, iced tea, soda, etc) are waaaay overpriced. I can get a Vodka rocks for the price of a tip only 5 short feet away...You want 5 bucks for water?!?!  I've been saying for years, hook up some food service in the casino, and I\"ll never leave..."}
{"text":"Im not impressed, well, not in a good way. The room is clean and looks fine. I liked th booths, very comfortable.  Service is friendly.  I had the driest, toughest pastrami sandwich ever. It was like trying to choke down sawdust, even after a liberal spread of mustard. Finally after a few bites, I went to the counter where you place your order to get a side of 1000 island dressing. It moistened the sandwich enough to eat but it was still awful pastrami. The sandwich was decent in size. Bread was nothing special. Very much not worth the price.   My bf ordered a chicken caesar salad. It didn't look very good to me and he said it wasn't very good.   one sandwich and one salad was $35 and it ranged from not very good to pretty damned  bad."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is very helpful in getting your order and bringing it to your table. My Reuben sandwich was a bit dry though. Other than that, it's a friendly place to get a quick meal before heading off to other activities."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by Zoozacrackers for lunch one afternoon during our stay at the Wynn. There are about 10-12 sandwich choices along with a handful of salad options. My wife opted for a chicken salad sandwich and I got the triple decker with roast beef and turkey with provolone. Talk about big...I was full after eating half of the sandwich and miserable after about two-thirds of it. My wife wasn't thrilled with the chicken salad - said it was too mayonnaise-y - but we happily polished off our fries.  For two sandwiches, an order of fries, and a soda the total was about $35. We agreed we'd go back, but she would order something different and I would order something smaller."}
{"text":"Price is high due to being inside the casino. I ordered the loaded nachos which is superb and the angus burger is not too bad but very small for $14. Atmosphere is very good, couches and big lounge chair make it very cool to impress wife. But must order first at the counter is kind of weird since the place looks high end but no service. So I guess no tips necessary."}
{"text":"Is this place in the Wynn-yes  Are the Wynn restaurants expensive- yes  Are the restaurants excellent with top notch quality- yes  So why would anyone think different of this deli?  The food is outstanding and as good or better than any deli. It does not matter what you order. Everything is really delicious  If you want to save money cut coupons and go to Subway or Denny's"}
{"text":"Oh boy, that was one hell of a burger. See my picture, it's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I'm split between 3 or 4 stars but I'm deciding to be nice.  Zoozacrackers is pretty solid deli with reasonable prices (at least for the Wynn). Stopped by recently after CES and was pleasantly surprised by the offerings here. Adjacent to the sports book, Zoo offers a great selection of sandwiches, salads, and soups. The deli is pretty casual, walk in, seat yourself, and order at the counter.   My Chicken Sourdough Melt was delicious. For once I could actually taste the provolone and the sourdough was not dry at all. The fries were fresh and crispy worth the additional $4. I know I was overpaying for the food but it was damn good.  Theres a huge dessert display case if you got a sweet tooth. For $13 you get a slice of the biggest cake I've ever seen. It can easily feed 3-4 people; diabetics be warned.  The Wynn Burger is their most popular dish. An all vegan cheese burger (I think the cheese is soy) along with a serving of fries and a small shake all for $9. This is easily the cheapest meal in the entire resort. Though the burger is pretty small, it tastes great and I can tell why its a favorite.   If you're hungry at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers is a great spot to catch a quick bite and not break the bank."}
{"text":"OMG!   It's a deli with delicious sandwiches yes.   But the chicken tortilla soup is to die for!   It's a little thicker than I expected but the flavor is absolutely devine!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options and the vegan chocolate shake is to die for!!! Also, prices are a bit better here and the location is fun because you can look out at everyone."}
{"text":"Matzo Soup - never disappoints!  Fast and friendly service!  Their pastrami sandwich and French fries are amazing also! Huge portions, enough to share!  Perfect cafe for a pick-me-up late lunch; mid-day; or post theatre!  Love it!"}
{"text":"So this deli is located in the Wynn hotel right next to the sports book.  When you walk in you go straight to the counter, order and then find a seat.  Typical deli sandwiches all priced around 12 bucks. There are salads and wraps available as well.  I ordered the Manhattan clam chowder ($6.99) and a side potato salad ($3.99) the soup was fine but not even worth the amount I paid.  It came with a bag of oyster crackers but my cousin got 2??? WTF. As for the potato salad,  well I just got 2 whole potatoes cut into 1/4 pieces.  So I had to recut them since my mouth isn't as big as a whale.  It had no taste, I had to add salt and pepper so it tasted like salted potatoes.  Don't bother wasting your money here, or time."}
{"text":"God Bless Steve Wynn for the vegan options at all of the restaurants at Wynn!  Our favorite comfort food option at Zoozacrackers at Wynn is the vegan cheeseburger/fries/chocolate milkshake combo which is just freaking yummy!  Definitely a must for every time we visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stop in just to grab a quick snack in between meals.....and they had a Cookie n Cream shake....enough said. Large please and it was awesome....."}
{"text":"3 solid stars for a good lunch place inside the Wynn Hotel.  Ordered the half sandwich (corned beef) and soup combo for $10.95 and if you want cheese, it's an extra buck. I also ordered the Diet cream soda for $4 and it wasn't very good.  The mushroom barley soup was fantastic. It tasted fresh and homemade. Not a bad start. The corned beef was light, not fatty, but very tasty. I loved the wheat sandwich bread.  I was tempted to order a slice of their displayed carrot cake, but I had to remind myself that I still have some holiday weight to burn.  Overall, it was a good lunch spot and I would rather eat here than the Wynn's buffet if I have known earlier."}
{"text":"Recently in Vegas for a conference by myself.  Didn't really want to spend alot to go out to eat  or go eat at fancy places by myself.  I was so grateful I found this gem in the Wynn, where the sandwiches were reasonably priced (for Vegas) and I could get them to go.  Did not have to wait long at all for my orders.  Had a reuben, which was amazing.  Very soft rye (I believe they make all their breads in house) and it was lightly grilled.  Perfect combo of corned beef, kraut, swiss, and 1000 island.  The best part was that it was NOT greasy at all.  Also tried the chicken club, which again was served on fantastic bread and was not greasy.    Can't wait to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a bite to eat at the Wynn without breaking the bank.  The Zooza burger with pastrami on it was quite filling to say the least."}
{"text":"New York deli???  hmmmm They may want to do a little research on that one. Seems they have a split personality there w a scattering of the typical boring southwest 'flair' or lack thereof. Have had many a lunch here and it's pricey for average food. Usually would get the Southwest chicken salad (see what i mean here?). The people who work the counter have been very friendly. Place seems to get packed because there really aren't many options @ Wynn, after a while everything pretty much tastes the same."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First, they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what, but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.  I walked up to the line that was somewhat long, but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the \"1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo\" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.  Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.  Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah.   I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back."}
{"text":"There aren't many places at the Wynn to grab a quick bite to eat other than the coffee shop across from the box office and Zoozacrackers, a counter service deli by the sports book. This is an upscale take on a deli, of course, where you'll find sandwiches that are a step up from typical delis. You'll also find some entrees, shakes, and desserts. The chicken avocado sourdough melt ($12.99) was impressive with large chicken breasts topped with avocado, hummus, jalapeño jack cheese and tomatoes. Fries were extra. Zoozacrackers is less expensive than other restaurants at the Wynn, but it isn't cheap. Dinner for three came out to over $45 for a sandwich, burger, and chicken tenders."}
{"text":"expensive.  1 star for the experience."}
{"text":"This place has the best Tuna Sandwich in Las Vegas! Yes... even better than Earl of Sandwich. They put it on sourdough and the tuna they use is fantastic. It may be a 9 dollar sandwich but hot damn its good! I even thought that their fries were tasty!  You can't miss this place, it's a deli style set up with tables to bring your numbers to.  Their lemonade is fantastic and it's right next to their sportsbook. You can even see the sportsbook screens from there and they have flat screens showing games too.  It's a tad on the pricey side but hey, you're staying at the Wynn, that should be expected."}
{"text":"Disappointing!  Another let down by Encore! Sandwiches were not huge like on the Wynn Channel. Flavor and service fell short. I do not recommend this place unless you want to stay close to the sports betting section.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst crap food ever!!!! Ordered two hotdogs and a grilled cheese....the hotdogs came on two pieces of sliced bread!!!! When they clearly are served on buns. I ordered one last night, it came with a bun. Nothing was mentioned when I was ordering. How difficult was your job to say \"We are out of buns.. and will be serving the hot dogs on sliced bread\"!!!Apparently too hard. And the grilled cheese advertised on the menu comes with a variety of ingredients , all I received was a plain cheese on 3 slices of bread, nothing else on the sandwich! This is what you receive at the Wynn."}
{"text":"With all the grandeur and beauty that is The Wynn, Zoozacrackers deli may serve my favorite meal on the entire strip at a price that makes dropping $150-200 on a room, in addition to whatever it is you may have lost on the tables/slots/sports book, look a lot more palatable.   For $11 (used to be $9) you get an entirely Vegan fast food meal experience. A Gardein patty on a pasty sesame seed bun, topped with American style \"cheese\". Be sure to ask for lettuce at no charge as it oddly doesn't come standard. If you're feeling frisky, you can top it with avocado for a reasonable (for Vegas) $1.50 more.  A side of tasty seasoned fries and a chocolate milkshake round out the meal. That coconut based choco-shake is a contender for the best Vegan chocolate shake in the world. Or maybe I was just craving something shake-like after being disappointed by Holstein's lack of a Vegan shake. Just be sure you know how to handle your chocolate before you down this bad boy. That sucker packs a wallop!  Is the Gardein patty cooked to perfection? No, not quite. It could use more flame broiling, less microwaving but it's still pretty good and the overall price is right. The pasty bun is pretty pasty tasting as well. However, for a \"cheap\" quick meal in The Wynn, get your ass to Zoozacrackers, conveniently located next to the sports book.  It must've been good enough that my sweetie risked filling herself up too much before our meal at Sinatra later that night by ordering another one after we finished the first one we shared for lunch.  Note: If you're a glutton for punishment, walk over to The Encore to receive the same meal for $6 more at the Society of Snakes Cafe..."}
{"text":"We just went to the Wynn and ate lunch at Zoozacrackers today.   Fantastic sandwich and soup !   We got the corned beef on a bun... and it was well worth the $ 12.  The Manhattan Clam Chowder was a perfect 10.  They shoot ...they score !    I'd go back there again for sure....   and... the people there were super nice.  We gave extra big tips, even though we ordered from the walk up counter.   GOOD."}
{"text":"Wow. What an awful meal that was. Staying At the Wynn so got buffalo wings and a French dip sandwich to go. Wings were good (carrots and celery tasted like last week but they are pretty unimportant) but the French dip might be the worst I ever had. Over cooked would be an understatement, shoe leather would be better. Tasted like it was cooked three days ago and reheated a few times. Absolutely awful!!!  Prices high but I expect that here but holy crap when I spend $35 at a deli it better be stellar. I'm from NY, trust me this was no NY deli, sad poser. Avoid at all costs if you have ever been to a good deli."}
{"text":"We came here during our recent stay at the Wynn for some late night dessert. They had these huge slices of cake in the display cases, so we figured between the four of us, we could easily polish one off. Now, when I saw huge, I am talking seven layers of cake and seven layers of frosting. Huge.  At $11.95 a slice, it was a little pricey. Because there were so many of us, we justified that it would have been more if we had purchased individual items on our own. So we went with it.  Upon ordering, we were greeted by a fellow named Dylan who was less than helpful. When we asked him questions about the menu, he just shook his head or muttered yes or no. Whatever. My friend asked for a glass of water, he ignored her. She asked again after the transaction, and he slammed it in front of her. Maybe it was us. Nope- the next group of people weren't from the US and were having a some trouble communicating their order. Did Dylan help? Nope. They asked a question about a sandwich and he just pointed to the menu and said, \"whatever's up there, is on it.\" Thanks guy- I'm sure that helped.  Now, only Dylan was less than pleasant. The other lady (who I interacted with while getting some drinks), Denise, was super friendly and helpful. She greeted people at the register, asked if we were having fun and thanked us for coming. Complete difference.  Now, I did take off a star for service (was going to take off more, but Denise was the saving factor)- but the rest of the stars were taken off because of how bad the cake was. We went with the Strawberry Shortcake version that was made with strawberries and white cake. The cake seriously tasted like it had be sitting in the fridge uncovered for quite some time or next to a macaroni salad. It definitely didn't taste like sweet cake- but something that should accompany a salad. I think it was sitting for too long next to too many different ingredients. It acted like a sponge for all the other flavors. Gross.  I guess the cakes in the display case are just for looks- such a bummer that something so beautiful tasted so rancid. For being the Wynn, I expected their standards to be a little higher in food and customer service."}
{"text":"Zoozacrackers, despite the unusual name, is the best deli in Vegas.  I think a lot of people dis this place because: the name sounds child like .... \"soda crackers\" ... what ???? the location makes it seem like part of the sports book .... it is located in a hotel with 6 or 7 extravagant restaurants ....  Why you should eat here - - The sandwiches are huge. The \"ton\" of french fries come in a large bowl. The soups are supurb The brownie is gigantic They serve bread and butter pickles with the Burger They have mock ups of what the sandwiches look like in the display case. You do not have to guess what your sandwich will look like ......  My first experience at the deli was eating a Chicken salad BLT.  It was just amazing. It was not only huge, it was superbly tasty. It was a difficult choice, the chicken over the burger, so I had to return a second time for the burger. The Zoozabuger is a meal in itself.  A huge hamburger with pastrami and cole slaw. The burger comes with garnish of lettuce, onion and tomato.   (enough to make a small salad) The real treat is a small dish of bread and butter pickles. They are as good as the ones my grandmother used to make. A dining treat.  I feel if Steve Wynn did not name this location for one of his friends and gave it one of the \"trendy\" deli names .... it would rank as one of the best, if not the best in Las Vegas. As a deli it matches, in it's own way, the quality of the fine dining experiences available in the Wynn. Like Steve Wynn says in his promotion  .... it is one of those whimsical experiences. Amazing"}
{"text":"Decent place with sandwiches, burgers and such. My bf wasn't impressed with his pastrami sandwich. It's just a very casual place. Overall, okay."}
{"text":"Obsessed with everything I had during my visit. The Reuben was so delicious- they don't skim on any of the ingredients. The matzah ball soup is THE BEST I have ever had. From la to New York, nothing beats the matzah balls here!"}
{"text":"way too expensive here, i know it's in a vegas hotel but just the price of a drink and chips is ridiculous"}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich.  I waited and waited.  Ten people who ordered after me got their order and I still waited.  Finally, I complained and the manager said \"oh we are rushing your order.\"  Obviously, they just forgot to make my order - or they didn't have the right ingredients which is what I suspect.  When I finally got my order of a veggie sandwich, it was pretty gross.  The manager said that the chef \"apologized.\"  But she offered nothing but a \"sorry.\"  Who has ever heard of a restaurant that screws up your order and then says \"sorry\" but makes no effort to make it right or to refund your money?  I will certainly never go back.  Everyone should know that if they screw up your food here, you'll get a \"sorry, too bad for you\" but your money will still be taken."}
{"text":"I drop by this place every time I come to Vegas. The vegan burger comes with a chocolate shake and fries. It's definitely not a gourmet meal, but more like something you would get at McDonald's. Being vegan, it's comfort food."}
{"text":"I wanted something to take back to the room to eat.   After checking the Wynn website for casual dining, I saw the Deli.  We had passed it earlier when we had taken a spin around the casino .  I walked down to the deli, ordered The Beef Dip to go with no oinions.  While I waited, I took a seat and ordered a drink at the Sportsbook which is a lounge that shares a bar with the deli. The drink was 10$ plus tax and tip. Hmm not impressed.  I was done the drink fast, I waited for my food, fiinally it came. I left.  Got up to my room. I open the box. It was the beef on a bun, some melted cheese, a pickle and the dip. That's it . That's all. Booooring !  The taste wasn't much better. It was dry. I ate half, threw the rest out.   Skip it, save money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick bite before and after Le Reve. Ordered 2 hotdogs, veggie sandwich with avocado and alfalfa sprouts, chicken salad sandwich and a hamburger. The hotdogs came with a huge sliced of very fresh and yummy watermelon.  This is a simple, not fancy, but overall good quality deli."}
{"text":"A fine place to grab a meal. Nothing too fancy or incredible.  The beef dip is good, as are the burgers and manhattan clam chowder.  The price/size of the fries is just silly - but all that is to be expected at the Wynn.  The smoked salmon platter was nice too.   The service is a bit funny, our table had 4 beef dips 2 were served with au jus, 2 were not - one had onions on only half the sandwich. Folks seemed a bit confused.   A fine place for a $20 meal at the Wynn."}
{"text":"Overpriced deli if I ever saw one, but it's inside the Wynn, so what do you expect.  I only had the matzo ball soup -- giant matzo ball, and very good.  But I don't know if it should have been $8.  Inside the Wynn, though, that's a friggin' bargain!"}
{"text":"With so many great places to eat at the Wynn, this place is one of the greats. I love burgers far more than steak. With that being  said, the Zooza burger rates in my top ten favorite burgers in Vegas. Willing to pay good money for a great burger!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings were on point! Definitely get those. As was their pastrami sandwich. Everything else was mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"I had a much memorable experience the last time I was here, so I was sad to drop a star on this visit.  Buttermilk pancakes are wonderful.  The bacon changed? Used to be thick smoked peppery slices and now they have these thin cheap slices.  What happened? Maybe they just ran out?  Chef...please...quality control! This is the Wynn not Denny's...act like it.  Atmosphere was nice, you could sit wherever you like.  Order at the counter, they give you a number and bring out your breakfast.  Eggs benedict were overdone, egg was overcooked like a hard boiled egg. Disappointing, especially on Father's Day?  Despite the overdone eggs this plate had great flavors, combining Russian dressing with pastrami and potato latke for a base instead of an English Muffin.   For kids just get one order of pancakes there are three in a serving and its enough for two kids under the age of 9 to share.   Service was average, did not come around asking for refills until the very end so that was a downer.  Also, keep in mind this place is closed July 4th!  I'm still going to come back and hopefully they will make some improvements like bringing back the real bacon and not some Oscar Meyer stuff!"}
{"text":"Your rating just lost 2 stars off the bat because of poor customer service.  I'm sorry if I ordered too slow for you, Miss, but I've never been here before and I couldn't make up my mind within 2 seconds.  Ever tried to make a recommendation or at least tell me to step aside if I wasn't ready yet?  Probably not.  And fyi - you banging the number stand thingy like a gavel and you looking like a pissed off monster won't make me go faster.  Or did you think I was deaf or blind to not see or hear you do it? There wasn't even that many people in line (just me and my two friends) so I'm not quite sure what your problem was.    I got the tuna salad sandwich and it was just ok -  a scoop of tuna salad between two pieces of bread (not toasted, sort of stale around the edges and no lettuce or tomato)... kind of a disappointment.  I loved the pickle, though, very crispy - it was the highlight of my entire meal! And I got fries. That was about it.  My friend got a great recommendation from her cashier: the avocado wrap but on sourdough toast and blackened chicken added."}
{"text":"My husband and I popped into Zoozacrackers before seeing a show at the Wynn. We had limited time before the show, and we were looking for a fairly quick and simple meal.   At Zoozacrackers, you place your order and pay and then your meal is brought out to you.  There is not a lot of seating, and the entire area is loud due to it's proximity to the sports book. Don't be a douche and sit down before you order. There are signs on tables stating to order first and employees WILL tell you to move if you do not obey the signs. We saw this happen 4 times in about a 45 minute time period.   Like everything at the Wynn, this place is rather pricey ($11-15 for a burger or sandwich).  The food is just ok, nothing was exceptional at all.   In the future, I would prefer to spend a little more for a better meal at another establishment at the Wynn. But for those in a hurry, willing to spend the money, Zoozacrackers Deli is an okay option."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 3.5, I would.   The food was decent ( the prices were steep) and the service was average. We had a group of 8 and it took nearly 20 minutes for everyone to have their food. The last person didn't receive her food until 25 mins later because the cashier forgot to put a number on her order.   There is plenty of seating available. This place would have been quiet and relaxing if it wasn't located next to the jumbo-tron with sports on it."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were not very good at all. For the price they charge I would expect something better than Subway. But Subway beat them. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"This deli is buried deep in the heart of the Wynn so you'll have to navigate a slot machine jungle to find it.  For $15 (that's like a Canadian penny in Wynn money) you get a clear view of the sportsbook -  this place is great during the NFL season - and your choice of the regular deli fare, burgers, sandwiches, large salads.    My favorite is the huge Cobb salad.  It's a monster, and always fresh.    The people watching here is rich and varied.  Since the Wynn is so central, there are plenty of places to walk off your meal - the Fashion Show Mall, Palazzo, Mirage are all within striking distance.   Location, food, sports - Zooza is the Trifecta of Strip delis."}
{"text":"I came here before going to see Garth Brooks just to get a quick snack, and really enjoyed what we got!  We ordered chicken wings and potato slices (which are very similar to potato skins). The chicken wings were nice and spicy, believe you me they had a big kick to 'em! Then there was the potatoes, they were THE BOMB! A whole potato cut in about 1/3 inch thick rounds, fried individually and then topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, and sour cream.   I'm sure you're thinking what's so good about chicken wings and potato skins, right? These were above and beyond the norm! The price for our appetizers were average, and they didn't take long to serve us either considering the large crowd.  I would definitely come back here again and perhaps try their breakfast or lunch/dinner entrees."}
{"text":"Food was okay but really overpriced.  For dinner, I ordered a half Reuben & Matzo ball soup... it cost almost $20 o_O  Granted, I also got way too much food; they basically give you a FULL bowl of soup when you sub in the Matzo ball soup.  But still, it just wasn't good enough to warrant spending that much money on a regular soup & sandwich combo (no drink included!)  Service was also kind of bad... just slow, confused, and not particularly friendly or helpful.  It took a long time for us to get our food, and they kept bringing us the wrong order.  The sandwiches are quite large so I recommend sharing if you aren't super hungry.  The Reuben was tasty, but the Matzo ball soup was just mediocre.  ZoozaCrackers is probably the only cheap and quick dining option inside the Wynn; however, it's nothing to go out of  your way for.  Earl of Sandwich is better and cheaper (though smaller portions).  Even if I were staying at the Wynn, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I really liked it. Got the nachos and a tuna sandwich. Good value for being in a casino. Soup looks good and the drinks are abundant. Enjoy for a quick sandwich or salad."}
{"text":"i LOVEEE the soup here! i've had the manhattan clam chowder and the mushroom beef barley soup and they were great. the sandwiches are good too...a place to go when you're looking for simple quick food at a decent price (well for vegas standards)"}
{"text":"When I used to live in Vegas or need a good quality sandwich after a night at the tables or XS I would stop for some take out. My favorite item is the chicken salad sandwich with chopped red onion. Fresh as it gets anytime you want it they are open. So if you need a quick bite on the run or take to the room go here."}
{"text":"Zoozacrackers is one of the entry-level restaurants at Wynn. Tucked into the sports book, and being more self-serve, it won't wow most people for ambience. If you're looking for a great deli sandwich, burger or other more casual fare, though, it's the best restaurant in the Wynn.  I had a half corned beef sandwich and a bowl of matzoh ball soup that were better than any NYC deli that I've ever been to.  Most of my party ate burgers or sandwiches, and all were impressed with the overall quality of the food.  Full bar in the book or you can get beer from the counter.  Downside is that it is next to the sports book, and across from the casino in open air, so it can be smoky. Other than that, it is a nice staple restaurant for those looking for a $10-15 meal in a hotel where the snacks in the gift shop set you back $8.50 or more."}
{"text":"Overpriced (duhhh...it's the Wynn) deli. All the usual suspects in deli-style sandwiches, for around $12 each (fries/side not included).  The gem here is the vegan burger! For $9 you basically get a vegan Happy Meal: a little gardein \"cheese\"burger that tastes/looks just like those little McDonald's burgers, a side of French fries, and a little chocolate shake. It's a filling meal, and alllll vegan....which is great for me, because I looooove me some milkshakes, but my inability to digest lactose normally makes them an ugly proposition!!!  It's not really gourmet foodie-food....but it's solidly good, for being vegan -- and the price is great. I will probably have this again!"}
{"text":"This deli, inside the Wynn casino and resort, is expectedly overpriced. That being said, it's not nearly as expensive as it could be, and the meal I had was delicious.  I ordered the soup + half sandwich, and opted for the chicken tortilla soup and chicken salad sandwich. For $13 I wasn't complaining, and the portion was HUGE.  The soup was the star of the show; it was sooo tasty, thick and filling. The sandwich was yummy as well. I'd never had chicken salad prepared this way, and I really enjoyed it.  Overall Zoozacrackers (ugh rename yourself!) is a great option if you're already in the Wynn and looking to keep your savings account untouched. But do be aware that the line does get pretty long during lunchtime."}
{"text":"Visited on 4-1-11 for lunch:  awesome matzo ball soup!!  Vegan veg sandwich was delicious.  Carved turkey sandwich was excellent. All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  Sports events are on the TVs in the deli while you dine. Well done!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. The food is good but typically the service is extremely slow. I would probably go more often but hate the thought of knowing I have to wait in line 10 or 15 minutes to place order and then another 15 or 20 minutes to  get food."}
{"text":"I love biscuits and gravy, so I was extremely excited when I saw it on the breakfast menu. Unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed once my food arived. While the fried eggs were good, the biscuits were tough, the gravy was bland, and they arrived luke-warm.  The place was clean and the deli line moved quickly. The food could have been out quicker, but as it was a Sunday morning during football season, I am attributing the wait to that.  Bottom line: if you are here for breakfast, don't order the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"I came here with the family before seeing Garth Brooks for my mom's birthday. We wanted something quick and easy that provided Veg options (thanks to Steve Wynn, we don't need to worry about that anymore). The deli is close both to the theaters, as well as the sports book. The line moved pretty quickly, but the food took forever. I am glad that we had about 1.5 hours before the show started when we arrived. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food.   The prices are substantial, as it is a deli inside the Wynn. However, I found the food to be very good. I had the matzo ball soup (a bargain for around $6.50). It was a very large bowl of very flavorful soup with very nice size matzo balls. I was very impressed. It was also quite filling, more so than my wife's veggie sandwich and fries.  My parent's and brother were satisfied with their food...other than the prices, as my parents are a bit thrifty.   If you find yourself in need of food at the Wynn, this is probably your cheapest bet."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Wynn in late March '09 and went to ZooZa Crackers twice to pick up take-out dinners.  Long wait especially after 8:00 p.m. but courteous and friendly service.  We don't really have a good deli in Honolulu so we were craving for the matzo ball soup ($6.95) and pastrami sandwich ($10.95) .... and ZooZa Crackers did not disappoint!  I had meatloaf ($14.95) one evening and really liked it.  My only criticism is although it was a generous portion of meatloaf, it only came with mashed potatoes --- no side veggies.   Next time we stay at the Wynn, I wouldn't hesitate to go back to ZooZa Crackers.  Good comfort food at a convenient location!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars (rounded down)  good service and really organized. If you haven't placed your order yet, then pack it up and get out of the table.....they made sure that people who ordered their food first had a place to sit, and made a few people get up since they were saving the table while their friends waited in line.  We ordered a 1/2 sandwich/soup (roast beef and mushroom barley soup) and an angus burger w/ american cheese and fries.  The sandwich was ok, soup was ok. Soup was a pretty big portion Burger was good, except I ordered it \"medium\" for once.....it came out extra well done....even a little too well done for my taste. Also, usually for a $12 burger.....you'd expect fries. not here....u want fries, order them separately.  If you want a burger....save some money and head over to Fatburger up the street."}
{"text":"Just stopped for a drink before a show & the selection was decent but I expected more from the Wynn. Our service was good but we also didn't get any food. They did have baseball on the TV so it's a pretty chill joint."}
{"text":"Deli counter style food - place your order, take your number back to your table, and they bring out your food when it's done. My tuna sandwich was perfectly adequate, nothing special.  Tons of comfy seating, connected to the Wynn Sports Book so there are TVs you can watch, and the service is pretty fast. Prices were a high for my liking but I guess I'd expect that at The Wynn."}
{"text":"One of the easy, quick bites, dont-feel-so-goddamn-broke-feeling eating places at the Wynn. Truth be told, I'll probably step out into the strip before coming here again. The food was very mediocre, and when I asked my friends how their food were... The answer was a very unimpressive \"It's alright.\" We got the buffalo wings, chicken tortilla soup, matzo soup, Philly cheese steak, and the pastrami hash. The place was clean, service was great.  That's it."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Las Vegas, I have to visit ZoozaCrackers Deli for one of their corn beef reuben sandwiches.  Deli food cannot get any better than Zooza.  I have been there 3 times and my food has been tasty, fresh, hot and succulent.  It is slightly pricey, but thats Wynn Las Vegas.   I highly recommend Zooza for anyone looking for a quick delicious fix."}
{"text":"Since matzo ball soup is the secret to my remarkable brain power and sexiness, I am a deli snob.  My favorites are Junior's in West L.A. and Brent's in the Valley.  I don't mess around with that Canter's or Jerry's crap.    I was persuaded to try Zoozacrackers by my husband, who is more forgiving and less snobby when it comes to delis.  I grudgingly agreed...and was impressed!  The food was fantastically fresh and well-prepared--no wilted lettuce, no tinny flavor in the soup.  The mushroom barley soup and the matzo ball soup were soooooo delicious.  The turkey sandwich was straightforward and yummy, especially smeared with Beaver mustard, which is found on every table.  We left refreshed and fortified for the long drive back to L.A.  Good show, Zoozacrackers!"}
{"text":"I usually dislike restaurants where you pay then find a seat but this one is OK.  Their chicken noodles soup isn't bad and their chicken nachos are OK, although I barely found any chicken in it.  It was quick and efficient if you're not looking to spend a lot of time sitting around eating or waiting for food."}
{"text":"Is it okay to drool at a picture? Just looking at the food on yelp makes me want to go to LV and grab a good bite or two here (and party the night away-it is vegas). burgers? sandwich? they are all good. I usually get sandwich and soup. the bf get burger and fries. the nacho fries/chip (or something like.. fried potato with cheese and etc.) not so good, too salty. Everything else good."}
{"text":"Fries and Mac and cheese here are delicious. Chicken tenders are good and nachos were not bad. The big chunks of chicken in the nachos were a bit strange, but everything else about the nachos was good. I like that it's more of a fast food style kind of thing. It did take a bit long to get the food, but everything I ate there was tasty- I went there 2 days in a row so I guess that says something."}
{"text":"This is av ery convenient spot for Wynn guests. My husband ordered a cheeseburger with a side of fries. My son had the hot dog and bacon mac n cheese. They really liked it.   *They do not take phone orders for people who aren't guests of the hotel.  The Turkey Reuben $15 was horribly good and moist."}
{"text":"I came back again for the Zoozaburger and it really wasn't as good as I remembered. The patty was burnt and there was not enough Russian sauce. I finished the burger mostly on the strength of how it reminded me of the positive impression of my first burger here. I would say this is still a good place for a casual meal in Vegas and that the burger is still decent. However, definitely order it medium with extra Russian sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Got the club here. It was a little dry for my liking. Too much bread too-- whose mouth is actually large enough to take a bite out of that? lol. The bacon was on point though!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite! Nice service and fresh food.   Prices are reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas back in January, so I'm a bit overdue!   A group of us stopped at Zoozacrackers for a quick dinner before a show at the Wynn. For Vegas, the pricing was rather reasonable, and we quickly discovered that there was almost too much food! So we definitely got our money's worth, which is always appreciated.  It's a typical little deli, with a few sandwich combinations I'd never heard of but all sounded delicious. The food came quickly, was perfectly prepared, and tasted so yummy, I was very impressed! The French fries were my favorite! Wait, scratch that. The milkshake was quite fabulous as well. I would definitely eat here again to save a penny!"}
{"text":"Moderate lines but good service and good food (but not necessarily good value) are what earn Zoozacrackers four stars. I throroughly enjoyed my Pastrami club and still haven't found a pastrami sandwhich that beats theirs, although some have come close. I haven't been here in about two years so I'm not sure if much has changed but I can say that it is a good deli place where I'd recommend a visit to if you're not in to getting a humongous buffet mealing or dropping a cool few hundred bucks at Daniel Boloud's Brasserie"}
{"text":"The vegan Cheeseburger, fries, and milkshake meal was incredible. It wasn't just good for vegan food, it was DELICIOUS.  Everyone was very friendly and well informed about the menu.  The reasonable price and wonderful food means we will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas. Totally craving it now...."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to the pastrami sandwich when we saw it on the menu. What a let down, I've had tastier pastrami elsewhere. My gf hates mustard but added it and said it was better. Binion's is better and costs less also NYNY has a good sandwich at their deli."}
{"text":"My colleagues would laugh if they found out I was reviewing this simple quick lunch spot. However, my boss lives for the matzo ball soup at this place. We almost always stay at the Wynn when in town for business and she gets the soup here as soon as she gets off the plane. We always make fun of her. There are so many options and of all things she craves matzo ball soup when in Vegas.   They have some odd menu items here. I can't figure out there aim. From hot dogs and hamburgers to matzo ball soup to cheesecake. I guess they are a deli but the options are interesting with a nice twist. I had this sandwich that was like a club but had sliced hotdogs instead of deli meat. It was soo good, however weird it might sounds. This place has good food for a quick lunch spot. The salads look fresh and good. It's not cheap but nothing in the Wynn is so it's as good as you can expect."}
{"text":"Zoozahcrackets  now serving breakfast on the weekends. I ordered the hash. This was not hash - hash is potatoes onions and chopped meat. This was chopped pastrami with cheese on top thrown in a bowl topped with poached eggs. This could be so much better. For $16.00 bucks this should be so much better- like real hash and not in a serving bowl"}
{"text":"I had the Avocado Melt w/ mushrooms for $10.95.  All my friends thought I was nuts cuz there was no meat.  Whatevs, avocado is soo good.  Basically became vegetarian that night.  I must say, its not too bad.  LOL.  Great service, nice chilling booths, and good company.  All I need."}
{"text":"Never have I been so disappointed with service at the Wynn/Encore. Came here this past weekend with a group of girlfriends and stopped by at Zooza's for a quick lunch. I had adored the Cobb salad (which was a decent size - I had no problem with it). However, two of my friends ordered the chicken Caesar salad, the chicken in both entrees could not be anymore different. One of the orders had chicken which was not cooked all the way. The manager came to the table and swore that it was the way the chicken was marinated, yet the other salad did not have the same \"marination\". The manager also had the audacity to charge more for a replacement meal (which was in fact cheaper). I would definitely recommend getting your food to go as the service is not up to par."}
{"text":"Très bon resto les plats sont assez copieux, je regrette juste que l'accompagnement ne soit pas compris dans le prix du plat et cela fait vite monter la note... Nous avons testé le sandwich au poulet et le wrap ! Cadre plutôt agréable ! On peut regarder les autres jouer aux machines a sous ! A conseiller"}
{"text":"Love this little deli shop in The Wynn hotel. Prices are decent (for The Wynn); but pls don't expect cheap here.  Must try the New England claim chowder in a bread bowl (extra $2) and the prime rib dip (sandwich). You order up front but they will bring the food to you. The wait was not long at all, and the ease of ordering the food and getting it was a no-hassel.  I will for sure be back the next time I'm at The Wynn."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick lunch and next to the Sports Book Section.  TV's all around, comfy booths and breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"Good food and good service! I ordered the Caesar Salad without chicken and it was just perfect. Beware the portions are on the large size."}
{"text":"Great deli next to the sports book to pick up a quick bite to bring back to your room.  They've got seating available, but it's open to the casino, and that means cigarette/cigar smoke.    I recommend the chicken salad BLT, which is big enough for two, especially if you have indulged yourself with room service for breakfast and ate not only your own breakfast wrap, but also a large portion of your wife's French toast.  Did I say too much?"}
{"text":"I'm attending a conference that has a 3-day event at the Encore and need a quick place to grab lunch. This is the least expensive place I found and I enjoyed the food. The chicken tortillas soup has good flavors, but is more of a strew than soup. The portions are good sized- a half soup and half salad was almost too much. Sadly, everything is a la cart, so if you want fries, it's extra. The half & half with a soda was just over $20."}
{"text":"I Love the very chiLL feeL about this pLace. PLace your orders at the register area, grab your number, and an empLoyee wiLL deLiver your food tabLeside.  Since we came here just to catch up with a friend and were deciding to have dinner not too Long after, we opted to snack.  What caught my eye was the Loaded nachos and since I was unabLe to try MargaritaviLLe's nachos (which came HIGHLY recommended) I thought this couLd heLp fiLL that void.....  W R O N G. Sure the pLate may have Looked nice but thats aLL that it's good for. Zoozacrackers absoLuteLy skimps on the toppings. They kind of just sprinkLed the peppers and ground beef on top and the rest was straight cheese. Boooooooo!!!!  ALL in aLL, I may come back for a few other items but don't waste your money, time, & caLories on their nachos."}
{"text":"Ate here late in the afternoon today. The vegan burger was pretty good, but small. Vegeway has a way better vegan burger for like $5... or $9 for a combo. Fries and onion rings were decent. Shake was ok. The restaurant was pretty messy. The girl working the cash register was really nice."}
{"text":"Quick and decent to-go food. Way above what you should have to pay for a burger/sandwich/etc ($15-$20) but it's way cheaper than everything else around, so if you're in a bind for time, stop by and this will at least hit the spot (an expensive spot)."}
{"text":"Not bad for deli food. Located in the Wynn Casino, next to the sports bet. My husband and I split the triple decker club...nothing special...typical club sandwich. Also, had the fries, seasoned and hot. There is no sit down service, you order at the front of the restaurant, and they deliver it to your table."}
{"text":"Since we often stay at the Wynn Hotel, we frequent Zoozacrackers for the ease of getting something good to eat without breaking the wallet.   I've been here many times and tried many of the sandwiches, soups and burgers and have really never been disappointed. On my last visit, I had the Matzo ball soup and it was by far the BIGGEST MATZO BALL I have ever seen in my life. I almost never leave any food on my plate, but even this was too much for me to finish. It had great flavor and the chicken noodle soup was good. I also got a side of potato salad and it was AMAZING (they use deli mustard and red potatoes).   On our last visit, I was a little upset because my Dad ordered a BLT. The order taker then asked, \"the BLT or the Chicken BLT?\" He said again, the regular \"BLT\" and my brother ordered the same thing. What comes to our table??? Yup, the CHICKEN BLT. The chicken was so dry that they had to take it out of their sandwich.   Also, my mom ordered the \"clam chowder.\" Now, unless otherwise stated, most would think that this would be the white clam chowder served at most places. When it came to our table, it was the RED version."}
{"text":"I came here because LV Weekly touts the pastrami as one of the Valley's best sandwiches.  So, I had the pastrami plain on rye with deli mustard.  It was a good pastrami, but not great.  I think the pastrami at Carnegie at Mirage is better.  The strawberry shortcake is huge and $12 a slice.  This too was underwhelming.    The best thing about the meal was the french fries.  This should not be the case at a deli.  I will not be returning.  I wanted to try the lemonade, but it was $5.50 and did not come with refills.  I know this is the strip, and the Wynn, but that's crazy to me.  It's lemonade.  If you are charging nearly $6 for a glass, give refills, or make them 32 ounce glasses.  Your call."}
{"text":"5/5 Food & Quality, 5/5 Service, 5/5 experience.  Snapshot:  Don't let the name fool you, Zooza is a one of the best deli's. It's a staple each time I come to Vegas. Positioned adjacent from the sports book, this deli offers a wide variety of breads to form your ideal sandwich.  When was the last time someone asked you if you have any food allergies, it's just part of the staff ensuring you enjoy your food experience.  The chicken soup tastes like my grandmothers which is amazing.  They warm turkey sandwich on rye toasted is out of this world.  You really can't go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Cafeteria-like but nicer.  Right next to casino equals excellent people-watching.    Food: Canned Nachos:  I call it that cause almost all the toppings came out of a can.  Canned cheese,  canned chili & beans, canned tomatoes.  For being in the Wynn/Encore hotels, PLEASE make nachos with fresh ingredients!?  Cobb salad: Good.  Service: You stand in line to order and pay, then food is brought to your numbered table.  Overall: There's A LOT more (and better) places to eat at in the hotel.  This was sort of a last-minute decision, and our first day in the hotel, so we didn't know any better."}
{"text":"This was the closes place where my friends and I could come to for a light quick meal, but it doesn't come cheap, but that shouldn't surprise anyone staying or visiting the Wynn/Encore resorts. You order like any other restaurant here, at the counter, they give you a number, you find a seat and they bring it to you. I tried two different things here on my stay in Vegas, first was the Chicken Noodle Soup, the bowl isn't exactly big, almost the size of a campbells or progresso can. The soup is no different than a can soup, salty, but it was piping hot, not bad, but at $5.99, might be best to look somewhere else. I ordered a cobb salad...lol ya a freaking salad, but it had chicken and bacon, so meh, it was pretty good, expensive for a salad, but like I stated earlier, everything is expensive at the Wynn."}
{"text":"3.5 stars spot!   You know... you really can't go wrong at the Wynn. Everything is super pretty, nice and classy!  Even this quick spot for food is actually cool.   If you're looking for something quick to grab for lunch I would actually recommend it.  Terrace point cafe were closed at 3pm, country club had only their lounge menu which is extremely small and that's how I found myself here!   These are the things I liked:  1. The staff is super super friendly and professional! 2. The food was good!  I took the chicken csr wrap which wasn't as big as I thought but was still yummy.  Their French fries are literally heaven made! Super yummy, crunchy and golden!  3. It might sound weird, but Their booths are like vacation for your behind! So comfy!   My only problem was that this place as I expected is quite expensive.  Definitely not would be my first choice here at the Wynn but this place is a great option for those who are looking for a quick bite, especially after the pool party!"}
{"text":"Good option if you are in the sports book at the Wynn.  They'll bring your order over to where ever you are sitting.  I've had the veggie sandwich as a wrap, with grilled mushrooms, marinated onions, avocado, and hummus.  All of their soups are good too.   They have a Vegan menu on request as well."}
{"text":"Nice casual place to wind down or have dinner. They are not open late which is a bummer. I had their riblets which was drenched in sweet bbq sauce. The slaw is tasty but too wet. Fries were evenly cooked. The corn bread that came with the dinner wasn't that good. Miss a bit of corn flavor in it. Nice people to people watch."}
{"text":"Very fast service to the long lines. Good grab and go or sit down place. Nothing fancy on the menu, just tasty and does the job!"}
{"text":"This gets lumped into one since they serve the food in the sports book  Good - Buffalo Wings, Potato Skins, Burger  Weird - the turkey wrap with coleslaw and the Turkey Cranberry sandwich  The presentation was nice but they tried to be too fancy on some things that made the food taste not that great.  They try to do too much  The wait for lunch was also really long.  We waited about a half hour just for a sandwich and wrap."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come to Vegas, which is every other month, this is my go to.   Its one of those places where you can't really go wronf with anything on the menu. The employees are great, and the manager runs a tight ship so everything is always very clean and tidy.  I cant say enough about the staff and how friendly they are.  Great food, great atmosphere ( inside Wynn Casino next to sports book)  Watch the game, have a sandwhich, everybody is happy:)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for food that's reasonably priced in the Wynn, this is about your only choice. It's located next to the sports book area. I ordered a chicken and avocado sandwich which was pretty bare bones. It came with a crispy pickle. If you want a side, you have to pay extra for it. I will say the sandwich was tasty but not $12.99 tasty. It is the Las Vegas strip after all, so you'll be paying a lot for everything.  You order at the front and then they bring it to you. Seat yourself. If you are in a rush and you're looking for no frills, Zoozacrackers will have to do. If you want something more extravagant, I'm sure you'll find it.   I paid just under $20 for a sandwich and a ginger ale."}
{"text":"Convenient location in the Wynn, but food is just mediocre. Cobb salad was great (although it had too much dressing) but tuna sandwich and tortilla soup were not very good.  Order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table. Very limited drink menu."}
{"text":"So I'm still mad they don't show basketball during march madness and their drinks are still the most STUPIDLY overpriced drinks in this city ($4 for a soda? still the stupid dixie cup tap water policy), however I'm so obsessed with their deli stuff I eat here every few weeks. So it's only fair I bump up the stars.   For lunch I get the half sandwich + matzo ball soup. With all the upgrades (cheese, matzo) I pay $14ish with tax. It's honestly worth every penny to me and a killer deal for those staying at the Wynn with limited high quality cheap-ish options.   I get the pastrami on rye. I normally hate pastrami and find it fatty and gross. Zoozacracker's pastrami is incredible. The meat is beautiful and has the best flavor to it. It's served warm and I like to get provolone  melted all over it. YUM. A half sandwich is a manageable size and isn't some sick gluttonous meat fest like you get at Carnegie. The meat, cheese, bread ratio is perfect. I add deli mustard of course !  The matzo is freaking amazing. A softball sized matzo and huge bowl of broth and chickeny goodness will definitely fill you up. When I get this combo of sandwich + soup I have yet to finish both, but that doesn't stop me from trying!!"}
{"text":"For the price, I expected way better. Had a turkey burger, fries and a drink for almost 30 bucks. My burger was dry and lacked flavor. Service was slow. Won't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Zoozacrackers Deli inside the Wynn was the most feasible option for a dinner date before catching Le Reve because we only had 45 minutes to spare and Zoozacrackers is just a stone's throw away from the Wynn theater.   WYNN BURGER ($11): The entire meal is vegan. Literally the exact same menu option is offered at Society Cafe inside Encore for the same price, but with poorer presentation here (plastic cups instead of glass, etc.). This meal is the cheapest option on the menu because it comes with a chocolate milk shake and fries. Everything else on the menu is served a la carte. I asked for lettuce on my burger and they obliged. I happen to like the chocolate shake but my husband begged to differ. Smh. 3/5 PRO TIP: If you're going to order the Wynn burger, walk on over to Society Cafe for a way better experience!  ZOOZA BURGER ($15.49): Expensive for a burger, but my better half gave it his approval. It's pretty gigantic too, so at least you're getting your moneys worth. 4/5 FRIES ($3.99): Taste like Burger King fries (not necessarily a bad thing). 3/5  VIBE: Upscale Denny's minus the servers + counter service for ordering. I was surprised at how slammed this place was on a Sunday night at 9PM. It's connected to the Sportsbook.    SERVICE: It was near impossible to catch one of the servers for a refill. The option to go up to the registers and ask a cashier for a refill is an option but they were so busy tending to the never ending line of customers we didn't want to bother them. The Deli is pretty much self-serve.   Worth a Return Visit? Our grand total came to $37 and some change. I'm not planning on coming back, but if you're in a rush or are trying to keep your dining costs at a minimum while you're at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers Deli will do.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #105"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the Wynn by the sports book. You wait in line to order your food, you're given a number, you find a seat, and the food is brought to your table. I go here often if I stay at the Wynn or Encore, and the food is good. Sometimes it's hard to find a table if it's busy.  They have very common foods including burgers, hot dogs and salads.  Food is good and not bad on the wallet. One of the cheaper good options at the Wynn."}
{"text":"Casual option at the elegant Wynn Las Vegas. You order and then choose an open seat with your number flag in your hand.  I ordered the Manhattan Clam Chowder and the Corn Beef Reuben. I understand it is inside the casino but $20! for the two items!  Both were good but not something that will have me dying to come back to. It was my first time trying Manhattan Clam Chowder and being from the Bay I usually get the New England kind. It was good and hearty but not filling (if that makes sense...). The corn beef with the melted cheese on the reuben was good but I have had better.  As a local it's hard to justify this option but I guess as a tourist with little option for transportation this could be the spot to go to..."}
{"text":"I love this little cafe! They have this delicious vegan burger. It comes with a coconut chocolate milk shake l. It's my favorite snack to have in the middle of the day. Their chocolate cake is amazing with the decadent chocolate layered with moist chocolate cake. The crowd is much more casual and young compare to most of the other parts of the Wynn."}
{"text":"Very over priced and not worth it at all.  My Mo Wrap was dry and tasteless.  The service was good so I gave 2 stars.  Better off walking across the way to the mall."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not sure where all of the high marks are coming from.  Please realize what this place truly is.  It is the fast food place that serves the sports book.  It is not some magical NY style deli.  The food is very meh.  The chicken nachos are kind of dry, no beans and just kid stuff nacho cheese...meh.  The wings, not crispy, and very meh.  Add a beer and it is very expensive.  If \"quick style\" food is what you want, go to Society and get an (albeit) expensive burger.  This place is basically not what you might expect.  For very casual food you need to go over to Venetian / Palazo, this is very pricey for the very very bland sports book food.    The dates were over 6/11/15 thru 6/14/15"}
{"text":"While staying at the Encore for my Birthday celebration, we needed to get quick bite to eat. We decided to walk over to the Wynn, and found ZOOZACRACKERS Deli.  Despite the funny name, this is a great place to grab a sandwich or burger. The food is very good. What I liked the best that it's an affordable place for the Wynn/Encore."}
{"text":"They have a happy meal for vegans! It's a vegan burger with fries & a chocolate shake. It's a small meal, but perfect for people like me who usually only eat 1/2 of larger portions. It's simple yet tasty. It's located inside the Wynn hotel. If you enter the main entrance off of the strip, it's only a few steps to the left. I called in my order and it was ready when I arrived. Their vegan options are too limited for my liking, but I was happy with my meal. Perfect for a quick bite.   Note: the price for the vegan burger combo has increased from $9 to $11."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night for a late night snack. The place is cute and good for people watching, but the food was disappointing. We had the french dip, hotdog and fries. Everything was on the expensive side and not very good. We would not eat here again. This was the third restaurant we tried at the Wynn and all were overpriced and mediocre."}
{"text":"While we were hungry walking around the casino looking for a place to eat, we ran into this. We were impressed with a NYC style deli and we figured that it had to be the coolest name ever. So we went in and placed an order. They actually had Dr Browns cream soda which was impressive. I don't see that too much outside of NYC/New Jersey. But as the we waited for the order, we finished our soda. It actually took about 30 minutes to get our main course. The roast beef and dip was very dry and the sandwiches were small. My boyfriend said that his burger was ok, but I don't think our meal captured the true Vegas experience. I expected more from a restaurant at the encore!"}
{"text":"Bff and I shared a pastrami sandwich here. It was good! bit piles of meat, tasty rye. Even the mustard was kinda good (I don't like mustard).   Sandwich came with a pickle, which was also good.  I like the way it looked, and the booths had comfortable seats.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I have eaten here several times when we have been at the Wynn for shows.  I would say this time was just ok.  I had the half corned beef sandwich with side salad.  I enjoyed the vinaigrette dressing and the salad itself.  The corned beef was nice but the sandwich was a bit greasy.  My mom had a full pastrami sandwich.  She asked for a side of fries but the cashier never added them to our order.  Luckily we were not charged for them but we wanted the fries.    This place can get busy but we hit it at a down moment so we did not have to wait long to order at the counter or for our food.  I would say this is a good place to go when you want a quick sandwich or salad before a show and don't want to go to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for a lunch, late night snack, or late breakfast. There are many sandwich options and small plates. My husband and I ordered the pastrami fries, it was our favorite. The fries were fried to perfection, so much cheese and pastrami in between layers. It was such a big portion we couldn't finish it (14$). The loaded burger was huge and juicy. The meat was cooked throughly. I ordered a chicken noodle soup which was the only thing I didn't like. It was totally flavorless. I had to add tons of Tabasco sauce and lemon to make it a little bit better. It is a little pricy for being a deli but you are at the Wynn hotel."}
{"text":"Located inside The Wynn Hotel. Breakfast served til 11 with only breakfast options available. Steak & egg bagel was delicious. Service was prompt."}
{"text":"Zoozacrackers is a little dinner slash deli in the Wynn right next to the sportsbook.    There was nothing impressive about it, but the prices are not too bad compared to other places at Wynn and Encore.  However, it this place was at the Flamingo the prices would be considered too high.    I went here with the wife because of the convience of not leaving the hotel other than that I would pass. So its more of a 2.5 but I will give it a 3 for theres nothing else comparable in the Wynn or Encore when you want comfort food without going to one of the more expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food with a funny name. Want a good deli inside a casino? Why not? Sandwiches are fab especially the pastrami. The chocolate smore treats are cool and different. Prices are typical Wynn but good quality ain't cheap."}
{"text":"This is probably the most affordable place next to the Cafe in the Wynn. The deli is next to the Sports Book. I like how they have a glass display of some of their food items so you know exactly what the food looks like with no surprises.  I usually get the salads at Zoozacrackers. The Cobb Salad and the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Salad are both amazing. I think they make the salads fresh because when I ask for no bleu cheese crumbs in my cobb salad, they are always really accommodating.   For dessert, I recommend their cookies & cream cheesecake. It is soooo delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet!   I WISH THEY WERE OPEN EARLIER! I stood in front of the deli for a good 10 minutes just waiting for it to open."}
{"text":"Zoozacrackers is a must stop for me when I'm in Vegas, whether I'm staying at the Wynn or not. Their sandwiches are great and big enough for two to share. But, it's their matzo ball soup that keeps me coming back again and again. It's the best on strip in my opinion. The chicken broth is very flavorful and the matzo ball is the size of a baseball. Seriously, that thing is a meal in itself. If you go for anything, go for that.  The staff is always great and the place is kept clean. Prices are decent for a place on the strip and being in the Wynn. So, if you want some good food that won't break your Vegas budget, Zoozacrackers is the spot for you. Did I mention they have matzo ball soup? :)"}
{"text":"Tempted to give this one star - this was one of our favorite places to grab a fast lunch or dinner on the Strip. The matzo ball soup was to die for - but now you might just pass out from all of the added salt. Truly, you can float in the soup now, it's so sickeningly salty. And the roast beef sandwich was full of gristle. What happened in the kitchen? Was this just an incredibly bad night, or have they stopped caring? We won't go back, but I hope other Yelpers will take a chance and will let me know if this was just a bad night in the Zooza kitchen."}
{"text":"This joint was lacking. Overpriced and had the nerves to bring out cold grease drenched French fries. I purchased a hot dog, chicken BLT, french fries and a coke for $31??? Stay away..."}
{"text":"If I weren't already at Wynn, I wouldn't eat at Zoozacrackers.  Wynn's delicatessen is small, the atmosphere is only fair (more like a sports bar than a deli), the selection is limited, and the prices are a bit high.  On the positive side, it's convenient, and they make a mean heart attack sandwich, also known as the Zoozaburger: one hamburger, large, thick, and tasty; a layer of warm pastrami; melted Swiss cheese; cole slaw; some sort of dressing; a good bun.  Tomato, pickles, and some other stuff are served on the side.  Price: $13 plus tax and tip.  On another visit, I had a warm pastrami sandwich.  The pastrami was warm and juicy, reminiscent of Canter's deli.  The bread was dense and chewy, also similar to Canter's.  A very good sandwich.  On the other hand, their moderately large hot dog was bland and uninspiring, and their chicken salad had little flavor other than salt.  They also offer a ridiculously large, ridiculously rich, ridiculously fattening brownie.  This brownie gets around.  It's been seen at some of Wynn's other informal eateries as well."}
{"text":"For a high end & semi expensive Deli place should have filtered water for paying customers. Came here yesterday night after a disappointing experience at their buffet. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad along with a triple decker sandwich. When I asked for a cup of water I notice the water was coming from the tap and it wasn't filtered. For spending $ 35.00 for 2 meals Mr Wynn should be able to have a filtered water installed for his paying customers. I asked for Honey mustard dressing and Ranch you can tell they use the good stuff not some knock off cheap alternative.   Water 2/5 maybe get this filtered and I'll give it a 5/5   Triple decker sandwich 3/5 the bacon was hard and not flavorful  BBQ chicken salad 4/5 has a nice taste and big portions    I wish Mr Wynn had better alternative for people who is staying at the hotel and don't want to drive to get a decent breakfast, lunch or dinner. I can say Grand Cafe at Sunset station is nothing fancy but those guys knows how to cook and the value and price is decent."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night sandwich. It's typical deli counter Service where you order and pay then they bring you your food.  I ordered pastrami on rye to go. Got back to my room and was disappointed. Very dry, salty sub par pastrami. I guess I'm spoiled with the options we have in NY or even with Bens in South Florida. But I was shocked this being in the Wynn hotel that it wasn't authentic NY style pastrami."}
{"text":"While attending the Consumer Attorneys of Los Angeles Annual Convention in Las Vegas at the Wynn to obtain needed Continuing Legal Education credits to remain an active member of the California State Bar and retain my right to practice law in the State of California, I needed a quick and good lunch spot.  Zoozacrackers seemed to nicely fit the bill.  It was my first time here, and my eyes truly were bigger than my stomach, for I over-ordered.  Very good Matzoh Ball Soup turned out to be a huge fluffy matzoh ball surrounded by numerous noodles, carrots, tender hunks of chicken, and a flavorful chicken broth.  I just ate half of it.  This was followed by an also very good Lean Corned Beef on Rye, with one slice of nicely melted Swiss Cheese.  Aided by French's Yellow Mustard, the heaping sandwich was just moist enough.  A large side of Potato Salad turned out to be composed of chunks of cooked Redskin potatoes mixed in a very tasty dressing that was tossed over all.  Much of this fine dish was left behind as well.  With a soft drink, the total bill for one was low according to Wynn restaurant standards but topped $30.00 for one!  I wouldn't want to pay that freight for lunch too often, but the experience compressed into slightly less than an hour (because of a large gathering of lined up fellow diners and a seminar to attend) was very good overall, and bears repeating at a more leisurely pace."}
{"text":"We tried Zoozacrackers for breakfast (the lines were too long elsewhere) and came away pleasantly surprised. While the offerings were slim (it is a deli, after all) we chose the ZoozaBenedict and a Breakfast sandwich. The Eggs Benedict were excellent and the sandwich was as well - my wife stated that it was too big to finish but it disappeared anyway. Funny how that worked - I had been hoping for a bite.  The waitstaff was very attentive and brought me a full coffee to go when I asked if I could get an empty cup to pour my remaining coffee in and take back to the room. Not crowded at 8:30 am and well worth the trip. Our bill was $26.00 and we will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Considering that all the other dining establishments inside the Wynn wouldn't let my friends in (due to the fact they were wearing Tank tops and Shorts, it's Vegas! .. not everyone is here to dress up)  We dropped by Zoozacrackers Deli to grab a \"light\" dinner due to their earlier partying. The lady at the counter was very nice and suggested options and explained the menu. I ordered my fave French fries because you can't really screw it up. My friends ordered soups, jalapeno poppers and of course beers ($7-8)  I didn't try the soups, but my fries were good with a delectable crunch."}
{"text":"Quick summary - decent NY style deli fare for casual diners looking for a relatively inexpensive any time of the day meal within the top notch Wynn/Encore casino resort.  Don't expect much in terms of service, it is a walk up to the counter and place your order with a helpful cashier and take your \"number\" to the seat of your choice and wait for the runner to bring it to you casual dining operation.  Food is okay to good. Dessert looks decent, but did not have a chance to try it.  Meal Price = $15-25 avg per person. My cousin, uncle and one of their office staff were visiting from Taiwan and attending the SuperZoo Tradeshow at Mandalay Bay. After picking them up from MB, we headed for the Wynn and ended up at Zoozacrackers, which is near the Wynn Sports Book.  After looking over a sign near the entrance with a partial listing of the menu, we waited in line to place our order with the cashier.  The bill for 4 came to $89 plus change and we ordered 3 soups, 2 iced teas (really a super profit center for Wynn),  1 Turkey Reuben, 1 Hot Pastrami, 1 Mo Wrap, 1 Tuna Salad Sandwich, and a Rebel Fries. After finding a table and sitting down, it felt like a long time for our order to be prepared and brought out to us.  It could be that there was another group of 5-6 that ordered right before us.  Anyway, it is probably the fact that it was already 3:50pm and they had originally planned to be at the airport at 4pm. So when the food arrived, my cousin finished her soup before I was done taking pictures of all the food we had ordered.  And normally she is not exactly a fast eater, but walking around a tradeshow for 8-9 hours can make anyone famish. But we still have time to properly finish the meal before having to rush off to the airport.  I asked for to-go containers and the cashier was nice enough to go search in the back for several large ones for us.  So I basically have 1/2 of each sandwich we ordered for my tasting and Yelp review.  My Hot Pastrami was decent.  Good portion of thinly sliced pastrami, but not as good as Katz's (even though they supposedly checked out Kat's in NY when they were planning the menu) on choice of bread (Rye, White, Sour Dough, etc.). But good enough to come back for more for me.  My Uncle's Turkey Reuben - not my favorite. Overall the sandwich just feels dry, and the turkey is the main culprit. And holding it in your hand makes it greasy.  Mo Wrap - looks good in the display case, and tastes good too. The coleslaw is what gives this turkey wrap the tangy moistness that have doomed the other turkey sandwich in the deli menu lineup.   Tuna Salad Sandwich - this was ordered by accident, since my cousin had intended for it to be a \"salad\" salad for us to share, but there are only 3 salad options on the menu (Chef's Salad, Cobb and Caesar). The tuna salad mix was okay, reminds me of the Tuna Panini Sandwich served at Jean Philippe's Patisserie at Bellagio/Aria, except with less chopped celery and black pepper, and red onions instead of white). But it really is too moist for the bread and the bottom piece of bread quickly became too soggy. I would not order it in the future for the messy factor, plus why come to Vegas for a sandwich you can easily make at home?  Rebel Fries - just your fries topped with gooey cheese, jalapeño, and other not too memorable garnishes. Portion is large, definitely a meal for one or a side for sharing. But taste is blah at best.  Soups - Big portions  and I would considered a good deal for a dining establishment within the Wynn or other major Strip casinos.  Highly recommended if you want something satisfying and have positive perceived value for the money.  Iced Tea at $3.50 + tax - Highway robbery pricing for the less than 8 oz of liquid you get in a small plastic cup, mostly filled with ice cubes.  Steve Wynn admitted/bragged about his casino's super high profit margin from beverage sales (like1,000%) and this is a fine example of how he is delivering shareholder value.  Anyway, I would not really recommend this place for locals, but if you are a visitor to Las Vegas and staying at the Wynn/Encore or even across the street at Palazzo, it is a decent price meal option without having to cab it to some other restaurant. Of course you can pay more for the buffet and get a fabulous meal with a lot of variety.  3 stars for visitors without a car (2 stars for Las Vegas locals, because we can drive to better places that are cheaper and frankly offers better food). If you want to eat at the Wynn, seriously consider the Wynn Buffet or other sit down restaurant which will cost more but you also get better food."}
{"text":"I could never pronounce the name of this place. I don't even know what the f*ck a Zoozacracker is! I always thought Zoozacracker sounded like a racist remark people would use in Queens or the Bronx or something.   I've probably come here once every year for the last 4 years. I wrote a review about this place about a year ago but the filter ate it, claiming I was a worker here.   Finally wanted to figure out what a Zoozacracker is, so I googled it. Found no information. Decided to break the words apart. We all know what a cracker is, but what the f*ck is a Zooza? Well, according to google a Zooza is some dude who provides an individual legal proof that they are the owner of a horse..or something like that. Still, I have no f*cking clue what that is supposed to mean! Combining Zooza(Horse licensure litigation specialist guy) with Cracker(Saltine Square), doesn't make a shred of sense. But, nothing does here. The interior design looks like either a David Lynch movie, or the room where Debbie Harry starts rapping in the 1981 mtv music video, \"Rapture\". I know \"irony\" is the big thing these days, but I don't f*cking like irony. It sucks. The interior design can ironically f*ck off!  They got this burger that they pack with coleslaw, thousand island, and swiss cheese. It's not bad. It's extremely messy though. The Rueben is also pretty good, but I don't think there is one New Yorker alive that would say it can compare to Carnegie, Weiss, or Greenberg Deli(all here in LV/Henderson).   The first time I ever came here was with my poker buddy in 2009. We had accumulated about $15 of comps. The bill came out to like $17 and the lady at the counter waived the extra $2. They had excellent customer service back then. Came back a few months later but this time they made us pay the balance.   Of course they charge for every little thing. I've been to kosher delis that would charge for a side of thousand island for my New York Sky High, so I'm not surprised. Actually, I won't be surprised if they start charging for the water and the pickles soon.  The first time I decided to eat here, I asked multiple Wynn workers the question: \"Where is Zoozacrackers located?\" None of them knew the answer. Most of them didn't know what the f*ck I was talking about. One guy even told me that Zoozacrackers was located at Koval and Flamingo.... When I finally found the place, I couldn't get in because in front of the entrance was Antonio Tarver. He was piss drunk and having an argument with some chick who was dressed like a stripper. Typical day in Las Vegas....."}
{"text":"A cafe that was slightly bigger. Fast to order because line wasn't that long, but a lot of people were eating here. It is a cheaper option compared to the other restaurants at Wynn.   Food came slow since it was made to order.  I got the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo. The clam chowder soup I got was good on the flavor and seems healthier since didn't seem like cream/milk was put into it, but it was on the cold side. I wished it was hotter. The turkey sandwich was meh, not that good. The mayo didn't help with the flavoring much so i used the horseradish to up the flavor. Way too much meat on the sandwich so i took out most of it. I was hungry, so i had to eat it."}
{"text":"This was fine for what it is.  A fast food type of place with some non authentic deli foods.  After eating 2 very overpriced buffet meals at Wynn( xmas eve and xmas day), we decided to just have a light dinner on Xmas day.  I read the reviews so I knew what to except.  We brought in our own sodas because I don't fancy paying 3.50 for a soda.  They gladly gave us a glass of ice.    We shared the matza ball soup(7.49).  I was expecting a salt lick, but it was actually a little bland.  I had to add a little salt to make it tastier.  The matza ball wasn't the best I've ever had.  It was a tad on the heavy side, not light and fluffy like I prefer.    We shared a turkey burger too.  It was huge( 11.99), and it came with a pickle and that's about it. It was a really good turkey burger though, probably one of the best I've had.  We got a side of fries( 3.99).  Those were cold and not crispy.   I sent them back and they didn't come back to use until we were finished with the burger.    All in all, it was fine for what it was.  26.00 for the two of us and we left full.    The portions are large, be aware of that.  We saw two women order soup, salad, and a burger each and their eyes just about bugged out of their head when they saw how much food they got.  They could have shared it all for half the cost"}
{"text":"Zoozacrackers is one of the less expensive options inside Wynn Las Vegas.   They offer deli counter service. Sandwiches, burgers, salads and soups. You order at the counter and they bring your food and drinks to your table. Free refills are offered and the food is decent.   One of the better deals to be had in this otherwise upscale resort."}
{"text":"The burgers are just ok for the price. This is one of the more reasonably priced places to eat in the casino"}
{"text":"Possibly the best 24 hour restaurant in Vegas.  Get the chicken pot pie, it's ridic.  Ribs and black bean soup were great too, as was the service.   AMAZED to find food this good at a 24 hour joint. The 5 stars stand until I eat there sober."}
{"text":"Food gets you from point a to point b. Nothing special, but it's convenient and right next to the sports book. I wouldn't seek this place out but I have no issue eating here every time I'm hungover. It's location gets it a 4star."}
{"text":"Viva Las $45 Burger!  Ok not really it was like $18 but throw in a wife and some drinks and its 45 drollars down the pipe.   So the real question is were the buns brushed with gold flakes? Nope but to be truly honest Its not just because its in a flashy Casino that it is expensive. This really is one of the best burgers I have ever had. They also have a Vegan burger for half the price if you're into that sorta thing.  Why was it so good? The buns were the super big poofy ones that are so nice and pillowy. The burger was very thick and perfectly cooked so that it had the perfect amount of juice.  The fries were pretty dang good too.   To top it off I've had a burger in SF that cost the same amount that sucked a$$ so I consider this place a gold mine for burgers.  Thanks Wynn."}
{"text":"ZoozaCrackers Deli is located in the Wynn Hotel by the sportsbook. If you're looking for casual dining at the Wynn, ZoozaCrackers Deli is the way to go.  I tried the pastrami, the chicken BLT, Manhattan Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle Soup, and Fries.  They were all delicious. Good quality meat.   The half sandwich and half soup combination is a pretty good deal.  Everything else per entree is a little pricey, but that's what you should expect at the Wynn.
