{"text":"Decor was severely dated, and would've preferred a different selection of background music for my meal (maybe some Dean Martin, not Lady Gaga at an Italian restaurant).  Despite the awful impression upon arrival, the food was above average in both taste and portion size.  Service wasn't the greatest, but was at least polite.

Wife and I agreed that, when we want a short-distance Italian meal, this now trumps the local Olive Garden because of value.  Not a place to take anyone you're looking to impress, though."}
{"text":"Upon entering this dimly lit building from the run down dirty parking lot you wonder if it's better on the inside then the outside.....

It's not.

No one to welcome or direct us to our table until we asked to be seated.  The decor is from the 1980s complete with fake dusty flowers, mirrors on the walls and in the booths, the waiter's dressed in a tux.  

Menu makes a point to mention long wait times.  Average wait time for food should be 8-15 minutes, we waited hours.  The steak is cooked to hell, food was overpriced.  

Will not be returning here... and no one else should either."}
{"text":"Like stepping back in time to the 1960's-the food is very good and they know how to cook pasta-I really enjoyed my meal here"}
{"text":"What a great place. Terrific service!  Delicious food!  Huge portions!  Fair prices!  Give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I liked the food and service was good.  Price was fair but the building is shabby and definitely needs an update.  Not super kid friendly menu either...."}
{"text":"Nice homemade Italian food. Old dark interior. It's a friendly family place. So much better than the chain restaurants up the road."}
{"text":"Based on Food----5 Stars  ,  Service 3 Stars( very Yinzer )---- Atmosphere dark and gloomy....Old School Italian Restaurant....

Portions are way to large,  but I won't complain considering I get 2 meals out of my one entree...

Being an Italian guy from the South Hills , this is by far the best Italian food in the S. Hills"}
{"text":"I ate for the first time here for my rehearsal dinner. While the food was good, (my family loved their dinners) the service was terrible. It's not a big Restaraunt, but it felt like they only had 1 person working. Aside from our party there weren't many people dinning there. Our waitress took forever refilling our drinks and we waited almost an hour for food. I know people who love the place and swear by it, but it wasn't my thing, and definitely not the greatest Italian I have had."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here, based on the glowing reviews. What a major disappointment.

The entrance from the parking lot was dirty and drab. The inside and outside of the restaurant were depressing, dark, and outdated.

The service was underwhelming. Our waitress seemed like she did not want to be there.

The large portions of food were just satisfactory. A tasteless salad, soft, fluffy, tasteless bread that squished down to nothing when you picked it up, meat sauce with canned mushrooms, etc."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pittsburgh for years and always have passed this place so I decided to drop in. This is a mom and pop Italian restaurant. No fu fu or fancy decor. The proof is in the product. Ordered a simple spaghetti with marinara sauce and it was wonderful. Sauce had great depth of flavor. Will definitely stop again when I am in town."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Authentic Italian Food, seriously NOT a bad dish on the menu!  Huge portions at a very reasonable price!  Their sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for good Italian food.  This place fits the bill.  The entree comes with both soup and salad.  I thought the minestrone was delicious.  It was very flavorful and the not over cooked.  The salad was a little bland, iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, a couple of olives, chick peas, beets,carrots and a pepper.  The bread was one step away from white bread and the house wine was OK.

The 4 stars came from the main course.  I had veal parmesan and a side of pasta.  The sauce was amazing.  It made the meal. There are very few places where the base sauce is this good.

My meal with a glass of house wine came to $25 and change.  Well worth it. I will be back when I am in the area ."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years.  Great Italian restaurant in an area that is inundated with only chain options.  Homemade fare that never disappoints.  And, to top it off, I guarantee you won't leave hungry.  Portion sizes are great, and you get great accompaniments with your meal.  Usually get bread & butter or Garlic Bread, a salad, a cup of soup, and your side with your meal...all with a big bowl of freshly grated parm cheese.  For what you are getting, and the quality of it, I have no complaints with the price.    

I highly recommend their freshly breaded fried zucchini and mozz cheese as appetizers.

The minestrone is phenomenal and is REAL.  

For dinner, honestly, anything that looks good to you.  I've never had anything bad.  My go to, however, is their Chicken Scallopini.  My kids love their giant, wonderful Rav's.  

Desserts are great, as well.

The decor is, well, very outdated.. but--I don't go here to stare at the walls.  I go here to eat.  And, as I stated, i've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Minestrone soup is excellent. Excellent service especially from Linda. Just about everything is excellent. If you are thinking about going to Olive Garden nearby do yourself a favor an drive the extra half mile or so and go to Ciccantis for real Italian food."}
{"text":"Everything is excellent!!!!! Extremely high quality food at a great great price!!!   They don't hit you for every extra thing not like some other places!"}
{"text":"Usually have a good meal here, basic Italian dishes are well cooked, tasty sauce, etc. service is always good. Nothing really special, but good. Tonight was an off night , had the special of Shrimp and Scallop  Cacciotore  that had an odd taste, (maybe green olives?) but was also so salty I couldn't finish it. You know it is bad when your lips burn. Normaly I find the dishes over salted , but can tolerate it. Next time I have to remember to ask them to hold the salt."}
{"text":"Place is perfect good friend of mine Bobby told me to come and I'm glad I stopped I'll definitely be back ... everything had a great tase from the veal to the bread ... super friendly staff overall 5 star from the first bite"}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 20 years. This is truly some of the best Italian food in the south hills. Really, it's one of the only good local restaurants in the south hills that's riddled with chain bombs. 
This is the ONLY place I will order chicken Romano. The very best. Thin pieces of chicken lightly fried in an egg batter. Meat based entrees come with soup, salad and choice of pasta or veg of day. Those are a meal without even touching the the entree. Very fair prices. 
Best food choices:
Pork Chops Campanola style.  Add hot peppers if you like the heat. 
Chicken Romano
Linguini with clam (I prefer the white sauce.)
Fried zucchini appetizer...thin, thin, thin slices!
Stuffed olive appetizer
Any veal dish can be subbed with chicken. 
I prefer the tomato sauce to the marinara. 

Is the decor a bit old style? Yes, but that's what I feel adds to the charm of the old style Italian food. In the south hills of Pittsburgh, this is a must go."}
{"text":"Mom and i come in at least once a month for the broiled scrod. It's the best! In our opinion,the best family Italian restaurant in the area.  Frank and Theresa, the owners, always stop out for a hello, and service is always friendly and attentive.
  The best part is you can buy a jar of their pasta sauce to take home!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for sometime. My husband, in-laws and I decided tonight was that night. We were seated promptly as it was a quarter past 5p.m on a Friday. Ordered our drinks and appetizers, shortly after put our dinner order in. Waited over an hour for our meals while tables that were sat after us had received their food before us.  The hostess needs an etiquette class on how to deal with customers and the owner sat and argued with us instead of trying to make things right. No worth your money! Being Italian and knowing how we pride ourselves with our food and service this place was a joke."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Marsala which I order at many Italian ristorants.  I was disappointed the chicken was raw in the center.  My husband has been cooking for over 40 years concurred with me.  The owner/chef choose to disagree with me and said it was the prosciutto and melted cheese that made the chicken appear raw,  no it was raw.  I also had pasta with a red sauce that was burnt.  I did not complain as the owner, Frank, already argued about the chicken.  Frank should have been less concerned with the front of the house staff and more concerned with the back of the house.   The wait staff were  great and I do not blame them for my meal.  In the end I did have chicken parmigiana which was just OK.  My husband had one of the specials that again was OK."}
{"text":"Where to start food so so place is dark and dirty it was either my waitress first day on the job or she was just clueless don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. It's a mom and pop Italian place in an area when everything is Chain. I've been here a few times. Always hoping it would be better then the time before. It wasn't. On my first visit our server brought out champaign glasses with an inch of water in them and had no idea how to open the bottle of champagne. Then disappeared for most of the meal. That seems to be the going trend with this place. I've had under cooked pasta, stale bread, dry chicken and egg shell in deserts. I feel they are over priced and not worth the $20 they charge for a basic dish. This is not a place I will be visiting again. I tried I really did but in the end I always left disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Prices are reasonable and service is great. Expect to have leftovers! Fantastic minestrone. If you like good Italian food, don't pass this place by!"}
{"text":"First time here & definitely not the last. Wasn't sure because of the dated appearance but saw the great reviews & had to try. Glad I did. 
Nice hearty salad to start (more than just a slice of cucumber, & slice of tomato. Came with beets, tomato, chic peas, olives, and pepper. (All big enough to pull off if desired). You get Italian bread or garlic bread (we got both). I had the eggplant mozzarella & husband got the manicotti. We were very pleased. Came out hot and fresh. My eggplant was lightly breaded to perfection. The homemade sauce is FANTASTIC. My husband got the homemade tiramisu (which I nibbled on). Also very good. 
As other reviews have said- interior is dated however it's very clean. Service (Ben) was excellent."}
{"text":"Best filet mignon in the city! I'm not lying!! It's under $30 and giant. You always get really good service there and you feel like you are in Italy! I would recommend it to anyone that likes steak and Italian food. Hey use to sell their pasta sauce at the uncommon market, it closed unfortunately- bless its soul"}
{"text":"Oh my ... The quality of the food is just exceptional!  A real Italian place with Frank (the owner and chief chef) dressed in chef coat and hat, and red kerchief around his neck.  He ambles around, seems to know everyone and will talk and keep you engaged if you are sitting at the bar alone.  Ok so he isn't in the category of Valozzi- but the good news is this place provides a reasonable and very tasty Italian meal that won't require you to take out a loan.I just finished spaghetti and meatballs- a portion so large I'm taking 3/4 home.  My wife had veal Romano - one of the few places in town that doesn't ruin it.  It's buttery,crispy, light and tender.  Do stop if you are near Jefferson Hospital.  Just down the road on 51.  I've been coming for years and the quality and taste is consistent.  We love you Frank!"}
{"text":"Was in town on business and we almost drove by, but so happy we didn't. From the nice conversation with owner Frankie, too the amazing and friendly service from the sweet and beautiful blonde bartender. I live in NY and would like to think I have had some great Italian food, this stacks up. Prices were so reasonable, and portions were big enough for the largest appetites. Don't miss trying this place!!!"}
{"text":"Good local place for Italian food. We got veal dish and a special that was spicy shrimp and broccoli plate. Both dishes were good and they come with bread. Nice little place to eat and staff was great. Nice experience."}
{"text":"So disappointed....my husband and I were really looking forward to trying this place as we drive by it all the time. Food was awful....stale bread, either frozen or left out for days. Appetizers were fried zucchini which was over cooked or stale...either way unappealing. Also had mozzarella sticks...breading tasted old and stale as well. Our entrées were less than as well. Fettuccine Alfredo which was bland, and spaghetti and meatballs which was nothing special. Drinks were 3.50 for a bottle of yuenling, which is more than other local restaurants. Only thing that was decent was our waitress, she was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"It lived up to the hype! Great food and atmosphere! Not a lot of glimmer/glitz but great food at more than a reason price! You could pay to eat here everyday and not go broke! If your looking for an above the level Italian Restaurant with a variety of dishes.... This is it! So much food and great food! One of the Best Steaks I have ever had and they are an Italian Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Snuggled in between all of the chain restaurants of Jefferson Hills you find this tiny restaurant with many locals during lunch (they have a nice lunch menu).

The chicken parm was pretty decent, it's not breaded it's served with ziti, if you want spaghetti instead there is an up charge.

I do not recommend the chicken dish called frank, it simply looked like boiled chicken,  had an overwhelming taste of lemon, very little artichoke or olive.

One of the girls at work ordered a steak salad, it came with soup and looked fairly large.

The owners are so cute, they definitely stand out greeting their guests throughout the dining area creating a homie feel that you simply can't get at a chain."}
{"text":"Dinner was great. Veal with artichoke and crab, soup and salad was included. Decor is neat and clean but nothing special. The waitress/bartender, I sat in the bar rather than the dining room was delightful. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I would return here without hesitation. I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"This restaurant surprised me. The ambiance is nice, the service is amazing, and the food is delicious!! The food is all freshly made and their tomato pasta sauce is the real deal. The minestrone is legitimate!! I strongly recommend this restaurant if you want good old school food and service. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Still didn't have the willpower to not stuff my grill and save room for canoli's but I went back several times. Talked with the owner and found out he grew up near where my family lived...which explains my love for the style of their cooking. I crave this place now that I'm gone. Go there and get anything. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food! They serve a very good pork chop dinner. Could uses a update on the decor but the food makes up for it. If you know someone who likes tripe theirs is very good, according to my wife & cousin! Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Old school in every way. Very good food. Nothing exceptionally fancy, just good Italian food. 1960's decor is to the point of adding \"charm\""}
{"text":"It was okay place with okay food.  It seems really run down and not the cleanest.  I went once and wouldn't go back.  Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Ciccanti's and it was for a private party that was catered.  The chicken was absolutely delicious and the salad was fresh and plentiful.  They do a nice job here for hosting a fairly large private party.  
While it is a bit outdated you're not coming here for trendy ambiance, but for a good meal served by friendly people."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Italian restaurant in the South Hills. My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for 25 years or so.  Everything is homemade from a chef straight from Italy, Frank Ciccanti and his sons as this is a family run business. The Marinara sauce is to die for and you can buy it by the quart to go. The chicken Romano and veal mozzarella are delicious and both come with a side of pasta or vegetable and soup and salad. The homemade minestrone and chicken pastina soups are also delicious.  There are many appetizers including mozzarella sticks, artichokes alla Romano and fried zucchini which I would highly recommend.  He has daily specials and everything is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. The wait staff makes you feel at home. I would recommend if you go on a Friday or Saturday evening after 5 pm that you make a reservation as they get very busy."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go. It's old-style Italian with nicely sized portions. Garlic bread, soup, salad, and vegetables are included with almost all meals at no additional cost. The tiramisu is made in-house and is amazing."}
{"text":"After not getting into another place and even solo, I was disgusted and went back to hotel. Front desk says this is a great choice. Having a glass of white moscato, a lemon ? dessert, and a pasta of marinara and shrimp, chicken and...stuff. Great service from bar area with nice table. So the cake is...just ok. Escargot here now also. Is pretty and in the shell. They are pretty good. Have not had in shell prior that I recall. 
Remodeling apparently by sign on door. No evidence inside. I'm sitting in a divey bar type area. Not a nasty place, just unlike a restaurant. It works though. My main pasta dinner is beautiful and excellent."}
{"text":"Price is good but stops short of great Italian. Place is busy ans the family owners are wonderful and they will do anything to make things right. 
Spaghetti sauce is not cooked enough for me. Veal really thick. Fried Zucchini not much taste.
Really busy place though. each to his own taste.
I will go if people ask me but will not be a top choice for me."}
{"text":"Ciccanti's has been around quite awhile, but before this incarnation the Chef and owner was at Naples on Banksville Road. That business had started originally downtown and was quite the hotspot. I worked here and I know how clean the kitchen is kept. The food is always hot, delicious and made with love! If your looking for great Italian food, go to Ciccanti's you will not be disappointed and will probably never eat at Olive Garden and the rest of the chains after eating here!"}
{"text":"An excellent value for good Italian food. This locally owned place includes soup, salad, garlic bread, and a side with all non-pasta entries and the prices are very reasonable. 

The offer children's portions of anything on the menu at a discounted price. I can feed by 3 tweens, me and the wife for about $65, or $75 with a hafe-carafe of house Chianti.

Food is better than the Olive Garden and there is rarely a wait. The building needs a bit of work but I go there to get a good meal at a very reasonable price not for the decor."}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight for the first time.  Very good food at a great price.  10 meals on Sunday for under $10 with a Soup or Salad plus bread.  Restaurant was able half full and there was a very large party in the banquet room as well.  Service was very much on point and food was very good.  I couldn't stop enjoying the food and my wife decided to bring half of hers home.  No room for dessert.  Décor is a little outdated but the place is very clean.  Owner stopped to see if we enjoyed our 1st visit and told him he will be seeing us again soon."}
{"text":"Not exactly my favorite, but authentic italian food. Much better choice than the Olive Garden if you are looking for a night out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times; it's usually pretty good. Meals can take a while to come out though. It has a very loyal local following."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5's and I'm not a big Italian food fan.  Despite that, Ciccanti left me with no other choice.  Expect delicious perfectly crafted home made Italian food with massive portions, reasonable prices, a charming, cozy restaurant and very friendly staff.  All entrees include an amazing mixed salad that's big enough to be an entree by itself.  The red peppers stuffed with sausage, crab stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini with marina appetizers are particularly recommended, but my group of 4 didn't try one thing they didn't love.  The biggest complaints I can come up with are the tables are a tad small and I wish it was closer to my house.  Then again, I might move just to be closer.  To Ciccanti I must shout, BRAVISSIMO!"}
{"text":"A nice local Italian eatery. The facility needs refreshed and that's the only reason I didn't give them 4 or 5 stars. The service is good and the food is better. The portions are fair and they are a kid friendly restaurant if you want to take the whole family."}
{"text":"I was staying in West Mifflin for two nights and was looking for a local restaurant to eat at instead of all the chains.  The hotel recommended this place and gave me directions.  Of course I had to check the other reviews on Yelp first so an average of 4 stars gave this a good shot of being something speclal.

Walking into the place, it's one of those places where the decor has not been updated in about 40 years.  You walk into the bar area first.  The wallpaper is dark, there's a bar in the middle and a few booths off to the far wall.  The carpeting does not match the walls.  There's also a dining room back beyond the bar.

I sat myself at the bar.  I was instantly greeted by the bartender.  I asked for a local beer.  She didn't know which ones were local so I opted for Yuengling which is PA based but still not local to that area. 

On with the menu.  Lots of Italian options here and they also had 4 specials as well.  Prices were very reasonable.  And your meal comes with soup, salad, and bread. 

The minestrone soup was delicious and contained lots of chunks of different vegetables.  The salad consisted of lettuce, chick peas, beets, carrots and tomatoes all perfectly arranged on the plate.  Mine came with the house vinagrette dressing which was simple yet very tasty.  Reminded me of a dressing at a place in my hometown.

For an entree, I ordered Chicken Frankie which was sauteed chicken breast with artichokes, olives in a lemon butter sauce.  Very tasty as well but the portion was just so huge that I couldn't finish half of it.

For dessert, I opted for a cannoli to go which I didn't really care for but wanted to try something other than cheesecake and tiramisu.  It was worth trying anyway.

Overall a great meal with great service.  Like some of the other reviewers, I had the opportunity to talk with the owner.  These local places are the ones who really appreciate your business so I make an effort to seek them out."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now. Its a go-to Italian spot now. A place from yesteryear.. the late 80s/ early 90s when restaurants were a luxury. Its a family affair, the food is stellar, not necessarily healthy, but just damn stellar. The atmosphere is well groomed since inception, nothing flashing, not faux-steampunk modern. Its not cookie cutter like Applebee's or Olive Garden, it is authentic. Be back soon!"}
