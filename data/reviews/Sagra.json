{"text":"We went for brunch today with friends.  The food was first-rate (eggs Benedict with a side order of their homemade \"hash\").   However, the service was very slow.  The one waitress on duty did her best but with taking orders, serving, clearing tables and making coffee, she couldn't keep up.  The biggest complaint is that we were charged for three bottles of mineral water.  When we arrived, she asked us if we wanted \"water\", which was served in generic bottles and tasted a whole lot like tap water.  When we drained one bottle, she'd bring another (and another) without asking.   I know they have to subsidize their very reasonable food prices somehow (no liquor licence still) but this seemed somewhat deceptive. We'll probably choose another place in the neighborhood next time we go out for brunch."}
{"text":"For pizza I'd give this place a 4 star rating. Authentic crust, good amount of toppings. Price fairly reasonable. Portion size reasonable.  Unfortunately, we also tried the daily risotto and the hand made gnocchi. The gnocchi were slightly overcooked. The risotto also wasn't terribly exciting. The big disappointment was the portion size - to me these were more like appetizer-sized portions. At $16 for the risotto and I think $14 for the gnocchi, I was pretty disappointed. At Marcello's we order 3 dishes for two adults and a 3 year old and always have a nice portion to take home. At Sagra we were barely full.  If we go here again, I'll stick to the pizza. And their bread is amazing."}
{"text":"With all the new pizza places popping up in my neighbourhood, I can just hear myself getting fatter.  We stopped in for dinner sans reservations.  I was a bit nervous assuming that we may have a bit of a wait but they were able to seat us right away.  No booze on their menu yet so we ordered some San Pellegrino sodas ($2.50) and the server brought us a cold bottle of water.  Orders - we both decided on pizzas.  I chose the prosciutto and arugula one ($15) and my DC went with the spicy sausage ($15).  We watched as they prepped our pizzas at the back counter and then slid it into the wood fire oven.  Pizzas were done pretty quickly and were quite good.  Nice thin crust and generous amount of toppings.  Really love the atmosphere at Sagra - it's small and intimate enough to recreate a hipster version of the spaghetti scene from \"Lady and The Tramp\".  Dessert - we had a choice of home made cannoli or Limoncello tiramisu (both $6).  We picked the tiramisu and it was the prefect ending to our meal.  It was light and refreshing with a nice sweet cream in between the layers of ladyfingers.  Good size for sharing between two people.  Overall, Sagra is one of my fave new restaurants in the 'hood and I prefer it to Queen Margherita just down the street."}
{"text":"I'm excited about this spot (and super stoked that I created their listing!). No license yet which is unfortunate but smells great in there and the funghi pizza was decent. It's a friendly 4 I'm giving these guys but looking forward to seeing this place develop."}
