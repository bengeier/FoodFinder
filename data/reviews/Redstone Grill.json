{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find this hotel restaurant!  We're were a group of 4 women staying at the hotel.  3 of us had different dinners.  Two salmon entrees with mashed potatoes, strip steak entree and a vodka pasta.
The 4 of us are from different parts of the country and from major cities.  We all agreed ours dinners were very tasty. All entrees came with a salad.  All entrees were reasonably priced.  All were very satisfied with our dinners.  The waitress was attentive.  I would recommend the restaurant.

We also ate breakfast choices from the menu.  Again all breakfast choices were just fine.  Waitstaff very pleasant."}
{"text":"Awful breakfast buffet.  I expected more from a Holiday inn restaurant.   Cold powdered eggs, cold bacon and nasty sausage and biscuits.  Coffee was good.....  server was excellent. 

Its not like they don't have a kitchen.   Why are they microwaving powdered eggs?  I stay at a lot of IHG hotels and this was worse than a a Holiday inn express meal..... but the same type."}
{"text":"I was stuck here for an event the lobby was very nice, bar looked good so we ordered drinks and asked about appetizer menu -downhill from here.  We had to take our drinks & cross an imaginary line into the restaurant.  Had to request menus, finally got to order over 20minute wait for chips, dip & onion rings. The chips were stale & the onion strings meant for dipping were crumbs.  Later our friends joined us 35 minute wait for sandwich & fish & chips, when we complained nothing! This place is horrible don't waste your money poor service, lousy food & management doesn't care.  My advice stop at the bar but don't cross the line!"}
{"text":"Thank you for reminding me that no how tired I think I might be, I should always get back out.  Horrible service. What was advertised on menu was not what you got, and no heads up.  Did I mention horrible service?

Thanks for making my choice of hotels, based on having a restaurant/bar a big mistake."}
{"text":"We had a great experience eating breakfast and dinner here for three days during our stay at the Holiday Inn.  There is a a large variety of delicious food, with daily specials at reasonable prices.  I was VERY impressed with the quality of service we received each day.  Chris is the evening and Raul in the morning.  Both were very friendly and knowledgable.  They went above and beyond to take excellent care of us."}
{"text":"My rating is based on the new ownership.  Redstone Grill is now Straight Up Gaming & Martini Lounge.  They have a slew of martini specials.  I tried the bubble gum and strawberry lemonade martini.  Both were very delicious.  The food is great.  I tried the Cajun chicken sandwich, steak salad, and my favorite the Charles special.  The Charles special is named after the new owner.  Its a mixed green salad serviced with candied pecans, berries, and raspberry vinaigrette.  Aside from the delicious food, they have drink specials.  My favorite night is Saturday.  On Saturday's they have a party hosted by Money B of Digital Underground.  The DJ plays old school Hip Hop music and current hits.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I spent an inordinate amount of time two nights ago researching this place online after happening onto the name and seeing it was close to where I am staying, only to run into one dead end after another.  No one, not one website, including a couple of Holiday Inn websites themselves seemed to have any concrete info on the place, just address and phone number.  No reviews, no on-line menus, nada. All I could ascertain was that this was the restaurant affiliated with the Holiday Inn of Mesa.

So I hope youze guize appreciate the info I collected by stopping in late last night to check them out and get the scoop.  They weren't real friendly and had no take out menus to peruse at home but I was able to get ahold of a dinner menu and a breakfast menu to photo so you can get an idea of what they serve.  There was a plate of basically eaten food, bones really, lying on the table where the host operated from and if the food tastes as good as the dirty dishes smelled I'd say it might be a winner.  Since I'd already eaten, I didn't partake of any food on my visit.

Check out the photos for info on hours and the dishes on the menus so at least you have a starting point if you decide to dine here.  I'll try to come back again some  evening when I haven't already eaten and provide an update."}
{"text":"Never ever heard this in a restaurant before. 

I'm sorry, but were out of mashed potatoes.

Had the French onion soup starter. It was Campbell's soup with a slice of American cheese on it. 

Hey wait... Potatoes showed up. Undercooked...."}
{"text":"The hotel is reasonable enough for a cheap business trip, certainly not to entertain clients, but for yourself, OK. And that about sums up the food as well. Breakfast buffet of about 4 hot items, reasonably tasty. You will truly enjoy McDonalds more than trying the dinner entrees. The servers are really very nice and attentive though. A good place for a drink after a long day, just skip the food."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like leaving the hotel so I ate here and was not disappointed. Ordered the grilled chicken with bacon and BBQ sauce. Chicken was good side dishes were small and not notable. Service was good."}
{"text":"Came down here with some friends and had dinner around 9pm. Good food OK service and bar. Like the name implies the interior was a reddish hue of stone and tile. In the past the food quality has been inconsistent but on this trip is was good. I had the Blackened Salmon and it was juicy and tasty. Everyone else's food looked good and properly prepared. I think Redstone Grill, Montana Meat Co. and Shucks Tavern might be owned by the same company since they are sharing advertising."}
{"text":"The Big F heard a few good things about Redstone Grill, and we had an Entertainment coupon to use as well.

We walked in shortly after 6 pm and noticed that we just  missed happy hour.  They have two happy hours as well!  (Monday through Friday, 3 pm - 6 pm and 12:00 am to 8 am)  All appetizers are half off, breakfast is half off during the reverse happy hour and drink specials are available.  Not a bad deal when their appetizers include seared tuna, sea scallops, crab cakes, lamb chops, and lobster quesadillas! 

We both ordered the Rib Eye Steak for $15.95.  \"12 oz. choice Steak marinated in our signature Redstone seasoning.\"  You get two sides with it and I went for the Baked Potato and Cabernet Mushrooms.  The Big F went for the Baked Potato and Onion Rings.  When he found out Black n Tan meant Guinness was used in the batter, it was an easy sell.

The food arrived pretty quickly and the baked potato came with all the fixings - butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon bits, and chives.  We were both pleasantly surprised with the food quality as well, especially for the price.  After finishing our meal, which was a fair amount, we were offered dessert.  I was interested in checking out their dessert menu, but the waiter upped one on me by bringing the dessert tray over!  Fancy!  Although the desserts looked and sounded great, we were stuffed! 

Service was good, our waiter along with his colleagues all came by to check on us and make sure things were good.  No shortage of employees here.  They also had a steady stream of customers coming in on this Thursday night.  

Overall, a good place with a nice selection of food to choose from and a price that doesn't hurt the wallet.

There's also a full bar section to the left while the restaurant portion is the right.

Sidenote: On Saturday nights, the restaurant section closes and \"The Loony Bin\" takes over.  This stand-up comedy show is $14.95 per person, but we got a coupon after dining there.
