{"text":"The overall experience was disappointing. The ambiance is very nice and the service was at par. We ordered the butter chicken and tandoori chicken. The butter chicken was acceptable but the tandoori chicken was terrible. It was evident that the chicken was not cooked after we placed the ordered and was very stale. We complained to the server. We chose the restaurant based on the reviews and the experience didn't live up the overall 4.5 stars the restaurant is rated."}
{"text":"Décor chaleureux et contemporain.  Accueil sympathique.  Le menu propose les classiques de la cuisine indienne.  Les plats sont savoureux.  Une bonne adresse indienne pour le Plateau et le Quartier latin.  On y retourne?  Oui, à l'occasion.  Les adresses sur Jean-Talon ouest restent une référence de choix."}
{"text":"Food was great to satisfy a craving for Indian. Food came quickly and the staff were friendly. I would come back."}
{"text":"I usually order the same thing which is veggie pekoras, chana samosas and shahi paneer and it's so tasty. It's my favorite tbh. I've only ever ordered from there but I'd still recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Propriétaire fort sympathique.  Côté cocktail, j'ai goûté au Bollywood (un mélange de vodka, malibu, liqueur de Midori, jus de lime, jus de kiwi) de ma voisine mais j'ai bien aimé à mon Sp écial Guru (champagne,sirop d'hibiscus, framboise)  Côté plat, que dire, il y en avait beaucoup. j'ai vraiment aimé la poutine poulet au beurre, les entrées fort réussies, tout était délicieux. C'est décidé, j'y retourne!!"}
{"text":"Yay! Super yummy Indian home delivery.    Since moving here from Vancouver we have been searching for some solid Indian home delivery in the Plateau.  Guru definitely fit the bill.  A little pricier, but worth it.    We ordered the Combo C online.  Food was promised in 45 minutes and it arrived ON THE DOT.  Hot and well packaged.  They even thew in a bonus yummy desert.   Really good portions with lots of meat.  Enough for dinner for two people and generous leftovers the next day.  Three people could eat easily.   We had the Butter Chicken - rich and delicious. We find all butter chicken in Montreal a bit on the sweet side, and this was was as well, but not nearly as yucky sweet as some we have had.  Solid.  Lamb Vindaloo - Ah, the illusive spicy vindaloo - so hard to find.  Their vindaloo was mildly spicy, but I want my vindaloo to burn a little. Tasty though.  Maybe next time I will see if they can kick up the spice level a little.    Onion pakoras - plentiful, with a generous amount of yummy tamarind sauce.    Chana Masala - loved it!  Saag - super flavourful with a bit of spice.  Got naan instead of papadums as listed, but perferred the naan, so happy there too!   We will be ordering again for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food in a nice neighborhood. We sat by the window and enjoyed the evening breeze while eating dinner. I ordered a paneer dish and my girlfriend got the baingan bharta; both were delicious. The garlic naan was some of the best I've had and perfectly cooked, as well. I requested my dish to be extra spicy and it had a pleasant kick to it, but wasn't overwhelmingly hot. They serve some interesting-sounding cocktails and beer, although Taj Mahal was the only beer they offered when I was there.  My only gripe is that the vegetarian dishes don't include rice and naan like the meat-based dishes do, which I don't really understand, but I guess that seems to be a pretty standard arrangement in Montreal."}
{"text":"Butter chicken poutine, Malai Kofta, and Masala Tea. Boom boom boom let me here you say way-ooh....way-ooh. Great Indian Food and Great Service!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing for the price. We ordered via foodora and the naan bread was undercooked, felt like we were eating raw dough. The vindaloo chicken wasn't even spicy, not even a little bit. The butter chicken and rice were the only decent thing.  For the price, would never go again. Definitely better options for cheaper or the same price."}
{"text":"Cuisine Indienne savoureuse et raffinée. Le menu est varié dont une dizaine de mets végétariens/végétaliens. Leur soupe dahl est un must. La carte des vins est composée des plus populaires et rien de charnu. La dimension des lieux est parfaite, assez de place pour une belle ambiance avec un niveau de bruit faible à moyen. Le service était bien mais sans plus ce soir là. C'était ma 2e visite depuis 1 an et je vais y revenir."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! La soupe dhal et le Bhelpuri étaient excellents, tout comme le repas principal. Très bon service. Endroit charmant!"}
{"text":"Mon indien préféré à Montreal! Propriétaire sympathique,très beau et chaleureux à l'intérieur,beau bar et il y a même une hôtel en-haut!! Si vous chercher un indien ne chercher plus!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken korma and chicken bhuna both were good maybe a touch more salt then needs. The Bombay lassi was awesome. The vegetable rise was good as was the garlic Nann. The service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"This is fantastic place to go but the food is not authentic Indian. It does contain lot of oil but less taste. If you are an Indian and looking for indian/punjabi food, this is not right place. It could be great if you don't know the real taste.   We ordered veg biryani and shahi panner. Veg Biryani was more of fried rice with little Masala flavor.  Shahi panner was almost same with taste of panner butter Masala. This is not worth of $$ if you are looking for good Indian food. I am from Dallas, TX and I guess this comes as very avg restaurant in my tried n tasted restaurant list.  Apart from taste, everything was fantastic. Great interior, lighting and service. All perfection. If they change their chef, this could be good pick.  Sorry for avg review but my taste bud didn't allow to go any further.  There is addition to this. The service man(waiter) had argument over the feedback and tip. And as per him, if food is not good, that's not his problem. So then I should go to any restaurant n pay separately for food n service. With this logic, yelp should have two review section. Man....world is full of crazy people with crazy logic. :-) lol..."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the Chicken Tika Masala! If I'm ever in MTL again, I'll for sure be back.  Now I'm just filling space because yelp is making me."}
{"text":"This is the first and only Indian restaurant I've tried in Montreal, and I'm not even remotely tempted to try another one, this has become my go-to friday night delivery. I've ordered at Guru several times now and the service has always been perfect.  I usually order samosas, pakoras, garlic naan, baingan bharta, byriani and vegetables jalfrezi for my roommate and I and we have never been disappointed. When we order from Guru we know that we can expect a tasteful, delicious meal and a punctual delivery. The prices may seem a bit higher than those of other Indian restaurants but keep in mind that - except if you are trying really hard to share a single pakora between three people - you can expect leftovers for the next day. Sometimes we even have enough for three meals (I said \"sometimes\", because it's really hard not to shove everything in your mouth in less than 5 minutes, it is THAT good).   The only time we had an issue was when they switched our order with someone else's but we just had to give them a call and they came back less than an hour later with the right order and dessert to make up for it. That's what I call being professional.   Conclusion: I am ready to pay a bit more to get the most delicious and authentic Indian food delivered to me in less than an hour and by a restaurant with an impeccable service, great values and perfect customer relations."}
{"text":"Hello! Tried Guru for the first time, based on reviews. I ordered the following:  - Lamb Vindaloo with naan and rice - Lassi  The lamb was tender and flavorful. The potatoes were a bit tough. The curry, however, was disappointing. I've had Vindaloo in Goa, India (origin of Vindaloo). Sadly, Guru's Vindaloo doesn't make the cut.   Lassi was good - tasty, fresh, frothy.   Naan was a bit on the thicker side. I'm from India and have had some mind-boggling naans at 'Dhabas' (roadside restaurants).   Rice was fluffy and flavorful.   I may try some of the other dishes at Guru's eventually, but won't be rushing back."}

{"text":"We went here because of the MTL a table event. It's a good time to try new restaurant since we already pretty fixated with a few Indian restaurant.  The menu was fixed, 21$ for three courses with naan and rice. I have to admit it's a bargain but it's the point of this event.  As usual, we chose different items to share.  The dessert that came with our main dish was not on the menu nor what we ordered. We asked why, the waiter said they didn't make the other two desserts today but he didn't say anything when we made the order. However, I saw other table having them. So the waiter lied about the desserts. I just don't know why. The coconut flake cake we got wasn't even on the actual menu. It seems cheap than other homemade desserts, especially I already had my expectations for the other two traditional dessert.  Nobody like being lied to. I just don't like dishonest business. It was a massive disappointment for me.  The appetizers we had were one salad and one fried veggi. We liked them both. The sauces were flavourful. The main dish we had was lamb madras. Lamb cube in curry and coconut flake & milk. This is another reason why I  hated the dessert, having coconut in my main course and as dessert. Not to mention the lamb was too soft, felt like they were left in the cooking pot forever. The curry sauce was tasty though.  Still holding my grudges."}
{"text":"Really fantastic Indian food but pretty bad service. Great decor and atmosphere. Butter chicken and pakoras were some of the best I've had. But our waiter was pretty bad, didn't give us any info and our food took over an hour."}
{"text":"I'm picky about Indian food but I absolutely love this place. I've never eaten inside the restaurant, but it's my go-to for takeout. My favourite dishes are the malai kofta, chana masala, baighan barta and saag paneer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were there for the MTL à Table 2016 event. The décor and the food was excellent. I had the Degustation Indienne as the main course which had Butter Chicken and the Lamb Vindaloo, and 2 vegetarian dishes with rice and naan bread and it was great, especially the butter chicken.   However, what was disappointing with our experience was the service we received. The first waitress we received was great. She answered all our questions and was very pleasant. For some reason we had a different waiter to take our order (and the rest of the evening) and and he did not seem interested in either working there or have us there like we were bothering him or something. He gave us contradicting information from the first waitress and did not even put up a smile throughout the night. One example of this was that for our dessert, which the menu said there were two choices, was served with our degustation main course. We were not told of this and only found out after we finished eating. So much for having a menu with choices. In the end, he gave us our bill without even asking for it. We weren't even offered tea or coffee. Seriously, I get better table service at a fast food restaurant. You clearly did not want us there and I'm glad to take my service elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were told about this place and it did not disappoint.  Excellent Indian food.  We tried the sampler and thought each of the dishes were superbly made and tasty.  I really liked the butter chicken although it probably is not good for my diet.  Amazingly, hardly anyone was in the restaurant although it probably suffers during the summer when McGill is out so there was no wait.  Had enough left over for a second dinner."}
{"text":"Cuisine indienne inventive (essayer le club sandwich indien servie dans un pain Nan). Excellent rapport qualité-prix. Les mets sont savoureux et typiques de la bonne cuisine indienne. Le resto est propre et le service impeccable. Tables bien dressée, coutellerie et assiettes recherchées. Je recommande sans hésitation ce resto."}
{"text":"I had the Combo C which included butter chicken, naan, rice, lamb vindaloo, cauliflower in curry, pakoras, and a dessert and it was amazing! The person said that it was meant for one person, but clearly it could feed two people really well. Amazingly though, I managed to finish 3/4 of my plate because it was that good. The food tastes good but I think it is catered more to foreigners since it is much less spicier, and a bit sweeter than traditional Indian food. Especially, the butter chicken was much sweeter than what I have usually had, and out of the whole plate, I liked it the least. However, the lamb vindaloo, and naan were my favourite out of the plate, but still the others were very good! The meat was all very tender and not overcooked, and not too under/over seasoned. It is a bit pricier than other Indian restaurants, but the place is nice and the food tastes clean and well made. Also, the portions are good so you can probably split the combo in half and be pretty full!"}
