{"text":"This is our favorite grab a good beer place. We have been going since they first opened. We enjoy the atmosphere, food and beer. A few of our favorite dishes, fish and chips, blackened catfish tacos, mac n' cheese, fried pickles and did I mention the beer?! They recently remodeled the place and added pool tables and shuffle board. It's a great hang out place and very happy it will be sticking around!"}
{"text":"The Haymaker on Tatum and Bell has always been a favorite family friendly hangout. After the new concept, open setting, and refreshed menu, I was impressed with the staff, management and this spot finding its groove! The build your own mac n cheese impressed the biggest critic, my 9 year old daughter! The starters, burgers, and cold beer will satisfy for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone down hill since it became a sports bar.  We used to love their breakfast.  The last time we were there I ordered the Cowboy Platter (my usual) and was informed that they no longer serve hash browns....how can you have a breakfast menu and not serve hash browns?  It was a Sunday morning, before the NFL games had started.  The TV's were set to the pregame shows and the volume was so loud my husband and I couldn't converse.  We ask them to turn it down and they said no.  We told them to cancel our order and went to Village Inn.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We were just eating at Haymaker, awesome food and great employees. Our night was going good until the couple next to us started complaining about the big doors being open. Its a bar.... its beautiful outside, this is Arizona whuch is one of the few places you can keep the doors open in December. Didnt seem like anyone else was complaining and my family really enjoyed the view. Dont let one person ruin your evening,  or your view of the Haymaker.  It is family friendly and the management there is awesome!."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food that is really good. Heather the mngr is available and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I asked for a former menu item met with no! It was a grilled cheese(cheese witch  they have,  and bacon they have, and tomato grilled cheese, they have,on grilled bread, which they have. Don't go. Not worth it. Was better before. Don't care about the games. Care about the care. They have none. Reboot I get it. Not caring about retention which is your annuity GET IT. Won't be back. Will miss you haymaker. New GM bitched about her hours.... Really. Companied  to me about your hours and can't cook a grilled cheese.... that's weak. Too bad Sorry you have to work so many hours. I am a manager at a well known valley restaurant. It's is what it is. If you don't want to be there then don't. Sorry to the bartender who was as shocked as me."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Haymaker for some time. We love the atmosphere and have some favorite dishes. Sal, at the bar, is great. He knows us and what we like and is always upbeat . We dropped in one night on a Wednesday expecting to see him only to find they changed his work days. Food and beverage was good as usual but we missed Sal! Glad to see him tonight!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and service was great! Our server, Mya, was on top of every order and met our requests quickly and efficiently. What a great Mothers Day experience!"}
{"text":"We went there and it didn't seem to be too terribly busy. We sat for probably 15 minutes while watching two servers talk to other tables and completely ignore us.  I was starting to wonder if there was an invisible cloak around us. Finally someone came to the table, I'll assume the manager and she took our order. We order appetizers.  Mushrooms, onion rings and their pulled pork nachos. the Onion rings were really good! The mushrooms were a'ight, but the nachos were really mediocre.  I've never really experienced COLD nachos before this.  But looks like they put cheese sauce on tortilla chips and then put cold pulled pork and the other cold items right on top of it.  Not the best."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to restaurant, but no more.  It is now just another sports bar.  No more booths, bar side tables with high chairs are now the norm.  They are definitely not kid or senior citizen friendly. The remodel is cold, they have added pool tables in what used to be the front dining room.  A shuffle board now occupies the far south wall eliminating the booths.  It might be what the younger crowd wants but not this former regular.  To cover the cost of new exterior paint and interior remodeling they have reduced their menu selections.  Prices are HIGHER.  The Thursday burger special was $7.50 before, now it is $9.00.  This type of price increase is shown all over the new menu.  The food was still good, just not worth the new pricing, especially for someone on a fixed income. When the snowbirds return in a few months, I am positive they will come in and the look on their faces will be similar to our's, asking themselves what the hell happened!  It is no longer warm and welcoming, it is cold and cookie cutter sports bar. If Haymaker's is still here by Jan 2018 I will be totally surprised"}
{"text":"This place totally sucks their food is definitely average and cheap for reason. Came here on a Sunday for breakfast and the service was OK but I wouldn't go back probably. If I hadAnother place to choose for breakfast. I would probably go there. Maybe even McDonald's. Also note, I had a Mimosa And it was definitely orange juice."}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly and it was a nice environment. We only saw or waitress a few times and there was a lot of tone between her visiting our table - it seems they don't have sections and she had tables all over the restaurant. The mimosas had a lot of pulp, which some people like, but I don't prefer. I ordered the pulled pork skillet and was disappointed. The potatoes were soft and not crispy; I expected the pulled pork to have bbq sauce and it didn't; and it was watery. The salsa Verde was delicious though. Overall it was okay. Not the best brunch place in the area, but if you want bottomless tiny mimosas this is your place. Otherwise, stick with lunch/dinner/late night drinks."}
{"text":"Always my go to spot for food and drinks!  Today was the worst experience I have ever had there.  And mind you, we go atleast once a week!  Tyler, the new bartender, was failing miserably! Ordered a \"signature\" cocktail - I had to tell him it was missing an ingredient.  We ordered an appetizer and my salad came out first.  I had to  remind him of our appetizer.  When he brought it out - it was the wrong one!  C'mon dude!  I've been in the industry for years.  If you pay attention its not difficult!  If it were one mistake, no worries!  But it ruined our entire experience! ....oh and his constant whistling"}
{"text":"This is a great local bar! Food is awesome and lots of TV's with sports. The staff is great especially the bartender Paige! She is amazing! Definitely worth stopping in for some great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Used to like this place but not anymore sadly. We had loved it as our neighborhood bar. The remodel looks nice but service and food quality has gone way downhill. On our last two visits (one on a weeknight the other on a Sat morning) it took 20 minutes to even place our order, and then we waited over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Most recently we were at the table for 50 minutes before we had food in front of us! The service is friendly but it seems like they're always short-staffed. Probably short-staffed in the kitchen as well. The food isn't as good either. The chilaquiles were not good at all- tasted like it was all out of a can.  On a plus, their food is very gluten-free friendly. (Except for when the waitress told me that Bud Light is GF, but I think she was just misinformed.)"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, and saw they had $3 bloody Mary's. We stopped in and the staff was friendly and efficient. We ordered off of the brunch menu and the food was good and came out quickly. We may have found our neighborhood go-to spot!"}
{"text":"This place looks GREAT! I am so impressed by the remodel. It is an awesome neighborhood bar now. Shuffleboard, pool, golden tee, darts and Touch Tones! The customer can control the music. Love it! Plus the new menu offers the best of the old stuff and some new delicious items. I will definitely be frequenting this place!!! Good Job!!!"}
{"text":"Great for a weeknight burger and beer! Staff was very friendly too and lots of tvs to catch live sports action! Next time i may try happy hour though cause it was a bit pricey"}
{"text":"I think this place is great! I know some people loved the old place, but I think they have done a great job creating a spot to grab a couple of beers some food and a game. This area is lacking a local sports bar, this place fills that void. Good beer selection, good food, and plenty of views of the game. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Seems unjust for a business to do a remodel  and add sports grill to their name and they receive a fresh start on Yelp. That's not right. Let's be real here. I had a series of reviews on their original page. Messages between the owner even. This is not a hot new business. Yes remodeled and new business plan but same business. I have been there twice since it has been updated. Once with just my husband and then again on 4th of July with 8 people. The first time receiving a free meal because I had yelped a lower star rating while I was at my table. I am truly Glad to see they are doing better because a successful local business is better than an empty one, but I am no longer a fan. I just think Yelp is wrong letting them start over with reviews. Seems unfair."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and always request Paige. She has a great personality and our conversations always flow nicely. I've never seen her have a bad day because our service has never been affected. Speaking to the restaurant it's always clean and staffed appropriately. I wish they had hotter sauces for their wings but the quality of the food is top notch. Beer is chilled at the right temperature. I just can't say enough, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"During my travels & stays, I get to experience many types of cuisine. At first, I said to myself, okay, yet another sports grill.  Upon seating however, I quickly changed my mind. There were total of 8 people in our party. Our server, Eden, was very attentive and visited our table often without being too pushy as a 'salesperson' who is jockeying for more drinks, more appetizers, more food, etc.  Now for the food. I would say this is about the best place to get Fish & Chips. The portions were generous, but above all, the taste was excellent. Thank you Miss Eden, for a very pleasant dining experience. Good show!"}
{"text":"Cool place to grab a bite to eat and a drink. Good food and portions. They also have a groupon!!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant staff and manager. The appetizers are all excellent. The French dip sandwich and fish and chips are also very tasty and you get a nice portion. Great place to try if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch for the first time. I'll start by saying the cinnamon roll was phenomenal and you can tell it's made from scratch. Our entrees were good and service quick, however, where they fail is the so called \"bottomless mimosas\". They are $15 for starters, most other restaurant's are $12 aka Market Street Kitchen and The Creek Patio Grill both favorites of ours. After the 2nd mimosa, I asked for one without orange juice because the citrus was getting to me. I was informed the pour would be smaller then. 1st of all the flutes are already only filled halfway, what? And when you do not get OJ, you are looking at a shot of cheap sparking wine. WOW! Needless to say DO NOT ORDER $15 bottomless mimosas, because you are actually getting $15 BOTTOMLESS ORANGE Juice."}
{"text":"great sports bar! staff was so friendly and helpful! the pbbj cheeseburger was amazing! def going back!"}
{"text":"This place was empty when I went in, so I actually left without trying anything the first time. I was only looking for a beer. An hour later I stumbled in again and sat down and got a White Chocolate by Sonoran Brewery. I noticed that the beer selection was pretty vast, which is pretty good in my book. I ordered the Arizona Eggrolls and waited a pretty long time for them, BUT they were the best damn thing I have ever ate. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill on a Sunday morning and I was hungry . So I thought I would go to a sports bar and catch part of playoffs and get some breakfast. I had driven by this place many times but never went there. As other reviews indicate they have just renovated and switched to the sports bar format. I saw some not so flattering reviews but figured how can someone screw eggs and toast but apparently I was wrong. Their saving Grace is their staff who are friendly and attentive. I ordered an omelette which comes with potatoes and toast and ordered a cup of coffee. The coffee was OK. The breakfast came out fast (they were mildly busy at the time). The omelette was bland and cheese was all on one side of the omelette. The potatoes (diced) we're horrible. Some of them were burned to crisp and rest of them were partially cooked and tasted like almost raw potatoes would. You can see the dice was not even so smaller and thinner potatoes got burned and rest were partially cooked. I probably would stay away from this spot. Its not worth it."}
{"text":"Menu looked good and beer selection was pretty good. Tatiana was our server and it was awful. Took ten minutes for waters then fifteen minutes after we ordered our food, she then told us they were t even serving fish and chips. The food was very greasy. Waited 45 minutes until we had to get up and ask for a box and our check. She was standing at the computer able to see our table the e tire time and was not busy. We will not be going back. Two hours for three appetizers and a beer."}
{"text":"I'm not one to easily complain about restaurant service. Everyone has better days than others. But the quality of service in this place was actually the WORST I've ever had. My girlfriend and sat ourselves at a table in the bar and waited for 10 min for a server to even just acknowledge us. Nothing. So I go stand at the bar to order a drink. Bartender looks around, takes care of a couple of other people while I patiently wait...and then walks into the kitchen for 8 min. We finally flag down a waitress, give her a beer order and ask for menus. 20 min later still no beers. Finally gave up and left. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Great atmosphere, plenty of parking and great food. PBJ burger is amazing. Nice size bar and open patio during good weather. Well worth checking out"}
{"text":"Always have loved coming here on a Sunday. But today was the worst experience ever. I think my server Christopher must've had a bad night.  He was rude. Yawning as he delivered food or took orders. Not a pleasant experience. I sat on patio and had my dog with me. She was in a bag. He was shaking his head whenever he came out. Prob will be a while before I come back."}
{"text":"Haymakers is a place we visit when 2 situations combine:  1. I have a coupon 2. We find ourselves nearby out of ideas on where to eat.  Service is usually friendly, and the food is decent. It is just that somehow we don't feel the love and we don't really have any favorites, so we do not come here often.  It could also be that every time we have been seated by the bar, and that is never our first option.  We have been here for breakfast and early dinner, and they do have good options. This last time both me and hubby had the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and they were very good.  I have also had BBQ chicken (sauce on the side) and ribs in the past, both good too."}
{"text":"WON'T BE BACk!  I have been going here for almost a year now but this place has continuously gone down hill the past couple months.  I walked into the restaurant last night to watch the game and was verbally attacked by a waitress wearing a cross-fit shirt.  Within seconds of entering the establishment she said \"I don't like your shirt!\" with a smirk on her face. I was wearing a sports t-shirt supporting my team and apparently she was rooting for the other. I felt very unwelcome and should've left at that point.  But I did stay and ordered the pastrami burger which was good.  My friend's sweet potato fries were small and greasy and were more soggy than crispy. Some were almost black in color and were unappetizing.  The fries used to be a lot bigger and tasted better.  Our waitress did initially check on us but then ignored us for 15 minutes.  As I've heard the management has recently changed.  While improvements have been made they have not been service or food focused.  The huge tv on the side wall composed of 9 large TVs is a great addition, unfortunately I did not discover them until I went to the restroom just before leaving because it's hidden back in a corner.  I hope for the future customers' sake that improvements will be put into the service and food in lieu of more TVs."}
{"text":"I am writing an update to my review. As mentioned before we LOVE this place. I spoke to Mandy, the GM today, and our conversation was everything I hoped and expected. Mandy was a good listener and attentive. We will continue to go to our favorite spot for fried zucchini. Looking forward to our next visit!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, very typical bar food menu. Tastes straight from the freezer. Waitresses are the worst."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Haymaker at this location and have been to their Peoria location as well.  They've remodeled the inside from a family friendly restaurant to a bar. With that came a smaller menu and increased pricing.  My review of the decor and ambiance is a slight upgrade from a Dive Bar. Gray coloring, random bar swag abound on the walls, and the best 80's track lighting mounted overhead.  The food....well let's just say don't go hungry. I'm a foodie and regularly pay $12-$15 for a good to great burger. Theirs are around $13, but whereas, $8-$10 would have been extremely cordial if they were tasty. When my burger arrived I had to question if it was the kid's burger. Very small and burnt, even though I ordered medium. The meat is flawed with NO FLAVOR but the bacon shined through. I later asked how many ounces, which I was told 7oz and hand made. Trust me, it was never 7oz even before they doubly killed it.  On the lighter side, their apple cider vinegarette was sensational. As was the kind attentive service.  So, I went back after the remodel and menu change but WILL NOT be going back. I was deeply disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened. Initially there were some specials during trivia on Wednesday evenings, but management has changed a few times. We LOVE the staff, always attentive, friendly and one of the reasons we come back. Recently management changed again and is the reason for this post. The changes with food are not for the better. Removed the Zucchini, changed the fries from these yummy thick steak fries to these wimpy, stringy, soggy fries that are just gross. We have tried many menu items and most items pretty mediocre. The wings, the french dip, and fish and chips are good. Would be nice to have some specials during trivia. The inconsistency is the main issue. It seems like every month there is a new menu. Thanks to Mandy for always being so amazing, I know it must be hard with customers asking about all the menu changes. We will be back for Trivia, but I can't say we will continue to eat here anymore.."}
{"text":"If you haven't been in here yet it should deffinatly be a bucket list destination! If you like sports and great food, you will fit in well. Drink prices and happy hour are great! New menu roll out has been delicious! I recommend sitting at the bar where Paige can take care of you. I've been coming in for quite some time and always receive top of the line service. She is amazing, remembering her return guests by name. As well as their drink order! She is prompt and fun, which is key for a bartender. Love her to pieces! Over all have never had a bad experience! Dont miss out."}
{"text":"I must say, seeing some of these reviews of how business is after the re-model, I was a little hesitant going in, even with a Groupon in hand.  Given some past poor experiences, I expected this to be even worse.  Not so.  Now, I do prefer the family-style restaurant they had (and this is from a guy who loves sports bars/grills).  I loved the fact you could go to the bar or stay in the restaurant.  Now, its just wide open.  It looks really nice though.  Pretty busy for a Saturday lunch!    The food is a bit more expensive and I'm not a fan of places jacking up prices just because they can, and I think because of the re-model they did just that.  It's not all bad though.  Some of the favorites are still part of the menu.  The food was very good.  I had the BLAT and my wife had the Blackened Chicken Sandwich, which I got to taste - both VERY good.    Our service was very good.  Our server actually paid attention to us.  This is one of the biggest issues I've had with this place in the past.    You also can't beat $2 domestic pints all weekend.  You won't find that anywhere else, at least in that area.  I may have found a place to go to for NFL Sunday's from time to time.  So, while the experience didn't blow me away, it was certainly good enough for me to comment on it and tell people to give it a try.  I can't promise everyone will have the same experience I had (because after all, consistency was an issue I had here before re-model) but take other reviews to heart but also go into your experience with an open mind.  If its bad, just please share but if its good, also please share!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, service and the staff is all amazing and fun!!!! Can't beat 2$ domestic drafts for football. Paige and Ryan are great!"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome very friendly, professional and never have a bad experience there! We have been going for years that is our go to local restaurant. We have been there Family gatherings, Sunday football, quick bite to eat or just for a weekday dinner. Cannot day enough how good we are treated by staff"}
{"text":"Ryan, our  bartender was great...very busy working by himself but provided great service. The wings were dry and tasteless, and the pulled pork nacho's were so bad who the hell uses Velveeta cheese on nacho's.and the pork was tasteless..disgusting. VERY DISAPPOINTING."}
{"text":"When this place opened two years ago I liked it and it became a Happy Hour or \"grab a few drinks with the guys\" staple.  They had slightly better than average bar food and an excellent selection of spirits, beer too.  The wait staff was a little hit and miss and some of the employees exhibited some questionable behavior.  They also had a good crowd on Friday evenings, as we had to wait a couple of times for a seat.    Fast forward a year from the opening.  They tired to reinvent the place to a degree, which I'm cool with.  They sized down their menu and got rid of almost all of their higher-end spirits.  That's fine if you exchange the quantity of your selections with higher quality food.  I would argue that with the change, both the quantity of selection and quality of food went down a notch.    Then over the next few months so did the quality of the wait staff and the care put into the overall establishment.  We had a couple of experiences where the attitude of the server was borderline \"why are you bothering me\".  One time, after trying to grab the attention of a few of the wait staff to grab our drinks that had been sitting at the station on the end of the bar, I finally walked up and grabbed them myself.  This happens from time to time at places, but seems to be the rule and not the exception when I have been in.  Last time I was in I noted that they had redone their TV system.  I've attached a picture.  This jumble of wires sits in the middle of the place with no attempt made to conceal it from the patrons.  If this little care is put into the public areas of the business, image what the status of the kitchen is."}
{"text":"Good hamburgers, omelettes. Large portions. Average priced. Rustic ambience. Loud, annoyed music. Large selection of beers."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Crowded with only 2 servers that we saw. It didn't bother us because we enjoyed sitting outside and weren't under time pressure.  We had chicken fried steak with eggs. The steak was run of the mill size and quality. The eggs and gravy were good but restaurants are now using medium sized eggs. Some even state so on the menu. GEEZ, 20 cents more for a dozen large eggs at grocery store prices. Wholesale probably less.  My companion liked the biscuit and I thought it was just OK.  The worst part was the under cooked potatoes. The only thing worse than under cooked potatoes is under cooked chicken."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience at the Haymaker. We held our Christmas party there and Christopher was our server. We had our own room next to the pool tables. We ordered drinks and appetizers. The Cajun quesadilla is delicious. A little spicy but great flavor. The salad with apples and nuts had a delicious dressing. Everyone loved the egg rolls, wings, zucchini and mozz sticks. The service was fantastic and everyone there was very friendly and welcoming. This is a great place for groups! Or you can sit in the dining area where there are plenty of TVs to watch the game. It's definitely got a sports bar feel to it but it's not so loud that you can't have a conversation. Tons of parking! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food is delicious with generous serving sizes. Ryan bartender, Mandy manager, Callin assistant manager, and Chris server, are beyond awesome! Fast service with great customer service. My favorite sports bar and grill for sure, hands down. Anybody looking for a new friendly spot, I suggest you try it out!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great atmosphere and kind staff.  Mandy is the best!  We enjoy he happy hour and the taco night!"}
{"text":"This location used to be a restaurant and they are now just a sports bar serving a fraction of the menu they did before. Even the cocktail menu is pared down from what it was.    I had the Mac & Cheese (build your own) and it was flavorless and mushy.  My husband had the Arizona burger, and said it was decent, as it was before.  His onion rings were good too.  The seating area is MUCH smaller now too.   Service was fine.  I'm really bummed!  We used to go here quite a bit, but we won't be back.  Bet they won't be around long in this format. :("}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Service is extremely slow, fromTime to take your order, to getting food and then again waiting to get the bill.   Server was MIA most of the time.   Don't know that we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed to give this place such a low review. We looked forward to trying this place out, I gave them 2 stars because I think underneath it all there is some potential if someone steps in and cleans things up. We visited on a Friday at lunchtime, it was not busy at all so we expected swift service. We had extremely slow service from a server who has clearly never waited tables before. She never one time cleaned a single plate or napkin from our table, never refilled a drink, we had to hunt down our own silverware, etc. We had to send back an appetizer for inadequate temperature issues (it was refunded, however we were skiddish about the protein temperature on the replacement appetizer and didn't eat that either). The rest of the food was adequate at best. The rest of the staff seemed friendly and the atmosphere seemed welcoming, but our experience was a huge fail. We will not be coming back. Hoping for the owners sake that they can address some of their issues and turn this place around!"}
{"text":"Super service at the bar. Immediate service to an older single woman. Unusual. Lots of exciting things on the menu. Great selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I love this place, but it has changed so much. I don't care about the remodel or that the menu has changed. I go to places because of the service. Sal, Travis and Ryan are great and I go because of them a few times a week. The management turnover has been awful however. The new GM doesn't care about her staff or the customers. This is a sports bar, not Dominicks. It's a simple business model, serve decent food and drinks and kill them with kindness to keep them coming back. I have been coming here since day one and have received nothing but great service, but I can tell the vibe has changed from the leadership from the top. The staff walks around like they are on egg shells and I can tell they are not happy. I have given gifts to the staff and even money because that's what I do. But to be questioned about a heavy tip from management is ridiculous. Not sure I will be back, but if I do, it will because of the staff that I have grown to enjoy. Not the management.  I can tell you many regulars feel the same way and will be moving on unless something changes. Good luck, I hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears."}
{"text":"We much prefer the restaurant feel of the peoria location. This location is a sports bar. The chicken sandwhich was okay but I recommend the burgers instead. However their wings are still the best in town and we appreciate how gluten free friendly it is!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here like 3 restaurants ago. This is our go to spot. Today put a bad taste in our mouths. We love Paige and Crystal but today was horrible. Our order well was out of order, was wrong and took forever. We will def give it another chance but as a new named bar you need to get it together!"}
{"text":"Great food and the BEST service from Mya, our server. She made our experience so nice!"}
{"text":"I got a $10 off $20 coupon and need to find a sports bar for Sunday football in my new neighborhood. Had the hot bone in wings and the pick your own pasta and cheese. The wing flavor was first rate. Only 8 wings for $9, but unfortunately this has become the norm for wings in Phx (what happened to $6 for a dozen wings in this town). With the pasta you get to choose shells or rotini, then 2 kinds of cheese, then three add ins, plus you can add meat for $3. I got roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, and cilantro for add ins and went with bleu cheese and brie for the cheeses. The cheese combo wasn't great (this was my fault not there's). The add ins were pretty minimal, meaning hard to find. It was served in a little skillet that had me wondering where they would put the meat if it was ordered as well. I don't think I'd order the pasta again, $8.5 for the size was pretty steep IMO. Weekend domestic drafts were $2 a pint, smoking deal there. I'll definitely be back, but just not enough TV's to be my regular spot for Sunday morning football. My minimum criteria is being able to sit at a table where I can see at least 8 different games at once for fantasy football."}
{"text":"We've been regulars here for a long time. The great food and patio have kept us coming back. However it's my understanding new owners took over recently, and since then the food has been very disappointing. The chicken wings seem like lower quality meat (and in a full order I only got one paddle piece and the rest were drumettes full of gristle). The sweet potato fries that were once big and crispy came as a big soggy lump soaked in grease. Ordered a brunch item this morning that was supposed to have shredded chicken but there was no chicken and just a big plate of soggy nacho chips drenched in some kind of brown sauce. First time I've had to send back food here. Thankfully our waitress was very apologetic and took it off the check. It's sad because I would've rated this place 4 stars or higher before the new owners took over. Hope they take a hard look at their food quality and the folks they have cooking it. My advice: don't fix it if it's not broken!"}
