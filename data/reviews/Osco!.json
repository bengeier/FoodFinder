{"text":"Great breakfast buffet. Even better that it's complimentary for me and my friend. Endless bacon and crepes with maple butter as well as good quality fresh fruit. Good service and staff as well. Such a treat. Very pricey if you are paying $21++ for breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"Food was okay but terrible service. When we told our waiter that we received the wrong dish he said he would look into it and then avoided us for the rest of the night. He was very rude and condescending about it.  We ended up leaving early because of how bad it was, but we were still charged for the wrong meal and desert which we did not receive. It's the closest I've come to leaving without paying. Not a good start to our honeymoon."}
{"text":"Average and overrated. Not to be chosen if your looking for a great culinary experience. Think upscale chain style restaurant. Lacks  personality or personal care, a business lacking soul. The decor is uninspired trendy and suburban."}
{"text":"Absolutely average food. Went for taste of Montreal. The restaurant could have tried a little harder to bring diners back. Too many other much better restaurants in Montreal"}
{"text":"Osco is a modern French establishment located at the InterContinental. The service here is very good. Great wine list as well. The food is also great. I had a risotto and duck confit. While the duck was not the best I've had, it was still very good and prepared to my expectations. Risotto was good, too."}
{"text":"J'ai soupé au Osco avec 3 amis, lors du Oystermania en avril dernier. Les huitres étaient des Beausoleil, elles étaient très bonnes, grosses et il n'y avait pas de présence de morceaux d'écaille. Le tout fût servi avec des tranches de citron et lime, ainsi que la mignonette traditionnelle et de la sauce Tabasco (à notre demande).  Par la suite, gourmande que je suis, j'ai commandé le mac n' cheese au homard. Il était très bon; la sauce goûtait beaucoup le homard et il y avait une bonne quantité de morceaux de chaire de homard. J'aurais peut être juste aimé que ça goûte un peu plus le fromage. Mes amis eux se sont partagé une assiette de nachos, qui était bien aussi. Leila a aussi reçu une crème brulée pour le dessert, qui était vraiment délicieuse, onctueuse et riche, avec un agréable parfum de vanille française.  En tout et partout, ce fût une excellente expérience Oystermania; nous avons beaucoup aimé les huitres Beausoleil. Nous avons aussi bien aimé les autres assiettes que nous avons commandés, pour nous accompagner dans notre visionnement des Canadiens en séries (malheureusement, la soirée ne s'est pas aussi bien passée pour eux que pour nous). Nous avons aussi beaucoup aimé l'atmosphère chaleureux du resto.  Pour ma critique complète et plus de photos, allez voir mon blogue: Turquoise Blog (lien dans ma bio!)"}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast in the hotel pretty much every day before starting out. They have an excellent breakfast buffet and fantastic coffee. After night after night of drinking and excess this nice place is a perfect start to another day in this beautiful city. If you just want something quick and dont want to leave the hotel, head down to the lobby and stop in here. It is good!"}
{"text":"Average food. Overpriced. Small portions. Waiters give the attitude that they are running behind all the time so even if you have a question or two about something else, you would feel shy to ask! I even asked about if anything was special in the breakfast buffet and the reply was \"Go see by yourself\" cut n dry! And then ran away! Nice seating though."}
{"text":"Provincial fish soup for taste of mtl was so bad. Like awful. No, it was really bad. I don't think you get how bad it was.  Deserts were the best part of the 3 course meal.   Scallops were sandy :(  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine. J'ai eu l'occasion d'y aller 5 ou 6 fois au cours de la dernière année, que ce soit le soir ou le midi, j'ai toujours été impressionné par la qualité des plats servis. Les ravioles et les risottos sont absolument divins. Allez-y un midi de semaine et faites vous une opinion, le menu du jour est très abordable (moins de 30$/pers) et comprend entrée-plat-café."}
{"text":"Nous aimons séjourner à l'hôtel intercontinental mais n'avions jamais essayé son restaurant pour le souper... Seulement pour le déjeuner buffet inclus dans certain forfait et c'est vraiment succulent. Pour le Déjeuner je donne sans aucune hésitation un 5 étoiles. Concernant le resto, l'atmosphère y est particulièrement chaleureuse et enveloppante avec ses banquettes bien coussinées et intimes dans de petits cocons. C'est une formule tapas mais un peu plus gros. 2 à 3 plats par personne fait l'affaire. Horsmon chum et moi avons essayé 7 plats à deux! Mon chuma trippé moi j'ai aimé mais je n'y retournerait pas. Mais je suis contente de l'avoir essayé. Le service est parfait. Et le bar d'absinthe SarahB, est très bien. On y a mangé une assiette de nachos. Pour 7 plats 142$... Un peu cher ! Le menu change avec les saisons."}
{"text":"Nous sommes venus dans le cadre de Montréal à Table.  C'est à l'intérieur d'un hôtel proche du palais des congrès. Le restaurant est sympathique, cela fait assez hôtel donc rien de bien extravagant. Le service était bien à l'écoute et avec des bons conseils dans les plats. Au niveau des plats c'était assez classique mais bon.  En entrée nous avons pris :    - Carpaccio de pieuvre grillée, émulsion d'olives Kalamata, piment habanero et pommes paille Yukon : attention au piment qui est vraiment piquant et qui vous détruit la bouche et le palais. J'Ai trouvé qu'il manquait un assaisonnement au niveau de la pieuvre qui est juste grillé. Pas vraiment un carpaccio à mon sens ...    - Tartare de canard mi-cuit, figues, noix de pin, légumes croquants et betteraves au vieux Banyuls : pas mal, j'ai préféré à l'autre entrée Début mitigé pour les entrées.  Pour les plats :    - Médaillons de buf en croûte de cèpes, choux rouge au lard fumé, crosnes et pommes Dauphine au poivre rare : viande très bien cuite et la croute de cèpes lui donne un petit plus.    - Risotto, pétoncles, homard, crevettes, asperges et crème d'Absinthe : très bon rissoto, parfaitement assaisonné et crémeux comme il le faut. Les plats rehaussent le niveau, Les portions sont corrects, j'avais un peu peur de ne pas trop mangé dans ce restaurant mais ça va au final. C'est classique comme plat, sans grande folie mais bien fait.  Pour les desserts :     - Pommes façon \" pastis \", caramel pacane et fleur de sel : il n'y a pas de pastis dans ce plat ;) c'est vraiment bon, l'ensemble va parfaitement bien ensemble.    - Dacquoise au citron vert et noix de coco : bien frais pour finir et assez léger. Cela ne bourre pas. L'ensemble est bon !  En conclusion nous avons bien mangé mais le menu proposé était trop classique à mon gout. Je ne blâme pas le restaurant car on y est allé en connaissance de cause (le menu est communiqué avant). J'aurais bien mis 3.5* mais je ne veux pas mettre 4 donc je laisse à 3. C'est plus un ressentis personnel qu'un constat sur la qualité des plats proposés.  SI vous voulez manger des plats classiques maîtrisés venez ici, si vous chercher de la folie dans votre assiette ou des plats classiques revisités cherchez ailleurs.  Je dirais pour finir que la qualité est au rdv :)"}
{"text":"Lovely service and a leisurely meal.  Have to remember we're not in the United States and that meals are taken seriously and should be enjoyed. I and my friends spit split a Cesar salad with salmon and then I had the grilled appetizer of octopus which was very tasty would order that again."}
{"text":"My parents are in the market for a more upscale joint, the type that doesn't advertise itself as \"classy\", you know? So naturally they started to look into hotel restaurants. So out of the blue we went to the Old Port, and ended up in the beautiful Intercontinental. Right off the bat, I'm smitten with a place that has a couch for you to wait on. Fancy! You'll be glad to know that the restaurant passes the bathroom test with flying colors, but what about the food? The appetizers were lovely, I had some eggplant cakes, my father chose fat slices of salmon, but my mother hit the jackpot with the fried calamari. Those were among the best fried things I have eaten! We selected the table d'hôte, (which is a blackboard brought to your table). The mixed grill platter was humongous and looked pretty great, but nowhere was it written that my seafood casserole would be 75% rice! Hey!   I liked the decor, which was pretty cosy (you get to sit in armchairs!) but it seems Osco! has a bit of an identity crisis: is it hip? or is stuffy better suited to the premises? Gaah! As some point the jazzy lounge sounds just got irritating. Speaking of irritating, look, my parents know they got an accent, but after two decades of Quebec potholes, winters and construction seasons, it's grating to sit down for a fine dining experience, and have the waiter go: \"So you must be tourists! What brings you here?!\". And SHUT IT DOWN. Also, we sorta wanted to celebrate Mother's day, so it wasn't too cool on the staff's part to care mainly about my dad. So ladies, flash a wallet."}
{"text":"This restaurant was conveniently located inside the hotel we stayed at in Montreal. So we decided to give it a try. Came here for a snack before dinner. Looked at the menu but felt like there was not much to eat. We ordered the foie gras. It was foie gras pate. Was cold which I didn't like that much. I prefer my foie gras seared. We were thinking  about ordering the beef tartare but decided not to. But the waiter came by with the beef tartare anyways and said it was complementary on the house. The beef tartare was pretty good. I liked it better than the foie gras we ordered. But not worth the price.   We also ordered room service and the food was made by this restaurant. Had the salmon. But the salmon seemed overcooked and bland. There was barely any flavour and it was dry. The vegetables that came along the dish tasted like frozen veggies that were microwaved. Pretty disappointing.   Overall, this restaurant has really nice decor and friendly staff members but the food isn't good."}
{"text":"Wow this is long overdue. For the end-of-the-year celebration with my girlfriend in 2015, we visited Osco for a nice meal. We didn't expect any special menu that week but were pleasantly surprised with a 3-course meal for $35/person. At that I was a bit skeptical, wondering if the food quality will be sacrificed because of such value that was being offered, like what we often see during the Restaurant Week in many NY restaurants.  Boy was I wrong. I think the Chef took extra care in preparing our meal, because everything that went into my mouth that day was fantastic, not to mention that it was visually appealing when presented to our table. I never knew an octopus meat that I was given for appetizer in generous portions could be so tender and soft. The piece of steak that I ordered for the main entree was far better than what they serve in dedicated steakhouses.   When I inquired about absinthe since I never had an opportunity to try before, our waiter was kind enough to passionately give a short history lesson, and suggested a few cocktail combinations that are great with absinthe - which just turned out to be as great as he mentioned.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with the experience that Osco allowed me to take that night."}
{"text":"Total rip off. Ravioli tasted fantastic but only 3. Appetizer size for $18!. Offered water nonsparkiling charged $6. Once bitten twice shy."}
{"text":"Wow!  I ate here while staying at the InterContinental Hotel, and I was thrilled!  For dinner, I had the calamari as the appetizer, which was one of the best I've ever had.  The ribsteak was also amazing.  My wife ate the salmon tartar, which was also amazing.  The next morning, we ate at the breakfast buffet, which had a great selection of cereals, breads, and omelettes.  In particular, the crepes with maple syrup was simply out of this world.  I can't speak highly enough about this restaurant.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Being conveniently located in the InterContinental Montréal definitely helped my friend and I's decision to have dinner here. Just a short elevator ride from our room and the waiter took us to a table by the window where we could watch the sunset.   The waiter informed us of the specials after we had a brief look at the menus (paper version and tablet version). The seafood risotto he told us of sounded delectable so we went with that and crab cakes. My friend thought that the risotto could be creamier and cheesier but I thought that it was just right. Any more cheese or cream would've made it too heavy for me and I would not have finished it. There was a large clam, piece of lobster, 2 large shrimp/prawns, small muscles in the risotto.  I thought that prices weren't that high considering it's a restaurant in a high end hotel and the service was wonderful.  Breakfast: The thing that impressed me most about breakfast was the fact that there was smoked salmon. I don't think I've seen this offered during breakfast at any other hotel I've stayed at before. There was the usual suspects of pastries, sliced bread, baguette, sliced meat, eggs, pancakes (cut in half in case you don't want a full one), bacon, sausages, fruit, cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, and, what is sometimes offered, an omelette station."}
