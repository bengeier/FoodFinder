{"text":"Amazing fish and chips, probably my favourite in the area. The interior is set up really simply but who cares about fancy when you just want some good fish and chips. Really fast service too!"}
{"text":"The batter on the fish was too heavy, and it wasn't seasoned.  The chips were good,  nice and crispy on the outside,  still tender inside"}
{"text":"Love this place. I ordered haddock with poutine, shrimp, cod and chips. Everything ordered was fresh and delicious. The poutine has to be one of my favorites and I cherish it so much since I live in the states and not many places serve it here. 5 stars all the way for mccowan fish and chips"}
{"text":"I was greeted nicely by the owner as I came in to order for takeout. I got the halibut &chips and chicken fingers & chips.  I would rate the halibut 3/5 and chicken 3/5 as well.  The fries tho, good.  Portions were decent."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. As someone who doesnt eat much fish, i was pleasantly surprised. I personally had the halibut and chips, and a can of iced tea. Cost about 12 - 13 bucks. Very tasty meal. A huge bonus was the unlimited tartar sauce. That's a huge plus. My only complaint was that the portions were light in my opinion as I devoured the meal in no time, and had to order another!"}
{"text":"Got the haddock fish and chips; it was highly recommended by the owners. It costs 11.25 with tax, not including tips, and comes with 4 ounces of fish and an abundance amount of fries. Fish is battered really well and is crispy, fluffy, and fish tastes really fresh. The fries are golden brown and goes well with the fries. They also have vinegar salt which I personally liked on my fries. The place has been open for 9 years and justifiably so. They have a dine in option with nice red tablecloths; definitely coming back again! 5 stars if I had it with beer"}
{"text":"I used to go to another fish/chip joint they sold the business it was bought and relocated. 
However this place was recommended and highly! We ordered the halibut with chips and a gravy on the side. Everything was perfect-even the gravy! 
You wont be disappointed, my order was hot fresh and the chips extra well done. How we like them! The fish a bit on the generous side and not a ton of batter on it either. 
The owner is always nice and friendly. 
Cheaper then my old fish joint too!!"}
{"text":"Best fish an chips I've ever had an the price was right. if you are looking for real English style fish an chips with real beer batter coating this is the place."}
{"text":"We read the reviews on Yelp and decided that since we were in the neighbourhood, we would give this a try.  We are from downtown Toronto and there are very few good (actually none) dedicated fish and chips stores.  This place was located in what appeared to be a derelict strip plaza and we were hesitant to enter, but we were pleasantly surprised.  There was a huge line up given that it was St. Patty's Day and also a Friday.  We instantly knew that we were onto something!

We entered the small dining room with one table taken with 4 elderly women.  We knew this place had to be good with the line up and the women at the table.  We both ordered halibut and chips from what appeared to be a very pleasant female Asian owner.  It is definitely a family owned business as you can see the children and the husband all in the open kitchen. 

Very quickly our steaming fresh fried F&C's appeared!  AYCE tartar sauce mimicked in the mustard bottle.  

Delicious home made (we think) cut fries and just melt-in-your-mouth batter for the halibut.  

A definite must!  Don't let the exterior fool you!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and definitely not the last.  Ordered the Halibut & Chips which tasted amazing.  It was not drenched in oil like some other places that I have been to.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for quality Fish & Chips in the East end."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and I can say, MMMMmmmmmm. This is a small place, I'd say less the a dozen tables. Food is great, Everyone now days are all about the burger, burgers everywhere, I remember when we used to be able to get decent fish & chips in your local mall. This stuff blows that stuff away by comparison, but it's hard to find good FNC any more, With the Hospital just  up the road, I hope they are making a killing."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was in elementary school. Hands down the best fish and chips place ever. Great prices. The portions are well but since the food is so good, youd want more of it.


The atmosphere is classic, the service is friendly. Definitely a gem in the ghetto of Scarborough. I live far away but every time I'm in the area I still find myself going back to this place.

Try the gravy. It's so good w the chips."}
{"text":"Excellent quality Halibut & chips for reasonable prices. The restaurant is extremely old school right down to the wood panelled walls but the food is great. The dining room service is mediocre, if they are busy you will wait. Friday's are extremely busy in this place for take out or dine-in. Even if you call ahead, they cook everything fresh so you will still wait a few minutes. The only think I don't enjoy is the coleslaw, it is the vinegar dressing slaw, not creamy and sweet so if you are not a fan of the vinegar dressing slaw, don't order it!"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced thick fillet of halibut paired with crisp home cut chips.  Batter was thin, crisp, but just a little too greasy.  BF had their black pudding platter with home made onion rings and commented that it was as good as the better known St. Andrew's Fish and Chips but at half the price and with better service.  I like St Andrew's too, but the prices here are very reasonable.

Service was quick and very friendly, and if you are looking for fresh and fast (and cheap) fish and chips, McCowan is a great spot. Brisk take-out business, but very attentive table service too."}
{"text":"Deep friend goodness! We got the large seafood platter with halibut, 4 shrimps, 4 scallops and chips; and the calamari

A good fish a chips to me is the right batter to seafood meat ratio and this place had that! The batter was flaky and delicious and the seafood meat portions were great. They could make the coleslaw servings larger but you can always ask for more. I love how they give you the squeeze bottles for all the condiments including their tartar sauce so you can refill your heart's desire and not have to fight with a packet of some sort!"}
{"text":"This is a small little restaurant on McCowan. Staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. We ordered the family size platter and a haddock on the size. The portions for decent size. The fries were delicious especially with their gravy. The fish was good but I would not say it is the best. The batter was not as great as expected. I had to ask for lemons on the side and they were brought to be extremely late. The other down fall was that we were done eating but had to wait 45 minutes for the bill!"}
{"text":"If you like real English style fish & chips this is the place to go. Handcut chips, crispy batter with tender moist flaky fish inside. Huge servings too!"}
{"text":"Date visited : Tues 04/10/2018

Service : 3/5
Friendly enough service.  We visited during around early dinner 18:00 EST.  Only 1 other couple was in the dining area.

Food : 3/5
My wife opted for the the Halibut and Chips and Haddock and Chips for myself.  A bit more pricey than our go to spot at Painted Post Fish and Chips.  

We received our orders in about 10-15 minutes, as for the dishes themselves, the fries were done extra crispy just the way we like without us requesting to be cooked as such.  As for the \"fish\" both the haddock and the halibut were tender and fresh not mushy or soggy.  Each of us received 1 decently sized piece of fish for our orders.  Batter wise I'd have to say it was light and crispy, less greasy than we have tried at other fish n chip spots.  I'd rate the oiliness at 3/5** (view rating list below).  For the price paid, would have been nice to have a bit more fries included with the order (we love our fries when they aren't frozen!)

Condiments :
Ketchup in a squeeze bottle, not sure on the brand or quality.  They have something that resembles tartar sauce, but it had a pink/orange tinge to it, which was also in squeeze bottle.  However, something in the tartar sauce was making my tongue tingle to almost a numbing sensation, I had consumed more of their tartar sauce than my wife, so she didn't notice a similar sensation on her tongue.  Since I have no idea what was/is the cause of that odd tingly/numbing sensation, I would caution other foodies with sensitive tongues to go easy on the custom tartar sauce that is provided to customers.  Take out packs of tartar sauce are available (not as flavorful, but likely without that tingly/numbing aspect), along with malt vinegar packets are available.

Beverages : 
We are kinda picky on our Water, not fond of tap water at all due to varying mineral content and sodium content, we usually bring our own from Home, since we buy 15L Ice River water and fill up reusable bottles.

Alternatively we opt to share a can of soda or Iced Tea.  Not many places offer filtered water as an option.  Also, not all bottled water is good quality.  At this venue they charge $1.00 + HST for a small glass of ice water with a 2 slices of lemon.

Other :
Parking is rather limited in the little strip.  However, there is additional parking in the adjacent plaza within walking distance.  Debit/cash accepted.  Hard to enter the parking lot if you are heading Southbound on McCowan, other drivers will likely not give way for you to turn in.  I had other drivers blasting their horns at me as I was waiting for a gap in the traffic flow.

Repeat visit ?
Possibly yes, a fellow friend on Yelp, had reviewed made in house fresh onion rings.  So may return to try the fresh onion rings.


Oiliness rating** :
1/5 very light and no oily after effect on tongue
2/5 still relatively light, Malt Vinegar/Lemon wedges not yet needed except by choice
3/5 medium level of oiliness; light effect on the tongue ; Malt Vinegar/Lemon wedges may be used to cut grease
4/5 starting to lean towards being heavy; greasiness now needing Malt Vinegar/Lemon Wedges to cut grease
5/5 very heavy and noticeable on the tongue, difficult to consume batter without Malt Vinegar/Lemon wedges"}
{"text":"Old school fish and chips Great service and friendly staff goid portions. I have only had the Halibut  it is very tasty and batter is crisp  Good  Coleslaw as well"}
{"text":"This place is an institution, and hasn't changed, ever. They have more regulars than the local dive bars. Their fish and chips are quite simply very good. I have gotten other things like their Calamari and onion rings, which were awesome too.  But I have probably eaten over 500 lbs of fish from this place, and I am not a fan of seafood.  But then deep fried halibut isn't really fishy.  At least not this place. 

Now, they don't do things like deep fried candy bars, but that's okay. There are other fish and chip places that are nearby that do. 

The price is average to low compared to other places that give the same fair.  But this place has a great puffy batter that isn't flavourless but doesn't overpower the fish. Another thing that stands out is their gravy. It might be preprocessed, but still good quality."}
{"text":"My mom ate there yesterday and within 20 minutes was sick. She got food poisoning and was throwing up & had diarrhea. When I called them to advise them to be more careful with their food, not only did they deny the claim but they said lack of hand washing would not cause someone to get sick. Clearly we know what the issue is here!!!"}
{"text":"Come here if you are craving some cheap and good fish and chips...this is not a place you would bring someone out on a date, restaurant is plain and run down. Portions are generous, though. Fries fill the plate all the way to the edges! Got the haddock and fries."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Scarborough with a friendly staff. High quality fish, not over cooked with tasty served fries! 

Has a cute hipster setting with authentic wallpaper and decor. 

The value you received is exceptional for the price you pay! Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"So, I came back after a long while because I was craving some fish and chips. The thing is, I didn't remember the fish and chips to be so...Greasy/oily. It was delicious, but it made me feel full right away because the amount of oil. It is crispy, but I don't know.. they missed the mark this time or maybe it was this greasy/oily the first time and I just didn't notice ?
However, with that being said,the service is really nice and friendly here. Not a long wait for food and they are pretty attentive. The portions are still very generous! 
I'd give it a try if you've never been here, just be warned that it's a little on the greasier side. I had the haddock and chips...Last time I had halibut so maybe that could've been a factor ? Not sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving for fish and chips and found this out of panic. We called in and they were still open, the lady was very friendly and happy. We ordered Haddock and Chips and Cod and Chips. When we got there to pick it up, the place was empty and looked outdated. The place i run by a chinese family, nice folks. Food was really oily. Cod and as the frozen kind and still had bone in it. Haddock was fresh and batter was good, not the best though."}
{"text":"I was really enjoying the Haddock and fries meal here it was sooooo very good. Until the last time I ate here I had a reaction to something in the food. Not sure till this day what it was. I couldnt even finish my meal which was a bummer. I wish people would clean tools properly. Maybe it was shrimp I dont know. It still is a good place, but if you have allergies beware!"}
{"text":"What a cute lil fish & chips place! The inside decor makes it feel very cozy and old-fashioned. The owners are a cute Asian couple, very nice. I got the cod & chips and it was a huge portion for such a good price. The cod was really light and crispy and very yummy with tartar sauce. The chips were of equal quality. Food definitely tasted fresh! This place seems to be an undiscovered Scarborough secret."}
{"text":"Another Scarborough gem. Service was quick, owner was really friendly, prices were just right & the food was cooked just right. Having eaten fish & chips around the world, i thought this hit the spot. Even my 6 year old, with his self diagnosed seafood allergy *eye roll* loved it. We had the seafood platter on a bitterly cold afternoon and it came to us fast & piping hot: scallops were not chewy & batter was light and crispy. I didn't like the side coleslaw though and I thought (later, after I scarfed it all down) that the batter was a little greasy."}
{"text":"This is a small family run fish and chips place that does it right. The batter on the halibut is light, and crispy with a crunch. Beautifully golden fried. The halibut steak itself is  a nice thick cut. I never eat the fries, cus I'm not a fan of thick cut greasy fries. 
If your in the mcowen and Lawrence area, try this place out. They also carry a great fishermans platter that's delicious and filling.
I haven't seen the condition of the bathroom but the place itself is clean and simple.

Simple food at its best."}
{"text":"Very oily & greasy. Fish has a nice thin batter around it, but could maybe use a little more flavour. Fries were super tasty, reminds me of B&B. Portions is decent too, the box looks small but I was getting pretty full by the end. Cost was under $10 without a drink. Decor looks kinda old school, it has its own character. The attendant (owners?) were friendly. Definitely a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of fish and chips from all over, London (UK) included. This little joint delivered in a great way. Haddock and chips had a great crust on it, was very tasty and filled me up. When I think of fish and chips, this is what I picture and all for a great price. This is a great and delicious value in the neighbourhood. The best fish and chips I've had in Toronto which isn't saying too much.. My only drawback was the coleslaw which needed a bit more of a bite! All said and done, I will be visiting on a bi-weekly basis. The service is kind and caring. Support locally, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best fish and chips I've had. The batter is crispy not greasy. Home fries are good too. Don't think anyone can complain about about this place other than the dated interior which is clean but is like your old auntie's house."}
{"text":"The  best Halibut fish and chips in Scarborough.  Friendly service as well and homemade tartar sauce."}
{"text":"Simply amazing fish and chips. Probably the best in the area. Very fast and friendly service. Price is good too."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. Don't take it to go for friends though. It goes real bad real quick when on road. Biscuits are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"How come I felt so comfortable eating at McCowan Fish & Chips?

Maybe I now finally to used to sketchy Scarborough strip plaza?

For a split second I almost thought I was in one of the Northern Chinese restaurants that I frequent and want to practice my Mandarin on my waiter!

You cannot blame me as all through my lunch I was listening to the two waiters chatting in Mandarin.

Cod Fish only ($5.50) is sizable. The batter is crispy and crunchy. The oil can be a little fresher but it is A-OK.

As usual, I tried one of the scallops and shrimps from my dinner mate's Seafood Platter (he offered, really he did! I didn't force him!) Both are not bad... but when I start eating deep fried heavy battered food, they kind of all tasted the same.

The service here is efficient and indifference... and of course remind me of the Chinese Joints I frequent!

See, now I know why I feel so comfortable eating at McCowan Fish & Chips!!"}
{"text":"This place is highly recommended by me: if you like fish and chips, you cannot go wrong here. 

I haven't had the cod, I went straight for the halibut. That, along with a good serving of fries came to a total of 12.00, which is on par with good fish and chips prices. 

I do wish the used a larger plate so that it was a tad easier to eat, but that did not detract from my meal. 

The decor looks like it's out of the 80's. Wood panelled walls, old lettering for the menus; it felt like a real mom and pop place. 

The staff are incredibly nice, as well. I will definitely return here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"hands down the best onion rings inna ghetto. 

the fish'n cheeps is good and the owner is awesome."}
