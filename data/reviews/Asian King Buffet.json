{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and not pleased with the food. The first time I ordered some fried rice, they just used steamed rice and mixed all the other ingredients in, it was sticky and had no taste. The second time I went, i ordered beef ho feng, it was well cooked but had no flavour. Their service is exceptional, dining area is empty, nothing fancy. Their prices are decent."}
{"text":"Horrible place to be ... pictures are deceiving
The food tastes  old especially the noodles. The inside of the restaurant is very low class and the attendants are useless as they barely speak English.i was very dissatisfied with my experience in this \"restaurant\".i will never return and I strongly suggest that you don't make the same mistake as me by visiting this place."}
{"text":"People are way too hard on this place. For a largely Caucasian neighbourhood, this place holds its own. It's not the best Asian food you will find but it definitely hits the spot. 

The owner is sweet and open to suggestions and any specific needs you might have. I've tried a few things from there and while it didn't knock my socks off - it was decent food that was filling with great portions. 

They have a good variety and they honestly do seem to try very hard from my experience. Try the Singapore noodles - albeit not authentic - ask them for extra spice! It really was good and I'm a big foodie. 

Overall 3/5 would be the most accurate rating I could give them - they excel in noodles while fried foods not so much. 

It is what it is!"}
{"text":"This is my second and probably last visit there since they are now open for all you can eat buffet from back when it use to be a take out place the staff has always  been very courteous and polite but this is pretty much it  my first visit was not so bad despite the low quantities of food for an all you can eat buffet food was just ok and with the discount coupon I guess I owe it another try but I was wrong today not only there is always not much choice available I found the honey garlic spare ribs to taste sour which went downhill from there the watermelon not fresh I mean I can understand not having the quantity of food available but when you compromise quality you lose me sorry r√©nald Oakville"}
{"text":"This is definitely a teen food place the food is cheaply priced and pretty good in my taste never had a problem the stuff is always so nice and welcoming also treat the younger crowd with the same respect as they would with the older crowd which is hard to find overall good food but i go for the service"}
{"text":"I've never really been stumped by trying to write a review ......I wanna say something nice here because the lady I think the owner is super nice ......
But i wamma help my fellow man /woman ....
Ummmmm............if your hungry and in this plaza 
Well walk across the parking lot to the bakery ..unless you have alot people to feed then just leave in general and find something else ...
Anyways ...trying to be nice ...ok ..the place is 70% clean I guess ....The staff is Nice but the food lacks flavor and needs a lot of improvement . It sucks because I love supporting family run buisness but sometimes if it's not run well then I just can't do it .
Good luck to all in this plaza ."}
{"text":"Don't know what everyone's issue is with Asian King, but we do takeout ALL the time and we've never had problems. Dined in their buffet, which was fairly minimal, but it was their launch week in the middle of winter. Yes, they have polishing in regards of service, but is not as bad as the others say."}
{"text":"oh my wooord... this is by far the most disgusting chain chinese restaurant i have ever set foot in!! i was starving and this seemed to be the only food option in the plaza except for a pizza place( wish i stayed there):( i had decided to order anyway against my first impression i took an order of dumplings,, so greasy and gross and some rice and szechuan beef again greasy and hard like a shoe!:(( never again"}
