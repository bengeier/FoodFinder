{"text":"Went in on a late Saturday afternoon. Ordered the spicy avocado & lime super grain mix bowl and my fiancé ordered the veggie burger \"west style side\" with regular fries and we both got a mix of of the delicious lemonades that they had prepared. The food was absolutely delicious !!!! The cashier was very helpful in describing all of the differences between items on the menu. The restaurant was clean and the same server was cleaning tables so it was maintained. They also sell beer and wine which was a plus. Overall a really great place to have lunch or dinner. ***Update*** The manager Coral and the cashier Maria helped us out  the second time we visited( the next day). We will definitely be visiting again"}
{"text":"My first time at b.good was today. I had my two kids with me so I called in a Togo order. We had to park in front of mellow mushroom and walk over to b.good (which was fine) but when we got there, the full bag of food didn't have any handles on it and my two drinks didn't come with any sort of drink carrier. I was holding my 1 year old in my arms and my 3 year old was walking beside me, I had limited ability to get these items so after I paid I asked if I could pull up in front of the store (there were no parking spots) and have them run the items out to me. Their response was \"um you can leave your car there and come inside\" so I said \"my kids will be in the car I can't leave them in there\" and the girl shrugged her shoulders. I went and got the car, pulled up, jumped out, ran in, got honked at, jumped back in my car and drove off.   At that point my kids are screaming for food and we have no straws, no napkins, and no cutlery. Ballantyne is full of families and mommies with young kids, and this place is not kid friendly. Let's hope the food works out (when we get home and find silverware, straws, and napkins)."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I had a small citrus and avocado salad and a kale crush smoothie.  Both were delicious.  My friend got the southwest chicken salad and it also looked amazing....I will try it next!"}
{"text":"My son and I gave it a try thinking it was Burger 21. We actually tried the grilled chicken sandwiches- don't order those! They were really dry and over-cooked. The buns were so burnt on one side that we had to scrape it with a knife. The sweet potato fries were 1/2 good, 1/2 inedible...couldn't even bite through them. Shoulda got a burger or salad, maybe that would have been better. Not coming back to try."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly greeted and received some menu suggestions from the cashier (order at counter and wait for your coaster to light type place) -- good sign to start, right?  2 regular burgers, some fries and a kids slider were ordered with their Kale Crush smoothie ~$36. After roughly 24 minutes and seeing people that came after us getting their food, decided to ask if our coaster was broken -- nope, waiting on smoothie. We got the food, while the burger had a nice char on it, the fries seemed slightly undercooked and meh.   Around the 35 minute mark, we're guessing the smoothie we were waiting on was forgotten, so went and asked, it was completed and sitting in their freezer.  As you can see, the kind service at the beginning was surprisingly deceptive. I'd call this a failure on their service on many levels. Nobody tried to figure out why food was getting cold or a smoothie was made and not picked up even after they knew we were still waiting on it. The burger was decent, if only the rest of their food and service were.  The concept was good and we were really hoping to like this place, but we'll never return, and from the staff's demeanor, I'm picking up they won't care."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to hear that b.good had a Charlotte location since I'm originally from the New England area and always enjoyed eating at b.good because of their farm to table concept when I lived there. Sad to say my experience at the b.good in ballantyne wasn't as good as I hoped and I don't think I'll be returning. First we ordered turkey burgers with fries and a drinks.   Positives....The burgers were good, fries were decent however not as good as I remember them to be and their rosemary lemonade was excellent just as I remember it.   Negatives....They served the burgers before they brought out the fries so we had to wait on the fries and by the time the fries came out the burgers were cold. Also the girl behind the counter who was preparing our food went back and forth from dining room to kitchen several times, was preparing food without any gloves, and to top it off she had a light blue band-aid on one finger of each hand. Having worked in food service in the past I know that anytime you change tasks in the kitchen it is best practice to wash your hands and put on new gloves. I didn't see her do any of the sort. I didn't see a sanitation rating posted but I'm assuming since they've only been open for about a week they haven't had a aviation from the health department yet. Needless to say I was highly disgusted and don't think I will be visiting this b.good location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had lunch with the family.  Love the cincept, but the restaurant has some kinks to work out.  When we arrived there were 2 orders ahead of us and all 3 tables waited at least 12 minutes to get food and orders came out 3-5 minutes in between. Almost seemed they could only handle one order at a time. Also, only found one napkin dispenser in the entire restaurant which caused a big bottleneck by the drinks and condiments.  Despite the operational issues to address, the food was great.  We had one grain and kale bowl, a salad, a kids chicken sandwich and a parmesean and veggie side.  All items got the thunbs up."}
{"text":"Omg!!! My new favorite place in Charlotte!!!! The food is so fresh always comes out on time!! The fresh juices are aaaaaamazing!!! I really do love this place. I can twice this week already and will be back tomorrow! Amazing staff and general manager to top it off!  This is the next BIG thing in Charlotte!! Fresh food and juices you'll never go wrong!!! You see them make your food and you can even see the fresh veggies through the window! You have to try it! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in because we could not get a seat next door. I'm glad we ended up at B.good. The cashier was informative and friendly. The food was prepared pretty quick. I had the spicy avocado with kale and quinoa bowl. It was very good but I was disappointed that there was not much avocado on it. My friend had a burger and fries and said it tasted fresh. Though I like that the portion is large it would be nice to have a half bowl option at a lesser price.   I don't live near by but would recommend it to others and will eat here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing to see all these 5 star reviews and the 2 times I have eating here it was a bad experience. Upon further examination, half the 5 star reviews have only posted once or twice!The first time was a take out order that was the complete wrong order. The second time I gave them the benefit of the doubt and dined in on a Friday night. There was one other couple in the whole place and it took 30 minutes to get 2 burgers. Food is decent, service is suspect and efficiency is non existent. Certainly not worth the price."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon waiting for a concert to start in the park across the street--really happy we did! Love the concept, the crew was super friendly, and the food was fantastic. My partner had the turkey burger and said it was so good it didn't even need condiments, and my spicy avocado lime bowl was beyond delicious (and huge!). Had a cherry-peach smoothie for dessert and it was awesome-just the flavor of real fruit and not too sweet. We'll be back next time we come through Charlotte!"}
{"text":"When I came in today to redeem my free kale and grain bowl, I was enthusiastically greeted by the staff members. I love a warm welcoming  friendly atmosphere! I also love great healthy and tasty food! I chose the spicy avocado lime bowl and it was delicious. Very filling and very fresh. I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"For my first visit and thus far each time I have visited, I found the staff very knowledgeable and friendly.  It has encouraged me to want to come back and also tell others of my visit.  Love the food as well, must try something new on each visit.  But right now I am stuck on the smoothies, eggplant meatballs and sweet potato fries!!"}
{"text":"WOW. I catered a company lunch with B.Good today, and cannot speak highly enough of the entire experience. The customer service that I received (especially from Sean and Karen F.) was stellar, the presentation of the food was beautiful, and the quality and taste was absolutely excellent. From meticulously caring for specific allergy restrictions to bringing along attractive food labels to describe each dish to guests, they did a great job. Coming from someone who has worked in the food industry and now frequently coordinates the catering for company meals, B.Good is definitely on a higher level of quality than most. I also love that they make good quality, healthy food look and taste so delicious.  We ordered the burger and chicken sliders, which were accompanied with smashed avocado, BBQ sauce, sauteed mushrooms and other typical condiments. The whole wheat buns were fresh, the meat cooked very nicely, and the size quite large for sliders. The kale power salad was also totally delicious. Great job all around! I look forward to dropping by the store for lunch some time soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food, healthy/local produce!  Amazing smoothies!"}
{"text":"Extremely pricey to get full.  But they're givers and it's healthy food for sure.  First visit is free.  That's special.  They gave me fries too"}
{"text":"I had a salad with berries and bad dressing and it took them 20 minutes to make it. Several people who ordered after me including my lunch companion got their food way before me. And I didn't have any meat on mine so I'm not sure what took so long. I eventually asked for it and it was brought out. I was very excited initially when this place opened but overall I am incredibly unimpressed. The only good thing was the drink options. They had real cane soda and other good options. But i don't go to restaurants for the sodas. I won't go back. Too many great options in ballantyne."}
{"text":"Great experience overall. The sweet potato fries is delicious, hand cut, oven roasted and very sweet. He southwest chicken salad is good too but a bit heavy on the dressing. I would order it again but definitely ask for less dressing. I would love to come back here soon and try the crisp veggie and Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"Place is not consistent. Service is very slow and that should be no excuse because it's not packed when I'm there. I've been 3 times and I think today was the last one."}
{"text":"Excellent food! If you want to eat healthy, this may be the best spot in Charlotte.  Incredible value!  Try their spicy avocado and lime bowl--it rocks!"}
{"text":"First experience disaster. Ordered the food online to go, to take on the road. We arrived and waited another 30 minutes before it was ready. The staff seemed completely clueless-they weren't even sure if it had been paid for. Food was cold. Chicken was dry. Sweet potato fries were not done. Ordered a kids meal for my daughter, and there were maybe three pieces of broccoli as a side. Not only did we get delayed leaving town, but the food was not good at all. Once we got situated in the car, and halfway down the road, they had forgotten our drinks :-("}
{"text":"After too many months apart, finally was reunited today with the Spicy Avocado & Lime Kale & Quinoa Bowl, and the best Butternut Soup ever. The new Uptown Charlotte location has stunning interiors. The staff was professional, pleasant. And our cashier was fully versed on menu details -- he gave a glowing endorsement of the Adopted Luke burger -- and made it easy for us to complete an app BOGO redemption."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We ordered 3 kids meals for our children, a veggie burger & salad. The kids meals came out with ice chips on them & the hotdogs were cold. The \"steamed\" broccoli was cold as well. The veggie burger wasn't cooked at all and the bun was frozen. The salad was just plain gross. When we realized how bad everything was, we politely asked for the kids meals to be warmed up and for the veggie burger to be grilled. The 2 cooks were not pleased and made that clear. Once they warmed the meals, they were edible but honestly, not very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The employees were polite and pretty nice. But... the place was filthy. A lot of tables were dirty. No one cleaned the tables in the place during the hour I was there sitting. Most important, the food, a burger, tasted spoiled. ... no joke. And I'm not picky about food. It tastes like the beef and the mushrooms were rotten. I left most of it. Disappointing. I gave it two stars basically because no one said anything rude, ... or punched me in the face, ... so that was good."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I am a repeat customer at Be Good and I can't get enough. Try their bowls and smoothies. Amazing customer service and great promotions. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Variety of healthy and fresh options for a quick, nutritious and delicious lunch - a highly recommended add to the lunch rotations of anyone working uptown!"}
{"text":"Really like this place BUT pretty sure it will be out of business in 12-24 months. Not because of food quality but foot traffic is very poor. Each time we have been, there is hardly anyone there. Went there to grab a salad for dinner (take-out) and it was like they were closed; so dead inside. Agree that it's a little pricey but the salads are good!"}
{"text":"Loved how fast and fresh this was! The power bowl had great flavor and kept me full all afternoon. The smoothie (acai) was refreshing and light. I was surprised how well all the flavors came together! Only issue was every time I tried to call to set an order, the line was busy but just drove over and it only took 3-4 min to get my food!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Place is well organized. Wait is not long at all even though it looks like it might be. The only issue we had was that it was very loud and hard to hear. People taking orders have hard time hearing the customers and you might get a wrong order. Staff is very nice and polite. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I was eager to try this restaurant when I saw it would be opening.  Unfortunately, after trying it tonight, I have to report that it was simply not that good.  I ordered a spicy avocado and lime bowl, which costs $13 if chicken is added.  The avocado, though prominently featured first in the name of the menu item, was small--about 1/4 of an avocado.  What's worse, significant portions of it were brown/black, not fresh or green at all. So after cutting out the dark parts, there was hardly any avocado left.  Besides the avocado, the bowl itself was surprisingly small with very sparse amounts of each of the ingredients.  The contents are placed in a large flat bowl (to make it look large, I suppose), but it had very little depth.  Both my date (who also ordered a bowl) and I left hungry.  When 2 people pay $30 for a simple fast casual meal and leave hungry, it is not acceptable.  Perhaps that would have been more palatable if the food were excellent, but the flavor was not to my liking.  Compared to somewhere like Chopt, Yafo, or even Freshii (all of which would have been less money for more food), it was sadly lacking.    I guess it should have been a clue when we walked in at 7pm on a Saturday and the place was completely empty.  The servers were nice, but that doesn't salvage the unappealing food.  Not to mention the long community tables were very uncomfortable, and the cloth cushions were stained and looked filthy.  I really wanted to like this place, but it was definitely a fail."}
{"text":"Ahh finally something like this in Ballantyne! This place is so delicious, I swear we've come 4 times in the past week (and I'm not kidding, just ask the staff).   I think it goes without saying that the Spicy Avocado & Lime bowl is the bomb diggity (and crazy filling), but everything else we've tried thus far has been delicious too (see: sandwiches made West Side style with sweet potato fries) - NOMS.   We keep coming after the gym on weeknights but would also make a great lunch spot.   I also just downloaded the app - helloooo rewards. 5 stars! I know they opened another location on Rea Rd too which is awesome."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on May 4th. I thought that the food was good and good friendly service. However, I give B. Good 2 stars as there was an issue with the order and they refunded the order apparently but it is now May 20th and no refund in the bank after numerous phone calls to the manager."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Every time I have been it has been SO good. I'm so happy to have this as a new lunch option uptown. Hope you guys set up shop in South Park eventually as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today because I saw their happy hour (2-5pm mon-fri) half price smoothies sign in the window. This was my first experience here. I Ordered their kale smoothie.  My friend ordered the mixed greens smoothie, and my mother got the strawberry banana one. I love that they have all their fresh ingredients displayed!  Our smoothies tasted great and were made from real ingredients (not juice)which I appreciated. The fact that they were less than $3.50 a piece was even better.   We were there during a down time (Wednesday around 3pm) so the restaurant was Empty. I noticed it was extremely clean and the staff was friendly.  They have outdoor seating but no awning that would block the sun. Looks like it's under construction.  Cant wait to go back and try their food"}
{"text":"There were only a handful of people inside but yet I took them 40 min to do a burger and a salad. The chef was not in a hurry and just chatting with someone."}
{"text":"The staff is the friendliest, most welcoming, and genuinely engaging. I love the whole feel of the decor and the GREAT menu variety!!  The spicy avocado & lime bowl is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Frozen vegan burger? Bland, tasteless. Come on guys improve on this if you want my business. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Very slow and indifferent service; didn't get what I ordered on numerous occasions. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Great REAL food. Love the concept and flavors. The baked fries are terrific, burgers are awesome and juices are unique and delicious. Service is good. Not outrageously priced but REAL food is more expensive wherever you can find it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Owner/manager that's often there is always extremely friendly and helpful, as is the staff.   Food is consistent.   It's nice to have a place with hearty, healthy options in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Well they have a 90 for their sanitation score. I don't think I've been to a gas station McDonald's with a rating that low.   I had read the reviews and had no intention of coming here, but my mom wanted to try it. So I got a side size chicken ceaser salad, my mom had a side size southwest salad and my dad had a burger.  The place was basically empty at 6:30 on a Wednesday, our food came out quickly. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 cause the salads weren't bad, but they were very forgettable an unremarkable. Not something I'd ever go back for. My dads burger was very small, bland and dull.  I give this place 6 months."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! I wasn't sure what to order and the staff was helpful!! I had the Zucchini spaghetti and eggplant meatballs, yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Check out my burger delivered today. I didn't even have to tell them I was a vampire! So raw, yet so burnt on the edges. I screams of safety."}
{"text":"Solid spot for quick (relatively), healthy and local sourced food. Not gonna be fast food rates but you get a decent Amon too food for your $."}
{"text":"Great way to satisfy my burger craving with more healthy choices.  My burger selection was delicious and I had a kale smoothie as my side veggie option, which was also very tasty. There are many healthy yet great tasting choices here and that is very welcoming to me. I must say that the fact that they also have a few (3, I think) wine selections makes it more enticing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food!  We really loved the food, my burger cousin Oliver and fries was just the right size.  I am not a pickle fan and usually ask for them to be removed.  The pickles that came on my burger were fantastic, crisp and delicious. I would have liked the fries to be crispier though I like the concept of making them in the oven.  My wife had a quinoa bowl and enjoyed it.  The kids had a burger and he chicken sandwich.  The kids meal had a good amount of food.  Both kids liked there food and were stuffed without finishing.    We arrived around 11:30 and there was one order ahead of us.  The food took longer than we expected.  Maybe that is because it is made fresh?   My burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was not soggy so they got it right.  We liked the drink selection and seating.  No major concerns.  BGood is a great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fast and healthy are hard to find together - but this place delivers food that's local, fresh, delicious, and quick. I love their bowls - the spicy avocado lime bowl with chicken is great. The staff is friendly, remembered me, and is always able to answer any questions I have. Consistent quality and great food has made this place one of my go-to's."}
{"text":"If you like healthy food and a vegan snd into organic food. This is the place for you.Try the power bowl.. its delicious, simple, and of course healthy. The staff is friendly and service quick. Wish there were more around nationwide."}
{"text":"To B or Not To B.Good  That is the question and the answer is  HECK YES B.Good is GOOD If I would've reviewed on my first visit I would've provided 5+++ as it was awesome from start to finish. Recently completed my 6th visit ( I typically review immediately or after my 3rd visit if the place is located somewhere I can easily access)  Visit #1 Welcomed with a smile, order promptly taken, food presentation and freshness was undeniable as well as the flavor. I had the Spicy Kale Superfood bowl with a green smoothie. It was so Fresh and full of flavor each veggie was crisp. Visit #2 Semi Welcomed, order taken semi prompt, food presented good. I got the same items from visit #1 with some additions for our son and my husband who came for their first visit. The order came out incorrect twice, however they were prompt in correcting the mistakes.  Visit #3 Not welcomed, food took EXTREMELY LONG & when I went to inquire they lost my ticket and had to start my order at that time (20mins after I re approached) Visits 4-6 Ordered to go and got items from visit #1 which was made correct however two of those visits it took extremely long and the place wasn't busy. I really enjoy the two items o frequently order but think I'll give them some time to work out the kinks in their process before frequenting.   Let's not forget that kitchen is open so you can watch your food being prepared and the fresh veggies are displayed in a glass wall on one side of the seating area where you can see all the yummy fresh veggies. They also have ROOTS brand soda on tap which is cool. And a number of fresh lemonades to choose from."}
{"text":"I had the spicy avocado & lime salad which could actually feed three of me! The portion was hefty, especially the quinoa & kale. It tasted lovely & lively - the lime really made the dish tasty. The chipotle  purée and the red pepper vinaigrette gave it the spicy zing! I would've enjoyed it more if they had added more avocado since there were only a few slices in proportion to the other ingredients. It was as fresh as they claimed it would be so I was satisfied. I also ordered the sweet potato fries on the side and unfortunately, it was soggy and way too salty for my buds. Their fresh juices, flavored lemonades and teas were delicious! I would've given them a 3.5 stars if only those sweet potato fries came out crispy and less salty. I'll try their other bowls next time I'm back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good Caesar salad with chicken! We enjoyed takeout and the friendly service. They have lots of healthy options--be sure to download the app to have freebies. We had a free side for downloading and the first visit. We chose Brussels sprouts & they were tasty with almonds, balsamic and cheese. They needed a little more browning but good overall. I'm intrigued by their smoothies menu so will be returning."}
{"text":"Have only had one experience from the Ballantyne location but the Turkey Burger was amazing, and the crisp vegetable kale salad was clean and tasty! Will definitely try more of their food!"}
{"text":"Love the quality and selection! Fresh and tasty! The bowls are huge - wish you could prefer half sizes."}
{"text":"His place has yummy, healthy, fast meal options!! Also, I love the outdoor seating. The workers always come by our table numerous times to ask if we need anything."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. And I wanted the food to \"be good\".   See what I did there?   And this place just didn't do it for me. I was greeted immediately and after a quick review of the menu I decided to grab a kids meal. It comes with your choice of burger (beef, turkey, chicken), fries (regular or sweet potato), broccoli, apple sauce and a drink.   I decided to go with the turkey burger. I checked out the place while I waited and grabbed my condiments. I did like that they had a plethora of drinks and lemonade and teas. I tried the strawberry lemonade. For me, it was just ok. Not my favorite.   I found a table with no problem since the place was pretty empty. Then I waited. And waited. And waited. At one point I checked my buzzer to make sure everything was working ok.   15 minutes later.   My buzzer finally goes off I go to get my meal and sit down and it's cold. What the hell is going on?! What had I been waiting on? The broccoli was cold. The fries were cold and the burger was warm at best with a cold bun.   But I was hungry, so I just started to eat. And I was so underwhelmed. I didn't eat the fries or bun. And picked over the broccoli and burger.   Ugh.   I'm not impressed and don't plan to hear back here any time soon."}
{"text":"First time at B good, and I love the interior. We walked in to order and were greeted pretty quickly, though I can see how workers may miss you if they are on the other side of the restaurant where they make the food. The setup reminds me of many of the trendy hot spots out west. I decided to try the harvest kale salad with tofu. I love all the add in options - garbanzo beans, brussel sprouts, manchego cheese, sunflowers and acorn squash. I was disappointed in the tofu though - it was barely seasoned and very bland, which almost ruined the salad for me. I think it would be a much more attractable option if they baked or charred the tofu to make it a little less chewy and watery, and add more flavor. My husband went with the spicy avocado and lime salad, which we both enjoyed, though seemed a little light. I love the menu and I think they have great potential. They even offer burgers, fries and some alcohol. I love the ingredients they use and their commitment to healthy foods that taste good. I'll have to try some different options next time."}
{"text":"Awesome place! It's nice to have a healthy and convenient option for lunch. Definitely get the app and order ahead!! I've had their turkey burgers and grain bowls, I recommend both! Also, get the elote!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see something going into the old Boneheads location. I live close to stonecrest and was excited to see that they put in another fast casual option convenient to me. The website made the place look interesting so we decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and I were very disappointed and will not be coming back. He said it was a 1, I'll give it a 2.  The biggest problem is that the cooking area doesn't connect to the cash register area and there is not someone standing in the front at the registers to greet you or help with ordering. We waited ten minutes until someone noticed us standing there and came to take our orders. This could be just a mishap, but then we watched the same thing happen to every customer that came in after us. It is definitely not good customer experience to operate like this.   The prices are higher than expected but the ingredients are locally sourced. Unfortunately, the taste of the food did not measure up to the prices even if the ingredients were local. The fries are terrible. They are supposed to be a healthier option with less calories and fat but that is what makes fries taste good. These taste like ore ida fries from the frozen food section. They were very mushy and tasted super bland. The salad was not bad but honestly Panera has much better salads. It just wasn't anything special, especially for $13 after adding chicken. My boyfriend got the turkey burger which was edible but nothing great. Average maybe. The portion sizes left me hungry upon leaving.  The menu has very limited options. Healthy can taste good but unfortunately healthy did not taste good here. The place was virtually empty and it's only been open two weeks. Honestly, not sure what happened to Boneheads but I never saw that place this empty once.   I will not be back here which stinks because it is such a convenient location. I will make the drive down to chopt to get my healthy but yummy fix."}
{"text":"Delicious, delightful and fresh.....a bowl brimming with salad and a burger with proud beef and toppings I chose  braised on top....the smoothies and Maine root handcrafted beverages ....there's nothing to dislike here! Staff was friendly and helpful with recommendations and explanations of their dishes.the setting was bright and open with different seating choices. I definitely want to visit again...and soon!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!! Soooo fresh, healthy, & delicious! The staff is super nice & food made quick! The rush lunch hour gets pretty crazy, but you can order ahead on the app! The southwest chicken salad is amazing!! Cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"In my head I wanted to just yell at the person who placed my order as I was nearly greeting hangry in the eyes, but then I realized I made the mistake of not fully reading the menu. I ordered the Kale smoothie and specified I can not have pineapple juice what I should have requested was a substitute for the pineapple juice. I also asked for a side of veggies only if the veggies were fresh NOT frozen and I needed to stress I WANTED them RAW! The person behind the registered gave me a side eye yet still politely put in my request. I turned to my son to ask if I had made myself clear as to how I wanted my food cause another side eye was given yet still the young lady maintained herself and kindly asked if I would like anything else. Long story short, my smoothie was about to be made with pineapple juice BUT the manager did NOT hesitate to intercept the order and immediately came to my rescue by offering/suggesting almond milk as a substitute for the pineapple juice. Not only did the manager complete my order but took time to engage in a brief conversation assuring my smoothie was made to my satisfaction. I wish I could recall their names because they went above and beyond not only to show their quality in service but also to help satisfy my hangry. Oh and yes my side of veggies were tasty."}
{"text":"Food is good, long wait (30 min from order to table) overly loud, not enough trash can spots like in Chopt- preferred salad spot) seriously over priced for the amount of food. Always happy to support local but not when the value isn't there."}
{"text":"First time visiting B. Good the other day on the recommendation from several coworkers. Drove from 20 mins away and it was definitely worth it! I opted for the Turkey burger and real fries. I do plan on visiting again soon! The food, service, and ambiance were all premium and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Thanks B good!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm definitely a fan of fresh food. And moved from Boston, I'm always a fan of Bgood. However the customer service in this location doesn't exist. Order came out wrong, and your question couldn't get properly answered. I hope whoever is the manager could pick this up and respect the brand and good food little better."}
{"text":"If you haven't gone, you must try! Great place to take kids for a healthier burger and fries. The environment is so cool! Casual but nice. The sweet potato fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"The eggplant meatballs are to die for. The sauce is so yummy I wanted to lick my bowl. I love the chicken Caesar as well. Love the dressing!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it's was amazing. I'm allergic to gluten and while looking at multiple menus Sean came outside and greeted us and talked about the food. It's hard to find a place my boyfriend and I can both eat at due to my allergy. He was able to get a burger and I was able to get a bowl with quinoa. There chicken is actually real chicken. They were doing free sides and the grilled corn is a must. Sean even excluded the oil because of my allergy. He came buy and even explained the process that he took to make sure I was taken care of. Such passionate and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Decent but fairly expensive.  Veggie burger fell apart completely off the bun. Food was pretty good. Being vegan, I did appreciate their options. My daughter has celiac and they did have good gluten free options. She enjoyed her chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries.  The fries are hand cut and hot when served. Would probably go back, but cost is a factor.  The meal as shown, with no add ons or drink was over $12"}
{"text":"Great burgers and healthy options. I would recommend ordering on the app or online to slip the line because it gets pretty long. I loved the SalBacado burger."}
{"text":"The food is quite good. However what really sets the place apart is two things: customer service and ingredient quality. You can talk to the kitchen staff while they make your food. They even know if sauces used on the food are gluten free or not."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with B Good.  I visited on 2 different occasions for takeout, but my order was pretty much the same, turkey burger and sweet potato fries.  I wanted a combination of the Cousin Oliver and the Adopted Luke, the turkey burger was hand packed with sautéed mushrooms, onions, lettuce, tomato, etc.  The burger is perfectly seasoned with all fresh toppings, a great bun, and made to order.....delish.  The sweet potato fries are baked and on my first visit were half burned so I would advise the staff to pay more attention to that with takeout orders.  Overall, the turkey burger was one of the best I've ever had, and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Organic food. Lots healthy choices . Turkey burgers to kale and quinoa and everything in between... it was very tasty, but Be prepared to pay for that farm fresh food!   We ordered Burger, fries and salad with side of Brussel sprouts.   It was good food. All of it was delicious ! The menu is updated regularly with fresh dishes as food is in season.  Don't miss this place ! It's definitely good !"}
{"text":"Fresh food I waited a while but worth the wait so who cares I'm just happy you guys substitute with almond milk! You're the best!!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The employees, atmosphere and food were amazing! I wasn't sure what I was going to try for my first visit so I asked the woman behind the counter. Instead of shrugging off my question, she gave me the top 3 selections and her personal favorite! I went with a salad for my first trip but have already been back for her recommendation, the turkey burger! She even gave me a free cup to sample the lemonades and..... I'm hooked! I've even been back for just the basil lemonade!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop at this joint and get my baby some food for dinner. I think all the food they give for 5.99 is great. The kids meal comes with a decent entree selection, broccoli, apple sauce, drink, and regular  or sweet potato fries.  I got my kid the turkey burger and a kale smoothie. That's the trick to get your kid to eat veggies parents... smoothies. We got that first so i gave it to her first.   For $2 extra I was like what the fudge is this. They give you so little for a smoothie but then again it's not that bad.  However the turkey burger was extremely dry, like no juiciness at all. My daughter didn't eat it. I ate it because I was mad hungry. The fries were good and she didn't touch the broccoli but hey she already got kale and spinach from her smoothie so mission accomplished.  I may come back to see what's up with their other dishes... for adults."}
{"text":"B Good- nice restaurant. Staff is extremely friendly. You must try the lemonade. Jesus, it's so good. You must visit. It is in a nice area"}
{"text":"We tried this recently for lunch. It was obscenely crowded and they actually lost my order so it was over 30 minutes to get my food while all my friends finished their meals. The food was good though. It's like healthier versions of burgers and fries.   I think part of the chaos is caused by online orders mixing in with other orders. Hopefully they will improve on that. Though if I went back I would order online."}
{"text":"Everything tastes really good. The smoothies,salads & flavored lemonade.   I only gave 3 stars because it took incredibly long, both times, to get our food. So my wife ordered online and it was ready, but the portions weren't the same."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place but never had the opportunity to do it. Today my husband and I were going to watch the Knights game and on the way we decided to stop by and finally try it.  It is summer and has been so HOT that I've been only craving healthy and light food. My husband decided to have El Guapo burger (bacon, homemade jalapeño slaw, jalapeño ranch) and I decided to go with the Açaí Berry Smoothie (açaí, blueberries, pineapple, banana, almond milk, chia and lemon. My husband loved his burger and my smoothie was pretty good! The staff is nice, the place was clean and organized and the prices were average for the kind of place it is. Even though they were busy our order got done fast. They have a very interesting menu with options for kids and different options for drinks. They also have Vegan and Gluten Free. I enjoyed my visit and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had an appointment over in Ballantyne but had a moment to get lunch. I went to B Good and wanted to get the spicy avocado chicken bowl with grains. I'm fairly indecisive when it comes to food sometimes but I knew I wanted that. I ordered but was told there weren't any grains until Wednesday. It was Monday. So I opted for the southwestern salad instead. It was good, fresh and I did like the freshly grilled chicken, corn nuts and dressings on the side. When I'm near there again, I'll try again. People around me seemed to enjoy the burgers and someone had ice cream."}
{"text":"The meals I've had here have been very delicious! It is super healthy, fresh, and tasty. I got the spicy avocado and lime bowl my first visit and loved it...I will say, it can get expensive if you add meat/ eggs. The smoothies have unique flavors that I have loved every time! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"b. good is the latest to hit the healthy food trend.  My chicken caesar salad was served in a very large bowl.  The salad covered the bottom only & looked pretty spartan in the large bowl.    The staff is friendly though too many at the counter & not enough cleaning up.  There were tables that could've stood some wiping.  The beverage choices are very limited as well.  W/lemonades, water, smoothies & a dispenser not much selection.   All in all it hit the spot for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food is good and ingredients are fresh, however the sauce is everywhere here. Too much sauce, it covers everything and the sauces for the most part are very spicy. The Mediterranean chicken salad isn't advertised as spicy and it was very spicy. Also the corn was no good and covered in sauce too. However, the service was exceptional! Would try again but ask that they put the sauce on the side so I can add it as I please-I'm personally not a fan of a drowning salad."}
{"text":"Came here because burger joint next door was too busy to eat in. Ordered veggie el gaupo add cheddar and regular beef burger Luke style. Waited 20 mins and orders were both wrong. Veggie burger had bacon on it,bun was rock hard and crumbled to pieces. Veggie burger was inedible. It wasn't even the correct toppings. Sweet potato fries were cold, limp, yet blackened ends. Beef burger was served el gaupo style instead of it being on the veggie burger. The veggie burger came with cabbage and bacon? No cheese. Even if the cashier put in the order wrong, it still didn't even resemble what was on the ticket.   Few people inside and two other people had to have their orders fixed as well.  My friend decided to try the veggie burger as is minus the bacon and they did not finish it.   They refired my beef burger and sweet potatoes fries. His time order was correct, however the burger tasted like lighter fluid and was extremely charred and smothered in almost a half a cup of bbq sauce. For $30 I would have expected more at least in terms of quality. We threw the food out and left.   The other patrons looked just as disappointed as us. The shining light was the ice tea was okay and they had a tasty beet juice lemonade.   Will not return. It should have been a warning this place was completely empty on a Saturday evening when all the surrounding establishments had lines out the door almost."}
{"text":"The food is somewhere between ok and good, so I rounded up to 4 stars due to the friendly service at the register.  I had the spicy avocado and lime kale and grain bowl.  As with other raw kale dishes, chewing the kale was a tiring experience.  There was a lot of it and it is not the easiest thing to chew.  I guess I wasn't expecting it to be salad-like, but it had good flavor.  I also sampled the strawberry banana smoothie, which tasted as expected.  Tried the baked french fries as well.  Eh, I guess this is why people don't bake them.  Overall it is a perfectly fine lunch stop."}
{"text":"My husband and I were disappointed in our visit last night. From the food to the service, there left a lot to be desired.  We went at 7:30 and there was hardly anyone else there. We took our time trying to decide what to order. When we finally approached the counter to order, the cashier seemed very flustered. Half way though ordering she picked up the ringing phone and tried to have 2 conversations going at once while we told her the rest of our order. She kept getting it wrong because she was obviously distracted by the person on the phone.   Despite no one else ordering before us, it took us about 15-20 minutes to get our food and mine came out a good 5 minutes before my husbands followed by another 5 minutes for our sides. Overall the good concept seemed right up our alley, but sadly was lacking in flavor and size. For $28 we both left hungry and unsatisfied. I had the massaged kale salad with chicken and my husband had the western burger with sweet potato fries. We definitely won't be back unless we hear some serious changes were made. This is quite side because I have heard such good things about the chain from other locations, but it's not worth the drive or our money right now."}
{"text":"The reason why I gave it 2 stars was due to their customer service and length of time it took to get my food. I ordered a spicy avocado and kale bowl. I sat down and seen multiple people come in after me and get their food which is always frustrating but it happens. At 25 minutes, I approached the counter to ask about my order and this woman told me that it would be out in a minute or two. Fifteen minutes later I approached again and was ready to give it to someone. As I approached they had what ended up being my food sitting at the counter for me to pickup. The woman behind the counter didn't know who's item it was and couldn't call out a number. Mind you, they have a little device that they give you when you order that is supposed to go off/buzz when your order is ready. Well either they didn't press the button to activate mine or it's faulty. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it might be faulty. But after waiting 40 minutes to get my food, which contained no meat(a reason why it shouldn't take as long), I received no apology but what I received was \"you waited 40min for a bowl?!\". This was the same woman that I approached 15 minutes before, she clearly did not remember. I took my bowl and went back to my table with no apology at all. The food was actually good too which is why I gave them the 2 stars. But it just didn't taste as good as it probably was after being so infuriated after that experience."}
{"text":"If I am looking for something healthy, b.good is my go-to place nearby. Their grain bowls are so tasty! Finding healthy, non-salad, options is a little difficult around this area of Charlotte so I was glad when b-good opened nearby. The prices are fair for the quality and the portions."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Kind of pricey for what you get.  Massively understaffed by what appeared to be 2 high school girls.  Literally had no napkins for the entire meal because of lack of staffing.  One girl was chef and other had to  take orders.  Fries are bland and actually somewhat raw.  I ate two bc the calories were not worth it for a raw potato.  Similar to napkins, we had to ask for ketchup.  Thankfully she was able to stock that after 5 minutes."}
{"text":"b.good is a refreshing new concept among a continually evolving south Charlotte restaurant scene. It is, in fact, the only farm-to-table offering in the franchise-heavy area in which it resides.   Burgers and salads look appealing but I have stuck with the Kale and Grain Bowls on both of my trips. The power bowl, laden with brussels sprouts and crunchy chickpeas, was exceptional.  Service and was just okay and sanitation was acceptable. Will be back for a burger."}
{"text":"b.good is a refreshing new concept among a continually evolving south Charlotte restaurant scene. It is, in fact, the only farm-to-table offering in the franchise-heavy area in which it resides. I do like this location a bit better than it's sister restaurant in Stonecrest one exit down off 485. The dining area is much brighter and roomier.  I have  gone with the Kale and Grain Bowls on two of my three trips. The power bowl, laden with brussels sprouts and crunchy chickpeas, was tasty and filling. The veggie burger is beautfully presented and  flavorful. Still, though nothing has really blown me away.   Service and was okay and sanitation was barely acceptable at a grade of 93. Unfortunately for them, there are just too many excellent restaurants in the area for just barely acceptable sanitation grades. Hopefully both locations will improve upon that going forward. Otherwise, a GoPlaySave Buy1 Get1 Free coupon will guarantee that I'll at least return for one more visit."}
{"text":"Good food especially the burgers. They have beef, turkey and vegan burgers that can be order without buns and subbed with veggies. Also love the eggplant meatballs but they come just 3 to an order with nothing else. Just meatballs in sauce with a little mozzarella on top. Not a full meal.   Don't come here thinking it's fast food. It's fresh food so it will take a little longer. We used the online ordering and came in and picked up quickly."}
{"text":"B. Good is a great addition to my weekly lunch cycle! It's the definition of fast casual - quick service, cute and cozy, and there are even tables outside to eat when it's nice out. I love that everything is so fresh - even the ketchup and soda are more natural, better for you brands. I love the turkey burger and sweet potato fries - so yummy and filling! They have mastered the crispest sweet potato fries. And definitely try the Maine Root soda because it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was less than great..  I had high hopes for this place given the prices and healthy options, but I don't know that I'd return unfortunately!"}
{"text":"I love the food at b.good but especially the roasted brussel sprouts! I love brussel sprouts and have tried many at numerous restaurants, dome high end restaurants, and these are hands down the best I've ever had! But not only that, everyone there from the girls that take your order to the cooks to the manager are EXTREMELY friendly and helpful and so polite! I've never had a bad experience there, other than some pretty long waits for my side of brussel sprouts to go, and they are always so pleasant and kind. They learned my name by about my second or third visit, ALL of them, and their customer service is exceptional! In addition I will say that the customer loyalty program is a big incentive to keep going there and the company is very generous and does a good job of keeping up with your visits and rewarding you! I love b.good and in particular mine at Stonecrest"}
{"text":"B.good is hands down my favorite lunch place. The food is amazing. It pains me to leave this review. I recently moved to the area from Raleigh so I've only been frequenting this location for a couple months now. The customer service at this location is HORRIBLE and the wait is very long. If you're crunched for time on your lunch break, then skip this place. Today I had been waiting for over 30 minutes so I decided to go up and ask about my meal. When I did, they realized it had been sitting on a shelf in the back and they had never buzzed me or called my name. When they realized the mistake they simply laughed and handed me my bag. No apology or even a simple \"sorry.\" This is unfortunately not the first time I've had a bad customer service experience here. I'm going to start driving a little out of the way for me to try the ballantyne location. Hopefully I have a different experience there!"}
{"text":"B. Good has fresh food and the most friendly staff. The women there today were so kind and helpful. I had the veggie burger and it was delicious. The eggplant meatballs are very yummy. Their kid's meals are also wholesome and it always feels good to feed the kids good food. Kids eat free on Tuesday and Thursday with adult entree so we will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this new spot out. As soon as i walked through the front door here was an overt UNWELCOMING feeling from the unfriendly staff. They seemed to almost hate their job. I mean every single person was unhappy and rude. The one smoothie i ordered took 15 minutes to make. I watched the guy make his own smoothie first and then make mine (he worked there!). This was a terrible experience and not worth $5 or my time. I advise firing all the staff or maybe new management."}
{"text":"In continuing my quest for healthy, wholesome eateries within the Charlotte area lead me to this location for lunch, and it was an overall delight. B. Good prides itself on serving locally grown and procured fresh, live foods to the delight of its customers.   I partook in their acai berries smoothie, compromised of acai berries, blueberries, pineapple, banana, almond milk, chia, and lemon, which was mouth-wateringly superb. Service was surprisingly quick, even though being in the midst of the busy lunch rush in the ballentine village retail area. The staff was very attentive and provided a free smoothie card for feedback on my visit. A charming, well maintained spot worthy of repeat visits for those seeking the healthy alternatives."}
{"text":"The avocado chili lime bowl is absolutely amazing. Fresh incredible flavors and very healthy to boot."}
{"text":"Amazing smoothies!! Been wanting to try this place for a while but finally had the chance today and so glad we did! Really hit the spot for a healthy alternative to a sugary smoothie! Will definitely be back. Just wish they had a few more flavors."}
{"text":"No prices on the menu. When I got up to the register- I assumed that the sandwich came with a side. It does not. I also assumed there was no charge for veggies instead of the bun. There is a charge. All things that the lady at the register could have told me before hand. Anyways my order: Turkey Burger - West Side style ($7.49) with veggies instead of bun. (substitution cost $2.99) and Harvest Kale Salad as my side ($5.99). After tax, my lunch cost me $17.66 and I didn't even get a drink! This place is outrageously expensive! The food was good, but its not almost $18 good."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant for healthy and fresh food! I love the vegan veggie burgers with gluten free buns and the kale quinoa and lime bowl! My daughter asks to go here so often. This is now one of our most favourite eateries in Charlotte... Such good food we crave!!  Thank you b.good!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE their salads & got my husband to eat eggplant which he said there was \"no use for on this earth\". Until I made him try that tasty non-pasta (well, veggie pasta) dish with veggie (eggplant) meatballs. Now he's hooked. It's really about how a food is prepared. B.Good sure got it straight!!!"}
{"text":"I first had the eggplant meatballs on a Friday during Lent. Will continue to get them all the time now. Delish!"}
{"text":"This is def a fast favorite!  And they are consistent.  My biggest concern is that working so close may definitely have me broke by the end of the summer! I love that most of the food is locally sourced (look at me, doing my part to support local agriculture!)  Its also pretty darn tasty! For a long time I would only get the spicy avocado bowl because it was so freaking good, but this week I have ventured out and tried the zucchini spaghetti with eggplant 'meatless' balls....and they knocked my socks off....SO GOOD!  I did something a little outrageous to this veg friendly dish and added BACON!  Yup i did it and it was soooooo tasty!  But bacon makes most things that much better right... Even so, the dish stood pretty well on its own. The avocado toast is pretty good too. I love that B.Good has a fountain of all natural sodas, that my kids love.   If you are looking for a healthy fast food option this is definitely the way to go.   Next i think I will try the smoothies because they look pretty tasty too, with a variety of blends.  Great addition to my dine out roster!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the bacon and apple kale salad but it came without the bacon. When we asked the waitress she told us they had run out of bacon but they could grill up some different bacon on the grill. We waited for over 30 min and finished our food but the bacon still hadn't come out, which means they probably forgot about us. We were going to give them another chance and ask the cashier who said she would handle this but there was a line by then and we decided to just count it as a wash and leave.   I'm pretty disappointed it was such a bad experience because I wanted to find a good salad bar and my boyfriend was already skeptical. I don't think I will ever be able to convince him to go to a similar place again.   The salads taste wise were fine, I got their seasonal summer berry salad and was reasonably full even though it was a pretty small serving. I added chicken to mine for an extra few dollars so it came out to be $12. I also got their banana peanut smoothie which was $6! My boyfriend's salad was another $10 so the bill was $30 which is pretty high for two salads and a smoothie, all of which I could make at home for under $15. I get they want fresh, locally sourced ingredients but really?   Parking is free and easy, there is a deck that services the entire shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time this week and was highly impressed. I went with my husband and mother in law and both were crazy for the food. I got the zucchini spaghetti eggplant meatballs and they were heaven, they were so good I am returning tomorrow to get it again. Also their beer ginger lemonade was to die for, I would return for simply the drink. The employees were extremely nice and were recommending great meals and had us try the drinks and it was just overall amazing."}
{"text":"Food was amazing food- very fresh - and service was quick and friendly. We did dine late at night - about 8:00 pm.  I will have to admit that I normally don't eat \"healthy\" options however I was pleasantly surprised after eating here.  The food was delicious. I had all intentions of ordering the all natural hamburger & fresh cut fries however, one of the employees recommended the eggplant meatballs and I reluctantly ordered them.  They were amazing and now my new favorite.   I also ventured out to try the zucchini spaghetti - I will have to admit that it wasn't bad.  I definitely think the sauce made it taste good - still zucchini.. but very tasty. I particularly like how they get their food from local farms and vendors.  Another pleasant surprise were the drinks offered there such as minty lemonade and another one was made with beet juice (which I loved).   Awesome, friendly service.  They won me over and I am a tough one to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Just not consistent! I'll come in one day & my food is delicious, warm & cooked perfectly. But then I'll come in another day & order the same exact thing & its just awful.  The only thing I can count on here is the Rosemary Lemonade."}
{"text":"Pro tip: Download the app and order from it to skip the (long) line. My friend and I did this for lunch on a Tuesday, and it saved us a ton of time. We ordered as we were walking there from the Duke Energy Center, and it was ready about 5 minutes after we arrived.  I got the Harvest Kale Salad ($8.49) with a bottle of water ($1.99). I should've just stuck with the water from their drink fountain, but I got a little confused with the app. Also, all their drinks seemed to be Maine Root, so no sodas here. The salad was bigger than I'd planned on, and I ate the whole thing. Nom nom nom. I love healthy food, but I'm still amazed at how tasty it was AND only 309 calories according to their website.  Although it was busy, there seemed to be enough seating - some individual tables and some community with a few tables outside. The price seemed normal enough for me for lunch, and I was glad to have somewhere a little healthier to try."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and this was the first time my meal was not correct after ordering online. I get home and my citrus and Avocado salad had no chicken. After paying extra and having it as an addition I expected it to be there. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick dinner one night before running a few errands. We wanted something fast but not \"fast food\". We loved it. The service was awesome. The guy working the counter explained the menu to us and helped us decide what to order. I was torn between the sweet potato fries and the veggies as a side and he surprised me and gave us a side of veggies to try at no cost since it was our first time there. The veggie burgers were delicious and filling. Our food was ready pretty quick too. We basically paid the same as what we would have paid at Panera and we left way happier! We will be back."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes in this place. The customer service was the worst. They didn't make eye contact when I picked up my Togo order. I ordered the southwest salad and it was sloppily thrown together.  While I was in there the place was filled with smoke. They either didn't have vents or did not have them on. Their was over flowing garbage and garbage on the tables. The staff only seemed interested in talking amongst themselves. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Eh!   I was excited to try this new place on my lunch since they offer quite a few vegetarian options. However, I was less than thrilled with my food that I ordered. I chose the Adopted Luke veggie burger, grilled corn and strawberry lemonade.   Cons:   Taste: While the quality of the food may be great, the taste is not \"good\" at all. Nothing on my veggie burger was seasoned. It was extremely bland  and unappealing.   Price: I paid $14 + for a veggie burger, side and drink -_-    Pros:   Customer service: I ended up requesting a new corn on the cob after  I saw that I received the smallest corn that they had on the grill. It was extremely small to the point that It shouldn't have been sold at its normal price of almost $5. The employees settled this issue quickly and even offered that I keep both cobs (I declined ).   Grilled corn: Though my original corn was tiny , it was replaced with an average sized piece that was pretty good. The jalapeño/ cilantro ranch was delish! It probably would be a great compliment to the bland burger that I got."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and delicious! It is a great healthy treat The only complaint is it takes a very long time for your food to be ready."}
{"text":"Great food and one of the best customer service experiences in any fast casual restaurant!"}
{"text":"Healthy and good. Very accurate name. The food I've had( approx 5 visits) has all been good, I think it's a little bit overpriced for what you're paying for. Would return again"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, and was kind of in a hurry so I did not get a chance to study the menu that well before choosing. I ordered a pretty basic burger with a gluten free bun, and I must say it tasted ...basic . All the burgers here are cooked 'well', you cannot choose. I do not doubt they use quality ingredients, but I wasn't blown away by the taste. I appreciate the time it took them to hand prepare my meal from scratch, the kitchen is open so you can witness them doing this. The restaurant itself is spacious, plainly decorated. I did enjoy the fresh juices/lemonades with herbal infusions. I'm sure there are greater things on the menu that I just need to go back a try."}
{"text":"B.good is the perfect spot for a healthy quick meal. The bowls are all fabulous and the baked fries taste better than fried fries! I would seriously eat every meal there if it were closer to my house. My kids love it as well. You really can't go wrong with any menu items -especially the crispy veggies!"}
{"text":"Good smoothies, shakes were subpar at best.  A little pricey as well.  I'll come back for the smoothies.  My friend had a turkey burger which he enjoyed."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is friendly. Prices however are a little bit much for the type of restaurant this is.  Especially if you are getting a burger.  If you don't mind paying premium price for the food, then you will like this place.  WIll most likely not return."}
{"text":"This place is a real disappointment. For $16 I got a turkey burger, small salad and a drink. The turkey burger was disappointing with a stale/dry bun. The burger reminded me of the old Wendy's commercial - \"where's the beef?\". The salad was sad- barely filled half of a container and looked nothing like the picture. It was in huge chunks and the dressing was just globbed in one corner of it. I will say the drink was amazing. For $16 they can serve a larger turkey burger, prep the salad better and have fresh bread."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a buddy and he suggested this place which I had heard about but not tried.  In short, it was great!  Once you figure out that the menu lacks things like pancakes or whoppers, you really have a good variety of tasty meals to select from.  I had the power grain with grilled chicken added.  You also had the choice of adding quinoa or something called 7 grain.  I tasted each and preferred the 7 grain as it justed tasted better with the barley wheat pieces and it was a warm item, very tasty.  My friend had a salad with large fresh chunks of avocado that looked delish.  Overall the food was excellent (5/5).  It's a simple counter order and they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. Simple and efficient (5/5).  Give it a whirl,  you'll enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and concept but you smell horrible when you leave this place. The exhaust must not work properly."}
{"text":"Still have ice in my smooth. Not a few cubes but a block of ice. Never had that happened in my life."}
{"text":"Got to check this place out today! Heard many good things. Went here on a Wednesday around 6pm and the place wasn't busy at all. 2 other people inside with food already, so many open tables.   Placing order was easy, no wait in line. We ordered one power burger wheat bun, side of \"real fries\", one kids chocolate milkshake. *TIP* if you download their app you can get a free side.    I liked that they have fancy lemonades and getting free side. Our wait time was ridiculous, it took so long for our small order. When they finally called our name, they told us our fries weren't ready yet but they didn't want us to wait since our burger was ready. We ate burger and almost whole shake before the fries came.   The appearance of the burger looked bomb! The bun and all the toppings were delicious, the taste of the burger itself - I wasn't impressed. The \"real fries\" which are their plain fries, were also pretty good! The chocolate shake was yummy! So overall just the wait & taste of their burger was disappointing considering price. I realize they are \"root\" based. Meaning they use fresh ingredients, locally from NC & SC which I love, so I kinda get the price. But the taste and wait, along with price explains my rating. I def still might give this place a second chance and hope they are better next time!   Good vibes from within. Workers were so so, not take friendly. They do have a healthy kids menu! $5.99. Kids shakes or \"kale crush\" smoothie both $2.99."}
{"text":"The curb appeal at this Ballantyne Village restaurant is such that I really didn't want to come here.   I am glad that I finally gave in.  It's refreshingly different.  The salad selections are terrific and better than at some of the fine dining restaurants.  I had the southwest salad and it was delicious.  The dressing was like a chipotle flavor. It had something crunchy and yummy in the salad.  I have no idea what it was, but it added a lot of fun to my palette!   I only wish the portion size had been a bit more generous.  The salad was served in a big round open bowl and the bowl was not very full.  My mother was with me today and she had a turkey burger and sweet potato fries.  The fries seemed to be finished off in the oven.  They were not greasy.  The place reeks of ORGANIC everything.  Even the beverages are unique and seem on the organic side.  Try the beet ginger drink; it has an amazing flavor.  I love the concept and love the food.  Sometimes It's good to have servers waiting on you and sometimes a pop in place like this, where you order at the counter, is just fine.  Personally, I would rank this food right up there with fancy places that charge twice as much.   I am surprised that I liked it this much.  Two thumbs up and I will return."}
{"text":"We went for take out and our salads were ready very quickly. They tasted good and were healthy."}
{"text":"Healthy? Yes. The burgers aren't bad but are not out winning awards. The Power Bowl and salads are going to suffice if you will; pro tip- get quinoa not \"power grains\" option.  2¢ - When they first opened they had a bacon avocado bowl that was awesome, they kept in on the menu for awhile and since it's been gone I really can't find anything I really like besides that."}
{"text":"I ordered a to-go Southwest Chicken salad from here. I ended up pulling out basically an entire stem with flowers coming off of it that was meant to be my greens I guess (flowers?? what??? I get that they're greens, but at least trim off the flowers), avocado skin, and the black bean and corn salsa were crunchy. I'm willing to give this place another try, but I doubt I will try this entree again. The people who I picked up my order from were very kind, and the place seemed clean, at least."}
{"text":"I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this restaurant and for it to be successful. But in the 6 times I've visited this and the other nearby location I've left without my food twice. I like to call ahead and grab and go. On multiple occasions I have called and no one would answer. Recently I called, a woman took my order, but when I arrived there was no record of it until they played detective and found the worker did not \"send the order back\" to the kitchen.  Then the woman came up to me and said yes she took my order but since she did not see my phone number on her caller ID she didn't bother to send it back to the kitchen staff. She did not apologize.  Her attitude was as if it was my fault. I asked her if she asked me for my phone number and she acknowledged that she had not. I don't think she got my point.   On this same visit while I was waiting in line to \"pick up my food\" (ha ha) saw the shift manager wrestle huge bags of garbage out through the side door. I then watched him go back directly to the kitchen and then ask if he could help me figure out where my food was.  He wanted to make my food while I waited. He was very nice but seemed surprised or a little put off when I suggested he wash his hands first (after handling the garbage). He gave me a look like how dare I be such a pain in his a66.  He then left and quickly came back putting on latex gloves. I decided to just leave. I called back to speak to the owner and 'resentful glove man' decided to lecture me on the difference between owners and managers in a franchise situation. After much convincing he finally agreed to pass my phone number on to a manager. WHEW!!!   I'm SO GLAD I didn't let this guy fix my food and just left.  I have a rule: I never eat food prepared by someone with any amount of resentment for me. Even if it is undeserved. I have seen the You Tube videos of what kitchen staff do to your food when they play God with your health.   What's frustrating is i was going to use the coupons on this visit that one of the MANAGERS had given me as a refund of my money from my purchases during a previous bad experience.   Like I said, I REALLY wanted to like this place. But they are not ready for prime time yet."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the service is very slow, my beef patty burger was completley raw and cold in the middle. Will not be returning here and would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"More like B Okay.  I was excited to try B Good because to my knowledge, it's the only place in Uptown where you can order a burger with a gluten free bun. My interests may be niche, but nonetheless I was looking forward to giving this place a shot.  My first impression was that this place hasn't been finished yet. The restaurant is cavernous and stark with high ceilings and no sound absorption. It's deafening during the lunch rush but I'd imagine it's nearly as loud even when they're slow.   The layout is awkward. You place your order to the left, but there's hardly any room to queue up. This leaves patrons looking at one another in confusion, asking \"is this the line? Are you in line?\" The waiting area is in the center of the counter and it seems to be where everyone ordering to-go awkwardly gathers.   I went for lunch with a coworker and ordered first. I got the Cousin Oliver burger. When the woman behind the counter asked what cheese I'd like, I assumed that meant I had options included. Not so; when I got my receipt I saw I'd been charged $1.25 to add cheddar. Brutal.   After ordering to dine in, you're handed a buzzer and left to your own devices. We grabbed a table in the back and waited for our buzzers to light up. The plush chairs along the windows look comfy, but they're far too low for the tables and you'll feel like a child. If you're dining in, you'll have to leave your seat to go up and claim your meal. I'd imagine this is a real pain if you're lunching alone; abandon your table and you may return with nowhere to sit. I guess the cheese upcharges don't pay for a food runner.  My burger looked beautiful when I picked it up. You'll have to go to the right of the counter to get ketchup and mustard -- no other sauces or condiments seem to be available. As such, my burger felt very dry as I ate it.   The fries, by the way, don't seem to be worth the additional cost of including a side. Mine were pale and limp, without adequate seasoning (and only ketchup to dip 'em in, as noted above).   All told, a cheeseburger and fries set me back $14. I'd happily shell out this much for a great, flavorful burger, but that's not what I received. I wish I could offset this with high marks for service, but there really isn't any service, other than borderline predatory upcharging at the register.  Maybe it's my mistake for ordering a burger at a healthy lunch spot. I'm not against giving B Good another try with another dish, but I'm not in a rush to return."}
{"text":"40 minutes for a burger and fries.  Talk about a break down in the process.  The person expediting the orders is also responsible for cooking the fries and making the smoothies at the other end.  Sorry B Good, but you're falling really short on the name and you R Bad.  Long story short, if you'll only have 30 mins to grab a quick healthy bite, this ain't the place to go.  45 mins and I left with a cold burger and soggy fries."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite while in the area, this happened to be right next to where I parked so I decided to give it a try.  They have a few healthier eating options available.  I went with the Mediterranean chicken bowl which included:  romaine, farro, grilled chicken, tomato, cucumber, green beans, feta, red pepper hummus, mint, sunflower seeds and za'atar vinaigrette.  It hit the spot at the time, nothing amazing but it was filling and lightweight.  Plenty of veggies and the vinaigrette added a nice flavor to top it all off."}
{"text":"Love B Good! Expensive but worth it. The salads are amazing! My favorite is the Kale. I also enjoy the Turkey Burger. The Zucchini and Veggie meatballs are tasty. Ask for a coupon, and on your next visit you can buy one burger or salad and get one free!"}
{"text":"So healthy and good! Zucchini noodles with eggplant is perfect lunch! I added chicken to it   Ability to order online makes getting lunch there easy and quick"}
{"text":"It was my first visit today and had spicy Avocado with lime,kale and chicken bowl. It was so good that i immediately texted my friends about coming to this place often. Food is not only healthy but taste delicious too. They have lot of other heathy options too, i will definitely try all of it one by one. :)"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place has potential. I ordered a vegetarian bowl and smoothie. 15 mins later I was still waiting for my to-go order. The staff was extremely disorganized and were losing orders. I was grossed out to see them just slopping orders together, work area was disgusting as well. I heard several people come up and ask how much longer and had their order made on the spot, I'm assuming it just never got made. I asked about a couple of food ingredients and when the staff asked the manager she simply said, \"I don't know\". The cashier came back and told me they don't know what's in their food because their food doesn't have labels on it. For a place that's all about healthy, farm fresh etc. your staff better be informed on what's in your food. I finally requested a refund and left. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the staff is less than. From the bathrooms to the front to the ordering counter.  Lady cooking has 1 inch nails...OMG!"}
{"text":"You know I wish I could give this place 0 stars but yelp wouldn't let me.  First of all, my friend was eating her \"greek\" salad and there was weeds in the salad. It looked liked it came straight out of the ground, who would want to eat that? Also, sunflower seeds are not greek you uncultured swines. Next, my other friend was eating her sweet potatoes and it was the next level of soggy. It's like you steamed the potato cut it up and then served it.. That's not true culinary fries. Also there  was a loud noise occurrence during my meal  This place is called \"b good\" but it should be called \"b better\"    Thank you for your time"}
{"text":"The place can definitely help you \"B. Good\" with better eating habits. I am in love with the the this place. The have an amazing clean eats menu. I have yet to find anything on the menu that i didn't care for. If you are looking for something different try the veggie burger and Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"The food is fairly pedestrian. Unless I missed something or came in the wrong day, the food is what you eat when you make \"healthy\" burgers at home. Some come here for that I guess. But you risk the longest wait in Charlotte.  I am sitting here waiting for a smoothie that I ordered at 2:08.  And it just crept past 2:30. It doesn't take 20 minutes to make a smoothie when the store is empty. The smoothie machine isn't even moving.   There seems to be 4 staff \"on break\" while 2 cook and 1 cleans. How could it possible take this long?  Update: 30 minutes after ordering they waved at me across the room to tell me they are starting my order."}
{"text":"Harvest kale salad has been my fav salad so far. Four stars because their to-go portion is significantly much smaller than what you get if you dine in."}
{"text":"Loved it! Came with the hubby and my 4 yr old and loved the flavor and knew my body was getting good nutrients"}
{"text":"Love it! This place is great for lunch or dinner whether you want a burger and milkshake or salad and a smoothie.They have something for everyone and everything is fresh and made to order. I had the turkey burger and fries and both were excellent! Staff was very friendly and quick with my order, without compromising quality. I can't wait to try the avocado bowl next!"}
{"text":"Interesting and excellent burgers! Strawberry lemonade drink was really good too. I used their app to order and pickup."}
{"text":"Our team ordered b.good in for lunch during a work meeting.  This is very convenient because they have an app (you can skip the line!!) and it's close to our work space.   I ordered the spicy avocado lime bowl with chicken and it was really good.    I think the new location is still working out their kinks, but it's nice to have a healthy restaurant to grab lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"I had the El Guapo burger and it was outstanding. It's a burger with jalapeño slaw and mayo so I was hoping for a little bit more heat but that's a really small complaint. Excellent flavor. Also had eggplant meatballs which sounded risky but they were incredible. You definitely pay a premium here but you're getting a much higher quality meal so it's worth the additional expense."}
{"text":"There grand opening if downloaded their app you got a free salad so myself an my coworker thought we would give it a try.  The salad was huge with grilled chicken an quinoa an fresh blanched green beans an corn mmm an avocado. My coworker ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. They had 2 juices we wanted to try an the staff was so nice to let us. One was a beet juice  and something lemonade . Im a diabetic an of those juices like viva chicken not healthy tons of sugar. Well that beet juice was not very sweet an was good. They have a veggie burger says its homemade but they do not carry non dairy cheese. My friends are vegan so always looking for places we can eat together. The food was great i loved my salad I wouldn't have  just ordered that normally but ill order it again. My coworker said the chicken sandwich was good but she did add cheese which was an extra charge Im not a fan of up charges for items that should come with or on your meal. They have fresh cut fries baked not fried an sweet potato as well."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful store. We came in and ordered a bowl and forgot to request no cheese. We felt bad when we had to ask them to remake it with no cheese. The manager (Sean I believe) was wonderful and gracious and quickly had it remade without cheese and then boxed up the other order for us to take home.  We were not made to feel bad or uncomfortable about it, the team here is wonderful and accommodating and we really appreciated that."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food at a great price.  Looking forward to stopping by again!  I got the spicy avocado lime bowl with greens and added chicken after missing lunch today and it was the perfect amount of food that I needed!"}
{"text":"Normally the words \"be good\" and \"burger and fries\" don't go together.  I was in a burger mood and checked our B.Good Ballantyne.  Best burger I've had in the area and the hand-cut oven fries were delicious (and not greasy)."}
{"text":"For those from nyc this is similar to dig inn with more options.  There are meat and vege options.  They have a huge menu though I did not have to wait long for my salad.  It was big and delicious.  The ingredients are local with the farm they came from on a sign.  They even had the de riguer Maine root soda.  The place could use a bar with stools against the window for those eating alone.  It was not busy so are at the family style large table."}
{"text":"It's easy to eat healthy here. Some intriguing things on the menu from Burgers to Grain Bowls. I went with the grilled chicken Southwest salad with avocado. It was the perfect size for lunch and quite tasty. I'd like to try the Burger but  just seems like of all the things on the menu you'd be better served with something else."}
{"text":"Ok so this one has taken me a while to review as I LOVE the concept, values and ambience of this place. However, after giving them \"the benefit of doubt\", eating and spending my money in multiple occasions by the 5th time I am giving up. So get ready to read my review:  1. Horrible customer service. 2. Constantly understaffed (no reason their service sucks). 3. Super expensive for the quality and portions. 4. Who serves SOGGIE fries more than 3x in a row? 5. Please do not call an \"eggplant ball salad\" a bowl full of kale, 2cherry tomatoes and 4 mini eggplant balls.I do have to say these eggplant balls are delicious. 6. Please have your personnel know and learn of your products, dishes and menus.  7. Extra toasted buns is very different than burnt buns.  8. Stick to your personnel even if you hire teens and temps, please let customers relate to at least one familiar face.   Have to give credit on the fountain natural drinks that's super!  I still have hopes on management taking some of these constructive feedback for the best turnaround, as the potential for this brand and overall restaurant is over the charts!!!   With much love and care,"}
{"text":"I grew up a vegetarian. But not just a vegetarian, almost a raw vegan. My family has always cooked veggies and proteins in such flavorful ways. Because of this, I have acquired a special sense to good healthy food. B.good does NOT have that sense. First of all, when you walk in you are greeted by an excessively large lobby where you have to go pretty close up to see the menu options. It is cold and kind of lonely, but I chalked that up to the fact that it was brand new and hadn't been worn in yet.   Then, once I got to front with my two friends (one of which ordered a turkey burger ahead of me), picked my burger out from the options (mind you, I am starving), I paid $16 dollars for my burger and a small side of fries. Again, I give them the benefit of the doubt because it is a healthy, all natural restaurant and these places tend to be a bit pricey. So finally, we sit down to wait for our food, the restaurant is COMPLETELY EMPTY except for us, and my friend has his turkey burger within minutes. But, my bean burger took a whopping 20 minutes while I watched them laugh it up and talk in the kitchen, NOT MAKING MY FOOD. I finally was so irritated that I went up there and asked about my food. They said \"Oh, we have to make everything fresh so that's why it's taking so long, we'll bring it to you.\"   That was fine, but when I got my food I was so unbelievably UPSET. I paid all of that money for a simple burger and it was soggy, tasteless and the burger didn't even stick together. It fell apart more and more with every bite! And the fries were tasteless too!   Anyone who recommends this place, seriously must not have any taste buds. I will not be going back nor will I be recommending it to anyone in my family most of which are vegetarians. I wouldn't want them to waste their money."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Great food, great service! I love that almost every single ingredient is locally grown. The freshness and quality are obvious in every bite. So many vegetarian, vegan and meat eater options. This place reminds of California! I only wish it was closer to Rock Hill."}
{"text":"I gave this place 1 star solely based on the my customer experience here. This is by far one of the most unprofessional restaurants I've been to in a long time. I walked in and approached the counter with no acknowledgement. After I spoke to the cashier she then simply replied \"yes.\" Staff was having personal conversations and were extremely loud. The food was great but based on the customer service and experience I will not be coming back here nor recommending this place to anyone else. There's way too many options here in Uptown to slack on customer service."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, both times, a bowl or salad thing and both times I loved how healthy it was and how good it tasted.  However, I do have two complaints that really bugged me both times.  1) It is so loud in there.  There are a million hard surfaces and nothing to absorb the sound.  I had a hard time hearing my lunchmate talk.  This could be easily solved with some design choices that soften the clatter.  2) I wonder if their hoods are sufficient.  Both times, my suit smelled like good after I left which made me feel like the exhaust is inadequate.  Not the biggest problem in the world except almost everyone eating there is in work clothes and would prefer not to dry clean because they are there.  The good is so good, I will overlook my complaints but would be so happy if those changes got made."}
{"text":"I have loved this restaurant in Raleigh and now this one is in BALLANTYNE. Get in her often. Local real food prepared with amazing flavors. Gluten free and Vegan options. Awesome awesome awesome. Salads, burgers, Grain Bowls and sides are all very great and they use regional farmers and cheese people as well as beers and cider. Woop woop woop. Love this place. You have to check it out."}
{"text":"I'm visiting the Ballentyne area and was struggling to find some good clean eats until B good! Food is prepared to order and everything is super fresh. Highly recommend the spicy avocado and kale bowl With quinoa. It's delicious and super filling. Service was also very friendly. I'll def be checking out B good before I leave for some more clean eats."}
{"text":"B.Good should be renamed to B.Great or B.Absolutely Fantastic! I stumbled upon this place today by accident and was thrilled to encounter a burger and fries that was made with such high quality ingredients and in such a clean way it literally tasted different. I know that all burgers and fries taste different but B.Good's food tastes unusual and in a fantastic way. The burger and fries did not taste like most restaurant's burgers and fries...you can taste the freshness in B.Good's ingredients. The bread tastes freshly baked, the meat is flavorful and juicy, the vegetables are farm fresh and the fries are flash fried in new oil so the potatoes absorb less grease and have this perfect micro thin fried exterior + soft goodness on the inside. They're dusted with sea salt and honestly this description does not do them justice. They've got unique sources for their ingredients so be sure to try everything. Keep an eye on the details like the taste of their ketchup and the selections at their soda fountain - it's all special, unique, and delicious. And on top of the great taste and high quality ingredients, B.Good is well priced, clean and comfortable inside, and has friendly staff members. The only feedback for improvement that I can offer is that they might look into eco-friendly utensils and cups. They're doing well w/ their to-go trays (recycled heavy duty paper material) but there's still room for improvement (i.e. biodegradable utensils, cups/lids, etc.). Also, set up recycle/compost bins next to the trash (like in Whole Foods)...that would take B.Good's eco-consciousness vibe to the next level and set a good example for the rest of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was skeptical. I'm not always a fan of places that specialize in uber healthy \"good-food\" choices.... I like a fat-greasy burger with non-organic fries - but - perhaps I should reconsider. This place was great. I was impressed with the sizes of the entrees (you won't leave hungry). It's always scary (for me) to go full on vegetarian when I'm starving, but I took the risk this week when I visited B.Good and whoa nelly, color me impressed. I ordered the zucchini spaghetti with eggplant meatballs and oh-my-yum. I'd definitely order it again. The flavored waters available up front are also pretty tasty. It was ~400 calories for lunch out, I was satisfied and it was quite good. I just wish I could convince my family to join me one day, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. (they prefer grease laden burgers)! Looks like I'll have to settle for work lunches with colleagues and the fact that this place isn't busting at the seams at the lunch hour is actually an added bonus. Better get in there before people catch on... healthy can be cool."}
{"text":"The food here is good but doesn't seem worth the trouble. It seems like when the manager isn't no one else cares. I received the wrong order once which was a total waste and then the next time I called ahead by at least 20 minutes because I was in a rush but the staff didn't even start preparing the food until I was there which took them over 10 minutes to put together. I know if the manager was there that never would have happened, I guess the key is not to go at night."}
{"text":"This. Place. Was. Not. \"GOOD\" Service- terrible Food- not that great. Took nearly 30 minutes to get said food and it definitely wasn't worth that wait. Because it took so long we thought our buzzer wasn't working so I went to the counter to ask and our food was just sitting there getting cold.  The guys working, definitely noticed me standing there but were too busy having a personal conversation to acknowledge me,  2 minutes passed then he finally turned to me and said in a dismissive manner \"yea that's yours\".   I had ordered a smoothie but they hadn't made it and that was their reasoning for not buzzing us that our food was sitting out getting cold. I waited and waited for the smoothie.  Another 10 minutes passed and I finally told them I never got it and they had put it in the freezer and never notified me with the buzzer or otherwise that it was ready.   Employees did nothing to make up for their many mistakes.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Words can't express how absolutely disappointed I am in the take out service I received at B.GOOD  in Charlotte, NC! Not only was my food not ready in time, but it was sloppily thrown together. Even better? When I got home and opened my food, I find my burger bun completely burnt. On BOTH SIDES. Their employees consciously put this obviously burnt sandwich in my bag with no problem. I drove uptown on one of the busiest nights for this meal & deserve much better service than I received. Please do better. I couldn't  even go back to remedy this because the restaurant was already closed. I have excused the poor service in the past because your food is so good, but tonight was inexcusable.   What makes this worse? Over 17 hours and no response from B.Good. I've contacted them on various platforms. We all deserve better when we spend our hard earned money."}
{"text":"I've now been three times since they opened and I've been sadly disappointment all three times....mostly in the service. I really want to like b.good and I want to be a frequent customer on nights when I'm too tired to cook, but they've got some serious customer service issues that need to be worked out or they'll never survive in this area. My first visit was the best of the three except that they served my sister the worst grilled cheese sandwich, fries and broccoli I've ever seen. I'm actually shocked that they weren't embarrassed to hand her that meal. My Southwestern Chicken Salad was absolutely delicious! When we returned the second time, we were both charged extra for the chicken on the Southwestern CHICKEN Salad despite my long conversation with the cashier when they asked me if I wanted \"chicken\" on my salad??? The staff seems clueless and whoever is responsible for training them is doing a terrible job! I also asked them not to put the fresh tomatoes on my salad but they did anyway. Tonight, I called my order in because I had previously had to wait SO long for my order.  I again asked for no tomatoes. I actually had a pretty lengthy conversation with the gentleman who answered the phone about my order, stressing to please leave of the fresh tomatoes. When I arrived, there was one customer placing an order and no other customer in the restaurant.  I went to the pickup counter and noticed that I had tomatoes on my salad.  I didn't say anything, because I could just pick them off. The salad was also half the size of the one I got the first time. The thing that has pushed me into writing this review is that I stood there for 8-10 minutes waiting to pay for my order and the other 3 employees who were working never even acknowledged that I'd been standing behind this woman forever. I wouldn't have expected that pleasantly CLUELESS young man to stop helping the woman ahead of me, but the fact that they weren't busy, they knew I had a to-go order because they gave it to me, and yet they still let the young man stands there searching for buttons on the screen without offering to help me, or at least acknowledging that I'd been waiting an unreasonably long time.  I'd hoped that they'd have a chance to work out the kinks,  but they seem to be headed in the wrong direction. It will be very hard for me to return, which makes me sad.  I really like the Southwestern Chicken salad....even if they ask me if I want chicken on it!"}
{"text":"I ordered online for 6 people. I love the options of fresh and healthy foods. Especially that they offer gluten free burgers (turkey and veggies for non-red meat eaters like myself)! The order included : 2 strawberry banana smoothies, roasted butternut salad with chicken, 2 zucchini spaghetti and eggplant meatballs, one Caesar salad without the chicken, Spivey avocado and lime with quinoa and chicken, spiced pumpkin smoothie and southwest salad. Everything was devoured! It was fresh and made on time- which I appreciated not having to wait. It was annoying with all the construction downtown - and no parking -to pick up so many \"to-go orders\" . I defied the law and just parked our front anyway... I will say I think the serving size is a bit small for the price. If you don't get certain ingredients like black beans or chicken added, I would say you're definitely not getting your money's worth AT ALL. Luckily I beat the lunch rush hour  so the lines weren't out the door. The place is trendy and cute like a farm to table feel. Staff was busy so didn't interact much- to rate their customer service. This is definitely a place I would try once on my own but order for company lunch especially if your staff eats healthy. Everyone absolutely loved their shakes including me. I do wish they labeled the salad dressings flavor- it's hard to determine who gets what salad dressing when there's for different salads and 4 different dressings. This is a solid 3.9 in my opinion."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!  LOVED IT!  The turkey burger, west side style, was on point.  I got a side salad with it, citrus avocado, and felt amazing after I ate it...so fresh!  My husband tried the American burger with crisp veggies and surprisingly enjoyed it as well (I'm slowly converting him on to the eat healthy eat local craze...and I'm winning!!!).  We will be back in a few days again I'm sure, perfect for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food at a very convenient location. Good amount of choices and loving being a family member great perks!!"}
{"text":"Prices were affordable...got the kale salad, green chile bacon burger and fries plus a drink for $22, not bad at all, everything was delish!!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I went here for lunch and it was pretty good, but quite pricy. I was ok with the price though because I easily got 2 meals out of my spicy kale and avocado bowl- it was huge!! I got mine with grilled chicken, but honestly I don't even think it needed it. I also had the sweet potato fries which were delicious! My coworker had a burger which he said was good. The service was quick and easy and I will definitely be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  Everything looks fresh and is on display.  I'm hooked on this place.  I ordered the Kale salad and it was on point.  You walk in and order, they give you a buzzer and you wait to be called. Simple, fast and just what you need for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Location is good, for a Sunday lunch food came out quick - trash is at the front when you walk in so kind of tough to get around the people standing in line, other than that no complaints!"}
{"text":"very healthy.  just the way i like to eat!   friendly staff.  not necessarily local farmers fare, but close enough"}
{"text":"Whoa this place is bad.  Dirty plates, cold bun, no napkins, tables were dirty.   Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was delish! I got the spaghetti and meatballs which was made out of zucchini noodles and eggplant. I crushed it! I will definitely be back! Can't wait for my next visit. Oh,  and I got the kale crush smoothie and I'm not even a big kale fan. Couldn't taste the kale at all! It tasted so refreshing!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  I wished I could say I love the decor but I just don't.  It's not cozy, good thing the food is so good."}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free selection. Very happy with the gf buns as well as the many ways to get bowls/salads/etc and stay gf. Loved the fries and my friends who are not diet-restricted were very happy with the food as well. Enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Quick. Wholesome. Friendly. Tasty.  This is my go to lunch spot above all others in uptown. It doesn't matter if you're a hungry hungry hippo or just in need of a quick smoothie B Good has what you need. They over a plethora of vegan and vegetarian options and  they also have meat. It's hard to find a good gluten free bun, but B Good has one. Do your self a favor and try the vegan burger. Dress it up any way you see fit, you won't be let down by this tasty handheld. Oh, and before I forget, order the damn sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"I walked in with high hopes of finding some local vegan options, but left unable to try any food.  I have a severe dairy allergy and asked the two girls at the front counter about dairy being included in the chipotle spread. One looks down and could not answer and the other said \"it's all packaged so we don't know what's in what, but I think it says processed with dairy\". That works, but made me want to ask about the bread. I then was told that Gluten Free means no dairy. She repeated this 3 times and got louder each time and could not answer a simple questions without being argumentative when she's clearly ignorant.  They need to train their employees to know simple ingredients. I explained that I would go into shock/die if I ate dairy and they continued to say gluten-free means no dairy. It should have been embarrassing for them, but I just put down the menu and left. Basically, DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE SEVERE FOOD ALLERGIES."}
{"text":"This place is insanely fresh. The quinoa bowls and salads are great. The service is super fast and even the smoothies taste great. Highly recommended for a delicious, casual, healthy meal."}
{"text":"This was the worst place I have been to in the history of places. I'm the ONLY vegan and all of my friends had regular burgers. All of them were a disaster. Their fries are microwaved! It's not the employees fault. It's a horrible business. We waited forever to get our orders out of order. They don't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"The food tastes good. I had a local apple and bacon bowl, and asked for the vinegar on the side. It was a good idea since the vinegar was very strong. It's relatively pricey for the amount of food you get, but still enough food to satisfy an empty stomach. Four stars for good food and service with a slightly unreasonable price tag."}
{"text":"Vegan fast good? Why didn't I think of that! This is a cute spot in Stonecrest if you're looking for good, healthy food made quickly.  Staff could tell that my friend and I were new and they were patient, kind and helpful.   I gave up red meat a few months back and I've really wanted a burger since then! So I chose a turkey burger. There are several \"styles\" you can choose from to add toppings to your regular, turkey or veggie burger. I went with an ala carte version, adding an egg and cheese to mine. My friend selected the veggie burger. Both were very tasty. My turkey burger was tender and more juicy than a typical dry turkey burger. I love sweet potato fries so i chose that as my side. I'm used to them being more on the sweet side but these savory hand cut ones were quite tasty! My friend thoroughly enjoyed her eggplant meatballs as her side.   Will definitely be back to try some of the amazing looking salads!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight for dinner. Had one of there salads and their regular fries. Amazing dinner, I will return"}
{"text":"If you're looking for locally sourced and healthy food, B. Good is the place to go. Customer service alone surpasses Living Kitchen in Atherton by miles. They made sure my 4 year old daughter had a wonderful experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great addition to South Charlotte options!  The avocado and lime grain bowl was fantastic!  Good size portion and nice and tangy!   The kids menu is great, we had two clean plates for once!   The assortments of lemonades are a nice touch as well.     We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good quality burger and salads. The potatoes fries also is on heath way ... the bake the fries instead deep oil. West side burger is the one I love it . Also this review is for the stone crest location"}
{"text":"Upon entering place seemed good. We then saw it had a low grade score for sanitation, cleanliness etc. we decided to stay anyway. Food was really not very good and didn't seem fresh. Then I got a Black fingernail in my salad which made me vomit. I felt bad for the girl who lost her nail in my salad because she was really nice and apologetic."}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian and vegans dream come true. All the food served is fresh and you can taste it. Everything sounded so good and I couldn't decide, so the manager helped us out a bit with some fan favorites.  He actually explained the concept and said they will be expanding. The lemonades were different, but refreshingly delicious. I ordered a Mediterranean salad and it was enough for 2. When I'm feeling healthy and like I'm getting my life together this is definitely the spot to come too.  Oh and they give discounts for Ballantyne Corp. Card holders."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this new uptown location. Burger was raw and cold in the center. The kitchen staff just needs to slow down and cook the food."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places to eat. Fresh tasty food. Only thing I would change is that it was faster. But kinda hard to rush fresh made to order."}
{"text":"First time here. Got the Kale & Avocado bowl & it was delicious! The dressing was perfectly spicy & the portion was great- not small at all but not too big to where you have a food baby afterwards. Oh & the decor here is simple, clean, & modern with an emphasis on fresh & healthy food. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"In all fairness, we tried a second time before writing this review.  Both times we ordered online...  Bun burned  Fries cold Cheese not even melted  Called them on both occasions and all they said was sorry.  No attempt to make it right.  Sad service guys and poor quality food."}
{"text":"We went to B Goods restaurant for the first time last week.  The food was delicious.  It was fresh and inviting.   This is my new favorite happy place to go"}
