{"text":"We were waiting for this place to open up in the plaza, and got the chance to try it out today. Pricing was decent, and the layout of the restaurant was nice with an open feel to it. We ordered a a couple of egg scrambles (Greek and veggie) that came with home fries and toast, and the first thing we noticed was the more than sufficient quantity. Both dishes were good, although I found they added too much onion to the scramble. Home fries were big and plentiful and I was happy they used French's ketchup! The coffee was nice, and the service was friendly. We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The owners are on hand and will make to order even if its not on the menu! We go there every week at least once. Can be busy on the weekends but i have never had to wait for a seat or line up."}
{"text":"The food was ok, about what you would expect from a breakfast place.  My biggest complaint was the noise.  Between the very loud music and everyone having to talk above it, we couldn't have any kind of conversation and couldn't hear our child at all. 
I had a smoothie, very bland.  The scramble was good.  Staff were friendly and the food came out in a reasonable time.  
Expect to pay about $15/pp including a beverage."}
{"text":"finally a real good breakfast place in Whitby! 
When Southside closed there were no places with decent home fries, great prices, great coffee and service that deserves a great tip. I hope it stays forever and keep up the amazing hot food, great service and coffee!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but food was not good. Club House sandwich seems to be made with frozen processed meat :("}
{"text":"I ordered the club house sandwich with home fries.  The fries were cooked fairly well, but were surprisingly bland.  I don't normally salt my food, but I had to for these.
The club was okay, although it was a bit bland as well.  The biggest disappointment was that the menu listed cheddar cheese as a topping, but they used processed cheese instead of real cheddar. 
On a positive note, the staff seemed friendly and helpful and the food was prepared quickly.  The place was practically empty when I went though, so I'm not sure how they would be when busy.  I'll go back again to try the pancakes, but I'll stay away from the club in the future."}
{"text":"I was served green moldy bread.  I politely brought it to the attention of my server who told the owner who was on site at the time.  The owner didn't come over, did not apologize and claimed the rest of the loaf looked 'fine'. I was charged for the mouldy breakfast that I obviously did not eat.  I should have just called public health."}
{"text":"This breakfast we had this morning was terrible. :-(

The eggs were small and so watery they barely had any taste. The bacon was overcooked and thin. The home fries were just ok. So disappointing as we sent our food back. They comp'd our meals but still charged us for the coffee which we weren't offered refills on, and the juice for my son which was half water. I definitely will never go back. :-("}
{"text":"I came here with my family after staying at my Mom's place. It didn't look like much from the outside, but what breakfast place does? 

The servers were all very friendly. We were promptly greeted and they accommodated the six of us at a comfortable table. Our waters and coffees were never empty and the food was delicious! 

I got their breakfast special which was a standard: toast, 3 eggs, choice of meat, choice of side. It was only $5.99 before 10am! Afterward it's still only $7.99. Great value!

My only complaint, which isn't even a complaint - more so a preference is that I like my tomatoes to be slightly grilled when they are served with breakfast. 

All in all, I would definitely recommend this spot for people in the Whitby area!"}
{"text":"Breakfast for 2 early in a Saturday morning!

Order1: Big Breakfast with coffee
4 eggs over easy
Bacon 
Sausage
Home fries
Pancakes
Toast
Overall this meal was good. Nothing super fantastic awesome but exactly what was expected. A good way to start the day.
Coffee was just ok but they had Frank's hot sauce instead of Tabasco which scored huge bonus points.

Order2: Waffles with a side of sausage
Waffles were good, again nothing surprising but good and not overly sweet which is how I like them. They were served with fresh slices of banana, strawberries and blue berries. 
Side sausage came with 4 links instead of the standard 2 at other places.

The restaurant quickly became busy with many large tables coming in. There was only one sever in at the time but she totally rocked it until her coworkers came. Service was great.

Worth checking out."}
{"text":"There are many breakfast places around Durham that I have been to, this is one of the better ones.

First and foremost it's not so much the food that sets this place apart from others, but more the service. The servers here are expectional!!

The food also is not as greasy as similar type of establishments."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Prices are also reasonable, I would definitely recommend giving it a try"}
