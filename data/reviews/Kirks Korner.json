{"text":"The new owner sucks. I would go back for the other guests who all seem cool but makayla doesn't seem to know how to run a bar well and talked to the bartender, Sam as if she were below her"}
{"text":"I work here, and I play here, I'm always comfortable and have made a lot of friends here that I now call family. Our new owners are fun and attentive and are working to make this bar the best it can be.  I want to point out that they are very caring people and I'm not really sure where the previous commenter got the idea that they are anything but. I am a very happy employee, spoiled even, and I will continue to work and play in this bar as long as I'm able!  Ps, if I have ever shown my weakness to you as a bartender/cook/waitress  (I think those cold sloppy Joe's were totally my bad) I am sorry, I am still learning, and I do the best I can!!"}
{"text":"Nothing here but the usual Dive Bar feel. They have a grill and the food is the usual fare, nothing more - sometimes it's good and sometimes not.   This place has the usual tired setup for the dive bar feel, sometimes you get a good feel in here and sometimes you do not.   In the past I did visit this establishment on many occasions and the visits dwindled down as the place just settled into the aforementioned dive bar feel. Their prices seem to be in line with the other bars in the area, which fluctuate from time to time.  The restrooms are small as hell and semi-clean, better than some of the others around I must say.  Overall, I visit here on rare occasions any more, just nothing here to bring me in."}
{"text":"Kirks Korner is a family oriented bar where everyone knows your name. Go on down and grab a bite to eat, watch a sports game, shoot some darts, play pool or even sing karaoke. Great atmosphere and wonderful pepole. You just might even meet the owners Bob and Judy Kirk. See ya there."}
{"text":"Came here because we bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate. We had to ask the server for the certificate back because the two of us could not spend the $20 minimum required. Inexpensive food prices. We got burgers which were good. My complaint is paying $3 for a soda and $1.50 charge if I wanted to use my credit card. The place is nothing fancy; it's a sports bar. So if you are looking for a place to drink and shoot some pool this would be a great place for you."}
{"text":"Nope. Another dump, same as the others in the area. This place has seen its heyday come and gone, whomever owns the place is just administering CPR and hanging on. Prices are in line with the aforementioned dumps and their food is bar food - nothing more than that. Place is old and dank, atmosphere is artificial unless you're a regular (every bar has them). There's nothing special here, nothing whatsoever that would entice me back for another visit. You could take a pic of the bar and it would pass as any other dive dumps in the area. It pains me to rate this place truthfully, as I spent many years residing in the area and frequented this establishment on many occasions in the past. But, this place has not aged well, no matter how many coats of paint you use to hide that fact. Oh well, it's just a bar, nothing that is absolutely necessary to sustain a good life - there's plenty of much better pubs to enjoy. Peace."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in on a Friday afternoon with the hubs and use our restaurant.com coupon. The area it is seemed a bit sketchy, but we took our chances and were not disappointed. Pam the bartender was a delight and gave us a tour of the bar and told us some stories of the place. We then ordered he \"specialty\" for dinner and it was excellent, patty melts are my favorite and this ranked pretty high. The place has pool tables and dart boards galore, so if you are into that, this may be your go to place. Great juke box, service, food, and the place was super clean! We will go back!"}
{"text":"The greatest bar ever, the staff is friendly, the owners are great and the beer is cold. Fun environment, nice dart boards (steel tip), professional pool tables. With the pool tournaments and dart tournaments this is a up and coming spot to be with all new upgrades happening. Hearing rumors of new food getting added to the menu is very exciting, this place is going to explode soon so get in here and become a regular."}
{"text":"I've been in the area trying the small bars on Peoria Ave, and this is the nicest and cleanest of them all. Still has a nice corner-bar feel without being a dive. They actually have nice taps of beer like Sculpin and Moon Juice IPA, along with all your regular selections, for less than $5 a pint. Has a covered, enclosed, smoking area out back that you can drink in."}
{"text":"Worse experience ever! Waited 1/2 hour for food that ended up being cold (sloppy joes)... Took forever to get our tab! Quick 1 hour visit turned into 2 hours of pain! Extremely disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar to watch football or any other sport for that matter, play darts, pool or just have a beer and hang out. The people there are friendly and it really does have a feel of a Phoenix \"Cheers,\" where everybody knows your name.   There are pool and steel-tip dart leagues throughout the week and on Sundays it becomes Bears country, the favorite football team of the owners. They have drink specials and giveaways anytime the Bears score or win so it's a double-bonus for any Bears fan to come watch the game here.   Definitely the best Bears bar in Phoenix and the friendliest too."}
{"text":"My heart wants to give Kirks 5 stars but I'm being conservative since ppl generally associate 5 stars with Fancy! Great neighborhood bar. This is the best place for low key date nights! Cheap ICE COLD brewskis, great juke box, friendly attentive staff! They have expanded their menu & have karaoke now. After a 3 year break from Kirks due to a move & new baby, my guy and I had as much fun this past weekend as we did when we first started hanging out here 5 years ago!"}
{"text":"Amazing Bears Bar with a true Chicago feel. Excellent bar selection and great service. The highlight is definitely the entertainment. Darts, pool, video games, and SO MANY TELEVISIONS! This is THE place to watch football."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst bar I have ever stepped foot into. I was there on a Saturday night and some fat bartender was beyond biligerant and yelling at an older gentleman in the bar. She was rude and disrespectful, I could not believe that she even worked in that place considering how drunk you could tell she was. I will never step foot in this place again and will make sure to NEVER reccomend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Think I found my new Neighborhood Bar, the Bartender and Customers were super friendly. The beverages were ice cold and most importantly located very close."}
{"text":"Weird location for Kirk's Korner: stripmall bar in-between the Sprouts and payday loan store.  Killer setup with 3 50\" HDTVs on the main wall when you first walk in. Anyone sitting there has primo real estate for college or pro football multitasking. 1.75 draft  beers...maybe a bit more. I did not explore the other side but they had more TVs there. Smoking patio (of sorts) in the back.  There was a random cross-section of young and old people that all seemed to get along well. I recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, I can not believe the 5 star reviews. We went because we had a restaurant.com credit. The food was not very good and the service was horrendous. The place was dirty. It is true that the beer was very cold."}
{"text":"Lived in the neighborhood about a year before we knew this place even existed. In a strip mall in the corner of a Sprouts center.  Came with 4 other people for a few hours during happy hour on a late Friday afternoon.  At the time they only had a bartender, no waitress. Bartender acknowledged us soon as we walked in. Found a long high top table across from the bar. All but one ordered bottled beer. Beers were cold and rum and coke strong.  Ordered wings and onion rings to share.  Wings were really really good. Rings appeared to be hand battered, fried fresh. Food was standard bar food and we would order it again.  Early evening a waitress came on board.  Restrooms clean.   I'd say this is a middle aged persons bar. For someone just looking for a few drinks.  Nothing fancy. No drama. Pleasant staff. Pretty good food.   We will keep Kirk's in our rotation if we are looking to just get out or meet friends for a few."}
