{"text":"YUM! Ordered the XL pan crust 1/2 Hawaiian & half pepperoni w jalape√±os & I have to say it was easily the best pizza I've had! I also had a coupon for a free 12\" cheese with purchase of the XL and even though in not generally a fan of thin crust, it was just as delicious! 

Phone service was friendly, helpful and the pizza arrived on time! 

Looking forward to ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"First time going and feel no urge for a return visit. It was 6:30 on a Friday night and they didn't seem busy but still took 25 minutes to give me my order as I waited alone in the lobby. 10 minutes of it was looking at my order sitting on the rack with the single employee playing on his phone. He eventually looked up and checked in with me even after he was the one who took my order and handed me the bag. I ordered the Italian beef, fries and cannelloni. The sandwich was not impressive and the fries over cooked. The cannelloni was however very good and the crust still crunchy."}
{"text":"Very courteous service, very delicious cuisine, and a very phenomenal experience over all. I highly recommend if you're on this side of town and need pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was full of flavor! Lots of topings! Sauce is perfect! If i lived here in town id deff order again!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service, average food, and kind of pricey.  Ordered fettuccini alfredo pasta and that was kind of greasy. Maybe I ordered the wrong menu item. Overall, it's just okay not great."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! After being a customer of Rosati's for the past 3 years I've lived in Las Vegas I could not believe the attitude that was received when my roommate and I tried to order delivery this evening (because my roommate is very pregnant she had ordered and gotten delivery to our home last night) upon calling and then getting shot down we tried the other location an we're told that the Cheyenne location would deliver to us. After trying to call again the manager, who seemed to be completely inept, told us that the person who took our order shouldn't have done that.

 I do not believe the improper training of employees by management should be taken out on the customer. Coming from a house that is filled with people who work in the food industry, and know what it is the give a little extra for loyal customers, especially when it was your fault..we were pretty upset. 

The order we had was no small one either..they have lost us as customers and we will no longer refer our friends and family to these restaurants!"}
{"text":"It's ok. It's always noisy when I go there.  The wine by the glass is limited, and one of the two Chianties they serve is below average. Beer selection is fine. Service can be a little slow, so don't if in a hurry.  I've had a few of the non pizza dishes and I'm not really sure how to describe them except for not much sauce and piled high with a mystery meat. Stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"I have been their a few times to grab food and a beer.  They did a great job on the build out amazing bar with televisions everywhere and the food is top notch.  That's where it stops.  The service has a lot to be desired.  Recommend only for takeout."}
{"text":"When Rosati's opened in 2009, it was great!!  The owners and the people that worked there were awesome.  We went often. We had been to several Roasti's in the valley and LOVE their food.   Sadly, this Rosati's has gone down hill.  The people are very rude.  They don't get the orders right.  AND, I agree with the other comments. THIS PLACE IS FLITHY!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the Chicago style pizza. Check out the pictures I uploaded.

The staff was very warm and friendly, and provided excellent and fast service. Such good service is rare these days so extra points for that.

The Chicago style pizza had about 2 inch sides and a relatively thick (1 inch) crust for Chicago style. True Chicago style is not thick crust, however this crust was soft if spongy and the slice was not rigid. Look at the picture to see what I mean. The sides of the crust were crispy but relatively dry and did not have a particularly buttery taste. 

The toppings were good and spread evenly throughout the pizza.

The sauce was quite balanced, bordering more on the tangy rather than the sweet. I do think the pizza was a bit light on the sauce.

Price was about $20 for a HUGE and very heavy 16\" Chicago style pizza, not unreasonable considering the pizza weighed almost 7 lbs, easily feeds 3-4 people.

Overall this place has great service and very friendly staff (a rarity these days). It is one of the few places in the valley for Chicago style pizza and one that doesn't disappoint. However, I do think that Amore is still the best Chicago pizza in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Do you want to wait over an hour for a cold pizza?  and then deal with a jerk manager?  then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Took two hours to arrive. When I called to ask where it was, the employee was incredibly rude and defensive. He told me that there had been another order near my same location, so they kept my order sitting in order to deliver at the same time. Terrible customer service to start. When the food arrived, it was somewhat cold (obvious that it had been sitting)"}
{"text":"Great food awesome service received from Jen we had  good pizza and salad we had today"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery to work today with a group of folks. I can't speak on the topic of their pizzas, but as for my portion of the order...

First, the price quoted for a personal pizza over the phone was higher than stated on the menu on the website. As well, my portion of the order was charged a separate delivery charge from the main order - though it was all delivered together. 

Second, the garlic bread was burnt, tough, and gross. Even if you were willing to handle the texture and crumbling bread, you could taste burnt garlic, not just burnt bread. We threw it away. 

Third, the personal pan pizza (cheese with pineapple). I've had better pizza at various fastfood chains that don't claim to be \"authentic Chicago pizza\". The sauce especially - yuck. As stated in other reviews, extremely greasy and messy. 

If you want good pizza in Madison, go to Ian's."}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Never going back. Was told pizza would be ready in 35 minutes for pickup. Was actually 1 hour. The staff rolled their eyes when I inquired how much longer, and seemed to take their time in spite of my inquiry. The pizza was quite bland. I had to add salt to the pizza, which is weird because I've never had to do that with pizza. Never going back."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.  Hands down. Order the stuffed pizza. I thought it was better than Giordanos and Gino's East in Chicago."}
{"text":"The wait staff woman here is a total bitch. She has a total attitude problem and is rude as hell. She doesnt deserve a job there, grow up lady. Never been treated so poorly by a server. Food is awesome, service sucks ass. I will spend my money at a different Rosatis."}
{"text":"We used to enjoy pizza there, don't know what is going on there.    Pizza was burnt and flavor poor.   Woman who acted like a manager was like \"oh we all mess up sometimes\" and gave us $10 off.    I mentioned how the flavor wasn't like it used to be and she said that's just because of the way it was cooked.    We were police and my husband tipped way more than he should have even though he told me it tasted like burnt frozen pizza.   Employees didn't seem too concerned the food was bad.    Doubt we'll be back, way better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Try the double double definitely must have simply amazing food. A little taste of Chicago in Phoenix delicioso-"}
{"text":"Rosie is an excellent server! We look forward  to coming into the restaurant but for about the last 2 months the food has not been up to standards we have seen in the past. The pizza is way too saucy and has too much corn meal on the bottom. We are regular visitors to this Rosati's but our last 3 visits have not been the same as we experienced in the past. Has management changed or are there new cooks? We want rosati's to return to what real Chicago style pizza is suppose to be! I hope the kitchen can work out the flaws!!!"}
{"text":"We've drove by this place several times and always say we need to stop sometime.  Well,  we finally stopped in on Friday, June 18th for dinner.   We were greeted as soon as we walked in and were able to sit wherever we wanted.  One of the servers immediately came to our table and brought us cups & plates and we ordered the combo appetizer right then to get it started and then we were deciding which kind of pizza we wanted.   We didn't wait long for the appetizer,  maybe 10 mins, then we ordered our pizza which was maybe about a 15 min wait. ..wasn't long at all.  The appetizer,  which was a combination of fried foods:  onion rings,  mushrooms,  mozzarella sticks was so yummy and plenty for the 4 of us to share.  We ordered the thin crust meat pizza and it was delicious.  We ordered a Large for the 4 of us and we had leftovers to take home...we almost ordered an XL pizza. ..good thing we didn't because that would have been too much.   Overall,  we had an excellent experience.   There were 3 different servers who went to all the tables, including ours, to make sure everyone was ok or needed anything ...so they were very attentive so excellent customer service and the food is great.   We will definitely be going back in the very near future."}
{"text":"Hi I would just like to let everyone know that this pizza place has the worst customer service I have ever had the pleasure if experiencing. So I ordered over 100 dollars of food and was told that it would be to my house (which is 0.25 miles away I might add ) in 45 minutes to 1 hour. Ok that's cool it's a lot of food. So after 2 hours went by I called them and asked them what was going on they said sorry and the good was on it way. So another 30 minutes went by and still no food. Mind you I live a quarter mile away. So I called again and told them to cancel the order and the manager told me to just keep the food no charge. So I tipped the driver twenty bucks and started to feed my family. So I got a call back twenty minutes later that they changed there mind they wanted thee food back. So they sent the driver back to our house took the food and kept my twenty dollars I tipped him. So I had ate a few pieces of pizza and my family did too as anyone would being told to just keep the food no charge.  So they sent the driver back again and demanded money for the food and did not wAnt to give me the old food back. So all and all they wanted me to pay them for food that took almost three hours to get to my home a quarter mile away and after they had told me to keep it and without givin me anything back in return they demanded money from me and called the cops and were told they were in the wrong and now I called tonight and that told me they would not take my order and to never call back they will not serve me. So BEWARE of this place they will try to get you and they keep track of your number and in my opinion would bet that they tamper with your food if you have ever stiffed them on a tip or anything else. That is strictly my opinion and I have no factual prof that that ever happens. Strictly my opinion. So again BEWARE.  if you have read this far thank u for listing and sorry it was so long just wanted people to know what they are getting. Thanks"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Rained out at the softball fields and they did so much to keep us happy. 14 teenager girls and coaches. They reorganized the dining room passed out towels to dry off, and made us feel awesome and special. Pizza was great, and the service was too. This is a great place for a team lunch or dinner. Price was reasonable for the size of the party. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was ono for Chicago style pizza so I found this restaurant on Yelp.  The person who took my order was very nice and most of all got my order and address correct.  The driver with a smile delivered my hot pizza in 30 minutes.  I'm not from Chicago and know only of the Bay Area Deep dish pizza places.   I found Rosati's pizza delicious and it surely satisfied my craving for Deep dish pizza.  I would recommend this restaurant and will order from there again when in town."}
{"text":"This is used to be our favorite go-to pizza spot.  I always ordered a pepperoni pizza and the side salad.  Man, have I been disappointed lately.  It seems like each visit brought a decline in food quality.  For example, at one point the salad dressing was the best italian dressing I'd ever had.  It tasted home made.  Now it tastes like store-brand dressing.  Cheap.  

The last few pizzas we ordered were soggy and one had almost no cheese.  I miss the Rosati's from the days of yore.  We will not be returning.  For a great deep dish Chicago-style pizza we'll be eating at Chicago's up the road."}
{"text":"This has been my to go spot for many years.  I love their food.  I recently found out that its under new management. My favorite people are gone,  the menu changed,  my favorite foods are gone and even the ranch dressing is nn ot the same :( i must find another place now.  Sad. I will continue to order the usual pizza for pick up or delivery but not my hang out spot for wings,  salad and beer."}
{"text":"My Chicago style pizza last night had liquid dripping out of it.  Enough said - Rosatis is going to struggle with BuddyZ already here and Lou Malnatis on the way.

Save your money and go to BuddyZ out in Queen Creek for amazing Chicago style deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Well, this is hard! Love the Pizza and other  food. They just opened a \"sports bar\" great concept, same great food and staff works really hard! My first night was second night open, so everything is expected to be confused! My next visit was a Wed of following week, a couple at the bar and couple in one of the booths. No bar tender or servers, while I was waiting a couple came in joined me at the bar, after several minutes they choose to leave, after several more minutes I also choose to leave! After waiting several years for more places like this I hope management figures it out, they have the resources to make it work! My name is Larry and phone number is 310-488-3589 if you want additional input!"}
{"text":"The woman at the counter took my order. Very polite and professional...however.......it took almost 35 minutes with a slow amount of business (and for the record, I am a professional Chef, with a degree and almost 30 years experience)....... Not only did I wind up whistling to get SOMEBODYS attention.....but they got the order wrong .......so I wound up spending 52.95 on what I ordered and it was completely screwed up. How do you screw up wings and pizza?.... I also ordered a side of anchovies , which they charged me for, and I didn't receive. Apparently the \"strong arming people\" out of their money is a characteristic that they didn't leave in Chicago.........needless to say....I will not be returning to this joke of a restaurant. And there's better pizza and wings elsewhere...... Its sad really. If the \"kids\" in the back could focus on their job instead of cracking jokes constantly, the place might be worth going back to...but at this point, I can't see me returning. And believe me, I will be spreading the word. Don't forget (and you can tell this to the jokers in the back who call themselves \"cooks\", when people leave a restaurant they tell at least five people of their experience.....so they have , as I will so eloquently put it, shot themselves in the foot...."}
{"text":"Love Rosati's pizza. You wouldn't know it, but apparently there are two almost identical Rosati's chains in the Valley. The story is that the cousins of the original Chicago owners licensed the name to franchisees a few years back (myrosatis.com). This location is part of the original chain brought to the Phoenix area more than 20 years ago (rosatispizza.com). But enough with the history. The pizza is outstanding for take out. The thin crust is, yes, wafer thin and the Italian sausage is in big chunks as opposed to the rabbit pellets of other national joints. The stuffed pizza is a cheese-drenched meal in one slice. Sweet, chunky sauce with a bit of tang to it. But, what impressed me most about this specific place was the customer service. When I arrived to pick up my phone-in order, I was told it wasn't ready yet. They had made a mistake and were baking me a new pie. The manager was very apologetic and handed me a few cans of soda for my trouble. Sure, it was a small gesture on his part but now I know where I'm going the next time I'm hungry for some 'za."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! We ordered an order of fingers and the size was small they looked like they took frozen fingers and then deep fry them.  We also order fries it had no flavor and a calzone. 3 items totaled $27 with a 10 percent coupon what a rip off!!!"}
{"text":"after visiting my dentist near by, he referred me to rosati's, across the way. it  was
11 am, and they had just opened.  i was hungry and needed lunch.  i ordered
the small side salad which was very good.  i also ordered 2 meat balls (with meat
sauce) which was also very good. i ordered the chicken marcella, which was
also very good, and then took half of all of it home, for the next day.

food was served in a timely manner and hot, and the waiter was very cordial
and pleasant; plus i was able to listen to frank sinatra music!

i shall return for more good food."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison and the service is excellent! Its quick and the staff are very friendly !"}
{"text":"BLEH! Do not ... NOT ... order anything but pizza for delivery, and have tons of napkins or paper towels available to sop up the grease on that. We ordered baked lasagna dinner and ribs with fries dinner tonight. Fries were sloppy floppy sticky starch sticks I wouldn't give my pups (and they love their fries!). I had about 3 bites of the overly bbq'd undercooked ribs before I stopped because I didn't want to become ill. Cooked ribs should not be gray. Apparently the lasagna was ok, he ate that. 

Last time for this place."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza in this area. There are several pizza places near campus but this one is the closest place that has good chicago pizza and it reminds me of pizza back home (near chicago)"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. I like spicy Italian beef on garlic bread and their stuffed pizza (buttery crust). 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered last night. We live one mile away, took an hour and ten minutes to get the food delivered. The chicken tenders we ordered tasted like burnt rubber and were extremely dry. The chicken parmigiana sandwich, the chicken was disgustingly rubbery... The fries were also the crinkle cut fries and tasted like they were microwaved. Will NEVER order from here again. I used to speak so highly of Rosatis and their is just Zero consistency these days. Step up your game..."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place except the prices. The jalape√±o poppers and wings here some of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately as of lately they've raised the prices of their wings."}
{"text":"I love Rosati's, we always get thin crust & lately I've really been into their wings. Another plus are their coupons that double on Friday's. I've only gotten delivery & carry out, so I can't speak about the dine-in service. This is my #1 pizza joint followed by NYPD Pizza."}
{"text":"Great product, horrible service! And not just this location. Wrong orders happen frequently but more frustrating is being told my pizza was cancelled for delivery after waiting 1.5 hours. Why? because I am suddenly outside of their delivery area! Never a problem before! I am only 5.7 miles away according to Google, 11 minute drive time. I am done with this franchise. Had the same issues in two different parts of town. Great product, bad execution."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service is slow and friendly to slow and rude.  It just shouldn't take an hour to get out a chicken parm or a couple of pizzas.  If it truly is a busy night and you actually do need an hour to make my food, tell me!  Don't tell me 30 minutes and then start my order when I get there!  Then, when you've screwed up (again!) and I'm waiting on an uncomfortable little bench in a hot, cramped waiting area no bigger than a closet, offer me a drink, or something off my bill or what have you.  Don't act like it's my privilege to be there."}
{"text":"Why are your boxes so hard to open and close  aside from that your pizza is delicious so thank you ."}
{"text":"I wish that I could have given a better review.  The other Rosati's on Scottsdale Rd and Shea had great reviews and had pictures of the pie's that seemed really appealing.  The one in particular looked like a Chicago style with the sauce on top.  Lots of red sauce seemed like home to me so I decided to give this a shot.  

I ordered and got the pan which I was told was the right one.  I showed up 25 minutes later and it was ready for me.  There was a sweet young girl working there and I think her boyfriend was hanging out at the counter too.  They were both young kids that seemed like they could be a little rough (like I was at that age), and I thought that the average patron might be intimidated by this.  But to me it reminded me of a Rosati's that I grew up near outside of Chicago.  The employees always had their friends hanging around smoking and playing video games.  And this experience seemed like a walk down memory lane.

So I get the za and its huge.  Much bigger than I thought, but whose gonna complain about that?  Not me...that's for sure.  But when I opened it it was just a giant pan of cheese.  Not only was there not a hint of red sauce on the top, there was exceptionally little within the pie.  And the truth is that the cheese was really quite overwhelming.  Especially with very little to counter it other than the ingredients.  

Crust was decent.  To be honest, it would've been quite good had there been just a little less cheese and a sizeable portion of marinara.  If you read their competitors reviews the ones that always seem to score big points do so because of sauce.  So you'd think that they would use more or at least use enough that the average Chicago guy would be happy with it.

We ate about half and (this is horrible, I know) we threw the rest out.  We never do that.  But our guts were overwhelmed with the cheese and grease and it wasn't worth it to eat it as left overs.  It just plain wasnt good enough.

Oh well.  Maybe we will try it again and remember how to tell them that we want it.  It could be good...but the way that they seem to make it without instructions really would never make the grade back home.  And it isn't \"The water\"..."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying, we have had Melissa a few times now as our waitress, she sucks, tonight was no exception as she served myself and my family a brown lettuce salad, not a couple brown pieces, two whole plates of nothing but brown lettuce, enough for my 12 yr old daughter to ask,is my lettuce suppose to be brown? When I walked up to the front to ask her about it, she said she had no clue, they must've got a bad batch of lettuce from the produce guy, in which  I replied , would you eat it? I also told her that I had a bad vegetable one night that put me into anaphylactic shock in front of my kids, I was hoping that wasn't going to happen tonight!!!!! Instead of apologizing or offering new salads, I was told there was no brown lettuce back there, so,she didn't know what I was talking about!!!! I asked her if we were the only table then that were served it tonight? She kept trying to act like we wanted a free salad, really? What an ass, I told her I didn't appreciate it, and she was pissing me off, take it off our bill. She walked back to our table and then told us she checked the line, and all of the lettuce, she didn't know what we were talking about as she stood over our bowls of brown lettuce, we showed it to her.........her response, well I checked, I don't know what you're talking about,no apology yet, just trying to pick a fight. I told her I didn't appreciate her third lie about the brown lettuce, she was a fucking liar, and my husband told her get our stuff to go, why would you even serve that to a customer. She kept trying to talk really loud like we were saying something to her, I told her we are done with you you fucking liar get away from our table. She yelled really loud \" ma'am there our lots of families with kids in here, don't say those vulgar words, It's okay for the waitress to LIE to a customer and act like you're trying to get a free brown salad, and keep saying stupid shit to you, but don't cuss, you can lie, but don't cuss, Lol! What a joke, btw, the only kids in there were ours, 2 adults at the bar table, one guy in an orange shirt who I could hear her motherfucking us too, that's okay though, and a table of 3 adults, another lie by Melissa, there were no other kids, just our lying waitress. Upon using our groupon, I walked up to the register to give it to her to take it off the bill, didn't look at her, I waited to  get my phone back from her, silently, I was done!the whole time, she keeps saying  really loud, ma'am, please stop being so vulgar, there are kids in here, after about the 3rd time, and yes, you can check you're cameras Rosati's I stuck my hand up, didn't look at her, and said, ma'am, I'm done talking to you, you did nothing but lie,I'm waiting for my phone, my husband watched and heard the whole thing, after all was said and done,she charged us for our wing sauces, that we had to ask for, since she didn't even give them to us, cuz she was to busy being a jerk. she wasnt  supposed to be our waitress last night, it was a girl who had never waited on us, who she immediately got angry and kicked her right off the table, she knows we tip well, we actually could here her yell at her, did you take the drink order!, not nicely either. About a month ago, Lauren, another waitress, \" ask for her or Christy when you go in, much better experience, both sweethearts! \" had waited on us,we waited for our pizza for an hour, Lauren is coming out with it, when Melissa's yells at her to come back, only to take our pizza and give to her customers table, who had been sitting for maybe 15 minutes, no apology from Melissa, we watched the whole thing,you could hear her being Jerky to Lauren then as well, so, thanks to Melissa, 2 hrs later, we get our pizza to go. Wondering why you're place is slow, I would rethink having Melissa  serving people, doesn't care how she treats customers or fellow employees,doesn't care if she serves sub par food, obviously, steps on toes for the almighty dollar, the only reason she received the dollar and change tonight is, we round off, that's it. She got a dollar, and my husband and I both had the shits! Thanks Melissa! I will be calling the mgr. tomorrow to let him know  if that's the kind of help he wants serving his customers, we will no longer be frequenting Rosati's on Eastern. Great pizza, horrible waitress!!!!"}

{"text":"Food is good but has terrible service!!!! This is the third time in a row that  they mess up my order. First time, I ordered for pick up. When I showed up to pick it up, it turned out that the delivery driver had accidentally taken my order with him and I ended up waiting over 30 minutes for him to get back and get my food.  Second time I order for delivery. They showed up after an hour and 15 minutes and forgot half my order. Third time I ordered,  same thing happended. They took forever and forgot my drink and side of pasta I ordered. Seriously over this place and not ordering from here again. The food is not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. They have no idea how to make a pizza.
They advertise \"Chicago Style\" , they don't have any idea what that is.
The only reason I am giving it one star is because there isn't a negative star !!!"}
{"text":"I wish I was able to review the pizza here, but alas, I never even got a chance to try it. 
I called to place an order and was put on hold twice. The person that finally took my order was very pleasant and told me that they were busy, and our food would be ready in 40-45 minutes. We arrived an hour later, only to be told that our pizza hadn't been put in the oven yet. We asked when that would happen, and were told \"I don't know.\" We inquired, \"well, how long does it take to cook a pizza?\" and were told \"I don't know. The oven is full, so whenever there's room, I guess yours will be put in.\" We waited around 5 minutes, asked again, and were told again \"I don't know. Yours isn't in the oven yet.\" We would have loved to speak to someone that actually knew what was going on, but the only person in there over the age of about 18 was running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Yes, it was a Friday night, yes they claimed to be busy. But there were a total of two other customers in the place. 
The restaurant is incredibly poorly managed, and staffed by a bunch of people that couldn't care less if you ever get the food that you ordered. Basic questions, such as \"when we my pizza be ready?\" are met with a blank stare and \"I don't know.\" 
I wouldn't have minded waiting for my pizza if I was told an actual time it would be ready. My first job was at a pizza place, and I still remember (several years later), that our oven took 14 minutes to cook. 
Oh, and to top it off, the place is incredibly smokey and I know smell like I've been sitting by a campfire for hours. 
Get it together, Rosati's. Pizza isn't that complicated of a business."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. 
I order the fish for lunch sometimes. It has gotten progressively worse. 
Soggy fries and 1.5 hours delivery times. Last time I order here."}
{"text":"Decided to order pizza and wings on a Friday night after 10:00. I love hot wings so I asked the gentleman over the phone to mix their hot wing sauce with their sweet chile sauce for an extra-spicy 18 piece order. He kindly agreed and they turned out SCREAMING GOOD! Like really, really good. They wings were piping hot (temperature) when we opened the box at home, steam rising from each one to the point where we had to wait for the food to cool down. Love that freshness! 

The pizza was also fabulous! We ordered a thin crust with sausage, green peppers, and garlic. I have to say, it was a better tasting pizza than Oregano's (our former go-to fave). Also super hot, just pulled out of the oven, fresh as the sun is bright!

Take-home: Delicious, Fresh, & Made-To-Order Pizza and Wings! Friendly service & reasonably priced.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I ate there for lunch today. Super soggy crust... so disappointing. The whole pizza could have been baked more. Do they have to put it in the box in advance?"}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice.  Both times have been horrible.  We stopped in and stood at the counter for about 10 minutes while the girl ignored us.  Finally, after an excuse me, she helped us.  Maybe their other food is good, but the salads were horrible.  There was about a 1/2\" of water in the bottom of the bowls, the large salad I ordered was the same size as the dinner salad at twice the price.  Whatever they put in it was awful tasting.  I would not recommend, at least the location at 40th St & Bell to anyone."}
{"text":"I will stand by my review. I should clarify \"service is poor\". The gentleman who picked up the phone could do very little to answer my questions about specials, etc. I am fine waiting for food if I am told that it will take time. I was not told that. As mentioned, the manager was wonderful. He helped is out and gave us another pizza, I am fine with that. I have a closer pizza place that I grew up in and they make pizza from scratch. Literally. If this is what they boast, I am still not happy with an hour wait. I have gotten fresh pizza faster. I would still recommend and still eat there pizza. Nothing against that restaurant. I will keep in mind the time and more likely dine in."}
{"text":"If you are looking for deep dish close to the quality of Giordanos, this is your place. Be sure to order the Stuffed Pizza and not the chicago style (which is more like a middleweight). These guys do deep dish the right way, unlike del's where the crust is over half of the middle of the pizza. Great proportion of sauce, all of the cheese, and a generous helping of toppings. Forget del's! Come here and get better pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic, but they changed there sauce and now it's just mediocre. The sauce has little garlic flies in it. I ordered the pan pizza little to no sauce on it. I thought it was more. I think that now it's just over priced. I don't think I'll be ordering from here again unless something changes"}
{"text":"Love the Italian sandwich it is by far my favorite! Chicken Parm pretty delicious too. Prompt and always courteous delivery drivers."}
{"text":"Thank you, iPhone!  You took us to Rosati's, and we were delighted with everything:  the waitress, the coziness, the friendly customers there with us; and, of, course, the deep dish Chicago pan pizza. The slightly sweet, crisp crust; the savory sausage; the nutty warm cheese; that wonderful sauce!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have mostly had a good experience here. I prefer the thin crust over the deep dish (a sin being this close to Chicago). Their other food besides pizza is excellent, from fish sandwiches to pasta to burgers."}
{"text":"This is the pizza I grew up on in Chicago.  Very thin and cut in squares (deep dish was for tourists).  The Italian Sausage is good and not the \"pellet\" stuff you get in other pizza joints.  Try a green pepper, onion, and sausage.  This location does not have seating so be prepared to pickup or get delivery."}
{"text":"There was a paper clip in my pizza.  Enough said.  The service and quality of the food can vary from day of the week and location.  But almost choking on a paper clip kills it for me."}
{"text":"Mmm Mmm Mmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!! It's only 25$ for a one topping l, 18 inch Chicago Style pizza.  It is definitely good for the price and it's a good chain here in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Ordered 14\" thin crust monster pizza and lasagna. Pizza crust was greasy because they overloaded the pizza with meat toppings and cheese. Crust was undercooked as well. Lasagne was like none I have ever had before, but unfortunately, not in a good way. It was yellow in color and lacked any flavors resembling lasagne. We each ate a piece of pizza and a couple of bites of the lasagne and the rest went in the garbage. Worst $30 I've spent in a long time."}
{"text":"My girlfriends wanted pizza and delivery.  I had their flyer on my refrigerator for some time so my friend said \"lets order\". 

1. The veggie extra cheese pizza was cooked well and tasted great. We got wings too. Just OK wings.

2. Our order was delivered in 40 minutes.  Our food was hot... right out of the oven fresh.

3. The staff is friendly.  Our phone order person was peppy. Real friendly.  The delivery guy was all smiles and grateful for the big tip.

I woulda done 5 stars but the wings were kinda yuck."}
{"text":"This place is trash. If you willingly pay around $50 for two thin crust pizzas, you need to be mentally evaluated because you might qualify for disability.

I went to a birthday party and this was the pizza there. If you have nothing but thin crust pizza at a birthday party, I automatically hate you anyway. It's overpriced to the point where it should just be on the strip or Fremont. How could a place be so upscale pricewise but so white trash that it should come with a free sleeveless vintage Travis Tritt t-shirt and a Reba McIntyre t-shirt for your wife or stepdaughter?"}
{"text":"Always excellent pizza and excellent service!  I love the lunch pizza/salad bar!  Vegetables are cut into manageable sized pieces. Wait staff is helpful but not obtrusive.  Nice atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"it was good , I didn't like the soft Italian bread, I think that it should've been toasted. the spaghetti could of been seasoned more. but they're nice people and do a good job. I would go back , I've not had a thin crust pizza yet..I also didn't receive on delivery knifes n spoons or napkins. the Chicago dog wasn't worth the money , it was to small... ."}
{"text":"This Rosati's pizza lacked the quality I've had at other Rosati's pizza. They overcooked it and it had a slightly charred flavor to it, both times I went to this place. The customer service was poor both times because I felt rushed and the employees did not care to help me and seemed like they would rather be someplace else. I'm not saying all Rosati's are bad because I also frequent the Rosati's at 28th and Thunderbird, and it is fantastic compared to this one (Both in customer service and food)."}
{"text":"The most difficult experience I've ever had try to order a delivery pizza! Haggling over specials posted online,put on hold twice and still no resolution. Called back and stopped order within 2 minutes. Manager was \"ok like sorry man,it'll be 45 to an hour\". If it's too close to closing then close an hour earlier! Used to love this place--what happened"}
{"text":"This is the SALTIEST pizza we've ever eaten!!!!!  We'll order Little Ceasars before we get it from this place again.  Service was good though, and the pizzas were ready on time."}
{"text":"Don't use the Internet to order. You can't enter coupons and you will need coupons for it is expensive! Pizza was cold when it arrived :(. Customer service was not good either when I called the store."}
{"text":"I have been a customer sense the location opened and this is the first time I have gotten such bad service.  my take out order was completely wrong. When I called to inform them that the order was incorrect they told me all they could do is remake the pizza and that I would have to bring the pizza ( that had already had a slice removed) back and wait 30 min for them to make another. The girl behind the register told me that they can't give me a discount or any type if reimbursement for my troubles. This coming from a chain that has coupons attached to every pizza.  I waited for half an hour in there restaurant and they didn't offer me a soda and they were content that they might loose a good customer . Word to the wise they charged me .90 to put onions on half of the pizza that came with onions. I'm not sure what happened to the quality and service at this location but it sucks.  I am no longer spending money here. Ordered a classic combo and got a cheese pizza with half onions only."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Good portions..great price.  Ours was delivered and arrived hot.  Will recommend to anyone who will listen."}
{"text":"Walked into the store and ordered 14\" Deep Dish, Meatballs, two Cannoli and a can of Dr. Pepper. No other customers were there and the phone wasn't ringing off the hook from what I could tell. 

As I waited, I heard the register girl laughing in the back, \"They said they wanted to speak to the manager. I told them I WAS the manager. Ha ha ha.\" That should have been a red flag. 

The order was ready in a half hour and I took it to my car. I asked my wife to check for the Dr. Pepper. It was missing. SO I went in and got it. 

When we got home, we ate the pizza and meatballs. Both were good. But when we reached for dessert, we found out that they gave us cheese cake instead of cannoli. We were really looking forward to the cannolli. How hard is it to get an order right when nobody else is in the store? I may order pizza from them again but I'll make sure to check EVERYTHING. Can't stand incompetence or indifference."}
{"text":"First time ordering here and it was amazing! I've had Amore Taste of Chicago a few times, and I have to say the Chicago Style pizza is better here. The ranch is excellent as well. Will be ordering again! :-)"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!! I'm impressed.... I read the reviews and some were not so good and some were really good, but you guys only have 2 1/2 Stars. So I thought I would try it anyway. I asked the delivery driver what's up with the stars. She told me \" New owners. They are using the right ingredients now, so that's why we're getting better reviews. The old owners didn't use the right ingredients, just looked for whatever was cheap.\"  Well I'm glad I took a chance on you guys. Differently a winner and thank the lady driver for being honest and up from . I will diffently order from you guys again. I give you  5 stars"}
{"text":"I called in for pickup. My sister placed an easy one pizza order, which I listened to her explain  and the server repeat back to her on speaker. When we went there to pick it up, It had the wrong toppings. We were barely told sorry, nor was offered any discount or percent off the next time we place an order. We had to wait an extra 20 minutes after being told 10 minutes in order to have a new pizza created. This was not the first time this particular location has screwed up an order with me or said a certain time in which is took way longer.  They did not attempt to make it up to us or compensate us for the extra time needed to wait for them to give us the correct order."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. I usually just order a thin crust cheese pizza, but it tastes different everytime I order it (no joke either)! I like the mozzarella sticks though, and they always taste the same. I get vouchers from restaurant.com when eating here...you can get about half off that way."}
{"text":"this place has new owners and they are awesome! the change has worked out wonderfully. pizza is super and the management awesome! thank you for the great tasting pizza. wonderful job!!"}
{"text":"Had some folks over to the house last Friday evening where everyone was supposed to bring a dish. I ordered a 20\" Super Supreme and it was snorted down!

It's a thin crust pizza with lots of goodies on top: sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers, onions and black olivesI was hoping to have some leftover, so much for that idea.

We had 12 people here, everyone enjoyed it and asked where we got it."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and I have been to over half the Rosatis in Las Vegas.  There is serious inconsistency from place to place and I almost gave up hope for a decent Chicago style west of the Mississippi.   Look at the pics - this pizza is cooked perfectly and brought tears to my eyes.  FINALLY a place where Chicago style is done right!

The only thing was the onions were a bit on the raw side but it'll taste like heaven tomorrow morning for breakfast. 

Thank you wigwam Rosatis!"}
{"text":"I've only tried their chicago style pizza.  IT IS GOOD!  I am not FROM Chicago but I have been there and had chicago style pizza from several popular restaurants there.  Nothing is ever exactly the same as the city it originated from, but this is dang good pizza!  I recommend the meat lovers toppings. The cheese they use is top quality and the sauce tastes homemade.  I am trying to get a pic of the pizza to put on but we always forget and start eating before taking it!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EVER ORDER FROM HERE. CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS. Ordered to go and it never came. I called to see what happened to our order and the lady who answered the phone was rude. Don't even waste your time ordering from here. I would give this place a ZERO star."}
{"text":"Just literally spoke to a Samantha...called in a order with Holly ..she put me on hold the second she answers ,not letting me get a word in (hold for 4 min)/then it take over 40 min for delivery call to cancel,the driver still comes out,and i had to turn him away ,because i ment what i said about the cancellation. and ms manager samantha was all so okay with everything..been going here for years and the staff apparently seems to just be winging it.i will def find another Italian establishment."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on yelp my gf and I were a bit skeptical but decided to order the CHicago style pizza and some breadsticks. The pizza was incredible. The breadsticks were nothing to rave about but the pizza was great. We picked up and I have to say that I will order there again. Great pizza."}
{"text":"we ordered the deep dish pizza from this location. Should have known better after the gal on the phone said the ovens were not working correctly. Dough was not cooked in the center, nor was it cut correctly and had to be torn apart. Also cost like 30 bucks, and for that you can go somewhere and get  a good pizza. Will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Always delicious pizza! I don't care what anyone says. Went in here one night and left my phone. They went out of their way to get me my phone back to me. love Rosati's."}
{"text":"Well, I guess I have to up this review to four stars since I can't get enough of Rosati's Italian beef.  I have absolutely no idea how authentic it is, but since Rosati's is a Chicago-based chain, I'm guessing it's pretty close to the real deal.  Anyway, it's delicious, and the portions are extremely generous for what you pay (although the delivery charge still sucks).  

Also, thin crust pizza is the way to go here.  It's still pretty greasy, but not as bad as the thicker crusts.  The individual-size pizza is pretty big for just one person and at a good price."}
{"text":"awful pizza cheese sucks sauce sucks crust sucks disgusting bonless wings the worst i ve ever had hard and old...same with the fries ranch was runny and gross.. only thing ok was the coke lol anyways definitely wouldn't  ever eat there again anyone with any sort of standard for food and even pizza bc its kinda hard to mess up do not bother. pick up a frozen pizza it would be better :)"}
{"text":"I went into Rosati's last night in hopes of writing a nice review for them, but alas fair Montague, that will not be happening today.  Let me tell you my story....

I went in and ordered a Calzone with all meat now cheese.  You see I am lactose intolerant, and dairy will literally make me really sick.  I'm talking days on end in bed.  I paid for my food, which included a side of Garlic bread, and a soda, and sat patiently waiting for my food.  The garlic bread came out, and to be honest it was not good.  They used bread that seemed more stale than toasted and the sauce had a bit of a sour taste to it.  I ate it anyways, thinking that I was instore for a tasty Calzone, like so many times before.

The calzone came out and it looked like every other time I've been there, which has always been a treat.  I cut into it to make sure there was no cheese, a risk I am not willing to take, only to find that was cheese in there.  Now I'm a patient person, I took it back to the counter in hopes of have my food replaced...boy was I wrong.

The boy (and I do mean boy for he was just a lad) told me I never asked for no cheese, when I know for a fact that I did.  He then proceeded to argue with me about what I said and what he heard, never once saying that he would like to fix the problem and get me the food that I requested.  After a few minutes of this, I decided that I was not worth it, and I ask for a refund.

I only regret that I gave them a tip when I first ordered.  I guess good service is something choose not to have (along with stale bread, and sour sauce).  I at one point was ready to write them a killer review, talking about the joy of using Chicago style crust, but after getting treated the way I was treated, I would recommend not going there, and finding a better pizza/Italian food eatery, for if they screw up at Rosati's, it apparently is the customer's fault."}
{"text":"When staying at Fairmont Princess Hotel we order delivery to the pool. Our favorite meal of the trip. Make sure to try the Italian sausage and request spices on the crust.  Delivery is fast. Excellent pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was awful. I was expecting the same quality pizza I had in Chicago, and was severely disappointed. The sauce was bland, and our extra thin and crispy was soggy.  We wound up tossing the pizza in the dumpster."}
{"text":"Ordered a chx parm sandwich for lunch. 

I should have known when it was dead at noon. 

Two bites and in the bin. Sloppy gross red sauce. Old and overlooked chicken. On a burnt hamburger bun (store bought) for just under $7.  What a waste of money on some horrible food.  I should have gone with my gut which said gt pizza, now I'll never know because I'll never return."}
{"text":"Food is always great.  Give a little love to the waitstaff, though.  On one night, I was worried for the girl who took my order.  She made a mistake and I got the impression that mgmt. would not be pleased with her if she did the right thing by the customer.  She should have been able, at the very least (in my opinion) to give me 50% discount on the pizza only, if the error resulted in wasting half the pizza.  I didn't argue with the meager offer of 25%.  I remembered my niece's experiences while working there at one point and immediately related to the anxiety the staff was experiencing.  If you can tell the mgmt. when their staff is great, maybe this will help them forge better relations with their employees.  Obviously, if they enable their staff to give superior service, they will win more than loyal customers, they will gain happy and confident employees.  If I were the type of customer that demanded fairness and could not see the fear of the boss in this employee, things would have escalated and that would have been silly.  Silly because in a lot of restaurants they would simply buy the loyal customer the entire pizza!  Again, great food!!  I will make sure I do my part in the future and repeat my order a couple times to help out the busy and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Best pizza you will ever have!  My only complaint is that if you decide to actually go eat inside, like we did, it took about an hour to get our pizza!  I started to get a little pissed off with my screaming toddler pouring peppers everywhere an jumping all over the seats, but when the pizza gets to the table, everyone is super quiet with a mouth full of yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"My problem with this pizza is that it is too good. When I order, and I do often, I have to ask them to go easy on the sausage. Still, each and every bite has a bit of the most wonderful sausage you could ever want.
I am a Chicago native. I am always struggling with my weight, and this place does not help with that cause."}
{"text":"Place is out of control . Service staff fighting . Ordered my pizza for here and they just dumped it in the counter in a box to go . They encourage a rough Clientele . Goes further down every visit ! Can't handle any volume . Bartenders now swearing at folks"}
{"text":"Wow,  That pretty much sumed up the experience.  My wife and I ordered pizza and everything was great until we picked up our food.  We traveled home and the pizza smelled delightful.  We enjoyed a couple of slices and got to the center portion were there was clearly more cheese and a long black curly hair baked into the pie.  Needless to say we were finished and of course hungry,  however we had no appettite after seeing the hair baked in the cheeses.  I called and they offered to bring me another one, but after that we were done.  This is ironically the second pizza from Rosatis,  that we received within a couple of years and both pies were acquirded from different locations where there was hair in the depths of  chesiest middle portion of  the pie.  This kind of experience makes you never want to dine out or take out."}
{"text":"Just tried Rosati's pizza delivery for the first time. Really unimpressed. The base tastes like it has been defrosted, or stale. Each slice is ridiculously heavy. The tomato paste is really peppery, which the kids didn't like, and they really didn't like all the oregano sprinkled all over the pizzas - which we didn't know we were getting. We're ditching the bulk of our order. Won't go there or order from there again. Shame, we like supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"This place was nearby my house and I wanted to get a pizza...so there I went. Went inside and place was sorta busy. When I placed my order they said it was going to take 30 minutes or so for me to receive it....I literally looked around the dining room and asked why.??? They said they were busy.....I did say it was sorta busy right and did for a reason. I ordered anyway and sat down. I have some patience and I wasn't going to a bar just yet....give these guys a chance. Pizza came out about 35 minutes later and it looks pretty good. I ate a few slices and it was pretty tasty. The only thing that kept me from 4 stars was this.........
1. the wait....snore.....
2. I wish the pizza had more meat on it.....wheres the beef baby!!
3. when you bite into the pizza the lip scorching cheese flap comes off and blister the daylights out of you lips and chin....... I should've screamed in bloody horror! Consider this a warning and a public service announcement!
I ordered a small pizza and a drink and it was $18 bucks.......compared to pizza hut that's expensive and I get 2 pizzas from the hut!"}
{"text":"Tried Rosati's Pizza the other evening. We ordered a medium Cheese thin crust pizza. The delivery time was within reasonable limits. The delivery person was prompt and polite. The problem here is this is not the style of pizza we expected. The crust was advertised to be thin, and it was I guess, but hard and unappetizing. The bottom of the crust did not look to be hand tossed but had the appearance of some chain establishments. The cheese slid of the pie with first bite. The one bright spot here is the sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"We had the dough nuggets and a deep dish pizza. Both were delicious. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza twice in the past week from the Tempe branch of Rosati's and it was amazing. We had the first order delivered, and they were there when they said they would be. The second order we picked up ourselves, and it was ready and waiting. The staff were friendly, the place was clean and the pizza was delicious. If we lived around here we would definitely use Rosati's as our local pizzerria."}
{"text":"Got a nice dose of food poisoning last night from Rosati's meatball Cazlone. Still not quite \"right\" today. I will spare you the details.

I decided to call and let them know in a effort to perhaps save someone else. When I spoke to \"the manager\" she asked what I had, and said \"thanks for letting us know.\" Never an I'm sorry, can I give you a refund, and any hint of empathy.

She did say she would let the owner know, So I guess all are safe now. Beware!"}
{"text":"Tonight my wife ordered an x-large 1/2 pepperoni & 1/2 canadian bacon and pineapple for pick up. I picked it up and when I got it home and we took a look at it we were slightly stunned as there was very little pepperoni and zero canadian bacon! We even checked under the cheese to make sure. There was just sauce there. My wife called them and to be honest I think at first they thought she was lying to them. At first they said we needed to return it for \"quality control\" purposes and I indicated that I would be happy to do so. I also offered to take some photo's and send them. My wife wound up talking to the manager, I believe it was Andrew, and she explained the situation to him. She explained that we'd been visiting and ordering pizza from this specific Rosati's location for many years and that this was the first time ever that we'd had any sort of issue. Andrew understood the situation immediately and offered to replace our order and have it delivered to our door. 50 minutes later the replacement pie arrived and I have to say my faith was restored as it was hot and fresh and loaded just like every pie we'd ever had from there over the years. Five stars for the many excellent pies over the years and for Andrew's actions tonight. We tried another Rosati's location once and I can say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place took 50 minutes to get 1 pizza out. The pizza is very average and way over priced, don't waste your time eating in the service is garbage. Save your time and money and go with Barros definitely the best pizza around. It's not far either gray hawk is down the road."}
{"text":"Changed sausage on us. Pizza was terrible. Just kind of cheap tasting. Been eating at different rosati's for years. Not sure what happened. Cannot go back. Entertainment money is too tight to waste and/or risk."}
{"text":"We read the reviews for Rosatti & realize yelp is also a forum to complain as well as give positive feedback. After reading the complaints, we still gave the place a shot only because Our expectations for pizza delivery are not too high. 
We ordered delivery, when the food arrived, we were surprised. Everyone liked it and we will order delivery again.
The pizza came hot, neat, all toppings on the pizza.,( not like what one of the reviews said) The sauce was delicious. The pizza was exactly how we ordered it. And the pasta dish was good as well.
The delivery person was curtious and arrived exactly when they said they would.

{"text":"I am from Cali originally and never really had Chicago Style Pizza until this year. A good friend of mine is from Chicago and when he moved here we started trying different places. And I discovered Chicago-Style Food! 

Now typically, I love thin crust pizza, not big on even eating the crust unless its stuffed with cheese...however I was craving a ridic amount of cheese and marinara... So a friend and I decided to call in and place an order for Carry-Out...

We got a large Chicago-Style with Pepperoni, beef, and green peppers. We also ordered the combo platter appetizer. And who can forget the Cannoli!! 

When we brought the food home, it smelt delish! The pizza was huge and really delicious! It could have been a little hotter, they told us 35 for pick up and maybe we waited 45? Either way, it was really good! 

The app was great also, stuffed mushrooms and onion rings, mozzarella strips, jalape√±o poppers, and their ranch is very good! My faves were the onion rings and stuffed mushrooms, so good!

Another new thing for me? Cannoli! But since my first Cannoli a few months back, I've been trying them everywhere! This one was VERY good! Little bits of pistachios in the filling, yum!

I am pleased with the order we made, their timeliness.. And the food was great! I would definitely go back!


For those that state the wait is too long when visiting, read the menu thoroughly! Things are made to order and it clearly states \"please expect another 15 min for cooking\" or something along those lines! 
Quit bitching and slow down for dinner. It's not fast food!  ;)"}
{"text":"We were ecstatic that Rosati's east Scottsdale is back! Ordered a classic combo thin crust tonight (yeah, we love their deep dish, but weren't in the mood tonight). Plenty of real mozzarella and toppings. We also got penne pasta with Italian sausage. Rich tangy tomato sauce seasoned perfectly, with ample tasty sausage. Took about 40 minutes to arrive, when they promised 35 to 45 minutes--and everything was hot. We also love Streets of New York, but will definitely be splitting our business between the two depending on how we feel! Congrats on a great re-opening!"}
{"text":"Second try at this location. Ordered chicken parmigiana, lasagna and tiramisu for carry out. Lasagna did not have meat sauce as ordered, chicken parmigiana was not the pasta dish ordered but the sandwich and the chicken was burned and dry.  Tiramisu was good. When we tried to call to let them know about the errors, they placed me on hold and never got back on the line. It seems that staff try to make an attempt to be accommodating, but I would not order either dish again. Disappointing."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but great pizza.  The best sausage pizza we've ever had."}
{"text":"Never had Chicago style deep dish pizza before and wow!!! So good and the sauce is incredible. We had pepperoni, mushroom, black olive and spinach. The crust is chewy and good and cradles the cheese, toppings and sauce over the top. You gotta try it!!!"}
{"text":"Like Aaron P., I too ordered the 2-slice lunch special. These are advertised as 'JUMBO' slices by the way.  As you can see from the picture, it was the same deal - one slice of pizza cut in half.  When I politely complained to the server/bartender, she just smiled and said I could talk to the manager.  I said I would like to do that, to which she replied \"he's outside\".  When I received the bill, she again indicated that I had to chase the manager down to complain.  This is just a pathetic way of doing business.  I thought maybe this was an 'oops', but I'm not the only one this has happened to!  If you can't afford to give your customers 2 slices of pizza on the 2 slice special, maybe you should just throw in the towel #myrosatis."}
{"text":"This place is great - the real deal.  Nice people, good service, GREAT Chicago pizza!"}
{"text":"Oh well food was good.  We were at a hotel moving across the country.  Order came without cutlery or Napkins.  Sad but food was good, not great but good"}
{"text":"The food was good!! We didn't receive any silverware, napkins or dressing, with a salad I hate having to use my hands lol. Meatball sub was my favorite!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering here for YEARS from multiple locations. We live by this once now, so order from this location. Its always amazing! They are always consistent in their food quality. The delivery can some times take a while, but I am okay with that since I know its being made fresh. We usually order thin crust, but sandwich are good as well. Would highly recommend this place. I don't like deep dish from anywhere, so I can't speak to that. Their thin crust is amazing though. if you order a lot of toppings, it can get a little soggy, but if you ask for it a little well done, it solves the problem!"}
{"text":"Hello people I'm not one to write reviews but today has marked the second time since I've been to this Rosati's pizza and it has been a horrible experience. I ordered a pizza at 542PM and was told it would be ready in half hour. I am about half hour awayso I was there exactly 30 minutes marking 6:12 PM on my watch. I walked inside gave them my name and paid for my order. There was numerous people waiting around to get their food so I waited patiently for 10 minutes ,15 minutes went by 25 minutes went by still no signs of my order. Walked up to the counter and asked what was going on with my order? The girl at the counter went to the back came back a few seconds later and said that their printer had screwed up and the pizza will be ready in 20 minutes. All the other orders had been delayed as well.  Printer wasn't screwed up,they were busy and person that took the order inputed incorrectly.  ( i heard the cook tell the girl.) so my pizza had to be remade. Not comfortable with the response I requested my money back which they promptly returned to me.  Not once did someone apologize to me for being there for so long.  I am okay with waiting an hour for food but please be straightforward with your clients.  Meanwhile the whole time I was there girl's answering the phones were telling people that it was 30 minute wait time knowing that those times were in correct."}
{"text":"We ordered a Chicago Style Deep dish pizza from here tonight. I specified that the sausage topping should be according to company policy which states \"they are spaced a knuckle's length apart\". When I got the pizza home it just looked sparse on toppings. Yup IT WAS ! There was about 1/2 the required amount. I called the place and explained the problem. - Oh well I told the cook but I guess he didn't follow instructions. No offer to make it right!.

The crust was also skimpy and thin.

I have ordered this exact pie at the 1035 N Ellsworth Rd. Location on several occasions and was very satisfied. I'll just go the extra couple of miles and get a good pie in the future."}

Mango habanero .....mmmmm just perfect !!!!! Just ask Britney, our foodservice, for suggestions, and you won't go wrong........( and I've said it twice !!!)

Oh, and it's 60 cent wings on Tuesdays !!!!!

Happy eating !!!!"}

{"text":"Waited 1 1/2 hours for order to be delivered, yes that is 90 minutes. The order was wrong, the cookies were not fully cooked and when I called to speak with the manager that person was \"out\".

{"text":"Pizza sauce has an overwhelming tomato flavor, the crust was layered and has a cardboard like taste.  Customer service was none too great either.  Like some of the other diners stated, go get a Little Caesars and save $15."}
{"text":"Love the salad.  Always fresh crispy lettuce and tons of toppings and goodies!  And they don't skimp on the number of dressings.  They let you fully enjoy the salad without paying extra for dressings!  The deep dish pizza is to die for.  LOVE the Godfather. Haven't had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Like Mark said in his review, unfortunately the quality has become so unpredictable I can no longer call them for my pizza orders. Rosati's has other franchise locations that care about quality."}
{"text":"This place used to be good.  However, as other people have mentioned, ever since the new ownership the food quality and service has gone way downhill.  The last 3 times we have ordered delivery they got the order wrong.  Recently I ordered an italian beef with red sauce and cheese and green peppers as well as hot wings.  Instead I received plain chicken fingers and a plain italian beef.  When I called them back they said they would be sending a driver to pick up the incorrect food (seriously, you're going to take back food that you're just going to throw away anyway?) and that the reason the order was wrong was because there was a New Cook. And I received no apology.  (Rosati's are you for real?) Then it took them another hour and a half to send me the correct order.  Something about the italian beef tasted \"off\".  It had a weird taste and it gave me digestive problems later.  A few months ago, my sister-in-law ordered from here and they got her pizza wrong, then it took them 2 hours to bring her the correct pizza, and only because she called them back wondering what had happened.  So it took this place 3 hours to deliver the correct pizza.  When she asked what happened they told her they were short on drivers and had forgotten about her order.  They still charged her and no apologies.  Every other time we order pasta from here they end up getting the order wrong."}
{"text":"Best service! Rosi is amazing. We visited after my sons little league game. We were tired but hungry. 
Food was fresh, quick, hot and the beer was reallllly cold."}
{"text":"Found this pizza place on yelp and decided to give it a try. Definitely 5 stars! Pizza was perfect, nice and hot, very little grease, great taste, and small cut slices. Mozzarella sticks were good, salad was ok, needs something other than just iceberg lettuce but overall it all hit the spot! Will be getting this pizza more often! Peace"}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas, with the addition of a third free one as they were running a special, to be delivered.  The order was placed at 4:20 in the afternoon and we were told it would be here within the hour.  At 5:10 I called to check on the order.  A manager came on the line to explain that the store has a 14 yr. old computer system and our order never printed out and went back to the kitchen.  As a result, if we still wanted the pizzas, they would take another 30 minutes!  When told this, it dawned on us that the same thing happened the last time we ordered from here which was about 2 yr. ago.  Obviously, they have not fixed the problem.  The manager told us if we wanted the pizzas, he would not charge us.  Even though this was going to make us late for some plans we had, we decided to go ahead but pick up the pizzas instead of having them delivered.  The quality was adequate at best.  We had a 14\" stuffed pizza with sausage and mushrooms and a 14\" thin crust with pepperoni and mushrooms.  The free pizza was suppose to be pepperoni and came as cheese only.  They couldn't even get that right.  If we had had to pay for the two pizzas, the bill would have been $45.54, including $2 for delivery.  Way too expensive for what we got. We will not be doing business with Rosati's again.  If you do decide to try them, I suggest you call five minutes after placing your order to make sure it went through the system."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza last night from this location.  Things could have gone better...
The Good - It seems like they use fresh veggies and the cheese and sauce were very good.
The Bad - The pizza was overdone.  The crust was burnt and chewy.  We had ordered their Pepperoni pizza with sausage on half and double cheese over it all.  We never did find any sausage!  LOL
The Ugly - We were told that it would be an hour before they could get the pizza to us.  Okay, that seemed like a long time, but we were trying to find a new pizza place and had never ordered from Rosati's before, so maybe that was their standard time.  A little over an hour later, the store called, stating the delivery driver had 'given' our pizza away and that they had to re-make it.  Bottom line, another half hour.  45 minutes later, I called to find out where our pizza was, and the young man who told me he was the manager stated it was out the door already and to expect the driver momentarily.  I called back 45 minutes AFTER that conversation to find out where our pizza was.  Some kind lady stated that our pizza was no charge and that she was offering us a $25 credit for the next time (of which there will be none, of course).  As we were on the phone, the delivery person showed up with our rather cold pizza and went on our way.

We will not order from Rosati's again, not from this location, and judging from other reviewers, not from any of the locations.  Wonder how they stay in business??"}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good. The deep dish has always been junk but the thin crust za, ribs and beef sandwich kept me ordering. They stopped serving the ribs. Disappointing but I guess the new owners didn't think it was economical. Last 3 orders were delivered with incorrect ingredients/toppings but I tried to give them one more try tonight. The order taker couldn't figure out what I meant when I ordered a dry beef with au jus on the side. After 3 or 4 mins of miscommunication I knew the order would be messed up again. I decided to abort the  mission and delete them from my delivery contact list. Too bad.....  really miss the ribs......"}
{"text":"Family hungry. Ordered a meatball sub for my 11 year old son. Heh heh.  Spaghetti and a salad for my wife and daughter to share. A, \"Chief,\" for myself, total only $33 plus tip for delivery. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  We got like 25lbs of food.  We were so stuffed and had so many leftovers, it's like a crime scene in my fridge. Best tasting Italian food in Chandler.  Previously just stuck to jumbo pizzas to feed a crowd, and they are also great. Order away with confidence."}
{"text":"Wow.   Terribly disappointed.    Pizza was cold.  Sauce was tasteless.  Had veggie pizza and spinach/tomato bread.  Bland.   Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have ever had.  Wonderful restaurant and service was great.

{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by our hotel. I ordered lasagna and Cesaer salad. The lasagna was excellent. Traditional taste and I chose the meat sauce. The sauce was delicious. Very homemade tasting. The lasagna was a very large portion, enough for two. I could not eat it all. Others in our group ordered pizza and everyone said it was good. They also have gluten free crust but you have to request. Atmosphere is very casual."}
{"text":"Best deep dish outside of Chicago, hand tossed isn't that great. Don't order from here through Grubhub, their menu is wrong and messed up my order. Call the restaurant directly or go to their site online."}
{"text":"I'll judge Rosati's by what they claim to be: an \"Authentic Chicago\" restaurant featuring pizza, italian beef, and hot dogs. I think they did a very mediocre impression of Chicago's classic food. 

The thin crust pizza was my favorite: pretty crunchy crust with flavorful sauce and enough cheese (nothing too much but it was at least more than a national chain like Papa Johns. The toppings weren't as plentiful as I'd like. Each slice had two or three pepperoni pieces with a couple sausage bits. I thought the taste reminded me of a Chicago thin crust pizza but was not up to its level. 

For the Italian beef, it was not comparable at all. Very below-average. Flavorless without copious amounts of either Au jus or giardiniera. The french roll was too soft and had no exterior crisp to it. 

The prices are a tad high, but for a place that calls itself a specialty restaurant they are what you'd expect. Service is pretty fast and friendly. Overall three stars sums it up: Mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is slow and the pizza sucks.
I think it just might be this particular location, though, because I used to go to another one in chandler by where I used to work and it was amazing.

So my boyfriend and I ordered a SMALL pizza and one order of bread sticks. I called in my order and she said it would be ready in an hour. And hour? For a small pizza and bread sticks? Okay, well they probably make it from scratch so we'll be patient. 5 minutes after I ordered, the girl called me back and said they were out of bread sticks. Out? How are you out? Can't you make more? She offered garlic bread instead. Alright, I guess.

An HOUR later, our food arrives.
The garlic bread was hard as a rock and tiny.
The pizza dough was under-cooked and tasted like crap.
Super expensive($32 with tip) and poor quality. Rosati's needs to look at this location because every other one I've been to was much better."}
{"text":"Love Rosati's... Staff is always friendly and helpful. My pizzas turned out Gr8!!!
 Thank you AMBER!!!"}
{"text":"Garbage. My wife and I ordered some food to be delivered. To start things off the man who dropped the food off at our door didn't have any change so he could get a better tip.  They will try and rip the money out of your pocket every chance they get. Including a $15 min and an additional delivery charge. The shrimp in the shrimp alfredo was way under cooked. On top of that the pasta tasted awful. If a blind man had cooked it using only what he guessed might be the correct ingredients it would have been worlds better. Not to mention it would have saved me my whole bankroll. No joke they charge you through the ass for food that would be better if it were cooked in an easy bake oven. If you want good food at a reasonable price screw this place because they blow monkey nuts."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Rosatis for a long time.  I had a very bad experience when I picked up a pizza from the Rosatis at Wigwam and Pecos (they are currently moving and restaurant is under construction...I believe Rosatis Cheyenne is under same ownership).  They overcharged me and front house management was rude when I brought it to their attention.  I then brought this experience to the attention of the general manager and she responded with a very sincere apology email along with a discount on my next meal, which I used today.  The thin crust pizza was awesome and chicken wings were delicious!  The order was perfect this time and I appreciate them making it right.  The manager and assistant at the Rosatis Cheyenne location were very kind and personable as well."}
{"text":"You know you love the place and eat it often when you can redeem the restaurant's free pizza deal for every 12 you order.  That's us.  This is the best pizza delivery in the Southwest part of Vegas.  Their thin crust pizza cut into squares is hands down one of the best thin crust pizzas in town.  Their delivery has always been quick and on-time, and last night it was still so hot that we burnt our mouths.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings are wonderful.  My husband is a mid-west Ohio boy raised on good thin crust pizza and he LOVES this place.  Without the solid delivery service I'm not sure we would order it so much, but you know the sayin, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\""}
{"text":"I'm doing two because the guy I talked to was nice and the driver as well. However this pizza. Not to great. It arrived lukewarm at best. I live less the a mile away. I asked for the meat to be separate (ordered a half and half), first bite, got a bite of meat. fed it to my dogs. They didn't like it. Soooo I donno..."}
{"text":"I can't even give this business a 1 star even if I was feeling extra nice, but yelp forces you to at least give a one star so Rosati's on Power and Thomas can thank yelp for that one star. I am from the Chicago area and this place wouldn't survive a day in Chicago with the horrible food and customer service. I don't know who owns this business, but they should be ashamed of the people that represent them. Our order was screwed up once before and this time I drove 15 minutes from my own home to find that nothing changed. I asked for BAKED mostaccioli. I get there and all that was there was meat sauce and noodles and there is supposed to be cheese and when I ordered I even asked for the cheese to be well done and if she hadn't been in such a rush to take my order and talk over me she might have actually heard what I said. This is what happens when you hire children to run your business. The same girl who screwed up my order the first time did it again on 1/8/13. Then when I walk back into the place the manager who looks and acts like he is all of twelve years old says are you here to pick upand I told him what happened, what I actually ordered and that I wanted my money back and he cancels my transaction and to this date the money still hasn't been returned to my account. He never offered to fix the situation or do anything to try and at least make it somewhat better. I would never tell anyone to go to this establishment ever!!!! By the way the lasagna my daughter had was disgusting too and that was the only thing that wasn't screwed up!!!"}
{"text":"I gave one star because I had to.  This was one of the worst experiences ever!! We ordered food which was almost a hour late. Then the order was wrong. Courtney the young lady who answered the phone told us that there is no way to prove we ordered it a different way. Not very good customer service if you ask me. Oh! And the manager was busy and refused to come to the phone to try and help. I am extremely offended at the fact they basically called me a liar and said that we ordered our food wrong that they didn't get it wrong. Very rude, unfriendly service. Beware before you order delivery here. I will make sure to tell everyone I know to not go here."}
{"text":"I heard about Rosati's Pizza from a coworker and decided to order a pizza for my Friday movie night. I got a 12'' thin crust with mushrooms. I was very disappointed with the pizza. The crust was very hard and flavorless. The sauce also was flavorless. I had to put on my own seasonings to make it edible. It honestly tasted like a frozen pizza. I've had better pizzas at Costco. I am not sure if I ordered the wrong kind of pizza, since I've read such good reviews, or if I am just a pizza snob. Regardless, I hesitate trying this place again."}
{"text":"We love Rosati's Pizza the flavor the crust delicious. They cut their Pizza in squares instead of pie shaped wedges. The crust is always crispy and never soggy. The flavor of their sauce sausage and other ingredients is a flavor orgasm. Love their Pizza and they are fast the order is placed and within 20 to 25 minutes you can pick up your pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! We were staying at a hotel near the airport, no transportation and used Yelp to find a nearby pizza place that would deliver.  Delivery was prompt, pizza was hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here fairly regularly for years and have typically ordered the deep dish pizzas. The quality of the deep dish when they get it right is excellent.  This would be expected when you drop $25 for a pizza.

However getting the deep dish crust done right consistently is something this place struggles with.  On a recent order I called them back after the crust sounded and felt like hard candy when my wife and I bit into it.  This is after recent orders that have been less than great quality wise, but okay.  

I was trying to explain to the younger sounding lady that said she was a manager my concerns but was repeatedly interrupted.  She wanted to explain their cooking process, which was over my head.  She insinuated they made no error and the pizza was cooked correctly.  Not the kind of a response one would expect for a long term customer when you contact them for the chance to make it right.  To be fair their customer service had been generally good with other staff.  

It's just not worth the hassle or risk of feeling you overpaid for an inferior pizza.  There are other options around that are consistently better."}
{"text":"Was a loyal customer but the $2 per topping on a 14 in pizza is ridiculous and being on hold for 18 minutes is a deal breaker. Quality of product nothing like Chicago nor is the service."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Ramada Inn Urbana, Illinois and couldn't go out to eat.  Called Rosati's and ordered the Rosati's Monster,  thin crust.  Awesome pizza. One of the best pizzas we have had ever.  A small feeds two easily, the toppings are piled on but don't overpower the sauce or the crisp crust. Wish we had them in Minnesota!"}
{"text":"very accommodating to huge family thank you Rosati's this has been a great experience especially during the holiday time I appreciate your customer service and you are friendly patient staff manager was John Langley thank you from Cali"}
{"text":"Great fast delivery service! The deep dish pizza is amazing! 
Definately the right Rosatis to order from!"}
{"text":"OMG sat in restaurant and waited forever to get a server..hopefully the food is better than the wait"}
{"text":"Excellent Calzones. Huge, could easily be 2 meals or shared. Delivered right to hotel door. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! First time getting food from here as I'm not from the area... but ordered two pops, only received one so giving it 4 stars.. not going to complain it was only 1.50, the pizza was delicious along with the deep fried shrooms ... drool."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I absolutely love the pizza. My biggest issue with them is the fact that they can't get their orders straight. Their chicken fingers are great, however too spicy for my children. We have on more than one occasion ordered the sauce on the side for the chicken fingers and they forget every time!  After waiting over an hour for delivery, the last thing I want to do is have to prepare more food for my kids..."}
{"text":"I was delighted to discover a Rosati's existed in the C-U area since I grew up eating it! I can hand's down say this is the best pizza in the C-U area! I've always had good customer service when I've been there, so it may be a hit or miss situation! The last time I went I got a thin crust pizza and cheesy garlic bread--the garlic bread was a sub roll with baked cheese on top, so my advice is to stick with pizza or other simple apps like fries. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've had Rosati's in Chicago and always thought they were a decent pizza, certainly not top 10, but good for a change of pace from the typical places.

I stopped by this location since it was near my hotel and I learned they also served Italian Beef sammies, which are hard to find outside the Chicago area -- so they were getting my business after a 12 hour, no lunch work day.

Since I had to get an Italian Beef, I also got a thin crust personal pizza (it was my first meal all day, don't judge me!) , in hopes that their thin crust was better than my memories of their deep dish back in Chicago.

Unfortunately, while the Italian Beef was much better than expected, the Pizza was not. It wasn't bad, it was just bland and reminded me much like a kit pizza you would get at a bowling alley."}
{"text":"From the moment I called to place my order till the moment I walked out the door with my food in hand did I receive wonderful customer service. First of, being a newbie, I wasn't really sure what to order but the girl on the phone was so helpful. I felt like her suggestions were convenient for me & not just for the business. I was informed that I could view the menu on-line or she could go over it with me. She pretty much described the whole menu including the different pizzas they offer. (they have 3 different crusts).
Upon arrival I was greeted not only with a hello but with a smile. Come to find out the girl @ counter is a Chicago native. We spoke a few mins on that while I waited on my order. I ended up ordering thin crust which was amazing. Next time I'll try Chicago style!"}
{"text":"Once again we had amazing experience with Rosati the people who work there are amazing and Mickey over the top sweet and kind the delivery guy was just as good and the pizza was amazing we will tell our family and friends  thank you guys  for your service and amazing pizza Leesa Barton"}
{"text":"I love this place.  We order pizza from here about twice a month.  9 times out of 10 the food is good, but sometimes its a little overcooked and dry.  This seems to be happening more lately...maybe its just a fluke.  Ive been going there for so long I know they put out a great product, but I think sometimes the cooks just get lazy.  They also have great chicago style hot dogs (with the poppy seed buns and vienna beef dogs).  And the girls up front are super friendly - especially Kylie."}
{"text":"The tomato sauce is the thing that makes pizza at Rosanti's great! Not to acidic, not to bland, just perfect for my taste. 

There was some confusion about my order and I ended up waiting an extra 20 minutes--I was very hungry and so the initial news about having to wait extra time did not sit well with me at first. After a bad day, I realized I was visiting Rosanti's for their sauce and I decided not to let this confusion bother me. I was understanding and the staff was very accommodating and offered an apology and a sizable discount I couldn't refused. I was willing to pay full price despite the extra wait, but the staff went above and beyond and promptly remade my pizza and provided phenomenal service. I came to Rosanti's for the food but I walked away with an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Went to get wings which was probably the worst idea in the world they where bland as heck,small,and just down right not good..honestly I wouldn't waste my time there again..notice there was a Wingstop next door and decided to check it out the next day and it was fabulous...basically this place sucks ass if your going pay for wings choose Wingstop"}
{"text":"Rosati's missed the mark tonight. I placed my order online and ETA was 60 mins. At 1 hour 10 mins I called to get the ETA, and was told it would arrive in 5 more minutes. We received a very cold and over cooked pizza."}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to try another location (Sarasota) to appreciate your own local store... I love this location, helpful, friendly, and the deep dish is heaven... Keep it up guys some of your colleagues can't come close to the store on Ray."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location.  

The owner is a liar and rude.

Ordered from this location and it was such a terrible experience they offered to replace my order the next time.

I called to order the replacement order and the owner literally told me I was a liar and just trying to get free pizza.  No wonder this place has bad reviews.  The owner runs a joke of an establishment

Go to the one on Waddell.  The owner isn't an uneducated prick there."}
{"text":"A cute little italian resturant that was quite tasty and inexpensive!! I had orderd the cheese ravioli and it was amazinf for $7 you got a huge plate and a delicious bread stick as well!! I will probably never order the pizza as for the price is  a little spendy but will definitley order the ravs again!"}
{"text":"Tonight we had a party of 8.  Our food took forever.  It came at various times instead of all at once.  Other dinner guest were getting their food before we all did.  Along with the people with carryout.  Some of the food was cold and had to be sent back.  Even that took awhile to come back out. We and other patrons dining in had to replenish their own drinks.  I had an Italian sub.  There was hardly any meat & what meat there was, was cut super thin.  There was LOTS of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers & dressing.  I will NOT be going there again."}
{"text":"Awesome large pizza with canadian bacon and mushrooms. Yummy chicken fingers. Great service great food..."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this Rosatis since they opened.  Being from Chicago this is the type of pizza I grew up on.  I think their sausage is the best!  My only beef is sometimes the pizza is delivered a little on the cold side."}
{"text":"A little pricey compared to its competitors, but they make a mean crust. Very friendly staff, very consistent pizza, very tasty:) I Recommend rosatis pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered a stuffed pizza with sausage and spinach. The pizza was only 1/2\" thick and had maybe 10 pieces of sausage in the entire large pizza. Waste of $30. Rosati's is good, but pick another location. This is not the first time this location has disappointed."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  I LOVE Rosatis and I have had enjoyed their pizza  from many locations before having one from this one.  I recently moved here and ordered a pizza for delivery (my first and last time) and I honestly thought he handed me an empty box!  The pizza crust was the thinnest I have ever seen, the sauce tasted like Ragu and they must have sprinkled the meager amount of cheese on it through a salt shaker. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.  It amazes me that corporate has not pulled this shame of a franchise."}
{"text":"I love the pizza and the Rosati's salad with creamy italian dressing. The deep dish is a REAL deep dish and tastes wonderful. With that said I ordered the Rosati's salad and was given the garden salad with the wrong dressing which would have been if I just wanted a plain side salad but what I wanted was the Rosati's salad as my meal. I also ordered the tiramisu with high hopes and discovered its a small slice pre-made, pre-packaged, tiramisu. I ordered looking at the menu online (http://www.myrosatis.com/menu/store/default.asp?locationId=127) so when I ordered the tiramisu I thought I was going to get $4.95 worth but when the food was delivered I realized on the receipt its only $2.95. So its annoying their website isn't updated. Overall I will keep ordering them but will double check my orders and clarify what I'm ordering when its over the phone."}
{"text":"My husband is from Illinois.  We have been married 23 years and for all of these years I have had to listen to him pine for \"Chicago-style pizza\".  I was never very sympathetic until I finally went to Chicago and had Giordanno's.  Wow.  As soon as I returned to Henderson, I started looking for my hubby's holy grail.  What a surprise to find this place - and so close to home!  AND they deliver!

The Monster is our favorite- sausage, pepperoni, bacon, ground beef, mushroom, onion, green pepper, tomatoes, green and black olives.  We add anchovies so there's enough of a salt flavor - LOL!  The teens love the pepperoni.  They offer several kinds of crusts - thin, double dough, chicago style, super stuffed and pan - BUT the Chicago style is our choice.

This is no Little Caesar's - the tab can get up there - but the pies are huge as well as deep.  A small can satisfy my husband and myself whereas a large from somewhere else usually is required.

The place itself is a mere hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall.  I think most people order takeout or delivery.  But there are a few small tables and a t.v. which is usually tuned to a game.  Not much ambiance, at all.  But, oh, the Chicago style pizza!  Heaven.  Their menu includes other choices like pasta and Italian dinners, wings, burgers, etc.  I haven't tried anything other than their pizza.

A note regarding ordering other styles of crust besides Chicago - unless you specify, they will cut the pie into tiny squares.  For us, that is not a very satisfying piece of pizza.  I am not sure why they do that, but that is my only complaint about this place."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online and had a good experience. Food showed up earlier than expected. I had the beef and wings and thought they were above average. I believe this beef is better than Portillos."}
{"text":"Took me 1 hour to get a fish sandwich(they told me it would only take 20 minutes) ridiculous!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never again.  I was so excited to see they reopened only to be very sadly disappointed...ordered carry out by phone and sat for another 40 min after my order was supposed to be ready.  Bill came to $75 for two 16 inch pizzas and wings..are you nuts?  This is pizza!  I complained and they added some coupon discount and I waited as a hostage for my pizza 40 min later.  Girls in the front seemed to just stand around. Then the guy tries to give me just the pizza without the wings.  I get the pizza home and it's NOT what it used to be.  Pizza was cold..not sure what i was waiting on then.  The wings were fried to the bone.  Never going back and it's not going to last in this economy!"}
{"text":"Very snippy and snotty woman on the phone. Told they would take an hour to deliver. She said it was very loud in there and she couldn't hear me so she read my credit card back to me in a loud voice. When I asked her if people were there to hear she said no. So I guess these were ghosts that were making loud background noises? When I called back to cancel a moment later, I got another woman and told her my complaint and I got no apology...only her complaint that she had to \"run back and tell the kitchen.\" Last time I ordered from another store by accident, as we were new here, and they took my order, then after a half hour called to say it was the wrong store I called and they couldn't deliver. The manager did offer some freebie in the future but that did not help our hungry stomachs that night. Highly unrecommended."}
{"text":"The food is absoutly delish. True Chicago style food.we get the deep dish Chicago pie."}
{"text":"I came here for the Italian Beef Sandwich. The Flavor and Taste was excellent. If this is something you crave from Chi Town, you wont go wrong. I have not tried the Pizza yet."}

{"text":"I have given this place so so many changes ...they have no time line what so ever... Never busy yet dirty dishes everwhere I'm done with them I suggest pizza my dear instead they will amaze you"}
{"text":"Tried Rosati's for the first time after buying a Groupon there.  We ordered a tray house salad and a small Chicago pizza.  The tray salad was HUGE and would feed a large family.  All was great, great customer service.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We love Rozatti's I will drive 15 miles all the way to Urbana sometimes just to get a slice for lunch. I wish they served beer there, we would eat dinner there more often if they did. I don't need to drink tons of beer but I like it with pizza, for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is always filthy. The prices are way too high ($13 for 1 serving of lasagna ) I ordered a meatball sub and after finding not 1 but 2 hairs I threw it away. $9 gone......STAY AWAY FROM HERE!"}
{"text":"Terrible service... First off started by ordering over the phone a pick up for pizza and wings... Had done so a few times over the past for delivery and   had no problems with their sandwiches and the service was decent enough to consider okay... Clearly was not trying to get anything for free seeing as I called simply as courtesy call letting them know to cook the pizza slightly longer.. its also so close to me about a block away.. the pizza was not done at all the middle was extremely doughy and probably needed to be in the oven for just over another 5 minutes. The person I asked to talk to was apparently the manager or supposedly I should say. Really wondering who trained him because basically argued with me over five minutes  without hearing anything I had to say. conversation on his end was clearly unintelligent.. Felt like I was talking to a child throwing a fit to get his way with no argument. Again wasn't trying to get anything for free was just stating the fact that their pizza was not done... In the midst of a general manager: arguing with me I decided to end the conversation with a\" I will no longer ever order a single thing from this restaurant again \"and he was okay with it!!!...  For them it sucks.. Try Cafe la bellitalia or portabella"}

The person who answered the phone was more than accommodating when I asked for the breadsticks to have extra garlic butter on top and a side of Parmesan but guess what? None of it was included. I have came here before for fries and pizza and they were decent at best. Won't be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Dine in or Take out at this location. Hailing from Chicagoland, these folks certainly know how to make a great pizza, however you like it: thin crust, pan or stuffed. They also have salads, sandwiches, calzones, wings, beer & wine. There are two different franchisees of Rosati's in Metro Phoenix, you might like the style of one better than the other (plus menu, coupons and locations are different too)."}
{"text":"This pizza is good to get if you have a big group and you don't want to spend too much money on a more high end pizza. 
The pizza has a thin crust, but the crust isn't delicious, which is disappointing, since I love the crusts of pizzas. The flavors are mediocre, and I've never ordered this pizza myself before."}
{"text":"I have eaten deep dish pizza from another location, which was very good. Tonight I used Grub Hub to order from my local store. I ordered four items. Two of the items were inedible and I have thrown them away. The fettuccini with meat sauce and meatballs, and the Dough Nuggets with Marinara were so poorly prepared and tasting that I do not understand why they bother. The fettuccini was flavorless and very, very over cooked. The \"meat\" in the meatballs and meat sauce was loaded with filler and had a lot of water content, making the taste and texture horrid. I bought a salad to eat for my lunch tomorrow. I requested ranch dressing, but received Italian. I requested no Asiago on my salad, but it was there anyway. I will not be back to this location ever. Overpriced, inaccurate, and very unpleasant textures and flavors. My money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I eat delivery from Rosati's 2-3 times per week. They are always prompt, food is hot, and the normal delivery driver Michelle is very friendly. I typically order sandwiches. Their food is delicious. Only once did I get a sandwich with some burned cheese. The only complaint I have about their delivery (I've never eaten in the restaurant) is that they need a little more care invested in the packing of the orders. 

Other than small complaints, this place has solid food. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ok... Wow... What can I say, this place messed me up! (In a good way) The food blew my mind! I had the thin crust pizza and a hot dog Chicago style. It tasted just like I was back home in Chicago! Even if you are not from there I know you will enjoy this place. Oh and the service was great! One thing you should know, the dinning area is not large so you may want to try their carry out or delivery."}
{"text":"They have a great greek salad!!  I thought their pizza was okay...but the 4 stars are solely for the salad.  My husband, daughter and myself order one fairly often and split it three ways for dinner.  

We always get it to go, and my husband is usually the one that goes inside, so I have no clue about the service."}
{"text":"With Papa Del's having dropped the ball the last few years, and Garcia's just a memory on the far west side, my new go-to joint for pizza is Rosati's. With consistently tasty and (pay attention here, Papa Del's) perfectly cooked pizza, Rosati's is the new C-U standard for za. The calzones are awesome as well. I order the italian beef and onion and haven't been disappointed - generous ingredients with melted mozz oozing out. Their marinara is tasty, albeit just a little thin. My daughter ordered boneless chicken and it was also good. Maybe fried just a bit too hot since the breading is on the crunchy side, but real blue cheese dressing on the side  (nice chunks of b.c.), instead of cheap salad dressing like a lot of places. There are many other menu offerings - burgers, salads, bbq beef, spaghetti, etc. - but as far as pizza goes, Rosati's is second to none in C-U."}
{"text":"I recently moved out here, and I'm used to really good pizza from a local business back in New Mexico, but Rosati's pizza blows the best from my home state out of the water for roughly the same price. Try the Chicago, or super stuffed crust, you wont be disappointed because you get to pick the toppings. Plus a lot of really cute girls work there. my only wish is that they had green chili as a topping, but that's my own problem!"}
{"text":"This location hires people to hand deliver their flyers door to door who DONT know what NO SOLICITORS means!!! 
A flyer was left on my front door right next to the sign that says NO SOLICITORS,
Probably a smart asp kid, but Rosati's please train your flyer deliverers..."}
{"text":"When we first walked in we were surprised to find that it is a pick your pizza up and go home kind of shop. It was our first time so we asked Felipe, the employee up front, a few questions. He was short and not very friendly with his responses. We decided on our favorite, pepperoni and pineapple, on their double crust. Felipe described it similar to Dominos. I should have walked out the door then because I don't like Dominos pizza. The menu says double crust is a little thicker than the thin crust. We found a coupon online for a free pasta so we added a spaghetti to the order. We paid and he said it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.  As I was sitting in the lobby, I could see a small tv on a table in the back kitchen area. An employee walked over and turned the tv, made me question how sanitary it was back there. After tasting our pizza, I would compare it to a frozen pizza from the grocery. I was so disappointed. I really did not like their sauce. It was thick, clumped in various places of the pizza and weird tasting. The crust was dense and flavorless. The cheese was fine but they could have been more generous with the toppings. My husband hasn't tried the spaghetti yet, but I won't be trying it as I'm sure the sauce is the same as the pizza sauce. I won't go back there. If I want mediocre pizza, I can go to Little caesars for 1/3 of the price."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite location and their Chicago style dee dish pizza is the best around!  If you've never eaten at this location I truly recommend trying them out! The owner is awesome and fun to talk with."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Ordered lunch for my staff online and received confirmation email. They conveniently received payment, but not the order. 1.5 hrs later we received our food. There were no apologies and when I was told I would have a manager call me it NEVER happened. For my troubles, I was credited back $5."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked here at 9pm on a Thursday night for a slice of pizza. Although the 'Pizza by the Slice' sign was lit up in the window, they apparently don't serve slices of pizza past 8pm. Very misleading and very disappointed. Try Manolo's down the street instead!"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the deep dish pizza and it was awesome. I also had wings, breadsticks, and the chocolate cake. It was all hot, fresh, and prepared quickly and the young staff was very on the ball. When I came I was promptly greeted by them. They handed me what must be their new menu because it was the same one I had recently received at home. The food came and I was on my way home after getting a thank you and have a great weekend from them. I highly recommend this location and their food."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza last night at 6:10 pm.  at 6:38 my husband was at the counter and they had no order for us.  They checked my name, his name, our last name and phone numbers.  The girl insisted I must have called the wrong location by accident.  Husband calls me, Rosati site still on my computer screen.  Nope I called the right place.  I screen shot the call log and sent to him.  They offered to make a pizza for us if he'd like to wait for it.  Since the entire tone of the conversation was we were wrong and didn't order he declined the offer.

Fast forward to 7:54 p.m. as I'm just sitting down to the dinner I had to cook.  A girl from Rosatis calls wanting to know if I'm going to pick up my pizza.  I explain we already tried to pick up the pizza and she said \"no you didn't\"  REALLY!  The conversation went around a minute with her insisting we never showed up and I asked her if I needed to talk to the manger and she said yes I did.  

Scott the manager gets on the phone.  He too insists I'm wrong and had my husband come to the store and if there had been an issue he would have been notified to handle it.  REALLY so I'm a liar again.  He suggested my husband went to the wrong location or did he even know it was Rosatis I ordered from?  Here I started to loose my cool and offered that my husband is a 50 something competent professional that runs a multi million dollar business.  I think he can find his way into the local pizza establishment to pick up a pizza without getting confused.

The manager insists that we are wrong and didn't show up etc etc.  He asked what the person at the counter looked like when my husband came in for the pizza.  Wow, here's a trick question to show I'm lying.  I asked my husband who gave a brief description and angrily asked why I am still talking to this person as my end of the conversation was definitely telling him I'm being unreasonably harassed.  The manager would also like to know what time my husband came in so he can check his video (this should scare my because I'm lying right?) His employees say it didn't happen and he wants to get to the bottom of it.  That was easy to answer since my husband called me from there to ask if I called that location when I ordered.

After 11 minutes on the phone with the manager he said he would check the tapes and call me back.  I hung up, scraped my cold dinner in the trash and tried to calm down.  I have never been treated so poorly by someone who should wish to have my business.  It felt like I'd just been  interrogated and it was all very accusatory.  Everybody at Rosatis is right and I'm wrong or lying!  REALLY!!

42 minutes later Scott calls me back very apologetic saying someone fitting my husbands description did come in and leave without a pizza.  The employee at the counter would be reprimanded and he hopes we will give them another try and he will put a credit on our account for our next order.  He tried to explain that they do get prank orders and he was trying not to \"take sides\" between us and his employees.  

Here's my advise to Rosatis (Scott).  Take sides!!  I'm the customer and customer service counts for something.  If a customer says they tried to pick up a pizza and they sound like a 50 something well spoken professional and not a high school prankster perhaps you should apologize for the confusion and  a) after said apology ask if I could tell you some information so you can get to the bottom of this with your staff or  b) offer to deliver a fresh pizza which I would have declined as I'd already cooked dinner but would have shown customer service matters to you.

As far as a credit on my account for a free pizza.  No thank you!  This whole business from start to finish lasted 2.5 hours and was very upsetting.  I would rather throw my phone down and stomp on it then ever dial that number again.  HORRIBLE customer service!

I would not have posted this review had I not seen that it appears this location has ongoing problems and this isn't an isolated incident."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Rosati's and I was impressed with  great deep dish pizza. It might not be exactly Chicago style deep dish but the ingredients were excellent and I would definitely get this pizza again."}
{"text":"Thanks again for your delicious meals always satisfy the best of luck the best way great customer service love Rosati"}
{"text":"I have not been here, in a few months, because I moved a little further away... and I was really jonesin', last night. 
I am from Chicago, and Rosati's is my FAVORITE pizza ever.  
This used to be my favorite location - they're under new management and they have changed the recipe. The cheese congealed, the sausage was rubbery, the crust was lackluster, and the sauce was just kinda meh. 
I am so disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Good good and good I literally ate this pizza for 2 days the night I got it and the day after I had ordered the two medium pizza deal, thin crust deep dish with extra sauce and I kept coming back for more it took any 45min for them to deliver it was Worth the wait next time I'm gonna have to try some toppings on there like some pine apples, this time I only had cheese with the extra sauce, I sure will be ordering again , which will be on super bowl Sunday"}
{"text":"This pizza tastes good, only when it's cut into triangles ! When they chop
It in squares , it takes away from crust in every slice ! You have to specifically tell them
To cut your pizza in triangles if you want the full
Flavor!"}
{"text":"There are TWO DIFFERENT Rosatis Pizzas....DONT BE FOOLED!

Im a Chicagoan.  I ran a pizzaria.  I LOVE Rosatis and have been to at least a dozen different locations in both AZ and Chicago.

Tonite I used a restuarant.com coupon for this Scottsdale location on Hayden.  

The REAL, the GOOD Rosatis has a sweet sauce, and a fantastic crust.  This Rosatis has an extremely plain pizza sauce. I mean store bought basic paste almost.  barely spiced at all.  and the crust was extremely bland. The cheese and the ingredients saved it.  In all honesty...tasted EXACTLY like Beggars, but Beggars was better.  I ordered a side of pizza sauce to dip my boring crust in, and to test it.  So bland.

I dont like to give bad bad reviews.  my wife, she liked it.  She doesnt care for the REAL Rosatis sauce.  But I dont want anyone that thinks they are going to a Rosatis that they know just to be disappointed.

a man from corporate was there.  He explained that different family members owned different Rosatis   see  Rosatis.com  then see MyRosatis.com  to see the difference.

I dont think its fair that they can use the same name yet be SO different.

If you want the Flavorful Rosatis tho....choose a different location.  I can verify Warner & McLintock in Tempe, and ValVista in Gilbert and the Glendale location are all for sure the tasty good Rosatis.  Dont be fooled unless you like Dominos.


**** EDIT  ****
This location is FOR SALE again.  Looks like the newest owner only lasted a year or two?  If done correctly, a pizza joint like this can make serious revenue.  Clearly the Yelps correctly portray the state that this location is in.  Its time for a new owner, and perhaps a complete start over.  Not sure who'd pay 150k for this place tho."}
{"text":"This is a place where the staff know your name. The pizza is great - crispy and with an awesome red sauce....  also want to give a shout out to the bartender, Chris. He deserves 5 stars himself!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza. Go buy a Safeway pizza and cook it at home. We have been ordering from this location for a long time. It was good not great. But the last two pizzas have been horrible.  Do not think they even use real cheese anymore, sauce is tomato paste. Crust must come from a freezer. Stay away. Must be a new owner. Customer service is horrible also."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. After waiting an hour for my order to arrive I recieved a nasty phone call from a delivery boy letting me know \"uh hey btw youre out of our delivery zone uh BY A LOT. Call the store, bye.\" (We live 7.3 miles away.) & when I called the store the girl apologized for the confusion and told me the order was on its way. FORTY mins later when I called back, to my surprise the store had closed! Oh and the kicker? The charge for my $32.00 order is still on my card. Amazing! Unless you want to pay for incompetence and no food pick another pizza place. TRY ZIOS - get the pepperoni rolls!!!"}
{"text":"Once again I tempt myself to give this place one more try because you cant screw it up again  but don't worry the excuse this time I got was sorry we're busy tonight. I spend 50 minutes waiting for a stuffed Sausage Mushroom Onion pizza and after getting home it s freaking mushroom pizza. Being from Chicago I should know these imitation wanna be pizza places cant make a simple pizza , I m told bring it back for a redo or we can give you $6 off your next pizza after I just paid $23..please..your ass should be remaking the pizza and delivering it..next time open the flippin box to confirm the order...this location is a joke but Rosatis as a whole sux
Go to Oreganos for real customer service and pizza."}
{"text":"Close by and convenient. Just sucks it doesn't have a dine in. Makes it less interesting :) love their thin crust Jalape√±o pizza!"}
{"text":"Do not order from here. I've ordered delivery twice. I thought I'd give them a second try and maybe the first time was just a fluke. However, food is awful, consistently. My chicken fingers were dry, mushrooms were completely soggy and the caprese salad was delivered without dressing and basil. The second time I ordered from Grubhub and the delivery person insisted I needed to pay cash. Even though I used my card online. Not to mention they forgot food this time and took over 40 minutes to bring the forgotten item."}
{"text":"Re-opened under NEW management and they are back in the groove.  Have had several deliveries and always nice and hot when it gets there.  I always get extra sauce as they do tend to skimp a little, and extra crispy crust.  If you like a thin crispy crust this is it.  
We actually live just outside the delivery area delineated by the previous owners.  The new owners called up to tell us they will deliver to us at the regular charge (which is always free with coupon)!  They also call sometimes after the delivery to make sure everything was alright.  Excellent customer service.  Finally, a great pizza that can be delivered to us folk in the far north boonies."}
{"text":"Just finished delicious \"usual\"  - split large Antipasto salad (overloaded with italian meats n cheese) and hubby polished off the Combo grinder and I most ;-) of a meatball grinder.  Dang we love the ORIGINAL!"}
{"text":"This place takes way to long. 15 minutes for a Chicago dog.... Come on! 1hour for a thin crust pizza... Get real! I don't have time to waste on businesses that don't value my time. Besides the place is dirty and only has a swamp cooler. Waiting 15 minutes for a hot dog in 90 degrees is miserable. The crust isn't as good as the other Rosati's locations in town. I am done trying this place. I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place wouldn't except a valid coupon with their location on it! They told me it was expired and they don't give these out anymore. When i explained the expiration date was June 30, 2017, they claimed I had the wrong location, yet their location is listed. I told them their location was listed and the response was well sorry but we don't take these! What a bunch of crap so I took my business to Marco's Pizza at 5350 W Bell Rd and guess what....this awesome new place apologized and honored Rosati's ticket. The pizza was awesome, service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great! The best thin crust around. The cheefs are really good sanwiches! I recommend pick up over delivery and you will always have fresh hot pizza. Don't wait around for delivery"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago. Considering myself a pizza snob, I felt I had to write about this pizza. JUST AMAZING!!  Try it for yourself. Best takeout pizza in Suburban vegas area. 

Dr Bob"}
{"text":"The delivery service is always late. Pick up is ok but they aren't very polite when ordering. Barros across the street is better food and has super fast delivery."}
{"text":"Being the closest pizza place close to my house i've eaten here a handfull of times almost always with regret. Pizza is ok and the pasta dishes are horrible. Service is questionable? There is never anyone up front takes at least 5 minutes for someone to help even after ringing there little bell. One bright note is the italian beef sandwich it is amazing but not worth the trouble getting considering everything else there is sub par. Just don't expect to much!"}

{"text":"The meatball sub and Asian style wings are the bomb ;)"}
{"text":"Rosati's thin crust is probably my favorite thin crust pizza in Las Vegas.  I know they are known for their deep dish, which i've had and is also great, but their thin crust is near perfect.  Lots of toppings, great sauce, and not afraid to dish out the cheese, they make some great Za here.  A little on the pricey side compared to pizza mills like Pizza Hut and the like... but the quality here is WAY better.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza! Crust like cardboard, skimpy amount of pepperoni, overloaded with bad cheese. Even at a $5 lunch special they are ripping off the trades people working in N. Scottsdale with no other options. Shameful"}
{"text":"We really enjoy their double dough pizza especially during the first 3-4 times we ordered.

We've ordered here dozens of times but they are often inconsistent.  They cut the pizza into squares when you ask for pie cut, the pizza is often oozing with too much oil, etc.  When they do get it right, it's definitely worth the price.  Plus, it beats ordering from more mainstream chains...

They've forgotten items we ordered for delivery a couple of times.  The driver was quick to retrieve the missing items so no biggie. It's really the girl who answers the phones that's unapologetic and have the personality of a rock.

We quickly learned to start ordering online to avoid speaking with her.  She rushes on the phone, doesn't try to solve issues in a positive manner (i.e. too quick to offer refund for missing item when we paid cash and doesn't offer any apologies), treats customers without any respect and is just plain unpleasant. I never asked for her name because it's not personal and she obviously wasn't trained to be personable on the phone by at least offering her name when answering calls.

All in all, the food is somewhat above average, but the service can be much improved."}
{"text":"Place was NOT busy, 5 tables with families 3 waitresses. Based on what I overheard everyone had an issue with their orders, Rosati's is promoting \"New Management\" but apparently same crappy service. This is the closest pizza place to our home, came in to give it a second try but still bad service, we ordered appetizers that never came, everyone kept apologizing that kitchen was backed up but didn't see much movement & that was also the same excuse I got last visit. Wished it would have been better but will drive a few extra miles longer for better service."}
{"text":"We were looking for a sit down Italian restaurant with pizza to take some visitors from out of town. We had seen the sign and decided to try them. The main eating area was small and crowded. We had great food. It was very noisy and they could have had more servers but worth it.
Dave"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza! We eat here on a weekly basis and they never disappoint! TVs everywhere and great drinks!"}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE TOTALLY HORRIBLE. While the food is, let's say, OK (not the best despite the price that implies a superior product) the manager is coming directly from hell. 

Watch your credit card statement as mine was just double the amount of the meal and the merchant refuses to accept that there is a problem with it. 100% tip? Not on my receipt (which I thankfully I kept.) Thank you for the credit card protection mechanism against these vultures. Should send the Mystery Diners team there.."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza i had on the west coast
They have a great deal buy 18inch pizza and a 12 inch free and then collect 12 coupons for 50% off any pizza"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 5 stars and I would if I was rating this location on just food. My pizza was hot, fresh and perfectly cooked/topped. Employees were friendly and helpful and they made using my Groupon easy and clear. BUT their back kitchen is so dirty and old/in need of repair that I almost lost my appetite standing there waiting for my food. They weren't that busy and there were more than enough employees there to pick up a broom or wipe the counters and equipment down. The white walls are clearly yellowed and overall it's just really, really gross. I really loved my pizza so I REALLY hope they clean and repair this location because I'd love to return and refer this location to my friends."}
{"text":"Simply the worst delivery service of any place I've tried to frequent. The food kept me coming back - until I became exasperated with the lack of any attention to detail. Too bad ..."}
{"text":"Howdy, so I took a quick trip over to sin city not too long ago from Houston, Texas. Met up with family and they took me out to this pizza joint on the first night over here. Now let me tell you, being from the south you're used to the southern hospitality. I was very surprised and felt that we were very welcomed by Ashleigh, our server, and felt right at home at Rosati's. The customer attention she served was phenomenal and she made all of us laugh outta our seats. The pizza we got was amazing, but our server won us over with her quick wit and humor and I will definitely be coming back to Vegas and enjoy the amazing atmosphere this pizza joint has to offer."}
{"text":"I use to like their Pizza but the service/management sucks here.
Not sure if other locations are as bad or not but I would never come back to this place.
If you like rude people and slow ass burnt pizzas, go for it. If not, stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"The food quality and service has gone down.
Not sure what is going on here but the business is being run by kids it seems.
I now prefer other restaurants in the area like Blaze Pizza."}

{"text":"In town for Nascar Weekend my Hotel recommended them highly. I called and ordered and was told it would be less than an hour delievered...I called back at 1 hour and 15 minutes and she said she would find out where it was..I never recieved a call back...Called them back at 1.5 hours and again she said she would check on where it was.. so I canceled the order...VERY DISAPPOINTED...No follow up from host and apparently the driver couldnt make it.. I let the front desk here at The Clarendon Hotel and Spa know they might not want to have them on the top of the recommended list...NOT HAPPY"}
{"text":"had it delivered weighed about 9lbs. feel in love with the 1st bite...good eats!  It's a must try if you haven't if your scared go to church.."}
{"text":"Ordered from grub hub. Estimated delivery was 2 hrs. I thought about canceling, but decided to try it out. The pizza came slightly early with no heads up, but the pizza was cold and soggy. I got the Hawaiian thin crust. And I should have gone anywhere else or just bought a frozen pizza. 

Avoid this place at all costs. Insanely over priced for an abysmal product.

Edit. Nearly forgot the entire thing was burned."}
{"text":"If I could give this dump zero stars I would. This particular Rosati's is THE WORST IN THE ENTIRE CHAIN. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. They frequently don't have items listed on their menu; I'm gonna take a guess that whoever manages this Rosati's has about a 6th grade education. 

Remember the \"egg noodles and ketchup\" Rat Liota talks about at the end of 'Goodfellas'? This is the place he was talking about."}
{"text":"I'm too lazy to give reviews usually. It was worth the task to say this pizza is one of the best I've had in Phoenix. Menu is a fixture under my fridge magnet."}
{"text":"I ordered my first Chicago style pizza at this place and was disappointed. I don't think it was so much Rosati's fault as it just turns out Chicago style pizza sucks. It's a ridiculous concept - who needs cheese on the bottom and sauce on the top? I'm a cheese fanatic and from the first bite the texture was all wrong. You couldn't even taste the cheese it was all sauce. Ick! The crust was good and the overall taste was just above average so in fairness I will order a regular pizza from them to see if that is to my liking. Stay tuned for that review."}
{"text":"I had given this place a lackluster review from a visit a few years ago and never bothered to go there again. A few days ago I got an invitation from the owner to try the food again and hopefully be more impressed. David, the new owner, told me that they had just taken over the place and were looking to focus on great food and customer satisfaction. We ordered a pizza and appetizers this evening and came away very impressed. The pizza was the Double Dough with sausage and onions. The Double Dough is between a thin crust and deep dish, as far as the crust goes. It was baked to the right consistency and tasted very good. The sausage chunks were big and it looked like the onions were even caramelized. The cheese and sauce were both good. Overall, it was a very well-made pizza and very tasty. The appetizer that we got was a sampler platter. They had just got new menus, so I think the sampler name changed from what was on the previous menu. It included wings, fried mushrooms, mozarella sticks, jalapeno poppers and onion rings. I sampled the wings, mushrooms, mozarella sticks and jalapeno poppers, and let my wife and kids give me a rating of the onion rings. All of the appetizers were very good. The wings were barbecue, and they were slathered with sauce, which was tangy. The fried stuff was fresh-tasting, unlike the freezer-burnt flavor that fried food at some restaurants has. The jalapeno poppers were just hot enough to warrant a cold swig of beer to chase them down. They gave us plenty of ranch and marinara for dipping.

This place is pretty small, but they do have seating outside and a few tables inside, which I think they added since I had been there before. It looks like it would be a good place to stop for lunch, as there are alot of options, from pizza and sandwiches to burgers and hot dogs.

We were happy that David gave us the opportunity to sample their food and give them a much needed second chance. It is only a half-mile from our house, so it's very convenient for us. We will definitely be returning and telling our friends and neighbors about the good food that they're serving there."}
{"text":"Yes, this place use to be not so good, but boy have they improved! I am not sure if there are new owners or if they have just upped their game but the food here terrific! The wings are juicy. The calzones are HUGE! They have the best french fries around. We are going to try the pizza for the first time since the big change over and I will let you know how it goes. Wish me luck!"}
{"text":"Good local place. Spotlessly Clean. Decent Pizza and salad at the weekday noon buffet for $ 6.00. Two types of Pizza on bar - Sausage and Cheese. In this part of town very good pizza. I still consider Metro Pizza on Flamingo The Best in town."}
{"text":"I enjoy their thin crust pizza. The sauce has a spicy taste. Not the best pizza, but I haven't found any great pizza in Las Vegas. I hope they find a new garlic knot recipe...yuck. I did enjoy the new dining area, plenty of TV's. They are close to where I live...so for now Rosati's will do."}
{"text":"Hard to find a good deep dish place in the valley.  This is just that; a great deep dish place.  Quality ingredients, perfectly cooked, and they deliver.  The prices are fair as well."}
{"text":"We just spent $21.00 on a 16\" pizza with no meat.  When we asked for water they said they only had bottled water..  I decided that was ridiculous so went back in to ask again
  I got a sarcastic reply that they had bottled water for $1.00
  Not coming back here -I don't need the attitude."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $15 for a pizza you can make at home, you'll love this place! I feel thoroughly cheated paying $15 for a pizza that was the equivalent of 3 tiny frozen at-home pizza slices...but wait...they cut it into 20 1\"X1\" pieces to make you feel like you're getting more--all you're getting is duped! Aside from the outrageous prices, the server was very sweet and hospitable (even though I could tell the owners forced her to up sell probably a minimum of 3x per table). 

Not going back...go next door to Roberto's where you'll get a decent amount of food for what you pay."}
{"text":"Just got two beefs sandwiches,was told they come with fries. No fries,Called back said they were sorry. They should've told the people who make the orders to put in fries last time to go there"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago this is the closest I've found. Not only do they have Gluten Free at this location it's yummy"}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my favorite things to eat I have tried many pizza places around Vegas, this Rosati's ranks up there with the best of them, great food and service to match. The new owner is do a great job carry on the Rosati's tradition this is my new go to for pizza. Dave"}
{"text":"I loovvvvve this Rosatis! By far the best in the valley! Great food and service! Lots of drink selections and I love the double dough pizza! The salads are also spectacular! I always get the chicken Caesar salad! Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after my brother in law raved about the pizza. Well first off it's not the cleanest appearing place when you step up to the counter. Ok, I can look past that, maybe they were busy prior to my walking in. I then ordered a pizza and was told the standard 20 mins which is fine. I figured I'd walk around the shopping center it's in and pick up something from the grocery store while I waited. Put my purchases in the car and went back in to see if my order was ready only to wait a total of 54 minutes. During this time I watched the pizza maker do some rather disappointing things from a sanitation standpoint.
Evidently the refer door below where he was making pizzas is broken so in order to hold it up a wood block has to be put on the floor under the door. This block had to be removed/replaced every time the door is touched so his hand(s) have to touch the floor and this old nasty block. Unfortunately he never bothered to wash his hands, never put on any kind of glove which equals contamination. 
Given the response of the person at the counter after it had taken almost an hour to get my pizza (delivery seemed to be busy but I was the only carry out and the tables were empty) I took the pie home and tossed it out as the risk of illness wasn't worth the reward in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm only giving them one star because the Italian beefs are good. But other then that this place need to be shut down. I order a burger last night and not only I had to wait over an hour when I got it it was RAW. I spit it out and call them back, the guy on the phone was not remorseful at all in fact he didn't even apologize just said \"I'll see if i can get another one sent out\" like really. So eventually another one came like 45 mins after. I have pictures and will be calling the health Dept."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza's were good, would liked to have more veggies on the vegetarian though. The buffalo chicken wings didn't come with any celery, but at least they were cooked well. A little pricey though. Friendly and clean atmosphere. The server was very attentive. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Open defiantly not closed!  
and simply the best; sausage, cheese, crust and sauce. I'm from Chicago and rate it a perfect 10."}
{"text":"I ordered the smallest sized Chicago style pizza with meatballs as the topping to be delivered, it cost me around $20 and the pizza is amazing - crispy crust (though I don't eat the ends because they're too crispy), plenty of cheese, lots of tasty tomatoes and \"mama mia!\" meatballs. This pie will feed me for a week. I will definitely be ordering again when I get a hankerin'."}
{"text":"The other night I went here with the family at 7PM.  90 minutes later, we received the wrong pizza.  I complained to a self absorbed, preening, 20-something who claimed she was the manager (who actually wasn't), and she could not have cared less.  I then got a lecture from the waitress that replaced our original server, who quit and walked out in the middle of dinner in disgust, telling me that I should complain to the real manager, who wasn't there.  I have managed my own businesses for 38 years, and I can't tell you how excited I was to be lectured by an 18 year old.
This place is pathetic.  According to another server, the owner doesn't care either.  If you eat here, you are wasting your money on an expensive, inconsistent meal, delivered to your table after you starve waiting.  Two days later, I ordered a pizza from Dominos for delivery at my house.  It was great, came in 28 minutes, and cost 1/3rd the price of Rosati's!"}
{"text":"Checked out the new location on Eastern and the pizza was awesome!  Glad to see this one is close to my work.  Good Luck on the new location..."}
{"text":"Just stopped by Rosati's and got a delicious thin crust pizza.  Also they finally got the liquor license and the bar is coming right along.  Tried the Tenaya Creek Bonanza Brown and was pleasantly surprised!  Server was very helpful!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer of Rosati's, and have nothing but good things to say about them. I have my orders delivered, and they're mostly here earlier than their projection.  I get spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna about once a week, and pizza once or twice a month.  The spaghetti and lasagna are good, not great, but very good, and, they'll make me a salad without onions.  The pizza is best around here, don't know what they do that the other places don't or can't, but they're very flavorful.  Pizza costs a bit more than other places, but is worth every cent."}
{"text":"Consistently good until tonight. 2 pizzas. 1 spot on the other hardly any cheese. Spoke with the manager and was told sometimes the pies are made with ez cheese depending on the maker. Not acceptable - she offered a small discount on future order. No excuse for using a less toppings on a $25 pie. Will no longer order from Power Rd Rosati's."}
{"text":"Hell no. Never again. Food is not bad 6 of 10 but the service is trash. Girl at the front with dredsis busy being catty with the  girl who loves throwing daggers at customers who are waiting for their food. Crapped out the food an hour later which means prob full of bacteria. Sign out front says under new ownership which means they admit the last owner was bad? Catty catty. Not getting another 13 for lasagna from me. If i want trash service ill go to mcdonalds"}
{"text":"Just Delish! Dont forget the hot Peppers!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Vegas....not even close! The breadsticks and penne with broccoli are also awesome!"}
{"text":"Needed pizza/wanted pizza!!

We ordered a full order of chicken strips, medium heat with ranch dressing on the side and a pizza.  When we got home the pizza was perfect, but the chicken strips had no seasoning at all and the ranch dressing was missing.  Too far to go back, so we just dealt with it.  We should not have to just deal with it.  

This location is extremely small (approximately 6-8 tables) and there were only two couples in the restaurant at the time, so busy would not be a possible excuse.  I saw five uniformed employees and one individual with an outfit that would suggest he was a manager.  So, there was more than enough staff to remember something as simple as ranch dressing and seasoning on chicken strips.

Don't get me wrong I do like Rosati's A LOT - however, it is so frustrating when you do not receive what you ordered and you didn't check before leaving the restaurant because you assume seasoning and ranch dressing isn't so difficult to remember.  

We have never got takeout at Rosati's, we typically go to the one up North off of Durango.  So, next time we want pizza, we'll have to go and eat at the restaurant as it seems the West Cheyenne location can't manage to fully and/or correctly prepare a takeout order."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  The customer service was horrid.  Upon arrival I was not greeted; rather, the cashier asked what I wanted.  I informed him I was there to pick up an order, which I could see sitting in the hold bay, but it still took him five minutes to get around to ringing me up and giving me my order.  After getting home, I discovered the pizza did not have cheese and had about five pieces of sausage for a 16\" deep dish.  I called the location fully expecting them to offer to remake the pizza; instead, they merely offered me a discount on a future purchase.   What future purchase?  I am completely done with Rosati's.  Now I understand why so many of their locations have been shuttered in the last year."}
{"text":"First time ordering today. 
Got the Chicago style 14\" Classic Combo and it was delicious.
Probably my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area so far.
I'm going back soon.
Go."}
{"text":"So glad these guys are near my home.  Eagerly awaiting the grand opening of the rosati's on s power Rd,  weeks turned to days,  days turned to this past Monday and I missed it.  . Some fan huh?! But now it's Thursday and I've finally got my rosati's fix.  The crew was great,  Michael the mgr, hooked it up with some tasty cinnamon sticks, AWESOME! I ordered a thin crust monster with no green peppers,  bbq wings and some fried ravioli. Everything was sublime.  Loved it!! Crispy crust that held all the toppings on it,  tender well cooked wings with great flavor,  and ravioli was on point.  Family loved it.  Round two will be pizza leftover's for breakfast! Thanks guys,  we'll be back. Cory austin"}
{"text":"I paid $6.00 for an order of breaded mushrooms. There were 11 mushrooms when my order arrived. Total rip off and won't be repeating this mistake."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had! Crispy, thin crust (even after it was delivered!) and delicious toppings! We will order from them again!"}
{"text":"My only issue is that my deep dish pizza was $2.00 more (before tax) than what is listed on their online and hand out menu. I didn't add any additional toppings for that to make sense, but that being said..

Their deep dish pizza is AMAZING! A small weighs like 5 pounds. And so much better than any place that sells \"deep dish\" when it's actually just a thick crust. This is legit."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place when we want food delivered right to our door or my husband wants to do a quick carryout. We live a few miles down the road and we normally wait between 45 minutes to an hour for deliveries, but only around 20 minutes for carryout. 

I would say 90% of the time we get this, our food is great for a chain pizza joint. We prefer it much more over Dominos or Pizza Hut. The few times our food is sub par is usually when we order food that isn't pizza. The last couple of times, for example, we ordered jalape√±o poppers as a side and when they showed up, all of the breading had fallen off inside the box. There have been other times, however, where they come perfectly fine. I think it depends on the day.

The staff have always been very friendly, but we have never actually sat down to eat inside the restaurant so I cannot comment as to the environment. It always seems clean when we are waiting in line for our carryout orders. The delivery staff is always extremely friendly. They even delivered to our specific hotel room a couple of times when my apartment had flooded and I had to move out for repairs.

Overall, if you are looking for some decent pizza at a fairly cheap price (for the Madison area), this is a good place!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Chicago and fell in love with the stuffed pizza there.  Rosati's serves the closest thing to the genuine article I've ever had outside the Windy City.  Rosati's crust is a little too chewy, their olives are quite a bit too pungent, and the spinach is much, much too bitter, but the cheese and sausage are perfect."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.....ok service. It's not that they are bad it's just a few employees don't seem to value customers as much as they should"}
{"text":"Rosario sports pub has great potential.  The food is good, however the kitchen needs to get its act together.   There needs to be a strong manager on site that can manage the kitchen. We have dined at this location twice and have had food service issues.  You shouldn't have to wait up to 40 minutes to get salads, sandwiches and appetizers. 
With the exception of the servers who have to apologize for the delays- no one else appears to care. 
I haven't seen a manager at this location since it opened."}
{"text":"The staff is rude a.f and it's wayyyyyy over priced!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 15 dollars for a dozen of wings? Ummmm no."}
{"text":"Ordered from here tonight. I was so excited to have deep dish! I lived in Chicago for 37 years and terribly miss deep dish. So glad Rosati's is out here in Las Vegas. Until tonight. My pizza I had delivered was raw. The supervisor Alison was very rude. Kept saying they're all timed so it can't be raw. She wouldn't let me get a word in. Amateur supervisor no doubt. Her manager wouldn't let her refund it without the pizza. Are you kidding me?! What are they going to do with it? After I paid for delivery, they wanted me to drive it back. Sorry, have your driver come get it. After too much discussion they finally did. I showed the driver and she said \"that's what it's supposed to look like\". Sorry, I have had many deep dish and none were raw. This is clearly NOT what it's supposed to look like. They wouldn't refund delivery either. Terrible pizza and even worse customer service! I had to give one star or this wouldn't post, but I'd really give them no stars."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza I've had in AZ. I've had the pizza, wings, a couple of their sandwiches and it's all great so far. The marinara sauce is way better than  what your going to get at any of the chain style pizza places. Coke products, if you care about that kind of thing."}
{"text":"The pizza is a little more expensive than Papa John's or Pizza Hut, but you get what you pay for.  The ingredients and service are awesome.  Their beef sandwiches are awesome as well.  Best pizza in the area for sure."}
{"text":"I tried ordering online through a third-party, and there was a mix-up with my order. The manager, Mayra, was very apologetic and accommodating in fixing the problem. I really appreciated the excellent customer service, and the pizza was delicious, too! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"They don't take \"third party\" coupons like the one they offer here on YELP! I called and the girl working stated that I would have to cancel my order with YELP/Eat24 and place a new order with them over the phone. 

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! 

Yet to taste anything by they are now over an hour and a half later so I will update this review accordingly..."}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone for delivery, everything seemed to go smoothly.

I ordered two pizzas, the first one was black olives and pepperoni with alfredo sauce instead of pizza sauce, it was decent. Not the greatest I've ever had but not bad by any means.

The problem came with the second pizza. I had ordered a Cheesy Beef pizza w/ hot peppers which was supposed to have an au jus gravy type sauce instead of pizza sauce. I ordered this straight from the menu without changing anything at all. The pizza I received was a cheese pizza with green peppers, that is it. It had no beef on it, the peppers were wrong, and it had regular pizza sauce. I checked the receipt and sure enough they had it down properly as the Cheesy Beef pizza. It cost me $23 when the pizza I got was sold at around $16-17 on the menu.

I didn't bother calling them back to get it fixed because I don't feel like the delivery driver should have to pay for the cooks mistake by wasting his gas. I will never be ordering from Rosatis again because of this. The price of the pizza puts it in the premium bracket and yet the service is definitely lacking if they can't even make a pizza correctly off their own specialty menu."}
{"text":"With all the 5 and $10 pizza places out there I never would have tried Rosatis without a certificate I purchased on restaurant.com. I ended up paying $16.37 for a 16' Chicago style one topping pie. It was well worth it and I plan on going back with or without any sort of discount. The pie was pizza perfection! They told me 35 minutes until it was ready and it took exactly that. I was greeted with a smile, no hassle getting the discount and I didn't have to ask for Parm and peppers which is never the case at any of the other places I have been. Quality food and service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD. Not only did they have me waiting for a pizza an hour that never shows. The manager then got on the phone and lied and said somebody must've called and voided my order. Not I'm sorry sir we will have ur order out to u fast and for free. No they were actually gonna make me wait even longer and pay full price. What a joke I feel bad whoever pays for that type of service. U better off going and getting the pizza from 7-11!"}
{"text":"Good food but poor service.  If they ever get the service thing figured out its 4-5 star."}
{"text":"I like Italian cuisine. I also like a good date night. This visit was so underwhelming that I will now rate the Olive Garden chain as fine Italian dining at its very, very best. We were here on a early weekday night with a very light crowd. Unfortunately, we did not order pizza. We had the restaurant.com certificate and thought we would try the pasta entrees. My date had shrimp fettuccine alfredo and I ordered a sort of baked ziti with sausage - the sausage was served separately!?! 

The shrimp was in actuality salad shrimp. It looked like noodles with pieces of pink lucky charms in them with a taste of noodles with a nondescript presence of fish. The pasta with sausage tasted like it was just made, thawed out and served by the school cafeteria. It gave me the feeling that someone did scoop out something and plopped it on my plate as a carried the tray to the cashier. I should've had a bowl of tapioca or something on the side! The was one step better in that we were able to eat without someone yelling food fight! 

Nice small place. You could pass it without seeing it in this area. No big signage. The toilet in the woman's room did not work properly. The restaurant.com certificate was blamed for a miscalculated bill. The pizza may be authentic but certainly not the pastas. My date and I are still together but this would be an ideal place to go if you wanted to break up."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying their food and it was AMAZING! I will definitely be ordering from them again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for the service & quality. Kitchen looks dirty from the front counter. They make mistakes a lot w my order, I have finally decided to stop giving them \"another chance\"  I asked the manager to call me... She never did."}
{"text":"Not the first time I've had Rosati's, but this store is fantastic! Their Super Supreme stuffed pizza tastes amazing and is surprisingly filling! The management is quite friendly there and the delivery is pretty snappy! Try it out.. You'll love it!!"}
{"text":"One thing I noticed about Rosati's pizza as opposed to my local pizzeria is they do not over-sauce the pizza.  For me, this is a good thing.  The pizza I ordered was hot and ready exactly to the minute of when they said it would be ready...I was impressed.  I got it home and dove in.  OMG...the thick crust was delicious and baked to perfection.  Not over cooked anywhere.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings.  The only thing in my mind preventing the from being a 5 star is the lack of a dining area.  My pizza was definitely a 5 star offering."}
{"text":"The absolute worst place to order pizza and wings from! I ordered for delivery and not only was the pizza and wings chilled by the time I got them but the pizza wasn't even cooked all the way through! The hot wings were more like \"cream of wing\"....they were sooooo soggy and looked as if they had a super creamy paste on them....I hesitated eating any of the food I ordered. I ended up getting a ride to the location to bring in the recipt and get my money back and the assistant manager acted as if he had the worst attitude and declined giving my money back then proceeded to tell me I should not have waited so long to complain about the food. This place not only lacks quality food but also quality customer service!"}
{"text":"Laughable that anyone would rate this place 5 stars. In the Chicagoland area Rosati's is right up there with pizza hut, but they have the audacity to be twice the price. A pizza from Rosati's is only edible after 12-15 blue moons. I don't want to know what you people rated papa johns..."}
{"text":"Don't order delivery from here....forgot our salads and tarter sauce for our fish. We won't be using them again. One delivery guy tried to charge his own tip to our order. Done...never again"}
{"text":"We ordered online on a Sunday night about 715..finally got our food delivered around 840. Didn't think they'd be so busy on a Sunday night. My husband's calzone was soggy and falling apart. My fried mushrooms and husbands hot wings were soggy. Garlic bread was tough. None of the food was hot...I wouldn't even really call it warm either. We don't have many delivery options where we live, so now our options are even more limited. And on top of the less than sub par food, when I called to see when our food would come, the employee argued with me about what time I actually placed the order. We won't be ordering Rosatis again."}
{"text":"Usually decent. Tonight was tough. Quoted 45 minutes and it ended up being an hour ten. Ok its friday night. Delivery guy was passive about it. So when we dug into dinner we got the wrong olives. The ticket had what we ordered correctly. It just threw off the dynamic of the pizza. Not sure what is going on over there. The girl on the phone seemed lost. To much competition in the area to give them a thought next time.......too bad they were once the cream of the crop."}

{"text":"DO NOT order delivery from here... it's horrible! Took an hour and fifteen mins and the pizza was cold because the driver got lost."}
{"text":"Very very slow service... It was just the two of us and another table of two. Took an hour for our pizza. Pizza was good once we got it."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings online.  Delivery driver left a message on my phone that she left the food at my front door.  No food at my front door.  I called the delivery driver's number that was on my caller id....no answer until I blocked my number.  Delivery driver claimed to have left the food at the front door and someone must have walked by and taken it (My front door is not visible from any walkway so very doubtful).  Called the store and they told me there was nothing they could do until a manager got there an hour later--and again said that someone must have walked by my apartment and took it.  Got a call about 45 minutes later from a gentleman down the street to let me know that my food was sitting at his door when he got home from work.  I called the store back and told them that the delivery person delivered it to the wrong address.  POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Someone needs to teach their employees that you DO NOT blame the customer for YOUR mistake.  Will NEVER order pizza from this store again."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but a bit pricey.  Great for quick takeout.  Wouldn't recommend dining in.  One of the few pizza places you can get green olives on your pizza."}
{"text":"While staying at a Best Western in Tempe, ordered Rosati's for delivery. The pizza was delivered in promised time frame. It was a thin crust, and was baked to perfection - cheese covered the other toppings and was nicely browned. The salads we ordered were crisp and garden fresh with high quality dressings (Ken's), and packaged croutons.  I had failed to mention the 5$ off coupon I had while ordering by phone, but called while delivery person waited - person on phone was extremely pleasant and happy to make the price adjustment."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome. The service is fair and friendly. The food came out fast every though it was busy. Atmosphere was relaxed and chill. This location was busy but staff worked together well and was attentive."}
{"text":"My wife hates when I order Rosati's for takeout, but being from Chicago, I think it is a great pizza for the price.  I always get the thin crust sausage and mushroom pizza.  I order it on the nights that my wife is at work:-).  I really have not tried anything else there but this pizza, and it suits me fine."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pizza and wings. Haven't tried much else yet, but I plan to. Great happy hour, relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, all around a great place for lunch or dinner or just to grab a drink."}

{"text":"If you do not like to gamble, I do not recommend Rosati's. I have eaten here multiple times and it has been among the best and the worst food experiences I have had. Sometimes, the food here is delicious. It smells great, looks tasty, and leaves you saying \"this is soooooooo good.\" At other times, the food looks hastily put together, smells slightly undercooked, and tastes like the ingredients are way out of proportion. For me, the amount of good versus bad has been about fifty-fifty. So, if you like those odds, I definitely recommend Rosati's. However, be warned. While you may end up getting some of the best food you've ever eaten, odds are equally good that you'll be incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"I've ate at Rosati's many times but this is the first time at this location. The Calzone was delicious as usual. My only complaint is the restaurant was very hot. Not sure if the A/C was out or that's how they kept it normally. My order was take out so it did not bother me that much but I would have been very unhappy if I was dinning in."}
{"text":"We made a delivery order and live 1 mile away, it took 2 hours for our food to arrive.  When the driver finally arrived he said my boss forgot a pizza and we would be able to get $10 off of our next order.  We opened the that we did get and the pizza was smashed to one side with the pizza toppings off of the pizza.  We ordered garlic parmesan boneless wings.  There was so much sauce on the wings that they were inedible. It was as if they out a bottle of caesar dressing on top.  I called back and they did offer me a free pizza the next time I order.  Unfortunately I paid $50 to find out that we will never frequent there business again."}

can't wait to try their  deep-dish ."}
{"text":"Rosati's? Out west?  Forget about it.  

If you're in Phoenix and you like pizza you better order Rosati's.  If you don't it better be because you're busy eating right now at Oregano's.  

Thin crust all day"}
{"text":"Be careful ordering from this place esp if youre using your credit  card.make sure youre not OVERCHARGED.its so fast for them to charge your card but theyll make you wait to get credit back for a WRONG CHARGE.Lexi Mancia MOD today 6-14 CANT help me and transferred me to their delivery guy who of course cant do anything.will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Great food, great people! Went to their soft opening and was really impressed with everything even though they were working the kinks out."}

Thanks Rosatis, we will be ordering again often :)"}
{"text":"After meaning to try this place for 3 years we finally got to them...WOW... great pizza.  Crust, cheese, meat, vegies all excellent.  Try 'em, they are our new regular place.  They are so much better than the national chains its not funny.  They are not cheap, but do you ever get what you pay for!  The best.  Had the sausage/pepporoni/olive/green pepper thin crust and it was great.  And large is large!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I use dot eat here quite a bit. It is more expensive, but you get what you pay for. The other menu items have always been very good also. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Rosati's pizza was both amazingly good and reasonably priced. We opted for delivery, and our thin crust pizza arrived within 45 minutes, hot and fresh with a light, crispy crust. It really was one of the best pizzas I've had--and being from Chicago originally, I'm pretty snobbish about pizza."}
{"text":"I used to order from this place at least twice a month, if not once a week. The food was great, consistent and decently priced. Ever since the new ownership, the food has gone downhill. The salads are brown and wilted, the staff gets confused when you order something custom, they often forget parts of your order for delivery and the last two times our pizza looked like it was stored on its side. Totally ruined the pizza and the experience. If you want something quick, it's not bad but there's a much better Rosati's nearby."}
{"text":"(First Yelp review)

First time ordering through Rosati's.  I'm tired of pizza, so I thought I'd try to mix it up a bit and get a sandwich and some sides: meatball parm, garlic wings, and cheese fries.

The delivery went OK, no complaints there.  The delivery charge was reasonable (about half that of most folks on Grubhub) and the timing was decent.  The food, however was an absolute travesty.

- SO MUCH SALT.  I was unable to finish a single dish because everything was drenched in salt.  The bread, the cheese, the meatballs.... all one big briny mess.  

- The cheese on the sandwich was felt plasticky and tasteless.  I'm pretty sure the cheese on the cheese fries came out of a can.  Maybe I expected too much from a restaurant in Wisconsin (I didn't realize Rosati's was a chain.  I was thinking more along the lines of AJ's in Verona), but I always expect the cheese to be good, at least.

- The garlic bread was hard instead of crispy, salty instead of garlicky.

- The one positive was that that the Diet Coke was cold.

So, in the future... no.  Maybe I just got a bad sample, but it was bad enough that I'm not going to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place. I love their pizza that is naturally thin crust. We used to order it in north Phoenix and decided to do so a couple times since moving. I have noticed that there seems to be 2 franchises and you will only find half of the locations on one site and the other half  on a similar site.  For the myrosatis.com I have yet to have a great experience. We received the wrong order this time and I took us 2 hours to get what we ordered. My fianc√© keeps telling me to give up on this place. Let's just say we ate in silence tonight. Just noticed that the other rosatis of almost equal distance and different website has much better reviews. If my fianc√© ever let's us get pizza again from here we will be going to the other one. I still love the pizza and garlic bread. When it is hot."}
{"text":"I love the pizza but the delivery is never on time and the pizza has yet to be hot let alone warm. I really like the pizza I just wish they could staff appropriately for delivery."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but nothing our if the ordinary. We've had better pizza and wings elsewhere. We ordered a Chicago style pizza with Canadian bacon and pineapple on all of it and jalape√±os on half. There was a total of 3 pieces of pineapple on the entire pizza And Canadian bacon on half. My husband described it as a cheese pizza with half jalape√±os. For paying $3 for Canadian bacon and pineapple we were disappointed. We were quoted an estimate time between 6:25 and 6:45. We later got a text saying eta was between 6:50 and 7:05. They delivered at 7:12. If you're going to change the delivery time to 30 minutes LATER than originally quoted, you should be on time with that quote.    And to top it all off, my daughter was sick and crying. The delivery lady put the warming box on the ground out front and stuck her head into my house looking for the crying baby BEFORE giving us our food that was already paid for and proceeded to ask questions about why she was crying. She crouched down to the ground, gave us the food and said that the Chicago pizzas get really messy on the drive. The box was sopping wet and flimsy.  The pizza and wings were luke warm. 

We won't be ordering from Rosati's in the future.  OK food, nosey employees, late delivery, put the food on the ground before handing to me, soppy wet mushy pizza box, minimal toppings.  Definitely NOT worth the $40 we spent."}
{"text":"If industrial,  poor quality Chicago-chain pizza on a matzoh-style crust cut into 2\" squares is what you crave, this is your place.  Sticky table tops and the smell of spilt beer complete the setting. Go Bears. Ya dig?"}
{"text":"The food was really good! Ordered the Chicago style pie and did not disappoint. Also ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was just \"okay\". Was more like a giant chicken finger on bread - however, the bread was really good, too!  Our biggest disappointment was with the young lady working the front. This was our first time trying rosatis's and the service seemed icy cold from the minute we walked in. It seemed clearer to us that we could have been being judged by the employee as everyone else who came in got warm greetings, follow up and friendly conversation.   I'm pretty certain the money from gay people is just as good as everyone else's.  This is simply an observation and how we were made to feel during our dining in experience."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza when I'm out in Las Vegas.  The real deal.  Also, the appetizers are amazing.  TOASTED RAVIOLI!!!!  Gotta try this place if you haven't gone."}
{"text":"Never going here again!  I purchased a pizza to go for myself and co-workers for lunch.  Online it said the pizza would cost $16.  When I got there I was charged $26.  When I asked about the price discrepancy they told me the website hadn't been updated and that they could not honor that price that was listed online.  If I hadn't been feeding my coworkers with that pizza I would have left without it.  Plus the pizza was not all that appetizing :(

Never again.  Terrible."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Rosatti's for the past 9 years. They've been through many ownership and management changes, so we've seen the best of times, and the worst of times. We started shifting to Streets of New York when our call would go unanswered. We ordered tonight and found that new management (Pablo) was taking over. He was pleasant on the phone, and basically guaranteed that we'd be pleased. OMG. We had no idea that the pizza we'd receive was going to be life changing (okay, said for effect to some degree). It was hot and amazing. Really loaded with toppings. I mean, REALLY. Quality wins... I'll pay extra all day long for high quality. Oh... But their coupons rock, nonetheless. I hope these guys succeed. Nice to have them in the hood."}
{"text":"We are loyal customers at Rosatis. Absolutely love ordering from here the food is great. Fast delivery and the delivery man was very nice and friendly.

The only thing i would like to mention is that they need to double check the order before sending it out.
A couple times they've forgotten a few things I requested for extras.
Or the order is wrong few times.
Cashiers do repeat our order every time we do order. Whoever is sending out the order please check and make sure the food is correct. 

Side note: i bought my own wing sauce in case you guys forget my extra sauce lol"}
{"text":"Tonight could have been awful. I order from this location often, and always order hot sauce with my pizza (if you haven't tried their hot sauce, you're missing out). When my order arrived, the sauce was missing, so I called them up to let them know. Not only did they deliver my sauce to me, but they brought me brownies (I guess it helps being a repeat customer). So, GREAT JOB on the Service Recovery. I won't let this little hiccup stop me from ordering in the future."}
{"text":"I have now ordered food from them twice through Grubhub. The first time we ordered two build your own pasta dishes.  After waiting a long time we called and a very friendly woman told us there had been a mistake, the food arrived while I was still on the phone with her.  I was ready to be angry and expected the food to be wrong and cold, but it was perfect.  The plates were enough to feed four people. 
     We decided to try them again and this time we got their hamburger and Italian Beef sandwich.  It took an hour to get here, but again the food was hot and really good.  I was happy that they put the au jus  for my sandwich on the side and that they gave me enough. I think we will use them on a regular basis, but now know that we need to order the food a little early.  It really is worth the wait though.
      After a third time of ordering from them, I have to say they are awesome.  I absolutely love their Italian beef sandwich.  I appreciate the fact that they don't charge extra to get sweet peppers and giardiniera."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Perhaps the better pizza outside of downtown. We ordered a gyro pizza on the thin crust which was really quite good. They make a yummy pizza.

On the downside, the ceaser salad was a few torn pieces of romaine, shred of parmesan, and a vinegar based ceaser dressing. Not good. No effort to actually make it a dish worth eating. For comparison Lou Malnatis makes an excellent ceaser salad. Also, free breadsticks with the pizza for the monday special were alright. Better than the salad but not worth buying if they ain't free although the marinara sauce tasted pretty good. A simple tomatoey marinara.

So I would come again but avoid the side dishes and stick to the main events."}
{"text":"Brand new owners remodeled the place and brought back the quality that we were used to in the past. Staff is friendly, pizza is priced well and service is quick. I'm happy these guys took it over. The owners stopped by while we were there and chatted with us for a little, never has that before at a shop like this. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is not very good. They never have what's on the menu. And lastly overpriced. So if you want to pay a lot for something you don't actually want that doesn't taste that good, Rosati's is for you. I will pass. And I've tried them at least a dozen times over the last 4 years. Always a let down."}
{"text":"Best pizza in phoenix to date. It stinks this location doesn't have dine in, but its ok. My fav? The \"classic combo\" on thin crust. If you don't like this and the flavors don't explode in your mouth, I'm at a loss for words. The absolute best pizza money can buy. I have NO problem paying $20+ for a large combo pizza when the end result is this. I can't get over how amazing it is.

They are pretty busy so make your to-go or delivery orders early. The staff is really nice, even when they are super busy. On each pizza box, they have coupons you cut-out. Save 12 of those up, and you get 50% off any pizza of your choice.

The wings are also excellent.

A+"}
{"text":"The service at this location is amazing! Gabriel at the front was super friendly and helpful. One of the best customer service experiences I have ever received!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the food I ordered a few wees ago, the chief I think it's called. If you ever had an Italian beef sandwich with cheese, then you know. This was not! Over 40 years this was the worst one ever. Freezer burned buns that had section in them like tare a part dinner rolls. The a juice taste like they knocked the salt over in it, god awful.  This past Monday night I ordered a pizza from them on line. I arrive to pick up my pie but the young man behind the bar has no clue where my order or pie is. So this short balled guy with an goatee and looks like he cooks for the local prison comes around the bar and picks up the fax right on top of the cash drawer and tells the kid \" you have to bring these in the back\" The kid walks away from me and says nothing. Pretty clear they forgot my order? AH yes. The kid is trying to avoid me hard, so the girl comes out of the kitchen and I ask for my pie, she checks and says \"it will be 5 minutes\" meanwhile the kid is trying to sweep but he cant get the hang of it so the girl shows him how. 

Now after the 5 minutes has passed I ask the girl what happen to my order, she blames the online order proses, the fax machine jammed and it cam in late. The she puts the fax down in front of me. Little does she know that fax have time and date stapes on them.......lol The got the order at 7:56 and I arrived at 8:25, I didn't leave until 8:42.

Thinking I got my pie and shit happens, I head down Dynamite to home. Sit down and un pause the ball game and enjoy my pizza. Oh no, the pizza is dam near raw,,,,.............needles to say I am pretty angry at this point. So a call to the pizza place and a just a minute let me get the manager, who must of shown up in the 7 minutes it took me to get home. So they give me a credit .....or lol so she says....

Why couldn't you kids just admit you made a mistake....?  Between the stoned employees, the prison cook and the goofy chubby girl behind the bar it's no wonder the reviews all complain about the service. 

TC"}
{"text":"Part of the problem with this location is the menu is not consistent with the other local franchisee (which more closely resembles the Chicago area menu) and the large delivery area, which leads to slow deliveries and cold food.  Instead of being greedy to compete with the other franchisee this store should reduce its delivery area drastically.  Also the consistency of the pizza is never the same, the amount of toppings, the way it is cooked, etc etc."}
{"text":"I checked in because I was excited to have some beer and a little chicken alfredo pizza. The place wasn't even that busy and 15 minutes later they still hadn't taken my drink order. Wish Yelp had a \"Check Out\" option because I'm out of here and heading to Buffalo Wild Wings! Service is rated 0/5 and I can't rate the food because well...yeah. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yummy! There are around 5 pizza places nearby. This one has the best food for the price. Lots of options and pizza tastes fresh. Not sure why the reviews are not better for this place than the Barro's place across the street ...I went by reviews and trued that place first and that place was nasty"}
{"text":"The driver apologized for the food being late and we only paid half the price. So, the stars  went up. We still love the food at Rosatis on Thomas. It tastes better then the one near our home. 

Manager working in hiccups. Addressed my comment. Back up to five stars."}
{"text":"The lighting is subdued, the decor quaint, and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. I liked the hand-painted wall murals and the Rosati's Italian sauce cans that bordered the ceiling. Adele music filled the small restaurant that has just six booths and three tables. It was very pleasant. Rosati's was busy the entire time we were there - there were always one or two groups waiting to be seated. Our server (Lindsey) was spectacular. We ordered a medium Chicago style pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onion, mushroom and black olive. It was much too much pizza - they are very generous with the toppings. The pizza was very good. The prices were reasonable. It is a great place for a couple or a small group (4-5) to enjoy a pizza/pasta night."}
{"text":"A-freaking-mazing!  

I feel upon this place because I did a Google search for Hungry Howie's Pizza that's just up the road from me.  It was one of those days where cooking was not an option due to laziness.  So, I saw the number for Rosati's Pizza and called, ordered a spinach, tomato and mushroom 12\" pizza and had it delivered within the hour.

Pros:  

The best tasting pizza I've had in years.  Its good quality ingredients which gave it bold flavor. It taste like someone knows how to cook and cares about what they serve to customers.  Im thinking the cook should try out for Master Chef, give Gordon Ramsey a taste of this pizza.

The delivery was quick and the pizza guy was nice.

Menu is online with lots of choices, even dishes other than pizza.

Crust was A+.  I reheated it the next day in the toaster oven and it was still delicious.

Cons:  

Cost.  Ok, I know its commonly said that you get what you pay for which is true in the case of the cardboard pizza impostures that sell pies for $6 and flavor their crust...Yuck.  Yet I spent over $20 to have the12\" pizza with three toppings delivered less than a mile away.  That's a hefty penny for pizza that size even if the ingredients are good quality.  That stinks cause it will make me order less often.

Overall, this was a good find and you should give it a try."}
{"text":"It was very disappointing to order from this restaurant. I was a visitor in the city and my hotel had their flyer in the lobby as one of the restaurants that delivers. The food quality wasn't very good. I ordered Mango Habanero sauce for my chicken wings order, and it tasted no where near a spicy mango flavor. The taste was sweet and spicy BBQ sauce. I don't care for the BBQ flavor, so it was disappointing to smell and taste the sauce.
I also ordered what it said as pistachios cannolis. Surprisingly it was no where near pistachios. It was frozen solid, with green coloring on both ends of the cannoli. No pistachios or nuts of any kind in the cannoli, except for the green food coloring and some chocolate chips . I opened the frozen cannoli and the filling tasted chalky. I am not sure of the ingredients. In the end, the only good thing that was edible was the side salad that I ordered. Despite my order was simple that consisted of 6 wings, 2 cannoli and a side salad, it came up to $19 and change!!!!!??? I wouldn't recommend it to any visitors to the area. The prices didn't match the quality."}
{"text":"The food is decent, nothing spectacular but it's not bad. Garlic fry bread is delicious. However, this is quite possibly the worst dining experience I've ever had. Service is worse than horrible, there out of basics like plastic cups and napkins. The server has no concern for making things right. They screwed up our pizza that had already taken over 30 minutes to make. Overall this has been a horrible experience and I won't be back. Totally bummer because this place is conveniently located an rarely busy. No soap in the bathrooms either so I'm wondering how the servers and kitchen staff are washing their hands."}
{"text":"Always get delivery and now I live a block away and it still shows up kinda cold. Don't know what crispy means.. but I keep order because it's still really good and it's right down the street."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to delivery pizza, but a year or so ago the quality and service began to slide, orders were wrong, pizza took 30 to 40 minutes longer than they said to deliver (i live 5 min away from store).  
Decided to give them another try and nothing has changed, 2 orders in the last couple of weeks, both late, both cold. Never again"}
{"text":"I saw this place online, so I called for delivery. The girl that took my order was very sweet and friendly. Delivery was fast and food was AMAZING! I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish pizza....went to get it... pizza not there. Told it was probably routed to different location! Seriously! We ate there last week and had horrible service and a nasty beef sandwich. I had Rosati's in Henderson...food was amazing but this location.... unbelievably bad something needs to be done about this place! Rude people and not so great service! 
Couldn't mark ZERO 4 SERVICE!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in the world it is definitely one of a kind. It also is very original it really does taste like Chicago styled pizza. I love this place and so will you try it now."}
{"text":"The best hot sandwiches around! Plenty of sauce and cheese and the bread isn't too hard or too toasted, just right. The pizza is a little pricey, but it's pretty good! I'd say it's worth it. Also the chicken tenders and calzones are decent too. Delivery is pretty fast, but there's also a nice small bar/restaurant atmosphere when eating in, too."}
{"text":"I'm in shock at the horrible customer service I received from the owner Fidell. First, he was rude when I called to put in my delivery order since. He was very annoyed that I called 20 minutes after their opening and constantly interrupted me when I had questions about their types of pizzas. Also, I was told it would be a 45 minute wait when it actually became well over an hour- did I mention I only live 2 miles away?! The big disappointment came when I received my pizza. Not only was the pizza cold but the board it was on was dripping wet causing my dough to be soggy. I called back and was argued with by the owner saying that there was no way it was cold and that the dough was supposed to be soggy- also stating that I didn't know anything because I'm not from Chicago and he proceeded to refuse a replacement, refund, or even a simple apology. I would NOT recommend this location due to horrible service, long wait times, and soggy cold pizza."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this location.   Apparently under new mgmt.  We've been going here every Friday night for years ordering the same thing.   18\" thin crust with 1/4 cheese and 3/4 pepperoni.   They've always done it and we were fine paying for the whole topping.   Now no more, refused to do it, only will do halves even tho we said charge us for the whole topping.  2 managers said no.   So, losing long time customer for the sake of not being flexible.   So stupid.....look forward to Gino's East...."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night, at around 8 30pm. When we entered the business we were the only ones in there. The food is good. Nothing wrong with that. The lady working there though, different story. Not that she's rude or anything of that matter but she made it seem like \"uuugghhh\" why did you guys have to walk in. Not one expression on her face. Its like if she was forced to work that day and hated having to come in."}
{"text":"I've never been to Chicago but I can say these are huge, delicious pizzas! I love the sauce they put on. My cousin said it was a little too much, but I literally ate her extra with a fork! 
Also, the pasta's are cheesy & yummy, good salads and my cousin enjoyed a sandwich they had very much. The staff is friendly & I love the decor. Oh, and you must try their teas, I mixed the green and peach together, and it was literally perfect. 
Also, one odd tidbit, I love their to-go containers, they are wonderful for reuse."}
{"text":"I love to order the cod dinner with fries for lunch.  It always arrived hot and it's delicious.  I don't order it for dinner because they are busier; the delivery takes longer and my fries are always soggy."}
{"text":"Love the food but huge problem when I pulled up the website and menu for the specific location and read my order he had no idea what I was asking for and asked what I was looking at. I stated the menu form yelp took me to your website i even picked the specific location too, then  he said we don't have any of the kinds so the 5 items I intended on ordering we're not available at all. Very disappoint not to include I sound like a person that didn't have a clue what I was ordering. He kept saying your looking at the wrong menu and I clearly was not.  Very frustrated. So moral of the complaint don't prepare your order b4 ordering cause its completely wrong. Really ?!??!?!?"}
{"text":"Thought it was a low blow for Rosati's to post signs all over Mama Mias windows \"they are closed..but we are open, come visit us\"...I won't be visiting a restaurant that stoops so low. I suggest you avoid them, too."}
{"text":"I had the pan pizza with sausage and it was soggy the dough was almost soupy. We also got an italian beef and it was bland. We didn't eat any of our food and just made something at home. We will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  AWESOME STAFF... Recommend you check it out been goimg there for months never had a bad experience. . The Ladies that work there are outstanding ."}
{"text":"Because of Groupon and the recent reviews, I decided to give them a try. I used to live in Morton Grove, so I have eaten at the Rosati's in Skokie (outside of Chicago), as well as Giordano's, Lou's, Gino's, and every other legit Chicago pizza place.

I ordered my 'Chicago Style' pizza, Cheef sandwich, and cannoli at 6:13pm and was told 30 minutes. I arrived at 6:50pm, hoping to run in, grab my food, and return home to watch football. After paying and waiting 10 minutes, I asked on the status of my order. It was at that point I was told the pizza had another 10 minutes... would have been nice to know when I paid, eh? I left with my food at 7:26, 73 minutes after my order.

I tried to put this out of mind while I sat down to eat. Unfortunately, the food just made it all worse.

My Cheef sandwhich was dry as a bone (perhaps from sitting for 73 minutes in the heater?), even after explicitly asking for it to be \"dunked\", because I am from Chicago and that is what we do. The beef was so dry and salty I felt like I was eating jerky! I took a few bites, drank a lot of water, and moved onto the pizza.

I was so surprised about the \"Chicago Style\" pizza being thiner than a dominos pizza (approx. 1/4\") that I called them back to inquire about it. Apparently their \"Deep dish\" pizza is the Chicago Style I expected. Their 'Chicago style' pizza is some pan style pizza. If you want Chicago style, order the \"Deep dish\".

The Pizza was OK, but not gourmet. I may try again and this time order the 'Deep dish' - if I do I will update.

The cannoli was weak and not made from scratch.

Overall, had I payed full price I would have been very upset!

In the mean time, I think they should remove the 'Chicago style' pizza as an option because that is what the 'Deep dish' is."}
{"text":"It's been great every time we've gone. Amazing wings, great pizza and salad. I was really surprised to see they had such bad reviews. And, in fact didn't want to go, but my fianc√© said it was great and he didn't see how they had such bad reviews because he got stuff there often. Most of the bad reviews are from people who are pissed because they couldn't get discounts when they didn't bring in their coupon.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Last night was my first and last time visiting Rosatis. Too bad because the food was actually very good. I came in and ordered  to take out and while my pizza was ready in an acceptable time of 20 minutes the sandwhich and garlic bread  took another 20 minutes. All the while my pizza was sitting getting cold. The clerk kept saying \"just a few more minutes\". Clearly the kitchen staff is not trained on timing so all orders are ready around the same time. They are certainly good at socializing with each other because that is what they were doing instead of completing my order. The restaurant was not busy so they cant use that as an excuse. If you go here, only order one item because they cant handle multiple things."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered pasta, and we both ended up with food poisoning, the sauce was super salty and, something was cross contaminated or under cooked for as sick as we both ended up."}
{"text":"It's all about the thin crust people!!  I love this pizza it's nummy nummy!  Besides this place and secret pizza at the Cosmo I can't  have pizza from anywhere else because all the rest suck in this town except for one other. Someone complained about the thin crust on here. How dare you!  It's the best! The sauce is what makes this pizza. I just had the spaghetti and that was also good. Made a phone order, did have to wait as another person commented. But good things come...you know the rest :)"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza chain in Arizona!  I'm from Chicago and was thrilled to see that Rosati's made their way out to Arizona.  If you're looking for a good combo on your pizza, try italian beef and giardiniera."}
{"text":"The pizza was phenomenal it was everything you can expect from a pizza; althought, the customer service wasn't the best of all. Their mood was displesent but was subdued by the incredibly pleasant taste of the pizza, this is now my favorite pizza joint in las vegas right above Joe's pizza. This pizza joint also has a nice environment inside with a 90's new York style and warm (because NY is cold). Phenomenal Bar as well a close distance from where I live."}
{"text":"This place used to be owned by really cool people who brewed their own delicious beer and made good food. Now it's owned by people who don't  know what's on their own menu or the names that coincide with each dish. The food used to be pretty amazing, but now it is underwhelming and hardly deserving of being described as mediocre. I took a friend there not realizing things had changed, but thought I'd give it a try anyway. I could have gotten better white sauce out of a jar. Had I realized how bad their food was, I would have. Their cheesy breadsticks are simply a frozen breadstick baked with a string cheese in the middle. Those were good, but hardly worth the price. And it took FOREVER to get our food (it was a to go order). Utterly disappointing. The restaurant was clean and the people were not rude, but that's about the only positive thing that can be said."}
{"text":"We occasionally ( ok, more than occasionally) like to order delivery.  What is a working woman to do! 

Rosati's is one of two non-chain local places that will deliver.  They do a decent job and have a nice thin crust pizza (but no where near NY style).  Recently we have decided to try the calzones which are chock full of toppings.  Great flavor and we always also order ranch to vary the dipping options.  The sauce is really good too.  

Their delivery drivers are always personal, in fact one brings doggie treats for our pups.  Class A operation all around!  Only negative is that when we order for delivery they always say \"it will be there within the hour.\"  This is kind of a cop-out.  We never really know when it will get there, it is always a guess, although they don't lie...it is there within the hour :0)"}
{"text":"I guess I should have checked the Yelp reviews before we came as opposed to looking at them while at the restaurant waiting for our pizza. First let me say, the only place I've ever had great Chicago-style pizza is actually in Chicago. The Chicago-style pizza here was ok but definitely not comparable to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's. The pizza should recieve 3 stars, and the breadsticks served before meal should be 4 stars, but the service should really only be 1 star.
We walked in and the 2 girls at the front didnt even say \"hi\". I had to ask if we seat ourselves and she then says \"no, how many?\". She takes us to our table and then drops off menu and walks away. I don't think she was rushing anywhere important as there was only 1 other table eating inside. 
Once we recieved our pizza, she didn't stop back until I was well into my 3rd piece...I then asked for a box and she dropped check off. She was quick to come back to get paid but that was her only moment of urgency our entire meal.
I don't think I'll be back to this location. I get takeout from the Silverado Ranch location, you can't dine-in there but the carry-out experience is a much more pleasant one..."}
{"text":"Haven't tried this place for a few years. Was worse than I had remembered. Thin crust was soaking wet and toppings were haphazardly placed with no consistency. Also way over priced"}
{"text":"I lived in Chicago for 15 years and when I left for California, I just couldn't find really good pizza. Now that I am in Glendale, I found Rosatis, and I can get that Chicago style pizza that is like \"home\".

The crust is authentic, as are the tomato's on top. In some places, if you get vegis on it, the excess water will make the crust soaked, but not here. Perfect. 

I think they are a bit expensive, which keeps me from giving it 5 stars, but otherwise, amazing."}
{"text":"My Rosati Pizza deep dish was great.  Lots if cheese and large chunks of sausage. YUM!  I will return. Next I'll try out their ribs.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"A couple of co-workers and I decided to stop in because we heard that they were doing a pizza buffet lunch at this location. We arrived 25 minutes before the lunch buffet was going to shut down. As we sat down we were assured by the waiter that they were making more pizzas and there would be enough. True to his word they did eventually make enough pizzas and we left after our fill. 

BUT that was not enough to overcome my biggest gripes about the experience. 

1. When you go to a buffet type experience you expect there to be food on the buffet.. 

Having to fight with other patrons over pizza slices is not a fun thing. It just sets up the unpleasant situation where your fighting for every slice and then the whole pizza is gone in 60 seconds. And really, who doesn't hate the douche bag who takes more than one slice in this situation.

2. Rosati's is known for their deep dish Chicago pizza, but they don't serve it on the buffet.

Wow, I asked about this one and they said that they can't justify the cost of putting deep dish on the buffet. WHAT? Why even bother to do the buffet if your going to be cheap about it. If we had known that before we started eating, we would have just ordered a pie and skipped the buffet.  Up the price a couple of bucks per person and put the deep dishes out, I would gladly pay it. 

3. The buffet itself was kinda sparse. I probably would not have noticed it except for I was waiting for pizza. There was salad, only two types of dressing, some pasta, sauces, meatballs and Italian sausages. They have a huge menu, it just felt limited.

Now the food was good and the service was attentive, but take my advice order delivery until they fix this."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best experiences! The monster pizza is sooo good! The staff at this location are super nice and helpful, I know where I'm gonna be getting pizza from for game nights now! I recommend it FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Ughh so disappointed usually this place isn't too bad but after yesterday never again. $50 of delivery ordered and never to be heard of again. After promised an hour wait at the most, with 2 hours passed and closing time approaching, we tried contacting them several times only to be directed to voice mail each time. At this point almost 10pm (closing time), starving, and not willing to be dismissed, my husband drove to Rosatis 10 minutes prior to closing time to see what happened. He walks in to find 2 employees chatting and hanging out. They claimed they were \"swamped\". No offer to discount/comp anything, or sincere apology. Mediocre food. Definitely not worth it and will never be providing our business to Rosatis again!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, salad was pretty good but didn't have much lettuce. Pizza was cut abnormally, not often I've seen a pizza that is round cut into square-ish pieces. We made a special request for the delivery guy to wish our 3yo a happy birthday but he didn't. :( Not sure if we will order again. Mostly because pizza is ok and they don't honor the special requests, what's the point?!

Overall, I would rate above average pizza place."}
{"text":"Their pizza is a joke! They advertise \"Chicago style\" pizza but they clearly know nothing about it. After waiting over an hour for our delivery, I opened the box to discover the most pathetic pizza I have ever seen. The crust was extremely thin and dry-more like a burned cookie. Presentation was awful! Whoever cut the pizza cut some sample sized pieces that were embarrassing to serve to family and friends that we were visiting. The manager did nothing to remedy the situation. In fact, he agreed that one would find a better value in a frozen, grocery store pizza. Extremely rude! Do NOT eat here!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at rosaties. Today I got one if my usuals, the cheef, it's Italian beef with giardinara, topped with perfectly melted mozzarella, and dipped in au jus. The cheef is AMAZING. My only other \"usual\" here are their ribs and they are always perfect."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!!! WORST SERVICE, EVER! We waited 55 minutes for our delivery, which was supposed to only take 30 minutes. We live 7 minutes down the road. We called to find out where our delivery was, they said they were \"on the way\"... No apologies, no \"let me find out where the driver is and I will call you back,\"....Well, when they FINALLY delivered our italian beef sandwich it had the au jus spilt all over the bag. The other au jus didn't even have a lid and was also spilt, there was about 1/4 of it left. The sandwich was disgustingly soggy. They completely forgot our salad. When we called, we spoke to the manager who said they would give us $1.00 back for the salad, and would send us another sandwich, but refused to refund us. We didn't want another sandwich, we wanted our money back by this point. We even said we wanted our money back because this was disgusting and there was no way we wanted to eat a soggy sandwich!! WHYYY would we want to wait ANY LONGER for another order?? We wanted our money back so we could get the sandwich we wanted from someplace we know has good service. NEVER will I EVER go here, ever again!"}
{"text":"Very bad puzza. Note spelling. Asked for NO GREEN PEPPERS after a long wait here comes the puzza. Green peppers all over it. Answer...that's how it comes. Tried to pick off but still tasted like papers anyway. Meat was poor quality and cheese was old. Will never go back. Junk puzza"}
{"text":"Ok. I have been a lover of Chicago Deep Dish pizza for many years. I know how it is supposed to be done. I recently relocated to Madison Wi. I was over joyed to find that there was a Rosatis near me. So I figured I would give them a try. I ordered a 12 inch Chicago Deep Dish. The staff was very helpful with me picking out my size so I did not over order. When the pizza got here I couldn't was to dig in. It looked amazing. They must use some butter in the crust. It was the best Chicago pizza I have had in a long time. I will definitely be ordering from here a lot!!  I give them five stars cause there wasn't ten!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for their $5 special, one slice of pizza with a soda. This Rosati's is carryout only. The man behind the desk put in one slice in a box. When I got home and opened the box I found the slice totally dried up and lukewarm.The outside crust was pretty brown, but not totally burnt. The crust tasted like cardboard.Perhaps if the slice was fresh instead of crispy, dried up cheese on top and heated up it might have been okay tasting. I didn't think it was worth the ride back to return it (although the two employees seemed pleasant). I threw it out and will not return again."}
{"text":"Great pizza ...I love the sauce!!!  The wings are huge and tasty.  Even the salad is good and who rates salad?  The sweet italian dressing is sooo good!  This was my first time trying but I will definetly be going back !"}
{"text":"An hour and twenty minutes for a $25 lg thin crust pizza.  Time to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Such a ripoff!!  This pizza is not worth half the price they're charging for it. A large cheese thin crust pizza is 20 bucks.   Do yourself a favor and check out Sal's Pizza in Tempe.  It is far more delicious and a much better value. Eek! Methinks not."}
{"text":"I have ordered Rosati's for quite some time now from my work due to them accepting Value Card which is why we order from them. We have never had any problems (minus having to wait quite a bit longer than what was told our pick up times would be) until the other day. I had a pretty large order totaling about $175.00. Everything was great, went to pick up the food and everything was actually ready on time. The cashier went over the receipt and made sure all the food was there. Drove the 10 miles back to work, started to undo the bags (which are stapled shut) and what do you know, there is a Rosatis salad missing along with a second side salad we had. Upon opening the pizza box, one of the pizzas was supposed to have been thin crust but all of the pizza was regular crust. I called Rosatis back immediately, the cashier talked to the cook who admitted to making the pizza normal crust. Also we sere charged for \"double dough\" on the meat mania pizza, however we did not ask for a double dough, but it was also just made with a regular crust. I asked if we would get a credit for this and the cashier said she cant offer a credit so i requested to speak to the manager. The manager (Javier) got on the phone, i explained again what happened. He was willing to only give a $20.00 credit for the inconvenience. There were two salads missing and 2 incorrect pizzas. The pizzas we ordered were more than $20.00 each. I didn't understand why they would give less credit than what the value of what I ordered. I asked since they are crediting me less, they should step up their customer service and deliver the food that was made incorrectly and not even given to me period due to the inconvenience. Javier then said \"oh god, are you serious?\" I have never had such horrible treatment from a manger, Javier then said he was not the manager. I asked to just speak with the manager and Javier said \"fine how about a $30.00 credit.\" Finally after requesting for a good minute to speak with the manager Javier then said there was no manager there and told me that the managers name is Johnny but wouldn't be in until the evening. I do no understand how this company can have such horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Yeah, so...umm....this place sucks. Dead empty and a chicken parm sandwhich is gonna take 20 minutes. Still waiting while highschool kids move as slow as snails. Actually, that's an insult to snails. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I had friends in town from Chicago this month, and they saw the Rosati's and wanted to try it, being long time customers of the chain back home. This place was good once, but had really gone downhill in the last year or so. After agreeing reluctantly, I ordered a Chicago style deep dish combo for pick-up. The guy on the phone sounded very enthusiastic when I told them I wanted to impress my Chicago friends and assured me the pizza would be ready in 35-40 minutes.

When I arrived precisely at 35 minutes, prepared for the usual wait,  the pie was literally coming out of the oven. The guy at the counter, Patrick, was all smiles and \"How are you doing, Phil?\" like he knew me-so clearly he was new. We chatted for a moment as he opened up the box and showed me the pie (something no place has done for me before, and I must say, I really like) and it looked perfect.

He offered me cheese and red pepper packets (something they were nearly always out of in the past) and gave me a new menu and a sheet of coupons for next time. I remarked that what had happened here because the food and service were night and day different from what I was used to. \"We've made some changes here, and if you have any problems with your pizza, you can call and ask for me personally and I will take care of it for you. Let me know how your friends like it.\" he said, and shook my hand.

The pie was fabulous, and a big hit with my guests \"exactly like Rosati's back home\", and I have to say, so was the service. If this is how they \"changed\" things, bravo-I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were craving Italian and thought we would try this place. When we got there the waitor took our order as he was starring at the tv. We ordered two simple dishes, a cheese ravioli and an Italian sub and waited over 20 minutes just to get the food. We were the only two sitting there the entire time and the waitor said they were backed up, understanding that they do takeout but there was no need for that long of a wait. The cheese ravioli if that's what you call it was missing half the cheese in the center and the marinara sauce tasted as if it was old. The Italian sub was mainly a huge piece of bread with four slices of meat and some tomatoes and green peppers thrown on top. We were not impressed with this so called Italian restaurant.  They either need to get better cooks or a better menu because they just lost my business permanently.  Remember word of mouth is a powerful thing."}
{"text":"I know it's a pizza place - but I have to say, I've never actually eaten pizza there. For me, this is where I go when I have a craving for a Chicago-style hot dog and can't make a run down I-90 to Portillo's. They use yummy Vienna Beef dogs (of course), topped with the usual condiments. (Cute side note: they make mention of ketchup on the menu - that it doesn't belong on a Chicago dog, but they'll do it if they have to.)

The place is not fancy - a few booths, red checkered tablecloths. The service is friendly, but not overbearing. (Food, refills, and check arrived exactly when they should.) I'll be back. And one day, I hope to check out their location in Tucson!"}
{"text":"Doubt I will be back. We've gone here for years but lately haven't been as we got a little tired of it. Ordered pizza tonight and was looking forward to some Rosati's again: a large, thick crust with pepperoni and green bell peppers and then asked for the free cheese pizza w/thin crust. We got both as thick crust and with the sauce ON TOP of the pizza. Not only did it look wholly unappealing, it was rather disgusting. Had to pretty much peel off all the cheese as it was WAY too thick. Left with crust which I then pieced back together with half the cheese...but without sauce (it's hard to smear that back on)...let's just say the result was not too pretty. They obviously forgot to put the sauce on BOTH of our pizzas and decided to throw it on at the end. With plenty of other options, I will go elsewhere from here on out."}
{"text":"The service here is TERRIBLE. Absolutely terrible. Every time we order for delivery or pick up they mess the order up horribly. The first time we completely got someone else's order. We are ordering for a dental office so we do not have the luxury of sending it back and waiting for them to get our order correct the second time. First, no one really cared but about an hour later we got a call from the manager giving us a credit to our account. 
When we went to use the credit, it was nowhere to be found of course. 
We order one last time because the food is pretty good. Again, the charming service messed up the order. They charge extra for french fries, no big deal so we all paid extra and NO ONE got fries. When I called back to ask why we were charged for something and not given it--they did not care and then preceeded to HANG UP ON ME. 
People make mistakes but come on, every time we order?! Nothing bugs me more than wasting my money by overpaying for NOTHING. Especially getting hung up on because the people running the joint could not care less about anyone but themselves.
I WILL NEVER COME TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN AND I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS THE EMPLOYEES ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD. I would be fired at my own job for the way these people treat their customers."}
{"text":"I usually don't bother writing a review on \"quick\" food types of places because I usually feel pretty neutral about it, kind of like just whatever... But it was late, like 10:30 and I was desperately craving a meatball sandwich. This place was the only place open AND on the plus side they delivered so I gave it a shot. I didn't expect much, just wanted anything with meatball and marinara (I get these cravings you know) and I ordered a meatball sandwich and the breaded mushrooms. First let me say the girl who took my order was very sweet and didn't seem bothered by my late ordering and not knowing the menu (especially considering her shift was probably coming to an end) and second the delivery was VERY fast considering they've never been here and it's really hard to find because there's no sign that says the name of my apartments and the address number is no where to be found on the building either (it's a small place tucked behind a few business and houses, sometimes I wonder how I even get my mail) anyways.. The sandwich was great, I figured end of night I was probably going to get the last of whatever's been cooked already but to my surprise it tasted very fresh. Most of all I was impressed with the meatballs, I'm usually disappointed with most meatballs from most places, but was thrilled to find that these were good ones. They were big, hearty, and tasted like they are homemade. Even if they are not, they are better than most, that's for sure. The sandwich had just enough sauce, not too much to where the sandwich was too messy & to soggy. Enough to where I could eat the whole thing with my hands (like a sandwich should be eaten) and without the sauce & insides falling out all over the place. I was not too impressed with the mushrooms because they were watery when I but into them & kind of bland. But that meatball sandwich was so freakin awesome that I might actually just start ordering them again, from here obviously, because I know I won't be disappointed and on top of that they are only $6 bucks. That is a smokin deal for this one and I can tell you it blows subway out of the water. Next time I'm feeling \"meatball\" anything I'm going to order from here, maybe try something new next time but definitely something with meatballs. They really nailed it! Yay!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Rosati's MANY times in Wisconsin, and having just moved to the area, was SUPER excited to see that there was one near me!  I read the previous reviews, even the negative ones, and thought \"surely those negative comments cannot be true!\"  Sadly....I was wrong.  Here is why:

Order: Super stuffed pizza with extra cheese, garlic, green peppers, onions; chicken salad (I know....but it was for my girlfriend!!); Breaded mushrooms.

Deliver time was over an hour and 20 mins....but if you KNOW Rosati's, you know you pay a little more, wait a little longer....but the food is SO worth it!!!

FOOD: Under cooked. I have ordered the super stuffed pizza many times....with more toppings...and it has usually been delivered hot, crusty, gooey....PERFECT.  But there is a difference between a crunchy crust with a chewy center and simply being undercooked.  THIS was undercooked....the crust was still dough and the center was cool, with the cheese not completely melted.  The breaded mushrooms were the same....the breading was very thick and not completely cooked (the batter was still batter inside and the mushrooms were cool). I did not finish either the mushrooms OR the pizza...and trust me, I ALWAYS finish my food!  I ate two pieces and my girlfriend had to try to heat it in the oven........kinda defeats the purpose.

The chicken salad....? Seriously...who cares. Unless you have a fitness buff girlfriend, you won't order a chicken salad from ROSATI'S....and if she is a fitness buff she obviously won't care what it tastes like.

What got my goat the most was when I called back.  The lady on duty told me that sometimes in the delivery process, things can get soggy. Then she offered me a \"partial credit\".  Serious ROFL's on that.... Ma'am, I am a serious food orderer.  I have ordered all kinds of foods from all kinds of places....I KNOW when it is soggy and when it is undercooked. 

BOTTOM LINE: I had come to trust Rostati's (as a franchise) and am perfectly aware that sometimes, things can happen (even though it has never happened at any of the Rosati's I ordered from in WI or the one up in Peoria....I cannot speak for other Rosati's over here).  I will, of course, use my partial credit and try them again, and naturally, will update this post (for good or bad) when I do!  I just hope none of the cooks reads this first and does something naughty to my food!!! Just sayin."}
{"text":"I actually really like the pizza here. However, the prices are high as hell here compared to other Rosati's in the valley. I order the thin crust pizza and I usually end up waiting an hour to get the pizza delivered to my door. I really enjoy Rosati's and I really wish this wasn't the one near my house, because the price and service really sucks."}
{"text":"It's Super Bowl Sunday & of course the phones are busy. I'm on hold for a bit, but then Andy, the night closing manager, hops on the phone & is just so friendly & helpful. He explains the specials to me & takes my order & reads it back to me not missing a single one of my picky details. I have ordered from here a few times (on my cheat day) and never had bad service, but Andy... was just great! He even assured me my pizza would be here with in the hour... On Super Bowl Sunday! Thank you Andy!"}
{"text":"This place has the most disgusting food. I ordered dinner through Uber Eats last night. Their so called family recipe lasagna not only looked awful but was old and smelled spoiled. It clearly was frozen and microwaved. The sad little meatball that I ordered with it was black on the top and gray on the bottom. I didn't even taste it after tasting the foul lasagna. Their fried zucchini where greasy discs that had old coating and was so salty you couldn't eat it. Maybe that was their secret ingrient to cover disgusting. The cheese garlic bread was a sandwich loaf that had salty garlic butter spread on it with a slice of white cheese that was microwaved to melt. Save your money and stay away from this downhill restaurant."}
{"text":"Was one of my all time fave pizzas, and that's coming from a New Yorker. Over the last couple of years there's been a decline in quality and consistency. Most glaring is the use of canned mushrooms and not fresh ...  That's a huge no no for pizza ... ruins the moisture balance and makes a thin crust soggy, even when well done. Breaded mushrooms are fantastic though."}
{"text":"I'd like to think that I caught this restaurant on a bad night.  I live around the corner from this Rosati's location and have been looking forward to trying their pizza.  

On January 18th we ordered a large thin crust pizza but what was delivered had all the wrong toppings and a \"crust\" that can only be compared to a cardboard box.  We called to complain but the woman who answered the phone apparently couldn't hear us and hung up.  We drove with the nearly untouched pizza to the restaurant to exchange it for something else.  When we arrived we were greeted by a manager who was less than sympathetic.  We were expecting an apology but instead he questioned whether we ordered the pizza from the Rosati's website or Grub Hub.  We showed him that half of the pizza we ordered had none of the toppings we ordered and described the unpleasant crust. He agreed to make us a \"double dough\" pizza which he described as a \"regular pizza\" and refund the complete cost of our order.  The \"double dough\" crust was a thicker version of the thin crust; tasteless, overcooked and stale.  The toppings were correct but there just weren't enough of them.  The pizza looked more like a homemade pizza than one made by a restaurant that's been specializing in Chicago style pizza since 1964.  What's worse, it's been over two weeks and we have yet to receive the refund. 

I was also turned off by the employee area being in full view of both the dine in and carry out areas.  Several employees were enjoying food, drinks and taking their break in full view of the paying customers.  I have no objection to these activities but I think it should be hidden from paying customers.

I would not recommend Rosati's to anyone and I won't be back myself, there are several better options around town."}
{"text":"So this is my second time getting pizza from rosati's delivered. I got the deep dish a couple of weeks ago. It came in about an hour. It was hot and it looked good....but it was bland and way too cheesy. The crust was good though. Tonight, we got the thin crust. It was the same experience. Too much cheese, almost no sauce and it was bland. I gave it two stars because I liked the crust."}
{"text":"Try the Italian fried chicken...best IFC I have had in years.

I purchased the 4 piece and it came with slaw, bread stick, wing/leg/thigh/breast and a pound of fries...packaged up nice in a VERY high quality to-go box.

The flavor was perfect....the chicken was super moist and the outside was super crunchy.

I know nothing about the pizza pie, but the chicken is unquestionable!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for $15 for $30. The groupings have a one shot kind of deal. For two people $30 goes a long way. My husband and I bought a 12\" pan pizza half pepperoni and half cheese, cheese ravioli and Rosati's grinder. I had the pizza last night. My only issue is there's no markers on top of the cheese to let you know the difference between the halves. The pizza was excellent. Super cheesy and the dough was just the proper thickness. I could have you some garlic butter dip for the crust since there's so much but I don't think they offer it. My husband ate his grinder last night. He thought it was awesome. Beware it is pretty spicy. I had the ravioli for lunch. It was good but the amount of sauce was a little unnecessary. The breadstick that comes with it has lots of spices on top and was really good too. Overall, I thought it was excellent!  Totally recommend it and I plan on going back."}
{"text":"Great food although not quite as good as some other locations. Love the fact that you can get individual slices of pizza any time. :)"}
{"text":"Many TV sets. Feel of a neighborhood place. Very friendly and accommodating. Thin and thick pizza. Menu for children. Owner greets us each time."}
{"text":"This rating is based on service ONLY. We continue to have the worst service from this location. We used to order delivery from here but stopped due to multiple incorrect orders and long wait times. Since it's so close to our home, we opted to start calling in for pickup. That strategy had been working fine until two nights ago. We called to place our order at 5:45pm and were told it would be ready for pickup in 20 minutes. AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER we finally had our order and were able to go home and eat. When we arrived for pickup, we were told our appetizer and salad were ready and they were \"waiting on the pizza to be done.\"  We waited and waited and waited.....to add insult to injury, the following things happened (or didn't) during our wait:

- There were less than 5 people eating inside the restaurant so it wasn't overly busy. 
- Multiple other orders (pickup and delivery) were sent out in front of us. 
-  They tried to give us the wrong pizza. 
-  We had to listen to the kitchen staff argue and throw blame at each other about why our pizza never even got made. 
- The manager NEVER came out to check on us, offer drinks or apologize. 

We finally decided to ask for our money back and leave. They assured us it would only be another 10 minutes for our pizza and, if we waited, they would comp the whole order. We decided to wait and they brought the pizza to us 15 minutes later and had refunded our money. 

The food is really good but it will be a long time before we order from there again."}
{"text":"After 10 years as loyal customers we might be done. Rosati's is very expensive but we've always been happy to pay, and willing to wait the one hour (sometimes longer) for our pizza. 

We ordered a pepperoni and a sausage pizza, and received 2 sausage pizzas. Normally, no big deal, stuff happens. When I called Rosati's the person who answered put me on hold and when she came back she told me the manager \"Andrew\" had cooked and boxed our pizzas himself, and was sure he had done it correctly, so there we be no compensation nor another pizza. Seriously? I'm lying?  I offered to send them pictures, which led to an awkward silence. Finally, I got this Andrew fella on the phone. I explained the situation and was told it normally takes an hour and fifteen minutes, but he would rush the order. When I asked when I should expect the replacement pizza, he got indignant and explained it took 20 minutes to cook it, etc. then hung up on me. 

In fairness the replacement pizza showed up in 30 minutes - and the delivery driver explained \"my manager wants you to open it and confirm it's correct\", which I did. 

With Slice, Grub Hub, and Door Dash, the options are no longer limited. It's not worth being told I'm a liar for very expensive pizza I've been ordering for a decade. And I won't be put through the ringer for The Great Andrew. They've lost focus - and a 10 year customer, who will now spend his money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terrible Chicago style pizza.  Crust not fully cooked, extra toppings appeared to be added after cooking (toppings cold, pizza warm.). Very little cheese and despite asking for light sauce/tomatoes pizza was mostly tomato.  Very little flavor.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Tried 5 times now and never better.  Always soggy in the middle.  Ordered pie cut hoping it'd be better than the squares.. Nope still wet and soggy in the middle.  Sad because taste is there just underdone, wet and soggy.  Last time for us and at $70 for 2 pies no thx"}
{"text":"Good food, but don't buy dessert... the cheesecake isn't worth over 4 bucks for only two mouthfuls. Manager didn't even attempt to make it right."}
{"text":"Yummy food and a wonderful family friendly atmosphere! Will definitely be ordering again soon! Price matches the quality"}
{"text":"We decided to try this location due to having a restaurant.com discount coupon.  I had never been to any Rosati's locations, so this was a first.  It was a Friday evening, so just about all the tables were full and others were waiting for their take out, so, it seemed like a good thing that this many people come for their food.  The staff was working hard to accommodate everyone and even though they were quite busy, they were helpful in getting our order and getting our food to us in a reasonable amount of time.
We ordered fried mushrooms, chicken wings (mild), and a large 4 topping thin crust pizza (sausage, mushrooms, olives, and bell peppers).  The fried mushrooms were tasty and cooked properly, the wings were hearty in size and even the mild sauce had a nice zing to it.  The pizza was large and cut into small square pieces that made eating it pretty easy.  It was quite tasty!  
Knowing what to expect and how the food is now, I would certainly come back here and be willing to try other Rosati's locations."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are for Rosati's! They offer 1/2 off pizzas including their Chicago deep dish which is HUGE!! 
They have an awesome happy hour as well including $3 mozzarella sticks, $5 hot wings ( different sauces too!) 
We didn't get the name of our server but he was super friendly and helpful! 
If you're looking to take the family out to eat without spending a lot check out Rosati's ~ great service, food and specials a 4star better than most!"}
{"text":"Called to order take out and the girl I talked to didn't even know the menu.  Ended up getting what we thought was going to be garlic knots according to the menu but ended up with dried out pizza crust.
Wouldn't recommend ordering from this location."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed in the service. Wanted to order pizza delivery and after being told 30 min we waited over an hour only to call and find the order was not placed and it would be another 45 min.  Most places would comp a pizza with a screw up like that. Only off r ed 15% off."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at this restaurant this week.  While I love Roasti's pizza....the service was not good.  Slow to take our order, food served at various times, etc.  The server was not kind or gracious.  I wish this was not the case.  Maybe over time the service will improve but our experience was not good."}
{"text":"Not all Rosati's are created equal. Some are franchised and others are independently owned. This one is not a franchise. Those I had tried before were and I was never a fan. I'm still not sold on the thin crust. I find it too bland. However, their best pizza isn't even on the menu. It's a special order and special is the keyword. Dine in and order a stuffed pizza. There will be a 45 minute wait but you will be in for a treat (buttery crust and gooey cheese galore). The flavors packed in this pie bring me back to Chicago with each bite. It's wonderful. 

We've tried it from delivery (as pictured) and it was still mighty tasty, but the crust wasn't as crisp. I definitely recommend dining in."}
{"text":"I love Rosatis but this location has major problems! Since the deep dish takes 45 minutes, we ordered 2 appetizers to munch on while we waited, both were served barely warm. Then when we got our pizza it was barely warm...I went to the DIRTY bathroom and the toilet would not flush. i took off the tank lid and there was no chain to pull up the flapper! Would recommend going to a different location. For a Saturday night it was dead in there and now I know why!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza but way overpriced. I would eat here more often if they lowered the prices, but in the meantime I will continue to just enjoy it every few months or so.  It also takes a long time for the order to be ready and often times I've had to sit and wait even when I showed up at the time they said it would be ready."}
{"text":"We have just \"discovered\" this Rosati's. We are very impressed with the quality and freshness of the food from the fresh salads through the pastas.
The warm, friendly atmosphere only sets the tone for great service, food, and good value.
We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Rosati's is disgusting. The food there is so unsanitary because they use moldy and unbaked food and think it is acceptable?? What a joke! 

Also the waits there are insane!! One time it took an hour to get my pizza delivered when it could have taken 5 minutes just to walk there which is horrible. And that has been the case multiple times!!

Also, 
I'm leaving. Yall dumb. And DONT EAT AT ROSATIS it's gross and unsanitary. I know for a fact... I know someone who works there."}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native I've searched all of Las Vegas to find some Chicago style foods ... I found Hot Dog Heaven ...which was good because i just began my search ... then I found Chicago Dogs and I was hooked on them for a long time but it was way out of my way but worth the ride ... and then I moved ... and found Rosati's it was perfect deep dish pizza but then they CLOSED ... no notice at all ... I had pizza hut that night ... I found my next Rosati's on Silverado Ranch ... and they were consistent as the wigwam location the pizza was great ... I will request my pizza cut in squares next time ... but i gotta try the Italian Beef next ... I recommend Rosati's for deep dish Chicago style pizza ... you won't be disappointed and you wont have to eat pizza hut"}
{"text":"If you want true Chicago style pizza, this is the place to go!

Fresh food and true chicago customer service. I felt I was back in the windy city!

Pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place . Had a few problems with delivery times but pizza is delicious. I also like their unique deal. Buy one Large get a Medium cheese for free."}
{"text":"There pizza is amazing:) BUT there customer service sucks. Especially if your calling in to order. I was on hold for 8 mins then when she came back on the phone she asked what I needed? I said I need to order for delivery she said ok hold on AGAIN??? I heard her talk to another employee about the money count. That couldn't wait till she got my order after having me on hold for 10 mins already:( would highly recommend the pizza! It's the only reason I stayed on hold for so long. I literally almost hung up and was going to go to little Caesars that's how mad I was:( she got on the phone right when I was going to hang up. Pizza is great thou!!! They just need help on the service!!!"}
{"text":"I order from this place more then 3 times a week, at my house and I order for my employees 2 or 3 times a week and I order the same thing 2 pizza and get the free cheese pizza and wings, I was getting work done on my store yesterday and ordered and the box was dripping and the whole pizza was shifted to the side and we told the driver and they brought a new one out and we ask the driver to wait and we showed him the pizza because the second one was still messed up and he told us he could not take it back we have to call and we ask him can he wait to say he can verify that the second pizza was still messed up, he say yes, my wife went and got the phone and I swear the guy ran out of my store, so when she called back the manager his name was Andrew, he say he was not going to send another pizza out, he said cause they busy he a just add a credit, so today my wife just called because we are having a party at our house tonight and we called to order a couple pizza and they put her on hold for a long time and finally came back to the phone and say they are no longer taking orders and we say okay and she asked are you no longer taking orders for the night or just from us and she said from you, mind you I spend $170 plus a week with this place and this is how you treat some one who spend their hard earn money, you tell us we have a credit and then tell your workers not to take our order, the credit or the money is not a issue, it's the fact how they treat their customers when they run in to a problem, we could of been truthful and all had common sense and knew a problem like this happen doing delivery, but we are not trying to get anybody in trouble, we just wanted our food like everybody else.."}
{"text":"3 Cheese Penta pasta is 10 stars! Something new is going on at the old Rosatis.  Don't expect the bland cheese and same old boring marinara sauce. Have Kyle make you a Nantucket style Cosmo while ya wait. Finally someone is revitalizing that place. So stop in and try it again, ignore the old bad reviews. 

Don't leave without 2 cannoli desserts. 1 won't be enough."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, considering it was delivered.
Sauce is well-balanced and not sweet (a huge plus!).
Cheese seemed to be of high quality.
The thicker crust was not to my personal preference (the in-between of the thin and deepdish).  I did like the thin crust.
I'd definitely order again."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have always loved Rosati's Pizza, but this location ruined getting delivery from them.  We ordered our pizza at 7:10 and it didn't arrive until after 9:00.  I called several times and was told it was on the way.  I was also told they were having some issues with their online ordering service.  The last time, the delivery guy came just as the person on the phone rudely hung up on my husband for calling again.  The pizza, pasta, and sandwich was very cold and inedible.  It's a lot of money to spend on bad service and cold food."}
{"text":"Regardless of the time of day their delivery is always over an hour. On several occasions they have sent the wrong order and the food has arrived cold!"}
{"text":"I have been pretty addicted to this place the last few months and always seem to get a pizza or calzone at least twice a week. I'm a big fan of both the Chicago deep dish and thin crust when it comes to the pizzas. I have experienced pickup issues with the people on the back being on their cell phones when my pizza sat there ready to go."}
{"text":"Not sure why others have had such bad experiences here. This is one of the best pizzas in Arizona. It costs more than the national chains but it is so much better. I love their deep dish sausage pizza. Amazing!"}
{"text":"this place has gone down hill since it changed ownership.   it was a good place before this owner. now the food is over priced,and not that good, just had chicken tenders, next time i will go to mickey-d's around the corner.   new owner is also anti- gun and as everyone knows,  a restaurant can be a target for some nut that hasn't had a good day.  they won't let protect my family and myself in their restaurant, and they can't protect me or you. so to all law abiding, supporters of the u.s. constitution, and the 2nd amendment, america,  stay away from all places that are anti-gun, anti-american.   this is a franchise, don't know if all rosatis are the same, i know this one wasn't some years back."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place for thin crust Chicago style pizza, been getting it here since they opened. Unfortunately the last two or three times it has been disappointing. Either very little sauce, mushy crust, etc.  It's too bad but we will look elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"We ordered an XL 18 inch pizza, half sausage, pepperoni, onion, and green pepper, and half cheese for the kids, requesting that they not sprinkle the oregano/parmesan cheese on the cheese half because the kids do not like it. I can understand a little of it on the cheese side, but needless to say, it was on the entire pizza, and the kids would not eat it. So we had to make an additional trip to Whataburger for the kids, and spend $11, since we live in Scottsdale. So our $24 pizza ended up costing $35, and by the time we got back with the burgers, the pizza was cold and had to be re-heated."}
{"text":"I feel kind of bad giving out my first 1-star review, but hopefully I'll go back and give it another review.  I got a menu from this place in some flier and it's been on my fridge taunting me for the past week or so.  I finally got the pizza craving, and it was conveniently on a Friday when Rosati's offers double coupons, turning a $5 off an order of $20 or more into $10 off.  Definitely not bad, because I think they're a little over-priced and without the coupon/double coupon incentive wouldn't go back.
Anyway, I wasn't surprised that we weren't the only ones wanting pizza on a Friday and had no problem with the 1 hour delivery time quoted for my pizza and salad.  An hour and a half later, the guy shows up with the pizza and no salad.  He won't just say screw it to the salad and adjust the bill because then we're under the necessary $20 mark for the coupon, but he says he'll be right back and it won't take nearly as long as the pizza did.  We settled into the pizza, which turned out to be cold around the edges and lukewarm in the middle, and really soggy.  Not soggy like the thin crust was buckling under the weight of the toppings (though probably that too), but soggy like the crust was sitting under wet toppings for way too long and it just turned into mush.  Still, it was fairly tasty for cold and soggy and I could see the potential for a decent pizza.  After 45 minutes there's no salad so we call and ask if it could just be canceled.  She says he's already on the way, so no, but offers us coupons.  I'm guessing more coupons that just came with the pizza.  we explain the shiteous experience and she doesn't sound surprised but doesn't offer to right the situation in anyway either.  Finally the guy came with the salad a little over an hour after his first visit and just under 3 hours after we ordered.  We weren't hungry at that point, but I had the salad the next day for lunch, with leftover pizza crisped up in the oven.  Both were decent.
I emailed Rosati's with what I wrote here because I'm honestly not used to this crappy of service.  If they contact me, I'll try them again and redo this review.  If you're reading this, I guess they haven't yet.
Bottom line:  Probably good pizza, but there's a catch-22 of being overpriced without coupons and overly busy when coupons are offered.  My advice would be to order in or carry out."}
{"text":"When we are in the mood for a great Chicago style pizza, we order from Rosatti's. I don't pretend to know what \"authentic\" Chicago style pizza is, but the stuff you can get from Rosatti's has never failed to elicit astonished demands from friends I serve it to--to know where in the world I bought it.
Delicious pizza, and yes, the storefront on Warm Springs is not impressive, but why should it be? Nobody would go there to eat it, they swing by to pick it up and take it home!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Quality was perfect! The chicken wings are delicious! Specially the mango habanero!"}
{"text":"If you want exceptionally poor service, this is the place to go.  The pizza is good.  They deserve that accolade.  Starting with the guys who answer the phones.  We've had one tell us they don't have coupons when they do.  Another time we heard a guy asking if a customer needed to pay extra for ranch with their wings.  Seriously?  We've seen mis-spellings on their menu board in the restaurant.  And we've asked to use a coupon and were denied because THEY didn't know how to work their computer.  I even spoke to the owner on that one and when she didn't allow it, I told her she had lost a weekly customer.  Didn't seem to care.  (I do.  I love the pizza, but it's the principal of the thing to not do business with a shit company.)  Luckily, we're almost smack dab between this and the other Scottsdale location (different owner, slightly different pizza...)  With all these poor reviews it's high time the owners started doing something about this."}
{"text":"This review isn't based on just one bad night.

First off, the Rosati's chain has been broken down... they're not all alike. This particular restaurants crust is a little soggier (but it's not soggy, it's just not what I grew up with or ate regularly when we lived in Scottsdale.) Also, the sauce is blander.  

This restaurant seems to have a problem with time management.  My husband tells me that he usually has to wait a few minutes past the time they say to be there for the pizza to be ready.  He said it happens more often than not.

We started having really bad customer service a couple weeks ago, though.  

Last week I called in an order, but their internet was down.  It was a bit of a chore for the guy to get the order in because I am in a Rosati's club/program where I get points for dollars spent and they had given me a special Halloween coupon...  I spent $30 and never did get credit for that as it turns out.  Given the night, I am not surprised.  So I'd called in my order and they said to be there between 30-35 minutes.  We got there at 35 minutes from hanging up my phone.  Guy at the front took my money and then went into the back.  .....................................................  He didn't come back!  Right about the time we were wondering, \"what the heck?\" we hear the bald headed  bearded man kind of berating someone in the back.  They had not made our pizza, the guy didn't see the ticket or something.  And we waited.  Waited.  Nobody even came out to tell us they screwed up!  We waited for at least 20 minutes before they brought out the pizza.  He just handed it to me and said to have a good night.  My comment to him was that an apology would have been appropriate.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  He did not seem to understand that making a customer wait for their screw-up was not good business.

Onto last night... I didn't want to give them our business again, but we had a GROUPON we'd already paid for.  I called and placed the order.  They said 25 minutes.  My husband got there at 30 minutes because he didn't want to wait.  His plan backfired.  He had to wait.  He said something to the bald headed bearded guy and apparently my husband got the \"you're crazy\" look that I'd seen the week before.  Husband takes pizza home.  We open box.  HORROR!  Ok, maybe that a bit extreme, but it was gross.  There was a big black pile of burnt crap on the pizza (plus a smaller one just to fuck up more of the pie, I think.)  (I'll post pictures here of the pizza.)  I think it was burned cornmeal, but it was clearly burned onto the pizza.  This means someone took this out of the oven, looked at it, and thought it was good enough to give to a paying customer.  I'm not talking about a little bubble of burned cheese (which, imo, is delicious.)  This was truly unappetizing.  We were starving so each grabbed a piece from the unaffected area and off husband went back to Rosati's.  The bald headed bearded man offered to make a new pizza, but he never apologized.  My husband was offended at the offer because he'd have to wait another half an hour.  When he asked to talk to the manager, the bald headed bearded man said HE was the manager (doubtful, not many business owners will treat a customer who comes to their establishment most every week this way.)   I guess this is the point my husband lost his cool and swore at the guy and  advised other waiting customers to not solicit this business.  

Real shame.  I grew up in the Chicago area.  My first job was at Rosati's.  I've been eating there for 42 years.  Rosati's of Mesa won't get my familys business anymore. When I have a real hankering, I know the one on Shea in Scottsdale is top notch."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this pizza or place.

The crust is very thick and was over cooked I think because it was hard & dark :("}
{"text":"I love this place!! Please read: This rosatis is the best ever, throughout the country. I mean this location has freaky fast delivery and excellent customer service. The prices are in margin of the quantity and quality of the food. Wish they had a sit down place to eat because I think their business would boom! Shout out to Paige P! She is the best! Everyone must try Rosatis!
..."}
{"text":"Customer service is not that great here. I ordered 2 pizzas and they forgot to make one so they kept us waiting. We asked to order a margarita pizza and they acted like they didn't know what that was."}
{"text":"This is great pizza hands down. We used to order the thin crust pepperoni classic and a cheese for the boys every Friday night. That was until we tried the deep dish now we get the 'Monster' . Yes it may cause an early death but you can't eat very much because it is so good, rich and thick. 
They pile on a red sauce that is like chunks of near fresh tomatoes, under the sauce is a beautiful mozzarella that is great and stretchy even after delivery. Lots of meat and olives - amazing pizza. 
The Rosati's near us is only delivery or carry out. Oh, and this is no $5 pizza - you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill.  We were big fans of their sister property, Macianos on Grand Canyon and Russell Rd, but moved closer to Rosati's so began going here.  The last three times we ordered pizza, it was terrible.  (Yes, I'll give a place three times to fix it..before I won't go back).  The pizza was not cooked, the cheese was hardly melted and cold.  The crust (thin) was like the other reviewer said a cracker - a limp one at that.  Spending $20 for a pizza that I had to cook when I got it home because, they just don't get it right ( if I take it back, I get attitude and have to go through the hassle again) is just stupid.  I will not go here again.  My boss often orders pizza for our large department (over 125 employees), I will make sure she does not order from here anymore.  Way to expensive for poor quality and service.  I don't think this place will be open much longer, there is never anyone in there, even during the dinner rush.  Sorry to see you go - you started off great!"}
{"text":"First time in years we had Pizza. They have a place down the street from us. I ate in Italian sit-down joint across the street and it was  joint. Ordered a Margarita pizza, it was amazing, thin crust, great flavor was terrific, it make eating out a pleasure, I will be back! Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery & got a confirmation saying \"45 min to an hour.\" Well after an hour & 15 min we called to make sure they received the order & they said yes it's just coming out of the oven & will be on the way. No apology. I also think they should have called to say it would be late. You would think with such terrible reviews that they would try to work on stuff like that. Guess they're ok with a 2 star rating. Anyways, 30 minutes after calling still no pizza so I called again & was told the drivers car \"broke down\". Shouldn't they have called & told me that?? They said sorry & that I'd get a free pizza next time. Uh, how about you give me a refund! I didn't want our food spat in so I didn't say that. Anyways- 2 hours after we ordered they call & say the driver rang the doorbell. Then he gave about 3 other excuses, so I asked for a refund & said never mind. This place is a joke. Do not give them your business."}
{"text":"Ordered the xtra large 'classic combo' pizza for delivery recently.  Delivery was within the stated timeframe and the pizza was very good.  Did not expect the 'slices' to be squares, but it was tasty, nonetheless!  Bonus: we had leftovers for the next day and the garden salad was very fresh .  Will definitely order from here again.    

The one thing holding me back from giving Rosati's a 5-star rating is because I am originally from NY and nothing beats NY pizza (IMO).  ;-)"}
{"text":"customer service was Amazing and the Pizza is delicious. Brooke was great and willing to make adjustments to our order. Michael was quick and extremely friendly. Will be ordering from here moving forward!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at over 40 pizza places in town. I think this place has the best Chicago style pizza in Vegas. People are friendly and the price with coupons is unbelievable.  Well eat again."}
{"text":"If there was a way to rate less than a 1 star I would. We tried to Place a delivery order today. I don't know if I should be mad or sad for the guy answering the phone. A relative of mine (very high functioning special needs) placed the order with me assisting right near. The order was placed perfectly, clearly, no way anything could be misconstrued. We were quoted a price of almost $120. We expected a good $70-$75 for 2 pizzas and 2 salads, but $120? Wow. That's just the beginning. We called back to verify the order they had & price, the guy- again not sure if should be mad or feel bad- was SO incredibly flustered - he couldn't handle it. What so ever- at all. He ended up hanging up on me repeating \"my boss is telling me to get off the phone, I have to go, I gotta go my boss is yelling\" and ending the call.
The lack of professionalism, customer service etc. just beyond wow. Really. We were more than willing to spend the money, even if it was $120 but to not have the patience to handle ANY customer that calls (doesn't matter that the caller has a minor disability, patience for customers-people- is key in life) Im so very disappointed in this circus of an experience. I'm just not sire exactly what to even say. Patience goes a long way. And some understanding and a couple extra moments out of your day to make someone else's day good is worth it. I'm not sure who the manager is, but I know I would be ashamed if I or my employees ever treated customers as we were treated today. Especially for over $100 order. There was a good possibility of becoming regular customers if the service & food was good. Now we will never be able To even know because we were hung up on & left a group of 12 people hungry expecting an order to arrive."}
{"text":"Food is ok and competively priced.  This is the LAST time for this place.  This is a sit down joint and virtually EVERY time we've eaten here, the management allows screaming kids to take over the place as their trash parents don't give a damn.  There are way too many eat in restuarants to take this b.s. Police up the rowdy out of control kids. Good food, too bad."}
{"text":"Nothing like the Rosati's in Chicago. The pizza was good for the first few times we had it, but we just paid good money for a pizza that was nothing but soggy cardboard. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"Can't get an order right to save their lives and they charge you for items not delivered, say they will credit back the account AND DON'T DO IT!"}
{"text":"The service is sooooo bad.  The pizza tastes great but the service lately has been horrible. Pizza is always late when picking up.  The last pick up I did, I was told \"pizza ready in abt. 30 min.\"  I went into the store after 30 min. and they hadn't even begun to make my pizza. Last two deliveries the driver got lost and we had late and cold pizza. If you get lost, at least call us and tell us you are late. I've talked to the manager, but service doesn't get any better.  Guys you have great tasting pizza. You really need to shake up your service! We used to order from you weekly but not any more."}
{"text":"I don't know why people think Papa Del's is so great. I had never had Rosati's because people said that Papa Del's is so much better. Well, they were wrong. Rosati's deep dish sauce is phenomenal and I have never had so much cheese on a pizza! They are so much better than Papa Del's. I have had Papa Del's at lest ten times and Rosati's once. I will never have Papa Del's again."}
{"text":"SO glad they reopened this restaurant.  I have tried other area pizzas, and no one makes them as well as Rosati's.  You can tell the difference in the ingredients, especially the sauce, the sausage, the peppers, the cheese. I love the thin crust--stays crispy enough to enjoy cold the next day.  Anyway-- welcome back to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have eatten here a number of times at this new location and delivery and the food has allways been good. This time the service for delivery has been horrific. It has been 2 hours since I originally called and we are still not eating. When I called after the first hour and was told they had the order for pick up in error. This was after I know we discussed a gate code for delivery.  After being told they would only discount 20% for there error, I am still waiting for food 56 minutes after they realized their. You would think my order would have gone to the front of the line, but apparently not. May be my last time here."}
{"text":"Very slow service and on top of that the employees are very rude.  The food is not good enough to deal with the slow service and rude employees, I would suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"This pizza is AMAZING!!  We had a thin crust Canadian bacon and pineapple with black olives and an all meat stuffed pizza.  Both were delicious!!  The service was excellent as well!!  Doesn't get much better than this!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love having a Rosati's so close by. The staff is always friendly and the food is excellent. I had a party here a few weeks ago and completely filled their second room and they made sure all of our guests were happy. My favorite go to for lunch!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the regular, large, pepperoni pizza.

I live near their Mineral Point location and since I can't seem to find a decent Italian spot, much less a pizza, in Madison..... I tried Rosati's.

This is my 2nd time ordering a pizza from them.  The first time they burnt it so when we ate it all we tasted was a char taste. Well, this one wasn't burnt, but instead of tasting the burnt taste, I tasted the sauce. Which tasted like Spaghettio sauce. Not a whole lot of cheese on there. The crust was thinner than I expected as I didn't order a \"thin crust\", just regular... *shrug* 

My husband and I both had a \"WTF\" moment and said that it tasted like a Tombstone. Then I said, \"Not even a Tombstone! Maybe a Jack's frozen pizza!\" Literally had me wishing I didn't waste $16 on this.

The 2nd star comes from the Italian Beef they have there. They are really good, and huge portion for the price. Wishing I would have ordered that instead of the pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered two sandwiches, a meatball sub and chicken parmigiana sandwich from this place. They were so bad after a few bites they were thrown away. We will not be going back to this place.
Our order was early Friday evening. 
The Meatball sub.. meatballs were burnt on one side but somehow still really mushy. They were very under seasoned which was the same with the sauce they were covered in.  Just horrible balls of mush.
The chicken parmigiana sandwich was very dry and they roll was half soggy and half microwaved hard.
We were big fans of Rosati's until this."}
{"text":"Worst service ever from the manager!!!  She was rude, very condescending and flat our a complete ignorant human being.  They deliver cold food not cooked correctly, and orders have been wrong on several occasions.  The question would be for me than why would I order more than one time just in case it was a bad day, because we all have them...  NOPE on three different occasions we had these problems.  You could not pay me to spend money or eat at this place ever again."}
{"text":"This place used to have great pizza 5-6 years ago, but has gone horribly down hill. One pizza sticks out in memory. It smelled like fish. I called and asked why they put anchovies on our pizza we didn't order it that way. They said they did not put fish on pizzas there. Scared the heck out of me. I guess it was something else on the pizza that was rancid. We're done with them."}
{"text":"We are from the Midwest and eat at Rosati's there.  We were glad to see that we could order in and enjoy the same here.  Quick and friendly service and the same high quality food.  We ordered thin crust, two 14\", one sausage and pepperoni and one Hawaiian Luau.  Both great. Be sure to order salads, they are excellent!  I hope the Southwest likes it as much as the Midwest!"}
{"text":"Uldate on update: changing the star to a 4. The owner of this venue contacted me. They thanked me for my feedback and explained how they are going to use it to improve in the future. How cool?! 

Even more cool - we ordered our usual again a couple weeks ago. The delivery arrived with a zeroed out bill. They not only honored the credit they initially offered, they added to it and I didn't even mention it. Bravo for turning this experience into a positive!!! 


Update: changing the star from 1 to 3. Manger Bill called me this morning. He apologized for the incident and took ownership (regardless that the cashier may have been inexperienced). Bill wanted to credit back the entire order, but asked if we would accept a store credit because it was already processed. We agreed. After he apologized again he said something critical, \"I hope that you remain our customer.\" 

Look I am a business owner and understand things happen. I still feel like this all could have been diffused but that's ok. Bill made the call (never easy) and I believe he is sincere. Thank you for the acknowledgment. 

This is the first negative review I have ever written. I'm starting with this point to establish just how bad my experience was. And the tragic part is that it could have been avoided multiple times before it got to a point where I was inspired to share this experience. 

We have been Rosatti's customers for years. They're not always perfect. But it's ok. The food is great and running any business is hard. Last night we called in our order. Because of the fights delivery was quoted an hour to an hour and a half. No problem, we decided to pick up. Cheese pizza, spinach salad and bread sticks. Nothing complicated. 

When I arrived I was greeted. The cashier brought out the pizza and a brown bag paper that looked like it held a standard to-go container. It was stapled shut. I asked three times, \"is that everything?\" Three times I was told yes. To the point I where I was made to feel like there was something wrong with me. So I figured the salad and breadsticks were packaged in the bag and off I went. 

When I got home and opened it bag there were only breadsticks. No salad. I was annoyed. If I had forgotten the salad or rushed off no big deal. I would have gotten in the car and went back. But I asked the cashier 3 times, \"is that everything?\" I called. Yep, the salad was there. All packed up and ready when I was there. \"Oh you can just come back and get it.\" Here is how the rest of the conversation went. 

Me: I asked three times if that was all. You said yes. You need to send it with a delivery guy. 

Rosattis: We're all backed up because of the fight. We can credit you back on your credit card. 
(Nice attempt to create a solution but didn't solve the problem). 

Me: When can you deliver it? 

Rosattis: (Puts me on hold. Comes back.) We're backed up so when it slows down. About 3 hours. 
(Clearly a response to get me either to come pick up the salad, or accept the credit and forget it.) 

Me: (Now I'm pissed). What's your manager's name? 

Rosattis: (Puts me on hold. Comes back.) He's not available. 

Me: What is his name? 

Rosattis: Bill. (Doesn't give last name even tho I asked). 

I hung up and went back to get the salad. I didn't demand the credit and never got it. But guess what I did when I got home? I called Rosattis from our land line. 

Me: Hi do you guys deliver? 

Rosattis: Yes within a 5 mile radius. And we're about 1 to 1.5 hours out on delivery right now.  

Remember the solution they offered - 3 hours to send it with a delivery guy. But if I ordered it again it would only be 1 to 1.5 hours...?

Ok so they made a mistake. I get it. Running a business is hard and especially on high volume nights like last night. Here are the things they could have done differently. 

Don't BS the customer and offer a sensible delivery time. (We would have accepted this solution actually). Or, stretch your resources a bit to make things right. It was your mistake after all. 

Don't be unavailable when you're the manager. The reason stores like this have a manager is to exercise judgement to resolve issues like this. If the manager is truly unavailable, offer to have them call back the customer. Even if it's the next day. 

I will say this, the young man who was working at the front when I went back at least apologized for the mistake."}
{"text":"MEH. 
I really, really wanted to like this place. It is so close to our house (walking distance) but this place was MEH at best.

Service: MEH
Atmosphere: MEH-
Food: MEH+

Timeliness of Order: MEH- -

I would not try this place again. The seating area is weird (too open and way too loud), food took forever and once it came it was just okay, and the overall experience was just not fun. It was not bad but it was so underwhelming I would not waste my time there. Totally worth the drive to Mellow Mushroom for better service, food, and atmosphere."}

Our waitress was so on top of everything, she was so sweet to my kids and just an overall wonderful person. If management reads this we were there around 1145-1230 she deserves employee of the year! The food was delicious, we got cheese sticks, spaghetti and baked lasagna. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Fist let me say I'm a pizza snob from back east but I had high hopes for the new owner of Rosati's as he's from Chicago.  We got a flyer on our door with a menu and a special offer of 3 free side orders if we ordered one of their specialty pizzas as he guarenteed we'd become second time customers.  Not going to happen.  As soon as I smelled the pizza I just though of Pizza Hut and it tasted just the same.  Rosati's gets an A for effort but I will be sticking to Mamma Mias for a cheap pizza plus joint that's close to home."}
{"text":"I grew up having Rosati's for Friday night pizza in my family. Always great food and reasonable prices. I think it is superior to the similar pizza places in the area. This location has new owners and they were very friendly and helpful when I picked up my order. Definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Prices...schmices.  This is still the place for me to go for pizza.

I'm raising them back up a star.  Ate here in Oct when the brother in-law was in town and their deep dish is still the bomb.  Loved the brother in-laws leftover thin crust too."}
{"text":"Oederd pizza on Father's Day was told 35 min I arrived 35 later and waited 35 more because the obliviously messed my pizza up . No explanation no sorry ! Won't be back pulse that place is a crackerjack box time to get some new equipment guys !!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Can't handle web orders without hassling the customer. Order was placed and paid for online and when presented with order info owner insisted on presenting the same credit card with an ID. What a hassle as business partner placed the order and required me to void online transaction and present a separate cc with an ID. Totally ridiculous. This is after previous employee blew off a $75 order due to online problems a few months ago. Doesn't listen to criticism. This guy should not get any business and definitely not mine. Gilbert location is far better--they know what they are doing. Stay away from Mesa location on Power!!!"}
{"text":"Disaster for customer service. I was quoted 15 minutes and waited 40. People working there seemed clueless. Salad was terrible. Pizza very expensive. The one in Chandler is better.  Stay away from this location!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish. Received the wrong pizza. Called. Thirty minutes later the correct pizza arrived. The driver actually asked for the other pizza back. As if they could resell it.  And, after all this, our pizza was cold. Late, with a hassle, and cold. Not only did they not offer to take something off the price, but they took back the other pizza. Someone needs to teach them customer service. 

Update (1 month later): You would think after such a negative review the owner would reach out and apologize. No such luck. The poor customer service apparently goes all the way to the top. It is a culture of bad service that is accepted. Stay away."}
{"text":"I've tried several pizza places in/near Vegas, but this one has been my favorite so far. It might be regional taste, but I like the cheese to the edge, square cut pizza. We ordered a large thin crust pizza, half classic combo and half pepperoni, bacon and garlic. The pizza was delicious, great cheese flavor and excellent marinara sauce. I would also recommend the appetizer \"nuggets.\"  I pictured a garlic knot type app but it was little squares of pizza dough lightly fried, served with marinara and ranch.  Crunchy outside and tender inside.  So good. It was a great meal and we had a very friendly waitress who was attentive."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. They have the best Italian beef sandwich dipped in au jus sauce in a way it reminds me of Chicago. I order delivery and it arrives hot and delicious. When I think of Rosatis Pizza I think of the best Italian beef in Las Vegas! You must go and try it for yourself believe me Rosatis is worth a try."}
{"text":"We normally go Barro's which we love, but then heard about Rosati's from a friend so we thought we'd try it out. First off, I should say the service was horrific. There were two servers who were \"working\". One spent much of her time talking to the guests from behind the bar and the other was sitting at the bar. It is clear there was no supervision or management in the place. 
For dinner, we ordered a Caesar salad and a pizza with Meatball and spinach. The Caesar salad came with wet lettuce and frozen, yes frozen cheese. This \"fresh\" salad was served with two kid forks. I have no idea why they even have kid sized forks but that's a whole other story. When our pizza came it was clear that there was some effort put into the making of it. It was hot and looked great. Unfortunately, it was not. The sauce tasted canned, the crust tasted old and it was no better than a frozen pizza from the grocery store.

Bottom line- We'll never be back. If I wanted a pizza that tasted the way this one did, I should have had a Digiorno."}
{"text":"Kids keep begging me to go back!  They loved the food and I loved the friendly staff and casual environment - well, and the food too.  You should check it out."}
{"text":"We've tried this place 3 times now (went through a new ownership) and all were unsuccessful. The employees are rude. You are not greeted when you walk but treated as an inconvenience. I can't imagine the owner knows he has people working for him like this. Every Rosatis we have been to has amazing quality pizza. Every time we have ordered pizza from here, the dough is old. You try to pull a piece off and it just falls apart. Not to mention I am told it will be 45-50 mins before the pizza is ready yet I've never seen another person in the place. Save yourself the headache and take the drive to the location at 59th Ave and Union Hills."}
{"text":"YUMMY!! this is the 2nd time that i have ordered from Rosatis and IM STILL IMPRESSED!! so so delish! Im really picky when it comes to pizza. Usually the sauce is what gets me all grossed out, but not here, i asked them for light sauce and i got just that! =) OMG! totally amazed. Pizza was on point and the wings are BOMB! 

will be coming back def! thanks"}
{"text":"I tried Rosati's for the first time recently after hearing great things about it for a long time.  I got the Hawaiian pizza with the crispy thin crust and some chicken strips.  The Hawaiian pizza comes with Canadian bacon, pineapple, BBQ sauce, and mozzarella cheese.  The BBQ sauce gave it a nice flavor.  The pizza was really enjoyable.  And the chicken strips were tasty, too. 

Just writing this makes me want to order from Rosati's again and try some of the other items on their menu.  Next time I do, I will update my review here."}
{"text":"A bit too pricey for the quality. Thus our plans are to frequent this location only a few times a year."}
{"text":"The owner is terrible. The worst experience. I ordered my food through post-mates and the owner kept saying my order was never received. The owner was very rude and unprofessional... Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Pricey and not worth it. 12 wings and a 12\" combo pizza set me back 35 bucks with tip. I'd totally be ok with the price if it was quality or unique. The pizza lacked toppings and the cheese used was government cheese. The wings were soggy and disguisting. The delivery guy forgot to bring Parmesan cheese and red pepper. Avoid this place at all costs.  Not worth it and not good.

In my mind pizza needs to hold any 2 of the following 3 qualities:
1.Taste good
2. Unique
3. Cheap 

It was none of the 3, that's why I'm giving it 1 star. Sadly fast food pizzas ( pizza hut, dominos, and even hot n ready lil caesars) are better than this crap.

Ciao."}
{"text":"I called for a take out order at 8:30 on Monday. Their hours of operation state that they are open until 9:00. I was told the kitchen had closed early. You will not build business by having unreliable hours of operation."}
{"text":"My husband and I are all about great pizza hunting here in Vegas and we were very impressed with this place!!! The deep dish was excellent and the service spectacular! Will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"A friend surprised me with delivery. They were fast, polite and the food was really good. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"New owners? We ordered from this place about once a month. We reallllllly liked the italian beef sandwich (The Chief) and their thin crust pizza was great, but this time around....not so much.
One of the biggest draws was that they double their coupons on Fridays-NO LONGER ACCEPTED. Albeit, they've lowered their prices but also lowered the quality of food. Being from Chi-town, I cannot believe they sold out by selling their name and reputation to people who lack customer service (honoring coupons) and cut corners in food preparation.
So long, Rosatis! It was great while it lasted I'll be across the street at Barros!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Go for the monster!!! Delivery was fast too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered small meatlovers Chicago style pizza to be delivered to a resort. It was incredible, best pizza ever and very large for a small. Delivery was quick."}
{"text":"First of all, let me just say their food is fantastic. I love their pizza. I love their salads. I love the cheesy garlic bread and their chicken parm.

What I don't love is the service. It never fails that we order for either delivery or pick up and something gets screwed up. 

We ordered salads and cheesy garlic bread for delivery one time and the salads came, but no bread. We called, they promised to credit our next order. Never got a credit.

We ordered pizza (multiples) one time and delivery was going to be TWO hours. I know they're busy, but come on. So I chose to pick it up instead. They told me 45 minutes. I got there and it wasn't even cooked yet. I waited there for 30 minutes before it was ready. I had a ton of hungry guys at my house waiting on this pizza!!

Last night was the last straw - we ordered an antipasto salad and chicken parm. We picked it up and get it home and we're missing a whole bag... no dressing for the antipasto salad and no dinner salad or dressing to go with the chicken parm. We called and they said they would deliver it but couldn't tell us how long. At this point, I had enough. We said to just forget it. Luckily we're moving this weekend and won't have to order from here anymore."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst Rosati's in the valley! We used to order from them all the time like several times a week. You'd think they'd treat their regulars well but no. My boyfriend and I always get half-and-half and it just seems like no matter what they could not get it right. When you walk in the girl with the pink dreads is always rude asf with a sourpuss face and they are slow to greet you. At least 3 Times they forgot the additional toppings such as ranch and cheese which are essential for me to enjoy the pizza. Finally, to top it off the most recent time my total for delivery came to $25 (over the phone I informed them I'd be paying cash) I had two $20s, the driver shows up after and hour and 15 minutes with NO change and had a fit that I wouldn't give him the $40/tip him the $15 and then tried to take the pizza back. 100% will not be buying from here again."}
{"text":"Best Rosati's Pizza out there - used to eat Rosati's Pizza as a child in Tempe in the 90's and haven't found one as great, except for tonight!  Everyone loved it and also ordered a gluten free pizza and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I like their deep dish pizza here.  Last night we tried the ravioli and the lasagna.  Well, we didn't quite get to try the lasagna because we got baked ziti instead?  Not sure what happened on that one but I think I'll stick to pizza in the future."}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout from here last weekend.  We had the chicken parm, spaghetti and meatballs, Italian Beef Sandwich, and something else (sorry don't remember).  Everything was ready on time when I went to pick it up and tasted great.  Italian Beef could have used an extra cup of juice so remember to ask for that if you order it.  Previously we've only ever had their pizza which is great too."}
{"text":"Check out there web site for some pretty good deals - especially the wings. Only place I've found in this area that makes mild wings that won't melt your face off and still have taste!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food outstanding service by all staff I used to order from here and they took my advice and open up a sports bar I could not be more impressed everything high-class all around I highly suggest coming here because I will be here a lot during football season"}
{"text":"I honestly think my boyfriend and I are single-handedly keeping this place open LOL! We order pizza 1-2 times a week, it's so good! I'm originally from Chicago and have had a hard time finding a good pizza place, but I really like this one. Rosati's tends to be hit or miss, but I think this one's a hit. We've never had a problem with the staff or our food, which is why we keep coming back! I can't say I've ever tried anything other than their pizza, so I can't speak to the quality of it. But overall, love it!!

Oh, and for those of you who think I'm probably the owner or a friend of the owner, I'm really not. I grew up in Oak Park, IL and I'm a self- proclaimed pizza snob. I've tried other Rosati's locations in the area and I can honestly say this one's tasty :)"}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from Rosati's. There customer service and attention to detail is outstanding. The CDD pizza was off the charts and every bit as good as anything you can get in Chicago. Not may places can duplicate a CDD pizza much less exceed expectations.  I'm looking forward to ordering it again......and in the very near future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered delivery last night (which is normally very good) and what we got was the worst food we've ever gotten. My boyfriend ordered the Italian sandwich and the bread was so soggy it instantly fell apart as soon as he picked up the sandwich to eat it. And then what wasn't soggy and falling apart was hard as a rock and impossible to chew. I ordered a Cesar salad and I got what looked like a good salad until I started eating it and found the lettuce to be wilted and soggy and the aluminum delivery bowl that it was in was full of nasty water in the bottom. We also ordered appetizers mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini and asked for marinara sauce and we didn't get any at all instead we got one thing of ranch that was warm not cold. I tried calling in to the restaurant to speak to a manager and got no answer, so I left a message. I called again this morning and got no answer and still have not received a call back from the manager either. This is not only the worst food we've ever gotten but some of the worst service as well. Regardless of whether the customer is dining in or having their food delivered, I think the restaurant should take full responsibility of the bad food we were served because if we were there and sent out food back they would've served us something else or they would've done something to make it right for us. I will never eat here or order from here ever again. Absolutely horrible place of business."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE.

first of all, they are not listed with all the other Rosati's in the valley, they have their own website for some reason.
While other Rosati's have the same pricings on the menu, this one does not so BE AWARE. I ordered a family sized Mostaccioli and wings and when i got the total, it was a bit more than what i expected so i requested an itemized receipt. when i got it, the mostaccioli was almost $8 more than all the other locations. I understand that it's independently owned but it's a same franchise. So it's like saying the McDonald's on one location can charge $10 for a hamburger while all the other McDonald's sell it for $3.

When i called to express my frustrations, the guy on the phone rather made me feel stupid about not understanding why the prices are different than other Rosati's. 

let's just say BAD SERVICE!!!! and when i actually went on to their \"own\" website, they don't even have the prices listed on the menu.

the food wasn't bad but i won't order from this Rosati's ever again, i do not support such a bad business practice and poor customer service."}
{"text":"After the management changed, the pizza crust changed. It was terrible! It tasted like frozen cardboard! We used to love it. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"I had the antipasto salad and chicken parmesan. I absolutely loved the salad. The blend of green peppers, pepperoncinis, salami, green olives, black olives and various other types of meat was delicious. The chicken parmesan was ok-chicken was dry and the sauce could have tasted better. Overall service was good. There was one person working and he made sure that my table was well taken care of."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this a try after receiving a brochure on our door.  It was awful!  Where do I begin.......my husbands chicken wings were burnt, My house salad was literally a half a head of iceburg lettuce ripped up in huge chunks with a quartered tomato sitting on top.  Didn't get the garlic bread that came with my linguini and clams, so can't review.  The cheesecake was bland and tasted like scrambled eggs and came with a little cup of raspberry syrup.  I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture.  Called the manager after we ate and got the standard I'm sorry bologney. A waste of $60.00, don't know how business that serve this crap can stay in business."}
{"text":"Bread? Good! Cheese? Good! I'm usually not very picky when it comes to pizza, but Rosati's pizza was tastier than I expected. We ordered a thin crust 14 inch pizza with onions, pepperoni, and olives. It was rather yummy.

We also ordered some chicken wings, which were also pretty good.

We ordered over the phone and the delivery was fast.

But... Our 14\" pizza, 6 chicken wings (with one cup of sauce), and a modest tip for the driver cost $30. The pizza was good, but it wasn't THAT good. 

At first, the pizza seems affordable, but each additional topping on the 14\" cost $1.60. We really would have been better off buying a frozen pizza from Fresh & Easy. 

In short, I recommend the pizza, but perhaps it would be better by the slice."}
{"text":"Great food and great people. Every single delivery driver has a great attitude.  I recommend trying them out. I have definitely added Rosatis to our once a week dinner menu."}
{"text":"The only thing that could possibly HAVE made this GREAT PIZZERIA ANY BETTER IS having Mary taking our order and the young man who delivered
(I am sorry dude I lost your name in my head due to the great over whelming aroma) so we could only give you 5 stars instead of 6, and thats Yelps fault.
This place has NEVER let us down.Keep up the good work!!!
6 STARS ON THE DAVIS SCALE."}
{"text":"2 words ... Never Again!!  
Just that simple! In my honest opinion you should not have to wait almost 2 hours then be offered to wait another 45 min for a new pizza because the one you ordered has been sitting there all this time never delivered  and is cold now. I cancelled the order! It was clear in my opinion they could care less that they lost my business! So be it! There are a lot of pizza places that deliver and are cheaper, double bonus blessing in disguise"}
{"text":"I ordered my Pizza and wings and I wanted my wings extra extra crispy.  Well I picked up my order on my way home and when I arrived home my wings were not extra  crispy and there was No ranch.  I called to let the manager know this and I mentioned there was no ranch and he said they have a new cook and he forgot to put it in there and the he can take a dollar off my next order or I can come and pick it up.  I let him know that I didn't live in the area and we picked it up on the way home.  He said he can have someone deliver it but  he would have to charge me three dollars. You can imagine my surprise when I just spent $30 with them and they want to charge me three more.  I told him why should I have to pay for the cooks mistake and he should take the money Out of the cooks pay.  Needless to say  I will Never order from them again..my wings were under cooked and not cooked as I requested and the Pizza is salty.  If this is Chicago style them I'm good with not having it in my life anymore.  Please be cautious when ordering from this place because their mistakes will cost you."}
{"text":"10pm, Walked in. Nobody inside. Good indicator to turn around. Wish I would have done just that. Ordered a drink and was told the other(1 of 2) IPA's was garbage. So I had one choice! My gf ordered a vodka soda and it was her worst. That's hard to mess up. Bar tender came back and I asked if I could order a pizza. He told me the kitchen was closed. After 10pm this place is not prepared for visitors. The employees wanted us to leave."}
{"text":"Just about as perfect as a Chicago-style pizza can get. Their sauce was excellent, and their crust is superb! Sauce on top, just like it should be, piled with loads of toppings and cheese!

Service was ok - she kept my drink filled. They only had one server though, and they got busy quickly, so she was very frantic and all over the place.

Appetizer sampler was ok, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill! I ordered 2 pizzas and when I went to pick them up, one was burned. They said they could redo but after 15 minutes they said it was ready and the pizza was not even cooked through. I had ordered ravioli there too and the pasta was doughy and sauce was burned. You should avoid this place at all costs. Their answer to a complaint is \"we'll give you a free 2 liter bottle of coke.\" No manager or any idea of what customer service is!"}
{"text":"Reopened last year, 2014 sometime.

I eat here often and  I recommend that you call ahead and order for pick up because if it is a busy Friday or Saturday night you could be waiting 45 minutes if you just go in and order. I sometimes get delivery and sometimes it is a little later than the time that is stated but generally on time. I have always been happy with the customer service.

I love the pizza and the deep dish especially. The pizza is a little more expensive than some places but that is because they actually put toppings on the pizza. They are not trying to fill you up with just flour. They put 1 pound, 16 oz, of cheese on the 18\" pizza. I love the Godfather pizza: sausage, onions, spicy giardiniera, and garlic. Yum!!

The wings are okay, just average, but I still get them. I really like the hamburger and fries. Huge patty. I never had anything from the menu that I would consider bad.

All in all a good place to get some pizza and anything else that is on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for the first time. The tomato taste was so overbearing that you could not taste anything else. Better off going to Little Ceasars."}
{"text":"Let me explain my experience at this restaurant. My mother and I came in for a hotdog and fries on a week night. It was a Monday night just to add as anyone can imagine it was very slow. There were only two of us. Had us waiting for 25 minutes for a simple hotdog with fries. We drive off only to realize the bun to the hotdog was as hard as a rock. Decided to go back for a refund at this point given the wait time and the poor choice of bun. The pregnant hillbilly looking bucktooth broad didn't even apologize because it was our fault for \"rushing\" her. In her exact words, \"the bun wouldn't have been hard had you guys not been rushing us.\" First, we weren't rushing, we simply asked how much longer it would take after 15 minutes. She gave us our refund of course. Seeing as she wasn't at least courteous about the poor food, she didn't say anything at all. My mother walked out and I stayed in to ask for a manger. Without her realizing I stayed inside, she complained out loud to the cook that the bun wasn't hard, half of the dog was eaten, and she didn't care about it. I stood behind the counter with a smirk and said, \"is your manger in?\" Her voice began to shake, very nervous, dropped the pen after I asked her to give me the number to the manager, didn't make any logic. Then she said, \"we're not allowed to give the managers number.\" \"Who do I file a complaint to?\" I said. She replied, \"you'll have to come in when he's here.\" Dumb beaver didn't even know what to say as she wasn't making any sense. I decided not to waste anymore time so then I just said, \"next time, if you want to provide customer service in which you're lacking, ensure the customer has left the building before you bad mouth clients.\" She nodded her head as a yes. I swear, I lost brain cells talking to her. On a personal note, I can't see anyone impregnating that thing. She wore a black tank top with the shortest pink booty shorts. Not how you run an establishment. Hopefully she reads this being they promote Yelp and 10% discounts. Hey, save yourself 10% by snapshotting this and showing them. LOL!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive, and honestly not the best pizza anyway. 1 small plain cheese pizza for $18? Please."}
{"text":"While some of their food is good, the service leaves little to be desired.  Unless you are simply going in to grab a slice(which is pre-made), plan on waiting awhile.  The first time I went, I ordered a salad, and it took 20+ minutes for them to get the salad to me.  Please know...it was a simple salad.  Needless to say, I had about 10-15 minutes to scarf it down before I had to head back to work.  Today, I called my order in(breaded mushrooms), and was told 10 minutes.  I got there in exactly 10 minutes, and surprise, they were not ready.  I had to wait another 10 minutes before they were ready.  Really??  Drop in the oil, fry them up, and that's it.  Even I know it doesn't take 20 minutes for them to cook.  Meanwhile, there was another customer waiting, who was there when I arrived.  They messed his order up so badly, they had to refund his money, and told him they would have to deliver it to him.  Ridiculous!

On another note, while waiting, I had clear view of one of the cooks.  He was handling food without any gloves on.  He would touch the food, then touch the counter or some other item, then wipe his hands on his pants, and then touch the food again.  Can we say health violation?!!  This is completely unacceptable in my book.  There are enough germs floating around in this world...I shouldn't have to fight food poisoning, too.

I definitely will NOT be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I love the pizza. But when I called to place a delivery the girl on the phone told me I couldn't. They were closing in 10 minutes. It's 8:22 and they close at 9. Who the hell runs this store. Because if the owner knew this, this staff should get replaced. I've been to many all around town and never get treated like this. Pizza great... service sucks. I'll make sure I drive to another location out of my way to eat this stuff again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rosatis in different states for years and they've always been pretty consistent. This location has always given me a great product. I brought up the bad yelp reviews on my visit and they referred to the old owners. My double dough classic combo is still on point. 
Keep doing it Olive location."}
{"text":"I do love Rosati's pizza, but I had ordered several Restaurant.com certificates and now they tell me that they're not accepting those anymore?! That is a bad way to do business and lose customers. These were purchased on 9/28/14. I'm going to try to get my money back with Restaurants.com, but I'm not hopeful on that one!"}
{"text":"I used to really like Rosati's. But we have stopped going to this location. The last few times we decided to give them another shot...we ordered take out and then tried dining in a different time. Each time was increasingly disappointing.. The food was greasy and mediocre at best. The servers acted clueless and extremely slow...There was only 2 other tables dining in & after over 10 minutes with empty cups my boyfriend had to get up to find somebody to get drink refills... Very disappointing and have gone down hill immensely. The last time we ordered take out....the order of wings had two chicken feet in it! Gross."}
{"text":"Horrible not because of the food but because of the lack of integrity in the employees and not taking ownership for a system that advertised 20% by ordering online but then did not honor the discount.   Neither of the employees could explain how to get the 20% of off either. I then showed him on the Web where I ordered it from my phone and there was no coupon button as he suggested.  Very disappointed as I really wanted to like this place but I will take integrity over quality anytime."}
{"text":"I went to Rosati's for lunch today with four co-workers, one of whom is a Windy City native. And while I do like the pizza here, it's not the best Chicago-style pizza I've had. But I guess it will have to do until we get a Giordano's. (Hey, we're finally getting a White Castle, so anything's possible!)

Of the three styles of Chicago pizza (stuffed, deep dish, and super thin), I prefer the stuffed. Rosati's is a decidedly thin-style joint, although they do have deep dish on the menu. The lunch special is a pizza and salad buffet for $8.50, and that's what most of us usually get. Unfortunately, for that price, you don't get much -- and this is an all-you-can-eat endeavor.

There's usually only two or three types of pizza (today it was cheese, pepperoni, and pepperoni and sausage), and you have to wait for them to bring it out to sit under the heat lamps. When it's gone, it's gone, and you just have to wait for them to bring out more. So while you wait, you can fill up on salad, which is basically big chunks of iceberg lettuce with a few topping options (pickled beets, cucumber chunks, peppers, cheese, and tomatoes). At least the Greek dressing is good. And there are unlimited refills on drinks, which you serve yourself.

Speaking of service, even though this is a \"buffet,\" the service was pretty poor. One of my co-workers ordered a calzone off the menu, and it took forever to get it. We also had to wait a long time for our check, and I don't think our waitress cracked a smile once.

As I said, I do like the pizza at Rosati's, so I'm not sure why I keep ordering the buffet. This location is close to the office, so it's become a staple of our lunchtime crew and I'm pretty sure I'll be back. Maybe next time I'll follow my rogue co-worker's lead and order something off the menu. (And it may even be cheaper to order a personal-size pizza ... with MY choice of toppings!)"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has already changed ownership.
        The pizza was decent-good tasting with a fair amount of toppings,but pretty expensive for the size and quality.My wife and I decided to use a Groupon,and eat the pizza there.The dining style is basically you order at the counter,and they bring the pizza to you.Very informal.The behind the counter girl had to serve us,also.We were given 10 ounce glasses with the ice tea and water we asked for,and the dining area was quite warm,which was dissapointing since it was over a hundred degrees outside that day.
     The canoli and cheesecake were both quite good,although the portions were small.
           Im afraid my wife and I are spoiled by the competion in this area(Grimaldi's and BJ's) as far as pizzerias go.Im glad we had the half priced Groupon,or we would have been even more dissapointed."}
{"text":"These guys are like family, always a great conversation coming in to dine. Delivery is always delicious and on time. Doesn't get better in the valley. You have to check out their thin crust square-cut style and their Mostaccioli Alforno."}
{"text":"Ok guys, this is  the THIRD time you charged us for a beverage and NOT delivered it.
TRUST=0; Creibility = 2; Qualtiy = 4; Customer service = Schizo3"}
{"text":"The pan style pizza was perfect with a non dry cluster! Service was good with a typical family style setting with checkered table clothes. The gyro pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"Poor. The time before this last time we order three entries and one appetizer and the bill was nearly $80 bucks! My wife called and complained and was told their prices increased. For that price I can go to a nice Italian restaurant and have a comfortable and relaxing time. 

This last time we ordered two large pizzas (with extra cheese) and the bill was nearly $60 but I knew that going into it. We've always loved their food. This time though they loaded (sprinkled on top) our pizzas with WAYYYY TO MUCH oregano and other spices so much that even our dogs wouldn't eat it.

My wife again complained and didn't get anywhere with the person who answered the phone so she asked to speak with the manager...The manager was forward and very rude to my wife saying this is the way that have always made it and that there would not be any adjustment. My wife was floored.

NO MORE ROSATI'S FOR US!!!

And to confirm what another poster said....we also have had lots of problems with late deliveries only to find out the food was incorrect. In one instance we had someone else's order!

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Well, that was an unpleasant dinner. We ordered a cheese deep dish and sadly wished we had opted for a bowl of cereal from our pantry instead. The sauce was excessively salty, the cheese all but non existent and crust was the taste and texture of cardboard. I'm not typically critical of food...its just food after all...but was really plain old bad."}
{"text":"I read what Terrence wrote and it was 100% accurate. Used their delivery before and had THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM! What the hell is wrong with this location that the corporate office doesn't fire this staff and bring back the pizza delivery that this chain is know for. Fire the jerks and save your company!"}
{"text":"They have really improved their atmosphere, pizza quality and wings. Great deal on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings for the family! Ordered a large with BBQ wings and it was delicious. Grew up on eating Rosati's but when I moved to Mesa there wasn't a location close by until I found this location close to home. It was my boyfriends first time ordering the day after we went to a friend's house and had Rosati's for a quick dinner and he loved it! Loved so much we ordered tonight for dinner! Great customer service and the delivery guy was amazingly nice!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Chandler and have been eating at Rosati's for several years now.  I recently moved to Phoenix and decided to give this place a try.  It's night and day from the one in Chandler.  The place is a joke.  The pizza is expensive as it is, but it's the customer service that is a joke.  I placed an order and went in to pick it up.   I stood at the front counter for over 10 minutes before someone helped me.  It looks like the lady went to walgreens to get her cigrettes and asked what can I do for you.  I told her I placed an order and here to pick it up.  I gave her my last name and she looked it up and said I didnt place an order cause she couldnt find my last name.  I told her I spoke with a man and placed it about 30 minutes ago.  The lady then said I must of placed it at the wrong location.  She was very adamant that I placed it at the wrong store and I was 100% sure I placed at the right location.  Minutes later the delivery driver walked in and said, this must be your pizza, I thought it was for delivery.  It would make sense the lady had no clue what was going on, cause she probably was on break the entire time.  Anyways, I left and paid.  While I got home the pizza was terrible.  I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  They put pepperoni and onions.  Freaking idiots.  Regardless the pizza was terrible and service was crap.  

I now go to Spinato's or Isa's.  Much better customer service and pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was freshly made after we ordered it so that was a plus. Really expensive though. $17 for a pizza that feeds 3 people. Their thin crust is really delicious but it's topped with a layer of these that is twice as thick. Gross. And very oily. I probably won't ever order from here again unless I do pizza-by-the-slice which they offer rarely throughout the day. The last 2 times I tried, they did not have it available."}
{"text":"The Cheyenne location my closest go to so I haven't tried the other locations. I was wanting something better than just pizza and chicken. Is on the expensive side but we'll worth it! I've had the calzones and the deep dish. It fills the gut of my endless eating boyfriend who can eat a whole pizza by himself lol. It was certainly worth it every penny and can't wait to try more on the menu. S/o to Devon who helped me with my order and the driver was right in time. I'm sorry I forgot her name I was too happy to see her lol"}
{"text":"Was craving pasta so I ordered from them and put in an order for cheese ravioli and fettuccine Alfredo. They called about 5 minutes after I ordered to tell me they were out of cheese ravioli so I went with the meat one instead. Both entrees come with a breadstick and side salad. The side salad came with one slice of cucumber and 1 mini tomato. 

The meat ravioli was actually very good. However, the Alfredo was really grainy and tasted like unmelted cheese. If I didn't get it delivered I would have sent it back for sure. Upon finishing it I currently feel like a brick of crap is sitting in my stomach and I wish I finished the meal with a bite of ravioli rather than the Alfredo. Probably won't order again."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for pick up afterwork. I called about 30 minutes before I arrived and only waited for about 5 minutes for the S.O.B double crust 12\". The place was pretty quite for a Tuesday afternoon when I went, seemed like only the employees were  there.  Not sure if I would go again, a little too pricy for pizza. Just wanted to try the pizza place."}
{"text":"BEWARE this Rosati's has changed ownership and you should avoid it.

We placed a phone order for delivery at 6:50 and were told it would be 45 minutes. One hour and 15 minutes later we called back and they had lost the address. It wasn't clear if they had made the pizzas and they were sitting around or if they just lost the whole order. In any case, they said they'd send them right out.

We live 7 minutes away. 35 minutes later we called again and got more confusing answers about who was the manager and where our order was. We asked for a refund and told them we still wanted our pizza. Their response was that we would have to pay if we wanted the pizza, so we told them to just issue a refund and keep the pizzas. They said OK.

We then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place. During the call, the doorbell rang with Rosati's delivery person. Based on what we were told on the phone, we turned him away. He explained that they were under new management and had been messing things up all over the place. He left with the pizzas.

What a fiasco. Maybe if they stay in business long enough to figure out how to handle a simple pizza order it will be good again. We'll never know, as we're never going to be their customers again."}
{"text":"Got 5 stars for great flavored pizza! I'm a huge pizza lover and I must say this was the best we've had since living in AZ for 5 yrs. Ordered 1 deep dish and 1 stuffed crust, both 10\". It was delivered and wasn't ooey gooey melty, but maybe that's expected after delivery. If you put it in a pan for a bit to warm the middle and crisp it up it's perfect. 

Yelp coupon may not work for delivery orders, just a heads up (but who cares about free breadsticks when you can fill up on their amazing pizza?!). My hubby talked to the store owner about that and he was super nice. Actually found out that they ship their ingredients from Chicago... so legit. It really makes a difference you can taste.

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered an extra large pizza and a family-size salad for my family tonight that was delivered. I was a little shocked at the price- $50.00, but even more shocked when I opened the box to see flat, burnt, over-cooked pizza and a salad that was overwhelmed with browning, clearly expired, soggy lettuce. 

If it were my restaurant, I would have never allowed food that looked like that to be delivered, it would have gone straight in the trash before I'd allow it to be a reflection of my business, especially on a large ticket. 

Rosati's got $50.00 of my hard earned money and my family got a very disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery- I'm staying nearby for work.  julie who took my order was delightful!  She made some suggestions and was right on!  The delivery was here quicker then stated...  He was super friendly (didn't catch his name) and my food was perfect!  The caprese salad was delicious and arrived in perfect condition as did my pizza.  I ordered a small double dough pepperoni classic.  It was HUGE and delicious!  I have plenty of left overs... Or I may have ordered again tomorrow!  Don't always listen to what the negative comments say...  I'd go back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"By far best chicago style pizza in the southwest of town. Pizza is good cold or hot, sauce is amazing and staff is awesome!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is Dad's pick on his Scottsdale pizza quest, and we take Dad's opinion very seriously. I had a piece reheated and it was great! Crispy crust, crumbled sausage. I've tried pizza from a few places in Scottsdale so far, and this is definitely the best."}
{"text":"Rosati's is a pizza/ribs/sandwiches/pasta/chicken/salads/desserts delivery service and the only restaurant that I regularly order from. That's because the quality of their food is top notch and their service is excellent. 

My favorites are the ribs, chicken parmesan and pizza (in various crusts). I could order these things every day from Rosati's never get tired of them.

I'm from Chicago so I'm very familiar with \"Chicago-style\" food and Rosati's does a wonderful job of making authentic Chicago pizzas. I can't say that I've tried everything on the menu because I tend to stick to my favorites but I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised when you receive your order.

Of course, other important factors are the people taking and delivering the orders. Tonight Brandan took my phone order (for a full rack of Baby Back Ribs) and he is clearly one of the best phone guys in town. He is friendly and knowledgeable about their menu items. It took him less than 30 seconds to take my order, run my credit card and verify my delivery instructions.

The rest of the staff also contributes to a good dining experience, especially their delivery staff. I frequently get Rosati deliveries by a young woman named Chelsea. As always, she provided a prompt and correct delivery of my order. And I greatly appreciated the fact that she was happy, friendly and professional. 

Incidentally, I've never had an error in my order, nor have I ever needed to return any item for being improperly prepared. Rosati's is  batting 100% with me.

At their location on Hualapai (702-262-1900) Rosati's is delivery only. There is no dining area."}
{"text":"Sheryl is lazy, rude, and needs to be fired ASAP.  Loyal customers for two and a half years now gone.  Waiting on Rocco's now :) Woot woot!"}
{"text":"I would have given Rosati's a 4-Star rating if it wasn't for the disappointing visit and customer service I had there. Apparently, you can be charged MORE for ordering LESS. I found that out the other day on my first visit there, at the Hualapai location. On the menu, it listed the thin pizza with Pepperoni, Mushroom, Pepper and Onions at $15.45, so I ordered one without the Green Peppers and Onion. First of all the cashier did not say anything about the extra charge, but did not even give me a receipt, like she knew the amount is not the same. I noticed the amount is a little higher than I thought it would be; after I asked for one, and looked at it, I brought it to the cashier's attention, and all she could say is that the computer calculated it that way. I did not want to make a big deal about 50 cent, but thought it was a good point, and expected at least a valid explanation or a credit. But i guess, this is what they count on, the fact that most people would not want to argue over 50c, which was the case with me as well, but it was also the way they quickly brushed it off and blamed it on the register! If you think about it, it is only a few pennies for me, but imagine how much it would add up to when this happens all the time... Needless to say, I did not make a scene out of it, but congratulations Rosati's, you just made an extra 50c out of me, but lost a customer who would have came back over and over. The pizza is good, but when you get skimmed like that, it just leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. By the way, you can have a very similar thin pizza with the same taste and spices at Costco! It comes with a pack of 4, for just over $10..."}
{"text":"Yuck....Yuck...YUCK! THE WINGS WERE COLD AND SUPER FATTY! SUPER SUPER FATTY! Virtually no meat. The pizza we ordered was supposed to be a jalape√±o double dough with extra cheese.  There was no extra cheese. The dough was like store bought.  I would have hated to see what the pizza with no extra cheese looked like. Maybe crummy tomato sauce slipped on a piece of cardboard. My daughter liked her chicken and rice soup. She also ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. We had to keep asking for more sauce and just left the rest of the slimy noodles there. We spent over 60.00 today for just the 3 of us. It was the most unappealing unappetizing dinner we have ever had. We used to go there quite a bit and would make the drive to this specific rosatis for a reason. It was always such a treat. So delicious. What did you all change? Besides EVERYTHING.  We will MOST DEFINITELY not be back. Out side it advertised the football games could he seen there.  All the tvs were not working. Our waitress was nice and friendly. We left her an okay tip. Poor girls going to get stiffed if people don't understand it is not her fault the food is not edible."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!! Repeated my order a million times & spoke to 3 different people, they couldn't seem to understand \"sauce on the side\" for my wings. Ordered for pick up at 7pm, didnt get my food until after 9pm. Manager cussing at the staff while Im sitting here waiting & insulting the staff about everything they're doing wrong. End result? My food was wrong & cold. This place is ghetto & rude as hell! Closed at 10pm but locked their doors at 830pm bc they lost someones huge order & had to remake it??? This place sucks!!!"}
{"text":"NOT good. We ordered wings delivery to our hotel. It took well over an hour, cost $28+ for 24 wings that tasted terrible."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorites but the customer service and the overall kitchen has went down. At least I can still rely on you guys for fried zucchini. You guys are too pricey for being so rude and making pizza that is just as good as Peter piper. Your sauce is overpowering and it needs to be blended better feels very grity and Sandy."}
{"text":"The pizza was good. The delivery fast. The customer service was great.  This was my first time eating from there. I would eat from there again. The wings was great the first time but the 2nd time.. Not as good. I would, however ,still order from them again."}
{"text":"It's Sunday night no one felt light cooking or leaving the house. Sooooo
we decided to order PIZZA! Being rather new to here I have never tried a Pizza from the area. I had a few reccomendations but none of them delivered.
Rosatis did so I ordered a large double crust (as for me it's all in the crust), vegetarian with added veggies. 
The total was $32.00 , $35.00 with a tip. I thought it pretty high but so were my expectations.
It looked really good until I took my first bite. YUK! on the crust, it was like eating dried bread sticks. Perhaps overcooked or too much flower. 
The toppings were under cooked and watery with very little cheese.
No one ate the actual end crust, not even my dog, who loves pizza.
They got me once but not again!

I could have bought 3 large Costco pizzas for that price and been in heaven.
Live and learn."}
{"text":"My wife ordered from here and we loved it. The deep dish pizza is great, the wings are great, and the garlic bread is great too.

We've been here several times since and haven't been disappointed yet. Recently, I convinced my brother and his girlfriend to try it too, and they are now fans. If you're looking for pizza that's better than average, check out Rosati's."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! Remind me of back home.  The cheese is out of this world. And I can tell they take pride in their food since I found this place I haven't order pizza no where else"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location and eaten there a couple times as well. IMO you cannot beat the pizza here and everything else I've ever had has been awesome. My only complaint especially after the order I just made for delivery is that this place has no online ordering system at all, there's a website for Rosatis but ordering is not available for this location. and waiting on hold for 5 mins and than playing sharades over a bad phone signal reminded me to much of the 90s."}
{"text":"I've been eating pizza my whole life. I'm Italian from NY, and have spent time in Chicago. So I know what Chicago pizza is supposed to be.... Not this. Not at all. 

Anyone on here that thinks otherwise... Well, that's what opinions are for I suppose."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm so good! I ordered the meat parmigiana sandwich. It was fantastic. Service was also really good. I would recommend it!  I'll be back to try the chicken parmigiana sandwich."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Reviewers:

I am writing a review on Rosati's Pizza's meatballs - this is an item you can order as an appetizer or as a main course.  
They come two meatballs to an order which are about 2\" in diameter with marinara sauce for $4.00.
We usually get them \"to go\" and then make pasta at home and add our favorite sauce.
If you like sauce, then ask for extra.  Otherwise, you will come up short with the typical amount of sauce provided to you for pasta and/or for dipping bread in.
The meatballs in the past had always been tender and juicy.  But, the meatballs we got this weekend (two orders of them) were very tough and were not moist/juicy.  
I don't know if they changed vendors, who makes the meatballs - if they had a bad day or what . . . . but, they were a huge disappointment.   
Therefore, I am having to give our most recent experience a two-star rating since we have gotten better from this location, therefore, we know they are capable of doing better!"}
{"text":"I have been up since 6am running around and doing errands. By 9:45am I was starving. It seemed much later in the day already to me. So I Called Rosatis around  9:45am, and ordered  a deep dish pizza, a thin crust pepperoni and the dough knots.  The deep dish was for me, but I figured I go ahead and get a couple of things to have when the kids got home from school.  The guy who answered the phone, took my order and told me it would be ready in about 35 minutes.  I already knew  that because I order from here all the time.  The Deep dish takes about 35 minutes to cook... That's why I was calling ahead... So, he tells me 35 minutes and I hang up... I get there about 30 minutes later, the pizza isn't quite done, but I knew I was a few minutes early, so I sat in the waiting area for a few minutes.  It's approx 10:25am, When I get there, there's only one guy working in the back, he was preparing a pizza, so I said hello so he would know I was there... There was no one else there when I got there.  After I had been sitting there for a few minutes , another employee comes in and clocks in, then another.   They turn the lights on. I hadn't realized the main lights weren't even on when I arrived.  ANYWAY, I asked the girl if they were open, because it sorta dawned on me that it was early and I just put the pieces of the puzzle together.  She said that the website says they open at 10:30, but the restaurant opens  at 11am...

So the IMPORTANCE of my review is this;   I called in my order at 9:45am.  (They open at 11am) The guy didn't say we are not open, he took my order.  When I got there, no one blocked the door so I couldn't enter, I was allowed in the store. My order was HOT and ready, with a smile at 10:40, (20 minutes before they even open, and with a pizza that takes 35 Minutes to cook) AND  he guy offered me an apology  because I had to wait for the five
Minutes that I waited....   NOT TO MENTION, The pizza looks and smells incredible..... That is wonderful customer service... I'm also posting a photo of my order so you can drool over it while I eat it."}
{"text":"The best thing there is the guy from Milwaukee behind the bar!!! Best guy around really gives you an enjoyable experience. Best wings I've eaten in ages, just don't hate on the Brewers while your here;) hahaha"}
{"text":"Got carry out twice now.  Amazing food!  Service is great!  Very much mom and pop feel... Meaning they actually care about you and your happiness!  We live in San Tan valley and will still go out of our way to come to this location!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious and always satisfies the taste buds. I always recommend Rosati's to my friends and family. I ordered pick up for my fianc√© and I. The female cashier must of been having a bad day, she could use a fine tuning in customer service."}
{"text":"Pizzas ok, almost like back home, but the delivery driver is shady, and ripped my kids off for 6 bucks. I used to order from here 3-5 times a month, I'll never order at this store again."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the state. Being from Chicago, this is as good as it gets.  Everyone is always so friendly when you call in your order, or if they are delivering.  Truly a family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this Rossati's since they opened but have seen a decline in quality over time. Recently had a home delivery order of Fettuccine Alfredo which was not prepared with fettuccine but mostaccioli , not baked just the pasta with the sauce over it. I will be sticking with the pizza only going forward. I am originally from Chicago and was a Rossati's customer back then, so this was really a disappointment. Another issue was that as part of the phone order I was asked for the tip for driver on the phone. This was inappropriate in my opinion ."}
{"text":"Problems 

#1 It takes forever....around 30 min for one pizza but most Rosatis are slow

#2 They wouldn't take a 50% off coupon I had

#3 It cost almost $25 for 5 mozzarella sticks and a large pizza?

#4 They mozzarella sticks weren't hot or even warm. The cheese inside was hard

#5 The pizza tasted horrible

I have eaten pizza from a few different Rosatis in the valley but this place was horrible.

The only good thing was that the girl who was working the front was cute."}
{"text":"First time trying deep dish pizza, loved it! Also had the mozzarella sticks and wings both were very tasty as well!  Will definitely be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"Just came to this location a few days ago. I've never been here before but decided to try it out with my family since I bought a Groupon. So we didn't know it was a pick up and we had to wait like 30mins because we didn't place an order (it was our fault for not placing an order ahead of time). We ordered a massive pizza with a lot of meat and peppers and mushrooms and onion. My entire family loved it!! We also got 12 jumbo habanero mango wings and 12 jumbo parmesan ones. The habanero mango were delicious and tangy and sweet with a little spice and the parmesan ones had a delicious cheesy flavor to it. I highly recommend you buy pizza. They have pasta, pizza, wings, and more. Thank you Rosati's. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Rosati's has been our favorite pizza joint for years now.  The staff is always friendly.  The veggies are always fresh and the pizza never disappoints.  Every time I have pizza elsewhere I compare it to Rosati's and Rosati's always wins!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed by pizza and appetizers tonight. the folks next to us also commented on dry pizza. the chicken wings and calamari were just awful."}
{"text":"Solid Chicago style thin-crust pizza. Quality ingredients throughout the menu, but they often skimp on toppings/meat. Stick with the excellent thin-crust and skip the rest of the menu. If I were reviewing the whole menu, my rating would be lower. If you like cheap wine, dine in - you will rarely find lower priced glasses."}
{"text":"I usually order lunch delivered from this location and they are punctual, food is good. However I ordered a Chicken Parmesan sandwich on April 25, it was delivered promptly as usual, but the chicken was burned, tasted old and stringy. Quality check obviously didn't happen since they put the marinara on it anyway. DO NOT order the Chicken Parm, you will be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Per the usual. Service is horrible. The only reason they are in business is a lack of options.  5 people in the place. And have been waiting an hour for a thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"I like this pizza joint. The food is consistently good.  I've had both thin crust and Chicago style deep dish. I've also had the lasagna and it was good!  They have a great happy hour and we love going to watch the Vegas Golden Knights!"}
{"text":"I've had Rosatis before and the food is OK in my opinion. I think they are a little over priced. I had it delivered so I can't comment on the restaurant. The food was delivered fast. I ordered a Connolly and thought it was OK nothing special but the fish and chips where good. Overall I would try them again but not my first choice."}
{"text":"I love their thin crust pizza but it would be perfect if when you asked for well done it was.  Other then that, great tasting!  Great chicken sandwhich, just how I like it hot and thin, breaded to perfection.  Def the BEST of their locations but also suggest dining in, delivery can be slow and not as good if it gets cold.  Plus they are super friendly when you go in!!"}
{"text":"Renee was the bartender and server on Friday evening 8/4 and when we came in we asked politely if we could sit at an unoccupied table. She said she still needed to bus the table but we could sit anywhere else. The other two table options we had (small restaurant) were either the corner in the back next to a service door and with little room due to the other tables around it being occupied or a table next to the window that was in the sun which would have been uncomfortable. I told her we would not mind waiting and did for several minutes. That's not the issue, she then began to do her rounds asking if people needed refills, making small talk, AND serving other guests that had come in after us. Clearly being petty and taking her time on purpose, she also had another employee walk behind the bar and instead of asking for help she casually poured a beer for a guy that just sat down. I've been a server for 7 years and can't fathom how someone with that sort of attitude is allowed to represent her company."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service.

You walk in and they act like your disrupting them.

I don't say thank you or even appreciate your business.

Most of the food is decent, the prices are way too high.

I paid $50 bucks for 2 large pieces and they were not worth that price.

But being treated the way they do every time I have gone in there I wont go again.

Pizza Hut has better respect for the customers and they don't charge like this.

I would think for the price I should be treated like a King!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza to our hotel on thanksgiving for my family. It came quickly, was exactly what we ordered and the pizza was really good. Only reason for the 4 instead of 5 is the veggie pizza didn't have many vegetables on it."}
{"text":"Seriously.  Pretty good food, but the amount of time you have to wait, whether pick up or carry out, is INSANE!  Ordered dinner from GrubHub at 8:00.  Still waiting at 9:15, which is ridiculous, even IF they have to kill the cow to make the meat and cheese.  Get it together---your food's really not THAT good."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - DO NOT GO!  Ordered a large pizza and bread sticks for pick-up and was told that it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I showed up in exactly 20 minutes and the girl at the counter said that they \"forgot to make the pizza\" but that they \"caught it\" and asked if I would mind waiting 5 minutes.  I said, no problem.  After 5 minutes the same girl said that they \"forgot again\" and asked me to wait another 15 minutes.  Since I was with kids I said that I couldn't wait and to just deliver it.  I called to check the status after waiting over an hour since I left the restaurant.  They said \"it will get there when the driver gets there\".  I explained the situation and the guy said again that \"it will get there when the driver gets there\".  To this point, it has been one hour and forty minutes since I ordered 1 large pizza and bread sticks and  it is still NOT here.  I will update if/when is shows.

I can't make this up.  12 minutes after writing the 1st post, the delivery guy finally got here and they forgot the bread sticks.  Called and finally got the manager on the phone.  He had to \"cash out a driver\" and put me on hold.  After 6 minutes he finally came back and I had to recap the ordeal because it had \"been a crazy night\".  I recapped the ordeal for him, said that I didn't want anything in return and made sure that he knew that it was me that put the YELP review in tonight."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery when out of town at a hotel. I had never tried deep dish pizza. It was delivered fast, hot and soooooo good!"}

Wings also outstanding--we got spicy garlic. Also started with zuccini. Ok....now we sound like fatties....but I'm just preggers. Meal brought to you by #22weeks."}

Ordered food online.. food got here 2 hours later...  when I called them and asked the girl she claimed the fax was broken... then said GRUB HUB should of called me to inform me that it was running late???  Really?   The best part is when the food arrived THE DELIVERY GIRL SAID I HAVE TO PAY CASH!!  WTF?  I showed her my receipt when I ordered it and the payment.. even showed my BOA account the funds being withdrawn..  I would say these people got to get it together but I'm done with these guys.  Sad I was ordering pretty often and always giving them over 15% tip....lost a good consistent patron"}
{"text":"SO HERE IS THE TRICK- I called and asked the price for 18\" pizza,the lady asked if I want the deal or just a pizza? I asked her what is the deal?
She said $25.90 for 18\" and you get 12\" for free.
And I asked what did you mean pizza only? So she told me the 18\" pizza only without the deal is $25.90! Ahh sound the same why not to take the deal right? SO YOU WRONG! I CALLED AFTER 20 min and asked what is the price for 18\" pizza -this time she didn't mention any deal and she said $19.90!!! SO TYE FREE PIZZA FOR THE \"deal\" ITS NOT REALLY FREE YOU ARE PAYING FOR That! Why to lie??"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the way home from work to pick up some pizza for dinner. When you walk in you instantly smell the delicious hot pizzas coming out of the ovens. Ordered 2 different pizzas and didn't wait too long. I was too hungry at the time of ordering to look over the menu for long but I'm not a big fan of thin crust normally however it was still good nonetheless. I'll have to brush up on the menu and I am sure I will be picking up pizza from here again in the future."}
{"text":"Called to order pizza for delivery and quoted an hour wait.  Pizza arrived before hour was up but pizza was made wrong and they forgot the second pizza.  Tried to give this location one last chance.  For what you pay here the pizza sucks.  Do yourself a favor and visit Buddyz pizza up Val Vista-  you will not be disappointed.  Will be picking up pizza there from now on instead of waiting for crappy delivery.  Manager didn't even make 1% of an effort to make things right."}
{"text":"My husband loves Oregano's, but I like Rosati's better.  I enjoy the pizza sauce and THEY DELIVER.  Two large single to double toping pizzas run about $40.  Two larges will feed four to six hungry adults."}
{"text":"Terrible. We were so hungry when we got here and ended up waiting over 20 mins for 2 sandwiches. We are 1 of 2 tables. My Italian sub has 3 slices of meat on it and my husband's fries are limp and leaked grease. We're still hungry and headed to a drive thru."}
{"text":"Rosati's never disappoints! It's my #1 choice for catering meetings at the office and my families #1 choice for dinner! Their pizza is so tasty (Try the DoubleDough crust) and they have so many other options as well! Amazing stuffed burgers, creamy pasta dishes, salads, wraps, and so much more! We usually stop by and pick up our order but they offer quick delivery for when we're feeling lazy. The staff is always very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The dining room is always spotless and has a nice relaxed atmosphere. Great work Rosati's crew!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked on this pizza! Love it. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"Too expensive and not worth it. I was waiting for a pie when a man came in to pick up his order of two pies and some side dish. $50?? For some dough, sauce and cheese...really? 

When I went home and ate the pizza, I was disappointed. It wasn't anything special. 

Go to Barro's across the street. Much better."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from Rosati's for the first time. We had pizza and wings and I'm ecstatic. I'm an old fart that lives in a 55+ community and I'm thinking they don't get many orders from this neighborhood, but THEY SHOULD!! The crust was great (thin), the sauce was great, the delivery was quick with a very friendly and nice young man with a smile arriving at the door. I recently moved to Mesa, and have been looking for a good pizza delivery option, and I just found it!!"}
{"text":"I wish I would give this location ZERO stars. The customer service and their ability to solve and even want to deal with problems is the absolute worst.
We found this location about a year and a half ago, have gone regularly since we like the food, and have even taken our out-of-town relatives to this location.  Everything was fine, until they really hit rock bottom for us.
Event #1:
We mistakenly ordered online on Easter Sunday (which, in the words of THEIR staff, should not have happened in the first place).  Drove 5 miles to find out they're closed.  Dumb mistake on our part - no harm, foul, we just need them to cancel the order so our card doesn't get charged.  We call first thing the next day and the owner AND one of their staff members assures us they cancelled the order and our card would not be charged.  What happened next?  Of course, our card got charged anyway, another phone call to a manager that didn't want to deal with us, and it still took almost TWO WEEKS for our money to go back into our account.
Event #2:
After the Easter situation, we were more than reserved to go back to this location, but, we're all about second chances.  So I phone order something, so the significant other can pick it up.  Simple - pizza +cannolis. He's almost already home when he looks, and NO CANNOLIS.  Again, another phone call to hear the, apparent, motto at this place, \"How would you like me to handle it?\" - I'm sorry, YOU are the business owner, I am the customer, why do I have to figure out to rectify YOUR mistake?  They \"would offer delivery, but we have a delivery charge\" (WHAT? For something YOU messed up on?), but, \"Oh we don't deliver to your area, anyway.\" Great way to solve the problem.  
We will NEVER EVER come back to this location and discourage anyone to go to this location at all.  I really hope the other locations in town are not as horrible at serving the previously loyal customers they have."}
{"text":"we've been coming here for 3 years now. it used to be our go to pizza and wing spot, now not so much. they recently changed management and it has gone down hill badly. it used to be we walked in the door and were happily greeted, made you feel welcome.  Now it just feels awkward and judgemental. our last experience was horrible. First lets start with the service.  we ordered a pitcher of beer and before we could order our 3 year old daughter a drink the server just cut us off and walked away. when she came back with our beers we asked her for a kids drink and she forgot about it. had to remind her a second time when she came to take our food order. Ordered pizza, wings and frys. we received our frys and wings first, which is fine, but didnt have any silverware or plates on the table. had to flag down our server to get us plates. when she returned she only brought enough for 2, again neglecting our daughter . we had to flag her down again to get a 3rd plate setting and also ketchup. my wife bit into 2 wings and both were still very raw on the inside, blood was still coming out. flagged down our server again and let her know of the issue. she looked at us like there was nothing wrong and asked  what do you guys want. we told her we dont want raw wings. she removed the wings from our table and had the kitchen re fry the same wings. when we received them they were not re tossed  and extremly dry. all they did was drizzle cold buffalo sauce on top of the wings.also didnt receive  a replacement for the 2 raw wings. mind you their a dollar something a piece. we always  tip 20 percent, the server was lucky she got what we left her. its slowly getting worst and worst. not worth the 60 dollars we spent. also its not like they were busy. there were only  2/3 tables in the restraunt at the time. they do have a hidden gem, Alix is an awsome server. this server was an older new lady. first time seeing her."}
{"text":"Was really good pizza!! Was a little upset when I ordered a pizza and it was made thin crust and they hadn't even asked me what kind of crust I wanted. The food was delicious tho!!"}
{"text":"Amazing deep dish pizza!!! Family owned and operated...the owners and the kids are absolutely charming! Best place to get a great pizza in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"What a joke!  I ordered zucchini and wings.  The approximate time was 45 minutes.  I arrived about 5 minutes before the order was to be ready and was told about 5 more minutes.  After another 30 minutes of waiting, I asked about my order only to be told they didn't have zucchini and hadn't started the wings yet.  The girl at the counter stated they were going to call me to let me know.  So. 1:15 for that.  They seem to have the brains of a rock.  If their food is good I will never know it.  This is the worst experience ever.  If you dare to try it, good luck."}
{"text":"Rosati's at 1035 N Ellsworth has expended into disappointment the supposed Chicago Deep Dish is not DEEP it was a year ago but they put out mislabeled menus and its a 1/2 inch total the cheese should be thick. But they are trying to skimp. Pass on them try another Rosati's or Uno's, Lou Maldodia are great"}
{"text":"This Rosati's has had new owners now for the past 4-5 months. The old owner made this place more special to eat at. The new owners are not on top of the pizzeria that they have taken over. First of all I ate there this past Friday 8\12 with a co-worker of mine. We went over for lunch ordered a medium Monster pizza and two cokes for dine in. We ordered the pizza right after we walked in the door at 12:15.  We sat down we were not told how long before our pizza would be up and ready. We sat down at the table. I did a scan of patrons in restaurant. There was one guy sitting behind us and he had got two slices that are ready right there for those who do not want a whole pizza. There was not a single soul more in this place. I thought okay we should have our pizza on the table in 15-20 minutes. I have eaten at many pizzerias over the years and no pizza I have had to wait more than 20 minutes for it to arrive at the table. Well, here we are waiting. So, in walks two women that each wanted two slices of pepperoni out the heated carousel case. There was not any. They asked the owner \"will you be making another cheese pizza\". The owner looks up at the clock on the wall and replies \"no, I am not making any more pizzas today for the ready by the slice carousel.\" It was 12:30! This is the lunch hour and she is willing to risk losing two customers a total of $16 dollars because she is not willing to make a cheese pizza! You get 2 slices and a drink for $7.50 before tax.  Meanwhile, we are still waiting for our pizza and 15 minutes passed, then 20 mins, then 30 mins. We got our dang pizza 35 minutes after we placed our order after walking straight through the door!! There was no one else in the restaurant. The phone rang once for a to-go-order. No business and 35 minute wait time for a pizza. Come on Rosati's. I know you can do better! Your place off Shea has your pizza to go out of the oven in 18 minutes timed and they were super busy on a Friday night........not worth the wait. The pizza was good but wait was outrageous for a simple pie."}
{"text":"We have been longtime fans of Rosati's and were really happy when one opened in DC Ranch. The ordering and service were perfect. Then came the pizza. OMG. it was tasteless! Took it home and even tried getting it hot. Still no flavor. Sure hope they fix the problem soon."}
{"text":"Never coming back! Spend your money and your time somewhere else worth it. 

1. Not all items we ordered were in our take out order bag; they wanted to credit us next time we eat there (lol that's not happening) but will give us a refund if we go in 

2. Slow service, 40 mins, store not too busy inside. They said it would be 20-25 minutes. At least they should tell us it's long so we have the chance to decide if we want to eat there or not, otherwise it's misrepresentation and frustration. 
I do understand they make delivery and carry out orders too. 

3. Not tasty, sauce very salty. Not that good of food. All that wait and it wasn't even good. 

4. Made my mom sick that night."}
{"text":"service was horrible, very unprofessional, pizza and hot dogs were awful, i will never go here again. they are wrecking the Rosati's name. alot of workers that had no clue about anything, wierd that the soda machine placed by the bathroom in thier dining area and mops and such were aslo in the dining room, waited for over an hour for crappy food. horrble horrible horrible. hope they dont stay in business,"}
{"text":"Another poor review.  Since my last review I've ordered Rosatis maybe 4 times.  This time around I got 2 burnt pizzas.  I ordered the deep dish pizza and the cheese thin crust.  Both were burnt.  The deep dish was charcoal looking burnt.   I cannot believe they allowed someone to send a pizza out like that.  Had to wait ANOTHER hour for a NEW pizza.  They came an hour later with the 2 new pizzas and we gave them the burnt ones.

My significant other had ordered it this time and I wonder if it had been me had they denied to replace the pizza since last time I had complained too much.  I should have taken a picture but didn't care to write a review.  At least he was there to verify that Rosatis has dropped the ball again."}
{"text":"We love Rosatis! We used to get delivery and takeout from the location on Baseline and 24th street. The pizza is great, pastas are pretty good and they have great Italian beef. If your looking for a REAL pizza, try the Rosati's monster. Bonus***The Entertainment Book has a few coupons for 50% off of a pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got many bad reviews but I love the pizza here, especially the crispy 5\" one with all the topping I can get. $0.70 wings Tuesday, hmmm yummy."}
{"text":"Rosati's pizza is the business as far as pizza and wings are concerned! I know quite a few people have left negative reviews regarding Rosati's, but I would be hard pressed to take the nay-sayer's word for it for a few reasons: One, some one commented that they waited 20 minutes just for drinks- Well, if you did, that would be because the drink fountains outsmarted you.. O_O Here is the low on how Rosati's works- It's like a combination between \"serve yourself\" and \"full service\". The drink fountain is right next to where you grab straws, forks, napkins, etc.  So, you take your cup, fill, enjoy, rinse and repeat. It would be the equivalent of waiting 20 minutes for drinks at Panda Express. (On a side note, I'm not intentionally being rude, there may be extenuating circumstances that preventeed the drink pourage, just putting a realistic timeline out there showing it's not the norm to wait for anything while there.) Most of the kids working there are just that: Kids.  You don't go to Pizza Hut expecting 5 star service, just as you wouldn't go there expecting a host in a tux to seat you. With that said, let's move on to the current review!! =)

Food: The portions are GINORMOUS! For the lunch Slice special, you get what amounts to a quarter of an entire pizza and drink for $3! The crust is made fresh there, and my personal favorite is the Cheese slice with all the herbs and garlic sprinkled in and on. Also on Tuesdays they have 50 cent wings, but not those dinky little wings you get from most places. These are CHICKEN WINGS! lol, about twice the size of a normal wing. I would be afraid to be in a dark alley with the chicken these wings came from; He apparently hit the gym often. And the sauces are DELICIOUS! My fave sauces are the mild and the honey bbq. And the homemade Spumoni ice cream is a MUST!

Service: I usually only go during lunch since my office is nearby, so I only know 2 of the girls there and they have always been completely awesome to me. I am a friendly person by nature and I have been known to become \"BFF\" with random people buying Ketchup (long story), so I am inclined to think every one is a sweetheart. That being said, my coworkers are a different story, but they also agree that the girls there are so accommodating and nice! A good example of that would be from today. My coworker wanted to try their 50 cent wings, but didn't know which of the 6 flavors she would like, so she actually ordered ONE OF EACH FLAVOR! lol, Yes, you read right, she ordered one chicken wing in each of the 6 flavors. While also ordering some \"custom\" fries. (We didn't care for the Cheese fries with the cheese sauce on them, so she asked for Pizza Fries- fries with the pizza sauce and mozzarella baked on. She's also had them take fries and put mozzarella and cheddar and bake them too.) The thing is, they never complained, never said \"We can't do that\", or anything! They have always humored all of her crazy whims and ideas, and made whatever she wanted with a smile! They are always so friendly and sweet, always happy to be of service and go the extra mile! The girl with the piercings is especially nice!  There have been times where i have seen people ask what something tastes like, and rather than just explain an abstract, she has been known to give them freebies to try, even to the point of giving an entire dessert free for some one to try. Try doing that some where else and see if they will give you a free cheesecake to sample, or accept making 6 wings each in a different sauce. Customer service like that unfortunately just doesn't happen every day, especially at a \"fast food\" joint.

Prices: The prices can vary. Like I said, you can get an entire quarter of a pizza and drink for $3, or you can buy a 15lb pizza (I swear they really do weigh that much!) for anywhere between $12-$20. Some of the pizzas can be expensive depending on the toppings and crust, but they are SOOOOO filling! My son can eat his weight in pizza (Read: he can eat half a large pizza from Pizza Hut in one setting) yet he was STUFFED after just one slice of a Rosati's pizza, so the price more than justifies itself. Plus, once you get to know them, they will go out of their way to find coupons and discounts for you. =)

Overall, in my opinion, Rosati's is the only chain pizza joint I'll eat at any more; on a scale of 1 to 5, they definitely get 5 Nomnoms from me!"}
{"text":"We really have enjoyed Rosati's. Every one in a while we have issues with the sauce (or lack there of) in the pasta. But they have rectified the situation when we have issues. It's yummy but a little expensive compared to other pizza places."}
{"text":"OK, down and dirty: You want Chicago-style pizza, Italian beef, and ribs in Vegas, and you don't want to have Lou Malnati's deliver overnight?  This is it. This particular restaurant is getting ready to close and reopen on Warm Springs and Eastern with a full sit down restaurant and bar.  I just wish there was one closer to me on the east side of town."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza.  Long time to have your order ready.  I will always come back but my order had never been ready for pickup.  Carry out or delivery only"}
{"text":"First of all, I freely admit that I am a huge Papa Del's fan.  However, I'm always in search of other great Chicago-style pizza in the Chambana area as well, so I decided to give Rosati's a try after reading some decent reviews and seeing a few pictures of their deep-dish pizzas online.  Unfortunately, my Rosati's experience was mostly disappointing.  

First, my friend and I arrived at the restaurant and ordered a medium deep dish pizza and two drinks for dine in (about $20 in total).  We were then given cheap Styrofoam cups, paper/plastic plates, and plastic utensils.  I'm sorry, but if Rosati's is going to offer a dine in service, they should at least provide better quality utensils, glasses, plates, etc. (especially since deep dish pizza is very messy and can be hard to cut- even with proper silverwear).

About 40 minutes later, our pizza was brought out to our table.  The wait time wasn't really an issue- I'm used to that from Papa Del's.  Great Chicago style pizza takes time to make... unfortunately the pizza we received from Rosati's was less than great.  In fact, it was probably the greasiest pizza I have ever attempted to eat.  Also, the cheese and sauce both had an artificial taste (reminded me a bit of Pizza Hut- aka far from 'natural'-tasting ingredients).  The best thing the pizza had going for it was the crust- which was comparable to Papa Del's and traditional Chicago-style pizza in general.  However, that wasn't enough to save it from the grease overload and artificial taste that made my friend and I give up after eating one piece each.

So yeah, Rosati's was not for me.  If you decide to give it a try, I wouldn't recommend dining in due to the poor quality utensils (though the dining environment itself is alright).  When it comes to the pizza itself, expect A LOT of grease and a taste that doesn't quite match real Chicago-style pizza (though the crust is close)."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant last night (me on crutches). Waited several minutes to be seated, and when no one acknowledged us, we seated ourselves on the patio. Two different waitresses came out to check on other tables, but never came over to us. My husband went inside to try to tell someone (anyone!) that we were waiting, to no avail. After 20 minutes, we got up and left. There is no excuse for this, especially when the place is almost empty. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We visited this place in January (2016) with some friends and have been wanting to go back to try the pizza.  We were close to the Ray road location so we decided to stop in with a couple of friends.  Unfortunately they were remodeling the kitchen so the menu was VERY limited - pizza, salad and wings - nothing else.  We thought that maybe we could get the garlic cheese bread since they use the pizza oven to make it - nope.  We were told that the cooks didn't have time to prep anything.  This made me wonder if I had ordered it, how long would it have been sitting around before I got it?  Just something to think about.  Anyway we ordered the meat thin crust pizza.  I was just ok.  First off, when I think of thin crust I think of crisp and crunchy.  Not the case.  It was very crisp around the edges only.  The center of the pizza was barely brown and very soft.  If I would have known this fact I would have ordered it extra done.  Second, it seems like all of the cheese is piled in the middle.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good cheesy pizza, but not all in one spot.  There was plenty of cheese, I wish it had been spread out a little more.  Lastly, the pizza seemed extremely salty.  I know that it only had meat and cheese on it but I have had other meat pizzas before and they didn't even come close to the salt content of this pizza.
Just as our first visit, the service was painstakingly slow.  The other thing that I don't care for about this place is that the tables are so close together that you can't move without bumping someone.  If you want to use the restroom and are sitting in the corner, as we were, you have to walk clear up to the front of the place to walk down another aisle to get to the door which was literally 15 ft from our table.  The whole way dodging wait staff and trying not to ram into other people sitting down trying to enjoy there dinner.  The place is also very loud.  I am not sure how they are allowed to cram that many people into such a small space, but they do.
Anyway, most likely won't go back.  Sorry to say but pizza joints are a dime a dozen and I am positive that there are better ones out there somewhere, it just takes time."}
{"text":"Wow!  Pizza was great and beer was cold.  Definitely coming back to take advantage of all of the games on their big screen TVs.
Happy hour pricing is amazing and great menu."}
{"text":"Love the calzones! FULL of cheese! I can't have red sauce so having it come on the side is perfect. Cold beer and cooked and seasoned perfect every time. A calzone will feed 2 no problem. The location on Bell Rd is awesome too if you're a spots fan. Great big tv to catch what's on!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm sad to see all the negative experiences people here on Yelp have had.  I have to say that my husband and I love Rosati's.  We've tried just about every other pizza place in the area, yet we keep coming back here.  Why?  Well...the pizza is great.  We usually order the thin-crust pizza but the toppings vary depending on our mood--I'm a big fan of the Veggie; my husband loves his custom-made with lots of meat.  Either way, it's delicious, and we've never been disappointed with the pizza.  As far as their other food, though...well, hit or miss.  Husband loves the Cheef roast beef sandwich with hot peppers on garlic bread, and says it's great about 90% of the time.  I occasionally enjoy an antipasto but usually have to ask for extra meats and cheeses because otherwise, you mostly get a big bowl of iceberg lettuce.  So this rating mostly for the pizza--we love it.

As far as the service, though...that's another thing entirely.  If we didn't like the pizza so much, the service would chase us elsewhere, honestly.  On the phone they are curt, rude, and generally act like they don't want to be bothered (though the delivery people are usually pretty decent).  One night after giving my order on the phone, I mentioned I had a coupon, and the guy actually said, \"well you have to give it to me before the f**k'n order!\"  And, I mean, I'm not bothered by cursing, but jeez, in that situation, it was pretty out of line.

In a nutshell...we're pretty laid back people who can put up with snotty service for great pizza.  We'll continue to go there, at least for a while."}
{"text":"Okay, Let me just say....I'm not sure if it was food poisoning, or I coincidentally came down with a stomach bug 4 hours after eating their pizza.....but after my 36 hour adventure with my toilet and the bathroom floor, I can't say I'm willing to give this place another shot....not to mention the pizza really wasn't even worth my misery.

So, the pizza itself. I got the spinach trio (comes with spinach, tomato and feta cheese). It was a thin crust pizza, and there was waaaaaayyyyyyy too much mozzarella on this thing. The cheese was at least 1/4 inch think. This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get. Plus, there was hardly any spinach at all on the pizza. 

On the plus side, the girl working the counter was very peppy and nice. 

So, if your going to try this place, I recommend skipping the spinach trio...maybe it was the feta that poisoned me.....good luck, I hope you have a better experience that I....if you're the brave type."}
{"text":"The thin crust pie is very tasty flaky texture. Toppings are plentiful. Over all a good pizza. We've also tried the wings. They are meaty and good sized. Lots of flavor."}
{"text":"I still like & will continue to order however my experience on 2.29.16 was slightly disappointing. Why? I was quoted 45 minutes...but should've been advised closer to an hour & fifteen. No biggie. It happens. 
I bite into my delicious perfectly salted LUKE WARM fries...
Sigh...when did ownership change? Please if you're going to perpetrate that you're from Chicago...follow my advice...white onion on the hot dogs & chop the onion don't slice it. :)"}
{"text":"We had our pizza delivered to a friends house. I am pretty sure that this is the location he ordered from. The deep dish pizza was very good. The crust was light and airy, so we didn't feel like we ate 5 pounds of bread. We ordered the \"monster,\" and the toppings were excellent."}
{"text":"We ate here Friday night and have nothing but excellent things to say. I ordered something on the menu that everyone at the table liked but that I didn't. The waitress asked me if I was enjoying my food and I told her that I really didn't. She took the plate and immediately brought me a new dish of delicious Ravioli and only charged me half. The customer service is always great! They always make us feel important (remembering my sons funny t-shirts). Also, the house beer is super yummy!"}
{"text":"Chicago-style.  Pizza, Italian beef, Chicago dogs.  I drive to the one in Henderson from Sunrise Mountain just for a fix.  It's either this, or Lou Malnoti's overnight direct from Chicago, and this is cheaper.  The only Chicago-style pie better in Vegas was the old Pie Town."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and decided to try this place out because they offered chicago style pizza.  We were greeted immediately and seated.  The menu said to allow atleast 45 minutes for chicago pizza but it really only took about 30 minutes.  We had calamari and wings to entertain us while we waited, both were good...the wings were better than the calamari though.  Finally got our pie and it was huge!  We only at a slice each and ended up taking the rest to go, it was delish and if I'm ever in town again I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. Horrible. You are better off going to a grocery store and buying the cheapest pizza there and it will still be better. I'd get little Caesar's over this and I'm not a super fan of them. We had double layers of bread. Very little cheese when I ordered extra. It just wasn't good. Sad :/"}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place! First off, My husband and I decided to give this place a shot since he's had such great experience with the Rosati's in West Phoenix. We were so unsatisfied with the food and service to say the least. 
     We ordered our food at 6pm and food was not ready until 730pm! We ordered the Chicago style pizza that tasted like card board box it came in. We also ordered fried mushrooms-we paid $6 and only 5 came in the box. 
     I'm not one to write bad reviews, but this place was very disappointing. I feel robbed to be honest. I'm giving this place 1 star since there is no option to leave 0 stars!"}
{"text":"if you're going for deep dish pizza, you better be ready to be there for an hour. 35 minute wait for deep dish. But it was well worth the wait. pizza came out, a little buttery and a very crispy crust. I guess it depends on how thick, you want the pizza to be, I have seen places that are really, really deep, this one is pretty much an average size. Sauce was great, hint of sweet to it., shared a small pepperoni and half mushroom, I had the mushroom side. It was very filling, only had 2 slices and I was full, maybe because we devoured the garlic bread, which was very good. It was good. But im not exactly sure if this was authentic chicago style deep dish."}
{"text":"Stopped in here twice now. First time for a salad. Second time for a carry out pizza.

Salad came in a plastic container and was packed full. Very fresh! Came with dressing on the side.

Second visit we got a large thin crust with different toppings. Counter person was very courteous. Pizza was hot and made to order. I like the thinness of the crust and the sauce was flavorful. Just enough! 

Much better than the corporate $5 pizza! Will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"a cheese calzone is $7.99 i added extra toppings such as italian sausage, spinach, ricotta and pepperoni calzone.
i thought it was ok, it could of had alot more flavor being i added extra toppings. the total came up to $15. i ordered for delivery and it took a really long time."}
{"text":"Wanted to order a simple Bruchetta to go.  Didn't think it was much to ask.  I was told by the unfriendly person behind the desk that they didn't have the right portion size for the order, and needed to make more.  She followed that up with telling me that she didn't know what went in Bruchetta in order to make it.  Left confused, I simply asked for my money back.  I don't understand how a restaurant runs when people do not know how to make the food?  Especially when you order something Italian... from an Italian place! First attempt at this place, and sadly will be my last."}
{"text":"We are originally from the NW Suburbs of Chicago so we are very familiar with Rosati's.  The Power Rd location is our go to place at least once a week.  It's amazing to call and have Tammy answer the phone and say Hi Laura.  The food is AMAZING.  I highly recommend calling this location and ordering.  Not only is the food amazing the delivery drivers are prompt and you get hot food."}
{"text":"First and Last Order

Ordered a pizza using Rosati's ONLINE form - received a completely different pizza (even though the receipt with the pizza was correct).  Called to report and was told that they could bring me the correct pizza or I could get a free one at a later date.  Called today to get my \"replacement\" pizza and was told that they could not confirm the deal and could not deliver a pizza.  However, if I wanted to pick-it up, they would go ahead and give me a replacement pizza.  Interesting.... My first exposure to Rosati's is poor - first the mix-up and then the excuse for not refunding me..."}
{"text":"We had a large order for a party: 8 pizzas & chicken Alfredo  (delivery).  Everything was perfect! We got everything we ordered and on time.  We also got a free salad and bread.  The chicken Alfredo was full of flavor like their pizzas, the pasta had sundried tomatoes and herbs in the sauce, yum!  The cost was higher than some but the flavor was worth it!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the deep dish pizza my 2nd deep dish pizza and I must say it was very good, I love the location as you can easily pass it up if you aren't paying attention, service was great while I waited for take out, Overall  no complaints 2 thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Rosati's has the worst customer service.  I could not believe the way I was treated today.  I never post anything negative but I could not believe how I was treated today by the manager.  They delivered the wrong pizza so I called to have them deliver the right pizza.  The person addressing my issue on the phone was basically telling me that he couldn't do anything about it.  So I asked to speak to the manager and he told me, \"I am the manager and i'm very busy right now.\"  This is ridiculous!!  I will never place an order with Rosati's and was going to use them for catering next month for a party I'm having but will go to a different Italian restaurant.   It's very sad to have insensitive people running restaurants ...Do the owners not know what's going on?"}
{"text":"Firstly, I don't hand out five stars casually.  Secondly, I'm going to first comment on a few reviews that I just read.  And I'm going to do it in my own review space instead of clicking on the other reviews because it's more fun:

Jillin W.:  Dissatisfied with but justifying a long wait time for her order, Jillian submits, \"...it's probably made from scratch\".  Um, yeah Jill, this is a pizza restaurant.  There is prep involved (yeast added to flour and bubbling of tomatoes- perhaps at a central site, etc.) but I suppose it depends on where in the process you define the word \"made\".  A frozen box pizza is actually made from scratch somewhere.  For these review purposes, I'm going to sub the words \"assembled and baked onsite\" as \"made from scratch\".  I'm sorry that Jillian wasn't satisfied with her purchase at one of the best pizza stores in the world but I'm not judging her.  I'd be mad too if my Easy-Bake Oven light burned out and the LED bulb replacement won't get hot enough and I had to ask my Mom to drive me for take out.

Thomas S.:  \"...deep dish pizza under-cooked...\".  Hmmm.  Thank you for this Thomas.  I kill for bread, crust, anything with gluten and yeast- but I've yet to try this at Rosati's.  In fact, I may be confusing deep-dish with double-dough if in fact those options are available.  I simply couldn't risk a Rosati's visit on anything but the regular thin and I'm a Chicago suburbanite (Wheaton).  Speaking of....does anybody remember Peter Piper Pizza (no, not that one) located just across Gary Avenue from the Wheaton Bowl at Geneva Rd. back in the 60's?  My  memory tongue can taste the fennel and crumbled sausage.  The store is long gone but the shack remained when I was home last several years ago. (Hmmm, Rosati boys' competition; Mr. Piper's body ever found?  Connection?  Coincidence?  Yummy Pizza?  Just asking.)

Becki S.:  She stabbed her own son's hand for making a move on her meatball.  I died laughing and I forgive her for spelling her name like that.  Maybe she could bring her Barbi's over some time.  I've got the tree house.

My review:  Small green salad, med. sized sausage thin crust, Italian beef sandwich, sm. order of hot wings:  Home run, home run, home run, home run, respectively.

It's been too long since my last visit and I was just very impressed.  Sandwich was especially better than I recall from long ago- just wonderful- served with deliciously oily hot (by choice) peppers and the fancy word for \"ahhh juice\" that I can never spell; wings were perfectly hot, spicy and vinegar-ee; pizza piping hot and succulent, packaged, of course, on the crust screen to keep it from becoming part of the box.  Brilliant and rare in the to-go world.

Pleasant, eager young lady took my phone order for pickup; I arrived maybe 5 minutes before suggested wait time and everything had just been assembled and bagged.  A familiar looking dark-haired gentleman brought the order to the counter as the young lady processed my Amex card.

As I drove home thinking, \"Where have I seen that guy?  On TV maybe?  Some years ago?\" 

BAM!  It hit me:  The flour'd clothing of the dark-haired person of interest wanted for questioning in ...wait for it...wait for it...

THE MISSING PIPER CASE !!!!!

Whatever.  The meal was awesome.  Extra fennel.  Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Arizona, which I guess isn't saying much since Arizona is really lacking in good pizza. I love their Chicago deep dish and thin crust, though I think I prefer their thin crust. Their thin crust reminds me of one of my long-time favourite pizza places in Chicago. The people who work here have been nothing but awesome the two times I've been here."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever. My pizza was supposed to have extra cheese it didn't have ANY cheese . . I got pebbles for sausage! When I called to have it replaced I was dismissed. We will never eat here again I wrote a review on FB and this is how everyone else felt about it too. Attached are the pics of the pizza I received. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"I come here for the one thing they make that is great Chicago style deep dish pizzas I don't order any of the other items on the menu so I can only give a review on the deep dish pizza after trying all the different combinations of toppings I've settled on the Rosati's monster its what I order whenever I go there"}
{"text":"Great location. Good pizza. Good cheesy bread and boasted chicken."}
{"text":"Wow finally some basic Italian food in Madison that isn't flavorless and bland !  One of my few regrets in moving to this area is that much of the local flair is bland.  I was sad that Olive Garden was my favorite moderate priced Italian restaurant.  That is until I tried Rosati's.  I am not looking for authentic, I don't know if this real Chicago fare but I do like how it tastes.  I am pleased with the service and love the fact that you get a bowl of salty popcorn when your seated.  I hope more franchises open in the area."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! They do a great job and are always very polite. We live in the neighborhood right behind them and order from here often. Never a bad experience and the best part.....no snotty spoiled kids like you can get at a lot of pizza places or Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Fool me once.........I've tried this place twice and both times the service has been sooooooo...slow.

This time we sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon to grab a bite to eat and have a beer as we just got back in town.  The bartender thought he was on top of it but service was slow.  He used profanity in his conversation with children in the room.  He was giving out free drinks to some of the patrons.  
The temperture was hotter in the bar than outside.  Took us a long time to get our check though the barkeep was standing in front of us the whole time and seemed not be able to multi-task.

In summary....slow, sweaty, and unsatisfactory!"}
{"text":"Great choice!! We decided to try this restaurant while staying at Country Inn & Suites in Deer Valley. The delivery was super fast, the order was correct and complete, and the food was excellent. We had the Rosati's salad, the combo appetizer platter, and jumbo pepperoni pizza slices. The salad was fresh and delicious, loaded with all the ingredients listed, and big enough to easily feed 3 people. The jumbo pepperoni slices were huge, the crust homemade and tasty, and the cheese and pepperoni were some of the best I've tasted in quite a while. Now the combo appetizer was kinda pricey when I ordered it but so worth it! It was fried heaven in a box! Huge wings, crispy battered onion rings, fried mushrooms, cheese sticks, and jalapeno poppers. Everything was still hot and perfect upon delivery. Thank you for a wonderful meal. Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had.
Wings were ok though 
Service took forever 
Would not be going back there."}
{"text":"So it was a Monday night, the Voice battle rounds were coming on and we were starving...

Wanting to try something new we remembered the Rosati's ad in 89135 magazine and placed an order for delivery online.

I purposefully didn't look up the Yelp reviews for this location (which is generally contrary to my usual pre-eating habits) because the order had already been placed and I didn't want to set up expectation (and then possibly be disappointed).

We ordered an X-LG ROSATI'S MONSTER...no olives, no ground beef, add jalepenos. WOW was it good :) My only complaint is that the pizza was a tad soggy towards the middle, simply because there were so many toppings on it. The vegetables were crunchy and fresh and the dough was buttery with nice texture.

Of course, we have tons of leftovers and I look forward to enjoying more Rosati's tonight!"}
{"text":"You've got to try the deep dish pizza. It's a little pricey but its not only tasty and delicious, it's also a meal in and of itself. I'm usually a thin crust fan but I was not disappointed. This is seriously a legit pizza Chicago style and I'm not from Chi-town. However, all my friends from Chi-town recommend Rosati's."}
{"text":"If this pizza was any more expensive I might confuse it with something greater but its not. It takes an hour, at a minimum, to deliver, and they charge 2.00 for every topping. The two pies I ordered looked liked they were hand tossed right in the box. The good thing is that they cut them into tiny square so I feel like I am getting more."}
{"text":"This was my first time calling for delivery with this restaurant and the food was amazing along with the quality, taste, temperature all of these things made it worth the phone call."}
{"text":"We ordered a small classic combo. It was a perfect size for 2. The best pizza we have had in years. 

We are visiting from out of state but make Scottsdale a regular destination. We will definitely order from Rosati's when we visit again!"}
{"text":"I will say one thing I love pizza a lot.  The one problem is that I am lactose intolerant.  I take the pills which allow me to dine on such fine pizza.  
This was a good place to stop and eat this night.  We drove up to the medical center to see our great niece who was born earlier that morning. 

We ordered a pizza that was sausage with half pepperoni also.  It was good.  I love their double dough pizza.  There was some concern since we did show up at 820 and they close at 9.  They seem in a hurry to get us out.  I understand they want to go home too.  The pizza was ready and we stayed a hair past 9pm.  The pizza was excellent.  I really enjoy their sausage a lot.  One of my favourites.  Great place and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Staff was polite and their dining room does have a nice setting, however the deep dish crust is not worth the extra money. The large pizza is huge, as well as the chunks of sausage- it really is quite yummy. I, personally, will get double dough or thin crust next time. Very convenient, right around the corner."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. I ordered a large pepperoni and a medium vegetarian pizza and two small salads and it cost me over $50. The pizza were to be delivered within 45 minutes to an hour and it took an hour and 30 minutes. I opened the boxes to find the thinnest crust I have ever seen on a pizza and they were supposed to be Chicago style. I am not kidding if they were  1/4 inch deep that would be stretching it. There were no identifiable toppings on the pizza except for two pepperoni. Nothing on the vegetarian pizza.
I called to speak with the manager and he was quite rude. I've told me that he was not the one that ordered the pizzas and I could probably get a better pizza in the grocery store. He also asked me to not post a negative review because it would hurt his four children.
I would not recommend this pizza place."}
{"text":"Yet again another 3+hours til I get my pizza. This is ridiculous it's like they don't even care. Oh to make it even better the pizza man delivered my already paid for original pizza to another house. Wtf!!! Not to mention my info was on the receipt he delivered. Bravo Rosatis A+ job you got going on there. Just got food. Yeah the mozzarella sticks and mushrooms were microwave and thrown in a box. Never will I order from here again this is BULLSH*T!!!!"}
{"text":"Dine in seems small with not a lot of tables, the decor is a little outdated, the deep dish pizza takes 40 minutes to cook but we Loved our pizza and the chicken Parmesan was yummy !"}
{"text":"The food was great, though I question if the mushroom appetizer was frozen not homemade, but the rest of the food was fresh and well prepared and presented.

The service was awful.  It was slow, and no one could decide who was going to take our order.  Once the order was in, it took 45 minutes for our food to be delivered.  I would rank it higher, but until they fix their service they are going to have issues."}
{"text":"We've been at many different places for pizza here in Arizona, but none of them measured up until we got to a little hole in the wall named Rosati's. We had Chicago style thin crust 14 inch called the Monster. As much as I hate to do it I have to say a 12 inch would have been good enough for two as I don't want to cause them any loss of profits they deserve. Tasty as all get out and cut into little squares rather than wedge N.Y.style, with tomato slices across the top and plenty of seasoning.
Would have given them all five except for having only two tables inside and two outside with condiments in little packets. Sometimes great things come in small places!

Be aware that this location (on Olive)will not honor the 25% off Yelp coupon"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon, so tried this location for the first time last night. Based on this experience, we won't be back. Placed our order online and it initially said our food would be ready for pickup between 7:25 and 7:35, which seemed reasonable. We then got an update that it wouldn't be ready until 8:20 to 8:30. When we finally picked up the food, I have to say it was disappointing.  As for the pizza, the sauce was good and toppings were OK, but the crust was burnt. The fried zucchini was tasteless and mushy, plus they forgot the side of ranch that we ordered. Based on other reviews, it appears that Rosati's has some quality control issues with some of their locations. Other locations may be good, but I definitely would not recommend this one."}
{"text":"I used to order here 3 years ago and their eggplant parmigiana dinner was good but just tonight picked up an order... OMG 1 inch think eggplant uncooked, who does that?  Disgusting, no wonder they had to close the restaurant side.  I 86ed their phone number off my cell.  Look at the pic... amateurs."}
{"text":"This place has okay food but needs a lot of work in the customer service and time management department. I experienced several issues during my visit. The server took forever to bring our order out from the appetizer to the main meal. They were not bust at all so I don't know what her issue was. I had mozzarella sticks that were delicious even though they were only brought out because I reminded our server about them. The pizza I had was good too and like the sticks took forever to be ready. I know deep dish pizzas can take 45 min to an hour but this went beyond that. Inside the seating was cramped. I'd order from here again but likely it would be a phone order for pick up since I did mostly enjoy the food. I sure didn't like the service I received on the other hand."}
{"text":"Best Deep Dish pizza in town hands down!! I have tried other so called Chicago style pizzerias here in Vegas and none of them come close to home like Rosatis."}
{"text":"Pizza is good...we've ordered lasagna for take out too before and its good. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Fairly new to area but decided to give try based on mixed reviews. If you like deep dish it's fair but does lack flavor. Service was okay nothing memorable. For the $$ I'll keep shopping!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Chicago, and never heard of this place.

I've also lived many places across the U.S., and never found good CHICAGO style deep dish pizza anywhere.

Until, I tried there pizza. It reminds me of authentic Chicago deep dish from home. 

With that said, I don't recommend eating in or eating anything else on the menu. I always get delivery or pick-up, and get anything else from somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to be invited to their pre-opening event today (April 8, 2017) and got to try quite a few of their dishes.  Wings were great, as was the pizza.  We tried both the thin crust and the deep dish.  Both were great but the deep dish really stole the show.  It was awesome.  Cannoli for dessert, and it was a perfect conclusion to a great meal.  We'll be back!

Note, no indoor seating, but looks like it will be perfect for take out or delivery of a great Chicago-style meal."}
{"text":"Oh boy. 

Don't come here. 

Pizza = sad. Too much bread on Italian sausage. Alfredo? Literally all sauce. I like sauce don't get me wrong but there was 3 cups of sauce to one cup of noodles. 

The fries that come with the Italian Sausage? I bet they bought it at the Bashas next door. They were the best part of the order and they still sucked. 

Disappointed. Wont come to this location again."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I also happen to have a Rosati's right down the street from where I live and I have to say this Rosati's blows mine out of the water.  I order from here when I'm visiting my girlfriend's parent's in Arizona and while it's no Chicago-level pizza but it's easily the best pizza I have had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Moving to Phoenix from the suburbs of Chicago is hard enough. So happy to see Rosati's here!! The food was on-time, hot, correct order. To top it all off, the front end staff is very friendly. We have been here three times already. Kids love it!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza.  I've also had the jumbo calzone here, and they weren't kidding about the jumbo part.  For 6.50, that baby could have fed 2 people.  Or one hungry me.  I've only had take-out from here, so I can't say anything about the ambiance.  I didn't even order, so I can't even say anything about the ordering process.  But the food is solid.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here before, and again, it has surpassed my expectations and has always delivered (no pun intended).  I usually only get delivery and that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour, but it's worth the wait.  This time I ordered a stuffed crust pizza - I was expecting more of a sandwich/calzone stuffed pizza, but they basically have cheese and toppings between two layers of crust and then the sauce on the top.  Still pretty delicious, but a lot like Chicago for me, which is not a bad thing. 

Also, I ordered a small batch of wings (spicy garlic) and they were delicious.  It is hard to find good wings from restaurants that don't feature them, but they did a great job!

I usually get their italian beef sandwiches, and they have always been seasoned well and you can get a small cup of au jus on the side for pretty cheap (and you don't necessarily need it).  All in all, their pizza and side items are delicious.  It's also nice to support local rather than do the national chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Just visited for our first time and were pleasantly surprised. Best wings ever and the white pizza with thin crust was great. Gotta try double crust next time. Only minor gripe is I wish they had red peppers. They only had green."}
{"text":"They sent an email to me stating to come to their bar for super bowl Sunday. I called on Friday afternoon to reserve a table for our party. They said it was first come first serve. My party and I showed up for the super bowl and they said the dining and bar was shut down for an engagement party and we could try and fit in the waiting area for take out customers. No tv to even watch the game. We left and now had to scramble around town trying to find a place to watch the game. We came every Sunday for every football game here and the biggest game of the year they told us a $500 engagement party was more important then regulars. We will not be back and we will not refer anybody to this place. They have poor management and nobody there ever seems to know what they're doing. To compensate for their mishap they offered a free medium one topping pizza which I had a coupon for anyways. This place is a joke.

Update:
The owners did call and make it right on our next visit. We are regulars there and the staff is super nice! The food is good and with the coupons they send it's pretty affordable."}
{"text":"I am from out of state.  Our Rosati's is a good bet.  I ordered a $20 small deep dish... should be top notch.  I realized it would take longer...cool.  I got a call about 45 min later from the delivery man.  He says \"ya, I am leaving now.  No one wanted to come out there as it's too far.  (4mi-13 min).  I was happy he gave me an update, but knew that something might be up.  He arrives, very polite and says he \"apologized, when he saw my good tip, man, I had to deliver it\".  Odd to say the least.  I open the box and they had covered the pizza with tinfoil!  Wet. Wet. Wet.  My crunchy deep dish was a wet, slimy mess.  I am sorry but for $20 bucks and a nice tip, I would have expected at least a normal pie.  Not the wet mess I received."}
{"text":"Have reviewed before but only for pizza. We gave 4stars for flavor. Had our first sandwich today and was basically shocked. Ordered Italian sandwich and when i got home was shocked. Sausage on dry bread. That's it. Never again."}
{"text":"Got a groupon & had to use it for dining in the restaurant.  We get delivery from here all the time for their pizza, which is delish!  Dining in, is another story...

Service was awful, waited forever for a drink refill. The thermostat says its 85 in their dining area and it felt hotter than that!  I've noticed the heat before while picking up pizza but when you're sitting in it for an hour, its unacceptable.  Got a chicago dog today, was alright.. a bit cold for the 20 minute wait and drowned in red onion, literally.. they cut a whole red onion just for me.  Husband had \"the peoria cheef\" which was so dry & didn't come with any sauce.

And the little things: 1) had to steal 3 bottles of ketchup from the neighboring tables and we still barely had enough, when I told the waitress she replied with, \"oh I know, they're all empty.. ha ha\" really? If you knew, why wouldn't you get it for us? 2) no music, felt so weird only hearing the rattling of their barely working AC. We will never dine-in again!! 3) there is no decor in the dining area, so that was easy to rate.

Will definitely order pizza delivery but I will never dine in again, even if another groupon comes up.. not worth 1/2 off."}
{"text":"Best place to get deep dish pizza. l'm from Chicago so I'm always searching for a good pizza place. I've been coming here since I was like born. I feel like their thin crust pizza is starting to need major improvement. I eat there at least once a month and it definitely needs work. But their sauce is the best you can find in Nevada. Once you eat Rosati's you'll hopefully never eat Pizza Hut again lol"}
{"text":"There aren't any other \"gourmet\" quick pizza joints in this area, which is why we come back here. The pastas aren't too expensive considering I can make 2-3 meals out of it but they taste kind of cheap, but sometimes that's the taste I'm going for so it's fine. It seems expensive for one pizza, but the pizza is actually super filling. We got the rosatis monster pizza and it had lots of toppings, tastes really good. The crust isn't spectacular, but acceptable. Definitely better gourmet pizza out there...but so long as I live in the area, I'll come back here once in a while but not worth a drive. Service provided is above average."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza was very good. The one thing that didn't make it great was that the dough was a little think and not as much sauce as an authentic Chicago deep dish but the taste was almost there. A little pricey in my opinion. The service was great though!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a crispy, thin crust pizza, this is the place.  Our pizza was one of the best we've had!  The pizza was tasty with
Tomato sauce that was not overpowering.
Previously tried their steak sandwiches which also were great.
Delivery service was prompt and  customer service courteous.
Definitely will order again."}
{"text":"We had the Chicken Fettucine Alfredo delivered on a Saturday evening after driving back from Tucson and it was FANTASTIC! The added sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts really give it a special twist that isn't overwhelming but instead adds just a little zing. My mom and I decided we will try other items on the menu since this was so good - even after being delivered i.e. sitting in a car for a while. The portions are HUGE! We could have easily shared one. Instead, we had dinner on Sunday night. I'm excited to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"First of all they put me on hold for a few minutes which is understandable since they're busy. I ordered a deep dish Chicago style pizza. They delivered it to my house after waiting for an hour. The pizza had absolutely no sauce on it. I had to call and complain to get a new one. They asked to take the pizza back but I refused. I had them bring me a new pizza. It took another hour. It wasn't even that good. Extremely disappointed. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. I should start at the beginning. My wife and I entered the restaurant and it was nearly empty. The host was talking with someone we couldn't see. She looked up and with no expression just waved us to sit anywhere. I thought to myself, not very friendly. We ordered from the same lady that motioned us in and she got slightly more friendly. Then the long wait. They had several more customers arrive. Our order was taken quickly enough and I was relieved we had arrived when we did. Maybe 25/30 minutes later our food arrived. Grilled chicken for me and a hot dog for my wife. Both with fries. My food was good. The fries were hot the way I prefer them. My wife's fries were hot. However, it appears no one had cooked the hotdog. Right, a cold hotdog was served. Amazing. When we mentioned this to the server, no apology and only the comment that they were busy and everyone's order had come in at once. Had she forgotten we were the first to arrive other than maybe four customers at the back?  

Due to the tightness of the center and the trees etc we had never been to this location. We had decided to give it a try as it was close to home. We thought, eureka, maybe we have found another neat place to eat close by. I had even said to my wife these kind of places survive on word of mouth. Yes, word of mouth in this case isn't good. We are not likely to return due to unfriendly staff (possibly the manager), very slow service and uncooked food. By the way we went in at lunch. Most people want to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time at lunch."}
{"text":"When you drive up 18 min before closing and the employees lock the doors and hide. Okay. We'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I pass on this place.  

We had loved Rosati's in Arizona and finally decided to try them here.  I would think they would be close to consistent in their food but I was completely wrong.  First off their delivery time initially stated was 1 hour. That was fine but then 1 1/2 later was when it was finally delivered.  Time is of the essence when I'm hungry.  They failed. 

Once we received our order I noticed they sent pizza dough nuggets instead of the garlic knots I ordered.  Fine. Whatever I was hungry.  Upon opening the bread box, sauce was leaking out of the corner with sauce all over the top of the pizza box.  In the end it didn't matter because they were cold and not good.  We didn't eat them.  

They are consistent with one thing... Spilling sauce all over their delivered items.  The chicken wings had blue cheese dressing all over the container.  Did it make the wings better? No. They were completely overcooked and tough.  Yuck.  

Was the pizza alright? Nope. 3 for 3.  It was cold with hardened cheese.  Crust had no flavor.  

With bad food and delivery wait time, it was clearly disappointing."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, kid friendly and fast service. As a parent with 3 little boys this place hits the spot. Everything tastes home made and fresh. Really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"It's such a bummer I have to give this place a bad review, because their product is great, but the service is awful. Being from Chicago, Rosati's is a nice piece of home. The pizza and sandwiches are great, if you get on time. They quoted me an hour for deliver on one sandwich and fries. It took an hour and 30 minutes for it to get here. I had to call twice on the status and they totally act like they don't care. I'd normally not let this bug me, but every time we order from there they never quite know what's going on. Overall, foods great, service is poor. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"LOVE Rosati's pizza!  Each Rosati's seems to make it a little different. We find this location to taste the best"}
{"text":"Really great calzones and the staff is really nice. A little on the expensive side for pizza but if you save 12 box coupons you get one pizza half off. But the calzones really are delicious"}
{"text":"If you like this place, then you have no idea what real pizza is. Period.  Buddyz down the street makes the CHICAGO failure look like there football team. Not even close. Please read and avoid. This place has dead pizza."}
{"text":"I've ordered and been to this restaurant before and had wonderful pizza and service... however, this time I'm not happy. I ordered chicken wings to be delivered and they looked strange. I've never seen chicken wings that were pink underneath the hot sauce!! Chicken was also rubbery... just didn't seem safe to eat! Upon calling to advise of my complaint-- the manager would only offer a credit on our next visit to the restaurant!! That won't make me go back! I hope I don't see them on dirty dining!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today with a buddy and all i can say is wow. Ordered a pizza and some wings and i can say they did not disappoint.  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was great. Definitely coming back very soon. Keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"If you order takeout from this location, budget an extra hour or two for delivery. We called when it was 30 minutes late and they had just put it in the oven. Rude customer service and no manager on duty. Pretty sure they are all stoned."}
{"text":"Great pizza per the hungry kids I got carry out for.  

The sauce was flavorful and the crust was crisp, not soggy.

Italian beef sandwich we ordered was very good.  The calzone looked awesome (didn't try any).

Long delivery wait on a Wed. afternoon drove me to using carry out.  Carry out was ready in 25 minutes.

 The team at Rosati's was very courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome. Great atmosphere. Great service. Thanks to Charles for a great experience! Will come back next year when we return to AZ."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We ordered 2 pizzas for pickup and they had no record of it when we arrived 30 minutes later. Confirmed on my sister's phone that she called this location. They offered to put the order in at that time and we asked for it to be delivered, thinking that might be faster than going home and coming back. WRONG! Pizza arrived 1 hour 20 minutes later and they didn't even waive the $2 delivery fee after they messed up."}
{"text":"How hard is it to screw up not once but twice
We ordered a deep dish with Italian sausage and Canadian bacon deep dish
we knew it would take time [its 820 pm]  at 915 the waitress brings a complimentary appetizer saying it will be here soon [that was nice]
then the pizza arrives  green peppers, where did the meat go?
She confirmed that she put in the ticket for  Italian sausage and Canadian bacon 
She apologized saying she will rush it, confirmed again our order
shows up 25 minutes later [10 pm] only Canadian bacon.
How do you screw it up twice.  Asked for the manager and said that is it we are leaving.  He \"agreed\" to remove the pizza charge but still charged us $12 for 2 beers, Thank you!
great experience!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently \"discovered\" Rosati's in Ahh-wuh-too-key.  A friend (a former New Yorker no less) ordered us some thin crust, and I was surprised to find good ol' squares instead of slices.  I was even more surprised to find that it's the best Chicago style thin crust I've had in my 6+ years in the valley.  How have I not run across this place sooner?

I wish they had a \"junk\" or \"garbage\" pizza special, but the Classic Sausage will do.  Nice spicy hunks of sausage in almost every bite

Avoid the wings though!  Horrible.  Wings should be deep fried or grilled . . . maybe I got a bad batch, but I think they actually BOILED them?  Is that possible?  Irregardless, they were terrible. 

It's a huge kitchen with a small counter area for takeout, so don't plan on eating there.  It's in the strip mall with CK's . . . I wonder if CK's would let us bring in Rosati's pizza while we drink and watch the games . . . ?  Wings aside, it's my new Go To for pizza"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place prior to about a month ago, and I was incredibly pleased after ordering a deep dish Chicago style pizza for my family! The people who work there are very helpful and sweet! After that I've had the fries and a super supreme pizza and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a good rating, but a few things are bothering me.

First off, this place is only a storefront.  Meaning, you can't dine in here.  It's like one of those Pizza Hut delivery only locations, except there aren't even any tables.  So you either have to carry out or get it delivered.  Meh.

The first time, I tried the \"Rosati's Famous Ribs.\"  They were decent, but far from the best I've tasted.  They're of the St. Louis variety; thick and meaty, but soft and easy to consume.  The sauce was very strong and overpowering.  A much better alternative is Ellis Island BBQ, if you're just going for the ribs, otherwise I'd just settle for half a rack and something else.

Next, I tried the pizza.  The lady I ordered from was very unclear over the phone.  I wanted to try the Rosati's Pan Pizza (the thick crust; like the Chicago style, but without all those extra gross tomatoes on top).  There was a miscommunication and I ended up with the double dough crust (which is the thin crust, doubled up with more crust).  I was disappointed by the mistake, but the pizza was still good (the crust was merely okay).  I also had the BBQ wings, which were very good.

All in all, it's a 4 star rating for the food, but a mediocre 3 for the presentation and customer service."}
{"text":"Madison is a small city. Madison is a small city.  Madison is a small city.   You see, I have to keep telling myself that because despite what the news and the people of Madison say, think, and want....MADISON IS A SMALL CITY!

Why is that important in a Yelp review?   Well, with it being a small city...there are many things we cannot get.  A good authentic Philly cheesesteak (not the crappy Wisconsin roast beef version), a decent soup place, good Chinese food, alligator, good seafood, a Taco Bell that serves alcohol, and deep dish Chicago pizza....wait what?

I have known about Rosati's for years and also knew they had deep dish Chicago pizza and other Chicago favorites.  Why only try them recently?   Well, I live in Fitchburg so it is not an easy take-out of delivery location for me and....well I was dumb and did not realize they had a seating area.  yes, I thought it was only take-out and delivery.   Anyway, after a picture on Yelp cleared that up it was time to treat the family on a night I was craving it.

So....lets go one item at a time as I have been back a few times in the last few months.  

DEEP DISH PIZZA:  Is the the best?   No.   Many places in Chicago have that on lock but for Madison.....yes.  Ok, they are the only player in town but it was a good cheesy and yummy Chicago deep dish pizza.

THIN CRUST PIZZA:   Well I have kids and a wife.  None of them eat deep dish with me so I always have to get a think crust as well.   Eh....it is good but I have had better in Madison.

ITALIAN BEEF:  What?  Where did this come from?   Yes you cannot get a good Italian beef in Madison either.   Same opinion as the Philly cheesesteak. Well, look no longer because the Italian beef at Rosati's awesome.  Dipped, great beef, add some cheese, and giardiniera....hmmm.....yum!

Oh....dont get the dough nuggets.  They are not very good.

So....I like Rosati's a lot and the vast Chicago menu is great for a person like me who loves food in Chicago.  My advice to Wisconsin...Stop calling your roast beef sandwiches an Italian beef of Philly Cheesesteak....you just disappoint people!"}
{"text":"This is my first Eek Methinks. We were looking for a quiet place to have dinner and we thought Rosati's would be good. We had coupon that did not honor because it was the wrong location. Second the service was poor. I had to fill our own drinks. Third while i was watching a movie the waitress changed the channel with asking me if i was watching, Who does that? How rude? Finally they got our order wrong. I think it is safe to say I am never going back."}
{"text":"I love their service and their food! Great mountain views outside and the atmosphere is great for families!"}
{"text":"Finally open again under new ownership!!! These new guys are fantastic and the pizza is amazing.  They are from Chicago so the pizza is original. The sausage is very fresh, mushrooms are fresh and their service is unbeatable!  Glad to see it's finally doing well."}
{"text":"Icky! What happened Rosattis? The Alfredo tasted off like they used rancid cheese and you charged me $6 for 10 tiny fried mushrooms?  And a minor offense but I asked for ranch and you gave me Italian ? Any other dressing and I would have suffered but I hate Italian . So I ended up not  eating that tiny salad you craved me $8 for. Yeah I'm not paying for over priced stale food again."}
{"text":"I am a severe pizza-holic.  This pizza is THE BEST that I have found, yet, anywhere in the valley.  My only regret is that I didn't find them sooner!  I love the sauce they put on the pizza, the generous proportions, and the excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to this and many other rosatis pizza locations, and even though the pizza is delicious, I can't say I think it's worth the price. The quality and taste very much has a traditional homemade vibe which I love! Although, there are other pizza places offering the same quality pizza for less. I love the pizza, but unfortunately probably won't return very often for this reason."}
{"text":"I took my family here for pizza. When we got there we got our seat right away. That was the best part of our night. The lady came over for our drink order. I asked if they could make a scorpion drink and she look at me I don't know what this is so I said ok just a diet Coke. My husband order water and my son a root beer.
It took a while to get our drinks. After she gave us our drinks sue then went to another table,and talk with them for a while. I heard the waitress say blow mommy a kiss from the other table so that's when I found out that they were family.  It didn't bother me at first. When she walk by us I said excuse me. And she kept walking. She was gone for a minute and she walked by us again and gave a beer to the other table. Again she was there for a while and when she walked by us again and my husband said excuse me three times. And she kept walking. The table behind me told her hey they want your help. Then she turned around and asked yes with I dirty look on her face. We asked for a refill on the water and root beer and I ask for a margarita. I wasn't asked what flavor I wanted. All I get was a eye roll. It took 12 minutes for the drinks. I know because this time I timed it. After we had our pizza sue asked if we need anything else from. I said yes I have a coupon for a tiramisu. Again she rolled her eyes and left. 15 minutes later I got it. I ate it and when she handed us the bill I asked to speak to the manager. My husband said no have just let it go. When the manager came over I said oh I'm sorry I changed my mind.i paid the bill with cash and didn't leave a tip. We left and went to the car and the next thing I know this waitress came running out yelling you didn't leave a tip. So there was a yelling match between me and this lady in the parking lot. We got in our car and left. So the next day I called to talk to the owner and boy oh boy. She go in the phone I went to tell her what happened and the jext thing I know she stopped me in mid sentence. She said how dare you not leave a tip. A tip is a must  here because this is a full restaurant. I told her u tip to how well the staff is. The better they are the more money they get. Then the owner said well you didn't tip her and I laughed and I said well she sucked. Then she told me if I don't tip in any kind of tip I should go to McDonald's.. I told her will my check came to 42.77 and the cash I gave you was 42.78 so you need to do the math and that is what yet customer service was worth and hung up the phone"}
{"text":"We've been to several Rosati's Pizza Parlors in the Tempe/Chandler area, always takeout. After thirty visits we finally dined at the Ray Road location. It had a cute bar, attractive waitresses, brick walls, kind of a pseudo Chicago feel in the desert. It appeared a family style restaurant, just that we expected. They offered several draft beers, but only lite beer in 1/2 Pitchers, why? Next, the waitress dropped a heavy pizza stand on my foot in passing, \"Sorry\" was mentioned. Any other place, a complementary beer was in order. Nope, not here!  There was a large group of 12 -- half women, half men, late forties, early fifties, Caucasian, at two tables in the cozy dining room. Evidently, the entire crew knew them, kind words were said and hugs with servers and management went on the entire time we were there. We assumed the diners were the franchise or family owners. As time past, hey were literally screaming at each other in delight, as the gaggle grew louder than any sport's bar I've ever visited for Super Bowl at the beach, with motorcycles out front. This din grew so loud, every table around us, the other family occupants, some with small children, were leaving, putting their pizzas in ever growing larger and larger boxes. Like idiots, we stayed. Pizza finally arrived. We asked for well done, nearly burnt dough, please. Bottom of pizza dough was just north of white raw. I considered having waitress to re-enter pie in oven, but had visions of large \"loogies\" added after baking. I immediately grabbed the pepper flake dispenser -- the entire contents, with chromed tin lid included, landed upon the pie. Same waitress who dropped the pizza stand, removed the affected slices and commented, \"Kids like to do this, sorry!\" But we're out a fourth of our pizza. My 30 year old son then went to the manager, (assist.?), complaining about the noise and swear words. He was asked \"Haven't you ever dined here? We're a fun establishment.\" \"No.\", my son answered. \"This is who we are...\" was mentioned. As we left, my wife scolded the manager, \"This was the worst service I think I've ever had.\" \"Sorry\", again, was enthusiastically mentioned. My wife said \"Like hell, you're sorry...\"  We've had our last pizza at Rosati's."}
{"text":"I just ordered from this Rosati's for the first time in quite awhile.  

Previously I had stopped ordering as every time I did the order was screwed up.  Not a little off or late, but waaaaaay off and late on several consecutive instances.

Something has changed.  

The gentleman taking the order was efficient and coherent.

The order arrived faster than expected and to my surprise was 100% accurate.

All went well rather than the parade of failure and ineptitude I had seen for the last year and change.

So Great Job Rosati's Crew.   

Keep executing on the basics.

Don't get cocky."}
{"text":"Quiet dinner for a Saturday night in Vegas. But then again, it's away from the strip. great spaghetti marinara and pizza. Sometimes the best food is Vegas is off the strip! Check them out!"}
{"text":"What happend?   We would order from here even when our Chicago friends and family came to visit.  Now it is a last resort because there are not many late delivery places in Gilbert.  They have messed up the last three orders and the quality went way down.  Management or staff needs to start paying attention.  Its giving a bad name for Chicago pizza.   Good luck."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online yesterday. Was quoted a time of 30 minutes.  When 30 minutes passed we checked in and were told it would be an additional 30 minutes due to high volume.  After an hour and 15 minutes passed we called and spoke to a young man who clearly doesn't care about customers. He informed us or would be another 45 minutes due to high volume.  We said go ahead and cancel the order,  we literally live across the street, I could've walked over,  placed my order and carried home in less time.  He responded with fine and hung up.  We called back and asked how was he planing to credit our card back when he gathered no intimation. First he said he knew which one to credit because he could tell by our location which one we were,  then he told us because we placed the order online they could not credit the account.  We are so disappointed, this used to be one of our favorite spots. Not only will we NEVER go to Rosati's again,  we well make sure to tell all of our friends and family to avoid them as well. I hope the owners or franchisees or corporate (whomever is actually in charge) takes note of the way their brand was represented on Saturday night."}
{"text":"New to AZ/Mesa.

Could not drive 2 nights back, found Rosati's @Mesa/Ellsworth.  Ordered delivered 12\" or so pizza, pepperoni, sausage, 'shrooms, very well done.

It was great.  As good or better than anything I could get in The OC.

So was the \"dinner salad.\"

Calling them right now for some more delivery meals.

Can't wait to visit the brick and mortar."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was looking for teramisu and found it was so good.. and I was able to get my picky little eater some spaghetti and h loved it."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza with a smile!!!!!
Omg...we had a long week and wanted nothing more than some hot fresh pizza. Rosati's delivered and although the poor guy encountered tons of traffic and an accident on the way he was pleasant. He called as soon as he got here, he apologized for the delays and was so sweet and kind. Wish I got his name!"}
{"text":"We usually have a great experience ordering from Rosati's, but our order last night was awful. We ordered an 18\" with four toppings, along with an order of mozzarella sticks. The pizza appeared to be missing two of the ingredients and it definitely didn't taste like they were there, the pizza was smushed to one side of the box, and the entire order was cold....not luke warm, but actually cold. Overall, it was really disappointing and given how pricey they are, we were shocked at the poor quality."}
{"text":"All I ordered was a small chicago style crust pizza. That is what this review is about. The place was very clean. I had time to look because it takes between 35-40 minutes to make and cook one of these crusts. There are 2 TVs, both on sports channels. Parking and access is easy off 40th Street or Bell Rd. The place is actually North of Bell Rd on 40th St. next to Walgreen's. It's across the street from the high school.

There were 3 empty tip jars on the counter and a place to tip on the receipt, but I only tip if there is wait service at the table, but if I have to walk to get a refill of my drink and walk to the counter to ask for a to-go box, that is not waiter service, and therefore no tipping. Sorry. Tipping here would be like tipping at burger king.

There is no nutrition information online or at the store, so if you are on a diet like I am, then I would assume the worst possible scenario.

Food quality was passing. It's a big cut above school cafeteria food, perhaps better than the cheap pizza chains like Domino's. But as a former Chicago resident and still a pizza snob, it's in the lower levels of compatibility with true Chicago Style. (In my opinion the standard for \"Chicago style\" is from Pizzaria Uno or Due)

I lived in/near Chicago in the 1960s-70s and never heard of this chain. My brother has lived there all his life and told me he has been there and most of the people he knows would rate the chain a 4 on the 10 scale. So this place is like the Ponderosa of pizza chains. Somewhere above fast food but significantly below places like Pizzaria Uno or Malnati's.

Bad sign: I arrived there at 12:15pm and there was only one other person in the store, during the lunch rush hour. They may do a really good delivery business with the hospital across the street.

It cost me $21.06 for a small drink and one small pizza.

Update: subsequent visits to this mall going to other stores, their parking lot is usually empty at lunch time - not a good sign."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Rosati's you are missing out! When I came here I had a meatball sub and it was the best I've had thus far. The meatballs were so tender and the bread was perfect, not too crisp or too soft to leave you with a soggy mess!

I finally brought my boyfriend here and he loved it! Call in your order ahead of time so it will be ready by the time you come or you'll have to wait 10-15 minutes. There are only counters inside and if you can bear the heat by now there are tables outside. It's not a sit down and eat place. If you're looking for authentic Italian give Rosati's a try!"}
{"text":"Just went to Rosati's for an Italian beef. Huge sandwich, lots of meat big soft bun delicious au jus. Had a cannolli. Authentic. Best cannolli I've had in Mesa. Crunchy she'll and not too sweet"}
{"text":"Due to censorship I am writing another update! 

BASED ON MY LAST FEW EXPERIENCES AT THIS LOCATION ------------- THE HIGH STANDARDS THAT I ENJOYED WHEN I FIRST ATE HERE ARE NOT THERE ANYMORE -------- PIZZA WAS DRY, SALTY AND DULL!! 

Since my last visit I checked current inspection results - see for yourself as I did! A city/state health inspection is not \"hearsay\" - Unfortunately, this location was awarded a \"D\" and had several violations - this is fact and a matter of county record. Hopefully they act on this inspection and find a way to bring there standards back up to the high level they once were.

Until then, I will be taking my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I love Rosati's Pizza and this location is great.  Nice ownership and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from this branch during counselor trip to the city. Planned on ordering from another chain but the hotel recommended this restaurant instead. Big mistake!!! Placed order at 8:22 and called THREE times for updates - 9 pm, 9:30 pm and 10:00 pm. Each time, was told that pizza was en route...with arrival times increasing each time I called. Pizza finally arrived at 10:10 (it was too late to consider other options by then) and quality was, at best, just edible. Not worth the grief, price or wait. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"The owner is very rude. I had an entertainment book coupon that had a valid date. He refused to honor it and then told me that he will just throw the pizza away unless I paid full price."}
{"text":"We love the pizza here, but am still waiting on an order that was made around 6 p.m.  It's now 8 p.m., and it's still not here.  My husband called to complain and they are taking 50 percent off the order which is appreciated.  It's Thursday evening and we ordered 2 pizzas and a salad.  Not sure what is taking so long."}
{"text":"After giving this place 2 more chances to see if things would improve which they have not, I now go elsewhere for Chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"I've been buying pizza here for well over a couple of years. I loved it. Unfortunately they just moved to a new location over Eastern and closed the Wigwam store. I asked the guys at Wigwam if it would be the same and they said yes but that they were opening a dining room too. I order the first pizza there and it was significantly different than the one at Wigwam. Visited the store and didn't recognized anyone working there. Order a second time over the phone and I was reassured that it was the same \"owner\". Pizza arrived and just by picking it up I could tell the difference. Their Chicago deep dish is at least 30% lighter than the ones I used to get at Wigwam. That means less crust, less cheese, less everything. The pizza is not bad but I'm disappointed at the blatant change in their quality while there's been no change on the prices. While I still enjoy it, it is definitely not worth it to spend $25 on a pizza here. That's the problem with franchises....sure same owner, but the product is not the same at all. Shame on them for affording the cost of opening a dining room by cutting down the pizza materials for loyal customers. I'll make my own from now on or shop somewhere else."}
{"text":"We went here because we have a buy 1 get one pizza free from the Entertainment book.  They informed us we could not use the coupon, even though it said their address on it.  We went ahead and ordered there. We got a large sausage and pepperoni pizza. First impression was the large was small. It was thin crust, which was not too bad. They do not put very much sauce on the pizza and I love sauce so I was disappointed.  Also, each square of pizza had 1 piece of pepperoni and 1 ball of sausage. I prefer my sausage in little ground up pieces and these were the size of mini meatballs, so I ended up taking off the sausage. I probably wouldn't go here again especially since 1 pizza was over 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Very good Chicago Deep Dish! Our server Reina was prompt and very friendly. She stayed on top of our drinks which is not easy to do with my hubby.  We ordered a kids cheese pizza and it was huge! I think it's basically an 8\" or 10\" for $6.99. The hubby and I wanted to try their famous Chicago deep dish and he was able to order his half the way he wanted as well as mine the way I wanted. We ordered a Caesar Salad and split it before our pizza came out. The dressing was on the side so we mixed it up in the bowl. The dressing was on point! Deep dish pizza always takes time to cook of course so Reina checked in on us often. The pizza came out and it was super delish! I like it much more than BJ's Deep Dish Pizza. Rosati's tastes more traditional in our opinion. For dessert we ordered the cannolis which come with pistachio powder on the ends. Extremely tasty!  I love cannolis and theirs are perfection   The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"I love them, the pizza reminds me of home (Chicago). My regular order is the Monster thin crust...yummo! I like that it is cut Chicago style (squares). The crust is cracker crispy."}
{"text":"Ordered a thin crust cheese pizza with definitely not thin crust. order took over an hour for delivery and when I called to check on the status the person who answered the phone was very rude. Will not order from here again"}
{"text":"Tried their deep dish pizza. Was forgettable. The crust was cooked, but the sauce was still cold. It was very filling as a deep dish pizza should be, but did not satisfy. They have two tables inside and 2 tables outside. It's really just a takeout and delivery place. Won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"This is the closest that we displaced Chicago natives can get to real Chicago Deep Dish. Little tip, always go to this location. It's near my work, so most of the time I go here, but I was at the one on Power road twice and twice the sides of the pizza collapsed (a sign that they don't know how to construct the pizza) and the breaded mushrooms were too dark on the outside and raw on the inside. There is nothing quite as lovely as raw batter surrounding your mushrooms. 
I also went to the one in Chandler once, the pizza was ok, but the staff wasn't very friendly. I had my 3 yr old grandson with me and when he smiled at a staff member, the guy looked at him like he had three heads. I'm not saying gush all over the kid, but damn a smile wouldn't hurt. 

I do recommend that you only get the pizza though. I tried a chicken sandwich once and it was awful."}
{"text":"Was very excited that they were open Easter! We ordered delivery and They delivered early and the food was nice and warm upon arrival! Loved the deep dish and double dough. All of it super yummy. The antipasto was nice and fresh. It was nice that the dressing was packaged on the side. Overall great experience with Rosati's delivery. Will definitely order again and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Just recently moved near this Rosati's location. I have been ordering Rosati's for a few years now. I would say hands down the service at this location is the best I have experienced. The owner of the location made a great effort to have an impersonal conversation with me while I waited for my pizza. The pizza come out and was great. I really enjoyed the service and for sure will be sending my friends here. Also the D.C. Ranch location is great too, it has a full bar and great service as well!"}
{"text":"My name is Sara and I am a Rosati's addict! This location does get quite busy on the weekends but it's always worth the wait! They have several booths and tables,bar stools,soda fountain and TVs. They have a cool Chicago vibe going and great staff! The food here is absolutely amazing! I am a thin crust lover and I haven't found a better crust in my life! I have driven 40min. Just to get this pizza! I would highly recommend trying this place,you won't eat any other pizza again.TIP I recently found out also they have a point system and I've been getting discounts all the time! Cool,thank you. It makes me eat here more."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PLACE. I still hate it to this day! I ordered pizza and additional items, but only the pizza was delivered, When I called to report what happened, someone stated that they would come back to my house. They never came!!! I went the next day to complain and the ignorant, rude manager had an attitude problem. I became upset and she threatened to call the police if I didn't leave the premises ( I had my 2 year-old daughter with me,,, Really!!!) The police actually came... Anyway, I reported them to BBB. The manager's explanation of her side of the story was full of grammatically incorrect sentences. What a joke! I was compensated for my aggravation, but the damage was done."}
{"text":"I used to like going here, but lately it just seems...I dunno, to be going downhill. The food just...doesn't taste as good as it used to. I'm not sure what has changed, since they claim nothing has, but...yea. The last several times I've met people here its just been kind of...blah.

I think I need to start avoiding this place if things don't shape up. Hopefully they do, because it used to be delicious, but something is wrong here now."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular customer - not anymore. I'm from Chicago and Rosatis has become here what it is there - a chain just a link or two above pizza hut or dominos! Sometimes the pizza was great but, overall far too many problems (undercooked/skimped on cheese/one time forgot to put sausage in pizza - just dropped it on top and ran it thru again...came out dry and all the sausage just rolled off!) Order at thunderbird/ 57th & Union or bell rd - much much better at those locations - I think they just gave up here!!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Chicago I've acquired a certain taste for pizza unfortunately it was not till I moved away from home that I found out All Pizza Are Not Created Equal. Ever since then I have quest for that Chicago home style pizza taste. And I think I've finally found it. Rosati's Pizza has shot out of heaven and finally quenched my taste bugs. Kudos to you. The thin crust sausage and pepperoni did it for me the best hands down. Deep dish was ok not like home. Pan toss have yet to try and I'm too satisfied with my thin rust to change. God Bless Rosati's Pizza for saving the day!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here nearly 65 times it's close super fast delivery coupons etc.. the pizza is good the deep dish is very good and heavy I like the raviolis and the marinara is great the calzones are the best because they don't use ricotta which I cannot stand.  This isn't the kind of place you order fries and a burger those things aren't the greatest but they do have some great salads and they are always fast"}
{"text":"Sooo, this place is \"famous \" for their thincrust pizza. There is a Rosati's closer to us than this one on Ellsworth- but they had more reviews... Boo. This Rosati's was ok. We made it long before the dinner rush  (4pm) and there was no one in the restaurant. The bartender was our server  and she was really nice. We asked her opinion, &she suggested the thincrusted pizza-as that is what they are known for. We ordered that plus a DeepDish w/added topping. We waited 40 minutes, asked the server what was up with our order, and she calmly explained that the deep dish takes LONG, extra LONGER with addl toppings. So i asked Where is the thincrust, then? She replied, we make it so the orders come out same time. Uugh, im starving by now! Haha, the pizzas come out finally, the FAMOUS thincrust is So-so, amd the deepdish is great... EXCEPT that 2 of the 3 people dining experienced DIGESTIVE ISSUES all that evening. Sorry, but we WILL NOT BE EATING ROSATI'S AGAIN. Bleech!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Waited a hour to receive a banged up $20 pizza. Called to inform rosatis of the problem and was interrogated and doubted by the manager and driver. I was told I had to wait for them to come pick up the pizza then bring me another? No thanks come pick it up and keep it! Papa murphys it is for Friday nights!"}
{"text":"Every meal we order here is very flavorful and portions are generous. There are a few small tables for dining in but really it is a carry out or they do deliver. Call ahead and most meals are ready in 20\". I have their # in my cell as frequently when I am in the nearby Lowe's or Home Depot I find myself hungry and call to place an order. Pizza, entrees, and sides are all very good. We have never once been disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm very funny about pizza and I've been in Vegas for nine years from the Midwest and I think Rosati's has the best pizza in town! Lee was my server and she was super nice! I'll be visiting Rosati's again very soon.   

I only wish they had more specials or a happy hour or something."}
{"text":"We love this place, but tonight the waitress sucks. Screwed up our order. We Had a coupon for a free cheese pizza. Which we didn't get cuz she thought she would comp our bill for the difference. She should of asked us! Took forever for our refills. Try to tell us that my daughter margarita pizza came with garlic, when I ordered on my pizza which I didn't get."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Rosatis a few times and their pizza is very good. Delivery however needs work.  Order to delivery was 1.5 hours and the pizza was lukewarm by the time we received it. We were famished. Why is good pizza and delivery so hard to get in Vegas?"}
{"text":"I like Rosati's OK for delivery, because it's nice to have a place that will deliver stuff like fried chicken and fries.  I don't recommend eating in, though. Every time I've been there, they've been understaffed and slow. The employees are trying, but there aren't enough of them."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place and it took 90 minutes to deliver a single topping large pizza.  When it got here it was cold.  Poor service - no thanks."}
{"text":"This location is far better than any other location in Arizona, everything is fresh and made for your expectations, the people are always friendly and never mean, any problem that you have they will fix it with no questions asked, the pizza was outstanding and the meatball parm was excellent, (you should try it on garlic bread, the owner referred it to me) I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering takeout from the Cheyenne location since we moved to Vegas in 2013. Great pizza, great wings!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great wings, great service and I'm excited to try more things they have to offer. I always pick up or have it delivered and they are very punctual, no waiting for your food. By far the best wings I've ever had"}
{"text":"LOVE there sausage pizza. Wish others would use the same size sausage as Rosati's"}
{"text":"I used a Groupon yesterday for the 16\" Chicago style.  Definitely delicious.  However, the bottom crust was wet - cooked through but too much liquid in the ingredients.  We added sausage, mushrooms, green pepper, onion, and giardinera.  As others have said, it's difficult finding the sausage and mushrooms, but the flavor was there.  Service was fine.  Not a dine-in location."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. I got the Cheef Italian beef sandwich. This thing had a ton of beef in it. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I have had Rosati's a number of times. Their thin crust pizza is usually fantastic!  Our last two interactions have been absolutely horrible!  Today I called in and ordered an 18 inch combo and 24 wings: half BBQ and half habenero.   When I showed up at 6:15 (an hour after ordering) Macayla took my payment and then started looking for my order. It wasn't there. She went around back where I could still here her and see her through a gap in the coolers and asked where my order was.  They then discovered they had forgotten to make it completely. She came back up and said 'it will just be a couple minutes and then ran in back. When she came back a couple minutes later I asked her how it was coming. She again said it would be just a couple minutes. I told her I had heard the conversation she had earlier in the back and told her to tell me the truth and asked if they forgot to make my order. She looked shocked I had called her out but admitted that's what happened. I asked her why she had told me it would be just a couple minutes when it would be much longer. She said it only takes 7 minutes to make a pizza so it would be just a couple minutes. When I asked to speak to a manger she said she was the manager. I asked for the general managers name and number and she gave me his name. She then said none of it was her fault because someone quit earlier today. 
15 minutes later they brought out my food. I should have checked the wings in the bag but didn't until I got home. 
I only received 6 of each flavor wings ( I ordered 24 and received 12 total) and the pizza was very underdone: soggy and doughy. There was probably half a pound of corn meal between the crust and the box and it was virtually inedible. 
The wings were good but nobody could eat the pizza. 
Disappointing at best. Pics of the pizza will be posted."}
{"text":"Amazing portion sizes! Doesn't smell like smoke. The Tuesday special on beer and wings is a good deal!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not what I expected, flavors are overwhelming... wings on the other hand are good, I'd think twice before ordering again..!!"}
{"text":"Just got a large thin pizza, got extra sauce and green pepper and sausage. We like a decent amount of sauce. Pizza taste was great. The sauce is very flavorful. Me and da wife highly recommend it. 

Tip: If they say 30-40 mins, plan on the 40 min frame. Quality pizza takes time unlike the chains."}
{"text":"Not as bad as people say.... pretty good pizza and their sauce is actually pretty delicious but if I had to pick Grimaldi is the way to go and near by....if delivery Rosati's my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Rosatis Pizza is delicious... however, they always forget something and a girl who answers the phone isn't good business. They said they would re-deliver something that they forgot (which we paid for) and it never happened. You can have good food, but if your service isn't good, you will not succeed in the long run."}
{"text":"I have been ordering rosatis pizza for over 25 years! The pizza is great, the drivers are fantastic, but the manager and the phone people are rude, and completely incompetent! Sorry to say but today was my last order, I've had enough"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this facility since they opened. While the pizza is great, the customer service is not. There was an incident in which my pizza was over cooked. I called to inform them and spoke with the owner, \"Dad.\" After speaking with him, he offered to replace my pizza on a future occasion. I went in today to redeem the comped pizza. This time \"the son,\" James was working. I informed him of my previous experience and conversation with his father. He proceeded to ring up my order and tell me because prices went up that I was to pay the difference of $5.50. After arguing with him for 5 minutes asking why I was responsible for paying anything if the pizza was \"comped\" and offering to wait to discuss it with his father, James, with a sarcastic attitude, finally agreed to remake the pizza at no additional cost. On top of it, he provided a smaller pizza than I originally ordered. I'm very disappointed with how the situation was handled, his lack of customer service and inability to professionally turn a negative experience into a positive one. James, did his best to ensure I do not be return to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!!! This location is different than some of the others. First, it's not just carry out. This is a family restaurant with a (small) bar. Second, they are the original valley owners and they care! I have only been disappointed here once, and they went out of their way to make things right."}
{"text":"Five dollar special is probably one of the best lunch deals around. Seems to be high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This place was initially \"the bomb\". Great pizza and salad, both sit down and take out. Slowly things changed. Not sure in new owners or what. The restaurant side closed and they now only do take out. Easily 60 % of the time they got our order wrong or the pizza was not done correctly. Monster salad is prepared differently EVERY time we order. Very sad as it once was so good."}
{"text":"Love this rosatis location and order at least once a month. We get the cheef and brushetta and fried pickles and combos etc lol we've never really had their pizza but that's not why we go there. Sandwiches are always piping hot and amazing!! I live for their brushetta lol it's soooo good I could eat it everyday! Always helpful and nice staff as well. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I don't know why the low rating. I love this pizza. I've lived all over the country and this is some sort f the best ever. We always get the monster. Awesome."}
{"text":"Lady on the phone said we are out of the delivery range even it was under 4 miles and I was referred to them by another rosatis. Worst service not recommended."}
{"text":"Just had the pizza for the first time since the new owners took over and it's sooooo much better.  Pizza was fresh and delicious.  We had a deep dish, a thin crust and a gluten free and everyone loved it.  Salads are great for sharing and kids loved the chicken fingers and fries.  Their homemade dressings were the best I've had in Vegas.  They should sell the ranch by the bottle because it's so good.  Forget any other place this is the best in town."}
{"text":"Great Chicago pizza, now available in champaign.  Thin and thick crust are outstanding."}
{"text":"Best place to get the closest thing to Chicago style pizza. Screw pizza hut and all those other places. This is the pizza to eat."}
{"text":"I don't like to write bad reviews either but this location needs a heads up. 

Tonite I used a http://restuarant.com coupon for this Scottsdale location on Hayden.  Had I read these reviews, in advance, I would have tossed the $4 I spent on the coupon and just go to Safeway and buy a pizza and it will be much better.  My husband said that the food is a 4 on 1-10 scale. I thought worse. 
I have eaten at Rosati's for many years, from the location on Shea/Scottsdale and heard that there were franchises but I did not know how bad they could be! They use the exact same logo on the pizza box and menu as the original.

First- the crust...it's like a giant round water cracker.  I knew right then that it wasn't square and it wasn't going to be good. The pizza had no flavor what so ever!

Second- the sauce, where the heck is it? A dry pizza--yuk.

Third- breaded mushrooms--I thought that the frozen boxed version had gotten better since the 80's but it hasn't.

Forth- salad, dry, a separate package of cesar (glue like) dressing. If this place has dine in for dinner, don't serve like a 7-11. 

Fifth- the tiramasu had no flavor and was wet. They were out of cannolis. The cheesecake tasted like paste and there was no topping. 

On the positive side, the woman who was the manager was very nice and seemed concerned when I asked for more pizza sauce. There was enough cheese but I can buy and eat cheap cheese on crackers for a buck and a half. 

The owner would have better luck opening a taco bell or dunkin donuts. My husband and I come from family owned business and we don't think that he/she would not even succeed with that. If you can't please your customers then don't expect to come back or bring their friends."}
{"text":"I agree with others that the service here is lackluster(hence, the 2-star reduction), but the food is so freakin' tasty. My husband and I are pretty much sampling the entire menu, as they are one of the only restaurants that delivers in the area. The thin crust pizzas are great, as long as you do pick-up so it's fresh. The double dough are delicious as well, but nothing could top the stuffed pizza (*wiping away drool). At six months pregnant, this is the craving of all cravings. We did not care for the sausage (way too chewy and gristle-tastic)at this location, and typically stick to the good 'ol cheese and/or pepperoni and we are good to go. The sandwiches are to die for, especially the cheef. Pasta is pretty good and I often order the cheese ravioli. Lasagna is too cheesy, even for this cheese lover and has no meat to speak of...which is typically a prime component of good lasagna. Today, we are trying the baked mostaccoli. I will keep you posted.  Avoid the garlic bread, as it always tastes hard and stale(after probably 10 times of trying it when it comes with salad or pasta, it remains stale each time).  The chicken wings are surprisingly good, especially the new sweet chili sauce. Rarely do hubby and I find a sauce we can agree upon. 

Aside from the sauce, we also both agree that the service here is quite rude. Admittedly, the service was poor when we lived in another area of Chandler with a different Rosatis as well. They hire young girls with attitude problems for the phones and they often get orders wrong. When I called today, the girl working the counter put me on hold without even a \"hello\" or \"hold, please.\"  She came back to the line and continued to ask me my phone number. I began to read it numerous times, each time being interrupted with, \"Area code?\" I once again told her my number, starting with my area code (every time) and she proclaimed, \"Ugh. That's what I was asking for...\" (UGH. That's what I gave you, rude girl). This attitude has been present numerous times at this location before, unfortunately. The delivery is hit or miss with remembering all items and being on time. When it is on time and fresh, YUM!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good.  It's the first time I've ever had Chicago-style pizza.  I ordered it on a whim this past Saturday night because I always wanted to try it.  I ordered a 10-inch pizza with pepperoni.  It's actually quite a bit of food - it would serve 2-3 people pretty easily.  

I phoned in my order and then headed over to pick it up.  If you opt to do the same, a deep dish pizza takes about 25-30 mins to make so plan accordingly.  I got there early and had a beer at the bar.  Bartender was very friendly and service was generally pretty good.

Verdict:  Definitely worth trying.  I'll get food from here again."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Whenever we want pizza, this is the place we want to get it from, even if fast food pizza is cheaper. Great Chicago style pizza, in the opinion of this former Chicago native."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE customer service. The young lady at the counter would not allow me to order without giving a phone number. Then she did not know what mostaccioli is (or how to pronounce it). She gave me the order to take out although I told her it was to dine in -- then gave me a dirty look when I mentioned it. She did not offer me a receipt until I asked for one. The chicken parm was okay, the pasta watery and lousy. Avoid this location!"}
{"text":"My 4 year old DESTROYED some deep dish with pepperoni. Fast delivery and friendly driver. GET THE FRIED MUSHROOMS!!!"}
{"text":"As of April 22, 2014 this location is closed.

Seems fitting,  as over the last couple years the quality had taken a turn for the worse, and never recovered.

I live pretty close to this location, and initially I was hesitant about their menu pricing. My first order from them was a calzone (done \"Frank's Way\") and an order of fried zucchini. When the total came to over $20, and I finally tasted it, I rationalized that this was as good as it would get for my area and having to rely on what was near or could be delivered.

The last couple years have been less of a roller coaster, and more of a bungie-dive into mediocrity. Don't get me wrong, the service was always great, the people always friendly! The food, though, just never lived up to it being presented as \"truly fresh\" thereby more money. With this part of Tempe and Scottsdale cluttered with lousy pizza places, the one thing that should never set you apart is highest price unless the next sentence has \"but worth it\".

I never found my money to be well-spent there. I did always feel like I was valued as a customer, however, and in a weird way I'm sad to see them go."}
{"text":"If you tell someone 20 min for food to be ready there is no reason it should take an hour for it to be ready. Some people have kids to feed and they can't be wasting an hour sitting in your lobby listening to your workers talk about their eyebrows needing to get done. I am a manager where I work and if I ever caught my crew on their phone and talking in front of an unhappy customer they would be sent home for the night seems how they don't want to be there as it is. As I made it clear I was unhappy did I see the manager... No... Only the young girls taking the orders who have no clue what customer service is. It takes more then hiring an employee to make them valuable. This establishment needs training across the board."}
{"text":"great food, but spend as little time inside as possible customer service is poor, and I wish when you said open at 11, that when i call at noon i don't get a machine. 3 stars the food is worth it, but make sure your patience runs high."}
{"text":"The new management and owner is outstanding and their delivery service is fantastic! We eat here at least once a week and are thrilled with the service, fast delivery, and Great Food! The new decor and service inside the restaurant are excellent too! I highly recommend it to anyone in the Cave Creek, North Scottsdale, and Desert Ridge area!"}
{"text":"Finally took a friend's advice and gave Rosati's a try. At this location there no dine in available and it's the first thing you notice. Has a very empty feel to it so i started second guessing my decision to eat here. 

Ordered a Diced Grilled Chicken and Bacon Calzone and was told it'll take 15 minutes, it sure did 15 minutes so i knew it was gonna be fresh.

When i opened the box to look at it i was shocked at what lay waiting for me...This huge half moon shaped golden brown dough thing with baked cheese and spices on the top, a NICELY sized portion of red sauce for dipping and eating instruments. the smell was amazing as well

Took this bad boy home and took a test bite of the crust which was hand made by it's random patterns. Wow that crust was good, crispy on the outside light and chewy inside.

The chicken tasted like chicken not packed chicken corpse wrapped in plastic and thrown in so many freezers over the years, very generous amounts of bacon in coarse chunks, and lots of cheese.

The basic red sauce was THE BEST, chunky and very flavorful. Nice hunks of tomato and onion gives it.

Overall this is the BEST calzone i've ever had.

Will update when i go back for a pizza or an italian beef sandwich"}
{"text":"Chicago style pizza! Yes! It had to be authentic Chicago style, since I don't believe I had it ever. Only thing I ever that was remotely close was Bostonized, but that ain't Chicago - at least where I live. Used to the normal chains of Dominos, Pizza Hut, and the rest of them, but coming to a Chicago style pie joint is possibility made in heaven, I gotta say. After getting my pint of chocolate ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery relatively nearby, my Fitchburg friends and I stopped here at Rosati's for a delicious pie that could not be beat.

Located on Mineral Pointe Road in the heart of Fitchburg, there is no shortage of parking spaces here, unless you have come on prime time and need a space. Rosati's is within the Clock Tower shopping complex on Mineral Pointe road, nearby the Saigon Noodles I had been to the night before on Odana Road. Plenty of food choices out here. With that in mind, my friend and I ordered take out instead of dining in, so this review is just for the counter service and the food items we bought. I had ordered the 14\" Rosati Monster with the double stuffed crust, along with a side order of mozzarella sticks.

Let me tell you that I had thought about getting the 16\", but when that 14\" came out, that monster was crazy huge! And I thought I could have tanked a medium Pizza Hut pizza without any problems. I guess they don't call it the Rosati Monster for nothing! The pizza itself was a meaty cheesy monstrosity that could not be tamed in one sitting. I tried my best, but I could just manage half of it while saving myself for Cold Stone, which I took out 1/4 of it along with the mozzarella sticks before calling it a night. Guess ill be having the rest of it for breakfast and lunch sometime. The pizza itself was rather good and heavy, so that was a feast in itself. I really did enjoy myself with this pizza and hope to do it again soon. The mix of meaty and cheesy was so good, I guess that mixture is total bliss. And it was!

The counter service was ok at best. Everyone was moving around like it was crazy busy that night, but whatever works to get everyone's orders straight and make everyone happy and satisfied. They take credit cards, so that always awesome. That made me happy. They also have a dining area / restaurant, so that's nifty, if you choose to dine in here one of these days. Glad we phoned our order in, otherwise, we would have been waiting quite a long time for our order. Glad we made a pitstop at Cold Stone first before coming here. Overall, this plus is a serious recommend for sure. If you enjoy Chicago deep dish and Authentic made, this place is the one to go to. Just 3 hour drive northwest of Chicago, its pretty much the closest to the heart of Chicago if you are craving something from the source, but not willing to drive to the source. Rosati's is your best bet ever!

{"text":"Best NY style pizza I've ever had in Arizona.  Cheese and sauce perfection.  Thin crust delicious.  I went there and ordered.  Brought a book to read.  Took about 40 minutes but no big deal. They were busy and that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I've been eating here or getting pizza delivered since they opened this joint. It was really good at first and has slowly gone down hill. Maybe they are owned by somebody different than the tasty Scottdale location?

Going keep this short and simple. The quality of the food and service at this location is always CONSISTENTLY HIT OR MISS.

Sometime it is great and other times it is awful. The last few pizzas that were delivered to the house had black (burnt) cornmeal covering the entire bottom of the crust. This is simply an oven that is not being maintained properly and most unfortunate.

Since this is not about trying to graduate with a 2.0 or better and I'm not going out of my way to apply the Bell Shape Curve to my past dining experiences ... BIG MEH!

2.25 STARS"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Rosati's location as you can dine in and the pizza is SOOOO much better fresh from the oven!!  I have only ordered the thin crust and probably will never venture elsewhere on the menu because it's so dang good!!  Just like the Rosati's chains back in Chicago except for my absolute favorite location has an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet!!  Then again, maybe it's a good thing they don't have that here....  :)
Their prices are not cheap, and they get dinged one star for that."}
{"text":"SO FRUSTRATING!! Every single time I have gone there (almost monthly) they are out of something and usually it is pizza. They are called rosati's PIZZA for a reason yet they never seem to have it. On Valentine's Day/Ash Wednesday they were out of CHEESE PIZZA! If they really cared about their customers and wanted to run a profitable business you think they would actually provide what their name is."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and they were sooooo fast!  Pizza- I love it!  If you like thin crust with sweet sauce, this pizza gets no better.  Greek salad-  Pretty good.  The salad at Lino's is waaaayyyy better, but this one isn't bad.  I tried the chicken alfredo also, and it was just tasteless.  Cheesecake was good, but just prepackaged, so don't expect homemade."}
{"text":"Rosati's is amazing. Everything I ever eaten from there made my palette do a happy dance. I have never been disappointed. Their customer satisfaction on top of the he cleanlyness of the facility makes this my go to spot for sure."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a ZERO I would!  Here's why:

1. Being from out of town, when I learned that there was a Rosati's near where I was staying, I was ecstatic!  Being away from \"home\" (Chicago), I always miss the traditional Chicago foods. I've eaten at various Rosati's restaurants my whole life, starting with the original locations in Chicago; it is a \"must stop\" part of anytime spent in Chicagoland. I know first hand from so many experiences that the quality of the food and service of Rosati's is amazing.  Which is why I've been a loyal customer for 20+ years. This location is a privately owned franchise, and in NO WAY resembles any Rosati's that I've eaten at, from the food to the service (or lack thereof).

2. I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich, which is a very distinctive sandwich (especially to a Chicagoan), from the seasoning, the way the beef is prepared, to how it is sliced. The beef in their sandwich was no different from a standard roast beef sandwich. I also ordered it extra dry - so not only no au jus is added, but the meat is also supposed be dried by hand (basically wrung out); that way the bread isn't soggy at all. The sandwich was dripping when I picked it up.  It was also cold.  When I told the server, she seemed indifferent to the fact that, not only was it not how it I had ordered, but cold. When she went in back to \"fix\" the issue, I heard the cook say \"This is f***ing ridiculous. That's how it's made, roast beef no sauce, that's what I gave her.\" As I said, Italian beef is a distinct sandwich, so a roast beef sandwich is very different.  When I got my second sandwich, which I saw being made, it was EXACTLY the same the first, save slightly less soggy, but still cold in the center.  

3. The customer service was inexcusable.  There was a pleasant, new employee taking our order.  However, when she did not know how to enter customer requests (like \"dry\" and \"cut in half\") and asked for help, her trainer (Cheryl) patronized her, and instead of teaching her how to do it just started punching in the order herself, acting as if my requests were an inconvenience.  Then, when I had a question about an item on the menu, she responded as if it were an imposition to answer customer questions.  When I had made my complaint about the horrible sandwich, she flippantly said, \"Well, this isn't Chicago and this is the closest you'll get to it here.\" (Paraphrase) Also stating that the beef was ordered and shipped from Chicago, as if the meat's origin alone made it authentic, and that it took away any responsibility from it's actual preparation in the store and what was served. Only after we complained twice did she show a modicum of customer service.

4. We ordered garlic knots as an appetizer, and not only were they so oily that there was a puddle in the bottom of the basket, they were so over-cooked that they actually crunched!

5. The pizza was bland, and not at all what a Rosati's Pizza is. It was made with cheap ingredients, mainly the cheese, which was so oily it dripped off the pizza.  My husband was only able to handle 1 piece of it, and it made him feel queasy for quite some time afterward.

I realize that this review may be nit-picky, but as a long time customer, I went in with the expectation of getting everything I love about Rosati's. Unfortunately, I got nothing resembling what Rosati's should be.  Everything about this visit was disappointing, and I will never eat there again when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the pizza, but the Alfredo sauce is awesome! Delivery is a HUGE plus!!! Try the ribs"}
{"text":"Pretty good and reasonably priced. Not the best ravioli that I've, had but it wasn't bad either. Not good for really eating in as there isn't much dining space, but it is clean and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered from here using GrubHub.  Let's just say we are not impressed at all.  First, they were not ready with the food when the driver got there so we got the food 20 minutes later than expected.  Then they forgot one of the meals which made us waste more time figuring out how to split what we did receive.   Now onto the food.   For the price it was not acceptable.  The portion sizes are small for pastas they say they feed 2.  And the taste was ok at best.  This restaurant is going on our never again list between making it more difficult when we needed an easy night and the actual food."}
{"text":"I used to order from Rosati's all the time and we absolutely loved the pizza and wings. We haven't eaten there in quite awhile [at least a year]. I have been craving pizza so I decided that if I was going to eat pizza I wanted GOOD pizza.  Think again. 

I ordered the crispy thin pizza and it was not what I expected. The pizza was NOT how it used to be. It honestly tasted like a cheap frozen pizza. The crust was thick, hard, and greasy. Not the light crispy thin crust that I was used to. However, the sauce and toppings were still very good but, for me, the crust makes the pizza. I am really sad that they changed the crust. Not impressed and we will not be ordering from there again. I would rather order from Dominos. :("}
{"text":"Once again, this LOCATION ONLY absolutely sucks!  They have the worst customer service and have no clue how to run a pizza shop!  They have yound kids working the phones that don't have a clue.  On top of that, they have been charging higher prices than the menu states since gas went to $4+ per gallon 3 years ago.  They could print new menus and new prices if they don't intend to change them back.  Sounds like a wieghts and measures call to me.  Was in the restaraunt to pick up a pizza several years ago and saw a stack of papers sitting in the corner about 3 feet high.  I asked the girl what that was.  She said the bosses office!  Tells me right there he doesn't have a clue and doesn't give a shit.  It all starts with perception, makes you wonder how clean the place is too?  If you want to wait an hour and a half for an ok pizza, give them a call."}
{"text":"The meatball sub is very good. The peppers are super sweet and the bread is nice and fluffy! The wings are an interesting shade of red but are delicious and mild is perfect, can't wait to bite into my cannoli! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my son & used our $20 Groupon. Food was amazing as always. Carrie was very attentive & nice! We will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza. Was a go to when I live in Vegas. Not much else to say about a take out only pizza place but if you like deep dish give them a shot. Just remember it's a lot of food so default to the smaller size if your picking between two sizes, we've made that mistake a couple times. 

Tip: also there wings are not bad either"}
{"text":"To begin with, I have only had delivery from Rosati's, and have not eaten at the actual location.  The first time I ordered from Rosati's was last year after they left a flyer on my door, and simply put, this is the best Chicago style pizza I have ever had.  Rosati's has five different style crusts to choose from, and I would recommend the pan or Chicago-style; other types include traditional thin crust, double dough, and stuffed crust.  When ordering the pan or Chicago-style you have to allow 30 to 40 minutes for its preparation time, and believe me, it is worth it.  The price for Rosati's pizza is a bit pricier than more commercial delivery places like Papa John's or Dominos, but unlike those places there is a much higher quality to Rosati's pizzas.  I cannot even begin to express how good the pan and Chicago-style pizzas are, and they are seriously filling, two pieces and I am completely full.

The pizzas are only a small portion of the full menu, there sandwiches, salads, hamburgers, pasta dishes, and other various sides and specialty items."}
{"text":"Showed up on Monday night at 8:55pm. We got out of the car, walked in to just be looked at from the waiter and cook both standing behind the bar area. We said hello you are still open right? I asked because as we walked in we kind of got that feel like they didn't want to attend to us. And I looked around and just one couple was in the dining area and it looked like they were finishing up. She answers and says oh we are closing early today. And I said but you close at 10pm. She said not tonight we are closing at 9. So I packed my family back in the car. We made the drive as a treat for us as it had been a long soccer practice this evening to be turned away. Never making the drive again as much as I love their pizza I felt it was rude of them to turn us away."}
{"text":"Great chicago style pizza. Legit chicago deep dish and good chicken parm too. Can't go to wrong if your looking for good pizza."}
{"text":"I decided to hit this place after work. I was craving a deep dish pizza. I called to see how long it would take to bake a small, I was quoted a time frame which would fit in my schedule. 
I found out that it was a bit longer than the quoted time. 
The pizza was good. The ingredients are good. It's above the \"chain\" pizzas around town. 

Will I be back? Likely."}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native I was excited to try them out. When we got our pizza it was soggy and wet. Horrible experience. When they sent us another one it was all over the box.  We will not order from this location again."}
{"text":"Good food, decent selection, open late (for you partiers), decent delivery time."}
{"text":"While most pizzerias in Vegas are obsessed with pretending they're from New York, the best pizza is from Chicago--thick crust, fresh ingredients and tasty sauce.  So delicious and substantial that one slice makes a full meal.  

Rosati's has brought the genius of the Windy City pizza pie to Vegas and they've done a brilliant job.  Most delivery places in Vegas will bring you a pizza 1/2 a step above the frozen cardboard you find in the grocery aisle.  Don't wallow in pizza mediocrity.  Order a pie from Rosati's and learn what you've been missing."}
{"text":"If a Yelp review could be two words, it would be \"underwhelming & disappointing.\"  Black parts on the soggy wilted salad and I would love to see the bag their \"cheese\" comes out of.   As a Chicagoan, I will encourage you to seek your Chicago pizza fix elsewhere.  The only silver lining is that the gals at the counter we're very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great and lots of it, I had a fantastic dinner and leftovers for lunch the next day it was really good. I would recommend it to anyone.
I will be back again real soon.
Great family run business keep up the good work thank you!"}
{"text":"Ok, so my son wanted pizza at 9:30pm so I yelped this place. Sounded very friendly over the phone. The pizza was delivered as promised but i gotta say. This was the worse pizza and most expensive I ever had. My son even said that this was worse than dominos. If you are craving for pizza stay away from this place, save your money or go to Mcdonald's instead? Nothing could be worse. Not worth a star but this won't let you post with out one."}
{"text":"I love all pizza! Rosati's is my second \"go to\" pizza place if Grimaldi's is busy lol I LOVE the delivery and they have never been late. Sometimes the people taking your order talks too fast or they don't really explain too much when it's your first time ordering BUT thats ok! Pizza makes up for it LOL"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the level of customer service that I recently received from Rosati's. I ordered a monster pizza a couple weeks ago and when it was delivered it was extremely soggy.  When I called the restaurant to inform them of the quality, I was told that I would receive a free pizza to replace the poor quality.  I called back Rosati's this afternoon to request my free pizza on Father's Day and was told by the manger on duty they could not honor their promise due to the fact that there were no notes in the system and the last order was not the same pizza.  It's extremely disappointing as we are (were) frequent customers.  I hope the service and customer experience improves in the future or their customer base will decrease rapidly.  It's sad to see this type of customer service this day and age especially considering all the options available."}
{"text":"Ordered thin crust pizza and double dough pizza.. both pizza were good it was my first time trying the double dough it was good but very filling!!! Delivery was fast I'll be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"Love this place. Hubby and I were wondering why we have never been here up till now. Their Chicago style pizza is well worth the wait!! It does take a touch longer, but order a drink and chill. Their staff was so nice, and accommodating. We went in when there was a big college game going on, and they had it on almost ever tv. Everyone in the bar was cheering, and having a blast. Even though there weren't many people at the late time we came in, the energy was amazing. We will be back...soon and often!!"}
{"text":"Truly the best think crust pizza on the planet!  Blows away Pizza Hut, Dominoes and Pappa Johns.  A 14 inch will feed about four people.  Also incredible chicken wings, antipasto salad and angel hair pasta with marinara.  Nice to be able to order delivery from a place that has more than just pizza and wings!

{"text":"I should have definitely read the reviews on this place first.  I am from Chicago, this was not real Rosati's. The food was okay.  I ordered a pizza and a salad and it took an hour and a half to arrive. I left a nice tip on my credit card when I made the order... that was a mistake. So if you are hungry, I'd suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly service. They're very attentive to their customers and actually take time to talk to them."}
{"text":"Top 3 best pizza  I've ever had great customer service food was made fresh I'm definitely only eating there pizza from now on"}
{"text":"Ordered penne chicken Alfredo and penne a la vodka with chicken. Pasta was over cooked and chicken tasted like it came from a TV dinner. Frozen and then reheated. Alfredo sauce lacked salt and flavor. A la vodka sauce wasn't too bad. I don't think we will be eating there again."}
{"text":"Good but too pricey for what they serve (not much better than the big chains).  They should go on groupon and lower prices and this place could be popular in an area without a lot of options."}
{"text":"Absolutely pathetic excuse for chicago deep dish pizza.

There is nothing deep dish about this pizza. You are better off ordering pan pizza from Pizza Hut. Spent $25 for the standard pepperoni mushroom deep dish I got nothing that resembled chicago deep dish.

It was 95% 1.75 inch bread topping barely any toppings and I was dumbfounded at this excuse for chicago deep dish pizza. What a fucking rip off.

There is more cheese in a little Caesars medium pizza then in a Rosati's deep dish and that is absolutely disgusting.

Somebody prove me wrong.

Grimaldi's, where are you when we need you?
Please please please open up on the west side."}
{"text":"New owners as of April. Grand opening and the pizza is awesome these guys are from chicago and know what they are doing when it comes to pizza. They have a new phone number 480-551-7000 call for delivery or pick up, its right by mountainside fitness on 116th and shea."}
{"text":"Was hungry & stopped for a quick polish sausage. the Polish sausage was almost $7 and it was the smallest little thing I've ever seen! major rip off"}
{"text":"excellent pizza, dough balls and service! first time we tried your pizza tonight and the 25min drive to go pick it up was well worth it too!!!! :D we will be ordering from you guys again real soon!!!! :D"}
{"text":"Placed order an hour and twenty minutes ago. Still waiting. Person who answered the phone didn't seem to think this was unreasonable."}
{"text":"Good pizza and nice staff. They are very sweet with out kids and really nice about things like us bringing a way old restaurant dot com."}
{"text":"Really great pizza. We ordered over the phone for deliver and the lady was really nice, professional, and courteous. We received our delicious, Chicago-style deep dish order within 30-40 minutes and the order was exactly what we wanted. I wish they had left it in the oven a minute or two more so that the center crust was a little more cooked, but it still tasted amazing.  We scarfed it down like it was no one's business."}
{"text":"If I'm going to eat a bunch of cheesy calories on a Friday night from my couch - then only Rosati's calories will do.

The pizza is the best delivery pizza in town. But that's not my favorite part.

The team taking orders over the phone is capable, kind and actually enjoyable to work with. Every time I call I think, \"Where do they find these awesome people?!\" That USED to be my favorite part...

But tonight... the delivery guy trumped all.

While waiting for the pizza to arrive, I suddenly remembered that the duct tape I had plastered all over my doorbell to prevent unsuspecting delivery people from ringing it lest they wake my sleeping children and face the wrath of a woman who now has to deal with two awakened toddlers - (breath) - had finally fallen off and I hadn't yet replaced it.

\"Oh shoot!\" I said to my husband. \"I forgot to re-cover the doorbell! The pizza guy is going to ring it and wake the kids!\"

Just then, there was a knock at the door.
Whew. A knock. NOT a doorbell. \"That was lucky.\" I thought.

And that's when I heard the delivery guy say something to my husband as he handed over the pizza.

\"Hey, uh, I thought I remembered there was a sign or something not to ring the doorbell last time I was here (at least a month earlier) ... so I thought I would just knock instead.\"

Delivery guy? Or angel. You decide."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this location for the first time in years-- I remember why I haven't now. The employees at this location throw each other under the bus over who screwed up the ranch dressing on the order. The driver blamed the cashier and then the cashier lied stating the driver forgot it. I paid for it and SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED numerous times that ranch was important for my daughter when I ordered. Then I spoke to a raging manager named Melanie  who said the driver gave my ranch to another order. It would have been forgivable if my pizza wasn't cold and when I called to complain about all this, their manager was pleasant. Instead, she was extremely hostile and rude. She hung up on me when I asked how they were crediting my account instead of giving me my money back. During the call she also said I must have had a horrible day to be upset about the situation. What terrible management and employees this location has."}
{"text":"Meh. My family has ordered Rosati's a bajillion times, and I have never liked it. Today's visit confirmed that for me in case there was any doubt. Ordered a medium deep dish meat pizza, fingers, spicy beef sandwich, and cajun fries for pickup. $54 for all that which isn't so bad imo. But sadly the food is just not good. The pizza was dry. I was expecting a pie smothered in tomatoe sauce, but there was not much sauce at all. Fingers were nothing to write home about. Just frozen tenders of chicken. Fries were not cajun how they were ordered, and soggy. The beef sandwich is my favorite thing on the menu, and it was just ok. There are so many other pizza places in town that I probably will never from there again."}
{"text":"Came in and sat at a table.  It's Friday night but not too busy.  We got ignored for 15 minutes.  Tried to flag someone down and everyone is behind the bar and not paying attention to tables.  So we got up and left...  It's a shame since the food is good."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today around 4pm. Went with my 2 little brothers, my son and my boyfriend. 

Walking in the places ambiance is inviting and friendly, we were greeted right away and sat ourselves and the server was with us immediately. ( My boyfriend noticed an employee in uniform taking advantage of the beer Tuesday special, I'm assuming she was off shift but maybe she should have taken her uniform and apron off at least ? )

We looked at the menu and were excited at the variety of food, everything from appetizers like fried pickles and mozzarella sticks to full on pizza and steak dinners. 

We couldn't decide there were so many options !! 

haha after some deliberation we decided to get a large rosati style deep dish pizza (half meat mania and half Hawaiian), some mozzarella sticks, a small individual thin crust pizza for the kids to share and we took advantage of the Tuesday special with their 60cent wings and got 30 wings with different sauces (mango habanero, hot, medium, and BBQ) 
(Listen to the server when she tells you that Hot means HOT!!! Lol )

Drinks here are self serve, and the fountain machine is easily accessible. 

When the food came out, it was fresh and steaming. 
Mozzarella stocks came first and they were absolutely delicious ! 

Kids pizza came next, which is awesome considering the kids are impatient and hungry lol

They devoured the individual thin crust pizza in record time and were completely satisfied. 

When our Rosati style deep dish came out, we were in shock.  We may have underestimated the size haha ! 

It was .... HUGE.  Absolutely delicious but enormous lol 
One slice was so filling we had to take the rest to go lol 

The wings came out shortly after, looking delicious and after trying them the sauces are great, HOT is definitely HOT and my boyfriend couldn't handle the heat haha but hey he was warned haha!  Mango habanero is one of my favorite wing sauces and here it is deliciously sweet with a kick.  
The only downside is that the wings seemed overcooked and extra crispy.  So it wasn't as good as we would've liked.  Still tasty but could've been better. 

Our server was attentive and great in every aspect, checked on us often and was completely sociable and explained everything when we had questions.   I messed up by forgetting her name ! 

We left completely stuffed, and will be coming back to try the other options."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Ordering from a chain pizza place is cheaper and at least edible and it will get to you in a reasonable amount of time. Not only did I wait 1hr & 20 mins for my pizza to get here, it was made wrong and it tasted like it was also waiting for 1 hr after it was made, cold, hard cheese, too much sauce, no flavor and rubbery and burnt dough!  Unfortunately this isn't the first time that the food has sucked, I given plenty of chances and every time we're disappointed. Definitely will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Too bad Rosatti's has jacked up their prices... I just cancelled the order to go with NYPD as even before coupon they are a much better value and NYPD is a superior pizza!"}
{"text":"The food is good but they seem to not like answering their phone. Been trying to call for a while now to order a pizza and they do not answer. Its sunday afternoon and Says there open"}
{"text":"Pizza is life, and their pizza is like an IV.  I can't help myself when the thought crosses my mind, I have to order. Delivery is generally prompt (less than an hour on a busy Friday night) and the pizza is comparably better than any of the national chains. Do yourself a favor and skip the hut. This place is worth the extra few bucks"}
{"text":"If you have a gift card that was purchased prior to new management taking over this facility, don't bother trying to use it because the new management will not honor it.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Best service. Great food. Good quality! Their pizza is fab. Appetizers, sandwiches. And desserts rock it too!!"}
{"text":"This location has moved to Eastern.  We thought we should try it again after 2 negative experiences over a year ago.  Wish we would have stuck to our guns.   Three strikes. ..  It is sad, because we really enjoy some of the other locations.   This time,  they forgot an item,  charred both pizzas and didn't even attempt to cut our large pizza.  Oh yeah, all of that was after they put us on hold four times during our order.  Too many good pizzas out there to waste another dime here."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait about an hour and a half for delivery.  We ordered online thru grubhub.com.  The food was good, fresh and hot.  Here's what we ordered and paid: 

Fried Zucchini, 12 Classic Buffalo Wings, Chicken Parmigiana Pasta, and Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich = 28.99 + 2.26 tax + 3.00 delivery + 3.00 optional tip = 34.25"}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering and we are BIG pizza fans. From the online ordering experience to the delivery person to the quality and flavor of the food.... Rosati's is by far the best we've tried (and we've tried A LOT). We tried the gluten free crust and it was awesome... thin and crispy, not too chewy. This will be our regular pizza delivery place from now on!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Our guests couldn't get enough! We ordered for a party of 50+ and had plenty of delicious food and many options! Thank you for making our party stress free! Will definitely be ordering again for the next get together!"}
{"text":"We only ever get their food delivered. But it is always amazing! Sometimes they forget my meat sauce but I don't even care usually because I love the food. If we need a go to delivery that comes quick, hot and fresh Rosati's is always my go to. We never have any left overs even though their portion size is huge. We eat it all because their food is just that amazing. I've gotten delivery directly from Rosati's and they are always so sweet and nice on the phone!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently tried Rosatis a few weeks ago since we both have been wanting to try it for some times. 

We ordered the Chicago Style pizza.....it was fantastic! It is a pricey and a small will feed 2-3 people. 

I know I rated it onl 3 stars, I cannot give it more yet since I have tried anything else yet. 

I would strongly recommed this place for pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Came loaded with toppings, hot, fresh, just like a dream! One look and I new this is going to be our pizza place. The delivery was fast, too"}
{"text":"Called in a lunch special today. Usual head over to the location.near Troon North but today had to visit this location. Should have saved my $10 and chewed on my cars back bumper.  Food horribly over cooked to the point I spit out first bite and could not even try a second. Fries scolding hot outside freezing cold on the inside probably microwaved. At least the soda was cold. ."}
{"text":"I got thrown into having to order pizza for a speaker here at my job with the U of I.  Having never done that before, I was lost.  I wanted to order pizza that wasn't something you can have anywhere, so I chose Rosati's.  I needed pizza to feed @ 40 people and they did not fail.  The manager, who sadly I cannot remember her name, provided me the best option to feed the masses for the best price.  They delivered right into my office, even arriving 10 minutes early which was amazing.  Everyone LOVED the pizza.  They were easy to work with, the order was correct, the service was great.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm an arse, I wanted 4 1/2."}
{"text":"The Rosati's on Cheyenne is awesome.  The food is absolutely great and Ray is the best!!!  A super clean facility with a great customer service"}
{"text":"We order from this place occasionally and never had a bad experience. I like the pizza and meatball subs. We also will order the tray of Alfredo delivered to the house for the family. 
Overall a pretty good place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch special. I was going to get two slices and a drink, but one slice looked sufficient, so I went with that. 

All the pizzas look like cheese pizza because the pepperoni and the sausage are buried miles below the cheese. You practically need a magnifying glass to see there's pepperoni in it.

Here's where the story ends: One bite, and the cheese/pepperoni came off all at once like a wet blanket, leaving only the tomato-sauce covered crust remaining. Um... okay.... so, buh-bye to that whole slice of pepperoni as I bought it and hello to a remaining piece of dough covered in tomato sauce.  Yummy if I had a hangover and didn't care. Not so yummy if all I wanted was just a slice of pepperoni pizza. Is it too much to expect that cheese and pepperoni to remain on that slice of pizza until, oh, I don't know, I'm done eating it? Shouldn't some cheese and pepperoni remain on that slice for a second bite, and third bite, and a fourth bite, and a fifth bite, until I'm done eating it?

Taste-wise? Well, not sure how accurate my assessment would be as I had to chew it all up all at one so I didn't spit it out and then re-eat it (because that would be gross.) But I did taste a lot of cheese. And I could tell there was some garlic in it. Sorry I can't describe the taste with any more accuracy than that. 

Peter Piper Pizza is better than this. Heck, even a frozen pizza is better than this.  If I ever return, I will be sure to bring a knife and fork to be sure I don't lose that slice on the first bite."}
{"text":"It is always so hot in side. It took forever to get the food. Once you get the food it's so hot you can't touch the food. The workers are nice and every 10 minutes they ask if you need anything. The food is amazing. Just wish it was a little cooler so you would like to stay longer and hang out."}
{"text":"The Rosati's Pizza on wigwam & pecos was not only the first in Vegas, but my first job as a teenager. I love this pizza!!! Went to the rosatis on rainbow and it was just like I remember, tried this location last night and what a catastrophie! 

Franchise, means consistency & unfortunately this location needs to be re-evaluated! Not only did I ask for x-tra crispy on my pizza and the Cheese was barely melted, but my medium wings were ON FIRE!!! 

Needless to say, it was a terrible meal & I was up all night! I called To give feedback & no one even tried to get a phone # to call me back or credit my account (not that I would go back)"}
{"text":"I ordered at 6:24 from the Yelp App and the system said 45 to 60 minutes.  I call an hour and 40 minutes later and I am told the order just went in the oven. Do not order delivery from this establishment especially from the Yelp App. Still waiting two hours later."}
{"text":"How do I put this nicely, I can't they've been to my house twice and still don't have my pizza- this is after I waited on hold for about 15minutes and called twice to get thru to tell them the first time my order was wrong. Delivery person cursing his own store out at my door. 2 hours and still waiting on my pizza, TERRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Rosati's Pizza.  Good news pizza was ready when I was finally acknowledged for pick up and the food was good.

When I arrived the customer service was bad.  The girl at the register basically ignored me and didn't make eye contact.  Just kept typing on their computer system.  Then the second employee comes in shows frustration because a driver left food on the counter.  Picks it up and throws it down . She continues to walk back in forth trying to get a hold of the driver.  Sorry Mario the driver.  Looks like you messed up."}
{"text":"Can't base this review on their food, only the service. We called our order in, and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. Went to pick it up, and was told it wasn't ready. Waited 20 more minutes and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. The place? was EMPTY. We cancelled the order and left. We will never go back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on a Friday night so 45 min wait I was ok with. They came on time and EVERYTHING WAS FRESH and hot. The only downfall is my salad was really dull and plain i ordered a side salad. Other than that everything was amazing which was the hot wings, 3 cheese baked penne with Italian sausages and cheesy garlic bread"}
{"text":"Easily one of the top pizza places in town.  Thin crust is the way to go but you can't go wrong with deep dish either.  The only downside is the price.  It is pretty expensive but I will usually pay for the best."}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would. I called an order in and was put in hold twice by two different people. Then a man answered the phone rudely asking my order I placed my ordered and they quickly said ok got it bye. I should've gone with my gut when I thought hmmm they didn't ask my name or phone number like previous times. A half hour later I went in to get my pizza and the lady who was working the counter looked frazzled, was answering the phone taking orders. She hung up the phone calling the customer a Bitch. Then a guy came out saying we don't show your order. I said I guy with an accent took it. He went in the back and I could hear 3 men going back and forth denying they did. He came up front saying they all said they didn't take it. I even showed they guy my phone showing my phone inbox showing that I did call, and he still denied it. He then said he would give me 25% off my order. But after hearing the lady up front call a customer a bitch and them basically calling me a liar. I choice but  to go across the street because I didn't trust them to make me a pizza. I do not recommend this place at all very unorganized and when I told them I was writing a review the guy smiled and said ok. NOT RECOMMENDED ! Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Jamie our server was amazing.  Kudos to him and his customer service skills.  
Our pizza was on the table in a very short time from when we put the order in and was exceptionally delicious!"}
{"text":"Ever since new ownership and management took over service and food quality has been horrible. 
Used to love this place for many many years. This used to be our family pizza place until few months ago everything has went downhill for this place. It's unfortunate that for the past 6 years this was our all time favorite pizza place and recommended this all our friends and family. It's a shame!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, waited for our food for an hour while everyone who came after us got their food in less then 20 mins. Hardly checked up on us and when we needed something we had to wave her over. Food was pretty decent, but considering we waited so long I figures it would be delicious instead of \"pretty decent\""}
{"text":"I would drive to Chicago before I would go to Rosati's Pizza again. I had to call three different stores to find someone who would deliver to my home just to end up picking the pizza up and the staff at the restaurant tells me to they do indeed deliver. But that's not the worst part. 

I ended up waiting an hour and half and when I asked the manager what he would to to compensate us for our wait and inconvenience he rudely gives me a number of excuses including having a new person at the oven, not knowing who originally took the order and even going so far as to call my husband a liar when he said the pizza takes longer than the original 25 minutes we were quoted for a wait! I left with no dinner and a hard fought for refund. I will never again visit this place - and unless you want to waste a Sunday evening I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Pizza here is $$$. But, for the price, you get a different style of pizza from your mainstream places. 
I do like the fact that we were able to make a gourmet style thin crust pizza (anchovies,pepperoni and onions) that was delicious. Everything tasted fresh, as this was a delivery order. 
I also ordered a medium white pizza with spinach only, but they still put the tomatoes on it. So, they already messed up on the very first order I called in. 
The cheese pizza seemed a bit burned but everything was still palatable. I think this place is okay..I still think Rocco's is the best. 
The fact that this place delivers gave it another star."}
{"text":"dont waste your time or your $. i ended up here because Barros shut down. Large 2 topping at Barros is $13. Here it is $25."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. we got the Chicago Style pizza and dough nuggets with drinks and of course a cannoli!! The pizza was the best we've ever had!! you and taste  the freshness in the ingredients. I love the dough nuggets too!! these tasty little fella's can hold there own against any appetizer!!  We also met one of the owners who was very friendly and helpful. I love this place!! best pizza in all of the land!! the delicious cheese that is now clogging my arteries is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have no idea what is going on with these other reviews! Yes the pizza is pricier than dominoes, but the price is comparable to oregano's just on gilbert. 
I'm from Chicago and the thin crust at rosatis taste just like back home, everytime my dad is in town we order an x large pizza with mushrooms and sausage. That is the best combination invented! 
I also cannot speak about the delivery as I usually pick up my food, but every time I'm picking up the tiny store front is always packed! Perhaps being really busy means slow delivery times. Trust they are not alone oregano's told me once it would take an hour and a half to simply pick up my pizza. People must love pizza in gilbert
Overall give these guys a try, but stick to what they are known for.... THIN CRUST!"}
{"text":"This is one of my husband's favorite pizza spots in Madison. We like dining in and enjoy the casual atmosphere of the dining room. I love the chopped salad!"}
{"text":"Great looking little place the calzone is huge and very good decent  place. The place isn't to bad for what the  price of the food get decent bang for your  buck"}
{"text":"$32 dollars for a pizza with no sauce in the middle. Need I say more. Too bad, I wish this place was better since I can walk there from my home. Huge miss for Rosatis in DC Ranch."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for delivery about 6 times now. I feel that is enough times to have an idea of how a place runs consistently. 
-Order takers sound rushed (yea I'm a customer too ok?) annoyed and bored
-Food is consistent. Pizza is as described. My husband prefers it more than I do. Pasta dishes are ok actually. Not overly greasy alfredo sauce like some other places. Their ravioli is only one that is underwhelming . No overcooked noodles. Sauces are mild yet tasty. 
-I have tried: alfredo spaghetti balls ravioli and lasagna.
-their wings is where they stand out. For me anyway. Crunchy. Good sauce. Good cut or type chicken.  
-Appetizers are confusing as in you are in able to order about 3/4 things that shows on website or menu. Updating perhaps?

Only other comment besides it is ok/good food, consistent at least, orders delivered with in the hour and nothing missing is that it is just---- so so expensive.

Whenever I pay the bill I can't help but think - for goodness sake I could have went to ocean club or a fine steak house! 

But I didn't. I wanted to stay home in my pjs and have food brought to me that is average by annoyed people"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so I'm pretty picky about pizza!all Rosatis are a little different but this one is the best yet! Highly recommend it if you want some good Chicago pizza for delivery."}
{"text":"We had a cheese pan pizza. If you are looking for Chicago style deep dish, this is not the place to find it.  The crust was pretty bland, there was very little sauce and the cheese was just ok.  Overall the pizza was bland, with too much crust compared to sauce and cheese. We probably won't return here, at least not for the pan pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great wings.  A little more than I like to pay but the pizza is better than your regular take out/delivery pizza.  The salads are also good.  The service has improved since it first opened.  I usually order one to two times a month."}
{"text":"ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the large size feeds 6. It was very good, lots of sauce and meatballs were delicious, will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"I have some friends that live in the Phoenix area that I visit every year.  They brought this for take out and personally, I think it's the best pizza.  I realize everyone has their own tastes but for me this does it.  Great taste.  Thick pieces.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"So I'm flying solo this trip out west.  My friends got this to go and by far the absolute best Chicago style pizza I have ever had.  Not over cooked or burnt like I've had in the past.  This was outstanding."}
{"text":"Thanks for the best experience and food, our family has been enjoying your pizza for over 20 years , whether it is this location or your take-out restaurant on McClintock in Tempe, Az."}
{"text":"We all went in for lunch after we heard there were new owners. The place has been remodeled...very cute and very clean. We all got something g different so we could share....the pizza, lasagna and salads were delicious!! 
The waitress was very fun and personable. The wings were too saucy but everything else was great!! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I understand that this location is under new ownership but the only thing that stayed consistent is their stale garlic bread. We ordered our usual, family-sized baked mostaccoli with marinara, and the tray was 1/2 the size for the same price! Also, they have chosen not to include salads with this order anymore! Then we tasted the food and it was comparable to the sauces off the shelves at Walmart. we used to love Rosati's, but I guess their new ownership doesn't get it. Besides that, they were rude and uninterested in resolving our concerns. We will never go back, and I advise the same."}
{"text":"I had Risati's Pizza for the first time today. I had them deliver so I can't comment on the restaurant appearance. The driver arrived right on time and my order was correct. To be honest about the pizza, it wasn't the worst or best I have ever had. I would rate it just above average. I will be putting this place on my list of lunch spots."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years from this place and recently their food sux and their customer service is awful. Not only their prices are outrageous the cashiers don't know how to be polite and are very rude. We are done and they get a big F."}
{"text":"You know those places that refer to themselves as Chicago or New York \"favorites\", but people from those cities have never actually heard of them?

Well , being a Chicago native, I can tell you that Rosati's was not necessarily one of my \"favorites\", but it IS a place at which real Chicagoans eat, and it's pretty good!

Not great, and frankly not even as good as the Rosati's in Chicago, but it's still a cheap and easy way to beam yourself out to the midwest for an hour or so.

Stick with the thin crust pizza. Although Chicago is mostly known for it's deep dish, thin crust pizza cut in squares like ths one is actually what most Chicagoans eat on an every day basis.

When people argue about \"Chicago pizza\" vs. \"New York pizza\" I always think they should use the thin crust pizza rather than the eep dish. It's much more easily comparable. 

Don't get me wrong, Chicago deep dish pizza is one of the country's greatest delicacies, but it's moe than just pizza, and for that reason it really can't be considered in the same conversation ith other pizza from around the country, or even around the world. 

Why did I just go off on that tangent? No idea...has very little to do with Rosati's."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza is great. I always get the Meat Mania. Staff is really nice every time I stop in. Only thing I dislike is that when I called to order no one told me the specials. When I got there for my pick up I saw all the special, which were great deals for basically the same price I paid for a large pizza. I suggested next time I call to state the specials but I was told that if we don't ask it was ordered no to suggest a special.  So basically if you don't ask for a special they won't inform you of them. Bad customer service to me but it won't stop me from going back. The cashier was nice and gave me coupons and Rosati's buck for my next order."}
{"text":"I ordered online tonight and, 2 hours later, I called the restaurant to check on the order. The woman checked with all the drivers and no one had my order. She said that I could order again (and wait another 45-hour) or get a refund. I told her I wanted a refund. Very disappointed, hungry, and now it's late at night and have very limited options at this point. I will never be ordering or eating at this restaurant again and definitely do not recommend it."}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA I have ever ordered and had delivered. I just got a new job today, I do not normally eat pizza, but was feeling great, and felt like I could splurge. I was going to go to Classic Italian Pizza, but thought I would try Rosati's Pizza since they were closer to my house. What a fool I was. I ordered a Med. pizza, with pineapple, olives, and pepperoni, and received a cheese pizza barely sprinkled with anything. What a let down, especially since I had waited so long for the pizza. Four of the pieces were pathetic. A piece had 1 pineapple on it, another piece had 2 olives, a third piece had NO INGREDIENTS on it except the cheese, and the fourth piece had half a slice of salami. Not only were ingredients lacking but, the crust was also burnt on a quarter of it. I would of done better picking up a cheap $5 pizza from pizza hut. I will NEVER order from here again. 

Besides the pizza, the delivery guy didn't even ask if I wanted peppers, cheese, or even leave me napkins! what the hell! Never again, never ordering here again."}
{"text":"Two words. $50.00 delivery. 

More: This pizza is not worth $50.00 it's pizza for crying out loud, PIZZA! I'm sure some people can go into great depths on taste, texture, gluten, where the wheat is picked from, the water source..but...$50.00 for a one delivered pizza! ugh!! If you had to choose to impress someone with your inability to care about how you spend money..this is the place."}
{"text":"At first we sat at the bar and the bartender didn't really give us any attention. Then we decided to syay in the dining room area and the waitress was really good but she was extremely busy with all the tables she was serving so we waited a long time to get served. Finally when the food came out it wasn't even all that so would I go back to it? Probably not. So I recommend it? No!"}
{"text":"Have had all of the desserts several times. So so good. Really- 5+ stars. Mozzarella sticks- no. I got 6 breaded  overly greasy empty sticks. I can't imagine how a pizza place hasn't got that nailed. I'll just stick with your sweet stuff - don't lose the cannoli!!! Oh, and the delivery is fast & friendly!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan.  

My wife and I found this place through an online coupon deal.  We ate there, and were not happy.  Service was slow.  The salad was soggy, and the pizza had to much sauce and cheese.  We have the deep dish and thought maybe we just didn't like deep dish. 

The next time we ordered the thin crust to go and still were not happy with the pizza.  The sauce wasn't that great, and there was tooooo much cheese .  

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Firstly, it seems this location doesn't appear on the company's website... not sure why.

In any case, I stopped in for a quick bite for lunch.  They sell by the slice, which is nice, and at 12:30 p.m. on a Wed., I apparently got the last one.  Good for me, but as I was sitting there eating, several different people came in wanting a slice and were told they were out.  Huh?  Do people not each lunch after 12:30?  Put another pie in the oven - jeez.  As such, every single one of them left without being offered a different suggestion.  I'm not sure who owns this branch, but I was astonished to watch as money repeatedly walked out the door.  Maybe they make enough $$$ off delivery at night.  

In any case, the pizza was ok - but nothing special.  But to be fair I had a single slice and not a made-to-order pie.  But I give them a 2 stars because the employees couldn't be bothered to keep a pizza place stocked with pizza, or suggest some other menu items in order to feed the other lunch seekers.   In fact one sat in a booth most of the time and another was surfing the net when I left."}

{"text":"Although my appreciation for 50 cent wings on tuesday has me spending my ruffage(money), it doesnt mean I enjoy this strange vibe I get when I'm dining in. 

Came in with the sister around dinner time, dead on the customer count, the lady at reg had no genuine skin on.  I might as well feed my money into a machine and out pops a basket of wings that I can sit in my car while I eat to 90's music: paula abdul; because that's what it felt like, except my car doesn't have a table, so we sat in. She dropped off the basket of wings to our table and walked off. So where am I supposed to leave the bones? In the same basket of freshwings? Offered no plates or wet naps, or anything. (based on previous visits here, I've been treated better).

Luckily I love their wings, but on this visit, the host wasn't that eager to serve us either."}
{"text":"This deep dish pie of heaven from Rosati's was literally a dream come true! The perfect dinner for a lazy Sunday movie night. It was jam packed with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and black olives (we made it up!). Before this, I honestly didn't think that the famous pizza joints in Chicago could be beat, but now, I seriously think otherwise!!! {Yum, my mouth is watering just writing this post.} The slices are so big that you can literally be full after 1 slice! A small deep dish will definitely feed 4 people."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Super friendly waitress every time we go in. Love the thin crust pizza.  Would recommend to anyone wanting quality pizza."}
{"text":"waited 45 minutes for an extremely burnt-out pizza that tasted like a dog-toy. the other small cheese pizza wasn't even cut. the employees here at this location obviously do not care about the food they are providing their customers. I use to think this place was OK, but after the past few experiences, I think the employees are drinking or smoking something while on their shifts; they just do not care at all. I will no longer be doing business with any of these establishments and I suggest you all do the same."}
{"text":"We were excited to see the place reopen.  We have ordered carry out twice and have been very sasified with the pizza and service.  

Ordered double crust cb/pep both times."}
{"text":"This place is awful! Food is ok and everything, but hearing the employees in the back yelling and cursing is not ok. Every two words was F this or F that. Talking to the guy at the register was like talking to a brick wall. He had his headphones in and wasn't paying attention. Nobody in this restaurant wanted to be here. Customer service is awful, it's almost like they didn't want us to be in here. I love Rosati's and this is my first time at this location. I usually go to the one on 59th and Union Hills which has exceptional service and employees. This is my first and last time at this location because it is awful. Order delivery because you definitely don't want to come in."}
{"text":"New management and it's awful. The prices have gone up a crazy amount! It's absolutely crazy how much they've gone up for just pizza and toppings. There's plenty of other pizza places for way cheaper that will be getting my business. Boo!"}
{"text":"Their website http://www.rosatispizza.com/ and Yelp both read 11am open for business. It is now 11:42am and I have not been able to get a hold of them. This was an order for a company catering event. They just lost out on that sale. I will not call this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The customer service was good but the food was not good at all. Had a deep dish and a regular pizza and they were both under cooked. The wings had way too much pepper."}

{"text":"I'm waiting in the lobby for our pizza as we speak.  Its like a fucking ice berg in here.  In the lobby.  Freezing.   And the front counter people are rude as hell too.   

When I got the pizza home, it was ok.  I would never go back here though.  I can't tell you how cold it was in there, literally shaking.  Nice and warm in the back, I'm sure.  Customers come second."}
{"text":"By far some of the best pizza I have ever had. I have only dined in once and the service was just okay. Not too much to say about it since it was just a quick meal. Food came out in a timely manner. 
For the most part, I am always ordering pizza for take-out. I usually get the same order and they always give me a time frame between 20-30 minutes since I get Chicago style pizza. They have not failed me yet. I live right around the corner from them so I give them 25 minutes before I leave and I always see my order waiting for me to pick it up as I walk in. In my experience, great place and I'll definitely keep on ordering from them."}
{"text":"I had a horrible delivery experience. I placed an online order for delivery around 630 pm. I received an email,saying it would be delivered between 805 and 820 pm. I thought this was a long time for pizza delivery, but it was Saturday so whatever. At 845 pm I called in to find out where this pizza was. They told me it got put in the pickup window and had been sitting there waiting to be picked up. The lady was very nice and took ownership for their mistake, so she said she would make a new one and as soon as the delivery guy got back, it would be on the way. At 930 pm when the pizza finally got to the house, our guests had already left, and the pizza looked horrible. The only good thing I can say is they were nice and took ownership, I'm not happy I waited 3 hours for 1 pizza and still had to pay for the entire thing."}
{"text":"Just ordered a 16\" stuffed pizza that was there version of the meat lovers. I just wanna start by saying I was skeptical at first with all the bad reviews that I have read on here but it was the best otasting/looking pizza I have ever had! The staff was super friendly when i walked in and after getting my food i was about to just have a seat and eat it there! I will def keep ordering from them if they keep that up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to splurge on once a month or so! I love their italian beefs and their brushetta! The pizza is great but i ask for the thicker crust although their thin crust is really good too!  Fast delivery and they never mess up our large orders!"}
{"text":"Food is good.. but SOME of staff is very very rude. When I ordered from this location the girl on the phone very rudely stated \"You know there's a location closer to your address.\" not kindly very rudely. Yea I do but the menus at each location are different. She basically said I don't want your money. Then the pizza got delivered to my OLD address she didn't even ask what address was correct just quickly hung up the phone. When I called to tell the girl its been a while since the food was ordered I figured out it was the old address and of course she was ticked off and even more rude. Thanks but no thanks wont be ordering here again. MAMA DE PALMAS is the place to go food  is better and staff cared about my business."}
{"text":"Good food, but service not so great: when I arrived to pick up the order I called in, my husband called to say the location just called and the order would be delayed (actually not unusual, I usually have to wait 10 minutes longer than they say). So I walked in, figuring I would find out what was going on, and come back if I had to. So I asked about my order, the guy in back started explaining what happened to another employee (different from the message left on our home machine), and then the girl behind the counter asked me if I was at the right location. Since they didn't know which end was up, and she kept asking me about the location as if I didn't understand the question, I left in disgust. Went home, saw the correct location was up on my computer, called the number they called me from about the order delay and found out that the order was marked for delivery, not pick up as I had asked. I pointed out that was not what I requested and that I had come in to the correct location. They eventually delivered my order."}
{"text":"We called in our order ahead of time, 2 large pizzas and an order of breadsticks. The staff was friendly. Pizza was good."}
{"text":"They deliver to hotels. This is pretty much the reason I eat here. The food was ok. Nothing to rave about but nothingnto really complain about either. I will probably order again."}
{"text":"Well worth the investment.
Great pizza.  My favorite in the valley by far!
It may be a bit more expensive than some others, but I devour every cent, every time!"}
{"text":"I visited this place twice and decided to give my view because it is very important that management know how the customer feels about the service. First and foremost, this is a very clean restaurant. I don't think they will ever be on dirty dining and I like this place because they seem to understand a customer want to eat somewhere that looks very sanitized. Both times I visited, when the cashier(s) were not taking orders, I noticed them staying busy cleaning and keeping the place tidy. So if your looking for a clean establishment this is it. As far as the pizza, I am from Chicago and we grade pizza tough. We have been so spoiled eating great pizza that it is hard to get 5 stars from us unless you can match Giordanos pizza. No offense. However, their pizza is an excellent substitute and it is good. I saw a review in which someone complained that the pizza was to hot. Are you kidding me? I wouldn't have it any other way. If it was not that hot and I just ordered it I would be concerned. To each it's own. Overall, I was very satisfied both visits and will visit more often when I have a break in my finances."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery. One pizza ..half pepperoni and the other half mushroom, spinach, tomatoes and garlic. Gave credit card over the phone and awaited the hr + wait for a pizza. When the pizza finally arrived, the order was completely wrong. Half the pizza was mushroom and pepperoni and the other half just mushroom and garlic. Also when they came to the door they hadn't swiped the card and said there was no card on file. Okay who took this order?! I don't understand when you have one job to do... Take a customers order... How hard is it to follow through to get it correctly? I mean this isn't rocket science stuff. It's a teenage job position. You should be able to execute this pretty easily. They did give us a credit.... But this post is more for management to view who they have working for them. It will make or break your business."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. We always enjoy ordering, delivery times are appropriate for pizza places. Though, this experience I had today not so great. Instead of doing delivery my partner and I decided to pick up. The restaurant was slow and only we were in there. The cashier was awesome, very friendly, younger guy w a little longer hair. The 3 star review comes from the 2 other guys I'm guessing they were cooks in the back, all we could hear was f this and f that. The one younger guy with brown hair did see us out there before he went to the back and started swearing with his friend. I'm not sure they realize or care they can be heard in the front. Very unprofessional. Management may want to check into this because if I had kids with me, I would be irate."}
{"text":"Add me to the list of people with MAJOR issues on the delivery accuracy and customer service on this place. 
People in my office used to order from here all the time. At least 4 or 5 times each week - sometimes several deliveries in one day. And we considered it one of the best delivery options we had.
Then orders started getting messed up. More often then they were right. More people here refuse to order from Rosati's than are welcome to take the risk - knowing it's more than likely they won't get what they ordered or how they ordered it.
About six months ago, I ordered for three of us - and there were several issues. When I called, a woman claiming to be the manager offered me a $10.00 credit.
When I called for the next delivery and tried to get the credit, there was no record of it.
My last straw was last Monday. I thought I was brilliant by ordering online - where I could specify anything specific and it was all in clear print - no chance to mess up, right?  HA! I ordered a an Italian beef sandwich with peppers, onions and light mozzarella; a small Greek salad and a brownie for me. Also got cheese sticks with marinara for one coworker and the \"duo\" (shown on the menu as fried mushrooms and zucchini) with ranch for another.
Delivery came in one hour, 15 minutes. Everything was lukewarm, including the salad. The cheese sticks were barely edible. The duo came with cauliflower instead of zucchini (would not have been ordered at all if cauliflower had been advertised) and the ranch was missing. The mushrooms were referred to as glue by the coworker who ate one, and threw away the rest. My sandwich was OK. Not great, but OK. And the salad was fine - after I put it in the fridge for a few hours. I'd love to tell you about the brownie - but it wasn't with the order.
I called and spoke with a gal who claimed to be the manager. She offered me a credit, or she could send a driver back with the ranch, some zucchini and my brownie. No luck with the last credit I was offered - and I really didn't want to wait another hour for ranch (no longer needed, as the food it was requested for was thrown away) and my brownie. I asked those items be refunded to my credit card.
I was told the owners would call me the next day.
That was over a week ago.
Rosati's on Thomas - I am sad to say you have worked your way onto my DO NOT CALL list. My coworkers were right. I was wrong. Enjoy my money - you won't be seeing any more of it. And I can't think of anyone from my office who disagrees at this point."}
{"text":"i LOVE rosati's!!!

When working in Glendale, they are my go-to pizza spot.  I loved them when I lived in Chicago and was thrilled to find out they had locations here.

I seem to desire pizza during peek times so delivery time is a bit poor.  Totally worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Pizza here is way too expensive for the quality you get. One pizza will cost you over $20, and it's just not that good. Pizza is my boyfriend's favorite food, and he even wasn't impressed by it. We'll stick to Pizza Hut or dominoes, and if we're really craving good pizza, we'll just make our own. We definitely will not be back."}

{"text":"Ordered (2) cheef sandwich, spaghetti with meatballs. Salty as hell and the meat ball was either over cooked or left over from another day. No taste at all in the spaghetti sauce. I'm diffidently not coming back here again. Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Rosatis was my go to for pizza...the cheese was always a golden brown on top just how I like it, other places I have to ask to make my pizza well done to get that. But not today..order my pizza, get home and open the box to sooo much cheese it slid off on the drive home, not browned at all and frankly appeared not done. Disappointed, I go back with the pizza. I open the box to show the guy working and he says \"wow what happened, I did not give you the pizza that way it had to have happened on your drive home\". Told him that's not why I was bringing it back but it was not cooked well on top and that is not the standard I'm used to from them. He proceeds to call the cook out front when I tell him I don't need to see the cook but to just refund my money as I was disappointed with the pizza. He then says I'll refund your money but I'm not giving u a discount on your next order. At this point I tell him no problem and his comment was \"how about this, how about you never order from here again\". All while another customer is waiting for their food. 
Seriously? Because I'm voicing a complaint one time while I've been ordering from there for years? I'm blown away that someone in customer service would make a comment like that and lose business. I will say their food has gone downhill and not what it used to be but, WOW. 
If you want great pizza and customer service, make the short drive and go to Vito's!!"}

Salad was horrible.. and small I pay for a large salad same price at Oreganos and it feeds four people.. This was lettuce thrown in bowl with huge thick slices of cucumber..Smh.."}
{"text":"Not New York pizza. Not sure what true Chicago style pizza tastes like but I think their pizza could have been better. The crust is disappointing."}
{"text":"Wow, so we live about 1.5 miles away and this one of only 3 restaurants within 10 miles of our home.  Every 6 months or so, we get desperate and try Rosati's again. I promise we won't make the mistake again. 

We have two small children, and when it takes more than 45 minutes for our food to be served, it's tough. Especially when there are only 2-3 other dining patrons in the restaurant. 

We got drinks quickly, but the server admitted after 20 minutes that she'd forgotten to come back to take our order. And, the apps we ordered with our drinks took about 45 minutes. After about 75 minutes, we needed to leave, as our little kids were restless. 

Last time, I promise."}
{"text":"I had been craving pizza for a week straight and finally decided to do something about it. Ordered a thin crust veggie pizza from Rosati's, just because they are close to home and have decent reviews. 

After checking on the web for their phone number - supposedly the only Rosati's in Nevada - I ended up calling the wrong location. Apparently, there is Rosatis.com and MyRosatis.com.  I don't know what the distinction is, the logo is the same - maybe franchises vs. company owned?  At any rate - for any location other than D.I. and Hualapai, you need to use MyRosatis.com.  It doesn't help that the location I was looking for was at Cheyenne and Hualapai - soooo confusing.

OK - I admit, I'm not from Chicago - so maybe I just don't \"get\" Chicago style pizza, but what is up with square-cutting a round thin crust? This way, the center pieces don't have a crunchy crust to cheesy-dough ratio that makes pizza enjoyable to me. If it were a square pan or deep-dish it would make sense. The pizza tasted OK - I found the crust a bit flavorless.  I dunno - it's fine I suppose, but for the price (18.00 for a 14\" veggie) I'd rather go elsewhere. Sorry Rosati's - it's me, not you."}
{"text":"I've always ordered Rosatis Pizza's, being from Chicago I figured it would be the same as the Chicago tasting pizza. Loved their pizza  in the beginning until an evening in 2012 when their driver hit my car and the owner refused to take the blame. He even went as far to tell me his driver was never at my house! If his driver was never at my house then how did he know the date of the incident? Funny how people refuse to admit the truth.  I never reported to the police because it was only a few hundred dollars to fix so I fixed it on my own but when I did bring it to the owners attention he was in complete denial and refused to deliver any more pizzas to my home. He said I was a risk! I didn't hit my own car, his driver hit my car.

Funny thing is after about a year we started ordering again and they  continued sending our pizzas over the home with no problem. Tonight, January 4, 2017, four years later, I called to have a pizza delivered and they refused to deliver my pizza. They said I was too much of a risk  to come out. When I spoke with the owner and asked him why he's been delivering to me for the last four years and now all of a sudden he decided to not deliver, his answer was this: if you've been getting pizzas from us for the last four years it's been a mistake. I'm wondering how thousands of dollars later to Rosatis within the last 4 years, the owner just now decided it was a mistake? As I told Ed (wouldn't give his last name) what a big mistake on his part, not only has he lost a very good customer but the way he spoke to me on the phone is absolutely ridiculous. Their customer service is horrible, their pizzas have gone downhill and if you complain all they do is apologize but never fix it the right way. The only reason I was going to order Rosatis tonight was for my sons and their friends from Chicago.

Mr. Ed didn't have a problem taking over $400. From me though when I ordered Chicago style Hotdogs for the Cubbies game. One thing I will tell anyone ordering, if you don't complain about anything wrong with your order, if you don't report an incident that happens with one of their drivers Mr ED will continue to service your orders.
Rating for Mr. ED and his customer service techniques are definitely a big ZERO. 

Not only did Mr. Ed lose a lot of business but I will take this to the corporate offices of Rosatis."}
{"text":"If ZERO WAS A CHOICE  THATS DEFINITELY WHAT IT WOULD BE. i go in at noon to get lunch and only had sausage or cheese to choose from ready made pizza slices , that's it period they wouldn't even make me a beef sandwich. BYE"}

{"text":"I have eaten here a few times already since they opened. Their pizza is fantastic and their service is even better! All of the employees are super friendly and the pizza comes out tasting amazing every time! The double dough is my favorite, although the deep dish is great too! And...don't forget the Cinnasticks!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, they would deliver to our place of business many times, then all of a sudden they started saying things like \"we are too busy to go that far\" or \"we dont have enough drivers on today\" VERY LAZY. Why would you deliver like 20 times, then suddenly stop to a regular weekly customer!?!?!  NO THANKS. also the pizza is like $23 too. Metro is a better option now."}
{"text":"By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. 

Much of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. 

Rosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right. 

Eat up and leave your calorie counter at home ... or else it may explode."}
{"text":"I am beyond displeased with my order from this place, I ordered cheesy garlic bread and got some sour thing I don't even know what to call it; on top of that the cashier acted like she couldn't have been bothered to help us. I know it's closing time and you wanna go home but don't let the customer know that as well. Would never returb"}
{"text":"They make that pizza where you think it's just a slice of cheese, but hidden beneath all that cheesy greasy goodness is the good stuff (pepperonis)."}
{"text":"We were a little scared to order after reading reviews.  But convenience won and we took a chance.   Just ordered large thin crust pizza and Greek salad for pick up.  It was ready in 30 min as promised.  Our tummies are very happy.   Pizza crust was crispy (as thin crust should be), tomato sauce was good and there was plenty of melted cheese.  Meatballs and giardinara completed the pie and items were well-distributed across the surface.   Greek salad was just fine though the addition of Asiago cheese and absence of cucumbers and oregano was a little un-characteristic.    

Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place in the world to eat pizza! I ordered pasta and salad from this location and I have to say that it was amazing! The girl on the the phone was very polite and helpful. The pizza was at my door in 25 min. from the time I ordered it. I ordered here before and when it took 40min. to get here they gave it to me free! They have obviously worked on there organization skills because this was Saturday night and it got here fast and hot!"}
{"text":"I had extremely high hopes for this place and was let down. The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the extra $2 charge for the meatballs seems over-the-top. I ordered the Cheef sandwich and my Dad ordered the Philly Cheesesteak but based on our experience they are the exact same sandwich. The Cheef says it comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers...when I asked for both I got charged 49 cents twice for the peppers. The menu says nothing about an extra charge for these items but says you can add them to other sandwiches for a charge. In my experience when it says \"comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers\" you shouldn't have to pay extra for those peppers. Both of the sandwiches were alright though they came with an ample amount of fillings. Both of the sandwiches came with beef and although there was plenty of the beef it was basically flavorless. The only flavor mine had was from the $1 worth of peppers. The desserts were also very disappointing. The picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade. The tiramisu we got was a frozen, pre-packaged triangle that didn't have much flavor. The two cannolis we got were also pre-packaged and frozen but actually had really good flavor. All-in-all I'm pretty disappointed.

I would consider going back to try the Chicago style hot dogs and their pizza."}
{"text":"Our local store on Lake Plesant is closed... this store at first was great but our last order deep dish pizza was sloppy and looked liked they poured it into the box. Had to scoop out the slices that were not easily defined. The spaghetti and cheese  ravioli were still terrific +5 on te yum factor. The salads are about as good as a prepackaged Walmart salad but the overall a solid high 3 or low 4 consistently. Pricey but when it's right it's delicious."}
{"text":"Well, DISAPPOINTED!! I've had Rosati's deep dish Chicago style pizza before and it's delicious. I've really been craving it lately so I went for lunch. 

I arrived at 12:25 and seated myself. After about 3 minutes of waiting, I asked the waitress if I could have a menu. She seemed put out by this...brought me the menu but said \"Can I just take your drink order for now?\" It wasn't busy inside the restaurant, maybe 2 other parties. I can only guess that they were busy with deliveries or whatnot. I ordered a beverage. 

At 12:33, no one had brought my drink or returned to take my food order. 

At 12:36, I watched several people walk in from outside and put in take out orders. My food order still hadn't been taken. 

12:40. So, after 15 minutes of not having my drink brought or food order taken, I left. It really wasn't my intention to leave such a snotty review about the bad service here, I love their pizza, but come on. 

PS I came to Grimaldi's after I left there and am enjoying a sangria and antipasto right now. Mmmm"}
{"text":"I'm reasonably certain my next review for Rosatis will be higher!  Here's why.

The young man working there wouldn't have been more courteous and the service was fast.  The restaurant was clean which is absolutely essential to me.   We had pizza that was already prepared and ready to go.  I can't say it was the best in the world.  I don't know that maybe it was a type that didn't appeal to me.  It didn't look like it had been prepared and waiting for to long.  I said I wanted a basic pizza so the young man did his best to help me get what I wanted.  I did notice they offer five types and mentioned to Norma that we might try the thin crust nest time?

Now the good news.  While my friend Norma and I were sitting there, a large Italian looking man had a very large pizza delivered to his table.  It was a deep dish cheese pizza that made me salivate just looking at it.  Obviously this has to be one of there specialty pizzas and we missed the boat by not knowing to order it.   We certainly will next time!

They offered something I am not used to seeing-chocolate chip cheesecake.  Norma said it was good.

One thing I did appreciate about Rosati's.    They had two large screen TV's set to sports channels.  The volume was set to a level that a normal person could enjoy it!  How nice to be able to watch the game and be able to discuss it without having to scream to be heard.

I am really looking forward to going back for that deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"Good food, not amazing for the cost.  I'd love for this to be my local pub, but the service is spotty, and worse, they keep the door open between the bar and kitchen and after having lunch there, I smelled like greasy pizza all day - yuck.  Reading the other reviews, I think they have a serious management problem and I don't expect them to be around long unless they straighten up."}
{"text":"So we are from Chicago, pizza was good. But can not get past how filthy the place is.  Went into women's washroom toilets look like they haven't been clean all week, toilet paper all over the floor.  The back room had broken chairs and garbage/junk everywhere. Not very profession,, don't think I will revisit."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because they deliver and Oregano's does not. I ordered a pan pizza with pepperoni and it was okay. For such an expensive little pizza the crust isn't really flavorful and there was very little pepperoni. I guess that's what I get for being lazy. Next time I'll just make the drive to Oregano's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love Rosati's! We're new to the area, and our apartment gave us coupons and a free pizza from this location. We have been buying pizza from here since. We are hooked! 
There are different crusts, toppings, and sauces to choose from which is perfect for whatever mood you're in. The pizzas have always been cooked perfectly. The breadsticks are awesome as well. We haven't had any of the other items yet, but I frequently make pasta and lasagna at home. So I'm usually looking to satisfy my pizza and breadstick cravings.
Besides the food and most importantly, the staff, they are so kind and friendly! They really do go above and beyond."}
{"text":"I love their pizza, but ever since the new owners have taken over it has been nothing but a disaster. Last night we waited almost 2 hours for a pizza, I finally called and they said their driver was pulled over by the cops and had his car towed so there was a delay. SO instead of making us a fresh pizza, they delivered us the one that sat in the car for almost an hour. They have no concern or care for their customers."}
{"text":"Second time we ordered pizza.  Love it.  Both were awesome.  They advertise 45-60 minute delivery....Nope.. both time got our pizza under 30 minutes and it was HOT.  This is my new go to pizza delivery.  Owners super friendly.  Ordering on line thru Yelp super easy."}
{"text":"Called this store cuz the eastern store said they'll deliver to my house even though I'm in their 5 mile radius. When I called, they said they'll deliver in 5 miles radius as well but not to my house (3.9 miles) lazy assholes"}
{"text":"When I called, they said they'll deliver in 5 miles radius but not to my house (3.9 miles) and they said to call another store. lazy assholes"}
{"text":"The GOODYEAR Rosati's has always been very good to us!  I think their menu has changed over the past 6 years or so, but the pizza remains outstanding!  We normally went for the thin crust combo - very basic, very excellent crust!  The toppings are so good that it doesn't need a ton of crust to make up for it.

I have yet to try their deep dish or Chicago style pie but it's on the list of \"to try\" items.  I'm working in the middle of Phoenix right now, so I'll be trying the location close to the airport.  But when we lived in Goodyear, Rosati's was as good as it gets!  Memorable enough that I always get a pizza from here when I get the chance to stop by Goodyear for old times' sake!

**UPDATE** I have since had their deep dish Chicago pie twice and it is unbelievable - count yourself lucky, Phoenix, to have access to this type of pizza in your area - it's a rare treat!"}
{"text":"Normally the pizza is pretty good. Tonight I ordered from eat 24, and the pizza came in a timely manner. When I opened the box the pizza was over cooked. It certainly changed the taste of the pizza, and I wasn't about it. There was also tons on olives and it was so overpowering. I simply picked them off, but still. Hopefully this was a one time thing."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza
I loved the thin crust
Super cheesy!!
And the chicken tenders were so crunchy and juicy!!!
Pricing was totally fair and reasonable! Will totally go again!!"}
{"text":"Awful. Soggy pizza and chicken that looked like a wet sponge. We threw everything out. Never again."}
{"text":"Been to this location a couple times now and always get the Cheef sandwich. There is no way you'll find a better sandwich for $6.50. The thing is huge and the Italian beef is tender and tasty. Gotta get it with the hot peppers and au jus. Dump that juicy goodness on there and bust out the fork and knife cause you aint picking that bad boy up. I keep saying I want to try their pizza but I have to get that damn Cheef everytime. They even screwed up my order last time (twice) but I gon't care. That sandwich is frickin good."}
{"text":"So...I'm starting this review BEFORE my food is delivered in hopes I can write a higher review AFTER my food gets here. So far my $11.99 small
Pizza went up to $20 and some change because I added garlic and tomatoes, a drink and a $3 delivery charge. Then I was told that it would be 1 HOUR to get my food after I had already given her my payment details....lets see how this goes."}
{"text":"New cooks, wait staff, owner(s), etc...it's been routine to come here weekly to enjoy the greatest service, family feel, best of food and a great way to unwind from a long day at work. The food here isn't the same at all, the wings were horrible and definitely not what I'm used to from this place, which means this will no longer be a routine stop for me and I'm completely bummed. I recently waited at the bar for my order and the NEW owner \"ty\" offered to pay for a beer and wings to a very respectful employee, praising her for the hard work she's given for the day AFTER her shift ended and to my surprise I experienced a chilling scene. The owner inconspicuously began to snap pictures of the employee drinking her beer, which I thought was creepy, weird and and a complete invasion of privacy. I obviously have no idea of the intention behind these actions, I really hope everything is ok. Time to find a new routine stop I guess, cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been dying for some real Chicago style pizza. A friend recommended Rosati's. I called and spoke with Terell, ordered a Chicago deep dish pizza, Pepperoni supreme and some BBQ wings. When I arrived to pick up I was greeted with a smile and my order was ready!  I lifted the pizza up and noticed how heavy it was!  Full of pepperoni, sausage, yum!  All the good things!! By the time we got home I couldn't  wait anymore!  WOW!! IT WAS DELICIOUS!  AND THE WINGS!! SO GOOD! Just the right amount of spices. Thank you!  Delicious!  We'll be back...."}
{"text":"Really great pizza! We've been to three of their locations now and I'm always pleased. This is the best Chicago style pizza that we've found in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"There is a hierarchy of greasiness among CU pizza places. I never thought Antonio's would be beaten. Unfortunately, Rosati's has managed the feat. I realize it's a new place, but the pizza by the slice is greasy enough to detract from any deliciousness. I thought I'd try their other dishes to give them another chance, but they weren't much better. Salads are made of the cheapest greens, the marinara sauce was watery and over-acidic...and horrors of horrors the garlic bread was both devoid of garlic and had a lovely microwave-petrified texture. I won't go here again."}
{"text":"Great old style pizza.  We ordered a thin crust with multiple toppings and everyone loved it.  Great for our family gathering!"}
{"text":"There back!  We have started ordering from here again. And it's been good each time. The consistency is back. This is the best pizza in Gilbert Chandler area."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great prices. Everyone there is so friendly, especially Jennifer. The food...YUMM!! I especially love the wings and pizza! I really appreciate that the food is always ready when they say it is or by the time I go pick it up!"}
{"text":"I saw all the mixed reviews...  I had a very different experience than some I guess because the Pizza  we got was full of premium ingredients and one of the best I have ever tasted, including my own pizza.  We all agreed on that, so..."}
{"text":"Best happy hour. Plus great pie wings and fried pickles good tap slection friendly staff"}
{"text":"First note this is a take out or delivery pizza place only, NOT dine in. I was staying at a local resort and ordered from here. The pizza was a true thin crust and ours was simply delicious. The guy behind the counter said he likes to dip the pizza in the marinara sauce as I ordered the white pizza. He tossed the sauce in for free and gave me a $5 off coupon. This is a clean, quick, and friendly place. Will update if we order again while on our vacation."}
{"text":"Calzone is soooo good! Delivery is always on time and staff is always very friendly! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The service here was extremely sub par. We had a Groupon and ordered food for pick up. I was put on hold for 5 minutes before they took our order. 

We were told the food would be ready in 30-35 minutes. We went to pick it up right on time, but when we arrived it would be just \"5 more minutes\" we waited another 40 minutes before someone else came back out to ask us what we were waiting on. 

Finally, after an hour and 15 minutes of ordering our food, they gave it to us without an apology or anything. We got home and the order was totally wrong. They had given us someone else's food. We called and they said we could come back in 30-35 minutes if we wanted to fix the order. Too little too late. It was 8pm and my pregnant wife was starving. 

Avoid this place if you can....even with a great Groupon, it isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Had a hunger and desire to try some Chicago deep dish pizza and we were not disappointed with our meal...I rolled out of there like a swollen meatball.  For two of us with additional ingredients and two appetizers and a fountain soda with tip, we were out about $50...service was also outstanding."}
{"text":"The food is great the people are awesome the owner is the coolest, but the staff makes my day every visit. 

We always get the pizza and salads and occasionally get the sandwiches that are all so filling. We love this place so much that some weeks we eat here 3-4 times a week. 

Will continue to visit Rosati's for years to come."}
{"text":"Just had an order delivered.  The delivery was about fifteen minutes earlier than the online system said, which is always welcomed when \"watching the game\".  I we skipped pizza for the night.  We got an antipasto salad---  omg I'm so full.  I stopped writing this review to eat my Cheef sandwich.  Yum.  Based on everything I had seen/tried so far I was going to give a five star review, but thought I better try the Cheef first.  That opinion only grew stronger.  I inhaled the first half, dipping each bite into the jus that came in a side cup wrapped up tightly with foil.  I slowed down on the second half as I was getting full, but it was so tasty I finished it.  The salad was good, kids had a meatball sub and chicken strips, wife had the three cheese penne.  Meatball sub is large and cheesy, toasted just right.  Sandwiches come with a side, we got fries with both, they were crinkle cut and still hot with some crisp left.  Chicken strips looked good, got a thumbs up from a twelve year old (none were left for me to try).

I was worried things would be soggy and messy, and I was really happy to get the opposite of that.  It was like they pulled it out of the oven and handed it straight to the driver to deliver.  Another note, the salad was packed in it's own bag to keep it cool.  This is important when you actually delivery your hot food while it's still hot.

My food experience tonight was far more exciting than the game."}
{"text":"I came in for a beer and can't wait to come back. A nice, inviting, friendly environment. Ready to come back for some pizza and wings, they smell so good! Beer was cold in a chilled glass."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Friendly owners and staff. This is a must have in the East Valley for pizza. Best deep dish what what....."}
{"text":"Love the pizza great crust buttery and spices the  topings are always great wish i could order it more 
I always feel that they dont have enough drivers i would start driving for free pizza and just tips 
Lol if i could get a way with it 

Love the pizza people are quite but very nice too"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the ratings are so low, the quality of the food is worth the price! This has and will always be my favorite pizza place. I would rate a 5, but we have received one burnt pizza before- it was still delicious so we had no complaints! Get the Deep dish"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING FROM WINGS!! I normally don't leave bad reviews but felt I should to avoid others  from getting sick. I ordered Buffalo wings for takeout and immediately they tasted bad like they have been sitting out all day and were just reheated..super over cooked. Within 3 hrs I started vomiting and turns out I got food poisoning from the bad wings and I have been out of work for 3 days now. Would not recommend the wings to anyone they obviously have them all premade sitting around all day. Although I did call and tell them the wings tasted bad and manager did not want to credit me for something else so instead they sent another order of wings but BBQ when I originally had mild. I ended up throwing all the wings away and it was a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Heard wonderful things but got a mediocre pizza, Cesar salad and wings for $30 with a coupon! Pizza just blah and not hot and we were on time picking up. Wings and salad ok. Last time for us"}
{"text":"OK, so I gave them another chance. 
Several times actually. 
They have improved substantially. 
Not one bad experience...until now...cause I just jinxed it. Dang!"}
{"text":"Love me some good pizza and wings and this place definitely has that. The thin crust here is very good but the deep dish pizza is to die for. Wings here are also some of the best I have ever had. Although it can take a long time for delivery it definitely is worth it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap pasta, you'll be satisfied. Tastes good, and the garlic bread is nice and garlicky. Delivery was fast and friendly, too."}
{"text":"Embarassed to say that we ate at this Rosati's every week the first year we were here until they closed a short time ago.  I even wrote corporate to see if they would reopen. Just imagine my glee when I found out they would be reopening!   That's where my joy ends.  We ordered the exact same thing we've been ordering and were very saddened with what we got.  If you know Rosati's italian beef (from Illinois or from when this loc was previously open) then you know what I was expecting....  an overstuffed sandwhich with lots of peppers and a big ol' pile of melted cheese...that is sooooo far from what I got.  Barely 6 pieces of meat, you could see at least 2 - 21/2 inches of the bread inside the sandwhich there was so little filling. Disappointing to say the least.  The pizza sauce tasted like tomato soup (???) and was close, but not as good as the old ones.  I'm hoping there is a learning curve with the new management, but not going to hold my breath as I have ordered 3 since they reopened and sadly, they were all the same.   Our search continues for good pizza and beef.... sigh."}
{"text":"Picked up 2 Chicago Deep Dish pizzas for lunch after a night on the town. 1 pizza was veggies, the other sausage, hot peppers, and mushrooms. Basically the taste of cheese dominated these pizzas with a seldom taste of topping -- a cheese bomb."}
{"text":"It's really sad that the food is so good here, but the quality of service is so terrible. On more than one occasion, I've had items missing from my order and been forced to return to the store to retrieve the missing items. The most memorable one went like this:

1. Order lunch for my office from Rosati's. 
2. Drive to pick up the order.  Ask if both sandwiches are in the bag. Receive confirmation that the entire order is there.
3. Foolishly believe them, choosing not to open the stapled bag.
4. Return to the office and discover that the Italian sub is, in fact, missing from the order.
5. Drive back to pick up the wayward sandwich.
6. Return to the office (again) and discover that the \"Italian\" sub is a roll with lettuce, tomato, and dressing.
7. Drive back (third time!) to Rosati's to have them actually make an Italian sub, while the rest of the food gets all cold and gross.
8. Receive exactly: one (1) half assed apology; zero (0) offers to refund the sandwich that screwed up my lunch hour; zero (0) offers to remake the other food that is slowly congealing while waiting for the SIMPLEST item in the whole order; and one (1) confused look when I asked if I could at least have a free drink or something for my trouble.
9. Be ignored by management while trying to correct the situation in the following days.
10. Never, ever go back. I don't care how good your garlic calzones are Rosati's! It's not worth it!

**I think these are franchised, so it might only be this location that is so, so very sad. They might also not be a terrible choice if you are only getting one thing and eating it there - you know, so you can supervise their idiocy and correct it promptly."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for years, drove by Rosati's a million times, but until recently had never tried there. I'm a little disappointed in myself for not doing so sooner. I've become a really big fan of their pizza. 

I'm not a pizza snob in any way. I'll eat a grab-n-go Little Caesars, Papa Johns, shoot, gimme a Mama Celeste or Totino's and I'm good with that. That said, when you want a little better pizza, one that packs a little more punch on the palate, then Rosati's is a great option. Definitely not a chain restaurant pizza. Their sauce is delicious, they put a perfect amount of cheese, and most importantly the crust is outstanding. The only negative I would say is that they put the pepperoni under the cheese. Personally, I'm not a fan of that, I like it to crisp up on the outside. I made the request to have it on the outside on my most recent visit and they happily obliged. Their pizza is a little more costly compared to a Papa John's or Domino's, but they do have some pretty solid daily specials that I would reccomend. For $20 I got two medium two-topping pizza's which was enough pizza to feed 5 people and have a decent amount of left overs.

Great pizza, super fast service, definitely give Rosati's a try!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Rosati's for about a month now. I have had The Cheef, Meatball, Cheeseburger, Fried Mushrooms, Chicken Tenders, Calzones and the thin crust pizza that they gave us for free was Outstanding. Everything is outstanding!!!!!!!!!! I have also had the Beer Battered Cod Fish, SO SO SO Good. I have nothing bad to say about Rosati's. Delivery is always fast. Delivery driver is always very friendly. I recommend as many people as I can to Rosati's.

This place has changed so much. The quality of their food has dropped. And the cooks just don't care about what they are serving. \"Mild\" wings should not burn my mouth. These \"Mild Wings\" are up in the Hot Range. I know Mild wings. These are ridiculous. Rosati's is On The List!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review got deleted by someone, so I thought I would send it again.  I ordered a pizza a couple of weeks ago from this location.  When it was delivered it looked like this.  Who sends out a pizza looking like this?  Should have given me a refund...."}
{"text":"I moved here from Chicago a year ago, and this Rosati's is just like the one back home that I ordered from frequently.  Consistent, delicious pizza each and every time!  

One of my favorite pizza creations there(not on the menu) is italian beef with giardiniera...it's SO good!  I usually get that on half the pizza, and then I get basic toppings on the other half.  Extra sauce and extra cheese make the pizza perfect, and try out the \"double dough\" option for a slightly thicker crust experience.  Their \"stuffed\" pizza is also very good.

If you like Italian Beef sandwiches, their \"Cheef\" is pretty good.  I recommend ordering it with extra cheese, and a side of hot peppers and a side of beef juice...it sometimes shows up a little dry, so that extra juice to dip it into is money!

The staff is always nice, and delivery service is what you would typically expect at 45-60 minutes."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Rosati's in Madison. Being from Chicago, I was excited to get a taste of home. We ordered a stuffed pizza. The tomato sauce was wonderful, the sausage was pretty good. The crust left me wanting for home, though. The bottom crust was much too thick. The edges weren't crisp at all. And the buttery crust taste wasn't there. The salad was good, as were the dough nuggets. Fried pieces of dough, tossed in cheese and spices. I'll opt for thin crust next time."}
{"text":"Even though the pizza oven was broken, they handcranked it to turn out amazing pizza in half the time! Real cheese, real sauce, real crust. And their  fabulous salad, unbelievable! we also ordered a sandwich,  a hot sub, it was really really good. I don't know what haters are saying this is a bad place. But they are so stupid and crazy! And probably work for a competitor! This place rocks totally!"}
{"text":"*this review is for the 2737 W Thunderbird Rd in PHX location* 

this is one of only a few places on the eat24 app that is close by to my house so my husband and i have ordered from here a handful of times since moving here in feb '14. this time around, i wanted to try new items so i got the xango (a dessert) and the cheese calzone (w/ italian sausage and italian beef as extra toppings). i personally can not eat a lot of cheese so i asked in the special instructions for 'minimal cheese please'.  anyway, the order came and everything appeared delish....

however, i cut into the calzone and found out there was A LOT of cheese in it. which was disappointing for me. yes, i know i ordered a cheese calzone so what do i expect?! but i was hoping i could experience a calzone w/ the toppings w/o the side effects of eating a lot of cheese w/ it since my stomach hates it. so thankfully we ordered in and were not out in public cuz i had to get messy w/ taking the calzone apart to eat it. i had to peel and pick off all the cheese i could and try to grab the meaty bits w/ the calzone to eat it lol. i looked pretty foolish honestly. but when i looked at all the cheese i had to take out of the calzone, it was RIDICULOUS. so i dunno if the person who made the calzone even paid attn to my instructions or what... i did take a pic as proof of how much cheese was in it so if u see it on the site, it looks odd and gross but don't worry, it's just cheese! lol... but yeah, smh, makes me wish i had given in and gotten domino's instead, at least they pay attn to ur special instructions and preferences!

i also got the xango for the 1st time cuz i love sweets. yes, it's a 'cheesecake roll'  so i was risking eating more cheese, but i thought it would be worth it. oddly tho, the filling tasted more like banana (i think?) than cheesecake??? sooo idk what's up w/ that lol. either way tho, abt halfway thru eating it, i just squeezed the filling out of it and ate the roll w/ minimal filling lol, which was tasty btw lol.. 

oh and my husband got a 1/2 lb burger and all the times in the past he got it, the temp was fine (medium well-well done), but for w/e reason tonite, his burger was medium rare (he hates this temp for meat) so he was partially disappointed as well :///

so ultimately, rosati's pizza tonite on 7/2 was a partial hit but more a miss :/ the rest of the time that i've eaten their food, it's been basically the same w/ avg food, nothing special and a few flaws i wish hadn't happened but nothing bad enuf to demand a refund per se. but there's more than 1 location for this restaurant so idk if other locations r better or what..."}
{"text":"The absolute slowest service I've ever experienced. They estimated 20 minutes and I waited for close to an hour. Pizza was good but I won't be going back"}
{"text":"When to visit my friends at Champaign Illinois this sunday, we check out this place cuz my friend recommend the burger with bacon on. I order my burger when i got it it look good nothing big about it, when i took a bite of it it had a lot of greasee dropping off it. It wasnt that great i was probably better off getting a pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and breadsticks.  Delivery was on time and the driver was very courteous.  Will definitely order from them again.  Good value."}
{"text":"After attempting twice to use the online ordering and having it unable to actually send it in to the pizza making elves; we called and spoke to the slowest taker ever. She managed to repeat back everything incorrectly and forced us to have to be on the phone for 9 minutes to order a pizza. We were told it would be an hour and a half before delivery, and it was. The poor delivery driver called and wanted to confirm the address, as he couldn't find it in his gps, the crazy slow talking phone lady had gotten it wrong entirely. It was a complete cluster f@ck. Then the normally yummy pizzas we were expecting came soggy and burnt."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Poor service, was felt as though I was bothering the bartender. Pizza they offered for happy  hour was honestly nasty. I won't be going back.  Sad. As I understand that this is a family  owned  business. Too much competition out there for this."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza in the East Valley. We have ordered from other Rosati's And this one is way different. The pizza taste fresher and better. Definitely ordering again. The pizza is a little bit pricier than other places, but worth it."}
{"text":"This location just wasted my time with there 19.00$ for 2 15.00$ Groupon Deal. A week ago I got an order of there Spaghetti and Meatballs for pick up with one of my Groupons I purchased. Everything tasted a little generic, really average, the portion size is deceptively small. I chose this groupon due to proximity to my job and I chose Pasta cause Im sick of Pizza & Sandwiches. A week later I ordered another Spaghetti & Meatball for pick up, this time I added meat sauce and mushrooms, hoping that would punch the flavor up a bit. This time when I got to Rosati's, I had the pleasure of being attended to by a not so pleasant women behind the counter who informed me that there owner told her that the Groupons were only valid for Pizza, after the previous week before I ordered Spaghetti & Meatball with my Groupon. I was certain that the Groupon add never specified anywhere \"only pizza\", No need to argue, I'll take it up with Groupon, scratched the order and walked out. I went back to the add on Groupon later and all it says is 2 15.00 Groupons for Italian Cuisine, not \"only pizza\". Now I have to waste my time writing this poor review and calling Groupon, so anoying. Pass on this place, for there poor misleading Groupon intentionality or not. Too top things off they lost the value of the Spaghetti & Meatballs, cause I had to walk out before I got mad, at the least they could have done Is given me what was already made, apologized for the inconvenience, but they dident have the for site to give good customer service and except the responsibility for there misleading Groupon. \"Thumbs Way Down\", for this experience."}
{"text":"I have gotten pizza from this
Location previously and it was pretty good, nothing overly special though. I am not writing a review for the pizza, I am writing a review for their burger. I got the chicken breast burger and it was beyond good. The chicken was juice and crispy (even though it was grilled it had some crunch). The veggies were super fresh and the bread super soft. I loved it to say the least. I will definitely be back to try the rest of their food. Ohh don't forget to ask for ranch or is not watery at all; perfect ranch. Ohh and the tiramisu is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Fail. Whale. 

Ok, I know this is not twitter, so there isn't REALLY a fail whale. But if this was, they would get one.

We got a menu from them on our door, so after getting back from vacation and being completely jet lagged, we ordered.

I was on hold on the phone a while. No biggie. Finally, they took my order.  We both went for calzones. I figured it was the easiest way to ensure it was vegetarian.

WRONG.

Not only did it take over an hour to show up, AND they charged us a delivery fee (so two calzones became over $20!), but the sauce had a very heavy meat taste. One bite, and I couldn't eat anymore. Not only that, but because they put the sauce IN the calzone as well as on the side, I couldn't eat anything.  I tried to nibble the crust.

My partner, who is not veggie, LOVED her calzone, and killed in in about 5 minutes. Both of us then spent the rest of the evening in bed, moaning and groaning with stomach aches, and there may have been a few trips to worship the porcelin gods as well.

Fail."}
{"text":"Place is a joke for delivery. I'm still waiting for my food as I write this (2 hours later) order somewhere else."}
{"text":"I come here every so often when I want to get away from the office. Troon is nearby and I enjoy driving in the foothills of the Pinnacle Peak area.  The pizza is not bad and they have Vienna Beef hot dogs if you're in a Chicago frame of mind. Fyi, Rosati's is an Illinois based pizza chain."}
{"text":"Groupon offered a $1 lunch deal yesterday at Rosatis, so I thought I'd give them a second chance. It turns out I just wasted my time. When I showed up to pick up my order I was told that my $1 deal was supposed to be a $15 deal and that if I wanted to pay an extra $14 I could get my food. This is wrong on several levels, one of them being that it seems pretty obvious they were trying to cheat Groupon. Venders get 50% of the Groupon price, so if it was really $15, they would have only received $7.50. 

I left without my food, which I assume they had to throw away, because they wouldn't honor their Groupon."}
{"text":"So far we have only had pasta dishes and salads. Their pasta dishes are bland and uninspired. They seem to think that fettuccine alfredo and carbonara use the same sauce but they are not. The sauces taste like they use flour in them which is not how these sauces are made. The lasagna is pasta noodles, ricotta, mozzarella and red sauce. Sure you can make a lasagna like that but you better use great herbs and spices which they don't so it is very bland and uninspired. Last nights salad had plenty of brown lettuce, not very pleasing to look at or eat if you happen to miss removing it. 

I read one review that stated the original owners had sold the restaurant and the quality of the food has gone down hill. A common mistake by new owners.....to bad.

Reviews for pizza seem to be good so we might give them another chance.

Delivery people are always very nice."}
{"text":"If you are from Chicago and want thin crust pizza, this place is where to go.  Just like back home.  I like how they have hot Giardiniera for sale on the counter.  Cant find it anywhere in the stores around here."}
{"text":"I dont mind paying for good pizza and wings. I do mind paying for average pizza and average wings. There are so many good pizza spots in vegas I'm disappointed I payed 40 dollars for a pizza and dozen wings that was average at best. Im not from chicago so maybe  I get it but the crust on the pizza not very good. To be fair the rest of the pizza is good. The wings were clearly frozen and then tossed in sauce. Nothing great, and then to cap it off, my biggest pet peeve for a pizza spot is when they water down the ranch. I know we are in a recession but quality should not be the first thing to go. I do have to give credit to the delivery guy, i love when i dont have to ask for parmesan and crushed red peppers. With the variety of choices for pizza available in summerlin I probably wont order again."}
{"text":"The new owner Danny is awesome, very helpful and super friendly! He is on top of things and goes above and beyond. The best customer service I have experienced. The pizza is very tasty. 5 stars all the way, 6 if I could!!!"}
{"text":"this is the worst delivery experience i've ever had...i ordered $35.00 worth of food at 7.17 pm an hour goes by and i check status they say it's left the restaurant and is in route..well i wait 20 more minutes then i check status again they say sorry they really busy but was assured me that my order was on its way...ok at 9.pm i check again and they tell me my order was delivered 30 minutes ago...\"what\" you have got to be freaking kidding i've been waiting outside my house over 45 minutes with my sister and they say i got my order....bullshit  we didn't get shit...!!!! i won't ever order from here again ...i used a damn credit card to order i think you better start checking for id when delivered to people's houses...you really suck..!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pie, good price served up fast. what more do you want?"}
{"text":"This is a nice little pizza place with decent food prices are a little expensive but if you get the Groupon it's all good.  The music playing in the dining area was great. Stick to the deep dish for pizza or go calzone for the win."}
{"text":"The best Italian Beef sandwich I've ever had outside of Chicago.  Fries were also great.  If you like Italian Beef sandwiches, give this a try with the hot pepper mixture."}
{"text":"We had read the reviews and checked with a few others that have posted here and decided to give it a go. 

Our philosophy is you need to try a place at least twice to make an honest decision.
We ordered online for delivery both times, last night (friday) was our second time ordering. 
The online menu and ordering process is very user friendly and if you want the tip can be added at that time. We got the \"Monster\" specialty Pizza and a antipasto salad (which is easily shared by two people when you have pizza also) which is full of great ingredients. 
We both can honestly say that this pizza is the best we have had in quite awhile. We ordered thin crust which was done correctly nice and crisp, the toppings were ample! No skimping there. I chose to add jalape√±os and roma tomatoes to the dish.
Yes, it was cut in square shape pieces but in the long run it kept us from OD-ing and going into a pizza coma. 
Leftovers to snack on all weekend long. 
Both delivery drivers were extremely pleasant and the order was delivered in the time frame posted when I ordered online. 
So yes we do recommend Rosati's at least from our 2 experiences so far."}
{"text":"Experienced my first \"Chicago Deep Dish from Rosati's. 

After a night out on the strip This was a great quality place to experience. We ordered a medium size for three people and it was more than enough. Will definitely look forward to visiting this place again :)"}
{"text":"The service is terrible from the owner ED on down. 
The menu isn't updated online they told me they would honor a coupon for carry out then  turned around and said dine in only.
I will not eat at this rinky dink restaurant ever thanks to the run around I just went through."}
{"text":"Huge portions, food not bad, but not good.  Plan on splitting an entree.  Nice ambience though!"}
{"text":"I ordered food online and it charged my card and when I got there the business was closed. I still haven't been able to get a hold of rosatis for a refund. Please help!"}
{"text":"As a transplant from Chicago, one of the most difficult adjustments to Madison life has been the lack of quality pizza.  It boggles my mind that we are in such a vast wasteland when it comes to pizza!  And to find a dine in pizza place with decent offering is even more difficult.  I grew up on thin crust Chicago style. Rosati ' s has the best I've come across in my search for a taste of home. They use cheese that tastes like cheese., and Chicago style Italian sausage.  I do recommend ordering the thin \"double crust\" as the standard is too thin and cracker - like. 

Atmosphere is okay.  I wish I didn't have to listen to continuous Frank Sinatra every time for the entire duration of the meal.

Customer service was minimal.  I'm not one to expect the server to carry on long conversation.  But when they ask how we're enjoying the meal, it would be nice if they, at least, pretended as if they were listening /cared. 

Value is about what I expect for a dine in pizza.  Sixteen inch double crust sausage and bacon (we always get more than necessary to have leftovers.) Was about  $21.

Definitely a favorite when our stomachs are missing home. (I would give 3.5 stars of Yelp allowed.)"}
{"text":"My second time there and still didn't like it. Do not order eggplant parmesan unless you like overcooked/ burn burned  eggplants on top of plain pasta.  The salad was also not impressive for$10. Overpriced for the quality of food that we got. Asked for a refund. The only good thing about the place is the lady that works there. She was extremely nice and apologetic!"}
{"text":"New Owners!! Jeanie was super nice over the phone and our lunch was quite delicious - we had the cheese ravioli with meat sauce (large) the size was enough for three or four to eat a good portion.  The garlic toast was a little dry but otherwise the rest was great.  SO glad they are back and they deliver which works well for us as we are always crazy busy!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE DO NOT ORDER. If I could give zero stars I would. We ordered delivery at 8:15p (website says they deliver until 10) and we got a phone call saying their driver had already left and \"wouldn't be delivering any more tonight.\" We could come get it for $3 off, or they would cancel our order. I asked if anything else would be done to accommodate our order and the girl was very rude and refused to do a thing. Total laziness because the employees wanted to close early."}
{"text":"Ordered at 7:15..pizza came at 9:10.  Wasn't hot any more obviously.  One of the pies was wrong.  Cool."}
{"text":"We love this place! They have great salads and pizza. We can take our toddler and the staff is really friendly with him. My husband says it feels like we're eating at home when we go there."}
{"text":"I've never had much luck with this location.  Slow.  Frequently wrong order. At times downright rude, or at least clueless when dealing with customers.

I was overjoyed to see a sign out indicating they had new ownership, so I gave it another try.

Pizza by the slice should be warmer than room temperature. Maybe it's the location that's cursed?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we gave this crap hole another chance. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! The pizza sucked. Can't wait until they go out of business."}
{"text":"The Chicago style pizza was very good and the interior beer was awesome

The cheef sandwich was also very good as well as the baked pene."}
{"text":"We go here alot, close to home, good food, great service.  The bar is very small.  Love the pizza, really love the chicago style stuffed pizza.  Love the pasta.  But this time I tried something different.  Meatball sandwich.  OMG soooo good.  I could not eat the whole thing but it is going to be great leftovers.  My husband got the grinder sandwich, he has had many times and loves it everytime.
We always sit in the bar area and service is always outstanding."}
{"text":"More than just  Pizza. This location is small but cozy.  Has two large screen TV's for your entertainment pleasure.

The pizza is of better quality than most (a definate step up from Pizza Hut and Domino').  The thin crust is we like here.  The crust has a crunch to it, which I prefer.  Their menu has a \"tailgate\" variety of food (Pasta, Ribs, Fried Chicken, sub sandwiches......you get the picture).

The prices are bit high for what you get.  They do have specials so that is what our family typically goes for..... Familiy Feast ($22) includes 16' pizza with one topping, 6 wings, 4 garlic sticks, and 2 liter of pop.

We are planning to keep this place on our list of places to think about  for a weekday \"too many kid activities\" and \"too tired to cook\" take out night."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and when I first moved to AZ only Scottsdale had a location but I would drive anyway. When I moved to Chandler I was excited to find a sit down Rosatis. My thin crust, Italian sausage cravings were quelled!! They have any variety from thin to deep dish plus Italian beef sandwiches  Staff are always wonderful and last night was the best example. Monsoon season isn't complete without a little chaos and last night the power went out for 1000 homes plus the entire block of shops. We had a beer, the pizza had already been ordered and we were finishing up our appetizers when they lost power. Everyone stayed upbeat and cheerful, another round of beer came out and we waited. Pizza finally came out and our server out a glow stick in a cup for us with a smile and brought out ice tea as the backup generator went out also. Never once did anyone lose their cool as they finished up with the few tables left so they could close up shop. 8 pm on a Friday night! Even with that loss of revenue they were laughing and doing the best they could. Our food and service was still amazing despite Mother Nature trying to take out date night. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Have been out here in Phoenix 6years....we had been loyal Rosati fans in Chicago!. Just ordered pizza from Valerio G at this Rosati's location...she totally screwed up our order...and when I called to complain she had NO customer service skills what so ever. She was actually arguing with me as far as the order I placed.....amazingly bad....will never go back to them because of this obnoxious employee........BEWARE!!! Try Oreganos...it is much better....and so is the service!!!"}
{"text":"We placed an order through door dash and it gave us about an hour delivery time (10:15), which is fine.  There was a thing that showed us where the restaurant was in the delivery process i.e. Preparing, out for delivery etc.   At around 10:20 we called and they apologized and said they were busy and they \"didn't know\" when we should expect our food.  As I'm writing this review, it's 10:35 and we still haven't received our food.   I enjoy the pizza here, I just don't think I'm gonna try delivery again.  Dine in only from here on out.  It's a shame, I recommended this place and everybody else wanted Venezias.  Now their first Rosatis experience is a negative one."}
{"text":"Got the stuffed crust pizza for me and my kids. It was delivered fast, hot and fresh. My kids thoroughly enjoyed the pizza and 2 happy bellies equals 1 happy daddy. I will definitely order from them again. -1 star because I ordered pepperoni and only got cheese."}
{"text":"Previously:  We keep coming back because the food is good and it is close to home, but service is consistently slow.  For example, it's one hour later from arrival time and we have gotten side salads, but our appetizer wings have not shown up.  We often have to ask for a server.  Tonight I had to go get my own menu and ask for a server after 15 minutes.  If you're local and hanging out, it might be worth the bad service.  If you're considering stopping in, possibly reconsider.

UPDATE: Service has improved in recent visits & the manager reached out regarding my previous review above.  I really appreciated that and the fact that they have improved their service in response. Star rating has been updated. :)"}
{"text":"We considered this location for a business lunch, it would be perfect but it's too far west for the majority of our attendees. The food and service on this and a subsequent lunch we're both superb. I would love to come back more often, it's a little far from my home but it's an option for a special weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Asked for deep dish, got double dough. Very disappointing. Sucks when you order something expecting one thing but receiving something completely different instead."}
{"text":"BEST pizza in town...HANDS down.....service...A+...beer/spirits...A+  food quality....A+....as a Milwaukee native I'm very fussy about quality pizza, and Rosati's has never let me down..."}
{"text":"The food was average and just a tad over priced. The one Star is because of service. No food is going to taste good when you are receiving bad service. Groupon users beware!!!  When I walked in I let the girl know I'm using a groupon. She was really nice and asked me to have a seat in the dining room. The server came over and wasn't very friendly. I also let her know I had a groupon. I asked her about the daily special then decided on that. I then asked her if she wanted the groupon now or later. She said later. Fast forward through my meal and her bad attitude.... The bill came. I was charged separately for every item of the special. I asked why and she said I can't use the groupon with the special of the day. I told her if you would have told me that ahead of time I would have ordered differently. She stared at me blankly until she walked away. I went to the front and paid the nice cashier and after paying asked to talk the manager. The manager was worse than the server. She said the groupon states that you cannot combine offers. I told her it would have been nice to just have a heads up. I always talk respectfully to people being that I'm in the service industry myself but apparently she took that kindness for weakness and proceeded to tell me how it my fault for not reading the fine print. I just left it with says just a heads up would be nice and maybe a half a smile and a hello from the server instead of a what do you want attitude. Needless to say I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"What's with complaining about the price? You don't buy a Ferrari and complain about how much it cost. If it's too expensive for your blood, don't buy it. 

The pizza is awesome. I'm not from Chicago, or New York, or Philly, or any of that... so I guess I'm not an \"expert,\" but I think it's good food. Rosati's is way, way better than Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Dominos or any of those."}
{"text":"So, the first time we went there we tried there pizza. Nobody in the house enjoyed it. Tonight decided to give them another try. We decided we would then try there subs, since the pizza wasn't any good. So placed an order for pick-up. Ordered 3, received a bag that was stapled together. Got home and there were only 2 subs in there, had to go back after getting home. Got back home and none made the way we requested. Won't give them a 3rd chance, I'd suggest save your money and go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza... either thin or deep dish.... best Chicago style delivery you can get in The Tempe area(that I know of anyway).... the classic combo is great.... so is the monster if you have the appetite for it.... sometimes their customer service over the phone can be a bit.... lacking.... but the food is usually worth it....I do wish they'd add shrimp as a topping option.... you can always get shrimp as a topping at the good pizza joints in Chi...."}
{"text":"Ordered fried pickles. It took 35 minutes and cost $6.50 What I received were 6 well done disks. I called the store, and while talking to the girl in the phone, she answered another call - while I was in mid sentence! I could do nothing but laugh at the situation. Won't order here again."}
{"text":"I was a return customer at this location for a while. However a recent experience has changed that. I received a coupon for a free small cheese pizza with a purchase of $15 or more for my birthday. I called in my order and the first girl I spoke to clearly had no idea what she was doing because she handed off the phone to someone else without telling me to hold or even saying anything. The second girl I spoke to was talking to me like I was an idiot then proceeded to tell me that I was not a rewards member (even though I have signed up, the coupon was emailed to me and had my name printed on it), she had never heard of the promotion and kept asking more questions. So I simply asked if I could use the coupon or not hoping to get a direct answer and end this call. That is not what I got. She put in my order for two calzones and not the pizza until I came in to actually show her the coupon. When I got there she told me the coupon was for another location and they didn't do that. She did offer me a \"free birthday cannoli\" because apparently that is what this location does so the extra star is for that. Aside from that she could've handled the situation much better and saved some aggravation. Instead she wasted my time by making come down there knowing that they don't take that coupon and now I was stuck paying $23 for two calzones that I wouldn't have bothered ordering if I knew it wouldn't be honored. My main issue is with the company itself for sending me a coupon to a location that I have never been to before, never signed up at and is at the opposite end of town from me. Coupons for the company should be accepted at all locations and if they are not then that should be CLEARLY STATED on the coupon, which it was not. I'm big on customer service and needless to say after this, I will not be returning to this or any other Rosati's location."}
{"text":"On my quest to find a better pizza this was another one of my stops, and after many word of mouth reviews I checked it out.

We ordered a \"double crust\" (wich is a crispy hand tossed style) and mild wings.

Nothing much here, I didn't like how the pizza was cut into squares, (and didn't know or I would have asked for regular slices) and the cheese didn't seem right, the topping felt and tasted raw, it just didn't impress. Wings were a little better then ok but not good either.

Even though it was ok, I don't see the hype and won't be going back."}
{"text":"By far the best Rosati's in the valley!! Delivery is quick, everyone employee I've interacted with has been 
Friendly and helpful and the food is great! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I think the deep dish cheese pizza was very good.  I think I might lean towards delivery from this location.  There are coupons online on their website."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located right behind my sister's place. Craving Alfredo tonight and decided to make it easy and get some Togo. 

Ordering online-super convenient  love when they have that as an option.

The young lady in the front when picking up was friendly and my order was ready at the time they told me.

Chicken Alfredo- exactly what you expect and I have to say I did enjoy the garlic bread they include. Very tasty. Cheesy? 

Lasagna- I didn't personally try this, my sister typically orders it though and likes it alot. 

Fried mushrooms- ommggg yummmy I am just in general in love with fried mushrooms- with ranch. In the south it's a big thing and I don't see it often enough on the west coast. 

Cannoilis-best I ever had. Personal preference, but the way they make them, is what I like :)

Will be back"}
{"text":"Good pizza, great service. Delivered the wrong pizza. I gave them a call, wasn't a jerk and neither were they. Came back out with the right order in less than 15 minutes. Let me keep the first order. Score!

Good thin crust. Also surprisingly decent burgers. If you feel like gorging, their Chicago style will leave you feeling bloated and lethargic (like a good pizza should).

They use frozen spinach, not that I'm complaining. Just a heads up.

Most, if not all, pizzas come with a shake of Italian seasoning on top. Yum!"}
{"text":"gave me yuck mouth..  the pizza was under cooked and the fried zucchini was over cooked more like burnt wish i could add the pic this was such an disappointment definitely a waste of my money never again will i order here an never again would i recommend anyone to eat here..i  if u do pick it up yourself look at it before u pay..  obviously they don't care as much when they deliver to u definitely wish i could get my money back for this trash"}
{"text":"I'm from NY... who ever tries to compare NY to Chicago style pizza to decide which one is better is nuts!! There is just no way to compare the two! Two completely different animals and as much as I love NY style, I also love Chicago style!! 

This pizza is awesome! I always get a large stuffed crust with meatball (or hamburger as they would like to say... essentially some chopped meat). INSANELY delicious!

I've also has their chicken parm dinner and past and meatball dinners.... both AWESOME!!! Great fries and cheese sticks! I love you Rosati's of Glendale!"}
{"text":"Food is great - well other than their wings which pretty much are fried chicken drowning in sauce.

We ordered two weeks ago using their online ordering system.  Order came all screwed up - e-mail receipt did not match the printed one at all.  Complained and GrubHub (the delivery service) gave us a $20 credit.  The food was good and I've eaten in other stores before so we tried again tonight... and where do I start?

Here I guess!  Ordered online.  Got e-mail receipt including delivery time and our creidt.  I paid via credit card for the rest and included the tip.  Half hour after the estimated time (they're 1.2 miles from us) later the driver showed up.  He was very nice and very professional so he was the only positive about this experience.  He asked for the entire amount, sans credit, in cash.  We were puzzled but he showed no credit.  He got his phone out and called the store manager and let my husband talk to him.

At that point we got told that $20 credit was a store credit only - which baffles me as I had to click to apply the dang thing on GrubHub - and we could only use ordering directly.  He did at least finally let us pay via credit card, and I still feel bad we had no cash to tip the driver as we'd put the tip on the original credit card payment that never showed up.

So... if you want to eat in, I guess they're great and at least our order was mostly correct this time -although I am still utterly baffled why when I specicially ask any pizza place in this state for red peppers and cheese why they can't deliver those - but we will never use/order from Rosati's and/or their GrubHub counterpart again."}
{"text":"I love a good NY type pizza.. & I may just be a pizza snob., so upon moving to PHX , my friend ordered this in a pinch for caloric intake bc it was near our hotel..I've loved Rosatis ever since... I'd love for them to add some more variety to the salad selections.. But hey.. I'll take the awesome pizza & make my own salad..."}
{"text":"Great pizza on this side of town. I've eaten here and have had food delivered; the customer service is consistent and is much appreciated by me. The food is pretty good and the prices are on point. I've tried a few different items on the menu and so far I have not been disappointed- keep up the good work guys/gals! Now back to my wings, pizza and cajun fries!"}
{"text":"Worst service known to man. An order that was supposed to be ready in one hour took over one hour forty five minutes.  The hostess has disappeared from the front reception area for 15 minutes.  Amazing this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Excellent deep dish and excellent service.   Very friendly staff that makes you feel at home..the boys really enjoyed this place"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly.

The Italian Beef sandwich was huge.  Can't fit your mouth around it there is so much beef stuffed inside the white hoagie roll.  Served with greasy drippings to dip it in. Less than $8 and enough for 2 people to share.  Really enjoyed it.

My daughter ordered a pasta off the kids menu.  She was disappointed that it was just a tube pasta with a spicy sauce."}
{"text":"I would agree with the other posters, this Rosati's will leave you very disappointed.  I arrived in Scottsale forf a week. The first night I was excited to see Rosati's because I am from Chicago and love the pizza their.  Anyway, i got a salad and a pizza.  The salad was ok, but got ranch dressing despite ordering French.  Chicago style pizze was like cardboard.  Ended up throwing 3/4 of it away.  

Next night I called the other number for Rosati's.  Ordered a salad and pizza again.  Once again they sent Ranch with the salad when French was ordered.  Pizza was again horrible.

Do not order from here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!
Excellent Service!
Excellent Prices!
Fast and Fresh!
Gobbled it up so fast,,,no time to take a pic...sorry
You will have to trust me on this one"}
{"text":"I see a lot of poor reviews for this Rosatis location, but I've always had pleasant experiences. Yes, the place can use a good cleaning and some updates, but compared to similar carry out style places back in Chicago it's tolerable. I've always had decent customer service.

The pizza is really good. My favorite is he stuffed, but I typically get the thin crust (unless I'm really hungry). My whole family loves the pasta dishes, and we frequently get the fried chicken dinners too.

For a neighborhood carry out joint, the food is great and the prices are reasonable. This Rosatis location is in our regular dinner rotation and have yet to have an unpleasant experience. If you're really hungry the stuffed pizza is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Most of my reviews are equally weighted when it comes to food, customer service, and location; however, THE FOOD alone gives this 5 stars. 

Food: the marinara sauce that came with the mozzarella sticks and deep dish pizza was the best I've ever had. The food was just amazing. Pizza was $25 and it fed us that dinner, and two meals the next day. It was just amazing. Food is easily 5 stars and it is SOOO good it allows all to boost to a 5 star too! 

Customer service: it was very average. Nothing special, but overall it was good. 

Great place! I beg you to please try it out!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza. Got a deep dish of buffalo chicken but it was prepared with tomato sauce. Still was pretty good. They'll make pretty much anything regardless of if its on the menu."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here but it won't be the last. We got the Hawaiian thin crust pizza and it was awesome. Real cheese and quality ingredients made for a very tasty pizza. I wasn't expecting it to be so good based on previous reviews. Delivery time was reasonable and the driver was really nice."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried shrimp. The fries were cold and dripping with grease. The shrimp was okay but tasted a little off. The coke slaw was actually the best thing I received. My husband got a calzone and the bacon was close to raw and it was overcooked."}
{"text":"I've had many carry out dinners from Rosati's and man, are they good! I always know what I order will be cooked perfectly and taste delicious. One of my personal favorites is the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, for only $5.99 you get an amazingly large sandwich that will fill you up. I usually add au jus for only $0.25 more. Funny thing, I've yet to try their pizza's (I'm usually just grabbing someone on the go) but I am certain, and have confidence, that it will be just as delicious as their other menu items, if not better!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza for take out.  It was ready sooner than I was quoted.  The employee was very helpful and friendly.  I almost fell over when he handed me my pizza box.  It is so HEAVY.  I have never had a pizza like that.  The cheese tastes fresh and like a high quality mozzarella.  I will order from here again."}
{"text":"I had an issue with my pizza that took a few attempts to remedy, but was finally resolved when I walked in to return the pizza. I was satisfied with the resolution."}
{"text":"The food is fairly decent here, and it's pretty much the only restaurant within 5 miles of its location.  Their grinders and sandwiches are good, the salads are not so great, and the pizza is average/above average.  The reason this place doesn't get another star is the price.  You may do a double take when you see how much they charge for what you get. $10 for a tiny side salad you can get for a buck at Wendys.  Pizzas are $25+ (for a large), and 6 inch sandwiches are roughly 10 bucks.  I know the rent in this area is high, so maybe it's not the fault of the restaurant that they charge so much, but as a value-driven consumer, I find it really hard to bite the bullet and eat here."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place. Good pizza in Las Vegas is hard to come by and decent service where you get basic respect for paying for a pizza is even more rare in this town so I tried and tried. We have ordered from here around 10 times. The 1st time I ordered from this place I got the double dough crust and its great. Tried another time and they messed up and gave me the cracker thin crust instead which sucks, its not thin crust, it is literally a very crunchy super thin half burned cracker, a ritz is thicker and more buttery than this. So I just gave them the benefit of the doubt and let it go. Well, tonight it happened again and this time the woman has major attitude, gave me the 3rd degree about making sure my pizza is untouched for pick up when they bring out the correct order and said it will be over an hour since the driver has other deliveries. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THESE RUDE GHETTO PEOPLE AGAIN. Wake up Rosatti's, you are one of many choices in my zip code alone and your overpriced to boot. Good look and good riddance."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to use a $30 groupon....  Order some mozz sticks, garlic cheese bread and Chicago deep dish pizza...  The girl said it would be 25-30 minutes since it was a deep dish....ok....so we sat outside to wait....parked RIGHT IN FRONT of the window, so we could see the cashiers, they could see us.....after about 40 minutes, we moved from the patio table to the vehicle.....  My friend saw them stuff some bags in to the little warming oven....kept saying it was likely our food....I said: no way, we're sitting right here, they would have waved or something.... Boom.  Both the girls disappeared for about 15 minutes...  When they reappear I go in to ask....as I get in front of the counter, she turns, pulls my food out of the warmer.  Disappointed at their lack of communication, I take the food I have waited 55 minutes for and leave.  We get home....the cheese sticks were good, nothing great, but not bad.  Same goes for the garlic cheese bread.  The pizza was worth the wait.  Excellent.  However I felt the customer service was extremely lacking.....so I won't be back.  Sorry, but if the wait is TWICE as long as predicted, then when the food is ready the employees don't communicate that, then leave their \"station\".....not impressed."}
{"text":"My husband has been ordering from Rosati's on 59th Ave. since we moved into this house 5 yrs ago.  I read the Yelp reviews on Yelp and could not believe the amount of people who are having the same issues we have. It seems every time my Husband (not me) orders, we get the same crappy service. It's ridiculous. Our pizza tonight came an hour and 15 minutes after the order was placed (we were told 30-45 min), and the pizza was very cold when it finally got here.  The cheese was sliding off the top and driver apologized and said \"lemme know if the pizza is ok......I had to slam on the brakes\", what???!!! So we called the store and spoke with a \"Manager\".  We get that , that can happen but did he bake the pizza in the car too?! 

Here's the kicker.......We live only a half mile away and it took them an hour and 15 minutes! My husband called to talk to a manager and he yelled and said \"sometimes the drivers drive too fast. We could walk there if we wanted! So we feel an hour and 15 minutes is a cop out. 

Not to mention their pizza has been really disgusting lately. Who puts toppings on the dough, that was undercooked, then puts the cheese over it? Ridiculous! The cheese kept sliding off. It was cold, grease was dripping off the whole thing and just plain disgusting! I would rather eat a frozen pizza. NEVER again! Will find another pizza place and put this one in the past. After reading all of these reviews, you would think management would listen and make some changes!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great and our order was perfect. Good food, ready on time and hot out of the oven. Salad was fresh. Could have used a little more salad dressing.   Haven't been here for a while but will put it on our rotation of take out food places."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at 3:30 for pickup at 4:30. Got there 11 minutes early thinking I would have to wait for it but it was ready.  Short ride home and the pizza was cold,  dry and burned.   How long did it sit in the warming oven, my guess is too long.   Worst pizza ever, threw most of it away."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with Chicago-styled pizza.. but whatever the case, I love the warm carby and cheesy feel of Rosati's pizza in my mouth. They give an unusually amount of cheese that I can feel my arteries clogging, but I'm not complaining! I think overall it deserves more credit than it's gotten! 

They seem to have a decent pasta entree menu too!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza at 6:15, told us it would be 45 minutes. Now two hours later and two phone calls later and 65.00$ down the drain and still no pizza at 8:20 were firing up our oven and making baked taquitos. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but expensive. ...small Chicago style for $15...filling for sure...not much service...pizza took 30 minutes but came out not very hot....no one came out to even see if i needed anything else......no beer served here....sodas came out in cans. No atmosphere. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Incredible!! Best pizza and I've ever, RVER!! Had, I'm not even a wings person but my husband is and they looked so good I had in indulge and glad I did,even the dips were amazing, so full...."}
{"text":"I gave Rosattis a second chance and they have redeemed themselves. They are worthy of having their pizza being called \"Chicago style\". My thin crust was baked to perfection and the staff there were polite and awesome. I guess the last time I was there must've been a fluke. So with all that being said if you're in the mood for authentic Chicago style pizza stop by Rosattis."}
{"text":"This place has no customer service, and does not prepare food at normal temperature that is approximate for consumption. The main entree was the issue, and they forget the salad, but sent the dressing with the delivery, Idiots. The entire place needs to be replace or closed."}
{"text":"Great sports bar! Tv's EVERYWHERE! The pizza is amazing but the wings not so much. We always sit at the bar and usually have great service. Prices are reasonable. If you live in old town it is definitely a great place to watch football."}
{"text":"I was not impressed...the chicken fettuccine alfredo was decent although I have had better or equivalent elsewhere so it was nothing to write home about. 

The garlic bread that is included was just plain gross...it was so hard and dry I tried to add butter to it and that didn't even help. It tasted like it was stale...so hard we just threw it into the trash. 

The other issue was the dough knots that I ordered...they didn't even bring them with my delivery and I had to call the store and they sent the driver back out with them. 

Strick one, bad garlic bread, strike two, forgot part of my order, strike three the manager responding when I called with \"they were missing from your order?\" Ummm, yes, what part of that did he misunderstand? At that point a refund of my $$ for that item would have been better than sending the delivery driver back with an hour old batch of dough knots...just my opinion, because at that point I didn't really want them."}
{"text":"Let me tell you the tale of \"Captain Save-a-Dough.\" A few years ago I went to this location and it was average. Flash forward to last night when my family ajd I has a Rosatti's feast that changed my viewpoint about the place. Turns out new owners came in about a year ago and cleaned house. Re-trained everyone, had corporate come in and verify all recipies... basically restored this location to perfection. I tried many of the menu items and was blown away. It was clear that much effort was recently poured into this place. The spaghetti & meatballs were A+, and that new thin crust hot-peppers-pizza was something special as well."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with the pepperoni deep dish and I was so happy. We used to live on Chicago and were huge fans of Giordano's so if that's your style go for it! I highly recommend for craving good deep dish! Cheese sauce dough ratio was spot on. ALSO- we got it delivered and it took maybe 20 minutes on a Saturday night and was hot. No complaints."}
{"text":"Great service and food-My wife likes the thin crust, give me the Cheef!"}
{"text":"Out here in the Phoenix area for some business and felt like a pizza and boy did I find a great one..first off the customer service over the phone was great the girl that took my order guided me through the menu and helped me make my order of a monster Chicago style with hot wings. .usually im a four to five slices guy but with the weight of this pizza im so full after only a slice and 3 huge wings..the ingredients were so good and fresh and the wings were huge and tasty..delivered on time in 45 mins...definitely a must stop spot if your in the area THANKS ROSATIS"}
{"text":"This is what we received when we ordered from Rosati's Pizza of Phoenix AZ on Thunderbird and I17.

#ChicagoDeepDish #TwoThumbsDown

#rosatispizza"}
{"text":"This truly is Chicago style pizza! If that's the kind of pizza you like, then you won't be disappointed. The price is very reasonable for a large thin crust. I ordered from them twice in the last two weeks and want another pie tonight! I had no problems with the customer service."}
{"text":"I find Rosati's inconsistent. They are always nice. But one day the pizza is perfect, the next it's barely mediocre. I will say there wings and other apps are great. They will always accommodate a family with fussy kids but aren't fast. I will keep giving them my business because they are close by and nice. But not my top choice for pizza."}
{"text":"Not sure why the low reviews. Pizza was great - so much better than Barro's. They also have a full bar."}
{"text":"I've been coming to today's for two years since I moved to Vegas.  Best place for wings and deep dish.  But was pleasantly surprised with ambiance of its new renevation and ownership.  The manager Jason took time to talk to us and different tables I noticed to welcome the new business. Gave us a sample of their delicious to die for dough nuggets.  Keep up the the great work and atmosphere.  Felt right at home.  Good music and sports watch.  Aww  just what a pizzeria should be.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited 15 minutes to just get drinks.  It felt like summer in there it was so hot.  The place has no background music and so you can hear everybody else's conversations.  I can see why they offer Groupons because who would come here otherwise.
The pizza tasted okay but the experience was altogether horrible."}
{"text":"Really good option if you're looking for Chicago style pizza in the desert!"}
{"text":"My pizza a soggy. There were have internet issues when I was there but I believed the oven was working"}
{"text":"I walked inside, ready to try this place out for the first time and was greeted by an empty counter. The tv in the lobby was up loud, so I'm guessing my attempts to make myself known weren't heard by the staff but I decided to wait anyway and look over the menu. About 5 minutes later someone came out to the counter and asked if he could help me. When I asked about ordering a slice (which was the special they had listed on the whiteboard on their counter) he told me they didn't have any. He made no attempt to apologize for me sitting in their dining room without being acknowledged for 5 minutes or the fact that they didn't have the product they advertised. It wasn't surprising to me that he made no attempt to keep my business when I left without ordering. Way to win over a new customer who lives in the neighborhood. Keep up the great customer service."}
{"text":"Was one of my favorite pizza places but after my recent order it's going to be hard for me to order again. I order over $45 worth of food and let's just say it was a waste of money. Pizza dough was hard and crunchy when I ordered the double dough, it was like day old pizza taste. the jumbo wings I got couldn't even eat them as the sauce was a thick cream paste like substance. I've always gotten good food from here but I'm very upset I wasted the money into the trash."}
{"text":"Food is always good, service is friendly. Their deep dish is awesome, however I love their thin crust, makes a nice change. Pizza Hut can learn lessons from these folks."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza and expensive. Not impressed at all. They took forever to deliver and it was double the cost of decent pizza. My dogs wouldn't eat it. Never again..."}
{"text":"Over priced fast food, French fries tasted like burnt grease, my daughters alfredo sauce was thin as water, my sons waffle fries were all stuck together in a huge clump. There were only about 5 tables occupied but it took almost an hour to get 2 burgers and fries , a hotshot sandwich, and an order of watery chicken alfredo.  65.00 for that and 3 cokes"}
{"text":"Stopped and grabbed a sandwich, wanted something different than subway tonight.....italian beef with cheese and hot peppers.....not bad!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best customer service ever!! And the food is above par and so fresh. I moved to a new complex and wanted to order a pizza. I took a piece of paper which I believed was my address to give to the really nice woman on the phone. She even offered a coupon to save some money. Well, the delivery driver was prompt and on time. He called to get some navigation and guess what? I gave the wrong address. I was about 4.5 miles away. He figured it out and came to me. He was so kind and courteous (I would've been annoyed and frustrated). I applaud my experience this evening due to the experience with both people I had contact with. If I could give more than five stars, I would. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This location is the best and all Rosati's are not created equal. The Godfather on thin crust and Meat Lover in deep dish with sauce on top are both incredible! They are the office favorite!"}
{"text":"So many mediocre reviews, but my takeout experience was great!

After work, I ordered a spinach pizza and a calzone (ricotta and pineappe) and my husband and I were beyond satisfied with the food!  I called in the order and was told 25 minutes.  It was ready in exactly 25 minutes, no wait, but no cold food either.

Their menu is a decent size so I anticipate we'll be ordering from them in the future, for sure."}
{"text":"Really good pizza although it's a little pricey. They use high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"So lets start off with the pizza.. I order myself a pepperoni slice (their slices are huge) & very thick (a little too thick) they rewarm the same pizza all day so depending how late you go, the pizza is pretty crunchy at this point. The cheese practically falls right off. 

I ordered fried pickles: I am not sure if they were not cooked all the way but the middle was mushy and unpleasant to eat. 

The wings: I ordered extra crispy and thats about the only thing I liked. Although the sauce was bland I could actually eat them. 

The drinks: it takes like 10 min. For a refill to go noticed even when there was only one other couple in while I was here.


The service: Wasnt terrible, but didnt stand out."}
{"text":"I tried Rosati's for the first time yesterday. They have a 1/2 OFF ON TUESDAYS deal so I thought why not? I was not expecting much, after all this is Champaign-Urbana! I must say though that I was pleasantly surprised.
I am a lover of thin crust and their Pepperoni Classic was very tasty. Mushrooms, gooey cheese, great crust,yummy sauce...what more do you need? 
Not bad at all for Champaign-Urbana! They are located on campus but it's summer now so it's completely void of college brats. Lovely!!"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizzas here are the best. We come here often.  I always think I'll try something else, but I love them so much that I always just get another thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Do not go to this location! Rosatis is typically very good but if you want to try this place go to another location. Staff is clueless with computer system. Takes forever to make pizza so they take your order (and your money) and then make you come back in 20-30 minutes later only to not have the order started yet. This was during a \"slow time\". They blamed it on \"computer error\" and were rude and unapologetic. Even gave girl taking my order $2 tip. You'd think with a tip she would at least make sure my order made it in. Terrible location!"}
{"text":"No no no! Nothing positive here! Dont even try it! Poor service poor atmosphere and the food perp presentation and taste is poor!"}
{"text":"OMG we almost didn't order from here because of the 3 star review but so glad we did it was amazing we ordered a deep dish, fried pickles, garlic cheese bread, and wings all was amazing and delicious!!! Definitely recommend trying!!!"}
{"text":"I love the rosati's by my old house, but this place was horrible! Had to wait an hour for my small order, which would have been fine (thought they had a busy night), but when I got there it was totally dead. Secondly the pizzas were way over baked and on my hawaiian pizza instead of bbq sauce they put regular tomato sauce which tasted completely unseasoned like it was plain sauce straight out of a can. Worst pizza ive had in a long time."}
{"text":"Ordered Italian beef. The meat had a green iridescent hue to it I returned it got my money back I will not go to this place again for anything not The Rosatis I remember from Chicago I would not of given it any stars if possible"}
{"text":"I want to let you know that a new owner just purchased the restaurant and has made tremendous improvements. Updated decor, more televisions, new staff, updated menu, higher standards and a bunch more specials! The food is better than ever before and you should definitely give this place a try again! Don't pay attention to past reviews. That's in the past, give it a chance!"}
{"text":"They have really went down hill on their service. I ordered a home delivery and I was told it will be 45 mins to an hour.  Exactly one hour later they called around the time the pizza supposed to be delivered. saying they messed up on the order and it will be another 20 mins. And they will take 15% off the bill. And she will call us to make sure the order made it. The delivery guy shows up nothing was took off the bill and she didn't call so we called her back. She got an attitude when we told her we wanted our discount. She said if we didn't sign for the charge ,for the delivery guy to bring order back. So the guy took the order back and I won't be dealing with their poor customer service again"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Got pizza, calzones, and jalape√±o poppers. All delicious. Cashier was friendly and had a great smile. Great job Rosatis at hualapai."}
{"text":"Sick of dominos so thought we'd try here since it's so close to home. Would be nice to have a delicious pizzeria close to home. Rosatis has definitely disappointed. Ordered a large ham and pineapple for pickup. Promptly made within about 20 minutes. None of the toppings stayed on the pizza when you pulled your piece away. Cheese is a horrid quality and the sauce had little flavor. I hope they don't make their dough either because it tastes stale and dried out. It would be embarrassing if someone actually made it like this on purpose. For the price, you'd think the quality would be higher. Quality and quality should go hand in hand."}
{"text":"Do not go here. I spent $11 on one slice of pizza and waited about 30 minutes just to see other people order things after me and get their before. I eventually just ended up leaving empty handed and eating at another restaurant. I just regret going there in the first place."}
{"text":"I ordered a Ceasar salad with chicken and Dough nuggets. For one I didn't get any dressing at all with my salad and two the dough nuggets are so plain and over priced for something that is just bread oregano and marinara sauce.... at least season them to taste."}
{"text":"I had a large thin crust sausage, mushroom and bacon pizza. It was absolutely delicious! One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. Highly recommend and I will be ordering from Rosati's a lot from now on! Well done Rosati's !"}
{"text":"I ordered the stuffed pizza with 2 toppings. It was the thinnest \"stuffed\" pizza I've ever seen. They neglected to put cheese in the pizza. And no spices in the globs of sauce on top. Worst pizza ever!! :("}
{"text":"Ate here with my sister and cousin while we were visiting from out of town and two of us ended up with food poisoning from the cheese ravioli with the meat sauce and the chicken alfredo. Do not eat here unless you want to get sick for three days and throw up five times a day. Terrible."}
{"text":"We passed on trying this place before because of some of the yelp reviews but my daughter really wanted to try it today so we gave it a shot! We were greeted right away and told to sit where ever.  The place was clean and had very cool atmosphere! Carrie was nice and got our order quick and efficiently!  The caeser salad was perfect for my daughter and I to split and the dressing was delicious! We ordered the Chicago style pizza with pepperoni and it did not disappoint! So glad my daughter talked us into giving this place a try! We are also within the delivery area so will try ordering delivery sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, prices are reasonable especially for the quality of the food, and the delivery wasn't bad at all. 

Did i mention that the food was phenomenal? You gotta get the meat balls. At 1 dollar each, they are like the secret menu item. Trust me order at least 2!!!"}
{"text":"We have had pizza delivered a few times, and we've loved everything we have tried. The 18\" pizza is huge and they are always quick on delivery."}
{"text":"I was so excited that I could get food delivered to me past 10pm! Waited an hour for pizza, spaghetti and wings. I asked the lady delivering my food if the spaghetti and wings were in the bag she handed me... She said yes. I would have checked it right then, but I had two dogs trying to get out of the door to greet a new person. As soon as I get inside, ready to go eat the spaghetti I had been craving for hours, I realize that there was only wings in the bag. I call the delivery person who tells me to call the store. I call the store and after speaking to the young lady on the phone she offered to give me a discount on my next purchase or to deliver the spaghetti tonight. Ummmmm... If I wasn't up writing this review I would already be in bed. I don't have another hour to wait for spaghetti. As I write this review I am waiting for the delivery person to bring me back the cash I paid for the \"spaghetti\". Mind you.. I called her as soon as I realized it wasn't included in my order 20 minutes ago."}
{"text":"I work at the barber shop couple stores down and we eat here 3-5 times a week and we never get sick of it. Good food and good service. One of the best pizza places I have ever eaten in."}
{"text":"I can't complain,

It's not my type of pizza but it was an all and all decent experience. Not over overwhelmingly friendly but also not rude. The pizza is what you'd expect from any of the chain Rosati's."}
{"text":"Ordered the double dough pizza for takeout. Got home, 3 of us had a taste, 3 of us hated it. It was dense and difficult to swallow. When we called back to see what they could do for us, we were told that the best they could do is half off our next order. (There wouldn't be another order if the food and service left a bad impression.) We were then told that they could remake it for us and we could get the standard thin crust, but when we were about to complete the order, they told us it be $13.00+!!! We canceled and I'm disappointed that I am now left with $25.00 worth of food that we aren't even going to touch. They must be crazy to expect that I'm going to pay more for something that wasn't pleasant to eat from the beginning."}
{"text":"Decided to do takeout last night - long day, and the Cowboys and Washington were on Thursday Night Football.  We ordered the Antipasto salad to share (Romaine & iceberg lettuce, spinach leaves, green pepper, red onion, black & green olives, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, grape tomato, Mozzarella cheese & shaved Asiago cheese) and paired that with their greek dressing. O M G ... it was wonderful - fresh, just the right combination of ingredients.  I'm already jonesing for another and it's 7:00am!  Their sandwiches are always huge, so this time, we split the Italian Beef and added hot peppers.  The bread was perfect - toasted - meat tasty, the peppers added the right zing and the Au Jus was great.  Another home run!  We added an order of mild wings and blue cheese.  Wow. Perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I've never been more pleased with a take out meal!  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"One of my two favorite pizza's in town. Cut in squares is true Chicago style and with real Chicago Italian sausage."}
{"text":"Great pizza, but prices are ridiculously high. We were regulars but our last experience will be our last. Placed a very large order which included chicken wings, about $80 of food and after waiting an hour to eat it gets delivered with no ranch or blue cheese for wings....I call and let them know and she acts like it's my fault somehow for not specifying even though I specifically asked delivery guy if ranch was in the bag and he said yes. So she then says she will send another guy out with ranch, annoying because now I have to wait longer but ok..... New delivery guy comes and guess what, he brings 3 small containers of BLUE CHEESE and not ranch! 3 small containers for 24 wings, besides the point...so I call back and advise them that they sent blue cheese and not ranch, she then proceeds to disagree and argue with me saying that she watched the guy put ranch in my bag... I told her I dipped my finger in each of the 3 containers and they were for sure chunky blue cheese, I know the difference. Then she asked me 2-3 more times if I was sure it was blue cheese, I finally said just forget about it and hung up I was already so frustrated. Not once did they say I'm sorry or offer a discount on a future order. To top things off, they send a 3rd guy out to bring me ranch and the guy delivers Parmesan cheese!!!!!! No ranch!! Epic fail!!! And still no offer of discounts, but he did apologize...... They are a joke!"}
{"text":"Their blind delivery driver is surprisingly prompt and almost always makes it to the door without dropping my pizza.  That being said, I am concerned for the safety of others on the road.

   The very nice guy from Russia made me the best cheeseburger, I think his name is Nikolai.

   The girl behind the bar most nights is fast, friendly and fun.  The young guy working isn't bad but is not nearly as exceptional as the red head."}
{"text":"I didn't like the food. I ordered on uber eats it came cold which I didn't mind. But on the site I listed details that were not accurate in my order I asked for extra ranch and we got 1. I was just unhappy then I was quoted a time and my food arrived almost an hour after the initial time quoted. It doesn't take an hour to cook a cheese pizza even from scratch because I've done it before. Will not be returning or ordering again. Flavors of the food was just alright. Wasn't bad wasn't anything special either. The ranch dipping sauce was the best tasting thing. The French fries were nasty. They had no flavor at all. Like frozen fries from Costco"}
{"text":"I usually get the Pepperoni Pizza and their Garlic Bread. The crust on the pizza is so nummy. One time when we ordered the pizza though it came back way over cooked. The Garlic Bread has a layer of melted cheese on top and it to die for. You also HAVE to get the giardiniera, sooooo gooooood!!!! You can buy a jar of it for you to have at home, so worth it!

When you walk in it has the feel of an Italian Pizza place. The only bad thing is they take FOREVER! I can call in an order and they'll say it'll be ready in 15-20 minutes, so I will get there in 30 and half the time it's not even done yet. I once waited almost an hour for my order and I was the only person inside waiting. 

They do and a new dining area complete with a bar. I haven't had the opportunity to check it out yet but if you want to sit down to eat it seems like it wouldn't be too shabby. Just make sure you order appetizers in case the pizza takes too long!"}
{"text":"First of all, I was referred to this restaurant by a friend, (now I have to question this). First of all, the online ordering system was not working so we had to call. Not a big deal, we ordered on a Saturday afternoon, so we expected to wait longer for delivery,The delivery guy was very  polite, and nicely groomed, which isn't really that common with delivery people so KUDOS to him. 
I ordered a vegetable pizza. Apparently green bell peppers are really cheap this time of year, because what I received was bell pepper, dough, tomato sauce, more bell peppers, and a couple small pieces of onion. The cheese was basically in the middle only. For the price they charged I was very disappointed.  
On the plus size, I like that it is cut in to the pieces like it is. I also liked the piece of plastic that the pizza sits on in the box, it keeps the box from getting greasy. Not very earth friendly, but what is a little bit of plastic among friends.
If the quality and taste of the pizza was good I would have not minded the price, but for a mediocre pizza....never again."}
{"text":"Whoa!!!! I was craving authentic Chicago style pizza and they nailed it. You know how sometimes because it's deep dish it's hard to get the crust right? They nailed it! And fresh ingredients. My mom is going to be mad I'm not flying back for pizza anymore"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza in the area. Top notch. The delivery is done within a timely matter and the deliciousness of the pizza is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Had a really great dinner here for valentines. The pizza was fantastic as usual but we decided to dine in this time for the holiday. We took my five year old out for her \"valentines date\". The place seems to be run by a family and they give really awesome service. It was busy but our waitress was on top of it and it never felt like we were in a busy place. There was a relaxing atmosphere that made dinner so enjoyable. So excited to have a new place right across the street. They even brought my daughter a cannoli, which she thought was the coolest thing ever. $4 for her own personal pizza was a bomb deal too! Their IPA was tasty and the salad. Really everything was just perfect."}
{"text":"I found them through i-dine
The Pizza was good
Service was bad
I ordered a thin crust  pizza
Was told it would be 15 Minutes
I walked next door to the 99 cent store and walked back and was told my Pizza wasn't even in the oven yet
They had a large order come in after me so they put that order to the Front of the line
It took over 4o minutes for my pizza
The woman who took my order apologized multiple times but it isn't her fault
Probably won't come back
All because of the service
What they should have done was offer me a free drink while I waited which would have been the smart thing to do"}
{"text":"The pizza and lasagne were horrible. The food ended up in the trash. Pizza was gross because the crust was wet and not crisp. The lasagne was a lump of cheese and the noodles were mush. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"My family is from Chicago and has ordered the thin crust many times from this location with no complaints. We decided to go \"full Chicago\" tonight and try the deep dish. I have to say it was the saddest excuse for deep dish I have ever encountered. The crust was cracker thin and crumbly, and there was only one extremely thin layer of cheese smothered in a ridiculous amount of tomatoes (with no flavor whatsoever). To say we were disappointed would be the biggest understatement of the year. We most likely will never go to this location again. In fact, why the heck would we when Lou Malnati's is here now?! Worst. Decision. Ever."}
{"text":"I just called to order pizza as i do almost weekly.  Lady says oh dang the computers are down maybe you can call back in like 10 minutes and i can take your order.  Nope i will call somewhere else!  For the future customers maybe you can take the order on a piece of paper, get the pizza cooking and when the computers come back up you could enter in the order at that point......you would still have a customer"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza best I ever had the staff was very helpful with letting me know was popular in the neighborhood I was told go with the meat mania best pizza ever"}
{"text":"I am from chicago and love rosatis only reason i am giving a 5 star i placed an order with them couple nights ago took a pizza i thought was mine but it was not i had ordered a thin crust half pepperoni half sausage when i got home i realized i had over paid and got a double dough meat lovers i was just so hungry i grabbed paid and left in the end i dumped pizza in trash a went to julio bertos took a 25 dollar hit so prolly last time i will order there until i get back to chicago"}
{"text":"Try calling them three times and each time is on hold for over five minutes each time I like their food but they don't know how I answer the phone so I guess I'll eat somewhere else!
Just a big zero!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Monster pizza a 28.00 dollar pizza and what I received was left over pizza , no ingredients burn It look like leftovers from other people's pizza. Who ever is the cook poor workmanship. Sorry they lost a good customer. It's not even worth ordering or visiting this place againHad to throw pizza at the garbage it was not presentable or edible ."}
{"text":"This place is all right.
It's close enough to my house that I order from it.

I'm a fan of Chicago style thin crust and they do good by it. That's all, nothing impressive.

Their wings and side items are decent too.

One thing this place is not is:
\"Best pizza in phoenix to date\"
Do not believe this.  Also, the double dough is not good.  As thin crust it's good, but when you double it up, you can taste the dough more and a floury lack of yeast/rise time flavor comes through... I make better crust at home honest.

Also one thing this place is not is bad.
It's decent and with their coupons it makes an easy delivery option that won't leave you hanging.

I have yet to try their deep dish, but judging by the double dough and phoenix's track record with deep dish, I'm not compelled to venture in that direction.

I'll stick with my lazy night option: thin crust and wings."}
{"text":"Second best deep dish pizza in the valley (after LuoMalnati's). I love the tomatoes on top of the pizza. It has plenty of cheese and excellent flavor. Can't wait to order it again!"}
{"text":"Rosatis is from Chicago, not New York.  It's good but not great Chicago style square-cut pie.  Overall, if your in a hurry and see Rosatis it's a step above Papa John's or Domino's but definitely not in the same league as Settebello or Ciao Ciao."}
{"text":"The Food was delivered in a timely fashion and was Great and very Filling.
Topped off with Tiramisu!

My Family and I will be ordering from them again!

Go Steelers!"}
{"text":"This was bad pizza. I ordered a large pan pizza with a Greek salad last night for delivery to my hotel. I ate one piece and had a terrible taste of yeast or something in my mouth. The dough was the heaviest or densest dough of any kind I have ever had. The pizza must have weighed 10 pounds and was 90% dough. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce. Two hours later my wife arrived and I told her not to eat it and throw it all out. That was a $35 pile of yuk. I had a belly ache and diarrhea all night and half a day."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. The atmosphere is tense feeling, yelling among employees and manager. The only thing good is the pizza. I sure hope no one else goes to enjoy a family dinner here to have to listen to all the negativity. 

The rate the new management is going this place which has been around for a long time will be closed due to no business. No one wants to hear yelling while trying to have a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Mesa! I am from Kenosha, WI where there is an authentic Italian restaurant practically on every corner. When we moved to Mesa in 1995, the thing my hubby and I missed the most was the pizza! When Rosati's opened we had to try and their thin crust is just like home in WI. Also, every Christmas Eve we get Rosati's catered for our family party and this years food was the best ever! We got chicken, Italian beef sandwiches, mastacholi (sp), salad and garlic bread. The price is right and I didn't have to spend all day cooking and got to spend it with my family, who all raved about the food. I highly recommend ordering from here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really wanting deep dish pizza... I had never had Rosati's and my husband hadn't had it in years! We were really happy that this location was able to deliver to our house! A longer estimated time for delivery was to be expected since we got deep dish, but our pizza arrived ahead of schedule!

We got one deep dish and one thin crust (clearly our eyes were bigger than our stomachs) but both were so delicious, we were happy for the amazing left-overs for lunch and dinner the next day!

Also, the man who delivered our pizza was incredibly kind. It sounds like he and his wife really put a lot of love into this place and I truly believe that showed from the ease of ordering all the way to the last piece of crust. We will be happy to order here again!"}
{"text":"They just sold this place now they don't know how to make pizza. Somebody let me know when they are making good pies again so I can go back to my beloved rosatis"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 1995 , when I first moved to Las Vegas. I love the deep dish Chicago pizza . Just picked up a deep dish Chicago pizza and it was delicious !  Tim the new Kitchen manager  has  maintained the famous Rosati's sauce and crust  and  after  coming here for now unbelievable 19 years it's comfort food at its best ."}
{"text":"We ate a pie in the store, and it kicked ass, and the staff was friendly.       Good experience, great pie.       Took a while to cook but we ordered a stuffed pie so naturally it was going to take a while.    WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in this area. I've tried a lot of pizza places here in North Las Vegas, and this is the best."}
{"text":"The food is good. Get the garlic nuggets. Amazing.  But delivery is slow. They say 45-60 min. But give it 90. They never deliver on time. EVER."}
{"text":"Decided to try it since it is very close to my house.  The toppings were good but they put too much sauce on it.  We got the thin crust and there was nothing special about it.  Will try some place else next time I want pizza."}
{"text":"Total delivery fail.  I'm stuck at home doing work today and can't leave.  I ordered a salad online and was told 45 - 60 minutes.  Fair enough.  An hour and twenty minutes later I call, spend 6 minutes on the phone, and learn that the salad is ready and will be going out soon.  No explanation.  It's still not here.  When the result is waiting 1 1/2 hours for a salad when 60 minutes was the outer end of the delivery time, maybe no explanation would do.

Update: Arrived one hour later than the latest possible time I was quoted at the time of order.  There was no chicken in my chicken caesar salad.  2 hours to move a salad 2 miles and then to get it wrong; this is why Yelp exists."}
{"text":"Most horrible customer service! Deliveries always lateZ food always cold. Manager refused to give discount or free pizza after delivering pizza lat and cold twice in a row."}
{"text":"IS THIS PLACE FOR REAL?!!!!  WOW!!  
The hubby and I wanted to stay in and order some takeout so we tried something new. We ordered online and within 30 minutes this amazing dinner showed up at our door with the most enthusiastic guy super happy to be delivering our food to us!!!   We opened up the bags and couldn't believe our eyes!!!  The very best service and food we have had in a very long time!!!  I highly recommend you try it tonight!!!  Thank you for the great dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a phony Rosati's Pizza. Not like other very good locations.  Order a Chicago deep dish pizza when I got in home 10 minutes the box was completely soaked wet and the bottom of the pizza was just drenched in liquid and mush.  Had no flavor as far as a good deep dish crust. They used a low quality cheese and the sausage had miniscule little pieces not clumps of quality sausage. Worst Pizza we had in over 20 years."}
{"text":"Rosati's is a Chicagoland staple. I used to order from Rosati's about every week around the mid 80's until they went downhill. Twenty years later I find out that the owner's from the Rosati's I used to patronize moved to Arizona. Ok - that explains everything.

We ordered a couple of large pizzas for delivery yesterday when we had some friends over. We ordered a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper which was delicious and a half pepperoni and half vegetarian which I was told was excellent. They even delivered on time, we asked for a 6pm delivery and they delivered. Best pizza in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"I love pizza and I'm partial to the thin crust pizza. Their thin crust pizza is excellent. It's cut into squares (Chicago Style) instead of slices. It makes eating the pizza much easier and it allows the crust lovers to only eat the pieces around the edge. I think their ingredients are fresh and of good quality.

So why only four stars? That's because their deep dish pizza has too much sauce and really didn't taste too good fresh out of the oven. The pizza really improves when it's heated up the next day.

This is a take out location on the north side of Shea Rd near Mountainside Fitness."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing...I got the monster pizza.. anyone with a appetite this is the way to go.. Thank you Rosati's.. I have had a lot of pizza this  place is by far my favorite.. awesome staff quick delivery. No other place like this one."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered a chicken Caesar salad with cheesy garlic bread and fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken. The salad was good even the next day. The Alfredo was delicious and the portion size is enough for 2 maybe 3 meals. The bad....the cheesy garlic bread was just ok..I would not order it again.

Tonight 9/24 I ordered mozzarella sticks, which tasted like an inexpensive frozen brand from your local market....will not order again. I also ordered penne & grilled chicken a la vodka, which was just as delicious as the Alfredo that I had ordered last week. Again the portion is enough for 2 or 3 meals.

I finally figured out an appetizer that is perfect for me....the fried zucchini....yummy. My go to order is the fried zucchini with either the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken or the grilled chicken a vodka. Always delish and always hot (delivery)!!!!

10/22 - I have to change my rating of a 4 to a 3 . As I previously stated I order the same thing every time - with that being said this is the 3rd time I ordered penne & grilled chicken a la vodka - on line when you order that prompts you to choose a size regular or family size. The problem is that when you choose regular - the ticket that they receive at the restaurant comes thru as regular pasta. Now the first time I ordered this, a girl called to clarify. The 2nd time, I didn't receive a call, but I did receive the correct pasta. Today I didn't get a call and I got just plain pasta.  I'm not happy at all, I immediately call and explain the situation..the girl on the phone doesn't seem to care about their mistake, it's their website that produces the wrong ticket. I was like well I need to talk to your manager. She comes back stating here manager is busy but she can give me credit for my next order or I can have a new order for the correct food sent out. Ummmm, I want my food. She's says they are working on updating the website, but clearly it's NOT fixed....lesson to myself if I even order again is to call the order in!!! Let's see what happens when my food gets here....to be continued! My food was delivered hot and correct!!!! So maybe I will give them back the 4 stars and just NOT order online anymore!!!!"}
{"text":"Mobster movie night.. Ordered from the Yelp Eat24 app and delivery was prompt. Hubby said the driver seemed like a nice country guy (lol he'd know). He tipped him 20% for being prompt and friendly. 

Side Salads with Ranch Dressing were good. Lettuce, red onions and cherry tomatoes were fresh and crunchy. Ranch was perfect. Garlic Bread with Cheese was yummy. Really good Fettuccini Alfredo. Perfect sauce, but they missed the 'add on' Grilled Chicken we requested (I typed it in the special instruction box... just double checked and it's on my email confirmation) No biggie for us because my Chicken Parmigiana entree was such a nice size with lots of melted cheese so I gave hubby half of my chicken to add to his Fettuccini Alfredo :) He was happy. Ordered the cheesecake but will have to nibble on that later. I'm sure it'll be really good seeing how everything else was fresh and flavorful. It's smaller than the pic on the app but we don't need to be eating a huge dessert after all of that rich, delicious pasta and bread :) We'll be ordering in from here again."}
{"text":"Rosatis has pretty good Chicago-style thin crust pizza. I scored them a 3, because the last couple of times my giant pizza was a bit burned."}
{"text":"First time coming here;  and I was really AMAZED by the quality of food, quickness of service, and decent pricing!

I ordered a nice sausage/italian beef sandwich; got a side of marinara and some au jus sauce... and the lady got a eggplant parm with spaghetti and a side salad.

Her food was a huge portion; and looked pretty damn delicious.   My sandwich, and I kid you not, was a huge, monstrous carnivores dream!  The marinara is some of the tastiest sauce I've had in a long time as well.  This sandwich was impossible to finish;  the sausage specifically was amazing. 

Im not in vicinity to this location usually, so Im gonna try the tempe location soon; probably for pizza as thats a good barometer as to quality of food.  But its not easy making a good sandwich like the one I had, it was obviously fresh ingredients and someone back in that kitchen knows what the heck they are doing.  

Fit for a king, budgeted for a peasant.  Im down with that!!!  Rosatis' was a pleasant surprise as I'm definitely hitting them up again."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fresh. Ordered a family size lasagna for us to be delivered. Delicious! Highly recommend this place- don't really get the bad reviews???? Been going here for years and is always consistent."}
{"text":"The salads were good and generous. Delivery took about ten minutes longer than the already lengthy promised original time. The thin crust pizza was not bad. Same goes for the pasta.  But since it's the only option around I would order from here again."}
{"text":"Eat in is now closed, take out only. Took more than 30 minutes for 3 sandwiches and we were the only order they had. Food was cold and poorly assembled. Hope this store is the exception of the Rosati franchise. Will not return."}
{"text":"I love this place! The environment is fun, food is great and the staff is fantastic. Rosatis's \"The Pub\" has become our go to spot to celebrate birthdays, good grades, baseball wins, and any random day/night. A huge thank you to The Pub for always showing us a great time. I highly recommend if you want a fun atmosphere, to meet new friends and have some great food."}
{"text":"Food was good service was bad. I liked our server Ashley nice girl, nice personality, but fails in priorities of work. She needs retraining. Other waitress I believe her name was Tara was very attentive."}
{"text":"Me and My Gal stop by there they have a very full menu, we ordered a burger, Fry's, onion rings, Italian sandwich and a salad to go.

The burger was good, they forgot to add the french fries to the bag not the bill, the Italian sandwich had plenty of meat a slice of tomato thick bread but no condiments, making for a very dry sandwich, the salad was nothing but lettuce. Cost $24.00, definitely not worth the cost."}
{"text":"I ordered the a deep dish pizza last week. The pizza was delivered within about an hour. The flavors were good but it had waaaayyyyy too much sauce. I suggest ordering it with light sauce and you will probably get a well sauced pizza."}
{"text":"I've been eating Rosatis since I was a pre-teen and this location makes a well made pizza...the crust was perfectly crisp throughout and the cheese crisped lightly brown. This makes me happy that they're back out this way...looking forward to more pizzas and calzones in the future."}
{"text":"Taste like a microwave pizza I can get at walmart next door for under $5. Stiff cheese and dried pizza. And it was supposedly fresh out the oven. Spent way too much for this lack of pizza."}
{"text":"Our softball team practically crashed this place with over 35 people. The servers and staff did a great job and the food was great."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend but was terrible.   They delivered the wrong pizza and when I called them about it they acted like I was putting one over on them.  The first person I talked to said they could give me a discount next time I order but they couldn't bring the right pizza.  I had to talk to the owner to get them to send the correct order. 

This is terrible customer service.  Two hours after I ordered I still have no food."}
{"text":"This is the absolute WORST Rosatis location I have ever tried. We moved to this area about two years ago and ordered when we first moved in. It was so unimpressive we didn't try it again until recently. We figured everyone is entitled to an off day...What a mistake! It ended up with us leaving the disgusting excuse for a Chicago style pizza on the front porch for the driver to pick back up for a full refund. When I called, the woman I spoke to informed me she was the owner and unfortunately she had zero customer service skills and didn't seem to care that we were disappointed with their subpar food. It was plainly obvious she was super annoyed to be getting any feedback and rather than try to make it right, she got defensive as if I haven't tried and been impressed with SEVERAL other locations. I've never had a single complaint about any other Roastis I've been to. It's too bad bc this is the closest pizza joint to our house."}
{"text":"I was in the area for lunch and decided to call Rosati's to see if they had pizza slices, well they did.  I bought one slice and a \"pop\", If you're from Chicago you know what i'm talking about.  I'm glad I only got one slice because it was huge!!  The beautiful young lady at the counter was very kind and friendly,  Anyway's, please drop by whenever you're in the area!  Pizza is great, the employees are great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible... Not only was our food 2 hours late, the pizza was cold, the mozzarella sticks were cold, and there was ranch spilled all over the bag and container.  The order was placed as pick up even though we ordered delivery AND told them our hotel with my cell phone number. Delivery guy still never called when he got here cause \"they had no contact info\". Then refused to discount or comp anything.  Even after the owner asked me to text him the pictures of the food.  Horrible service, horrible food, horrible ownership... Not recommended at all...We ended up with Pizza Hut :) great company and pizza!!"}
{"text":"I love Rosati's...price is a little higher than some other restaurants, but you get what you pay for. Last night I ordered delivery from this location for the first time and the pizza showed up pretty rough - delivery guy must have been going for speed; about 1/4 of the pizza had folded up over itself. I posted a picture on their facebook page and got an apology in a few hours and a call from the owner the following morning. Jason (the owner) made things right - this is how a small business should be run.

PS the portion of the pizza that did survive was delicious :)"}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas and fried mushrooms last night. Food was stellar. Best pizza I've had since moving to the valley. I'm originally from Chicago so I know good food and good pizza. Our order was delivered with a smile and sooner than expected. Will definitely order from this location again!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and wings for delivery tonight and I see no. Need to ever order from anyone else.  The pizza was perfect and the wings were great. Thank you finally someone got it right."}
{"text":"Good Chicago-style pizza, but the chicken-parm sandwich was outstanding."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best pizza in town. I always order pizza from here and have it delivered. The wings are delicious too! All around just great pizza and wings here. People working there are always kind, delivery guy is always chill. Anytime I want pizza this is where I go! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first and my gf wanted it again for breakfast the next day and I almost agreed. We had the thin crust pep, jale, and bell pep and it was amazing! The employees seemed friendly and the pizza didn't take long at all.  We ate there again a few days later (same pizza) but this time I wanted to try the \"jumbo wings\" once again we loved that pizza but I didn't like the wings at all.  The wings could be crisper and I got a bunch of mutant wings (weird shaped and a bunch of broken bones). I'll def be back again but never for the wings."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve one star. Placed an order online though yelp Eat24. Called to confirm that my order would be delivered accurately since I have had 3 previous deliveries screwed up. 
Well, ordered a salad with 1 ranch, 1 Italian dressing. Received 2 Italian dressings. 
Ordered --mind you as part of the special--a 2liter of Sprite. Not delivered. 
Ordered cannoli for dessert, they did arrive very nicely. 
The pizza was cold. 
Called the restaurant, manager told me this special was not valid anymore. Said sorry, said he'd have the soda and another cannoli sent to us. They redelivered the Sprite, 2 ranch dressings and what u think is 2 more Italian dressings that look and smell rotten, the cannoli is a teramusu. 
Epic failure Rosati's."}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Atmosphere!!!  They also have a lot of TV's to watch your favorite games!"}
{"text":"If you are pressed for time and need a quick bite, try Rosati's for lunch. The service was very prompt and the staff is very friendly. The pizza was good, too."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good. The customer service is excellent.  Except for one lady that works there is always kinda rude, but its okay because the chef that takes our order makes up for it. He always gives us good deals! The calzone is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this location 2 stars is because the staff was really friendly and helpful, even on the phone. 

I used to frequent the Dobson/Baseline location and LOVED their pizza. It closed awhile ago and I have since moved to Mesa. When I saw a Groupon for this location, I was very excited
even though it was still a 20 minute drive from my house. However, the quality of the food was very poor, and I will not go back to this location. It's unfortunate that it can vary so much from franchise to franchise.

The crust was soft and doughy. A Chicago thin crust pizza should have a crispy crust. There was so little sauce, I can't tell you what it tasted like and the cheese was so sparse, in places there wasn't any. 

The cheesy garlic bread was passable, nothing special about it. I didn't care for the flavor of the marinara, but that could just be my personal preference. 

We also got a Cesar salad that was way overpriced for the size. 

Needless to say, I was very disappointed as I was really looking forward to this splurge meal."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about a year since we live close by because we love the pizza.  But I refuse to wait over an hour for a pizza when there are only a couple of people inside.  This is the ellsworth and brown location."}
{"text":"I really liked Rosati's when they opened, but this location has changed over the years. The pizza is thin and crispy which I like very much, but the toppings are expensive and the pizza became very greasy after some time. My advice is to skip the pastas here, as they are also very greasy and the tomato sauce lacks any flavor. I've never experienced poor service here, but if you come for the lunch buffet, you may have to wait for them to rotate the pizzas. It's very inexpensive to eat the buffet, but be sure to request a certain type of pizza if you don't love everything. Only two pies go out at a time, and they are often sausage or pepperoni."}
{"text":"We always forget about this little gem! Good pizza in north Las Vegas similar to real Chicago pizza. The food is good service is mediocre. They're a little slow so allow some time, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I think I must have gotten Misti Y's pizza! I worked in Chicago for 4 years so I know my deep dish pizzas. Unfortunately, chewing on a \" brick o' cheese\" isn't my wife's favorite past time. So we ordered the pan pizza (like Pizza Hut). The girl took my order, and even though I live just around the block, I decided to wait....and wait.

I saw the girl pull out a deep dish, box it up, and hand it to me. I told her that I ordered a pan pizza. The tag on it clearly said PAN PIZZA. But she told me that it would take another long wait to make another pizza. So I took the deep dish home, which the Mrs. wasn't happy about. I was actually pretty happy with the quality of the pizza (10X better than the Giordano's I had in Chicago last time). It wasn't Gino's East, but then again... who is?"}
{"text":"Always great pizza and take-out service. Pizza is consistently good and hot, ready when it says it's going to be ready.  Great coupons in the mail too!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Great pie sauce is great, no alcohol at this location but a bar next door.  I have been a customer for over four years delivery is a little slow but worth it"}
{"text":"UPDATE 9/23/17 - this place is in need of some quality wait staff.  Our server tonight was so RUDE!   Actually yelled at a few of us.  We had a party of 13, designated one person to order for the table- well she couldn't handle that!   Actually yelled I can only take one order at a time!!   Kept trying to box up the  food as we were eating it.  

Attn Judd- either get a good staff or be closed within 6 months.  


Pizza is great, dining room servers need a bit of consistenty one day you can order an item a certain way, come back a week later & new server says kitchen says it can't be done.  Everything should be the same no mater who the server is.

UPDATE:  I don't know what's going on here. Last few times we've dined in & picked up the pizza ha been dried out, like it's been sitting for a while. 

The servers actually handed us a pizza box (flattened) for our leftover pizza when she seen us struggling assembling the box & said \"Yeah, I have trouble with those too\". DIDN'T offer to do it or help!  

When we asked for clean plates, after our salad, we were told \"Yeah, these are our last clean plates, we don't have a dishwasher\".  I sure hope nobody came in to eat after us!!  

Don't try to give cashier exact change with your bills, because she can't figure out how to give change.  For example our bill was $70.33, we gave her $100.33. She changed to $100 bill then had to get the calculator out!!  Then gave us an attitude!!"}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times and have always enjoyed my lunches. Last time I went I had ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich. Boy was that puppy good! I ordered the Au Jus sauce on the side and it was an absolutely delectable combination. 

I've also had the Chicago Dog's here and they are fantastic as well. I enjoy this place since it's close to home and work!"}
{"text":"This place used to be the best in town but now it has gone down hill fast. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I used to go to the Henderson one often but I like this one better. Rosatis pizza is some of my favorite pizza in the city. Try the deep dish!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious!  One of the best deep dish pizzas I have had with very fresh ingredients.  We even got the cinnamon sticks for dessert and were pleasantly surprised at how many you get for the price.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Eric the bartender is the absolute best! Stop by and ask for him. Very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Fantastic pies, yet my favorite thing about this place is that I can honestly say they have the best customer service I have ever experienced. Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"We have been using this location for several years. Looking at the reviews, I definitely feel they are better than presented here. Yes, we do have the occasional issue but they have always corrected it within a reasonable period of time. Considering they have one of the best pizzas this side of the Hudson, they are well worth trying."}
{"text":"The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is it takes a little longer than I like for delivery.  Having said that, they have AWESOME thin crust pizza and the staff is really nice over the phone and so are the drivers that come to your house.  I have been searching for a good pizza delivery since I moved here from California and I have definately found it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and won't be back. We were so disappointed. We ordered the pan crust, pepperoni pizza and thought that frozen pizza tasted better. We didn't even finish the first slice. We should have looked at the other reviews before coming here."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Rosati's. We were greeted by Courtney who was amazing, friendly and helpful with our order. Deep dish pizza's duration was about 45mins so order first before coming to the store. Pizza was delicious. We think it should be cooked a lil more. Next time, we'll have to get the smaller ones."}
{"text":"I was working in the area, normally when in that area I lean toward the Roberto's Taco Shop, in the same strip mall, but I wasn't in a Mexican mood. So I tried Rosati's.

They had several lunch specials, one was a slice of pizza and a drink, for a little more you get two slices with the drink, I think it was $7.40 with tax (that included a up sale of 50 cents per slice to add pepperoni) . So I got my drink and sat down. Soon the girl from the counter came with two plates, I assumed one was for someone else, but no they were both for me. Apparently the special meant large slices, so it's actually two normal slices per slice, so I have 4 slices of pizza. The single slice, which would have been two slices, would have been plenty, I try not to eat a large meal during the hot weather, it makes me sleepy after lunch.

The pizza was good.
The crust, crisp on the outside, chewy inside and a good taste to it.
The sauce, lite on the sauce, which I like, nice taste, not bland or over powering.
The cheese, a good grade of mozzarella and a good portion of it.
The pepperoni. good and it was between layers of the cheese. Layer of cheese, pepperoni, another layer of cheese. You don't have the little pepperoni cups of oil on top and not a noticeable amount of oil trapped between the cheese layers.

I tried to eat it all, but didn't make it. Ended up taking one of the four slices in a to go box, I should have taken two slices to go, or ordered the single slice, which would have been two slices.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.

I will eat there again."}
{"text":"I recently purchased their Chicago style pizza and was greatly disappointed. The crust was flavorless and too thin on the bottom. I can't say I like the sauce that much either. I may give their regular pizza a shot sometime, but I don't feel like I will be returning anytime soon.

The wings were delicious though. It's too bad the pizza was so meh."}
{"text":"Rosati's has got to be one of my favorite pizza places here in Vegas.  They have a couple locations all around Vegas. Although it is kind of pricey it's definitely worth it. They have a variety of styles of pizzas. My favorite is they're supreme Chicago style seep dish pizza. Facilities are clean, service was good, and employees were friendly. Overall a great place to eat good pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from them and had chicken Caesar salad and hot wings. The chicken in the salad was frozen... Still. And they did not include the dipping sauces we asked for, for the wings. Would not order from here again."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Thin crust or double dough. Both are loaded with sauce which is sweet and salty and packed with cheese which is amazing because when it's hot it strings off and you can eat it plain. Writing this review is making my mouth water for it. The little girl at the counter is super sweet and very helpful. The owner actually came out and chatted with me for a little bit too! ( I sat in ) there is seating for 5 inside and 3 outside which isn't the best but still good. They sell pizza by the slice and if you get the deal with a can its only 5 bucks! A little pricey for everything but it is sooooooooo worth it!

OMG it's been four months and I'm a regular! The owners know me by first name. And I just love their pizza. Literally if you don't want pizza you can get something else and that's amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Italian Chicago family owned.  It's yummy. We ordered the xl with spinach,  bell peppers,  onions,  green olives, pineapple. Plus jumbo bbq wings. Pretty great tasting."}
{"text":"Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that..."}
{"text":"Ashleigh took my order. Was not accurate. I placed an order at 7:09pm night shift is horrible at customer service satisfaction. I called and let them know my order was not accurate due to miscommunication and placing on hold the whole time. My 33.00 dollar order including a tip (which I shouldn't have thanks to the nice driver) I called back to inform employees of my item that wasn't delivered, I talk to Carla in which her customer service skills sucked .she hung up the first time..leaving me to drive there to handle that myself lol but due to maturity and self control I gave compliments to driver and phone service satisfaction sucked big time! I will be calling corporate and saving my tab to show error in the whole situation. This location sucks!! Ipay for good quality and service! Get it together!! Carla and Ashleigh at the losee road location please and thank you! Bad business decisions.. bad results!!"}
{"text":"When I want Pizza delivered in Summerlin I call Rosati's. I am slightly out of their delivery range but they deliver anyway and are no longer charge me a nominal extended delivery fee. Their thin crust extra large pepperoni is my regular order. I can eat it for days. Delivery is consistently 45 mins or less. 

Online order would be convenient but staff is always friendly when i call. The chicken fingers I tried once were meh or I would rate higher."}
{"text":"Their customer service is horrible! Had an entertainment book coupon, nowhere on the coupon does it specify dine in only like other businesses who participate with the entertainment book. In fact it even states Valid anytime with only the location being specific to desert inn/hualapai. They respond with oh well we aren't going to honor something printed a year ago. Well because they refuse to honor a simple coupon to help satisfy a customer, they loose out on my $40 business. Thank you Rosati's for making me feel like a values customer. Your catch phrase should be satisfaction not guaranteed or rosatis a greedy corporation , where greed actually means more than customer satisfaction, thank you again for reminding me how accommodating people are now a days. Wish you great business karma!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in Vegas! Besides for the food being yummy the staff was super helpful! I was having a party and they did not try to oversell me, we ended up with the perfect amount of food! I heard they are under new Management. thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza. It's the best in the neighborhood.  But I work for a pizza place now so probably won't get their pizza as much. But it's the best on a non cook night in my home"}
{"text":"Never tried Rosati's before so I decided to stop by there today to try it out for the first time since its around the block fromy my house. Worst $10 ever spent, WORST pizza ever tasted in all of the Valley, Worst Chicken Parm sandwich EVER. 
I asked for one slice, hoping I wouldnt get the slice that was sitting in the carousel for hours. He didnt pull the slice of pizza first, so I assumed he was cooking a new pie. Wrong! I got the slice from the carousel, hardened, crusty cheese, dried up sauce and a crust fit for a chewing toy for a dog. 
Chicken Parm was old dried up chicken, loaded with sauce that basically made the whole hoagie soggy and fall apart. 

Needless to say, first impression was BAD. Never going back to Rosati's ever again. Ill stick to a Digiorno's and be happier. 

Only get one chance to make a first impression!"}
{"text":"BOOOOOOOO I like Rosati's Pizza but not this location.  Seriously they are bad.  Rude on the phone, delivery takes forever and the pizza shows up cold....SERIOUSLY?

And, if you request to change out bell peppers for jalapenos, they charge you.  No other Rosati's does that.

Today I am ordering from Little Chicago's Pizza.  The girl who answered the phone was a doll so if the pizza is as good as she was sweet, I am in for a treat!

I am so glad Rosati's did not answer their phone today....yes I was going to order even though I cannot stand this location because I have a hang over and was being lazy...It's true :)"}
{"text":"The food is of poor quality. The crust is close to cardboard. The salad did not taste good. The server asked us if we wanted more drinks and and we had to ask again to get them. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and wings waited 25 minutes the wings are cold and dry the pizza dough is as tough as leather..the young lady that took my order was awesome..23 bucks in 

Thanks for the reply i called the store and the young lady that picked up was rather nasty and said the manager was busy i left my number and have yet to get a call back so the trashed the food the next day. Im not sure what else i should have done?"}
{"text":"Beware of this place. I ordered a lunch special and it was $7.99. The sandwich fries and drink were included. Sweet and hot peppers were complimentary. My bill was 8.95. How did it get that high? I ordered sweet and hot. They upcharged me! They try to nickel and dime you for other things here all the time. Buyer beware. Seems like the mob priced the menu."}
{"text":"The next best thing to pizza from home!  The thin crust sausage cut into squares brings back memories from growing up in Chicago, home of the best pizza in the world"}
{"text":"Terrible front desk lady. She gives you nothing but attitude and failed to put my order in when I came to pick it up. She did not offer any apologies just nasty attitude. The pizza is good but not the service."}
{"text":"Close to home and the pizza is good. I ordered the spicy Italian calzone with fries and some parmesan garlic wings. No complaints."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. I was raised in Chicago and have  since lived in several different states but have yet to find any pizza outside of Chicago that is really good. Several years ago when visiting Phoenix my parents introduced me to Rosati's pizza because they said it tasted close to what we used to eat when we lived in Chicago. It was pretty good. Then after 6 years I went back to Phoenix last week and had another Rosati's pizza. Oh my, someone in the company must have changed the sauce because it now tasted ordinary and certainly no longer tasted anything close to how a pizza made in Chicago tastes. Different recipe, ruined it. And that is not the only problem. Never in my life have I had to pay $20 for a 16\" plain cheese pizza. Ripped off in price and flavor."}
{"text":"I've never visited the establishment, but I always order takeout. Hot, fresh, amazing food. It will take 60 mins + to get it so plan for that. Also order the tiramisu. It's semi frozen, but let it thaw and omg. Best thing I've ever had. Amazing Italian delivery food. Order now!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! And the best Rosati's location in the east valley. The food is always great and I always get exactly what I order. My kids will ever eat their pepperoni because they put the cheese on top of the pepperoni

Aside from the food it's a family run location and they treat you like family."}
{"text":"Not for me

On this visit we ordered the 2 slice one topping pizza with drink lunch deal. The slices of pizza at Rosati's  are large and the toppings are plentiful however the pizza itself just wasn't very good.  I don't know, maybe I was expecting too much but in my opinion,  the pizza was just  below average at best. There are other pizza restaurants in the area that I would prefer to go to.

Not in a rush to visit again."}
{"text":"I absolutely looooooove the Chicago Deep Dish here! The sauce tasted amazing and the cheese tasted wonderful. They quoted us 45 minutes while the pizza baked but it was ready in just half the time. The staff was very warm and welcoming. I dined in with my friend and they treated us as if they knew us for years."}
{"text":"-5  pizza sucks , changed the sauce , ask for extra sauce , still no sauce. They put it around  the edge so it looks like there is some sauce.  It used to be sweet and delicious, would bubble out of  the cheese  when you bit into it ,now it taste horrible similar to chef Boyardee canned ravioli . They have sent me so may bad pizzas , i don't even like pizza anymore . My favorite food  for almost  60 years. Find somewhere else, tell a friend"}
{"text":"I was excited there was a higher end pizza place nearby when I moved to the area, too bad I'll never go here again. 

First of all, the prices were crazy. I figured paying that, I would get amazing customer service. It was horrible.

I called the order ahead, and arrived for pick up in 20 minutes. When I got there, The person behind the counter was texting on their phone. They looked annoyed that I interrupted them to see if my order was ready. She told me it wasn't ready. I waited in the lobby for 20 more minutes. With no customers going in or out, and the clerk still on the phone. 

I saw a pizza sitting in the warmer behind the counter that was there when I got there and I started to wonder if it was mine. After 30 minutes of waiting in the lobby someone from behind came out and explained to the rude clerk that that pizza in the warmer was actually mine, so here I am paying astronomical prices for mediocre cold pizza and nearly an hour of my time wasted."}
{"text":"Since moving to Glendale I have rarely encountered rude business owners, especially during economic downtimes. Apparently the owner (or at least who I'm guessing is the owner) of this establishment (stocky bald guy) doesn't care about his customers. We came in with some local med students, and being students we asked for the cashier to split up the bill. He came over apparently upset and made a snide comment. The pizza wasn't even close to Chicago style deep dish, but whatever enjoyment the food might have offered was soured by the poor management. Definitely do not recommend! I posted this on their other review page too."}
{"text":"Won't be back. You would think when you spend $35 on one large sausage pizza and 12 wings that they would be good. First of all when I called to order their customer service was horrible. The girl I spoke with acted annoyed when I asked her anything, including what my total was. Then the pizza arrived cold, and late. The hot wings we ordered were disappointing. Instead of coating them in the hot sauce they literally just poured the sauce on the top wings and called it a day. They were too lazy to toss the wings so that they all have sauce on them. All of the bottom wings didn't have sauce and the top ones were overly coated in it. They gave us bleu cheese instead of the ranch we asked for (it even said ranch on our receipt) ... Overall, they suck and we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was a total disappointment. We ordered takeout: a large veggie pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks. I'm not joking when I say we got 20 small soggy fries at the bottom of a paper bag. The dipping sauces were huge and so it was like a joke that we got all this sauce for basically no fries. The pizza was the smallest large I've seen, and was topped with frozen broccoli stalks. Wtf? When you say broccoli is an option, no one assumes that's the frozen stalk bits. Worst $34 dollars I've spent in awhile. Do not recommend, unless you're looking for disappointment."}
{"text":"Ordered a Caesar salad with extra Caesar dressing & 3 extra ranch cups for the pizza. Got home and to my unpleasant surprise received 4 Italian dressings and 2 oils vinaigrettes . Pay more for Rosati's and don't even get the order correct. Not even close."}
{"text":"We are here from San Diego staying with our in-laws and decided to order delivery -- we are big fans of Rosatis and used to frequent this location when we lived here. The prices may be on the higher side but the food was so worth it - delicious just how we used to remember it (we kept it simple with a thin crust pepperoni). Delivery was pretty quick (my in laws live close by) and the delivery guy was super friendly -- think his name was Kyle? The girl who answered the phone (Zuly) was really sweet even though we were \"those people\" that ordered close to closing time. It makes me sad to see this place gets such bad reviews -- it's been a good place for a long time and its one of the few things we miss from Vegas now that we live in SD!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible service!  They cannot deliver a pizza in under an hour and always say it's a few minutes away if you call to check on it after waiting an hour and a half..  If it weren't for the fact that no other pizza places around here deliver as late, I would never order from this place!"}
{"text":"They said 35 min. when we called in our order. We were late, arriving at 50 min., and it still was not ready.  We waited at least another 15 minutes after arriving. The employees were nice enough, but obviously there is a problem with their organization and procedures.  I note other reviewers have similar comments.  This location is primarily a pick-up location.  Don't expect to dine here.  There's one booth and one table.

Regarding the food, the bleu cheese for the wings was like mayo. The wings were fine. Pizza was good but nothing different or special.

Overall, very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Got take out pizza for movie night, my daughter came to pick it up and they kept sending her to different places, she finally ended up getting it from the bartender (she's 18 and shouldn't even be allowed in the bar). Then the pizza didn't taste good, the sauce is runny and has an odd after taste, the crust was soggy & the cheese greasy. It reminded us of school cafeteria pizza. And a personal pet peeve a round pizza cut into tiny squares."}
{"text":"Sunday June 4th 2017  called 4:15 PM

We live in the area and wanted to try something other than our regular thin crust pizza.  Their Deep Dish crust is handmade buttery goodness!!!  Heads up the pizza does take longer to cook (most deep dishes do).   It wasn't a problem to wait the extra 10 minutes.  We ordered pick up and the gentlemen on the phone said it'd be 35 minutes.

Perfectly made world famous Chicago deep dish."}
{"text":"Their double dough pizza was the best pizza I've ever had in Las Vegas. 

Their lunch specials are also amazing and I think it's cool they have gluten free pizza as well. 

Their salads look so good. I highly recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"This place it not the same! Maybe they're on the verge of closing? They have changed their hours and are barely open on the weekends now. Their deepdish Chicago pizza used to be LARGE, DEEP, PLENTYFUL, BUTTERY, AND DELICIOUS. Now it's SRINKING, DRY, BLAND, AND NOT DEEP AT ALL. Will probably never come here again because I know they are barely trying to stay afloat. I feel bad but I just can't throw my money away like this to support a business who is not trying to provide a consistent product.
Gave it two stars, one for cooking \"it\" and one for having \"it\" ready."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great Chicago-style pizza, Rosati's is the place to go.  As a new Las Vegas resident, it's been my task to find decent pizza and Rosati's brings the flavor and quality of those small Chicagoland pizzarias to the Las Vegas area.  Delivery service usually takes an hour, but the hour is well worth it as pizzas are delivered hot and well-made.  The buffalo wings are delicious and mozzarella sticks are good.  

Rosati's thin-crust pizza is delicious and exactly as it's made in Chicago.  The cheese is delicious and the italian sausage is flavorful and slightly spicy.  

Rosati's deep-dish is great with chunks of tomato in the sauce.

Their pan pizza is very similar to Chicago-style pans.  My only complaint is that the crust could use some additional flavor, maybe a more buttery consistency. 

Overall, I've used this Rosati's for delivery 32 times since I discovered it in March 2011.  Excellent food quality and fair delivery times."}
{"text":"I was in the area and was craving Chicago style pizza. Did a quick search and found this place. 

Ordered the Chicago style meat mania. The dough didn't taste fresh because the crust was hard, there was too much ground beef on it and the sauce tasted like it was out of a jar. Also got the double dough Monster and the cheese was rubbery and the green olives were unpleasant. Also got wings and they tasted like frozen out of the bag wings which also turned rubbery after a while. 

Overall this place is overpriced and overhyped. Those two pizzas and 12 wings was 60 bucks. Definitely won't be wasting my money here again."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust pizza - despite Chicago being known for deep dish, some of us prefer the crispy, cracker-thin pizza cut into perfect squares rather than large triangles that need to be folded. Rosatis has perfected the sauce/cheese ratio. Great flavor. Love Rosatis!"}
{"text":"This location offers an online coupon for $99.99 catering special. I ordered this and when I went there to pick it up the gal at the register told me it was $129.99. 30% more than what is quoted online. I asked for the manager and the he did not honor the online price.  I told them they need to update their website. I will NEVER go here again and I will not refer anyone here.  If I could give a ZERO star review I would!"}
{"text":"I should have taken the reviews seriously!

My husband placed an order for delivery and were told it would be 20 min to an hour....well an hour and a half later the pizza guys shows up at our hotel room door with lukewarm pizza that was probably sitting under a heat lamp for a long time, no dressing for the salad, no plates, no napkins, no parmesan or chili flakes, all of which we made sure to ask for . The pizza sucked! It was cut into square shapes...why Rosatti's??? Why??? It was dry, the crust was hard as a rock, the cheese was dry and chewy...just plain sucked!  After spending the day hiking, all we wanted to do was relax and enjoy a piping hot delicious pizza...but noooo Rosattis's insisted on giving us sh*tty service, sh*tty food, and a sh*tty ttitude when we called to complain!!!

I highly do NOT recommend this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Wings. Ok Service.  Average Delivery Service. Average, or less food quality. Just Couldn't Figure out why My delivery order item was hidden under an order of fries. By the time I called to inquire about the missing dinner, it wasn't worth eating. Counter told me when I phoned, \"That's how we do it. It's always under the fries\" ?????  First time I've seen a restaurant that was either too lazy or too cheap to place an entr√©e in a proper to go box. Honestly, I would probably only order again if I was too lazy to do something better for dinner. **** Update **** Place did close down. Replaced by Paradise Valley Pizza, Why am I not surprised?  Thanks for the compliment Robert! You must have worked there!"}
{"text":"I went here this past Thursday, April 29th with my boyfriend because I have been craaaving chicago style, DEEP DiSH pizza. Right off the bat, I'm letting you know that this 3 star rating will change soon enough :P Long story short, my bf did NOT specify that we wanted deep dish & we ended up getting a thin crust pepperoni pizza & 12 mild chicken wings.

I was very disappointed because I've been wanting a fresh, deep dish pizza & on the way home I was already thinking this pizza was not going to be as good as I'd like it to be. The 16 inch pizza was sliced into squares, which was fine & the pepperoni looked like it was barely there because it was covered with cheese :) The pizza was really a THiN crust & it wasn't hard/crunchy or burnt. The mild chicken wings were perfect! The sauce had just enough \"mildness\" & the wings had some extra sauce in the container that I would use for some of my pizza ;) fatty, I know.

I will be back to try your deep dish & you will eventually earn my stars!! Even though it was our fault we didn't specify the deep dish pizza :( haha"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of this location since it opened.  Other than a short period years ago, the pizza and wings have been excellent.  Rosati's is my go-to pizza when I want consistent, good, thin crust pizza.  There are better pizza places out there, but not many.  The wings are larger than most and the wing sauce is the pretty standard but very good.  The only knock may be the pizza prices (other food is in line with other businesses), but they always have coupons available.  I've never had any issues with the staff as they have always been pleasant and efficient.  It's not quite a 5 star place, but it's certainly 4 1/2 or better."}
{"text":"Delicious like always!! Cheesy beefs with hot peppers always on point!! Pizza is always great as well."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service I ever had. I call and order three things for delivery they show up with two because they're out of wings but don't bother to call me on the number I gave them and say they called some other number so now I have to sit here and not eat dinner ? Yeah that's ridiculous. Then I call and they don't even do anything about it. Never again. Save your money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ive tried this place twice and both times I wasn't impressed at all. 

1st time I had the mozzarella sticks: average frozen fried kind,  ravioli with meat sauce meatballs and sausage: the sauce tasted a little burnt to me and everything else was good

2nd time I had
\"Jumbo\" (actually normal sized) wings, which were good I asked for ranch they sent blue cheese, a meatball hero w/ fries: asked for lite on the sauce they used a lot the way they melt the cheese left most of it on the foil and not the hero the bun seems a little stale and again that burnt sauce taste, I also ordered the deep dish chocolate cookie with ice cream, now I realize this was delivery so I wasn't expecting much of the ice cream but it arrived very much in tact the only issue was the freezer burn (seemed the ice cream is portioned out and refrozen) and the cookie was a little hard but very good. 

I still rate it average as the food was OK and everything arrived in time and hot."}
{"text":"I ate Rosati's pizza from Homer Glen, IL when I lived in IL, so I was definitely stoked that there are plenty of Rosati's here in Phoenix! 
Chicago style deep dish, check.
Chicago thin crust, check.
Allll the toppings that a pizza place should have, check.
HOT GIARDINERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CHECK, CHECK, CHECK!

I have a really hard time living without giardinera, and it greatly pleases me that they stay true to the  Chicago roots and have it! 
I won't describe it because I'm not a good enough writer to do it justice. Just know that every pizza and sandwich you've ever had in your life is missing this delicious SPICY giardinera. 
Maybe it's not good for a first date, but if you can't bond over food, maybe you don't need a 2nd date anyway, because all people need to eat.

As far as service goes, it's not an upscale restaurant. It's a typical pizza place. The girls on the phone have always gotten my order correctly, and I don't need anything but that. 

Get the giardinera on the side. You absolutely can have it baked in your pizza, but trust me, you want to appropriately drown your slice and savor the goodness yourself.

Not for bland palates. Try pizza hut. 

The spiciness will rid you of any extra calories from the delicious (because it's real!) cheese, so don't you worry waistlines, you can still fit in your pants.

Don't forget to look for coupons too. There's some on their website."}
{"text":"Coming here turned out to be a great idea! I don't usually write about a restaurant's ambiance, but as soon as I stepped foot inside I was instantly on the show \"Cheers\". But, with kids here and there and good food... and skinny jeans on quite a few patrons! Point is it had a real home-y feeling to the place.. as if I'd been going there all my life!

On to the eats, we ordered a meat lovers ( or meat maniac..something meaty) Rosati's deep dish and I also got the spicy beef dip.  The pizza was actually really delicious and it was packed with meats; sausage, pepperoni, beef, and bacon! Maybe I'm new to the deep dish concept, but there was light marinara a pile of meat then cheese on top! This was a real grownup pizza and it drove our kids (all under 9) nuts! They were looking for more of a traditional pie! 

The second act, the spicy beef dip! It was great! The giardiniera was really good and had a lil bite to it adding a nice balance of textures! The beef was very tender and unexpectedly shaved, which was a pleasant surprise, and lived up to the spice in its name! The bread was chewy and substantial making dipping the sandwich an awesome experience because it was able to hold its own! 

If your looking for an old school dine in pizza experience I'd recommend this place! The servers were really kind and will make you feel like family rather than a customer, and although there is so much more to try, I have faith they won't let you down!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to begin our quest for a really good pizza in our own neighborhood.  Rosati's is a small restaurant in a strip mall-what isn't in south Scottsdale?  You order at the counter and get your own drink, but they do bring the food to your table.  Supposedly, it's \"Chicago-style\" pizza.  Never been there, so wouldn't know.  Also available are thin crust and double dough (in between thin crust and deep dish).  Rosati's also has a variety of appetizers, pasta dishes, salads, and hot dogs & burgers for some reason.

I thought the food was average at best.  We had breadsticks and a double dough Hawaiian pizza.  The breadsticks were pretty generic, served with a marinara type sauce I thought was lacking flavor.  The pizza was average as well.  We ordered a 14-inch which was way too much for two people.  The double-dough crust is actually thicker than we expected.  I did like the pizza crust, but the sauce was pretty bland.  I also thought the cheese had an odd flavor, not bad just not typical mozzarella.  Then I noticed they blend their own cheeses.  My husband remarked, \"that explains it-they must have used one of those foot cheeses.\"  That means Romano or something else pungent for those of you who don't know what a \"foot cheese\" is.

I would neither recommend, nor discourage someone from giving it a try.  But I would recommend carry out.  The restaurant must be operated by deaf people because the phone volume was so high it startles you every time it rings.  But then again, it has to be turned up to hear it over the blaring music..hope you're a Lionel Richie fan."}
{"text":"Tied with another pizza place we frequent! We've never had any complaints. We could here at least 2x a month (we don't eat out a lot). My kids LOVE their fettuccine Alfredo. No complaints"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my pizza. All I wanted was either Mac n' Cheese or Pizza, and since not a lot of places will deliver Mac n' Cheese, I went with pizza. Rosati's looked good, especially the deep dish pics because that's my favorite, so I chose them. This was a good decision. Although I was told it would take an hour for my pizza to be delivered, Dave (we named him Dave because he looked like a Dave) showed up well ahead of schedule and was a very nice man. He had a beard, seemed to love his job and wanted nothing more than for us to enjoy our food--we did. Thanks, Dave. I can't wait until the next time I really want deep dish pizza; this is where I will go. 

Oh and the pizza itself was really good. The cheese was excellent and I finished the whole thing in under 4 minutes. Not that the pizza was small, it just tasted so good--I really want another one right now. Thanks again, Dave!"}
{"text":"We only ever get carry-out from Rosati's, but it's always fast and delicious.  Both the pizza and the lasagna keep us coming back.  That being said, the crust is a little on the chewy side and the salads are very plain.  The service is average, everyone usually looks like they're in a big hurry but they always get our order to us without much fuss.  We give them steady business and have not yet had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Pizza was so good! Just like Chicago, minus the scenery..."}
{"text":"So happy this Rosati's opened near us!  We are repeat customers as we love their thin crust pizzas, chicken strips and mozzarella sticks.  Delivery is always fast and drivers are courteous."}
{"text":"Awful. The employees are not familiar with their own menu and the food is overpriced and not tasty. Also, never ever order a cannoli here. Ever. I'm 99% positive they buy it frozen from a box. The employees had no idea that the cannoli was even on the menu and had to ask a bunch of other employees about it. Then they had to ask about where they kept it. I believe it was the manager who responded. She looked very confused like she hadn't had anyone order a cannoli at this Italian restaurant in decades. They finally found it and microwaved it for me and it tasted like freezer burn. I don't know why I was under the impression that they had a bakery case from which to pull out a lovely, fresh cannoli. Pizza is just whatever."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place for dinner back in July.
I am not a deep dish pizza expert but this one was good enough for us.
We ordered a huge one because we had a coupon with a minimum amount. We ate pizza for like 3 days and that box was so heavy you would have thought we had 5 pounds of mozzarella...
Service was good, I think it took a little too long but, oh well, it was a deep dish pizza : )

Hubby and daughter went back again without me."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza! Delivered in a timely fashion and was hot when it got here. Would definitely order again! Used to Chicago style pizza being from that area so I was very impressed with Rosati's."}
{"text":"This place is something of an anomaly.  They do a thin crust pizza that is cut into little squares (and tasty little crust-dominated corner pieces).  This is one of my favorite pizzas on the planet.  

The ONLY reason I hesitate to give this place five stars is because the length of time it takes the pizza to reach your front door and their prices lean more towards the one star range.  

When I'm in San Francisco, I'm used to paying $23 for a large pizza.  Not in Gilbert, Arizona.  

If this place dropped their prices a bit I would order from them two-to-three times a week."}
{"text":"Years ago this place was pretty decent. Haven't been there in a couple years or so because they stopped serving pizza lunch buffet.  That wasn't all great either but not horrible.  Cut to:

Wow!  The only reason I didn't give 1 star is that our waitress tried to be very friendly.  And I said, \"tried\".  The place is disgusting and needs to be renovated, cleaned and painted really bad. It's dimly lit at night so you may not notice but if you take the time to look around, you will see. It might not pass a health inspection. 

I was craving a good Italian sandwich and we actually ended up here because we couldn't find another place my sister recommended but forgot where it was. I saw a picture of what I wanted on the menu and the picture was like a real dream come true. That was the picture. I was waiting for my food, getting all excited to eat a nice, yummy sandwich... And then the waitress brought the food. Ummm... Didn't look ANYTHING like the picture and I totally sunk in my chair like a kid who didn't get what he wanted for Christmas... And then I tasted the sandwich. OMG!  I cannot stress how disappointed I was. Bland, ugly, tasteless sandwich and a side of soggy, undercooked French fries.  The sandwich comes with a side of Italian dressing that I am sure was hidden Valley from a supermarket. The sandwich tasted like black licorice and lettuce. Iceberg lettuce, mushy tomatoes and some meat products that I guess are supposed to be salami and pepperoni? I could go on but anytime I eat really bad food, I ask myself, \"do the people who cook this not taste it ever?\". If they do, do they just have bad taste or do they know it's crap and keep making it the same way? 

Guys, really? Gordon Ramsey has a show called Kitchen Nightmares. You really need to call him. I am not joking around and I assure you, you will be out of business in 2 years if you keep doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that this is the only TRUE pizza in Madison...Those who run with the masses and order the sugary cheap chain pizzas have no clue as to what they are missing.  Treat yourselves someday to the crispy THIN PIZZA with Non-sugary sauce, perfectly spiced, with GENEROUS toppings and tons of melty cheese...ALWAYS delivered HOT.....MELTY....PERFECT..even in single digit temps...Rosati's Sausage is incredible BTW...their own recipe ....I insist you try the Chicago STYLE also some night ...It is BEYOND wonderful and balanced in flavors and textures...from the buttery flakey crust to the rich tomatoey sauce and the generous fillings not to mention the ooooozey cheeses..Check the menu for other items also ..like if you crave (or never even tried) a REAL Chicago Beef...THIS is the place..I get mine\" wet, no cheese, hot Giardiniera\" ...it is AMAZING  and HUGE!!
Ok  well enough bragging about my favorite Madison Place for Take out...but..Trust me  you will NOT be disappointed...i would never lie to you"}
{"text":"I only give this place 3 stars because the staff are kinda rude. My husband and I have been ordering from here for years and there have been many times when we've boycotted this location for a few months because of it. Also, one time the middle of our pizza was falling apart and raw... But Rosati's does make good pizza."}
{"text":"Being a south side of Chicago raised guy, I'm always skeptical trying pizzas that are supposed to be like home.  This one did not disappoint! I had a thin crust sausage pizza, and it was very close to the bar pizzas of the suburbs of Chicago!!! I'd say close to a Vito and Nicks, only with a lighter base crust. If you know what I'm talking about, you can't miss going here in Vegas.  Love that you're here Rosati's and thank you!!"}
{"text":"It's too bad I won't be going back here again. After reading reviews on yelp I was expecting something resembling a New York style pizza. I asked the waitress what the difference was between the four styles of crossed. The thin is very thin and crispy she said and then she showed me a slice of the double though which looked very much like a New York style. So I ordered one of those with tomatoes, Onions and garlic. Thank God I've ordered the Grlic otherwise the thing would've had no flavor at all!

Now I know in New York they don't cut the pizza into squares. And also cheese reaches all the way to the edge of the crust which is about a half an inch or so thick. This pizza missed the mark by a few inches, only the center 2/3 actually was covered with cheese. Lots of bare Sauce and vegetables with the boat and flakes of oregano scattered on touch. I should've known when they handed me the box and it weighed several pounds that this was no New York style pizza! Another thing. Onions and tomatoes need to be Finley sliced and on top of the cheese. Otherwise they get home juicy and it runs down between the slices to the cardboard underneath. The effect of this is that the pizza crust them sticks to the box. I ate some cardboard I'm sure.
So I gave most of the pizza to my house mate who said it was better than a frozen dinner. The saving grace was that I bought a slice of tiramisu for dessert. I took one bite and realized it was half frozen!
So, I'll eat Asian for another six months before I attempt pizza again. Good thing there's so many wonderful Asian choices in this town!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good and hot wings are too. Service has always been good girls have never been rude good customer service. We usually order a Hawaiian a couple days ago we found out it actually comes with pizza sauce and bar b que on it which was so gross. It was just one time the employee didn't ask but now we know and it has been great! Fast service and delivery good hours and location nice parking!"}
{"text":"just got two orders of baked mostacciolli.  One was obviously bad by the overwhelming smell when we opened the lid.  They offered to send me another order but by now the damage was done.  Will not order from here again.
Good luck."}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on with Rosati's. It used to be our favorite go to pizza place, but the last two times we have gone the pizza has been under done in the middle. It feels like they're pulling the pizzas out too quickly in order to make a quick turnaround. Rosati's, please go back to doing things the way you used to so we can continue ordering your pizza weekly."}
{"text":"Two weekends ago I ordered a pizza from her as I have many times before. I ordered a Chicken Alfredo Specialty Pizza. They delivered a pizza without chicken. I called... They said no problem. \"We can make another and send it out today or replace the pizza the next time you order\"
Well... Today I called to order and was told that I only had a $5.00 credit. I then asked to speak to a manager and the manager on duty would not even get on the phone with me and the girl on the phone stated she (the manager on duty) said that the $5.00 credit was issued by the general manager and she could not over ride it. I then asked to speak to the General manager and he was not available. I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service and ended up ordering  from a different place. They did not seem to care one bit that they were losing a customer."}
{"text":"Always amazing!!!! Always hot on delivery, my favorite pizza in Vegas we order at least 3 times a month"}
{"text":"Slow, expensive, and terrible customer service. I had a coupon and they would not honor it since I had ordered from GrubHub before but for a different restaurant. It was a Rosati's coupon for $5 off. I even put it in the instructions on the online order and they still wouldn't honor it. They should have at least called me to address the issue before they showed up with the order over an hour later. Very disappointing. Boo Rosatis!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh man!  This is my favorite Rosati's location for the following:  Fresh ingredients, loaded on my pizza!  I have only ordered the thin crust, and my usual 4 pick is: sausage, mushroom, green pepper, and black olive.  It truly is covered with toppings--no empty spots!  Quick delivery, and the pizza is so hot I have to let it cool down for a minute!  Consistently good--Easy online ordering, payment, and tipping!  Just open the door, sign, and enjoy!

My daughter usually orders a salad along with her pizza, and they have always been fresh and crispy.  Now I'm hungry...."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and had a Rosati's pizza the other day it was really good and I had forgotten how good pizza can taste. It was delivered by a customer of mine and they shared."}
{"text":"This place is on our key card for the Hotel we're staying at. They reason I'm leaving this review is because I don't like the bait and switch tactic. We ordered a pizza and spaghetti for the kids and the total was 39.00. expensive i thought, so i started breaking the cost down. They don't say anything about the delivery charge they just include it. It was $7 But on yelp they say $4. Then they say it's because of the distance. It's not just upfront pricing it's designed to get people off guard that are from out of town. 

This pizza better be good."}
{"text":"Food is great, staff is nice, recommend pickup only. Almost 2 hours for delivery is absurd."}
{"text":"Being so close to Rosati's I've always wanted to try their food. The reviews have kept me away, but when GroupOn offered a deal, I figured this would reduce my risk. 

As a fan of thick crust, I ordered the \"Double Crust\" Deluxe Pizza and a Meatball Sandwich. I will say the pizza toppings were quality, the amount of cheese and flavor respectable. However, what makes a pizza is the crust, and I'll say I've had better crust on frozen pizza. The actual crust was more of a cracker like consistency, and was barely higher than the toppings. And the clincher was, I couldn't even pick up the pizza without the toppings and cheese falling off. Pizza isn't hard to make and they failed.

The Meatball Sub was a little better, again the ingredients were tasty, but the bread--soggy, wouldn't stay together. Eat it with a fork. Oregano's Meatball sub is far far better for the same price. 

Sorry Rosati's I wanted to like you, but there's too many better choices--even if I have to drive further."}
{"text":"Very poor food, late delivery by 40 min, this place is going  down hill. 1 hour was the time given for delivery, after 1 hour 40 min food shows up cold. Not to mention when i placed my order from the menu i was called 10 min later and told we no longer sell these items. I settled with fettuccine alfredo + charged extra for chicken.. when the cold late food arrived with 2 quarter size peices of chicken with a kids meal portion for $11.95, my dissatisfaction grew.i thru away the room temperature  $50 worth of food for fear of getting sick.  I will not order or support this resturant anymore. After 13 years i bid you farewell."}
{"text":"This pizza was absolutely amazing! Don't be taken back By the price that's definitely gonna be more than the average chain pizza joint but if you enjoy fresh homemade Italian pizza Chicago's  Style, you have definitely stumbled upon a gem.  This  Pizza place put me right back in Chicago. The bread sticks alone are a force to be reckoned with they are the best I've ever had in my Life from the  Marinara sauce to the tasty  Real Italian  Sausage, definitely will be sad I don't have one closer to me in California but I cannot wait to come back because Rosati's is 1 of the 1st places on my list to go eat."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I came here during my lunch time and the girl working in the front was super slow. It really took them 35 minutes to make a hot dog and salad combo. I was the only customer waiting and it took them that long to make 1 hot dog . That is ridiculous and on top the long wait my hot dog was super cold. This place also says they open at 11 am which is a lie . This place also opens whenever they please because last time I went around 11:20 and they were still closed. Save your time and money people and don't come here ."}
{"text":"Pizza here is fantastic!! Customer service is downright a scam though. I ordered a pizza with an olive oil base instead of the regular tomato sauce and they charged me $5 extra. It's not enough (obviously) to make me stop coming but it does feel like I just got scammed. If I was only more confrontational..... ugh!"}
{"text":"BEST pizza in Arizona! I get a large thin crust pizza with chicken and garlic. Sometimes I get a side salad with ranch dressing. Even when it's busy, they're delivery service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Rosati's at Ray and McQueen is the BEST!  It is better than even Oregano's!  Thin Crust, thick crust---it doesn't matter.   The sauce is perfect and its just the right amount of cheese as well!  When you are not in a pizza mood, try a Chicago dog with fries or a salad.  This place doesn't disappoint.  Be careful though---you have to go to Ray and McQueen or McClintock and Warner to get GOOD Rosati's pizza.   (The one minus star is for the Italian beef---needs a little work still---kind of dry and flaky instead of juicy.)"}
{"text":"I was here a couple of fridays ago.  Placed a phone order at 5 pm for a large deep dish.  Lady on the phone said they were busy and that it would be a 45-60 minute pick up time.  I figured no problem, it's a Friday night.  I headed over to pick up my $30 Pizza at 6:00.  Pizza still wasn't ready.  Place was very unorganized with at least 10 other people waiting in the lobby for pizza.  The phone kept ringing and the lady kept taking orders even though they clearly were lost and way behind.  Owners just sat around the back of the restaurant watching.  They did not want to help their employees at all.  Finally at 6:45 I left with no pizza.  Waste of a Friday night.  Thanks Rosati's!"}
{"text":"It saddens me to my core to give Rosatis a low score but their service lately has been deplorable! Ever since their management switched, the lack of care took over and it shows in their food and services. Even the restaurant as a whole is not nearly as clean. The food portions changed for anything outside of pizza realm. We ordered chicken Alfredo and my frozen meals from Marie calendars had more noodles and chicken. Paid for a side of ranch, it came out in a tiny plastic container. I couldn't even get my pizza crust in it to even dip. Husband ordered wings, he wasn't impressed. Found hair in our pizza. All around bad experience. We thought maybe we're having an off day. Tried again about a month later, walked in and heard a customer and the owner cussing back and forth over the bar area because the customer commented that the place wasn't like it used to be. That his chicken wings weren't prepared properly and the ranch cups (go figure) were too small to dip his chicken into. I looked at my husband and my kids and we left. Spoke to some fellow Chicagoan's and they agreeably have maintained their displeasure as well. I hope they fix it! Miss that place!"}
{"text":"Horrible. That's all I can say. I ordered a pepperoni supreme but my pizza didn't even have pepperoni on it! It was bland and had so much cheese my daughter was choking. I only ordered because I kept seeing on Groupon (this location didn't even participate in the Groupon offer) and it looked really good. I've learned my lesson, no more Rosati's."}
{"text":"Ordered for game night,

Had both thin and hand-tossed. The thin crust is definitely the way to go, great pizza!

It's a little on the expensive side for pizza, and make sure you ask when you're ordering and have a question, Garlic Bread =/= Cheese Garlic Bread, both excellent, but completely different.

ciao"}
{"text":"Holy smokes heed the warnings. I will never order from here again. Not only is the pizza unimpressive but 2 hours after ordering, it was delivered... Cold. Not the first time experiencing this either."}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicago style deep dish pizza and I asked for garlic. I didn't realize that when I asked for garlic the entire pizza would taste like nothing but garlic. I ordered it for New Year's Eve and the guests couldn't even enjoy the pizza so that was $35 wasted. I've ordered from this location several times and have never had a complaint. I must admit I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"WARNING BAD PIZZA! This is an Olive Alert bad pizza has been reported in your area. If you see a building with the name Rosati's please open your yelp and avoid. The food in a word.. Disgusting. The sauce honesty tasted like acidic vomit. The toppings were of the lowest quality my imagination can accept. We ordered a thin crust from the menu, garlic bread and 2 deserts. I threw it all away ...the deserts are a joke and disgusting. Please management.. Pay attention to this place. There is no excuse for the food you served me yesterday. I had to go out to eat after we got takeout from you.. How can you allow this? How can you be employed as a manager and do absolutely nothing to run your business. Respond to this message and I will help you out. I live 3 blocks away."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with this location.  I ordered take-out which included 1 large pizza, a chicken caesar salad and a chicken sandwich.  I was told on the phone that it would be 20 minutes until ready.  The person on the phone had a very strong heavy accent and was hard to understand.  They did not ask for my name, only took my phone number.  Upon arriving to pick up the order 30 mins later, they had a hard time finding my order (could be because my name wasn't given) and the order was NOT ready once found.  Waited 20 more minutes and still nothing.  I asked twice for the front desk employee to check on my order.  Come to find out, everything was ready except the salad (which in my mind is the easiest thing to throw together).  
While waiting for the last part of my order to be finished, I watched and listened to the employees making pizzas and was shocked to see and hear what I did.  Not only was there loud music blaring, but I watched one employee eat a slice of pizza and then continue to work the dough he had in his hands.  This is not acceptable!!  
A few other things I saw were that they have no uniforms.  The front desk employee who was helping pick-up customers was wearing an under armour tshirt and not very professional.  He seemed confused while answering questions on the phone and I watched him forget about a customer who was waiting for their order.  Completely unprofessional.  

I will not be using this location again and I would hope that the manager and owner would put a little more effort into training their employees, hold the employees accountable and enforce a more appropriate dress policy.  I feel that this 'take-out' location is extremely unorganized with no real direction by management."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery this evening from Rosatis'. We had a Penne pasta and Mostaciolli pasta,Ravi appetizer,Italian Beef sandwich and a Meatball sub. First of all,delivery was very quick. The food was outstanding! This food can seriously stand up to any casual Italian restaurant(i.e. Olive Garden!). Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Wow, how does this place stay in business?
In recent years they have expanded their bar area, so if you wish to stop in for a drink, I guess it works.
However, the food is terrible! While I thought there is no such thing as a bad pizza- I was wrong! 

The owner must have Chicago roots because of all the Chicago sports gear on the walls. If so, make  Chicago style deep dish. Or make a decent thin crust pie. Instead you get neither.

The subs are also uninspired. The meatball sub comes out in a soggy sub roll that is very unappealing."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicago style all meat pizza.  Very disappointed. Where was the meat???  Cheese??? Crust was good but everything else was lacking."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE DEEP DISH PIZZA.  Go to Spinato's, Oregeno's or Rosati's at Shea & Scottsdale.  This location has had tons of time to get it right, and the new owner is just the old owner's son...they open, they close, they open they close...same bad pizza!

Geeez, figure out the deep dish!  I was just in Naples, FL this week and THEIRS was great!  Yours was soggy and under cooked.  Why does this location struggle with each new Owner or is the owner and staff always the same?

Seriously you are the only location that can't get it done right.  It is worth the drive to Scottsdale and Shea for 2 reasons: 1) Will this location be open?  2) How bad will the pizza be...AGAIN?"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Rosati's but this time we were not impressed. We ordered for delivery and we ordered almost 2 hours ago and we are STILL waiting as we speak for them to deliver to effing subs! I will refuse to give these assholes anymore business. We called just 5 minutes ago they said \"We are behind schedule\" Uh, behind schedule would be an hour, NOT 2! Don't waste your time getting delivery from this one!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is amazing and let me tell you about the desserts to die for. Reina was super nice always checking if we're okay."}
{"text":"Our go to delivery place for pizza.  Very good.  This is a good location because it is an actual sit-down restaurant with a full bar.  Most locations are take out and delivery only."}
{"text":"Terrible experience ! Buying a cake from them and discovering that it had green mold in it and it seemed that it has been sitting for weeks! The people that work there didn't even care to check before they gave it to me! The worst part was when I took it back and how rude and unprofessional their staff was.. so i decided to call the police and the Maricopa County health and safety!"}
{"text":"Our go to place when we don't feel like cooking. Their breaded mushrooms are absolutely the best!!!!! Their Ranch dressing is to die for, my husband said he could drink it because it's so good!  My son loves their pizza it's his favorite!! Have never ordered anything I didn't like! Tried their Italian dressing last order and it's delicious! We will continue to order from here when we don't feel like cooking!!!!!"}
{"text":"We normally eat at the Rosati's on N Durango but decided to try this one. What a mistake. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who said sit anywhere and got our drink orders, then disappeared. After deciding what to order we had to hunt down someone to take our order, the hostess was never seen from again. The pizza was pretty good on par with the other Rosati's but the salad was pitiful. Iceberg lettuce with a few brown mushrooms, 2 slices of green pepper, few croutons and a sliver of cheese. The creamy italian smelled and looked greasy mayo. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering pizza from this store for over two years and had never had a problem until tonight. If a customer has a coupon (2 14 inch pizza for 19.99) how can a business say there's a new price and charge you more? And the same coupon for 19.99 is still on the web site!!! Any one with any business sense would have honored the coupon and been out three dollars instead of losing a customer and having that customer tell everyone of the bad customer service."}
{"text":"Nice bar and patio area with lots of tv's for sports fans. Food at this Rosati's is better than any of the other Rosati's I've tried. Especially like their chicken wings, some of the best I've had in this area and of course the pizza has been excellent as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicago deep dish, it was good but nothing like back home. The same story goes for the Italian beef sandwich, good/ok but nothing to write home about. I was initially excited to have some Chicago style food so close to home but I wouldn't get your hopes up. Portillo's is still my go to."}
{"text":"As always the 1st time is the best, 2nd and 3rd mediocre. I got the Pan Pizza which they are obviously known for. Chicago style. Tasted very very good with mushrooms and pepperoni. It's too much dough, so once or twice a year, it's nice to try something new."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza! Ordered the deep dish cookie delivered too. The ice cream was still frozen upon delivery! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great Food,  Bad Customer Service....The food is always awesome just like the Chicago locations.  The pizza is always a winner as is their combination sandwich loaded with Italian beef and sausage.  Their prices are fair. 
     Last time we ate their the customer service was horrible.  The girl brought our drinks and left for 25 minutes.  My husband finally brought our drink glasses up to the front counter for a refill.  If you don't do your job waiting on my family, with kids keep in mind, you get \"NO\" tip. 
     The building was extremely clean,  a little too clean.  If I am eating in your restaurant and the smell of cleaner is so overwhelming, you need to do that after close when customers are not there. 
     My family will order from here again, granted that we place our order to go."}
{"text":"I have frequented this Rosatis location for quite some time but... ...  the past few weeks have FORCED me to look elsewhere for my family Friday night pizza fix.

I work near 32nd Street & Camelback, a good 20-25 minute drive during Friday rush hour.  For the past 3 weeks in a row, I have had nothing but issues simply calling in a pizza to-go order.

The first time, called and was left on hold for over 5 minutes.  Anyone with any restaurant experience will tell you, people calling in to place a phone order typically do not want to hold longer than 2-3 minutes, 5 is considered excessive.  I hung up and called again, left on hold for 8 minutes.  Now keep in mind, I am driving there from my office trying to place the order.  Finally - someone answers the phone and takes my order and guess what???  I am told it will be 45 minutes before my pizzas are ready.  So I had about 15 - 18 minutes already invested in place a phone in order and now it's going to be another 45+ minutes!?!?!?!!?  I'm already almost there.

The next week, exact same issue but I was still at the office trying to call the order in at 5pm.  Called, was put on hold, sat there for 6 minutes.  Picked up my office phone, called and guess what, the phone was answered an my order taken, YET I WAS STILL ON HOLD ON MY CELL PHONE.  I left my office and stayed on hold on my cell phone to see just how long I'd be on hold and guess what?  I walked into the restaurant 28 minutes later and I was STILL ON HOLD on my cell phone!

This past Friday (8/28/13) called and  WAS PUT ON HOLD.  Sat on hold 5 minutes, called back, the phone was busy on 3 attempts, called and got put on hold again for 6 minutes,  Hung up, called back, was put on hold 8 minutes.  When a male finally answered the phone, I was at the 51 and Greenway I asked how long for a pizza, he lied and said 15 minutes - REALLY????  Sure, I'm going to be there in 10 and wait for 45 so I told him what happened and said no I'm not ordering a pizza, and told him that they need to get their to-go order phone lines in order before I ever try to go back.  He offered no apology and seemed like he didn't even care.

I called Barros in North Phoenix and guess what - they answered, took my order and I went, picked it up and was happy as a clam!  Their boneless wings are better and it was a nice break from the mental torture of the whole phone order process with Rosatis on Bell Road.

Rosatis, you've lost my business over something so simple as a phone call - bad business and your Owner/ Manager, if not aware of this issue, better fix this problem unless your phone order customer base doesn't matter to the bottom line.  Something tells me, it does and will."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online and have usually used them before without problems. On this occasion however I accidentally placed an order with an error. Realizing this immediately I called them to fix said error and they couldn't find my order. After a long and pointless phone call I was told to call back and see if the order had appeared by then, which was only 5 minutes. To my surprise and disappointment the pizza was already out on delivery, and wrong, which I had tried to prevent. The manager said he would return-send the correct pizza which was awesome on his part and to send the driver back with the messed up one. The new pizza came back pretty quickly but was incorrect exactly the same as first and to top it off the owner was the delivery driver and complained about how ridiculous this was. If y'all had competent people working there when I had called first off then there wouldn't have been and issue also resending the exactly same pizza again really confuses me. All in all very disappointed since this place is way over priced. Usually decent pizza but not worth it after this experience."}
{"text":"First time here and impressed with service and food. Will be back. This place has my business  for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered at 6p for delivery to my hotel. Estimated 50 minutes to deliver and the driver was there in just about that time, problem is he had the wrong pizza. 

He was very apologetic and took it back and said he would be back as quick as he could. It took him roughly an hour and ten minutes to return. Not exactly how I would handle a mistake that is 100% their fault. 

Mind you 1/2 my food was left behind so dinner was split. 

Now on to the pizza, it was ok, I guess.  The thin crust was  good, sauce was heavy and inconsistent, cheese was good. I did not like the spices on top after cooking. Just my personal preference. 

Price was high. $29 (including tip) for 14\" cheese pizza, French fries (they were ok for delivery), and a 2L Coke. 

Driver was nice enough to offer a 20% discount on my next order that I will likely by take advantage of."}
{"text":"The pizza was super good, but the wings are pretty bad. I got the medium crust, I forget the name, maybe double dough, and it was absolutely amazing. I was super upset that there was not an area to eat there, and it is strictly take out. I would have never eaten there had I known that, but it was still very good."}
{"text":"Eh.. It's ok.. Pizza is better than the fast food chains but it's nowhere near amazing.. Side dishes are hot and taste ok.. Typical neighborhood pizza joint.."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza around,without a doubt! Yes,they have made mistakes on my order,only on the weekend. But they are really that good that it doesn't matter! I order here at least four days a week! The management is over the top! I had a small complaint about my order he made it right 10√ó ! They are really cool people and truly care that there delivering the best product for each customer. I will eat here for the rest of my life and probably more! Did I mention the have the best food ever! Go eat here now!"}
{"text":"A friend gave us a gift card for Christmas for this location of Rosati's Pizza.  We tried to use it tonight.  Well guess what?  They won't honor it!!!!!!!  Whatever you do, do NOT get a gift card from this place.  We have been long time fans of Rosati's Pizza, but no more.  They are definitely messed up."}
{"text":"Italian style pizza a little different from your average pizza. Great quality service from everyone I've seen delivering to the hotel I worked at and all the guests were pleased with the food quality!"}
{"text":"My review is just about the Pizza. No problem with the service at all! I also did not try their pasta, which I might some day. In which case, I'll update the review. 

The pizza is pretty underwhelming. I've read several reviews that say it's just inconsistent so maybe I got them on a bad night. The pizza wasn't terrible, it was edible, it was just underwhelming. I don't think I would pay $10 for that pizza, let alone over $15, which is what I did pay. I believe you'll find better value for your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just ordered an extra large monster pizza for my employees....everyone loved it. So rich and decadent!

The order process was smooth and painless, and the owner is awesome.

Definitely a local business that should be supported. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We have dined in twice with exceptional service and food.  The atmosphere is fantastic to watch a game, yet family friendly.  Service was fast and incredibly friendly. Today, we decided for delivery and Pablo was so courteous on the phone.  Food was excellent and we will continue to frequent this Rosati's for dine in and delivery."}
{"text":"Okay I was a little disappointed with this new delivery pizza chicken wing place I just ordered some chicken wings and fried pickles I asked for a menu because it was my first time ordering from this place and they forgot it they didn't bring the sauce for my chicken wings and the food was just okay not sure if I'll try them again"}
{"text":"This place went to messy and unkept to super clean and inviting. New ownership has made a big difference. You should give it another shot. We haven't eaten here in a couple years and very happy it's under new ownership. They have Great pizza and salads to chose from."}
{"text":"Have ordered from this location about 10 times now, always trying to give them another chance as my boyfriend is a Chicago native and we want to be supportive of the business. EVERY SINGLE ORDER has been delivered incorrectly, with little to no effort to fix it. Will not be ordering from Rosati's again."}
{"text":"My wife phoned in an order for 2 pizzas with a money mailer coupon for 14.99. When I went to pick up the total amount was $43.42 and the manager said they would not take the coupon. . Very deceptive advertising and poor service. . Will not go here again."}
{"text":"Never trust a place on where 95% of the photos on Yelp were taken by the business owner."}
{"text":"Pizza bomb. Pizza boy at the front desk not too bad of a sight to look at while I waited for my pizza ;) always find myself at this place"}
{"text":"Placed on hold for 10 min. Second time in 3 days. I will go somewhere else! Used to be a favorite place of mine."}
{"text":"Very limited inside seating. Two tables and 3 tables in front. One of the outside tables is wobbly. No restrooms. Will make fresh slices but it takes almost 15 minutes. Bold Barley Brewery inside, usually has 3+ beers on tap. Can't beat the price: slice + beer = $7"}
{"text":"Mmm! Pizza! We were looking for a good pizza place in Vegas on Yelp and came across Rosati's since it was nearby. We bought their Double Dough Pizza with Pepperoni and Mushrooms for pick up and it was ready in a flash. Opened the pizza box up when we got home and BAM! a very huge pizza with very huge crusts. The crust was super good. Actually the Double Dough Pizza literally felt like there were two pizza slices in one so I was full off of a slice. The tomato sauce was really light and there was lots of cheese. The prices were decent and the service was friendly. I was so full from one slice that I had a food coma after."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food, especially their lunch specials (good on weekends too), closest to the Italian beef that in used to in Chicago, no one else that I've found in madison can get it right. 

I love their thin crust pizza, never tried the Chicago style because I'll go to Chicago if I want it.  The menu coupons make it a pretty good deal too...

It seems that other reviewers ordered thin crust and expected a deep dish..."}
{"text":"Crust taste like a saltine cracker, sauce is just as flavorless. My dog wouldn't even eat it. You're better off buying a frozen pizza. Don't waste your money. $22 for 14\" of crap."}
{"text":"NEW OWNERS....Better then before. 

We had a large pizza, wings and dessert. 

The pizza was awesome, great the crust was chewy and had a good taste. 
There was flavor to the sauce (unlike Sardellas)
And plenty of cheese. 
This is a filling type of pizza not a \"Hot and ready eat 8 slices by yourself.\" 
The wings were good too. Not too hot not to mild.  

They have updated the seating and the interior as well. They now fit 12 people or so. You can go there for lunch now. LOL

It can get expensive but it is worth every penny. I am glad we went back. 

Also the owner (I assumed) was very plesant and actually spoke to us (daughter too) LOL"}
{"text":"We had just moved into our new place and after a hot summer stressful move all we could think about was food. So we decided to order delivery from here. The lady who first answered the phone was extremely rude!! She rushed our service and made everything more irritating. When we asked questions she would say did you not see a menu. Once we got our food it was actually pretty good. But once someone makes your day worse then it was it doesn't even matter it is more like forced food haha. I will never order from here again. If you want to be rushed and feel like a fool this would be the place to order from. Rather get little Caesars pizza they are a lot friendlier. Food not so great, but over all you will be happier. Hope they change there service people or they will lose so many potential customers. Overall. Great food. Horrible employees."}
{"text":"For some time now I had been thinking of checking out Rosati's at this location. I have never been to a Rosati's and my friends and family discouraged me because they would say things like \"Grimaldi pizza is better\" or Rosati's just does not cut it. 
So last evening I decided to check this out myself. 
I was looking for a sports bar to watch the CAVS play the WARRIORS. 
So I walk in and get a table. The rest is history:
Great service
Great pizza
Great TVs
Excellent ambiance. 
Had a chance to chat with the owner. He and his wife run this place. Kudos. I love it when young entrepreneurs take risks to make it big. 
Overall: I will be back and will tell my friends and family to check this place out. 
All the best to this young entrepreneurial couple!"}
{"text":"Today I tried ordering for delivery and the girl on phone said they never delivered outside of a 5 mile radius and they had no history of my address. (I checked on google and I'm about 4.8 miles away and I've been ordering from them for years.) My boyfriend called back from a phone number that they would be more likely to recognize and they told him the same thing and hung up on him. Now I'm just disappointed because this was one of my favorite restaurants to get delivery from. Great way to treat your regular customers, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed low key atmosphere.  Wish they had a patio.  Very friendly owners (husband and wife).  Decent service, good pizza.  Staff should toss the cesar salads before serving though.  We will be back"}
{"text":"The pizza there is amazing nice dough and the do use alot of cheese and fresh ingrediants ."}
{"text":"This restaurant puts flyer on door offering delivery and when you call to order dinner they say you're 1/2 mile out of their delivery range haha!!. Not good business move."}
{"text":"The burgers are horrid. Overlooked and dry. Fries were cold. Bad experience won't do it again"}
{"text":"Ask for Danny! He's so cool! Really tasty crispy gluten free crust. They have a program running right now to feed hungry kids too. Love that! When we came in we got treated like family. They use awesome ingredients and they don't skimp! Not much else to say! Another day in pizza paradise."}
{"text":"Good eats here pizza is yummy and fresh n hot!!"}
{"text":"Update: James father, the owner had given me a phone call this evening then explained to me his son was having a bad night, also made mention of the fact that they try their best to accommodate customers that are further out from their normal delivery radius. I tip my hat for him to call me, I will bump my review to three stars. 


I called this evening 95 minutes before the store closed to order a meal. I was answered by a gentleman named James. When I went to put my order in he said he would not take the order because it's close to closing. I told him that the store closed in 95 minutes and he said \"you're 12 Miles away, come pick it up\" I told him I did not want to pick it up. And I asked him if I was to order online directly through Yelp if he would take the order, he said he would not. I mentioned to him I had ordered multiple times at this time of night and he basically told me I did not. He then frustratingly asked me \"ok, what do you want?\" I told him I thin crust pepperoni. He sighed and said that's even worse. I told him I would contact corporate. He said his name is James and he owns the franchise. This is definitely not the type of service I would expect from the owner of any franchise. I will not be ordering any food at this location or any other location in the future. This is not how someone should be serviced when there are multiple options for take out."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Rosati's since they opened. Very good consistent pizza. Love their Chicago style deep dish or even Rosati's style if I wanna go light on tomato. 

I knocked off one star due to their pricing as the pizza can get very expensive and they rarely have coupons and they do not accept other Rosati's coupons. 

Also, their lunch buffet could have more variety for the pizza choices but its a good price!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. This location is under new ownership and I really wanted to support local business. I have been ordering from this store for a couple years and have a standard order. Pizza, wings, and a salad. Nothing special. Nothing special at all last night. Granted it was the NBA playoffs so it was a busy night. The order came in a reasonable amount of time so service was as always good. The disappointment came when we tasted the food. The new owners must have changed vendors because the crust was like a thick layer of cardboard. The anti pasta salad was a bowl of lettuce and the wings were just bad. Ended up throwing it all away.   I understand the learning curve of a new business and will try Rosati's again in


Tried again  and boy am I glad I did. Two wonder pies, great salad and wings that were perfect. Great local spot."}
{"text":"So as many of you know there are a few Rosati's in town here and I've been to a few.  Some differences would be the service, the atmosphere, the layout, and the quality of food.  My choice would be the one off Ann and Losee for the pure fact that the magician aka head chef in the back has a trick up his sleeve when it comes to prepping the dough.  If you didn't know all the Rosati's here in town receive the same flour, sauce, etc but prepping the dough is up to the kitchen staff.  Although the pizza is similar at all locations with slight menu variances, the pizza on Losee is hands down the top!  Also, the owner is super friendly and prior Army so thanks for your service to my friend!  And the waitresses are super friendly and have personality.  Kuddos to my favorite girls Ashleigh and Sarah for taking care of me when I'm there and also when I do delivery.  Also to the manager Sheryl for running a tight ship and gettin it done!!!"}
{"text":"It may not quite be as good as what Chicago has to offer, but it comes pretty close.  I always crave Rosati's when I come to the area and they have a good deal they always seem to run where you get one large stuffed crust you get a regular thin crust.  It's always delicious and great to share with my family members in the area."}
{"text":"Well I have to put an x through another Chicago pizza place who tried moving to Arizona. Rosati's was great the first time I had a pizza but the last two attempts were awful at best. Over sauced and Way undercooked pizza is the worst.

Wow, I finally found a great pizza place, I have been in Arizona for 6 months. Rosati's is no stranger to me since I was born and raised in the Chicago area. I have tried so many places claiming to be the best no way they can compete with the friendly staff and quality product for a great price. 

Thank you, from making me totally home sick for some really great pizza you knocked it out of the park.

Best of luck to you, but I have a good feeling you won't need any luck."}
{"text":"Love the local feel and great pizza!  The wings are bomb!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot to get a slice and wings. The service was good and the food was good. I really liked the wings. The pizza by the slice was as expected. I'm not super picky but I had no complaints."}
{"text":"We ordered about $60 for delivery.  Deep dish pizza was delicious as well as the wings and cheesy bread however they forgot the deep fried cauliflower.  When I called to let them know, the employee said they were sorry for the \"mis-convenience\" and next time I ordered to mention this \"mis-convenience\" and the new order would be credited.  Suffice it to say, there will not be any future orders.  Too bad, I really liked this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. But its over priced. We go here when our regular pizza place is closed."}
{"text":"My husband used to be regulars of Amore's here on Durango, but in the past year
the food has just gone down hill. We came here and the Deep Dish is awesome, taste just like Giordano's.  This pizza had good flavor, good amount of sauce and toppings. Had our favorite waitress Rosemarie(ex Amore). Such hard worker and
great server. Rosati's is blessed to have her.  The food is so good here, and is
our new Pizza Place here in Vegas.  Once you try here, you won't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered a bbq chicken deep dish and thin crust pizza for an office event. Both pies met the mark. The bbq pizza was a bit twangy and not as good as the last time I had tried it. Needless to say I hadn't paid for it the last time,  food tends to taste better that way.

Overall if you are looking for solid pizza and come have east coast roots like me this may be your best shot at acquiring some sort of Deja Vu."}
{"text":"We have watched this place go downhill in the last year. It was n ok pizza and salad lunch Buffett but today breaks the straw. The place was a pig pen, just an absolute disaster. We figured that the place was swamped before we got there then we find out it just opened and they didn't clean from the night before. I swear to you that dirty dinners will be shooting at this place soon. I am currently typing this rant from the bathroom where I have been three times since lunch two and a half hours ago. Never again."}
{"text":"bad experience. took over an hour for a small pizza. was cold, hardly covered with any cheese."}
{"text":"Last Monday I decided to finally hang it up. After ordering here for about 4 years and the majority of the times being disappointed, I'm going elsewhere. The last 3 orders have taken their toll. On Monday my 14 inch medium pizza cost me $32.00. Between the price of the pizza and the driver not having change I went broke. The 2 prior orders either my pizza arrived cold or I did not get the extra chz & sauce for which I had paid for. Little Chicago here I come...."}
{"text":"Update!! Talked to Rosati owner of the Power/Thomas location. He informed me he just bought 3 locations as of the week of Dec 12th. He bought the Greenfield, Crimson, & Val Vista locations. This is great news! Now we don't have to worry about poor customer service and still able to enjoy a Rosati pizza whenever we want to....not as before, when the previous owner decided he would work. All 4 locations are owned & operated by a husband & wife team. They even caterered our company Christmas party on Friday (12/16) with less than a 24 hr notice! Great job!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a pizza a sub and some onion rings from there. I will not order anything from them again, especially delivery. I asked for the sub be cut, nope. I asked that the onions rings be well done, out of the 9 I got, 2 were burnt pieces, no onions in them, the other 7 were soggy and not even close to being done, that was a waste of $4.50 for 9 onion rings. I asked that the pizza be well done. It was not, dough was not done in the middle...... Pretty much a waste I did eat the sub, because I was starving. It was tasty, but small for $8.00. This is the only reason they got any stars.I even tried calling the phone number on the rcpt, just kept ringing, no answer. Thus they lose a star. What a waste of 40 dollars and time."}
{"text":"What is it with this neighborhood? Every pizza place around here has horrible pizza. Thin crust means a delicious crust that's thinner than the regular crust. It doesn't mean a huge dry cracker. Any Italian worth her heritage wouldn't even walk on the same block as this Rosati's. Definition of Rosati's pizza:  cardboard crust, pasty sauce, and something beige that barely resembles cheese. They don't even know how to cut the thing. It's supposed be cut in wedges. The thing I brought home looked like a tic tac toe board. Ugh. So disappointing for someone who just moved into the hood."}
{"text":"Honestly this is some of the best pizza I've had in a long time.  They don't skimp out on the sauce or the toppings and the pizza was flavorful.  I had the Hawaiian Pizza.  This pizza was better than your typical pizza.  I ordered the dough brownie was delicious and very sweet.  I'm definitely going to order from here again."}
{"text":"Good pizza, pasta, and wings, but if we have a next trip we'll avoid any pizza using spinach as a topping. The waterlogged frozen/canned spinach very nearly ruined our perfectly acceptable thin crust pizza.
The server was super friendly and on the ball even though she was running the cash register, packing up take-out orders, and waiting the entire (tiny) place."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt one of my favorite pizza places. Ever since I found them I can't stop ordering. There's no other pizza place that makes a pizza and gives a pizza like Rosati's. The pizza is fresh hot and right on time when delivered. 
I know I need to see what else they may have on the menu and I'm sure it's just as excellent as the pizza but when it's takeout time PIZZA is all I have on the brain and Rosati's is the place."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have believed it had I not experienced it firsthand, but I've found a place that makes better lasagna and pasta sauce than me. I figured the pasta dishes were single-serving, and technically speaking, what I got last night *was* a single serving (as in, I ate the whole thing - lasagna, salad, and garlic bread) while sitting at the outdoor table, but 20 hours later, I'm still full. Eventually, I'll waddle back to try the pizza and other dishes (BBQ ribs, in an Italian take-out joint? ooookay...).

I was a bit put out by the absence of calzone on the menu, but the order-taker-guy said they were considering adding them. The salad had a slightly odd taste, most likely caused by being rinsed in the Valley's notoriously horrible water. Otherwise, I'm definitely hooked."}
{"text":"Great thin crust Chicago Pizza. Easy online ordering and timely delivery. Hard to find authentic thin crust pizza around here. Try it you'll love it."}
{"text":"As a Chicagoan,  it is extremely hard to find good pizza. Rosati's definitely has good thin crust pizza...however the service is awful! We have eaten here on a Friday night when it was semi-busy and we waited quite a long time for our food. We got our appetizer with our food which defeated the purpose of ordering an appetizer. 

We tried it on a Sunday afternoon when we were the absolute only customers in the restaurant, and still waited...and waited...it took us over an hour to dine in with a simple order of fried mushrooms and a large pizza. 

My suggestion is order take-out!!"}
{"text":"Sorry for the long review, but this has to be known....

If I could have given this location a negative score, I would have!  I live close by but wanted to call in the order & go pick it up. This would have been my 1st time eating/ordering at Rosatis. I called around 6pm on a Sunday.  The phone rang about 3-4 times then went into a instant hold recording. ( talking about their great service... yeah right)  After about 5 minutes on hold & no one picking up to say ill be right with you, i of course started to wonder what was going on.  My husband picked up his cell & called the same number to see if maybe my call was lost in que or something.  Nope same thing, 5 min of hold on his phone, meanwhile 10 min on mine.
  At this point i decided to just go straight to the location, but decided to stay on the phone to see if somene would pick up.  By the time i got to the store, my phone had read 23 minutes on HOLD!!   Are you serious?!

I walked into the store & immediately asked for a manager.  This is the most appaling part to me...
The guy was already at the counter & said im the manager how can i help you.  I proceeded to show him my phone & said that ive been on hold this entire time trying to get through.  He saw the 23 min & heard it, because i then put it on speaker.  He acted so dumbfounded.  He said i dont know how that can happen? Meanwhile one of the servers came up to the counter & said in her 17 yr old voice, i dont know how thats possible.  The phone should hang up after 5 min of holding. (Thats not a good thing either rosatis)

  I tell them this is my 1st time here & I cant believe this is how the establshment is run. The server ( not the manager)  is now \"handling the situation\" while the manager just stands there.  She is now giving me attiude & telling me that it was just really busy & i just missed it.  Look at this she says, kind of gesturing with her hands to look at the mess on the counter.  I said im sorry, but thats not really my concern.  I asked why no one could pick up the phone to say, hey were really busy but ill be with you in a few minutes?  Her response was that the phone goes into a que & your call gets picked up in the order it comes in.  Ok i say, but 23 minutes??

Finally the girl with purple hair who is supposed to be answering the phone ( who by the way hasnt said a thing) starts hitting buttons to see \"where my call is\" and BINGO! low & behold she picks up!  Well all 3 of them looked shocked.  I looked at the manager & he was like yeah sorry, I dont know how that happened but weve been really busy.  I said im sorry but thats none of my concern, wating for some sort of apology or some effort to make the situation right.

The server says well mam, what do you want? I said nothing now!  She said good then you can just leave, we dont need your percentage anyway! Holly Cow, really?  Your telling an 8 month pregnant (with twins) woman to get out? Just LEAVE she says.
 I looked to the manager, like are you going to let this girl talk to me like this?  He went right along with it.  
I asked her for her name & she just shrugged.  I ask the manager for his name & he says in his cocky tone TONY.  Almost like he was giving me some random name? who knows....
Bottom line is that this place has the-
 
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE & RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT !!!!!!!  

I understand its a pizza joint, but its a huge franchise & yes darling, while you may just be a little peon server, the owners of Rosatis rely on our business & our reviews.  I have already put a call into the corporate office.  This whole thing could have been avoided if they just would have apoligized, but instaed they kicked me out...."}
{"text":"The best pizza around. I also got the cheef sandwich and it was just as tasty! I will be reordering from them. Good delivery time too... Didn't take as long as they quoted!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza last night for dinner from www.myrosatis.com... Other than the young girl on the phone that didn't know her streets well the service and food was excellent ! 
We had a 16 inch deep dish pepperoni and sausage pizza, we received the pizza on time and hot & fresh ... It's so nice to get pizza delivered that good!  I would recommend getting some for yourself"}
{"text":"the environment of the place may be deceiving but it is some of the BEST PIZZA, the deep dish, the calzones, and the thin crust are all amazing"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, and I really like that it arrives piping hot!  
I had it with anchovies ( not every one favorite topping:)and mushrooms or just with sausage. I have only tried the thin original crust, which is crispy and just a little chewy. Sauce is flavorful and the sausage was great quality. Is not cheap though, but worth it.Check your mail as they send out coupons from time to time."}
{"text":"I ordered a basic baked lasagna with marinara and a side salad with ranch. The side salad was fine but they didn't chop it up like I asked. My ranch was also warm and they took an hour and 15 minutes to get here. People are very nice over the phone and in person. My lasagne tasted incredibly salty and looked very strange. The sauce almost resembled chili and the lasagna was drowning in it. Every Rosatis I go to is always hit or miss and incredibly inconsistent. From Glendale to Chandler to Surprise, it either is great or just absolutely amateur. Take a guess what this one was...."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza, my favorite in town. Love the double crust pepperoni!!!  Nice to have a pizza place in town that still uses fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN! The best pizza I have had in the valley. My husband and I have tried so many pizzerias but are never satisfied. When I brought home Rosatie's tonight my whole family loved it (which is rare). The flavor was insane, the thin crust was to die for, all of the ingredients were so fresh and I totally recommend the hand made breadsticks! Yum!"}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native, I think this is the best pizza AZ has to offer, or at least of what I've tried.  They are a staple for me and I hope there is a franchise on the west side too!"}
{"text":"Pizza below average, service and management bad.

Ordered a thin crust sausage pizza and the flavor was lackluster to say the least. The dough did not seem as if it was cooked all the way. The sausage was alright, but the chewy dough didn't help the overall flavor. Also, when I bit down into my pizza, I bit into a piece of plastic. I informed the girl at the register about this plastic, and her response was just \"i'm sorry\". Not getting the manager and no show of concern. The overall lack of concern regarding that fact that I just bit into a large (about 2 square inch) piece of plastic perplexed me. I am usually a Rosati's fan, but not of this location."}
{"text":"I had never had Chicago style pizza before. It is AMAZING! I don't think I can go back to \"regular\" pizza after having Rosati's deep dish! I didn't try anything else because the deep dish is so filling, but the customer service at this particular location was great! Considering I had never been there before, the staff was very helpful."}
{"text":"Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the \"Mozzarella Sticks\" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium \"Chicago Style Pizza\" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. 

They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm."}
{"text":"Had to Go into order a pizza to go because the website will not recognize the zip code. Place my pizza order to go tell them that I will wait in back and have a beer. Was informed that I can't have a beer unless I'm eating there or I have an appetizer in front of me. What is that?? The pizza is good but not that good i'm sure as hell not going to order an appetizer. Stupid rule especially In Las Vegas. Sell me the beer and let me wait for my pizza"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent pizza. Would recommend the wings and knots as well. Generally quick service, depends on the night. 

I have regularly ordered delivery from this place but haven't gone into the actual restaurant, so I have no feedback on the interior.

Overall, very enjoyable."}
{"text":"First off, Rosati's pizza is one of my favorite pizza places in the Valley.  The problem is with THIS location.  I believe this is a franchised location that should not be allowed to call themselves Rosati's.  The versions I have had in both North Scottsdale and in Tempe are always very tasty.  The pizza they serve out of this location is almost always disappointing.  

I lived right next to this location for a couple years and tried it at least 4 times hoping it was just a fluke.  It just doesn't taste as good as the other locations, though they still charge the premium Rosati's prices."}
{"text":"Very good food, and lots of it...one of the best I have had in some times...little pricey but u get great good so it kinda makes up for it..it's a milestone do again. .thank u"}
{"text":"Great pizza just moved out here from Chicago. This being right down the block is great. Foods awesome and staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place and it was fine, but nothing I would ever go out of my way for again.  For the groupon price the pizza tasted just fine, but when I looked at the original receipt before discount the price was $48!!!  This pizza is not worth that at all, a smidgen above chain joints but nothing to deserve the 2x up-charge.  When we pulled up we thought it was closed because there was no one there!  Still trying to figure out why they kept putting me on hold when they were not busy :)"}
{"text":"Where to begin.......I have heard from many people that Rosati's pizza is amazing and how I HAVE TO TRY IT! So I figured I would walk in and check it out. While looking over the menu I asked to use the restroom because......well I had to go. While in the restroom I hear a loud bang and someone yell \"Lets go\" so I finish up, and walk out only to see nobody outside the restroom. I go back to looking over the menu for about 5 to 10 more minutes and decided was a little out off my price range to dine alone and that I'll probably return with some friends so I walked out. As I'm walking away one of the employees follows me outside and yells \"Hey were not a restroom, don't come back\" I turned around and said \"excuse me?\" And he replied\" WERE NOT A F****** RESTROOM!\" So I responded \"I know you're restaurant is not a restroom and you don't need to be so f****** rude\" and I went to the restaurant next door.while waiting for my food there I realize I left my bag from Walgreens in Rosattis so I walked back in and asked the waitress if anyone had seen it... she said kind of nervously that \"he\" has is (referring to the guy who yelled at me) so I turn around and and see him walk inside and I ask him where my bag is and he tells me it's in the trash. Not only did he throw it away,but he purposely walked outside and threw my bag in the dumpster forcing me to climb in the trash and look for my bag. He must. Have thrown it really hard too because my phone was in the bag and it was completely ruined. I really hope this guy was fired because everything that took place was 110% unacceptable. I'm thinking about pressing charges but I don't know if it's even worth the time. I didn't catch his name but he clearly has some anger issues possibly caused by the steroids he has been taking. As amazing as their food may be....I do not plan on eating here and if I talk to anyone about this place I will advise them to do the same. This really was a terrible end to a great week."}
{"text":"Worst pizza crust ever. Should have just eaten the cardboard box. It had no flavor and was soggy. What a disappointment when you are hungry. Will never go back!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. If there was an option to give zero stars I would. I called on a Saturday night at 7 pm, ordered online and was sent an email stating that it would be 45-60 minutes. Well when the 60 minute mark passed I decided to wait and called around 8:25 to see how long til the pizza would arrive. The man on the phone said there were no deliveries there so it must have went out already. So he went and checked and said she just left and would arrive in 5-10 minutes. So I give it some time and called back around 9pm. Once again I get the gentleman that could care less about his job. He tells me she had three deliveries and it is very busy. Now I understand that they could have been very busy but 2 hrs for a pizza was getting a little ridiculous. So I asked if I could cancel my order and he said well she is already on her way but he would try to call her. So I asked are you sure she is on her way? And he said yes. So I said ok i will just wait for the pizza and pray it gets here. And after him not really caring whether I was mad or not I asked to speak to the manager, well guess what he is the assistant manager there and the one delivering my pizza was his boss. So when something does go wrong apparently nothing is done about it. Well after all of that our pizza never got delivered and I also have not been refunded. I have also contacted corporate on Monday and it's now Thursday and I haven't heard anything back from this location yet. 

Tip: if you are going to order from them make sure you are paying in cash and not prepay online."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  This was my first time here and the food is grub!!  Sandwiches here are huge and is less than $8.00.  best bang for your buck!.  Be warned that these are no average subway sandwiches.  These will feed you lunch and dinner.  I got the beef and italian sausage sandwich which was really heavy and delicious.   Good Stuff!."}
{"text":"Like a pathetic dive bar you see on Bar Rescue.  Advertised as a Chicago bar.  Cubs are playing but not on.  Not a lot of TVs.  Should have just ordered instead of coming here.  Needs help."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the deep dish pizza and as a New Yorker it's a little hard to say but it was really good.  Also had chicken wings and fingers and they were just as good.  We will be back many times to come!"}
{"text":"Fave spot for wings and pizza. I would reccomend trying the wings with a side of ranch  and a pepperoni with mushroom and ectta cheese pizza...on point! Customer service is GREAT, delivery is quick and food is hot !!
5 starts all around"}
{"text":"When this location first opened I would have given it 4 stars as the service was great and the food was good but since it's opening and a overhaul in staff who have trouble reading English, we have had take out orders promised in 20 min be an hour. Undercooked pizza with doughy crust on the thin crust. I also have to say that both my wife and I have become ill after eating takeout. I would say maybe other locations may provide better service who know how to cook pizza and wings but this location has been a disappointment."}
{"text":"Since this location went under new ownership it changed for the worst. Final straw will never be back after tonight's experience we put in our order after waiting for 26 minutes we were notified that they were out of eggplant Parmesan so ordered angel hair with marinara waitress came back 15 minutes later to tell us they were out of angel hair pasta and while still waiting for deep dish pizza for over an hour. Ridiculous wait time for food and lack of food ingredients for menu constitutes poor service. Too bad yelp requires 1 Star because I would not even give them anything. This business needs to do major changes to keep the business of the prior owners success. So sad!"}
{"text":"I always have the tough choice of Buon Gusto, Windy City and Rosati's. They're all about 2 miles apart.  But I wouldn't throw out 4 stars to mediocre pizza. This is great pizza. I am spoiled having such great pizza so close to home."}
{"text":"Chicago-style pizza, pastas, and other Italian comfort foods. Really good beef sandwich and Monster Pizza. A step above most chain pizza places. 

Another thing to note about Rosati's is the service (at least at this location). Twice when I had a (small) problem with my order, they were very eager to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"We just moved less than a mile away from this location. We ordered a 16\" mushroom thin crust and some boneless wings. The pizza barely had any sauce on it. I could see the crust in some areas. It didnt have hardly any cheese on it either. The crust tasted like a frozen pizza and looked to be frozen/pre made. The wings were flimsy like they were hours old too. Very disappointing since this is the closest pizza place near us and our new home. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"We always orders the Chicago style pizza and loved it but tonight I ordered the thin crust and was very happy with it. I picked up the pizza at the new location and it looks like they have  a great seating area"}
{"text":"This place is terrible, the pizza sucks, the ribs are good but over priced and no longer includes fries and coleslaw (a la Carte ribs for full price of meal)..without notifying the customer about the change. Way over priced for shitty food, and Courtney at the front desk lacks the skills to be accommodating to customers through her management. This location is a petty, \"nickel and dime\" you type of \"business\". I hope this is not how the whole franchise operates because bankruptcy is clearly imminent."}
{"text":"This store has no idea what hygiene is or how to run as management. 
I ordered cheese and pepperoni. I pulled from the middle pieces and out comes a spinach stem. Oh and that spinach stem? It had a hair WRAPPED around it. Yum. My favorite. 
The manager asked me if I wanted another pizza delivered. Is that a joke? Who knows what's going to be in that one. 
Do yourself a favor, stay at home and make some Mac n cheese. Forget you, Rosatis. Hire a better staff!"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago this is a taste of home. The food is great and they deliever quick, fast and in a hurry."}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni half veggie. Good amount of veggies barley any pepperoni, good cheese but dough and sauce definitely  needs more season. I felt like I was eating just because it looked good and I was hungry. I don't know if I want to go back and risk it."}
{"text":"New favorite pizza in Vegas. Love this place. Can't recommend enough their unique style of pizza. Worth the premium you pay over others."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and normally the food is okay, passable and the delivery is fast.  Today they took an hour and a half to arrive, forgot half the order, and the food was awful.  The ribs were tough and overcooked, besides looking gray on the bone.  The cheese sticks and fries were so soggy and gross I'm putting them in the oven to even eat them.  I will never order from here again, and when the driver returns he will be taking the ribs with him.  More sauce does not a good meal make."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever!!! Had home delivery of Large Chicago Style and Veggie pizzas from Scottsdale..I miss Pizzeria Unos...Papa John's still d best.. in Sedona, Moondog's d Best.."}
{"text":"I ordered take out online after receiving a coupon for Rosati's, the coupon stated, \"2 regular size dinners for $14.99\" and \"Must present coupon when ordering\" there wasn't a coupon code on it so I added a note in the special instructions area. When I picked up my food, the employee was rude and refused the coupon because I didn't call in the order. This was my first and will be my last time ordering from Rosati's. They need better service and communication. We are new to the neighborhood and they did not welcome us."}
{"text":"When did a medium 3 topping pizza delivered get to be $35.00?????
We could have had two steak dinners at Texas Roadhouse for $22.00!!
Pizza was average at best but had really good sauce. Toppings were not edge to edge so the only really good pieces were in the center. Had pizza delivered and it arrived only slightly warm.  Delivery driver was super friendly."}
{"text":"Best Chicago Pizza in the Valley... We wouldn't have it any other way. I have been in the Valley over ten years and have try'd them all it seems like. I still prefer Rosati's any day of the week.

Thanks for being a great location and great service as well as delivery. See you next time for another \"Monster Pie\""}
{"text":"As previously mentioned, that fettuccini carbonara is bangin'!!! Did they cook bacon and 'shrooms into the sauce and then sprinkle additional bacon only to top the thing with entire strips of bacon!!! Um, yes. That's what they did. It was phenomenal. As was the chicago dog, crinkly fries and greek salad. 

Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"We love the food. Food is delicious. However the service in the restaurant is consistently poor. Even when there are 6 people in the restaurant they can't seem to handle a simple food/drink order. Order take out but don't come in."}
{"text":"In my opinion, This location is not as good as the others. The staff was not very friendly and there was an odd smell in the lobby. Pizza was close to the other locations, but it was really crumbly on the bottom. Overall, it was a lot of money for a sub par pizza experience. Most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"We had been a fan of this Rosati's for years, and there was a period of time when we would make a trip weekly. I'm not sure what changed. The last time we went we were less than impressed, but when we went this time, I would rank it as disappointing. We ordered two thin crust pizzas, which took over 25 minutes to come out. When they did, 'thin crust' was the thickness and texture of corrugated cardboard. The toppings did not particularly jump out at me as having much taste either, so I doubt that the veggies were that fresh. 

The booth seats are in horrible shape, very much in need of replacement, and the restrooms were dark, dank, and none too clean. Add to that a very slow table service, as the wait staff was hanging around chatting rather than minding their tables, and one hour later we escaped, possibly to never come back."}
{"text":"Once again Rosati's does not disappoint. Again my Mom needed food...She is sick and can not drive. I live in California but they make it easy for me to order pizza for my Mom and get her what she needs while she is sick. Thanks guys. Really is amazing."}
{"text":"So here's the deal. Game 7 of the World Series in a Chicago bar and this place only has 1 bartender. She is doing the best she can, but really???!!!
Food is good, but took forever.  
Come on.  Get it together!"}
{"text":"WOW.. The old chick they got working here is           .... You fill in the blank. I like Rosatis Pizza, but not this location.  I can't place my order anymore because I can't get past the b on the phone. I don't know if she's an owner or manger but this place needs a \"Restaurant Impossible\" makeover.  Your in the competitive business of pizza, and failing... DUE TO YOUR ATTITUDE.  But I guess this is a blessing,  since the pizza is soggy, ( Better ask for it well done ) pasta sits in warmer ALL day, and lasagna is microwaved... Everything is just gross. Especially the old lady that is always there.

I suggest Taste of Amore on Durango , nice people, QUALITY food."}
{"text":"This place has the ability to be great, the problem is this location. The last time we ordered the pizza was GROSS! So bad that we vowed, even though we love the pizza(normally), we cannot eat there anymore. We arrived to pick up the pizza(like normal), as we normally carry out. The pizza was already starting to go cold when we go there exactly 20 minutes after the order was placed when the  girl had told us it would take 25 minutes to have it done. Good thing we got there when we did or else  our pizza would have been sitting for another 5  minutes. The pizza itself looked like a drunk person made it. It was cut into huge squares instead of the neatly cut smaller squares that is normally is. That I could live with, however the crust was covered in what seemed like one gallon of pizza sauce making it unbearably soggy because the pizza didn't cook all the way through in the middle. My fiance noticed that they had changed the quality of their sausage from the old good quality authentic, to some new gross bad quality meat. We also noticed that the crust is now the frozen stuff, right out of the freezer and nasty!!!!! It used to be made fresh. We didn't even call them to complain because we didn't even want a free pizza in the future. You can keep your soggy pizza, low-quality ingredients, and high prices."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I'm often too hungry to be patient here, but am never disappointed.
Knowing how good the food is, it's VERY hard to be patient... And some days we've had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. But it was well worth it, I think. Have never been able to finish an order from here (portions are VERY generous)... Great leftovers! Their pasta is amazing and their pizza is one of the best in town.

I've only dined in, never carried out. The dining room isn't huge, but you won't feel like you're suffocating. The lighting is a little dim, and they often have Dean Martin playing in the background. Flat screens at every corner, I believe-- you'll never miss a game or breaking news! Ha!

The service is almost always good. The servers are always very nice.

First time writing a review for this place (and in general), but I will be sure to add any more info if necessary.

Definitely a place to go, any time of the week! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"we ordered pizza from rosati but we're staying at the SpringHill Suites Marriott on Van Buren .  After the first hour wait we called to see why we had not received a pizza . The lady on the phone told us our pizza would be ready in about a half hour they had been swamped. An hour later still no pizza. We called again since it has been 2 hours now. At that time we were informed that if pizza had not been made and that they were crediting back our money. The credit was received however we had no pizza at 830 at night. A phone call earlier would have been nice. I guess we'll never find out if you have good pizza. ..... Don't order here you'll starve waiting.  No stars deserved for ratings"}
{"text":"The manager of this company is awful and undeserving of continued business. His name is Bill and is disrespectful. I ordered 3 consecutive meals, 3 consecutive nights. I ordered 24 buffalo wings and a pizza. The collective cost was roughly $150 dollars. The first night my order was fine. The second night the buffalo wings were so overcooked and bone dry. I had to throw out half of them because it was like eating a leather belt.

Tonight I placed my order with one of the kind ladies at the front desk. Very sweet and pleasant. Due to the fact I had to throw half of my order away last night, I was emphatic with making sure the wings had extra extra hot sauce. That way with the delivery time they wouldn't be dry and gross. If anybody eats chicken wings, they understand this. I even told the young lady to make sure the wings were \"swimming in hot sauce\". We joked and she said I will make sure the cook understands. Spending $150 over 3 days, I assumed this place would appreciate the repeat business. 

The wings came to my door bone dry, shriveled up and nasty. This order cost $60 plus the $5 tip to the driver. I called back in asked what happened. I was told the kitchen got busy and it was a mistake. The kind young lady said she would speak to the manager and see about crediting the wings. She called me back and said the manager wasn't willing to do anything. To bad for me. Meanwhile the 24 wings are in the trash can.  I'm not worried about the $19 cost of the wings. It's the principle of a repeat customer receiving an unacceptable meal, spending a lot of money and the manager basically saying \"tough shit\". I will never order from this place again and the ownership should eliminate staff like this who has no regard for the customer. Go to Nikos pizza. Very kind staff who goes the extra step for the customer."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had! We ordered ONE medium pizza with no cheese and a few vegetable toppings for $27!!! Completely over priced and tasted terrible. The crust was so plain, cold, and crackery. The sauce wasn't the best but nothing would taste good on top of the awful crust. I was so excited to find there was a pizza place near me with vegan crust and I am so disappointed ): . After reading all the bad reviews I can't believe management hasn't done anything to correct their problems."}
{"text":"I used to regularly order from there but the last two times I did the pizza wasn't any good.  It was under cooked again and too doughy.  For the amount of money you spend it's not worth it anymore.  Way to much money for what you get.  It's nothing like a real Chicago Rosati's.  Papa Murphy's is better."}
{"text":"The place is a little hidden off, but its next to subway. I have only been here one time, but I had a horrible experience. First off I decided to this place because of a special promotion courtesy of restaurant.com. Second, I ordered through the phone, and was told 30 minutes @ approx. 7pm. I arrived and paid at 730pm, and paid, they seemed a little busy so I decided to be patient for my order understanding they are a little busy. Its 745pm, and I'm wondering where my food is, the two people that I was ahead of already left with their order. So I ask the lady taking the phone and orders at the front, and then she goes into the heat oven and to my surprise, pulls out my order. 

Okay, so my order was ready and they didn't want to notify me?? I leave without saying anything, but decided to check on the pizza while I was at a stop light in my car. They have a different type of pizza box and when I opened one flap, it was completely soggy and leaked onto my car's chair, leaving a mess. Most definitely unpleasant because I like to be very clean about my car. 

Now to the food.. I ordered mozzarella sticks, some white sauce with penne pasta, and a rosati's monster chicago style. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good, but how can you mess that up? The pasta... nothing to brag about, it was okay. Now the pizza should be renamed the olive monster, that thing was covered in olives. I can't give the pizza any true critique other than it was more wet than Seattle's weather.

I've worked in a few pizzeria's, franchise and local, and never had a gave anyone a situation like this. Perhaps they their food is actually pretty good, just my specific pizza was disastrous, but I'll never know because I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place upon receiving my new 2014 Entertainment Book and finding a coupon and reading some of the reviews on Yelp. I figured the discounted price would make up for any bad service or what have you but I found as many of the more recent reviewers have noted that this place is under new ownership and is completely separate from the other Rosati's now. They do seem to have a few bugs to work out but all of the staff was very friendly and the Pizza was great. The manager on duty (young bald guy) was really cool. The place is geared mostly to take out and delivery but they have a few tables and even brought out the order to us. I would definitely recommend this place and will go back again and would like to try some of their pastas."}
{"text":"Messed up my cheese ravioli when they forgot to add meatballs that I paid for . I called in and they tell me they would give me a 2.00 credit ? To think they would bring the correct order they instead offer me a 2 dollar credit lol. No thank you ! And instead of giving me mozzarella sticks they replace it with dried chicken wings ! Never ever ordering here again !"}
{"text":"Went here to sample the deep dish pizza, and it was excellent! One of the better deep dishes in town, the 12\" runs only 15 bucks plus toppings and feeds 3+. Also had an unspectacular Caesar salad and run-of-the mill hot wings. Good beer specials (domestic bottles 1.50) on Thursday nights. Service was good (even though Melanie was the only server on our visit). I'll return, mainly for that deep dish deliciousness......"}
{"text":"i love their garlic bread and salad, so fresh. It is also good for catering.  We order it for group of 20!people . Most are very happy with it"}
{"text":"Friendly service...delicious Chicago style
Pizza reasonably priced cocktails!  Yes it takes a little longer for Chicago style but they stipulate that on the menu and it's totally worth the wait!  Fantastic sports bar to just hang out and feast!"}
{"text":"Always good!!! All about the double dough pizza.They have great fried mushrooms and zucchini.The chief is great never too greasy.Friendly staff.Fast delivery friendly drivers and food always hot..This is one of the very good Rosati's franchises in las vegas.I would recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"The chief is small and tastes kinda gross the pizza is good..but other locations are better"}
{"text":"Just had ubereats deliver our dinner.  Everything was wonderful.  The dough bites are the best thing I've ever eaten in my life.  So freaking amazing."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. If I could give zero stars I would. My husband and I tried this location because we were in the area on 7.2.16. We walked in, encountered 3 of the staff who never acknowledged our existence. We seated ourselves, and after around 5 minutes, a young lady full of attitude comes over puts 2 cups and silverware on our table without so much as a word spoken. She left. 10 more minutes go by and we were never acknowledged. We see the same \"Hostess\" pass us up, take out her cell phone and go into the bathroom. After almost 10 more minutes we get up and leave. Everyone watch us leave and nobody says anything. They went over to the table and remove the dishes and go back to business as usual. Unbelievable. Such a contrast to the service we receive at the location closest to our home on N Durango."}
{"text":"This Rosatis' restaurant stands out above all the others because they have the best Linguine w/Red Clam Sauce in the East Valley! The Spinach & Tomato Garlic Bread with the side of Marinara dipping sauce is to die for! Attentive,professional customer service."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Sooo  much like the Chicagoland pizza that I love so much.  However, make sure you tell them NOT to put the parm cheese and oregano on it.....it's too overpowering.  Without that parm and herbs, it is the BEST pizza in the East Valley"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new pizza place, and this hit the spot! Initially, I was surprised by how expensive a pizza was, but once I got this 10 lb. behemoth, I began to understand. I wasn't getting your every day corporate chain pizza, I was getting something of true pizza craftsmanship. This was everything I have been wanting in a pizza for over 15 years."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. Same issues with delivery as everyone else and zero attempts at communication. Tons of excuses without apology or solutions."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. We really like Rosati's pizza and are pretty loyal customers. I'd give it a solid 4 stars for food. But the delivery is so awful, I think this will be our last time eating there. Last two deliveries were late and wrong. The second one? Not even an apology. 

And tonight? Quoted 45-60 minutes. At 75 minutes, I called. She said it would be here \"soon.\"  I said, \"At this rate, it will be 20-30 minutes later  than quoted.\" She told me, \"Well, our delivery is at an hour and a half now,\" to which I stated, \"I ordered over an hour ago and that's not what I was quoted.\" She giggled and said, \"well, sorry.\" Had we been quoted 90 minutes for delivery, I would have happily gone down and picked it up earlier. 

So, despite liking the pizza, I think that's it for us. We're not looking for anything free, so it's not about that. A little truthfulness and a little extra thought for good, loyal customers might be nice though. Guess we'll be giving our business to Buddyz, now that it's open."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent... The service is not. We were greeted right away, but drinks took literally 12 minutes before they arrived and we were the only table in the whole restaurant. When I did make eye contact with a waitress, she must have felt bad and realized she'd forgotten us, and said she had to go in the back to get some drinks. Then they came out right away.
The pizza took as long as we expected it to, probably about 25 minutes, but once it did arrive she never checked to make sure we had everything we needed or that it was okay. At the end of the meal, I had to ask a different waitress for a box and our check.

Service aside, the food is excellent. The pizza is fresh, crispy crust was delicious, and next time we will know just to get a pizza to go rather than sit in the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have read the reviews prior...

Told me my pie would be to me within THE hour...I clarified within AN hour right?  Correct.  An hour seems a bit long for a place 2 miles away.  1:15 later, called in and aoh yes, the driver is just leaving now.  nice.  $5 off the next pie ok?  NO.  ok $10 off the next.  Fine.  Arrived 1:38 minutes after ordering.  No high hopes here.  

Pizza was luke warm at best.  Lovely.  and the wrong type!  We ordered DEEP DISH, got PAN.  Now if you read the menu, which I did, they have deep dish and pan.  Now I understand that.  called back and got a manager that tried to explain that deep dish means pan to them on their system!!  R U kidding me????  I am not interested in solving your corporate stupidity, I want the pizza I ordered and I ordered it exactly how it is listed on your site!

Now the only thing that kep them from a 1 star rating is the manager offered to send another pizza for free, which I turned into next time and I did not have the time to wait for another timely delivery.  So KUDOS to the manager for doing the right thing, however everything else left a lot to be desired.  I know I will go back for 1 more pizza at least..."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and when I start eating it I found a human hair. Was so disgusting, never coming back"}
{"text":"I order a pizza and inside of it I found human hair. It was disgusting. The management is so bad. Bad customer service. I wanted to let everyone knows how dirty this place is ,never coming back"}
{"text":"Warning! If you have purchased any sort of certificate like \"local flavor\" or \"Groupon\" they no longer except them. I brought my family and then we ordered a pizza sides and drinks and when we receive the check we were told that they do not except any more certificates. About the food: The pizza is filling but left me a little underwhelmed. I ordered pepperoni sausage deep dish and it just wasn't as good as a lot of the other Chicago pizzas in town. Prices are decent but I would rather spend a couple dollars more somewhere else. Decor is very Chicago cool and the server was nice but not completely on the ball. If you're close by it might be worth dropping-in but I would not suggest driving 30 minutes out of your way like I did."}
{"text":"I enjoy their Chicago deep dish pizza. One of the few places you can get green olives on your pizza. TVs are great to watch a game. Beer is cold. All the ingredients for a good time."}
{"text":"Very best pizza in town and likely most inexpensive in town during happy hour. Antipasto also a good healthyish choice. Beer is a good deal as well."}
{"text":"Don't expand your chain if there is no quality control in place to ensure an equal experience at all of your outlets. I grew up on Rosati's and our experience here was a complete disaster.  Send the kids making the pies back to Rosati's pizza making school.  

This was a complete train wreck on multiple levels.  Ordered online.  When I saw that delivery was to be 70 -80 minutes I panicked.  We had been on the road for more than 8 hours, we were tired and hungry.  So I called the local restaurant to see if that estimate was accurate.   First dial, immediately put on hold.  After 5 minutes hung up and dialed again.  On hold for 7 minutes and just left it on speaker.  Finally a human.  Assured me that the pizza would be there within the hour but already wasted almost 15 minutes just trying to call and cancel.

So we waited and waited and what did we get?  The antithesis of a Rosati's pie - barely lukewarm (if you are going to offer a delivery service, make the effort to ensure that your product arrives at its optimal level).  The pizza was soooo skimpy on the sausage you had to steal from other pieces just to have enough topping. (True Chicago pies never suffer from a lack of pork chunks), The thin crust was neither flaky or crisp.  It was just dull and tasteless with an overload of tomato sauce, that wasn't even fresh. Building a flavorful pizza is not just about the quality of the individual ingredients but also about finding the right balance to create a final product.  Rosati's here must be trying to capitalize on being in a college town, thinking that the student body can't taste a bad pie when they eat one.  I'm pretty sure you can't fool them.  Didn't fool us."}
{"text":"We love Chicago pizza, and this was one of the best in Gilbert; we were ordering at least once a week.  However, about a year ago things started slipping there, and we hadn't ordered in a while.  Well, we just placed an order tonight, and after 2 hours our limp lifeless pizza was finally delivered.  That was the final nail in the coffin for Rosati's.

We have found a new Chicago pizza place, Salerno's (Guadelupe/Recker) that has some of the best pizza and beefs in town.  No delivery unfortunately."}
{"text":"My family and I came here to eat dinner and everything was good. My wife's food came out first, then mine came out about 15 minuets after but I ordered a full slab of ribs so I guess that's ok but what really made me mad was me son ordered a 10 inch pizza and that did not come out till a additional 15 minuets after my ribs. So my son had to wait over a hour to get his 10 inch pizza. And I had asked several times where his pizza was and I was told that it's coming out soon. I we will never be back to this location. It's also cramped and tiny inside. And it's not a place for a younger crowd it was full of old people. If your over 60 then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza.  They are odd with their systems.  Yes, explanation coming.  I ordered using a groupon and did it through the website as I thought it would be easiest.  Of course after ordering using the Groupon, the instructions said to call the order in.  Go figure.  I arrived and at first they were not going to take the Groupon because I did not call the order in.  I was told it was something to do with their systems.  Pretty funny and ridiculous, I was about to tell them if that was needed, to cancel the web order, and I could stand there and call in same on the phone so it wouldn't be an issue with the Groupon.  Some of these businesses are so funny how they sound when they say this drivel.  I stood my ground and said that if they would not honor the groupon to cancel the order.  DOH.  They worked their magic, made me pay the sales tax and I was on my way.  I got home and the pizza was true Chicago style, real tomatoes none of that pressed stuff, and the ingredients were fresh, the peppers had that tiny bit of crunch you crave along with the homemade sausge.  I think i got the fantastic four or something...sausge, peppers, onions, whatever.  It was very good.  For takeout, dominoes step to the side, that is if I'm not too lazy to get in the car to pick it up."}
{"text":"This family own restaurant shares the love for their customers. We built our own deep dish pizza tonight- pepperoni, Italian sausage, black olives, mushrooms, and tomatoes. It was tasty! Downside is price; however, we've got leftovers for the next few days! Thanks all!"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service itself is horrible they need all new waitresses. 
You have to get up and get your own drinks like why
The place isn't that big."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings! I am definitely going to order from Rosati's again."}
{"text":"Don't order using the Slices App. Literally, every single time they've messed up my order. I feel like they are more used to orders coming in over the phone and have less errors that way. Estimated time is hardly accurately and they've forgotten the seasoning on top a couple times."}
{"text":"I brought my 4 year old daughter here tonight to celebrate my birthday since I love their pizza, but I had never brought her here before.  We were greeted immediately upon walking through the door before we sat ourselves.  Our waitress, Holly, was super nice and went out of her way to make conversation with my daughter about her shirt, what she was drawing, and her good behavior.  She even brought a pizza dough ball to the table for us to play with while we waited on our food.

I had a small Caesar salad which came first.  Big shavings of cheese on top, good dressing.  Then the pizza came and it was just like I remembered: delicious.  We had thin crust w/ pepperoni and we could have polished off the whole pie if I didn't already plan on having dessert.  I'm already excited to eat the leftovers in the morning.

Outstanding service, great food, we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Got a medium 14 inch thin crust with extra sauce, salami, and meatball. Absolutely fantastic. The pizza was picture perfect. The chicken tenders are my favorite appetizer. Extra crispy and the Buffalo sauce is very zesty. The barbecue sauce is REALLY thick with a good smoky flavor and the ranch dressing is awesome. My favorite sandwich is the cheesy beef. The sandwich is loaded with beef, melted Mozzarella, and goes well with sweet or hot peppers on top."}
{"text":"Their pizza is always good! Love the deep dish! So when I ordered delivery and the wrong one was delivered I was a little disappointed... But when I called back they resolved it quickly and sent out another pie, and made it the next size up! Even though most people would be upset I know we all make a mistake.. It's how they took care of it that is gonna make me order delivery time and time again..."}
{"text":"Called to order a basic pizza for delivery. Was put on hold twice while I tried placing my order. Once my order was placed they said it would be delivered in about an hour. Almost two hours later the pizza still had not been delivered. I decided to finally call back. While trying to voice my concern on why I had not gotten my pizza yet I was but on hold three separate times. They finally realizing that their employee messed up and marked it down for pick up. Not a single person apologizing for them messing up. Will not be ordering from here ever again."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza & pasta dishes. Generous portions. We did have one small issue however, Josh the manager on duty went above & beyond to correct the mistake. We highly recommend them & their delivery service."}
{"text":"There are few places I would refer in Vegas, and this is one of them. Their pizza is addictive and scrumptious!  Always order one size bigger than you think because you'll want more. Ask for special deals to soften the expense here but everyone knows: when it comes to pizza you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic lunch at Rosati's. Our first time, and we were impressed. Leean was our waitress and she was fantastic. Super engaging & attentive but also left us alone to enjoy our meal. We ordered a margarita pizza just to see how they ranked amongst our favorite pizza joints and we were not disappointed by any stretch of the imagination. Lots of basil and a truly authentic flavor. We joined the rewards club and got a healthy discount. Made up for that on the tip . Leean was worth it!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Great service, great food. Lunch specials include a drink and super convenient pricing. Check it out! And try their sweet chili wings, my favorite"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The cheese is so delicious. Came for dinner on a Friday night and was greeted and seated right away. The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We got two calzones and a build your own pizza and everything was delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in all of Las Vegas! It's obvious that everything is prepared fresh daily with care. 

Even the pizza that was delivered outside of their normal range shows up piping hot and delicious. 

I highly recommend the bread sticks and the deep dish. 

You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't pick this place for the middle-o-road decent cheap pizza.  Was craving lasagna and gave Rosati's a shot.

OM Gobz super yum.  Takes them up another star just for that alone!  The bread stick and box of iceberg with one slice of cuke were kinda lame sauce.  But enough lasagna for 2 meals at my appetite level.

Their delivery has been always quick and reliable."}
{"text":"I had a couple of slices of pizza and a side salad. The pizza was amazing and the salad was pretty respectable for a pizza place. We work right by this place and the guys working the counter keep me coming in there. Extremely nice and always asks if everything worked out okay."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for delivery. Top choice over pizza hut, dominos or any other pick up or delivery place. Prices are good too. They said it would be an hour but it got there in 30 min, no complaints with that."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.......huge X large.  
Delivered quickly.  I am so happy to have Rosatis back in the 85259"}
{"text":"As a transplanted Chicagoan, I'm always on the lookout for great pizza. Sadly, there are far too places to get a good pie here. Even those chains from Chicago seem to have lost what it is to be a Chicago pizza. This Rosati's - not just any Rosati's, this one specifically - has one of the best Chicago pizzas. 

For the past 18 years, we have either eaten here or gotten take-out about 80 times (if not more), so we are very familiar with this place. They do have occasional issues with consistency, so we've found that our pizzas range from a \"7\" to a \"10\" depending on who is making them, but even their \"bad\" pizzas are still really good."}
{"text":"I am not even sure what to say: I had pasta that was overcooked including all
of the vegetables inside. My brother had a  Italian sandwich that made Subway seem gourmet.  The free garlic 'bread' was cooked in stale oil & the French bread- I was charged almost 3 dollars for - even though it's bread that normal restaurant give for free.

It was so bad that the three quarters of the meal I did not eat my $11 pasta- I left there- rather than even considering to eat it later. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Long black hair baked carefully in the center of the pie!!  Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my friends to buy 12 wings. We waited 40 minutes for the easiest order. Chefs were on their phone the whole time. I felt bad for the cashier, but it was a bit ridiculous. I don't know if it was just us, but it was very annoying."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza!  We have ordered for years in the East Valley, and agree that this is the best pizza around.  The staff is friendly and has a customer first attitude.  The delivery is fast and the pizza is hot enough that you wait to start eating.  Love the jalapeno, pepperoni and mushroom thin crust. This is the only pizza we will order now."}
{"text":"I needed a quick place to stop with the kids for lunch and was glad I chose to try this place. Service was excellent, food was very good and the price was very reasonable. It is a bit hidden from the main road so I did not realize it existed until a year after it opened but now plan to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"We order delivery for work on Saturdays at this location. Food has never been wrong. Delivery has never been late. Salads are huge but the thin crust pizza is my favorite. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is OK. Pizza is pretty darn good, but this place is too darn expensive. Not worth it in my opinion. If you have hundred dollar bills in each pocket, then this is your spot!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service both management (myra) and staff. Ordered a pizza online qaswe were headed into phoenix and were 30 min away. Arrived to rosatis and were told our order just came through via fax and it would be another 30 minute wait. They were rude and unapologetic.  Waited almost an hour after ordering inline.i complained to the manager and again she was rude and just said it wasnt us."}
{"text":"98 minutes after i called, and finished eating something else - figuring, my food is not coming, my soggy Rosati's pizza arrives. 
Extremely sub-par. Always has been.
Doesn't help that 2 years ago i swore i would never go back after i had a valid coupon and they just decided that day, ehhh were not honoring that.
Also came in for a slice and a soda at 1:14 pm once and noone was around. After i said hello? Someone in the back shouted! YYEeSSss???? 
Then proceeded to say
Sternly \"no slices now\" while drying his hands over a pizza he just removed from the oven.
I actually saw an instagram picture from someone who stayed at the four seasons of a cockroach in there bar area. Thats just crazy. You own a restaurant in troon north. Get your sh** together."}
{"text":"We normally order from another pizza place but decided to try this place. The Chicago Deep Dish wasn't why we had hoped for. The Greek Salad was a disappointment as well. I hate giving bad reviews but it just wasn't good. Expensive should mean better, I could have saved $15 and gotten better pizza and more food from one of their chain competitors."}
{"text":"I decided to try Rosati's because other than Dominos, Papa John's, etc., they were the only pizza place that would deliver to my hotel.

The pros:
-The customer service was great. I called to place my order and the price came out more expensive than what their website had listed. The girl who answered the phone gave me 10% off and it made the pizza even cheaper than what was listed on the website!
-The size:  This pizza was HUGE. I got a large (16\") with the double crust and this put a Dominos large to shame. 
-Speaking of the crust, the double crust was delicious. Great texture, not too thick but still thicker than a standard pizza crust and had a subtle taste that wasn't overwhelmingly salty or over seasoned. It reminded me of a baked bread loaf you'd get at a nice restaurant. 
-The delivery driver was polite and punctual. Not only that, when the pizza was delivered it was still too hot to eat!

The cons:
-The only way to order from their website is to create an account. Not a huge deal since I was able to call in but much less convenient. 
-I ordered a pizza with Mozzarella, Sausage, Pepperoni, Tomato, Onion, and Fresh Garlic. Unfortunately, the pizza I got was missing pepperoni.

Short of getting my order slightly wrong, this place is definitely worth checking out for yourself. I generally try to avoid the chain pizza joints and look for those hidden gems in the different cities I travel to. I think I found one in Rosati's."}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is great, thin crust and in squares. The Hawaiian luau is my favorite, it has BBQ sauce on it and I add jalape√±os. The salad is just standard but the breadsticks are amazing. They deliver always on time."}
{"text":"I'm not a Las Vegas local, and on my trip there last night, a well-meaning acquaintance sent me out to Summerlin to find an old bookshop manned by geezers.  I couldn't find the place (erroneous address, incomplete directions), and I ended up somewhat lost, a little cold, and very, very hungry.  So I fired up the heater in the rental car, Yelped nearby businesses with my smartphone, and ended up deciding to hit Rosati's pizza.  After all, the rating was a solid 4 stars.

 Rosati's is located on what seems to be a major road through Summerlin, and its clientele are pleasingly non-threatening family types of a few different colors who have the air of regulars.  The girl behind the counter was friendly, nice, & helpful.  The restaurant is clean, and even the cooks had pretty immaculate aprons.  I wasn't scared that I was risking any sort of injury or illness or cockroach sightings by being there (which is more than I can say for my sojourn @ the Excalibur Hotel on the Strip, but I digress).  Further, it seems to have won a reader's poll for Best Pizza in Las Vegas Weekly.  So, I ordered pizza, right?  Nope.  I ordered a calzone, which is basically a pizza folded in half with toppings as stuffings.   

 And when I write \"a pizza folded in half with toppings as stuffings,\" that's exactly what I mean.  After ordering a Spinach Calzone and only finishing a little less than half of it, I the counter girl told me that at Rosati's their calzones are made with a MEDIUM-SIZED PIZZA DOUGH and stuffed accordingly.  I write this not to criticize, but to warn you that you're not going to be getting what I expected, which was a sanely-portioned calzone that would satisfy one person who wasn't entering an eating competition.  It arrived huger than my plate, with pizza sauce on the side as a garnish, and was probably stuffed with at least three pounds of cheese.  I am not joking.  I really do think it was three pounds of cheese.

 As far as taste, I'd have to rate the calzone as way too salty to be truly enjoyable.  My favorite part of it was the closure part of the dough, which was the only part that didn't go from salty crust into salty cheese and (how the heck did this happen?) salty spinach.  I'm a huge fan of doughy things, which most calzones supply very well, but this one only featured in the cute, braided-looking closure.  

 But did that stop me from eating half of the monstrously-sized calzone?  No, it did not.  Yes, I ate a pound and a half of cheese, some dough, and some saline spinach.  And I enjoyed the cheese and the dough--the spinach threw me with its brackishness.  The aggressively salted dough plus the (salty) cheese needed a some sort of plain foil to neutralize their pungency.  The pizza sauce didn't help matters.  Though a little sweet, of course it was also salty too, and, rather unfortunately reminded me of something from a jar from before grocery stores offered pasta & pizza sauces that were actually something  you'd want on your pizza or pasta.

 If I'm making this sound awful, it really wasn't.  I wouldn't have eaten so much, plus taken the rest home and eaten a large part of the remnants for breakfast.  Plus, somehow I remain convinced that, if I'd gotten this combo on a pizza, and not in a calzone, it would have tasted better.  For one thing, much less surface of the dough looking like it needs seasoning, since most of a pizza crust is covered in sauce and toppings.  I almost wonder if the cooks thought \"Well, it looks so bare.  What do we have?  Salt!  That tastes good with everything!\"

 [And I came home today and got what I thought would be a taco but turned out to be a glorified quesadilla from a local Mexican place that I'll also be giving a definite 2 stars.  Oy.  I don't know if I ever want to eat cheese again!]

 I wish I could give this place 3 stars for the friendly service and nice ambiance, but the saline spinach knocked it down at least a half point.  And there're no 2 1/2-star ratings on Yelp.  But, if I'm ever lost & hungry in Summerlin again, I might go there, and try the pizza, just to see if I'm right about my hunch, and if I agree with the palates of the readers of Las Vegas Weekly."}
{"text":"I called Maciano`s pizza. I was put on hold. They took my order. Pizza came, paid the guy and when i looked on the box Rosati`s name was on it. Rosati`s highjacked Maciano`s phone number. Same thing happen to my son-in-law. $34+ dollar pizza. Waste of money. Sauce on a cracker with cheese.I feel like a fool. Stay away from Rosati`s. What can you do. Really made for a bad pizza experience. My wife wanted Maciano`s. I felt bad. Maciano`s is closed."}
{"text":"IF YOU CAN STAY AWAY STAY ! Don't come here! They sucks especially the owner. He's super rude his name is Ty. I had my order mess up twice and I wanted a refund . I am super upset! He didn't even want to talk to me. I never write negative reviews , but this one deserves one. They just were just horrible !"}
{"text":"I should have checked out the reviews before ordering! Little Ceasers pizza tastes a ton better and not to mention the breadsticks had NO FLAVOR!! The pizza had very little sauce and was INCREDIBLY DRY! Don't waste your money, order elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I order here every once in awhile but I am officially done with this location. The first time I ordered here the pizza was ok, second time got food poisoned, third and forth once again ok, last Tuesday was my last. When I entered the lady told me that they had to finish my order so I was fine with the fact my food would be fresh. As I was waiting, I was looking at the guy taking pizzas out of the oven and was so excited that I was going to get a fresh pizza. I was wrong!!! my pizza was the one sitting under the light for who knows how long and my wings was what I was waiting for. When I got home my pizza was cold and the wings tasted weird. I am surprised my kids and I did not get food poisoned. I was going to call management and tell them about my bad experience but I decided all together not to return. I will continue to take the drive to Centennial Hills location where I first discovered this restaurant at least my food was always fresh and I never got food poisoned."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on these days, but the last 4 pizzas that were delivered over the last 2 months were terrible. Looks like they have been sitting for a while. Great pizza when things are done right."}
{"text":"This place blows.  If only I can give 0 star on yelp.. I would give it to this place.  I ordered pizza for our potluck at work and picked it up during my lunch break.  Guess what? The cook forgot the pizza and it burnt so they need another 10 minutes to make it? Who does that? What a complete waste of time.  To top it off.. they gave me a $5 coupon for inconvinience? What makes you think I'm coming back after this stunt.. THIS PLACE RUINED MY DAY. i hate it."}
{"text":"I found that Rosati's Pizza is absolutely the best.... The wings are definitely the best I have had....The waitresses are eager to help you with any thing you may need. Very attentive Management.  Every time my Parent's and I come Management is always around on the main floor...we come here once a week and never had a problem. I can't wait till next week...."}
{"text":"Used to be a great spot, not since new management. I've been a 5 year customer of this place. New management comes in and screws everything up and doubles prices. Can confidently say I'll never return to this location after 5 years. Pizza sucks now and sauce is different."}
{"text":"Delivery guy was super friendly and chill! Delivered super fast (actually a half hour before estimated time) and food was piping hot and the soda cold. Everything was delicious always love Rosatie's pizza and this location certainly lives up to the legendary pizza name. You won't be disappointed ordering from here."}
{"text":"This place recently re-opened after being closed for a little while. My family and I decided to order some pizza's for dinner. Just awful!  Worst mistake ever. BIG BIG disappointment. Little Cesar's $5 pepperoni is better than this garbage. I used to like Rosati's but this order ruined it for me. I'll never order pizza from this place ever again."}
{"text":"I love Rosati's! Their food is always delicious and I've never been let down. From their pastas to their pizzas... hands down DELICIOUS. The ziti is my absolute favorite. Tastes like Italian heaven. It is hard being Italian and finding a place that tastes the right way."}
{"text":"The last three times the toppings on the pizza fall far short of the edge. In fact, all of the outer pieces had no toppings. Quite a waste of money, considering how pricey. I called to inquire about this, no answer, just \"sorry\". It's too bad, because this is my favorite pizza, when prepared properly. I'm done."}
{"text":"Order lunch last week from them and it arrived on time. The food was barely warm for them being just around the corner. I was hoping for better food since they are so close and have had good experience at other Rosati's. I might try them again but not sure..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wings, great calzones, pretty much anything on the menu is great. I for some reason always have an issue when I call in an order, either I'm talking funny (which I don't believe I do) or the person on the other line is hard of hearing. But the order always comes out perfect. Love the Chicago style pizza, and the wings are 100 times better than the overpriced ones at Buffalo Wild Wings. Been ordering from this location for 6 years now and food always comes top notch! Just sometimes when I call in my  order it leaves me frustrated. Hahaha"}
{"text":"I was starving and stopped by this shopping center looking for Slim's Sub Shop.  I was disappointed to see that Slim's closed.  I was on a time crunch and saw Rosati's.

I ordered 2 slices of Cheese Pizza, and wanted a bottle of Water....the girl working the register told me they were out of bottled Water, Strike 1.  

The pizza came out after a few minutes.  The slices were huge!  It was almost the size of a small Pizza!  I thought that the Pizza was awful, the sauce tasted like canned sauce, the Cheese was flavorless, and I thought the crust was undercooked and rubbery, Strikes 2, 3, 4.  Since I was starving I ate it anyway, except I didn't eat the crust....which is rare for me, I always eat the crust....it was that bad.

I know this place is a chain so I'm not sure I will ever try it again....not my type of place.  I prefer better quality pizza.

Will I return?  No way!"}

We enjoyed both the Double Dough and Thin Crust Pizzas.  They each have slightly different flavors and textures.  

I didn't care for the Chicken Wings.  They douse it in Buffalo Sauce here....it's not \"baked\" into the Wing, so it's more like a dipping Sauce.  I prefer it the other way.

The Fries, Breaded Mushrooms, and Mozzarella Sticks are so/so.

The Garlic Cheese Bread is awesome.  I could easily order 2 of those and a bottle of Wine and I'd be good to go.

The service here is hit & miss.  It's a young group of servers and they haven't quite learned real customer service yet.  However, not much you can expect from a chain pizza joint.

It's too far out of the way for us to come here on a regular basis.  If I'm paying full price, there are other Rosati locations closer to our home.  However, if there's another Groupon with 50% off, it will be worth the drive.

{"text":"Ordered Rosati's for the first time last night.... YUM!! Delivery was faster than expected. Cheese pizza was simple but very tasty. Also got little bite-sized desserts that came with Nutella... heaven!! Will definitely order again :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night and I was completely happy. The ribs were delicious, the server was super friendly, in fact all the staff was wonderful. The food took a little while to come but not an unusual time, and everything was made fresh. The deserts were wonderful (cannoli and cheesecake) and not too expensive. I will come back."}
{"text":"I went to a different Rosati's last night (Bell Rd.) and the service was amazing, the food was amazing, and everyone was really friendly. I came to this Rosati's tonight and I was completely appalled. They do not accept coupons from the Internet, they badmouthed the other store, the prices are higher, and they're less flexible with their menu. For example, I wanted a Caesar salad with my ribs, but I had to pay extra. They went on to tell me all the other stores are fake and they are the one and best. They were goofing off, rude, and not wearing gloves. Obviously this is mismanagement. Ugh. I won't waste my money here."}
{"text":"Does anyone have an update on what is happening here!!?? I call and call and no one answers. I ordered a pizza a couple weeks ago that obviously wasn't the same recipe they had previously used ... in the mean time I've switched to the Rosati's on Val Vista (I've been informed it's the same owner)."}
{"text":"This place is terrible- unless you like pizza that tastes like the stuff out of the freezer  from the grocery.  We ordered it tonight and it was awful.  The crust was terrible, the pepperoni and sausage was extremely sparse- most pieces had only 1 tiny piece of sausage and possibly a piece of pepperoni,  the cheese was so thin you could see through to sauce.  It was also cold.  We ordered it at 7:12 (per ticket) and my husband walked in door at 8pm.  I guess since there was hardly anything on it, it cooked quickly!  Maybe none of this would be a big deal if it were inexpensive however, it is very pricey ($21.96 for 18 inch with two toppings)  - being from Chicago I want a pizza that tastes like home- this is not at Rosati's (at least location on Olive in Peoria).  I would love for the corporate office to see what crap they are churning out!"}
{"text":"Rosati's pizza is always awesome, no denying that!  This location however, is absolutely disgusting.  I have no idea how the health department has not paid this establishment a visit.  The walls are covered in filth, carpet and entrance area looks like it has never been mopped or vacuumed.  I don't even want to know what it looks like in the kitchen.  We usually order delivery from this place, but today picked up.  I don't know if we will be returning here!"}
{"text":"These guys have great thin crust pizza! It's a go to pizza for me. They're usually pretty busy so I would recommend getting your order in early."}
{"text":"A good place for pizza.  The pies aren't too greasy and the lunch special I a great deal in this area of scottsdale...normally devoid of value-conscience lunch shoppers.  The sausage pizza is particularly good, with a nice balance of sausage and cheese."}
{"text":"Great pizza the extra large is super big perfect amount of cheese to meat and vegi ratio the crust was thin and crispy order was hot and ready to go when we picked it up 20 min ride home still could barely touch it."}
{"text":"Ordered the large 20 inch pizza ample toppings very tasty and hot if you keep to the specials they are reasonably priced if you order alacart it will get pricy used the online order system works great pizza done on time this location has only pickup and delivery."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and get take out from Rosati's weekly and consider it a treat! The thin crust pizza is always crisp and the sauce is fantastic!  We also love the hot Italian Beef and Meatball Subs. We don't expect anything more than a great pizza place. Service may be slow but it's worth the wait!  All good things take time. If I want fast food, I'll hit a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"must have msg in it 

i had pains in my left arm for days and have no heart conditions or bp issues 

i been checked wtf is in it never again"}
{"text":"They get a two only cause their pizza and wings are awesome.  Their prices are bad for some things-good on others.  I paid $5 for an order of calamari.  8 circular pieces, but no pieces with legs or anything.  They were hard on outside but pure rubber on the inside.  I get calamari literally anywhere I can... I love it normally- but would not waste money buying it here.  Neither my order of breads ticks or calamari came with marinara.  NO  SAUCE.  Only got Ranch for my wings.  I ordered at 4:40pm and they said they'd be here in less than an hour.  An hour and a half later- I was dialing the pizza place to see where my food was at as they pulled up.  I tipped $10 cause I'm on their delivery border but had I not been far- I would've docked tip.  FYI I tip extra for early.  My last delivery from hungry Howie was twenty min early- he got a $15 tip from me.  We just wanted something different so we ordered rosati's.         I have picked up from this location as well before and ended up waiting 20-30 min passed the time they gave me in the restaurant... Watching others eat.  The have me a free extra order of 6 wings for my wait... But that seems to be the main issue they have consistently.. Timing.  So- skip the calamari - make sure u get your sauces and expect a wait.  Pizza and wings are complaint free"}
{"text":"They seem to get poor reviews at all their locations, which must be a management issue. I have no complaints though. I have been to a couple of their locations and staff has always been great, and I love their pizza. It is one of my go-to places. Their antipasto salad is awesome too. :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza. Slooooow! Never in my life have I seen a slower pizza place. Unfortunately I bought several Groupon's and I'm considering not even using the rest. We have come in here when there are literally 2 people in the whole place, and the quickest we ever got our pizza was 1 1/2 hours. Really? Pizzas don't cook that long, and we order the thin crust, not deep dish. I think they take care of the carry-outs first but really, an hour and a half? We even waited over two hours one time. Even with a Groupon this pizza is way over priced. And it isn't even that good. The only reason that I got the Groupons is that we purchased a carry-out pizza years ago and recalled it being decent. This place is history for us."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza how I love my pizza so much!!!

After hearing so many good things about Rosatis I had to order. First thing looking at the menu I really liked the variety of pizzas, appetizers and toppings you are able to order. +

After ordering I found the operator imputed my address in wrong and it took a little over an hour an twenty to get the pizza. I understand it was an honest mistake but didn't feel good.

Down to the pizza! The pizza I went with was the deep dish pep and sausage. Great choice!!! This was a legit deep dish pizza. A great blend between the meat and the sauce. The crust was thick like I like it! The pizza was cooked to perfection and wasn't affected by the delay with my order. Have to say I will DEFINITELY BE ORDERING AGIAN! 

Hope the feedback was helpful.... Enjoy fellow yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars. Here's why - the pizza was a solid 4. The customer service was a big ZERO! (One employee in particular.)

First, I called ahead to order my pizza. BUT I was put on hold for over 3 minutes so I hung up and drove there instead. Then... nightmare when I reach the counter.

Me: Hi can I order a 16 inch...

Employee: No. We don't sell pizza here.

Me: *puzzled, and very annoyed* Um... Can I order a 16 inch classic combo...

Employee: What? 18 inch? What toppings?

Me: *extremely annoyed* I SAID 16 INCH CLASSIC COMBO!

So I ordered. And I paid. And sat there, waiting.  Meanwhile, there are only 3 tables of guests. Not busy at all...

There's a man sitting at the bar, waiting for his food. His order was incorrectly wrapped up to go. He very politely said it was ok, as a different (nice) employee helped make his order right.

There's also a woman waiting for a pizza. I think her order was wrong, or was taking too long, or something definitely not right was going on. She was annoyed. Employees were apologizing.

Then the rude and unhelpful employee belittles the nice employee. This was loud enough for customers to hear.  Is this really happening?  Yes, yes it is.

The rude employee goes over to a table who wants to take their pizza to go. She says, \"no, we don't box pizza to go. You need to eat this all.\"  ((I CAN'T HANDLE THIS! IS THIS REAL? WHY IS SHE LIKE THIS?))

Nice employee notices that I've been waiting forever for my pizza and asks for my name, so she can keep an eye out on it. I appreciated this kind gesture.  YES... PLEASE... GET ME OUT OF HERE!

My pizza is finally ready. I open the box to inspect it. Looks great, smells great. I GTFO and go home to devour my delicious pizza. Thanks to the kitchen staff for making a tasty pizza! But I will definitely never go back to this place again. Horrendous service by one particular employee. I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I must say, the pizza is very tasty. However, the proper website for this location doesn't work. Check your card activity after delivery. I had my tip amount charged twice and had to dispute the charge."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on multiple occasions. The bartender/server is usually Renee when we stop in. She's alway attentive and quick to make sure we have everything we want and are satisfied with our meal and drinks. We cherish quality service and quality people. And that's what we get at rosatis."}
{"text":"For some reason my co-workers continue to want to order food from this restaurant every Friday when the boss is buying. All free lunches have their tradeoffs, and for me, this one is no longer worth it. On a couple of occasions I have tried the individual pizzas, which taste a lot like the cardboard they come in. One of my office mates raves about the meat ravioli; tried that once and as another reviewer indicated, it tasted like it came out of a can. 

I am going out to lunch today and buying my own food (better to escape the smell of raw onions one of these \"ladies\" likes to cram onto her meatball sub). 

In the several times I have tried to order off this menu it seems like something listed doesn't actually exist in their restaurant. No, we don't have sun dried tomatoes; no, we don't have balsamic dressing... 

Today I thought I would just get a salad, but I didn't want the heavy garlicky dressing that they usually thrust upon you and asked for olive oil instead. I was advised they don't have olive oil. I understand maybe in this neighborhood the sun dried tomatoes aren't a popular item, that they might be out of balsamic (actually I don't really because, although they have been listed on the print and online menu for the last 8 months, they never have had those effing tomatoes). However, how can any Italian restaurant not have olive oil?

The descriptions for a couple of their dressings mention that they are made in house. Perhaps these people use canola oil in their dressings rather than olive oil, which sounds kind of Italian. It's actually Canadian - in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service.

Went in on a Saturday night with 5 other people. Decided to get their famous \"Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza\" but was cautioned it would take 35 minutes to cook so we went with a different pizza option. Ordered buffalo wings as an appetizer, two 14\" pizzas and two salads. 

After our initial food and drink order it took 25 minutes for us to flag down our server. Note: he didn't come by to check on us since our initial food/drink order, WE flagged him down. We were highly irritated by this point. We even witnessed a server accidentally spill a kids drink from his table and even joked that it's going to take another 10 minutes for him to get a refill. I would say it took about 8 minutes for that same server to come back to refill his soda.

Our food came out, including our buffalo wings which was intended to be an appetizer NOT part of our main course. Let's also add that we could've gotten the Chicago Style Deep Dish and it wouldn't have made a difference on the waiting period!!!! Great pizza, which is why this place gets one star (even if there was an option for zero stars).

Well, the following day we were having a get together and decided to order from this place. The food was good and we were going to call and pick it up. Sure, we had bad customer service the day before but...can you really have bad customer service during a pick up order? Why, yes. Yes you can.

Called in an order of two 18\" pizzas and two Caesar salads for pick up. Went inside the \"Pickup and Takeout\" area and waited for at least 5 minutes with no employee to be found, got fed up and left the cash on the till (enough to pay for the entire order and then some), went to the warmer and double checked the reciept on the pizzas to verify it was mine, took it (an employee saw me by this point and didn't stop me to verify I wasn't stealing) and went back to my car. Then remembered I ordered two salads and went back in. Waited another couple minutes and finally saw someone in the kitchen and asked if anyone was working here. Finally had an employee come by to cash me out and give me my salads. Worst customer experience of my life and I am pretty lenient when it comes to customer service at restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is good as always...but holy shit...I can't believe the managers think 2 people (one of them new) can handle a full restaurant, Walk ins asking for take out, and all the call in delivery orders, all while bussing tables when people leave ...after 30 mins, I walked out without my pizza and saw 4 other families walk out while I was there...I watched families get sat down at tables that hadn't been wiped and the girl bussing dirty tables reaching straight up to grab fresh pizzas to take to tables (still with food on her hands from bussing the last table)...even heard the girl call by phone to ask owners for help and sounded like the owners were pissed off?!?!!?....only reason I went in this time was cause last week I ordered pizza for delivery and had to call and cancel cause it hadn't arrived after 95 minutes"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this Rosati's multiple times.  They never disappoint!! We love the deep dish but hate the wait for it to cook.  Today we had a thin crust meat mania.  This pizza is amazing!! Meat is piled on and even through out.  Our pizza was fresh delicious.  The crust is perfectly crisp.
We had a coupon for free wings so we gave them a try.  They were alright at best but I will stick with the pizza next time. 
Ordering the pizza was easy.  I do wish ordering on line was an option but the staff is friendly, and efficient. 
This is our favorite pizza spot!! I really do need to start taking advantage of the happy hour specials though- $6 cheese pizza and $1 off beers!"}
{"text":"Rosatis at 1495 N Hayden Road IS HORRIBLE.  The pizza was the worst I have ever had in my life.  The dough was soggy and tastes like cardboard.  The pizza sauce was flat and had no flavor or sauciness.  It tasted like it had been watered down!   The cheese tasted like plastic.   The employees even were rude.  I have ordered from other Rosati's, one in Mesa and the other on Baseline.  This one location, however, is abhorrent!    I have eaten all kinds of pizza in my life, including authentic NY Pizza and Little Caesers, Pizza Hut, etc.  This Pizza, from this location, was GROSS!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering pizza from this location for almost 10 years and have to say that what I got this evening, deep dish spinach classic, was the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. 

The crust was so bad I couldn't even cut it with a knife without getting part of the box stuck to the crust. This pizza didn't even have the usual taste. I don't know if ingredients are being changed or the staff isn't following the recipes but this was bad. 

This was a 40.00 learning experience because never again will I order from here or recommend this location to others. 

Sorry but this was not Chicago Style pizza in any way, shape or form. 

I hope they improve but based on the other reviews I don't think they will last much longer."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the restaurant for a \"Dine-In\" experience on November 7, 2009.  We arrived at 6:15.  It took over 45 minutes for my family to receive their order.  There were only 3 other customers in the restaurant so a busy restaurant was not the problem.  It took over 20 minutes for the waiter to notify me that one of the items on the menu was not available.  My barbeque ribs were overcooked and it was not a full rack unless the pig was named \"Wilbur\" and was from Charlotte's Web.  It was more like 3/4 of a rack of ribs.  There was barely any sauce on the overdone ribs.  Food has a grade of C+ (and I'm being generous).

Kitchen Help - during our stay at the establishment I noticed one thing,  the kitchen help was of no help at all. Several times I noticed the kitchen help coming out the back service door to help themselves to the soda fountain.  It was not just one but two or three individuals that came out multiple times.  When I was leaving the restaurant, it all became clear to me. There were probably about 5 or 6 people in the kitchen, and maybe one or two were working.  Several girls were staring through the kitchen door observation window out to the parking lot where one of the employees was smoking a cigarette and checking out one of the cars parked in the dirt.  Most of the employee's cars were parked in such a haphazard way that it looked like a high school drive-in more than a respectable restaurant.  One employee is certainly active because he was also one of the ones that kept helping himself to the soda at the fountain.  It also doesn't help that the male kitchen help were not clean-shaven.  The kitchen help gets a grade of D- (I've seen worse and that's why it's not an F).

Service - I would have to say this was the only bright spot in the whole experience.  Our waiter, busted his butt to make sure our dining experience was good.  I know he was covering for the kitchen help because he was very apologetic and seemed frustrated at times with what was going on in the kitchen. I give him a grade of A.

My final thoughts:  I have done more than my share of restaurant work in my youth and I have been in the Customer Service field for over 20 years.  This experience was not a good one.  On the website I'm sure Sam Rosati would not stand for this kind of kitchen help or quality of food that I experienced on Saturday November 7, 2009.  Since the restaurant is not in the best of locations, it will have to survive by word of mouth.  It is not going to survive for very long with kitchen help and food like I experienced.

Russ

p.s.  I'm not sure about those earlier ratings of 4 stars because this particular Rosati's was not open during 2008."}
{"text":"Deep dish is crazy good, only reasons not 5 stars is I've never been to Chicago and 5 stars is perfecto"}
{"text":"Food was hot and delivered quickly. Staying in phoenix for my job didn't want to leave hotel, it filled my belly. Food was good."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyyyyyy!

Ordered delivery - 12\" classic combo (hubby's favorite pizza toppings) on pan crust with alfredo sauce instead of tomato. Was offered a free one-topping 12\" just for signing up with my email address! score...I got myself a 12\" pepperoni and made it a deep dish for just a few bucks extra. Was quoted an hour delivery time - pizzas arrived in 45-50 min.
Pizzas were hot and super heavy and once in our mouths - super yummy! We finally found a pizza spot that we LOVE!  Their alfredo sauce was nicely balanced and the ingredients are of high quality. Hopefully they could keep up this rep with us for future orders.

Yes - we are fans!"}
{"text":"Sadly I'm downgrading Rosati's. The more I have it the worse and worse it gets.  The crust is too much like cardboard for me.  And the ingredients are really, really cheap. 

Rosati's its me, not you...well, its kind of you."}
{"text":"So, I called to place an order, and Ysena on the phone was repeatedly interrupting me.  I had to ask to speak to her manager.  Then, I called again, and finally got my order in.

Then I drove all the way there to pick it up, only to learn the order wasn't logged in their system.  It appears they have front desk workers intentionally dropping order if you ask to speak to a manager. 

Will never order here again."}
{"text":"Once, my favorite pizza place around. Recently, it has been subpar. For the price I pay, it's not worth it. Looks like I'll need a new place as my go to pizza joint!"}
{"text":"If you're from Chicago you know good pizza and good beef sangwiches! This place has it along with a daily happy hour. So there!!!"}
{"text":"Recently received a menu in our mail and decided to give the deep dish a try. I called it in and hubby picked up to bring home. Awesome deep dish pizza very Chicago authentic and crust perfectly cooked. Best part is it held firmly together and even  a few days later enjoyed leftover pizza that still tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Kind of a two-strikes-and-you're-out type deal.

Ordered a pizza last night at 8:20pm. Was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. Since we live nearby, we leave at the 30 min mark. Last time, it took 10-15 min longer than expected, so we decided to give it a little extra time. 

We arrive at 8:55pm. The one person in the front tells us the pizza \"isn't ready yet, but will be ready soon.\" Now, to be fair, it's Friday night. It's almost 9pm. But there isn't a soul in the store and the phone is barely ringing. So we assume, okay, take a seat, she'll let us know. 3 or 4 other employees make it out to the front, answering the phones, etc. But no one even looks at us. The only two people in the store.

We sit for another 15 min, my eyes glued to the pizza warmer - no new pizzas have arrived, nothing new waiting for patient customers. We ordered a pizza, an order of cheese breadsticks, and a few cookies - and still 30 minutes later we haven't heard a thing. Did they forget about us? The girl on the phone DID seem busy - she'd been calling all the recent take out customers to tell them they are out of what they'd ordered - but come on,  30 min?

So finally I had to ask. Of course, they'd been sitting in the warmer SINCE WE'D ARRIVED, some 30 minutes ago. Clearly angry we'd been waiting for so long, and our tasty, fresh Rosati's pizza now reduced to stale, gooey mess, the girl can only muster a \"sorry\" and an \"enjoy your pizza\".

Which we didn't, because, OF COURSE, it. wasn't. even. the. right. pizza.

 Sure, it was \"close\", but when you order a pizza, and speak with an actual human being, you figure at least you'll get the right pizza. Sure, it might take an hour, but still...  And when you spend $35 on the wrong pizza you had to wait an hour for, dry breadsticks and uncooked cookies, well, I stew all night and get up to rate you on Yelp.

Never again.

EDIT: Owner called in regards to my review. Offered $10 off next order of 'za. Sometimes I stick to my guns, and well, sometimes I'm just crazy hungry.
He gets a pass today."}
{"text":"My review is solely on the deep dish. My first experience with deep dish pizza was from grimaldi's and honestly it wasn't that great. It wasn't until a friend of mine brought some deep dish pizzas from Rosati's that i learned to love it. The deep dish pizza here has the right amount of cheese and toppings and it will definitely make you full. It's really hard for me to go back to eating a regular pizza after trying this. Been going to rosati's ever since for the deep dish. Save a trip to strip and go try Rosati's."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money! Ordered two calzones, barely any toppings inside. I think we got a whole 4 pepperonis inside. One was about 2/3 the size of the other and mostly crust. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Most disgusting pizza I've ever tasted. Flavorless, thick solidified cheese, slimy crust, tasteless sauce.  Pizza was cold when it arrived because they took down the wrong address and tries to deliver it to someone else. Very disappointed.  Spent nearly $30 on a small sausage pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks. Pizza inedible. Wasted money. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"definitely mediocre.. 

This is the place I turn to around this area to replace my cravings for pizza, more specifically the Lou Malnati's deep dish.
I only order on Mondays for the 50% off pizzas which makes it pretty legit. 
If you're not looking for high end taste but just a generally good pizza experience, it's the place to go.

SO my story is that I go on Mondays, get a large pizza for 50% off, and just eat it for all my meals which last me til Wednesday. ~12-18$ for 3 days of meals isn't so bad. . . especially if I get sick of it by the last slice.

Promptness is average. sometimes it runs longer though. I'd give it an extra 10-15 min after the estimated time."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza last night around 11pm through Uber Eats. The pizza arrived prompt and still hot. While eating the pizza it was truly enjoyable, only thing I didn't like was the crust which is normally my favorite part. Now on to the reason for the two-stars. About 2 hours after eating I started to feel sick. The pizza didn't last long and came back up the way it went in. Food poisoning."}
{"text":"I have had good food from here in the past BUT this time the food was garbage.  Thin crust pizza was so greasy that the grease was dripping out of the bottom of the box.  The mushrooms were deflated w tiny mushrooms inside the big breaded casings.  Gordon Ramsey would of gone off.  And to top it all the foods overpriced for the quality.  I ended up throwing the rest in the trash.  I never through pizza in the trash.  

Like they say on the Shark Tank..

I'm Out"}
{"text":"Competent pizza & subs.  Not exactly in-depth but captures the excitement of this particular location rather accurately."}
{"text":"We love Chicago style pizza. This place is practically across the street from our house. This should be a match made in heaven. Sadly, no. The cost is way more than it should be. The staff are not happy. The order will be wrong more often than right. And to top it off, the taste isn't that great. I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"Not feeling like leaving the house, I searched Grub Hub to find that Rosati's would deliver to us, and had a good selection of pizza, sandwiches, pasta and other fare.

We ordered a chicken parm sandwich on garlic bread with sweet peppers and fries, and a meatball sandwich with sweet peppers and fries. We also asked for ranch in the comments section. With delivery fee and tip, our order was $30.

The delivery was FAST.  Expected between 1620 and 1630, our food came at around 1610.

Inside the bag, there was one cup of peppers, and to our chagrin, no ranch.  I enjoyed the meatball sandwich, but the fries seemed like they were bland and freezer-burned, no doubt of the frozen variety. My husband thought that his chicken parm was ok. I think mostly sad over his lack of ranch. It was also on the same roll I had, and not any special garlic bread we paid an extra buck for. I don't know what we expected, but it was the same as mine.

We may try something else from Rosati's in the future, but weren't specifically impressed by our food."}
{"text":"I have never ordered the pizza there but I did order pasta for delivery. My order was spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmigiana and fettucini Alfredo. Let me just say that it was not at all good. The pasta was over cooked. Meatballs were flavorless and overall tasting of food was below average standards. I will order pizza one day and then finalize my star rating!!"}
{"text":"I always order the Heavyweight (extra pepperoni, extra sausage, & extra cheese) & the dough nuts. The best pizza in town!!!"}
{"text":"Never cared for their pizza, I consider it more of a flat bread with cheese nuked on top of bread, it doesn't pull away from a pizza like it should.  Gave their wings a try, buffalo style.  They only had two to choose from which kind of sucked.  They said they would be crispy but they were very soggy.  They were a descent size and not horribly priced.  The sauce was straight forward hot sauce, nothing special.  If I was in dyer need of wings I'd hit them up, but nothing close to being anything special."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't terrible but it also wasn't great for $30. The toppings including the cheese, slid right off the crust. We ordered the pepperoni supreme with a double crust. The crust was not \"double\" by any means it was a normal crust although soggy in the middle and tasted sweet like a crescent roll. The toppings were good but cut very big. Overall The pizza had no taste. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I order delivery through eat24. Food is always hot,  not too much grease,  usually prompt delivery.  Inexpensive too."}
{"text":"Our first visit - ordered for pick up- probably won't do that again- when I got home-  the box was completely wet and soggy- we ordered the Deep dish Chicago pizza. The pizza was ok, 
 The ingredients looked and tasted fresh- with a little more spices to kick in- this would have seemed like we were in Chicago.
They were fast and friendly in the store,  I would still go eat here and try again, this time I would order for dine in to see if there is a difference."}
{"text":"I gave Rosati's five stars cause their product and service is phenomenal.  I am from Chicago, IL and Rosati's make me feel like I am at home when it comes down to some delicious pizza.  If you want some Chicago style pizza come check out Rosati's."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. Sometimes the sauce is a little sweet but other than that delicious pizza! I don't have much interaction with the staff so my review is purely food related. :)"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location. I ordered takeout and got a XL sausage pepperoni pizza. It matched any other pizzas I've gotten from other Rosati's. I will mention I was hesitant to order due to seeing past reviews for this location and it took me 7 months to finally give it a try. I am not disappointed. Also i had coupon for late night meal deal."}
{"text":"I called in and ordered one large thin crust pizza with half hamburger and one large double crust pizza with half hamburger for delivery. I also ordered a family size chicken parmigiana with mostaccioli.  When the order arrived my son received the order and there was one one thin crust pizza and a large tray of mostaccioli no chicken.  I called the store as the driver was pulling away and explained that the order was wrong.  I was told they would call him and see if he dropped off the wrong order and would call me back in 5 minutes. After waiting ten minutes and no call back I called the store and they had no idea of the error with my order.  I asked for the manager and I believe someone named JT got on the phone and said he was the assistant manager, and would need to help me as Bill the manager was to busy. He explained to me that order was put in wrong.  The order was put in as two thin crust pizzas with hamberger and one a tray of mostaccioli.  He offered me $15 for the error.  I explained that I did not get an entire pizza that was more than $15.  He said that is all he could do.  Again I asked to speak to Bill the manager and Bill said he was to busy.  After explaining I needed the money back because the food was not delivered, he said he would issue a store credit for the order. I explained that I just wanted my money back. JT said he did not know how to do a refund, but he would put a refund in later.  As of this morning there is only a charge on my card. I do not understand that a manger can be so busy that he can not get on the phone and take care of a customer with an issue."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I wouldn't go back here. Location is kind of hidden in the back of a shopping center. I had a gift card from restaurant.com and thought this place was worth a try. For one the pizza isn't Chicago deep dish pizza as advertized. It is super thin and not that good at all-tastes like cheap frozen pizza. Service was extremely slow and server kept forgetting basic things like silverware/straws/etc..(granted they seemed to be slammed with only 1 server-hello management). We never got our appetizers until the meal came out and the server was just like oh yea about it. Sure you can get a ton for the prizing (big pizza pies) but it's not noteworthy food or service at all."}
{"text":"For the last year year their food has always been very good but over the last month the food quality has really taken a turn for the worse.   Pizza is like a sprinkle of cheese on a cracker, breadsticks - not even close to what it sounds like - really bad we had to throw out. An Angelhair pasta dish with spinach and mushrooms was so bad, after one bite we threw it out. The pasta tasted like a smoked piece of wood.  Really awful experience. This was not the first in the last month. Both times I could not believe how bad it was. 

The restaurant was closed for over three weeks due to what they called water damage but I really think they lost their chef or owners and have new people running it that have no idea what they are doing. 

Would have been highly recommended until this last month.  We won't go back after this last experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered a couple pizzas for delivery. For the price, this place is pretty average. The customer service when ordering and the speed of delivery were good. However, the quality of the pizza for what they charge leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Does not deserve even one star.

Called placed order for delivery. Gave address and payment information was told 45 minutes.

Called after an hour and told it was on its way.  They call right back to verify my order.

Two hours later I call to find my order and I begin to get quizzed like I was trying to scan them.

They delivered it to the wrong house and the manager wants to know from me how that happen....

Needless to say I never did get pizza.....

Now I am justing waiting to see if I will get a refund!  

Go sell crazy to someone else!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delighted with my pie! Great flavor! Great service! I am definitely eating at Rosati's again on my next visit to Peoria! Truly authentic Chicago-style pizza!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! This is one of the few where everything is made fresh not out of the can like the other Rosati's in town- must try!"}
{"text":"Just spent $11.25 on a nasty salad and a drink. Look at my picture of the lettuce I picked out of it."}
{"text":"I work right next to this awesome pizza shop. Had pizza and pasta here was absolutely amazing!!! Everyone was super friendly and service was on point. Definitely will try more and more."}
{"text":"We have been ordering pizza (delivery) from Rosati's ever since we moved here 10 years ago. It is simply the best medium priced delivery pizza in the whole valley. And they often have coupons (which makes it even more affordable) We are pretty much stuck on the thin crust and usually order the 'classic combo' with meat and veggies. Always fresh, always delivered piping hot, and always yummy. And we don't mind the square cut because I like the outside crust and my husband prefers the inside pieces...perfect!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is very good. So are the dough nuggets, and the portions are extremely generous. Prices are higher than most so be sure to use a coupon which can be found just about anywhere. If you go there to dine-in, don't expect great service because there's always only one person waiting tables and tending bar. But the pizza is some of the best around so it's worth it!"}
{"text":"q Coming here turned out to be A really good idea! Pizza is awesome Chicago style was really good. Mozzarella sticks are so good. Customer service is really great the two girls up front where very patient and walking me through the menu! I would definitely go back and eat there again"}
{"text":"The food here is good.  Everyone in my family has something that they really like here.  The breadsticks are great!  We did have a problem once with a night manager being pretty nasty.  We were really offended so I contacted the owner.  The owner was great and quickly offered to buy us dinner and apologized for the way their manager behaved.  We really appreciated it.  The owner cares.  :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places although abit pricey its worth it. When i go there i always order a small 12 inch pizza with 6 wings and they always cook it to perfection...excellent customer service...servers were super friendly i do recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I USED to love this place, even though it was a bit pricier. However, this most recent experience will prevent me from EVER going back! I called to order 3 16\" pizza's. I also asked if I could use a coupon I had for a free cheese pizza w/the purchase of any 18\" pizza. The man to took my phone order said since I'm ordering 3 pizza's he would make an exception. We get there to pick up our order and they tell me they cannot honor the coupon because I didn't order an 18\" pizza! Never mind that I just spent $75 for 3 pizzas! Oh, and what about the guy that told us he would make an exception? Sorry, but he's gone for the day so... no. OH... and don't bother to call and tell me ahead of time; just wait until I get there and now I'm short on pizza for the group that we had at our house. THE SERVICE AT THIS PLACE COULD NOT BE ANY WORSE! If I were the owner, I'd check out some of these Yelp reviews and do something about it. There are WAY too many pizza places in the Valley to deal w/such poor customer service. SMH."}
{"text":"Rosati's has some really good pizza, but the wait is so long.  One time I forgot they were supposed to deliver it to my house so we drove down there after an hour and 15 mins to pick it up but the green car with one headlights out just left to deliver it.  We were able to pay there and meet our pizza back at my pad.  

But other than Pizza, I like to order the Chief.  They pile meat on top of meat here.  It's so good.  And you get a special dipping sauce as well.  In the past I've had the fried chicken and fries.  They were so crispy and oily greasy, it was good.  Not healthy but I won't deny how good they tasted!  

Inside the restaurant there are some nice good size TV!  Definitely a place I wouldn't mind watching a game while having a bite, it wouldn't be as loud as other places."}
{"text":"Sat on hold for 10 minutes to make an order.  Call the wing stop next door get over to pick up my Wings and Rosati's is empty,  I see why."}
{"text":"Had never tried before and will probably not try again (at least thesame menu item). I ordered 14\" deep dish, just plain cheese. Looked and smelled great, but taste was a whole other thing unfortunately. The crust was dry and not flavorful at all, so when you are done with the cheese/sauce part of the slice you just set it at the edge of your plate. And when eating the pizza it wasn't hot at all, not cold, but not I-need-to-blow-on-this-so-I-don't-burn-my-tongue which is what I love in pizzas. Maybe because I got delivery? 

Delivery was great though. Right within the time frame predicted when I placed my order. And the driver was very friendly."}
{"text":"We are Chicago transplants and love this Rosati's. We order the thin crust and pan pizzas. They are just like the Rosati's in Illinois. I am also a fan of the wings. They are BIG and saucy."}
{"text":"Cheese Ravioli with Alfredo sauce was amazing. For $7 you get about 6 ravioli covered in their amazing sauce and a warm, soft breadstick. VERY filling and perfect portion size. I have a thing for alfredo sauce and this is by far one of the best I've had, not watery and has a ton of flavor! Their pizza is way too pricey for me but I'm def going back for more pasta soon!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to like this place.  It's one of the only casual restaurants in the immediate area.  But the pizza isn't great, everything is expensive for what it is (gourmet bistro prices for sports bar food), we were disappointed by the service, and the ambiance is just blah.  We walked out of there feeling like we should've gone somewhere else but there really wasn't much else to choose from."}
{"text":"Ever have one of those days when you say \" I am not leaving the house again!\" You are so lazy you decide to order pizza from right next door and they deliver it ! It's perfect ! Takes them about 20 mins and BAM dinner is at my door!  The pizza is very heavy and loaded down. It's not my favorite. Kids like it.  But the hamburgers are killer! We order the burger and fries every couple of weeks and it's so good.  I've only had it one time when it was cooked too long and wasn't the same.  The cook changed that day I think. But over all, it's a relief a and you can put your feet up and enjoy a killer burger or pizza. I like it ...I like it a lot"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? Ill start by saying DO NOT EAT HERE! I ordered my food for delivery and tracked the time. It took over an hour for the food to get to my place and I only lived 2 miles away. When it got to about an hr I called in to check on the status of my order and I was greeted with attitude and a young lady named Mary, Marnie, Marie... something like, she was not empathetic or remorseful. When my order finally arrived I opened my bag and it was soaked in spilled opened ranch. It ruined all of my food. There was ranch all over my bread the container,  it was a mess. I was not at all pleased and I haven't even tasted the food. It was NOT good. I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. It was over all a bad experience and waste of money. I took a chance and I should have heeded all the bad reviews on here but I thought what the heck they all can't be right. Too bad they were. Do yourself a favor and steer clear."}
{"text":"The pizza by the slice is bad if you ask me, very thick, and consisting mostly of blandish sourdough -like crust. Like a flat loaf of white bread with prego and some melted string cheese. 

The italian beef ain't bad but it's not exactly spicy either - Dom's is currently my pick to click considering the sad state of italian beef in champaign."}
{"text":"This is easily THE best pizza I've ever had. I've ordered it 3 times this past week! I had a hard time not ordering it again for lunch just now but I decided 4 times in a week probably isn't a good idea. I still may break down and order a pizza for dinner though who knows. Okay I'm not gonna lie, I'm more than likely going to definitely order another pizza from these guys for dinner because of how freaking awesome it is lmao!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service is awful. We'd never go back because of the terrible attitude. They don't have a good selection for pizza for lunch. We work for a big company nearby and will tell everyone never to go come here. EVER."}
{"text":"I WAS a 3 going on 4 years patron of this establishment... Unfortunately, this has come to an abrupt end, because new management/ownership has not been a seamless transition. I Ordered two x-large pies and 24 wings, and while the Pizza was great (seriously) the wings (one flavor) were overtly SALTY! Called to notify, and instead of crediting the account, the lady tells me that they will issue a 10% credit! Excuse me? At which point I inquired about a change in mgmt/ownership, which she confirmed that recent changes had occurred. I asked when an owner would be available and decided to call back to speak with the owner. When I made contact with the owner, things got UGLY! I was told that in order to be issued credit (12.99), I would need to bring the wings back - after spending $81.00! I took every morsel of food (food that had been purchased for a family gathering) back to Rosatis - I was beyond LIVID. Once they checked my telephone number (and thus my history) against their system, they offered a $25 credit to the account or a total refund, neither of which were commensurate with the utter failure of customer care on their part, and thus both declined - I took care of it through the bank. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. Best wishes to the new owners to establish a viable process, unfortunately, they've lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"1 my Chicago favorites, so of course when my family moved to Vegas and we found 1 close by we were all pretty happy. I've been here maybe 3/4 times, my family stops by more since they live here. Well, I don't have any complaints, but no wowzers either. It's more of a 3.5, but they're just not a 4 or 4ish for me to push it. Service has bn ok too. They just seem to suffice. I've only tried a few pizzas, but 1 day I'll try the wings too."}
{"text":"We had been getting takeout from the Rosati's on Wigwam for many years, so we were super excited when we saw they'd be moving in walking distance to our house.
Location: 5 stars

Ambiance: 4 stars. It's clean, but bland. They have (as of yesterday) a liquor license with a full bar inside. Plenty of seating. A few well-placed tvs to watch the game.

Pizza: 4 stars. I like the thin crust but do not like the \"double crust.\" Note to Rosati's: if you want to make a crust that is breadier than thin, please give it some seasoning. It seems crazy, but pizza hut actually has really good seasoning crumbs on the outside of theirs.

Other food: 4 stars. I love the cheesy bread, like the frozen mushrooms (pretty sure they make them in-house). To me, the wings are meh, but my husband likes them. I haven't tried the sandwiches or pasta yet, but I appreciate the varied menu. Will be back soon to check the other offerings.

Price: 3 stars. The pizza is pretty high, considering they are mostly \"regular\" ingredients unlike the fancier cheese and pepperonis down the street at Grimaldi's.

Overall: I'll be back. They are hands down the best option in walking distance right now."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food. I work very close to this location and they are so nice to give my colleagues and I discounts because of the fact I work for a local business. I love when I call how friendly they all are and how when we call they get the orders done quickly. No complaints! Great manager, very attentive to detail & the pizza is phenomenal. Love the thin crust!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience that I've had with customer service. The girl working at the front Christina told me the pizza would be done in 30-40 min I show up early, pay and wait. When I get there 20min after I called they had not even started the pizza.They forgot I was sitting there and after waiting an hour I get up to asked about my order only to find out it had been done and sitting. I asked for lite veggies and lite sauce . The pizza was soaked in sauce and full of veggies. I call and speak to manager Gus he offered no apologies and when done with conversation slams the phone down. I call back to asked for a different manager and Christian says \"I don't know what your problem is\"....she refused to give me her name and told me that's what managers are for (Gus provided her name)...I can go on and on but the jist of the story is Neverrrrrrrr again!!!! #rude #classless #people running this restaurant! It's too costly to not have first class customer service."}
{"text":"This location of Rosati's is great. We've been going here for years. Have had quite a few of the menu items from salads, pastas, beef sandwiches and the thin crust pizza. Haven't had deep dish or double crust. The food is consistently good. Only have had a couple average beef sandwiches and one pizza that was a little more salty than usual. Other than that it's a great place. It's mostly takeout but they do deliver. When the delivery arrives the pizza is piping hot. My husband usually goes to pick up the pizza. If he has our little dog with him he carries her in and the staff comes out to greet her. They know her by name and notify the kitchen that she's here and sometimes the workers in the back will bring her some sausage. Now please don't call the health department she doesn't leave his arms.   Like the previous reviewer stated they do send out coupons if you're in the area.   You can also print out coupons on the \"Clipper Marketplace\" and if you use \"Zone 13\" you will find their coupons.   You can keep printing them out as needed."}
{"text":"Delivery can take a while, but BEST Italian Beef in town!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I have been going to Rosati's forever.  I am from Chicago so I was so excited to find one in Las Vegas!  The Italian Beef sandwiches are the best!  Now that I have moved to LA hoping they will open one up here!  It is a must whenever I visit Vegas or Chicago:)"}
{"text":"Yum! Favorite new pizza joint in the neighborhood! Great friendly service and delicious pizza"}
{"text":"Insanely horrible. For starters, I must get the same ditz answering the phone every time I place an order for delivery. My order has NEVER been correct. My calzones have always been made wrong (either adding or leaving out an ingredient or two), I have had items added to my ticket without me ordering it and I have had items left off my ticket. The delivery drivers are always late and they always seem to slide my pizza around so that it's always messed up. And now let's talk about their pizza...the thin crust is always so insanely soggy that it actually sticks to the pizza box. Not to mention their sausage is nasty. They also don't cut it all the way and the sauce is horrible. 

As someone who lived in Chicago and was personal family friends with the founder of Rosati's, I know that the Family would be embarrassed to see this quality, or lack thereof, be handed to a customer."}
{"text":"Probably the best delivery pizza around.   Consistently good.  I've been ordering from them for years.  Some say a bit more pricey than others but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We love the food here and we've tried most everything.  Mostly we go in because of Rosie.  Always a big smile when she sees us every week.  She knows the wine we drink and serves it up right away and she'll make suggestions and we've never been disappointed.  Not sure what has been going on there, but the atmosphere seems a little strained lately and the kitchen has been getting slower."}
{"text":"Rosati's has the best thin crust pizza that I have yet to find in Arizona (and being from Chicago, I have high standards). This location is delivery/carry out only and can make a pie in about 20 minutes from the time you order it (plenty of time to wander around one of the stores in the strip mall it's located in). 

The service was good- the phone was answered within a few rings to place our order and we were greeted immediately upon entering the location. If you look a good thin crust pizza, this is the place to try. Oh, and their sausage is pretty great too :)"}
{"text":"Pretty bad pizza! The deep dish was horrible and the delivery time was over an hour. The crust was stale and even the cheese was off. I would not recommend this reference."}
{"text":"Update from previous review\" The manager called and apologized and made a gesture to try them again. We took the leap and tried it. It was superior!! The food was prepared well. Toppings were bountiful. We were very impressed and will keep ordering Rosati's for the family~
Thank you for the follow up"}
{"text":"Having never tried Rosati's before, I was eager to see what the buzz was about. So, my friends and I ordered some food which we would later pick up. As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see that there was a cleverly named \"Veggie Wrap\" on the menu, so I ordered it. When I finally got home with my food and started to dig in, I instantly noticed that my wrap smelled of beef!!! I speculated that the restaurant was not world-class, and as such, grilled their supposed \"Vegetarian-friendly\" fare on the same grill as their meat products, instantly losing authenticity. Sure enough, after calling, I found out I was right. A young lady picked up the phone, and after asking her about their procedure for making wraps, an elderly man picked up the phone, and simply said \"what up\". After explaining to him that I don't eat meat, and that world-standards state vegetarian food be naturally, free of meat or meat by-products, he proceeded to tell me he had \"never heard of a vegetarian\" and he \"doesn't know what that means\". He continued to argue with me, and   later refused to remake my Veggie Wrap because it would \"cost him a couple dollars\". I told him I could not eat it, and I would like to be reimbursed, He then uttered a slur, which I don't care to repeat, and told me to go elsewhere. Needless to say, this restaurant is clearly at the bottom of the heap in more ways than one and, frankly, is a lawsuit waiting to happen. If you are vegetarian, a minority, or just looking for an honest local pizzeria to patronize, I beg of you to steer clear of this ever-struggling establishment."}
{"text":"Originally went here because of a restaurant.com certificate.

The place was busy, but we received great service from our servers, and the food was good.

We had the thin crust Monster pizza - yum!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, fast, and really good pizza.  The guy who helped us at the front counter was very quick, almost had a sixth sense when it came to customers.

Was able to use their $10 for $5 voucher with no problem at all, and they were open Christmas eve.

Will be coming here the next time we want pizza!

Did I mention their pizza is awesome?!?"}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza thin and square cut with a great sauce with a touch of bite to it. If I am in Phoenix again I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"People love this place.  I am just not a fan of their pizza.  Then again, I am an ex-New Yorker!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo delicious. Service is chill and good, the first pizza place that has asked if we needed paper plates and napkins in years :,) 

Haven't tried the Chicago-style pizza yet, have only had calzones and sides, but we can't wait to try a pie! Wings are awesome and very saucy!! Thank you Rosatis"}
{"text":"Paid for fries and got nasty soggy mushrooms so upset. Pizza was decent. Probably won't order again."}
{"text":"Food was great, we had buffalo wings, chicken tenders, a large deep dish pizza and a couple orders of ravioli. 

Service was not so great. VERY SLOW. We weren't sure if this was a self seating restaurant and the busser just walked passed us avoiding eye contact, so we sat down. Server greeted us right away but then drinks took about 15 min and they were only waters and iced tea. Food took as long as expected, 40 min wait for a deep dish (extra baking time we were warned about when ordered). However, once we were done eating our server didn't come back from behind the bar, she turned off the open sign 7 min before 9pm which is their closing time, which required her to pass our table and she never stopped to check if we were ready for boxes or dessert. The busser that ignored us earlier suddenly started to help us, offered us boxes and then we Waited for the bill, we waited for them to pick up the bill, we waited for it to be processed. Service was just too slow."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail for a free pizza and they wouldn't honor it. I'd be more upset if they were better than second rate."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the bottom line is this.  The food, espically the pizza, is very good.  The service is very bad.  

A friend and myself went on Saturday night and we had to get our own drinks a few times and our server dropped off the check right after we got our pizza.  I have worked in multiple kitchens here in town and something was going on for sure in the back, but the pizza was still very good.  I don't know what was going on with the service, but this is what I expect from this location.  

I recommend picking up."}
{"text":"The pizza must be frozen pizza, it tasted like frozen pizza.  Dry crust and bad sauce, the cheese was separate from the crust,  I shouldn't of trusted a pizza place where you can't get a fresh one slice of pizza"}
{"text":"Update: our last several times have been great service-wise and the food is still really good. We want to be fair and recognize the improvement

Food is really good, but the service is awful! We have had orders incorrect, and they couldn't care much less. There is a young blond girl who is especially disconnected and lacks any kind of ownership of issues. The kids that work in here act like entitled brats. Thankfully, the kitchen staff seems to know what they're doing. We would rate this highly if not for the jerky kids up front."}
{"text":"I called in an order, and ordered a burger and said I'd like cheese on it. Well thats exactly what they did, put cheese on it and NOTHING ELSE. this time they delivered this RAW burger, without fries (they didnt ask and I didnt order them). they came late though we live 2 minutes away, then had an attitude and kept saying \"its 9:00 and we are closing\" even though we ordered at 7:30. its a good thing I cant figure out how to post this picture"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and if you ever lived there you would know that most pizza in Chicago is NOT deep dish. The other locations have not been that great, but this location is putting out some pretty good pizza. We order some strange combinations and they have gotten it right every time. Just got 2 last night and no complaints at all. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"New owner's rock Rosati's! This location was going to hell in a hand basket. The new owner's have successfully resuscitated it! 

I had stopped going to Rosati's several years ago after repeated bad service, rude un - knowledgeable employee's, and lifeless products! Also I had inquired with the previous owner about doing a 400.00 catering order that I needed delivered by 11:15am. He told me they do not open until 11am so he wouldn't be able to do it! UGH what a stugots! 

Anyway on to the new. I received a fax that the ownership had changed and I thought what the heck, I will give it a shot. Some co-workers decided they wanted in. GO figure isn't that always how it is. 

I ordered the baked Mostaccioli lunch special it comes with a can of whatever Coke product you like. I added two meatballs. Plus a garlic bread stick. Total 7.50! Not bad at all I thought. Well it was a bargain and a half the dish is HUGE! It comes in a 9inch Togo pan! I shared with a co worker and still have tomorrow's lunch covered as well! The meatballs are very very good and I am damn picky about my meatball's. Just the right amount of marinara, noodles al dente, and covered in melted mozzarella! They got this dish right. 

My coworkers got the meatball sandwich's, that sucker is huge too! Smothered in melted mozzarella with fries and a coke 5.70! 

It was delish! I will be back. To try many other items, I will keep you posted. Almost forgot they have Eli's Cheesecake!!!!!! Note there is no dining in it is all carry out or delivery. 

4 stars for the food quality, the 5th star is for the portion to price! 
The menu is huge so check them out on-line. www.rosatisonthomas.com"}
{"text":"The 2 hot dog combo is a great deal - Chicago-style dogs are so expensive around here, so 2 dogs, really good fries and a drink for $6 works for me.  I also tried the Italian Beef and it was just right - just like home.  Our service was excellent both times we've visitied.  I would go five stars, but this weekend my wife ordered the \"double dough\" pizza and I tried it - pretty disapointingly dry bland crust.  I'm certainly going to try the deep-dish sometime...maybe I'll change my review after that - 5star if it's great and down to 3 if it stinks."}
{"text":"I've been to Rosati's plenty of times before (never this location), any my experience has never been this bad.  I called in a carry out order at 4:30 pm (This is well before the dinner rush).  The girl taking the call doesn't take my name and unceremoniously hangs up on me after saying the pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  I show up at 4:55pm, and say to the girl at the counter \" I am here to pick up a carry out order\".  She asks my name and I tell her the girl on the phone didn't ask my name.  She responds, \"oh yeah, I didn't\".  She checks on my pizza and tells me it going to be another 5 minutes.  Fine, I pay and sit down on the bench out front.  I can over hear what sounds like 5 - 6 teenagers talking loud about energy drinks and their work schedules.  By the way they were cursing I imagine they either forgot I was up front or do not care.  The girl at the counter came back at 5:05 to tell me my pizza is almost out and it shouldn't be more than 5 minutes.  She then leaves to go to Albertsons.  I am not high school math teacher but I know it takes longer than 5 minutes to walk to Albertsons, pick out your energy drinks, pay for them, then walk back to Rosatis.  But all of that happened before my pizza came out.  5:15 pm my pizza is ready.  That's 45 minutes on a slow night.  I've worked in pizza places before and know it doesn't take that long to cook a pizza.  All would have been forgiven had the pizza actually been cooked.   When I got home the family sat down and to eat and were surprised by crunchy (uncooked) onions, and extremely under cooked dough.  I'm wondering why I game them $28 for one of my worst pizza experiences ever.  

Let me restate this, we normally LOVE Rosati's pizza, but this is our first time visiting this location.  It will also be our last.  I'd much rather pay half that price and get a better product from Barro's across the street.  Maybe the Roasti's in Chandler will be better..."}
{"text":"This place just screams real Chicago. .from doing what they did best back in Chicago providing exellent pizza n pasta..wings to die for..and they have pick up or delivery. .the crew rocks..a bunch of happy people so that's why the food is good..I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants great pizza..love the price too!!!!!!"}

{"text":"We recently placed a delivery order for some pizza, our friend told us they had Chicago style pizza so we ran with it.  

It has been awhile since I have had Chicago style pizza I had forgotten how utterly over whelming it can be.  The pizza must have weighed 15 pounds and was over an inch thick with crust and toppings.  One piece and I was stuffed so three pieces in for the three of use and we are only slightly over 1/4 done!  Guess I'm having cold pizza for breakfast!  

It was spendy but the toppings were generous and tasty, the delivery time reasonable."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood pizza place! Best chicago thin crust around! Always great service."}
{"text":"We've had the catered food of pasta, fried chicken, beef sandwiches, and salad. Everything was hot, fresh, and ready to serve. Everyone loved the food and was surprised when we told them it was from a pizza place. Their pizzas are always hot, fresh, and loaded with toppings. We even bought one of the deep dish frozen pizzas for later and it turned out great, better than any store bought frozen pizza!"}
{"text":"I love this Rosati's! The owner is so nice...always makes me feel like family! He will make whatever you want for lunch! I usually go at a later lunch time (2-ish) and I like a certain salad and he will make it to order, happily! Thanks, Rosati's! Oh, I love their chopped antipasto, too...the thing is huge!"}
{"text":"This is Chicago style pizza, and if you are from Chicago you will like this pizza. The red sauce is very thick and very salty, the crust is almost bread like. Most of the people complaining on the site, don't seem to know the difference between New York style and Chicago style pizza. If do you like Chicago style pizza, this is one of the few places in town to get it. Yes the service is not great, but the product is good."}
{"text":"Traveled from Payson to Scottsdale today, 10/7/15, to enjoy some good Chicago thin crust pizza. Being from Chicago and very familiar with Rosati's from \"back home\" we felt very comfortable in choosing Rosati's Sports Pub. The restaurant has a nice bar area (would be a fun place to hang out if we lived in the neighborhood) as well as a great outdoor patio.  We chose the bar area because they were having some minor work done outside.  Our server was Crystal who was also the bartender. She was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Our pizza was wonderful...sausage, pepperoni, black olives and green peppers...just perfect!! I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir, which was very good, but I felt $10 was a bit overpriced. Both the cook and the owner came to our table to ask how we liked the pizza...which I thought was a nice touch. I mentioned to Crystal that I was from Chicago so i think they wanted to make sure the food was up to a Chicagoan's high standards...lol! Had a nice conversation with the owner as well. He really seems to want to be an exceptional restaurant. The only negative was the Tiramisu. I knew it wasn't made fresh on site but it was not good!  Parts of it were still frozen and other parts were too soggy. I would not recommend it. Hubby and I will be back to try their $6.00 lunch specials....especially the Beef and Meatball sandwiches...looking forward to it. Give Rosati's a try if you like Thin Crust Chicago pizza...I think you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Calzone is undercooked and plain. Would never eat if I didn't just pay $40 for six measly boneless wings, a soggy calzone, and dessert. What a joke."}
{"text":"The Chicago deep dish pepperoni was great. The house salad could have been better but average.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"The pastas are a hit - the carbonara is covered with the angriest, most intimidating chunks of bacon I've ever seen. Cheesy smokey bacon heaven. The garlic breadsticks are yummy, too.

If your service sucks or you have a bad experience, try tipping more. This holds true to just about any restaurant. 

Behold the power of the 30% tip.

To recap: I know no one that works here, have only ordered here 4 times, and they treat me like a close friend when I call.

My food gets here incredibly quick (20 - 30 minutes when they quote an hour) and they usually hook me up with free delivery and little odds and ends they think I'd like (free mozzarella sticks, some breaded mushrooms)."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and fettuccine Alfredo. Had the combination pizza and it was one of the best thin crust I have had. My wife was very pleased with the tender and tasty noodles. Great creamy taste of the sauce. Will be back for more. We did take out and had great service."}
{"text":"This pizza is phenomenal, and I once ate pizza at least 4 days a week for almost a year (not proud, just establishing credibility...). The sauce is a perfect mix between salty garlic and sweet, and the stuffed crust not only was succulent, but I was full after two slices.

Looks like there are some service concerns on other reviews (I didn't have any but it happens), but if you're looking for good pizza...these guys do good pizza."}
{"text":"Phoenix has pretty slim pickings when it comes to good pizza, or at least pizza that I'm accustomed to.  Rosati's, while not quite what I'm used to, is the best representation of Chicago style pizza that I've found.  

The Chicago style deep dish is good.  The toppings, especially the sausage, are plentiful and tasty and the sauce is good.  I think the crust is what is a bit off.  

Overall, Rosati's is still my choice for pizza in the valley."}
{"text":"Agh! This is the only place you can get baked ziti in Madison like I could get on Long Island. I love it! Of course it isn't called baked ziti, but it's the same darned thing. I've been there twice in a row, and it's absolutely delicious. Their marinara is really fresh and good, too.

The pizza however isn't so hot."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas this week and from Chicago, saw Rosatis and was glad I could have good pizza so far from where the best pizza is. Guy on the phone didn't provide good service, seemed very annoyed and at times I couldn't even understand him. Pizza delivery cake very fast and the delivery guy was very nice, good service from him. Pizza is was great, needs oregano, but still very good. Would order again sometime, hopefully someone else will answer the phone."}
{"text":"Update October 14 - 

This has become a terrible place, horrid service and terrible delivery. Stick to any other place.

They still have fantastic food, but it's about more than that when you order somewhere.

2013 Review

This was a good pizza and I'm very glad I stopped here.

I always go by here, and somehow they always drop flyers off everywhere I am. So on a whim I decided to try Rosati's. The reviews on here left me rather worried I would end up regretting this decision, but I took a chance.

Ordered their lunch special 10 in personal pizza and wow did it have flavor. The crust was great, the sauce good, but the cheese seemed to be cooked and seasoned perfectly.

I took my order to go, so I can't speak to the service inside. I can say it took a while to cook the pizza - 30 minutes to be exact, which I wasn't a fan of, but at least it was good.

Stop in and grab a pizza, its worth it and I will definitely be back. Oh, and when you check in through Yelp you get a 25% off your order coupon so check in before you order."}
{"text":"My usual order is a thin crust large pep. They cut it in squares usually but you can request a standard pie cut. Now the pizza is pretty good if youre looking for thin crust. Tasty sauce. Friendly staff always. Delivery comes at a honest time. Which is good because ive had places tell me 30 min and they take a hour long. I really have no complaints about the place. But it doesnt get 5 stars because i just cant say its my favorite place. But it sure gets a strong 4!"}
{"text":"I ate pasta with mushrooms here and the mushrooms smelt like my ex girls moldy pussy. These other reviews are the truth!!!dont eat here... Don't eat here... Don't eat here (unless you want an std, cause I'm sure that's what the place will give you)."}
{"text":"So, during a tearful day of dropping off my youngest at college, we stopped here for lunch, in an attempt to stop my sobbing. Dang, it was pretty good. We ordered Italian beef sandwiches ( with cheese, if you please) and a calzone with pepperoni. The Italian beef was like, great. We ended up waiting a bit for the calzone, but great koogley moogley, it was huge and  really good. It's crazy reasonable , too. I'm not sure the pizza slices are all that, but they look ok. So there ya go."}
{"text":"Did not realize that they have a new dine-in area with three booths, three tables, and 4 flat screens.   Great little spot to catch a game on a lunch break.  Italian beef sandwich with Giardiniera peppers was one of the best I have had in Phoenix.  Kelli was a great server.  This will be a weekly lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"In this suburban area of North Phoenix / Cave Creek the choices for carry-out pizza are Barro's (diagonally across the street), Pizza Hut, and Domino's (both a couple of miles north). If you've never been to Barro's, think sugary sauce. Come to think of it, the same is true of Dominos. So far I've tried only the \"traditional Italian crust\" pizza at Rosatis, and I found it to be very good. This is primarily a carry-out / delivery location, but there are a few seats inside, as well as a flat screen TV to watch while you're waiting. They have pizza by the slice on weekdays until 3pm."}
{"text":"We had the Hawaiian pizza the other night. I gave it two stars only because it was ready on time.  It was the 18 inch, but did not have enough cheese or anything else to be the smallest size.  The crust was  one of the worst I have ever had.
I grew up in Chicago; this was advertised as a Chicago style pizza.Except for the checkerboard cutting, no way!
Worst of all, it cost almost $20!"}
{"text":"I ordered penne pasta with Alfredo sauce for pick up.  Not that I was expecting much because the service is always horrible, but the food is usually OK so its easy to look past poor service.  The Alfredo sauce had a layer of oil on top of it so much that I had to pour as much of it out as I could before eating it. Needless to say, I won't be returning.  The food is no longer worth the service. I'd rather drive the extra distance and go to Vit's pizza up the street where there is friendly service and quality food."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at work eating lunch from Rosati's as I type this review. Another lunch paid for by the bosses. This time they switched it up and got some sandwiches along with our usual pizza and garlic bread order. I've mentioned the soggy pizza before. We ordered a veggie pizza. I wish I had my camera because when I went to take a slice, the superthin soggy crust buckled and left about a pound of cheese and veggies sitting in the box. Yes it's great that they give you lots of toppings but do they realize their crust cannot handle this?? I'm talking a 10:1 toppings to crust weight ratio here... 

The garlic bread topped with cheese/tomatoes/spinach is decent. Nothing you could not make at home. I tried the chicken parm sub as well, it was tasty after I removed about half of the chicken. They overfilled it with chicken and cheese, and there was not enough sauce. It was more like a hot chicken/cheese sub. This place and Barro's are the two closest pizza places to my office. And despite my complaints about Rosati's, I will take it (for free, would never pay for either place!) over Barro's any day."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. They offered to remake a pizza for me that I ordered wrong & they absolutely did not have to do that for me. 10/10 very impressed. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've had both pizza and fried chicken from this Rosati's and was always very impressed.  The pizza was hot, tasty, and didn't scrimp on the toppings. The chicken was always like good tavern chicken, plump and juicy.

Not this time.  

I ordered my favorite four piece chicken dinner to go via phone.  It was not the plump and delicious chicken I've had in the past.  The chicken was very greasy... it was dripping off.  It was also scrawny with a lot of fat.  I couldn't finish it.  The fries were cold and also greasy.  

Customer service? What customer service?  There were two behind the counter in a personal conversation.  After I was finally acknowledged, he couldn't decide which order was mine.  There was only one to choose from.  No conversation... just \"$8.80\". He gave me my change with no thank you.  Then turned around and walked off.

Now I need to find a new place to get my fried chicken."}
{"text":"Placed an online order and after over an hour of waiting did not get any updates or a phone call on whether or not there was a problem. Then when I tried calling multiple times they hung up or just let the line ring until the call timed out. Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"this was my first time coming here and it will be my last! my chicago deep dish pizza was not cooked thoroughly! The pizza was uncooked in the middle. I could literally make dough balls out of the uncooked dough. It was disgusting and the worst experience of deep dish pizza ever. A waste of $35. What a donation -__-"}
{"text":"I ordered from Rosati's for the first time in a couple years and the pizza is still just fine (this time I went for The Veggie) but what I really wanted were good breadsticks. I'd never tried theirs, but figured since they had decent crust, a decent breadstick would follow. Unfortunately, logic failed me in this department. 

The price of the breadsticks on the menu were cheap ($2.99), and the quality followed suit. I'm convinced that they are not made in-house, as they were extremely bland and had that spongy, white-bread quality you'd find in a plastic-wrapped package you'd pick up in the grocery store. Another menu item, Nuggets, are billed as pieces of crispy pizza dough tossed in garlic butter sauce. Those go for $6.49, and should have tipped me off that the breadsticks were probably not the best choice. 

The upside in the long run is that I'll have consumed less bread, but giving me SyscoStix (my own name that I wouldn't be at all surprised to find is a real product) instead of just cutting up some pizza dough was a star-dropping move. What else can't they be bothered to make?"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Rosati's for the past 4 months and we've never had a bad meal. The thin crust \"Classic Combo\" is our favorite and it absolutely mouthwatering. Freshly made, lots of meat.... and flavorful sauce. The staff are very busy, but very personable and always have a smile on their face. They have great coupons and give a military discount if you ask. First rate all the way."}
{"text":"Pretty damn dissapointed. I love thin crust pizza and some hot wings which is what I ordered at rosati's. Both the wings and pizza were overdone. The wings were dry as a bone and the pizza barely had any sauce at all.

I would not recommend at all. If you want really good thin crust pizza do yourself a favor and go to Windy City Beefs N Pizza."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I thought the pizza was excellent.  I would go back again for sure!  There was no mold by the way. ;)"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would at 619 pm checked the time on my phone we ordered pizza and wings, hour later received the wrong pizza ordered another the manager was sending. At 8:50 pm got a call that there was a accident that would not allow delivery, the onsite manager said there was no corporate number and that our issues didn't matter.  Rude, sorry our driver had to slam on his breaks and cheese slide and will have to make it again. Really 3 hours later maybe we will get a pizza that we paid cash for the first time. Husband on phone at 8:59 still at the moment wow pathetic order somewhere else Im telling you"}
{"text":"Forget being Chicago pizza, this barely qualifies as pizza.  Does anyone in the restaurant even taste the food? The sauce was so bitter that I could barely stand to chew the food, the cheese left oil slicks that rival that of the Valdez, and usually came off in one soggy mess when you took a bite.  Not to mention the fact that they cut a round pizza into about 30 tiny little squares, great if you're serving a bunch of little kids, as an adult I'm looking to get a slice of pizza.  Save yourself some time, there are plenty of great options around other than this."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and I really like the \"back east\" feel to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Grub Hub. Pizza arrived 2 hours later and cold. Totally not worth the money. I called because the site said the pizza had already arrived. The Godfather pizza was really very gross- WAY too many onions and was worse because it was cold. Never ordering here again and definitely won't waste my time to actually visit the restaurant. The only reason I'm giving it so two stars is because the cannoli was yummy. #Disappointment"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!  Serious pizza for thin and deep dish lovers.  Best pizza in Vegas.  Try the awesome wings and beef too!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!   One of the delivery drivers was extremely rude to me when I was trying to order takeout.. I couldn't make a decision right away and took a couple of minutes deciding and he made rude comments about how other people were waiting and I shouldn't be at the counter unless I knew what I wanted.. I told him I only needed a minute or two to decide and had a couple questions about a menu item.. he was extremely overbearing and rude and when I asked to speak to the manager the manager did not say a thing, he did not apologize for his drivers behavior, and the driver was standing in the doorway smiling and laughing as a manager was telling me do you want to order or what?? I told the manager I can't believe that you allow your employees to treat someone like this and that you treat a potential customer this way I will not be going back and will be encouraging everyone I know not to go to this location.
 As for the food I can't tell you if it was good or not.. because I'm not going to give my business to a place that allows customers to be treated like this... avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"We ordered the 8:00 special & they wanted to charge us extra for taking ingredients off of a pizza.  We argued with them for several minutes & they finally offered not to charge us extra.  We had been ordering the same way for a few months & never had any problems.  I won't lie, their pizza is good, but because of how they treated us in this one incident, we will never go back.  Barros is just as good & cheaper.  I definitely think Rosati's pizza is too expensive.  I remembered when they first opened & the current owner's Dad was there & was helping financially with the business & was hoping it went well.  Well, Dad, if they continue to treat their customers they way they treated us, they won't go far.  On any given day, you can see more cars at Barros, which is just across the street, then you see at Rosati's.  They also have a heavy take out service as I witnessed when we went there (talking about Barros) so you have heavy competition.  Rosati's, you better treat your customers right!"}
{"text":"It really pains me to drop not 1, but 2 stars off of my previous review.  What it all boils down to is inconsistency, and in more than one area.  I'll start with the least of the issues.

I've heard that Rosati's takes the Passport card, which gives a 20% discount on the total bill.  Awesome!  Accept... it's only certain ones?  I think that's kind of weird.  I can't remember which location in Chandler takes it, but the one off of Ray & McQueen doesn't.  When I asked about why others take it and others don't, I got kind of a snobby response of \"Probably because those are franchises.  This is family owned.\"  Personally, I don't think that should matter.  You both have the same name on the front of your store.  

That is a minor issue, which I could overlook, but combined with the inconsistency of their pizza, makes for a 'salty' customer.

On my previous review, I stated how the pizza tasted great, until it sat overnight in the fridge, thus gaining a salty flavor.  That wasn't enough to stop me from getting this pizza again.  However this time, the saltiness was apparent from right out of the box.  From the very first bite, my mouth was overwhelmed with the saltiness.  It wasn't so bad that we couldn't eat it, but it was enough where it really over shadowed the other flavors that were so wonderful last time.

Also, this time the crust seemed greasier than last time, which also isn't a trait of true Chicago style pizza.

I gave it a fair shot twice, and both times I wasn't 100% satisfied.  Time to move on."}
{"text":"I am a total pizza snob and I have never left a 5 star review for any restaurant, until now.  This pizza was absolutely perfect and I think it was the best pie I have ever eaten.  Yes, I have had ALL of the Chicago pies.  Absolutely perfect and delightful.  Shout out to Jesse that took my order, he was super busy and answered all of my questions without rushing me, nice job Sir!
Great pizza!!  Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, I know it's not really \"Chicago style\" but considering all of the bad pizza places here,  it is pretty good for Las Vegas. It was a little pricey and could have had more sauce but is still better than most."}
{"text":"Contrary to what most people think - Chicago pizza's are not all deep dish pies! I like the occasional deep dish but mainly prefer the thin crust that I grew up with.

When I moved to greater Chicagoland, Rosati's was my most frequently ordered, as it was very close to my favorite small-town pizza joint. This place is true to its roots.

Rosati's has great pizza and if you visit the store, the staff treats you very well as others have noted. The Big Cheef is an incredible Italian beef that I get when I'm really hungry. I recommend adding tomatoes, sweet peppers and some sauce! My wife and daughter love the lasagna.

You won't be able to get one of those $10 pies the chains are battling over but the pizza from Rosati's will blow those guys away any day."}
{"text":"Decided to order a pie from here instead from the usual Domino's for a U.F.C. fight night at my brother's house.  We ordered the pie two sausage and mushroom.  It took a little over an hour to get there.

I paid the extra money to get the \"better crust\"  I just didn't know that it meant it was the harder crust.  I never had a piece of pizza so hard to chew.  My brother asked me how much I paid for this and when I told him he smirked.   Like Vince Vaughn said in Wedding Crashers it's hard to make a bad pizza, but this place did it.  With so many options here in Vegas I would never try there pie again."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant with so many options! Whether you want pizza, salads, pasta or wraps they have it all with such good options! Fairly priced and it's great that they deliver! I have never had a bad experience with this restaurant and would definitely recommend them to a friend! I will be returning here!"}
{"text":"Descent food, nothing to special or great about it... Had a \"lunch special\" sign out front for 1 or 2 slices of pizza and soda for 4.50$ or 6.50$ but once inside she said they had no individual slices , just whole pizzas. Ok, so maybe bring the sign in ?????? I'm not a cheapskate but 16.95 for a 12\" pepperoni pizza is pricey. If I'm gonna pay that much I'm gonna go to a REAL Italian fine dinning restaurant. Friendly but SLOW service as well."}
{"text":"I order from these guys all the time! Their dough nuggets are to die for! And it's a ton of food, I usually snack on them throughout the week, or I order if I'm having a party for sure. Their italian beef sandwich is amazing and I have to try not to think about it or i'll order it. It comes with fry's and a delicious dipping sauce. I've ordered pizza here as well and it's definitely good, but the sadwhiches can't be beat! The staff seems nice, only see them at my door. But I've never had any issues with them. Always delivery in a timely manner!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago deep dish! Awesome find in NV. Only recommendation  is  more sauce on top to make the pies more authentic. Overall very good!"}
{"text":"We've had pizza from this place, in the past, but it was from the Henderson location (my FIL introduced us to their deep dish pizza- dang it is very heavy- I can only handle a single slice, along with a side serving of salad). 

We had a birthday promotion to use last month- free thin crust cheese pizza (cut into squares) with any minimum purchase of $15.00, so we also got an order of chicken fingers, came with the- creamiest- ever- Ranch dressing (I suspect it was buttermilk, because it was really good) (*I think that there were five to this appetizer order*) and a calzone, which came with dipping sauce (canadian bacon + ricotta- it is $7 for the calzone and a $1.00 for each topping). My favorite was the calzone, so glad that we had leftovers to enjoy, too. 

There was a communication hurdle because the person on the other end of the line wasn't quite well-versed, but when the lady was put on the line, all was good. ((*The promotion code is not near the name of the restaurant but in another spot of the printed email, FYI.*)) 

Everything was yummy. The thin crust pizza was flavorful (*I guess, we were surprised because this one specializes in deep dish pizza*); I usually add red pepper for an extra little kick. The chicken tenders were not heavily breaded (lots of restaurants miss the mark on this simple item, but that was not the case here). Our picky eater loves pizza and chicken; if he doesn't eat it, that means, he does not like it. He ate it, if you are wondering, hahaha.  

Not a sit-down restaurant, does takeout and delivery. There were other promotions on the coupons that were attached to the pizza box, as well as the receipt, *mention it*, when ordering by telephone. Glad we found this one near our home."}
{"text":"This place is getting only one star because of the service. It doesn't matter what kinda product you sell if your service is this bad. My check-in says it all. Been waiting over an hour for pizza they said would be done in 25-30 mins. We have guest waiting at home and no apologies, no discount. Just a girl laughing at the fact it was going to take longer. What a joke. I would love to have a public apology and some kinda compensation."}
{"text":"The firs Italian place we visited upon moving to the area. Lots of parking in the strip mall area. The inside is clean and spacious yet intimate. Super friendly and courteous severs/bartender. Dallas really made our visit memorable and signed us up for the reward program. I had a salad with their house sweet Italian and it was great! Not too sweet and vinegary with a hint of tang. We started with the garlic cheese bread and we knew we had something special. Melty cheese did not overpower the garlic so it was the best of both worlds. The deep dish takes a while to bake but it is so worth it. Nice thick dough and medium soft crust with pepperoni and tomatoes, just as Deep dish should be! For our drinks we got the Al Capone (old fashioned) just enough bitters, not too much! They have free WiFi so that helped as we had not yet set up our internet. We will for sure be back- 5 star service, food, drinks, and a nice Chicago atmosphere with intimate Henderson feel"}
{"text":"WHAT!! Worst meal I've ever had in Las Vegas. Bar none... I had the Chicago Style deep dish and it was all bread!!! There was no filling of toppings. What a joke. Only a jerk that wants to save money and get a quick bite would take his girlfriend here."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and thought let's give this place a try. Bottom line -we will not be back. Owner-please take note-you need to speed up the service and the kitchen. I consider this a casual restaurant and it took 15 minutes to get a green salad and 50 minutes to get dinner. After waiting almost an hour, we took our dinner home. Now i have lost my appetitite, so maybe we will eat the leftovers tomorrow night. What a waste of time and money. I hate to write bad reviews, owning restaurants myself for 15 years, but please read your reviews and change the way that you are doing business. We would love to find a nice, small, affordable Italian restaurant that one could get dinner in 10-15 minutes. Restaurant is pricey for the simple food fare too."}
{"text":"Their pizza by the slice is absolutely trash, tasted like a sponge with pizza sauce on it. Their crust is hard to the rock and lacks any taste. 1.8/10 wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy"}
{"text":"Good Place. Ordered delivery. We got a salad and cheese pizza. Both were delicious and big."}
{"text":"The lasagna is incredible. Enough for a couple to split. The wings are just as good. Lucky we live down the street. Oh...bomb pizza. The monster will knock your eye out. Thank You. Good stuff."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for... great food! I'm a big fan of Rosati's but have never been to this one. First off, the store is updated, clean, and inviting. They even have a fridge of take home pizza to cook in your own oven, as well as bottles of marinara sauce. We definitely want to try next time! Plus, the employee working was very kind and helpful. He
The pizza might be on the expensive side (compared to Little Caesar's or Papa John's) but it is well worth it. The thin crust is to die for! I also ordered cinnamon sticks and breadsticks. Both were delicious and came in a surprisingly large box for the price! The cinnamon sticks are some of the best I've ever had. Look for coupons in the mail to get a great deal!"}
{"text":"The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because I am comparing it to Giordano's in Chicago. IT just does not compare. There are very limited Chicago Style Pizza restaurants here in Vegas and this one just does not hit the nail on the head."}
{"text":"I love there food. . Customer service is outstanding. We take out at least twice a month the food is as good as eating in. .. The bar service is outstanding. Always enjoy my dinner time there. I recommend if you ever want great tasting food. This is the place to go"}
{"text":"Pizza here is decent but a bit overpriced. And counter service has sucked sometimes. 

They do have good lunch specials. I tried a slice of their white pizza for lunch and it was really yummy."}
{"text":"Great drinks and a family owned business. Stayed till close and everyone was hospitable. Pizza was pretty good. Small bar and everyone knows everyone. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I love Rostais Pizza and this location just can't get it right. Next time I want Rostais I will drive the extra 5 miles for a different location. They don't know how to cook a true Rostais Pizza."}
{"text":"Close to our house, Rosati's has good prices for decent pizza. Nothing fancy, just traditional old school pizza. Inexpensive, greasy and delicious!!! 
This is a take out only location just FYI."}
{"text":"Had to go to 1 star.  Pizza has been awful and I don't know what happened.  So disappointed.  Sorry Rosatis but I need to find a new pizza joint."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I've been, i really enjoyed their pizza. The thin crust and the wings are delicious, the place is clean and the staff are friendly. I highly recommend this pizza place."}
{"text":"Dead roaches in the filthy dirty bathrooms. Floors in general all dirty. Poor service and mediocre food which not worth the health hazards."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever.you cant eat in the restaurant because its to hot due to they leave the side door open to the patio and its full of flys inside.I have tried to order pizza and have it delivered and it takes an hour and 45min and the pizza was cold and looked like it had been tossed in the air a few times. So i thought i would.try to order and pick up tried 3 times every time they screwed it up. First time totaly not what i orderd after waiting an extra 15 mins 2nd time i was told would be ready in 30 mins waited an extra 20 mins and found out my pizza was done sitting in the kitchen getting cold 3rd and last time will ever try this place ordered was.told.it would be 25 min when i arrived to pick up my pizza they told me it would be another 25 min i told them to keep it i will never come back . I love Rosatis pizza to bad this store sucks so bad"}
{"text":"Needed to get something quick for an office meeting.  A coworker told me about this place and she was right this place is good and the prices are great too. 
Great service, and great pizza and salads. 
Will definitely recommend this place and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town hands down. Best wings in town. Clean and very friendly staff! Almost makes me think of cheers, \"where everybody knows your name\""}
{"text":"Seriously good pizza, and my favorite: beer!"}
{"text":"We ordered a med pizza, just ok.  We ordered a thin crust !  The crust tastes dry like eating cardboard.  The staff was friendly!  Will be trying someplace else next time we feel like pizza!  Not enough of the topping. Either!"}
{"text":"The best stuffed pizza in town!

This place has a giant menu, and I've tried some of the random things on it, but really it only has to have two things:

1. Their slice special (different type of pizza every day of the week.  For example Tuesdays and Fridays are Meatza).  You get a slice of pizza and a drink for $5.

2. Their stuffed pizza.  Don't make the mistake of getting the \"Chicago Style Deep Dish\" pizza.  It's not the slice of heaven that you are looking for.   \"Stuffed\" is the name they give to their real Chicago style delight.

I think it is hands down the best in this town.  The only downside is that it is almost twice as expensive as Amano's, but if you are trying to impress someone, Amano's just won't do.

The other stuff on the menu is ok.  Some of it is interesting (their stuffed cheeseburgers are rather unique), but it's all standard fare things.

For those who have visited other Rosati's, this place is probably different than the others.  For example, the one in Bloomington, IL is a sit-down restaurant, where you tip the server.  The one in Normal, IL is a to go only shop.  This is squarely in the middle.  They have a fairly large seating area, but there's no service provided.  They give you paper cups/plates, and you get your own drinks.  If you need anything else, you have to go up to the counter and ask for it.

The TVs at this place aren't huge, but if you go during a Cubs game or Bears game, they're always tuned to that station, and the sound is turned on.  It's a pretty nice spot to watch part of a game and eat a bit of pizza.  The pictures on the walls are mostly Chicago landmarks, and really add to the feel.  I've never lived in the Chicago area, but for those who are from that area, this will definitely make you feel a bit like you are home."}
{"text":"This review is for the new sports bar section they recently installed. I love that it's near my house, and that they have cold beer, but the service is awful! Sometimes we go in there and there isn't even anyone behind the bar. When one of the girls does show up, they don't seem to know what they are doing back there. Oh, and the big bearded guy with the too small shirt, really needs to get some personality."}
{"text":"This place screwed up on the chicago monster pizza I ordered becuse our server brought out the wrong pizza and must have put in our order on the fly because the dough was not cooked and the sause was cold...... I might try it one more time but im very nervous about this place."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and i had tried to order from this place on two different occasions, on this first time they called 30 min after we ordered it and they told us they where to busy to drive and deliver our food so and the rude lady on the phone said it was ready waiting for us to pick up. So my Girlfriend and i got ready and we went to go pick our food at this point i was not angry at all i totally know how it is to be short staffed at work. Once we arrived we where not greeted for about 10 min when we talked to the girl that called us I informed her that we where here to pickup our food she walked into the back, and stayed back there for about another ten min and when she came but up front she told us our food was going to take another 30 min. so my girlfriend and i sat down and were waiting for our food there was at least 5 people working there just standing around they where not busy at all and could have totally delivered our food not to mention every other word out of there mouth was a curse word, like really we are right here we can hear everything you are saying. We finely got our food and left. On the second occasion we placed an order online. the same girl called us about 15 min after we ordered our food she told us that there fryer was going to be down for 20 to 30 min and she just wanted to let us know its going to be about an hour before we got our food i told here that it was fine we will be able to wait. About 2 hours later I called her back to see where my food was and she told me it was out for delivery. Another hour goes by and still no food. So now its been about 3 hours total she called me and told me there fryer is still down and it would be about another hour. There is no way i am waiting another hour for chicken strips and mozzarella sticks, come on really. I told her we placed the order over 3 hours ago and you told me it was out for delivery already but now your fryer is down i have no idea how that is possible. I told her i am not waiting 4 hours total for this and that she needed to refund us and   we dont even want the order anymore. When they treat there customers like this i have no idea how there are still in business. Its really sad how rude the staff is. I world never have someone like this working for me."}
{"text":"How do they do it? AMAZING pizza. I am drooling thinking about it. The best pizza I've ever had. Rosati's, please come to California! I miss you so!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of Chicago home pizza. GET the large and  you get an extra free small pizza order it with  with thin slices tomatoes. Yummy, keeps me from getting homesick."}
{"text":"I love the chicken parmigiana  here. It tastes just as good as more expensive places but 1/2 the cost. Salads are fresh and my kids love the pizza. This is a hidden gem. Service is always good."}
{"text":"First and last time ordering... Just ordered for delivery my birthday dinner to share with my family a chicken fettuccine Alfredo pasta with artichoke , a classic meat pizza and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The alfredo pAsta was plain I was lucky enough to find two pieces of chicken and no artichoke at all the aftertaste was like freezer burnt, the spaghetti was not a big deal and the pizza certainly isn't worth $20.   No utensils, no napkins no condiments at all what a bad experience... I'm staying in the Fairmont princess in the Casitas area, the delivery was kind of fast but they didn't called me before and delivered to the lobby ...because is a long walk  Took me almost 15 mins to go and get my food and 15 mins more to get back to my room."}
{"text":"So as I'm laying on the couch with the heater, several layers of sweaters, a blanket and an 80 lb Lab on me I realized that I was about 99% sure I had a fever.  Due to this I really didn't want to have to be moving around making dinner so I went to Grub Hub to find somebody who would deliver sustenance to my miserable self.  I didn't really have a particular type of cuisine in mind so I was simply looking for places that didn't have a delivery minimum as I was just ordering for myself and didn't want to be forced to order more than I wanted just to be able to get delivery.

Rosati's fit the bill and had a Calzone on the menu that looked good.  It starts as just a plain cheese Calzone but there's a large selection of toppings you can pick from and add to it.  I went with the Old Faithful of pepperoni and submitted my order.  It estimated that the delivery would take about 50 minutes so I got to work on occupying myself with the Christmas re-runs that were still on.

To my delight my calzone arrived about 10 minutes earlier than estimated, a rarity with delivery food.  Once I opened the box I found a monster of a calzone that could probably feed three grown men.  That worked out well though because I figured I'd probably be sick for a while and that meant leftovers!  As soon as I cut into the beast I knew it was going to be good just from the cheese that started oozing out of it.  The flavors lived up to this expectation.  The pepperoni was flavorful, the cheese was perfectly melted, the crust was flaky and perfectly cooked and just the right amount of sauce inside, I didn't even need the extra sauce that came with it.

The only thing that wasn't as amazing as I'd been hoping was the leftovers.  They just didn't come anywhere close to as good as the original had been but then again most food doesn't.  I can't wait to order this Calzone again and I won't even need to be sick to do so next time!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but missing an ingredient. I asked about it and the kitchen said it was under the cheese. Later found out they lied to me. Cheese sticks are cheap and frozen. Pizza was the strong point if only it was made right."}
{"text":"We are doing a Health force cleanse and decided to just have salad.We decided on the chopped salad and the harvest salad with the Apple cider vinagret. We were so surprised with fresh ingredients generous portions and wonderful flavors. We are going back again for sure. Maybe for pizza next time."}
{"text":"I was getting ready to order chicken fingers from their website because they looked really good and asked, \"Those come with fries, right?\".....because their picture shows them with fries....and she said, \"No, those cost extra.\"

I'm SO glad I asked because I would have been MAD if the food would have showed up with no fries.  I've ordered fingers from over 50 places the last 30 years and they've ALL come with fries.  To not include them with the food, especially when their picture shows them with fries, is a joke.

So, I got their Cheef sandwhich (that did come with fries).  Not bad.  Kinda skimpy on the fries.  Most places give twice as much.

Also got the turtle brownie.  Not horrible, not great.  Wouldn't spend 6 bucks on it again."}
{"text":"Rosati's gets two stars this time but it could get three or four. The potential is there and if you're going to have pizza in this strip mall, I'd choose the dark, dingy Rosati's over the more wide open, brighter Dahmen's every single time.

On our last visit, it was a Saturday around lunchtime and the place was surprisingly busy. The waitress had her hands full, but she held her own. My son and I each ordered a slice of pizza. Mine was served at room temperature. There goes one star. Make it two. The crust on their Chicago-style pizza is chewier, in an overcooked or not-very-fresh sort of way, and less flavorful than others in Chicago, and Madison for that matter. There goes another star. Make a wish. Mine is for a fresher slice of pizza. In past visits, we've had the thin crust. I think Rosati's does this much better.

My daughter had mostaccioli with sauce and butter on the side. Anyone can do that, so I'm not going to rate the entree, but I will say the marinara is fresh, thick and well-seasoned. The cheesy garlic bread is a guilty pleasure and a must-order every time, especially when dipped in that marinara. We've had the Friday fish fry. Skip it, but that's on us for ordering a fish fry at a pizza joint. 

We go to Rosati's fairly frequently and will be back. I think the solution to making this place awesome might be a just a little more attention to quality control."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers for their Groupon deal and was surprised with the quality of my calzone! I have come to expect my calzone to be airy with very little cheese/toppings until I had mine here. Plenty of cheese to go around and the pepperoni was plentiful! The size was also HUGE which allowed the fun to continue as I brought some home for dinner.

In addition to pizza/calzones, Rosati's also has a nice variety sandwiches, salads, and pastas to satisfy anyone's appetite. Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust!  The boneless wings are delicious and you can tell they're not frozen.  The dough nugget are alright, I personally think they could use more garlic butter sauce, but they give you a lot of them.  Delivery took a little bit over an hour, but they redeemed themselves with their delicious pizza.  We can't wait to go there and try their deep dish pizza.  We will definitely be repeat customers, maybe not for delivery because it takes too long, but we'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Fantastic! not much pizza around here that my husband & i REALLY like.  but rosati's is perfect:) sauce isnt to tangy or sweet, and TONS of topping w/out having to pay for extra:) and staff was great!!!!  cant wait to go back to try other menue items;)"}
{"text":"1.20.17 Been goin to Rosatis 10 plus years. Ordered 16\" thin crust. Half pepperoni,  half shrooms & olives. I specfically asked for more shrooms than olives. I received TWO shroom discs & a \"boatload\" of olives! Other half had very few pepperoni & the Italian Beef, \"sliced thin & piled high\", was not piled high, & had absolutely no taste, (bland.) $27.00 later plus tip, Im done with you Rosatis,  all you did was get progressively worse! Today is Jan 30th, and your lousy pizza is still n my fridge."}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish, WOW! One of the best pizzas I've ever had. This is now my \"go to\" pizza place."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza. Great portion size. Delivery was real quick. Not a big fan of the crust."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The deep dish pizza is awesome fresh veggies hand made and is all that you could hope for in a great pizza. The tomato and spinach cheese bread is freaking to die for also have had the fresh lasagna which was on point only reason this place does not have five stars is because of the pricing its just a little on the high side. They need to change the dollar symbol to two or three."}
{"text":"When on vacay, finding tasty pizza can be a challenge. Tried this place with a coupon. Prices are kinda high but the food was good. The wings nice but the hananero sauce wasn't hot."}
{"text":"Have only been to this location twice. Once to eat in and once as takeout. Boyfriend and I showed up later in the evening when it was raining out. Not busy at all. The waitress sat us near the bathroom when she could have sat us a bit closer, but she let us move ourselves. The staff was casual and offered up a good opinion, of which we listened to and greatly enjoyed our pizza. I only wish I could remember what we ordered. 

The second time for takeout, boyfriend and I ordered ahead of time and picked our pizza up. Again, it was raining and the wait was minimal. Pepperoni deep dish. Amazing. We loved it. No left overs. Plan on visiting again soon. =)"}
{"text":"I love Rosati's and this one didn't disappoint.  Having grown up with them in Chicago I know exactly what to expect and this one was some of the best. I've seen other reviews saying they didn't like it and I'm sure that's because pizza is subjective... people like different types. 

If you like Chicago pizza dive in and enjoy, if you're not sure, try it and see why this is some of the best!!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. The waitress was attentive. The Caesar salad was very good, and the kitchen split the salad 3 ways for the party. The pizza sauce and cheese were good, however, the crust on the thin crust pizza was ok. After living near Chicago for 8 years, I have grown to appreciate good crust found in some of the non-chain family pizza restaurants. The crust was a little thicker and harder than I like it. We did leave without any leftovers."}
{"text":"Nice people but THEE worst pizza ever. My husband a pizza lover said just throw it away. We got a deep dish and it weighed about 5 pounds. We were excited til we opened the box. It had about 4 lbs of stewed tomatoes on the top...nasty. I also paid for topping at @ $2.50 a pop. I think I got got 5 cents worth of green peppers and mushroom. 
We won't be back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The skinny young kids taking orders has forgot to put mine in the last 2 times I've ordered over the phone. It's very frustrating because the whole entire point of calling in is to not wait.. maybe give the kid a paper route or something he can handle? I do love this place though."}
{"text":"Ordered their special 16\" pizza with a two liter pop and free delivery pizza was delivered hot and delicious and before the 45 minuet time! Excellent!!"}
{"text":"always cime here when mu family craves pizza or pasta.  Wnt in last night and was very disappointed.  First of all, our waitress was not friendly at all but did tell us that the wings my husband ordered were going to take awhile.  Apparently, everyone dining in ordered wings.  When the garlic knots came out, the were overcooked and it seemed as if they rushed the wings as they were hard and burnet underneath all of the sauce they smothered on.

This experience has led us to the decision that we will not come here anymore.  It was terrible."}
{"text":"Actually found this one on Yelp! I was looking for something new to try as the family was getting a little burnt out on NYPD and Barro's Pizza! We try to stay away from the mega-pizza chains so Rosati's it was! 

First off- the online order process was stellar. I had an account setup in less than 2 minutes, with a 10% coupon to boot! The site is extremely user friendly, simple navigation. You can include a tip during the purchase step, set out the time to be delivered (ASAP, specific time, etc.) and then you get the graphic that shows you live status of your order (prepping, baking, delivering) - makes the entire process easy and informative.

Now on to the pizza. We ordered the thin crust cut into squares. Just a plain pie (no toppings)- and it was delicious. It delivered hot (not warm), with hot breadsticks and half-order buffalo wings. The apps were tasty as well. The pizza sauce is really pretty good, a little sweet. Pizza dough was fresh and cooked perfectly. This is oven baked pizza- Chicago style. I noticed they have double crust as well- pan style- sill have to try that next order. 

The price was just right- and we had plenty of food for the family. We will now add this place to the \"rotation\" of our regular delivery spots when we crave pizza. I don't understand the mediocre reviews- I was happy."}
{"text":"Rosati's has really good thin crust pizza and Italian Beef. It's close to home, so I take out from there quite often. I'm from the Chicago area and good pizza in PHX is hard to find. Rosati's exceeds my expectations."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but it really sorta lacked the care that I would expect from a \"Chicago style joint\". my thin crust was burnt, the deep dish was undercooked, not good."}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood and was craving Italian food. This place was just a couple blocks away. I ordered the food and paid through YELP.

I ordered meat ravioli, 2 meatballs, and a side salad.
The food was excellent. I received a text message that it was ready, walked in and walked out. That was easy.
I did have time to look at their extensive overhead menu board. Next time I want to try the baked lasagna, if I don't try my favorite: thin crust pizza.

This restaurant is not what I'd call dine in unless your happy on a counter stool at a window counter."}
{"text":"DON'T TRY TO USE YOUR RESTAURANT.COM COUPON HERE. We had gone to a movie with friends and wanted pizza after. We had bought a certificate on restaurant.com to use here. We drove all the way over to find out they do not honor their coupon as stated on the certificate [\"save $25 on purchase\"]. There is no disclaimer or language, even in the small print, that says it must only be used on food. However, they would not allow drinks to be included. We discussed it with them, saying we knew we could not buy $50 worth of food alone here and were going to have cocktails. They were adamant that we could only use it on food purchase, so we left. Maybe they think they are getting free advertising by having their restaurant on the site so people will check them out and stay anyway, but we did not because of the principle. (Some certificates say \"food only\" and I suggested they needed to change their certificate so it is not misleading, but they only argued.) The place was totally empty, but I guess they did not want our business, and now have lost it in the future as well, because of their false advertising."}
{"text":"Always excellent...can't go wrong with Chicago style or thin crust...love it! 

I'm from Chicago originally and love having a Rosati's so close!!"}
{"text":"when they forgot my fried mushroom and ranch order last time. Gave me choice to bring out that evening or bring next time I ordered. Tonight I ordered and Manager said won't bring mushrooms- it's been too long and they can't track it???
Guess there is a reason for their poor ratings
Wish I could give 0 star"}
{"text":"No problem with the food here, just the service. I have ordered food from here 3 times, once takeout and twice delivery. Everytime I have put an order in here they get something on the order wrong. When I try to make a complaint about it the staff is very rude and not apologetic at all. This location has very young girls taking the orders and it is my feeling that they don't pay attention very well since they get the order wrong every time. I will never order from this location again because of the terrible service and uncaring staff."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had the crust is like card board I order BBQ chicken it came with just chicken no onions or cilantro. Terrible, do not waste your money buy a frozen one at the store it is better,"}
{"text":"Ordered lasagna that came with garlic bread and the Monster Pizza. Lasagna was very disappointing...average be cause the sauce didn't have much flavor and the  garlic bread was below-average no taste to it. Rating this 1.5/5.  The monster pizza with jalapenos was excellent."}
{"text":"Always fresh, hot and on time! My husband won't let me order from anywhere else now that we have a Rosati's near by! We order atleast 1-2 times per month and it's always amazing!"}
{"text":"This has become a regular take out place for us.  The Chicago style pizza is the best and the hot sandwiches are a great option too.

Great neighborhood atmosphere, kid friendly place."}
{"text":"If I could select ZERO stars I would! This is the worst service ever! For the 4th time in a row - and it's really my own fault for going back there - my $40+ order was wrong! When I called to let them know, they said I could bring back the wrong food and wait for the right food to be prepared! If this was the first time, I might have done that - which is what I did the first time...but this is not the first time! I was told that they couldn't deliver the right food because their delivery people are independent contractors and it costs them per delivery - well, it just cost them a customer - and hopefully others who read this will NEVER order from this restaurant either! Then, the few bucks it would have cost them to pay their independent contractor delivery person  will seem like nothing compared to the amount of business profit they have lost. DONE WITH ROSATI'S ON WIGWAM AND PECOS FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It amazes that of all the places in Chicago, Rosati's has locations in the valley. I remember it as the good, but not really that great Chicago pizza place. 

On the plus side; they do offer decent deep dish and stuffed pizza. And best of all, they have the one thing I always loved about Rosati's... Italian beef as a topping! 
However; Rosati's is extremely pricey for any kind of pizza. Plus it's pretty skimpy on the sauce and toppings. The thin crust is a lot better than the deep dish, and I'm more of a deep dish guy. 

Rosati's does deliver (requiring a minimum of a $15 purchase, and a $3 delivery fee), which makes it convenient. Rosati's also has a huge menu filled with pastas, sandwiches, salads, and other foods, but that's not something I'm interested in trying from there. 

It's a good place if you want to switch things up, but it's not a place I would ever have a sudden craving for."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! I was so thrilled that they finally came down from Chicago."}
{"text":"Awesome amazing fresh delicious pizza. The wings are absolutely the best partner to the the pizza. Both deep dish and thin crust pizza fire. Always my favorite pizza in Vegas. Bomb EVERY TIME!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza takeout.  The wings are nicely sized and always loaded with sauce.  The pizza is always tasty with a crispy crust.  Giant pizza and loads of wings at a great price."}
{"text":"We went to Rosati today for a,quick early dinner. Nice new paint..cashier was fast friendly and efficient..bbq chicken wrap was perfect and delicious..I had the cheef  Italian beef w cheese and aus  jus.it was hot and perfectly spiced a real taste bud treat! Manager came out and was pleasant .Restrooms were clean
.all the way it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Rosati's was extremely delicious. My boyfriend and I had a Chicago deep dish pizza which was amazing. The staff there is super friendly which is always a plus. I will definitely be back to try more menu options!"}
{"text":"I had heard that this location reopened, so I was eager to give them a try and find out if the food was as good as it was before. I was not disappointed! Their calzones are To Die for, Chicken Parmesan - Excellent, Italian Beef Sandwich - Melt in your Mouth Tender. I really love their crust, thick or thin. It's crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and they don't scrimp on the cheese. They give a discount if you order online and delivery is surprisingly fast! I have missed you guys; welcome back Rosati's!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the lady that takes your order! She makes you feel welcomed and like family within seconds. Never a rush to order or get through your meal if you're dining in. Take out and delivery times are within minutes of the word time which is amazing. And the food is just delicious!"}
{"text":"Veggie pizza was quite terrible. Dough was the worst I've had. Delivery took almost 2 hours. Didn't have ranch or garlic sauce like I asked for."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have had. We order for our shop pretty frequently. Staff is friendly fast service without losing the quality. Want a great pizza try this place. Thanks guys for taking care of us."}
{"text":"We've heard this spot is pretty well known for its Pizza, so naturally we dine in for two plates of pasta and mozzarella sticks. Because logic, right?

I'm kind of in the no regrets standing though. The pastas were both pretty damn good (with the exception that they were, in fairness, a little stingy on the meatball side of the \"spaghetti and meatballs\" plate). Fortunately that was not my plate so I wasn't the victim of the evening. The chicken on the chicken parm seemed fair enough. Neither of us finished our plates or the appetizer for that matter. We are trying to be less american (gluttonous). 

I will say as a side note the server was okay. He was definitely a nice guy, but not very personable. I'm figuring it was because he was running around as a one man show, but I'm just personally a sucker for those servers who make you feel \"at home.\" We didn't. It felt like a restaurant. So... eh?

All in all, id say to you... go. It's good. I'd say to them... throw another meatball or two on the order that has meatball in the title. We as guests like that stuff."}
{"text":"Wow!! I highly recommend!!!  Service is awesome!  Pizza is yummy!! Menu is diverse!! And what an atmosphere!!  Great restaurant/sports bar for family & friends!  And yes, they deliver to DC Ranch, Grayhawk, Sonoran Hills, ect... And they are open late!!  I wish Rosati's in North Scottsdale lots of success & good fortune!! Welcome to the neighborhood!!!  FYI...they have fabulous fries!!!"}
{"text":"Only my second time ordering from this location, and whoever answered the phone here at 8:40 pm tonight, is the RUDEST person to EVER exist.  I hung up on him and will obviously not be giving them business.  Too bad because their pizza is very good.  I tried to complain on their website and it won't even let you email them."}
{"text":"Rosati's has the best gluten free pizza we have ever had. I have had just about every type of gluten free pizza in the last 10 years  and there is nothing comes close to Rosati's. We love our neighborhood location, they are always way ahead of the scheduled time for delivery and the staff is top notch. Our kids love the deep dish and stuffed crust."}
{"text":"This place has officially gone down hill. I have been a customer for just over four years. I loved their lunch specials, however they changed the best ones and marked up the prices. I loved their chicken fingers, then they changed them to the mostly batter ones that are just edible.  Now they changed their ranch dressing which was awesome. It was homemade, now it comes in a package which taste like Hidden Valley. The only thing worth coming for is the wings and now there a dollar each. Even Tuesday chicken wing day went from .50 cents a wing to .70 cents."}
{"text":"Double dough classic combo. Really good pizza. The crust could have been better. I would go again tho."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else, the food is really very good. I had eggplant parm and my husband had a calzone. Walking in we were seated at a dirty table, we asked one of the waitresses to clean it off and since she saw we got sprayed with cleaner she let us know it was a mild disinfectant. From there it took 15 minutes to get drinks, my salad never arrived and it took 45 minutes for food and an additional 10 minutes to eat (we were never given silverware). Once we had them remove the invisible salad off the bill, we let them know how horrible the service was. 

Definetly get take out, the food is worth it but the service is not!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I like eating at places nearby but the service is cringe worthy. We came into a empty restaurant so it was nice to have our choice of seats. We chose a seat at the back of the restaurant by the big flat screens. The TV's were entertaining because we were waiting for a deep dish to be made which takes like 40 min.  They had a nice Christmas comedy on so we didn't mind waiting even though we had to refill our own drinks most of the time. Then things start to go downhill from there. The waitress sat a large group right next to us ...out of all of the empty seats in the restaurant she chooses that one! Then they ask the waitress if they can change the channel she changes the TV  we are watching without even asking us...very rude! There was another TV that she could of changed without compromising anyone's entertainment. 

I was happy to see that the food was ready but shortly after biting into in the deep dish I realized that the toppings were wrong. They added mushrooms which I never order because my husband can't stand them . Since the pizza took so long I just accepted the mistake. The sauce which is put on top of the pie was a bit too sour for my taste. The cheesy bread was okay but the meal wasn't worth what we paid for. 

I know that there are many pizza places in the area that taste better and cost less. I wish I traveled a little farther and went to Amore's!"}
{"text":"NO - S.J. from Tempe I am by far the pickest person you'll ever meet - normally my reviews are far from good ones unless deserved.  Now in this case I AM from the Chicago suburbs and definitely know a good pizza when I eat one !! Also, have eaten at numerous Rosati's here and in IL and this particular location by far is the BEST !!!

We (our whole family) live in Gilbert - not exactly next door, and there are numerous pizza places (or so called ones) and we drive to this particular one for the FOOD and the FRIENDLY WAIT STAFF... NO we don't know the owner nor are we related just an average customer who happens to like so far anything we've gotten at this particular location.  We have NEVER found them to be padding the bill or any inuendo's of the sort.  The quality of the food is always the finest of ingredients on and on.

If there is 1 negative I will say spiff up your restrooms and definitely get new booths they all are like sitting in a hole.

So anyone wanting the BEST PIZZA in the EAST VALLEY please give this Rosati location a try !!!!"}
{"text":"Take-out only.  I've never tried the option, but if you place your order online, you can get 20% off your bill.  Mom's tried and liked the meatballs here (they're OK), and the fettucine alfredos I'd ordered were good  when I craved for the dish a couple of times- I needed something quick and didn't have a way to check out other options.  It's a Chicago-chain which I never cared for while I lived in the Chicago-area, so I rarely order from here now..."}
{"text":"Pizza is not to good and the dude behind the counter kept apoologizing saying he was only one working today. The area is desperate for a good restaurant or pizza place this is just not the place. I would definitely say it's my first and last time at the place."}
{"text":"You will thank me for this little tidbit...There is a 50% off gift card offer for this location at:

http://www.citydeals.com/location/index/index/id/2910?ref=CDUMTIwNzgw

A nice place to dine in for pizza and fairly tasty pasta dishes. Nice staff at this location. Nice flat screen television for those that just can't break away from the game long enough to feed themselves.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We've picked up a pie from Rosati's two times now - both sausage and both quite delicious.
The sausage is ground, but has a lot of flavor.
The pie is sliced into little squares - which my husband, from Chicago, LOVES.

The do deliver, but we like to go for a little ride and pick it up. The place is in an odd kind of out-of-the way strip mall off of 116th. There are a couple of tables there, nothing fancy, it's clean (one thing you kind of worry about with delivery only places).

The gal at the front counter both times has been very nice. 

Highly suggest you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"They advertised check-in deal through Yelp and then don't honor it.  Very strange that they would not even take a minute to check there own yelp page and verify the deal is being offered.  On the bright side, the phone employee was very nice in explaining the manager isn't honoring that yelp offer.  I'm not giving this review in response to the food, only the customer service since I didn't even get a chance to order.
In an area very strong in pizza competition I'll try somewhere else this time."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of their other offerings, but if you've got some extra change to upgrade from chain pizza, this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice both times with mediocre results. The pizza is at best below average. The pizza was dry with poor quality ingredients. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here a couple of times and every time they have been extremely late with no effort to fix anything and they forgot a side both times. Would not recommend delivery."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza place that delivers to our home AND has good pizza, wings, & (drum roll please) RANCH....yippee.  We ordered Rosati's service over the phone was the best, the woman on the phone was so helpful and even asked me how many we are feeding to make sure we didn't over order.  We found out about this place from a mailer that came with some coupons but she said we could opt for the free delivery which was a bigger savings.  But lets get to the pizza....thin crust, square pizza with FRESH inexpedience, wow was this great.  The chicken wings were great also and of course the ranch hit the spot.  The delivery guy was great and more importantly, on time!  Yep I am a fan."}
{"text":"I called Rosati's a little while back, and I was not impressed with the food, but I had such an excellent experience with the girl who picked up the phone that I was just incredibly compelled to write a review. She was so exceptionally kind and articulate that I asked her name so I could leave a good word for her. Gabby, the hostess, was very sweet, attentive, and helpful. Whoever her mother is should be proud of raising such a well-spoken woman. In fact, I wish I were her mother so I could have the privilege of saying that I raised a beautiful, gentle-natured, and diligent woman. I even asked her age, and was flabbergasted to find that a high schooler is so hardworking. If I were her boss, I'd promote her to manager, and if I owned yelp, I'd allow the option for ten stars, just for Gabby."}
{"text":"I'm almost embarrassed on what just went down, we actually went to the one on the North Side on Losee rd but I couldn't find it on FB ... I would post pics but I'm laying face first on my bed because of the longest day of my life and my son made my plate, it was not picture worthy the way he slopped it on but it certainly didn't effect the taste..

They seem to have new owners quite often but this time it was an advantage..Here is the embarrassing part, we ordered all this for 3 people and one of them happens to be my 97 year old mama.. I'm so disgusted with myself right now..

Tuesdays are 75 cent wing night, ok let's get some wings right, but.........

We ordered:
20 mild wings
10 Teriyaki wings
10 Garlic and Parm wings ( so bomb, I made orgasm noises) 
1 extra large Monster (18 inches of goodness)
It came with Gourmet Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, onion, green pepper, Canadian bacon, meatball, black & green olives with tomato and bacon on top

Oh and let's not forget the best lasagna in town, it had so much cheese, I was worried there wasn't any left for their other customers...damn good thing I'm not lactose intolerant, it comes with a bread stick which might of been made yesterday but who cares, look at all the damn food we have...

They were on time when they said it would be done, my son didn't have to wait at all, everything was hot and amazing except that bread stick that you could knock someone out with... So this all came to $90.00, yes we went for 75 cent wings!!......It was well worth it and there is so much food left over we will be having it for breakfast, lunch and dinner tomorrow...the diva mama doesn't like leftovers, if she says one thing like what is this leftovers?.............I'll be handing her a can of tuna

I give this all 5 STARS...I give myself 1 STAR for not marrying a rich man to pay for all this

{"text":"My Fiance and I were first introduced to Rosati's Pizza from his parents. Every time his parents ordered they got supreme, which I don't like however I picked off the toppings and it was still great. Tonight, we order our own (NO SUPREME) thin crust pepperoni and mushroom and it was Awesome! Great Price too- $12.99. We are going to order Rosati's for my Birthday dinner and have everyone over!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in the Valley. Highly recommend the thin crust. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is due to the limited beer selection on tap. Would like to see more microbrews and seasonals."}
{"text":"I really wish just one time our order would come hot and correct.  This is the third or fourth time we have ordered and EVERY SINGLE TIME it is not hot and something isn't right.  I get you might be busy ....but every time.  Tonight's order took 1.5 hours yo getg here.  She had her kid in the car and of course they messed up the order."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would.
On 12/14 we called and placed an order at 6:15. At 7:30 we called to ask where are pizza was, and was told the driver had left \"20 minutes ago\" and we should see him in \"5-10 minutes\"
At 8PM we called again and asked for a refund so we could go get different food for our 3 kids who were by now starving and cranky from being up past bedtime. We were offered 25% off our next order. We explained we didn't want the food now, we had been waiting for 2 hours, and we didn't want to return. Either they could comp our meal now and we might consider buying from them again, or we could refuse the food and get a refund. We were hung up on. We went to the place in person and there were 3 employees hanging around (so why was no one out doing deliveries for 2 hours???) and they were extremely rude to us and said a refund would take 72 hours. We said fine and left. As soon as we got home the delivery guy showed up (2 hours and 20 minutes after we placed our order). The food was cold. We refused it.

It is now 12/19 and no refund. We will be calling the BBB and our bank to file fraud charges tomorrow if no refund has been issued.

TL;DR it took almost TWO AND A HALF HOURS to deliver our food, it was cold, the staff was rude, and they still have not refunded us almost a week later. Do not give this place your money."}
{"text":"I've only tried the thin crust pizza here and I love it. It's totally different from a NY style pizza, but delicious nonetheless.  It's cut into squares, not greasy, perfect amount of cheese, crispy, and everything tastes really fresh. The only thing is that it's really too expensive and not worth the prices they charge. I would probably not eat here as often due to the price."}
{"text":"I have had problems with Rosati's in the past: Really slow, forgetting the dessert part of the order, waiting 39 minutes past when they said it would be ready, and then it was the wrong pizza. So after avoiding them for probably a year and a half I thought I would try again. Once again I waited an hour and a half for them to get my order wrong!  I will NEVER order from Rosati's again. My question is: Does somebody actually run this place? Who's the manager? I have never spoke to someone in charge. The staff always attempts to be helpful, but there has never been a decision maker on site to help out any time I have had a problem. How ever owns this joint needs to take a serious look at who is minding there store because they could certainly do a lot better."}
{"text":"The deep-dish pizza is fantastic, but we've had several problems ordering from them.

The first time we ordered, we ordered online and requested delivery.  We ordered early in the afternoon for delivery at 6pm.  It was a little after 6:30pm that the pizza arrived, which was fine but surprising since they'd had all day to get it ready.  They had forgotten to include the garlic bread that we'd ordered.  Still, the pizza was exactly what we were looking for: crispy deep dish crust, doughy middle with tons of cheese, sausage, peppers, onions, etc.  Delicious!

We just ordered again last night, and this time we called.  They recognized our phone number, and we told them we wanted to order the same pizza as last time.  We also asked that they throw in a garlic bread because we didn't get one last time.  They said no problem.  A half-hour later, they called back and said that they weren't able to deliver because we were too far away.  Puzzled, we asked them how come we got delivery before, and they merely said that it was the driver's discretion and he must have not had a busy night last time.

So I jumped in the car and drove up to get it.  It took my 8 minutes to get there, which doesn't seem like an excessive trip for delivery.  But mostly I wish they would just be consistent; I don't mind picking it up if I know that's required ahead of time.  When I got the pizza home, I was very disappointed to find out that they'd messed up the order.  The pizza was not as good as before because it only had cheese and sausage and was missing all the other ingredients we ordered.  With a deep dish pizza, you have to have lots of toppings!

We love the pizza, but if we order from them again, we'll have to be very careful about making sure they get the order right."}
{"text":"Shame on Rosati's. For twenty years I have ordered hundreds if not thousands of pizzas from the various locations around the valley. Tonight we waited one hour and twenty five minutes for the apparent manager to deliver an ice cold pizza and matching Italian beef sandwich. I called to report the poor service only to be told they would trade for a hot order in another hour or so. I told the young lady that was unacceptable.  She said she'd check with the manager and call me back. She offered a forty percent discount. Terrible offer.   We reheated the pizza, which of course is not the same as a fresh pie, only to bite into an ingredient we didn't order. And reheating an Italian beef sandwich doesn't work.  I promised this review. Shame on you Rosati's. You've lost my business forever."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is perfectly cooked and crisp. Delivery was prompt and the pizza was piping hot as if it just came out of the oven, impressive!"}
{"text":"This was the most expensively terrible pizza we've ever had. The sauce drowned out the cheese because most of it was on TOP of the toppings. It looked like someone threw up sauce over everything.

And speaking of the sauce, three words: SALTY, SALTY, SALTY. Like seriously. Even the crust was incredibly salty. Couldn't even finish a single slice, it was so disgusting.

We have never been picky about pizza, but wow were we disappointed in the quality of this food."}
{"text":"Foods alright, not impressed by there pizza but not much else for a quick bite on this corner except the market next door.  Honestly there roller pizzas might be better at this time of the day.  The man that served my order was pretty rude also.  I kind of felt he was like hurry up and get out of here!  But it's a beautiful day and I'm enjoying the outside tables!  Probably why I gave this experience 2 stars instead of 1!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Rosati's West since I moved to Madison. However, since they raised their prices, I don't feel like their meals are competitive anymore -- there's a lot of good other pizza joints around here. Also, their \"customer service\" is kinda crappy. Obviously, small mistakes happen - and they have multiple times before - (e.g. being charged for mayos that should have been included) but I never thought of writing a review up until tonight. 

So, amongst other things, I ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds. Both came plain, with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Cheese curds also came with no sauce. I was not asked what I wanted with curds/ on sandwiches during the order and I definitely did not say that I wanted them plain, as witnessed by two other people in the room while I placed the order. When I called back, the kid told me that I ordered plain & cheese curds with no sauce. You know, if I don't explicitly say that you want lettuce, tomato and mayo, but your menu says that it comes with it, you just put in on it, period. Kid said (with an attitude) that he will put in a note for the next time... there will be no next time! It's not like I wanted my money back... all they needed to say was sorry, it's not going to happen again."}
{"text":"Great food and great location! Not a long wait at all for your food. Kerri was super friendly and helpful ! I will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"I was on this side of town and decided I stop by Rosati!!! Why? Because the very few place I can get Chicago pizza to go! Place my order and no hassle. Once the pizza came it was like any other Rosati fresh and good for a Arizona Chicago pizza!! Staff was very friendly and manager even gave me a free large drink for being a first time here! Thanks I'll give you the 5 stars!!! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"You gotta get the dough nuggets! These are SO GOOD, and you get a huge mound of them buried in parmesan! 

We love dining in at Rosati's because it's a such a nice atmosphere. There's something about a place that is nice and dim that makes a restaurant so much more relaxing. 

The pizza has always been delicious, especially the deep dish!

The only thing I haven't liked is the Italian Beef. It isn't seasoned properly, and doesn't taste at all like an Italian Beef sandwich that you would get anywhere in Chicago that made Italian Beef sandwiches so popular."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. I have lived here for over six years and been getting pizza from this location for over six years. I've had three incidents where things did not go well. The first time was I asked for green peppers on my pizza and the girl asked me what kind of peppers so I said sweet because when you're from Chicago green peppers sweet peppers. I got a pizza that had sugary Green peppers on it. So I called and they gave me a credit. The second time I ordered a stuffed cheese pizza and it was about the same size as a regular I took pictures offered to bring them in but they gave me a credit. This happened in the span of about five years so considering how much I order that wasn't too much of a big deal. On Valentine's Day I ordered And the pizza was undercooked ,very much so. It was not the pizza I have come to know. I called and spoke with a manager I cannot remember his name I believe it was a Hispanic name. When I told him it was under cooked his words were \" uh, I think I was the one that made that and I think it was done enough\" I told him that I have been getting pizza from this establishment for six years and it was not done and it was not what I have come to expect from there. He told me I would get a $15 credit. Mind you even after he told me he thought it was done enough I told him I understand that it could be under cooked as I'm sure they are overwhelmed since it's Valentine's Day I was making excuses for him. Today I went to use the credit and he told me he will not honor it as he has no record of it. This is what another young man told me. I told him the manager is the one they gave me the credit on Valentine's Day and he just said sorry he said no, not until A cashier can come in to verify it. I will not come back to that Rosatis. You just lost a six-year customer. A customer who spent $30 or more every single time. You can thank your night manager for that."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and the service is getting horrible. The last two times I've been here my order was given to someone else and I have to wait for it to be remade. While waiting for my food to be remade this time I watched 3 people wait for their food which was sitting in the heat box. One guy walked up, asked is that my order, they said no, then 2 minutes later they called up and gave him the same food he'd asked about! 

It's to the point I won't be back. How many times must I wait for my food because they gave it to someone else!?"}
{"text":"This Rosati's customer service is horrible.  My pizza took 50 minutes to get to me and the two young teenage girls working the front counter could have really cared less than I was waiting for so long.  When I told them I was unhappy with the service they blamed it on their system and didn't even appologize.  I then called to talk to the manager and he/she wouldn't even take my call. 

Thumbs down!!"}
{"text":"Food was overprice! Terrible Pizza! I am from Chicago, and was very disappointed in the service, and the food. I will never return to this place in Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"So I called to order a pizza,  chicken and mushroom, light sauce since they didn't have a pesto sauce (which I thought they did) and when the lady said $19.90 at the end of the call, I almost called back to cancel.  
When I got there, I said, \"how come I can order a large pizza from Pizza hut with all the toppings I want and yours is DOUBLE the price?\"  
First she looked at me funny, like DUH, and then I pressed her more. Seriously explain it to me, help me understand. She babbled on about homemade, fresh, not frozen dough,  family business, blah blah.  She said she had worked at pizza hut and she guaranteed this was way better.  With the explanation she gave, I could understand $4-5 more, but not DOUBLE.  I said we'll see if its twice as good.  

So I got home,  took the first bite,  ok, not bad, I could tell the cheese was different,  good.  Then I took a bite with chicken.  I had to put the slice down and pull a piece of chicken off to inspect it to see if it was really chicken because it was crunchy!  I pulled another piece off to see if it was deep fried chicken,  no.  It was just half inch chunks of chicken sooooo overcooked and dry that they were almost impossible to chew.  My pizza hut chicken is cut strips of chicken breast moist and meaty.  The mushrooms on Rosatis were smaller and more black shading, like not as white and fresh as pizza hut. And the crust was THIN and burnt around the edges,  not soft and fluffy like pizza hut. 
So if you like, thin, dry, overcooked, overrated, overpriced,  pizza with decent cheese buy Rosatis, if you want classic, gooey, soft, moist pizza for half the price, stick with pizza hut.  

To be fair, everything else we've ever ordered from Rosatis is good, like pasta, ribs, shrimp, etc.   But they may want to rethink their pizza quality to justify twice the price."}
{"text":"Only a Sith deals in absolutes... but this was ABSOLUTELY the best Chicken Parmesan I've ever had in a restaurant. I don't know how else to start this review other than to say that. There's no time for eloquent prose when chicken parm is on the line. I mean, man... it was amazing. And don't stop just because I said the chicky chicky parm parm (Tom Haverfood) was the best. I've tried a lot of different things here and they've all been winners. Let me go down the line.

- The pizzas: I've had the White, Hawaiian, and one with bacon. All awesome. I love thin crust pizza, but I dislike soggy thin crust. Not a problem here. The crust was great, the sauce was good, and the toppings taste like they do when you buy them fresh at Whole Foods. You don't realize how bland chain pizzas really are until you compare them to pizza like this. I honestly am opposed to pizzas costing more than a tenner, but after you eat one of these you'll be A-OK with it. The Hawaiian (the best of the three I've had) was absolutely worth every penny. 

- Cheese ravioli: I'm not the world's greatest fan of ravioli, TBH. But this ravioli was great. They're bigger, so they're not like the Chef Boyardi stuff I usually have at home, but that just makes them better. My dad liked the ravioli tons. I really liked the cheese, and I would not be opposed to that cheese blend on a pizza...

- Baked Lasagna: I know, I know.... lasagna is usually hit-or-miss at these places, right? Maybe if you go to a not-so-awesome place. The lasagna here was awesome. I really liked that it was more composed than lasagnas usually look, and I loved that cheese was not skimped on. Also not opposed to throwing some lasagna bits on a pizza...

- Breadsticks: I don't want to ruin this for you. Get them. 

- Wings: You like wings, right? Sure you do. The wings here were good! My favorite was that they were extra saucy, which is great. I love having extra wing sauce because I can dip my breadsticks all up in there and slop it up. I thought the wings were good, but they were blown away by...

- THE CHICKEN PARM: I love chicken parm. It's one of my favorite foods on Earth, and probably what I would pick as my last meal. I don't know the sorcery involved in making delicious chicken parm, as I've only made good parm twice out of about 2042 attempts. But basically you need the noodles to be on point, the sauce needs to bring it together, and the chicken has to be the star (IMO). This place takes that and says \"noodles on point, sauce is great, CHICKEN IS THE BEST.\" I got two pieces of chicken, perfectly breaded and baked and sitting atop my noodles. It was the best. Again, best chicken parm I've ever had from a restaurant. I can't imagine going to Rosati's and not ordering the chicken parm. Like I know I'll probably go in there for a pizza but I'll get a chicken parm for later. It's that good.  

- Service: Everyone was super nice, polite, and answered my questions about stuffs. There's a younger girl who works there who was extra polite and nice, and it made me happy to experience that kind of a service in a more casual setting.

All in all, I think the food was great. I think the chicken parm and pizzas have spoiled me so I can't go elsewhere until my taste buds forget about it all. Not only that, but my family loved all the food. It's usually pretty hard for me to find a place when it's my turn to host family dinners, but I've found it with Rosati's. The breadth of options is great, the service was wonderful, but more importantly: it was all delicious and you can tell the stuff is made when you order it. Go to Rosati's, try the pizza and/or/and chicken parm and I guarantee you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a Italian food snob. But then again I did live in NYC for over 22 years. I know that I'll never find food as amazing as I did back home, but I was hoping for good things from Rosati's after friends of mine Oohed and Ahhed about them. Sadly I found their food mediocre at best. The lasagna was too garlicky and loaded with too many spices; as if they know their food is lacking in some areas. Their garlic bread sticks were a little hard and stale. Their staff was friendly and courteous and their prices aren't too outrageous. Sadly I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Zero stars!!! I never had an experience this bad with Rosati's. I ordered over the phone to pick up in store as i was going to use the 12 cardboard coupons. First off, the rep didnt understand wut those were and kept telling me I could only use one. I'm like huh!?? You need 12 to get the 50% discount. Anyways, wen I showed up to pick it up, the rep said it was on its way to be delivered. I said WUUUUT??? No. I specifically said PICK UP. She called the driver and the driver wanted to \"leave it\" at my doorstep. So they did and I still paid for it. 

The problem here?? They screwed up bigtime!!
Never apologized or offered me a special deal for future use. 2nd, really??? Leave the pizza at my doorstep because he has other deliveries?? Wen I asked for 2 ranch dips, she straight up said she can only give me one and has to charge me for the other...psshh WOW!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza. Great selection on their menu with a ton of diversity ranging from wings to pasta to salads and pizza. 

Their best pizza is their thin crust. If you want deep dish go with Papa Dels. Boneless wings are quite tasty. They're high quality chicken and you get a lot for your $. 

Delivery is prompt (even tho they will say it takes 1 hour) usually around 30 minutes. Nice place to eat-in at and good for groups. Try this out if you are looking for a solid food spot with tasty grub!"}
{"text":"I had their Cheef sandwich and an order of garlic cheese bread. 

The Cheef is an Italian Beef sandwich covered in mozzarella cheese! That sounded awesome on the menu and it tasted pretty darn good. It didn't have the best Italian Beef taste for my liking...but keep in mind I am a stuck-up pompous butt-head when it comes to Italian Beefness. The taste was great, don't get me wrong...I think anyone would agree. Also, the meat was stacked higher than Sears Tower...I mean there was A LOT of meat on this bad boy...tender, too. They had the peppers and stuff as is standard, plus the mozzarella. The cheese gave it a sweetness that surprised me. It compliments the flavor of the meat so well that I excused the downfall of the sandwich - the gravy. Two things make or break an Italian Beef for me: the meat and the gravy. The gravy they use is decent, just not top-rate...if they put a little more love in their seasoning of the meat, then this would be the ultimate IB. But still darned good, man. 

The garlic cheese bread was better than I expected. Thick and crusty and baked perfectly with gooey cheese and plenty of butter and garlic. Tasted good dipped in the au jour as well, heh heh. 

I had this delivered and it all came up to about 12 bucks. Pretty standard. I ordered, then called back cause I forgot to use a coupon and they applied it with no questions asked. Came quickly enough, around your standard 40 minute mark. 

Their menu has plenty of pasta options to make me try them again, as well as their pizza that I really would like to try...especially since its supposed to be a pizza 'pie' type deal or 'Chicago style'. And...is that sum Ribz I's sees on dat menu??? 
Good local food where I can get a decent Italian Beef anytime I want it."}
{"text":"ok this is it Im a fan i keep ordering and thats that These guy are good!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location and we were not disappointed! We ended up ordering one 12\" pan pizza with just cheese and pepperoni, one 12\" Chicago style deep dish with pepperoni, cheese and garlic, two calzones with pepperoni and Italian beef and a chicken parmesan sandwich. 

  The delivery was fast and as always the food was delicious, I love their rich buttery deep dish crust. I tried their calzone for the first time too and it was great too, the crust was awesome and flaky. The only reason I give them four stars instead of 5 is because of the price, they are pretty steep, so I don't know if my office would order lunch with them again. With everything we ordered with taxes, delivery fee and tip it cost was over $75.00. But with that said, none of us left hungry!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location for delivery. We ordered a large Chicago style deep dish with a side cesear salad. It took under an hour to get to us , which was fine, but the pizza crust was under cooked. After calling the store again and explaining the situation they set out another pizza and it was perfect. The replacement pizza only took about thirty minutes and the staff seemed genuinely concerned to make everything right. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"This Rosatis rocks, as most of them do.

Great food, quality ingredients, generous portions.

They really put attention to detail into everything.  Really authentic tasting pasta dishes and great pizza."}
{"text":"i always order delivery from here 
best Chicago style pizza in town i always order the meat mania pizza and cant stop eating it..lol
the sauce is just perfect  and the lasagna is to die for     huge and tastes amazing
highly recommend"}
{"text":"Today's service was not up-to par.  Called in my order from work purposely, so all I had to do was pay and take it home.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  Seem like the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing.    First I was told , would only be another 3 min.  Then told , the food was not made,and the wait would be 15-20 min.   Felt it was very disorganized.    Normally, always had great service.  Today, was not that!!"}
{"text":"Cheesy yummyness!!! Fantastic Chicago pizza!! The delivery was 10 minutes faster and ordering online was so easy. We we're thrilled we had ordered. I would have posted pictures but we ate it too fast!"}
{"text":"Just had a Rosati's Monster double dough! One of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. Good place to eat and watch some football!"}
{"text":"Terrific thin crust pizza. Try the breaded mushrooms- delicious!!!  Mozzarella sticks are not to miss. Homemade ranch dressing is a perfect compliment."}
{"text":"Amazing service. The food was to die for and the staff was so kind and friendly . This has become our weekend spot"}
{"text":"Meh that one word sums up the food here. I frequently go to the location on Durango and the pizza is always crispy and hot, With the cheese just perfectly melted and the crust has that perfect crunch everytime you bite into it. Until recently it was the most authentic Chicago style pizza I could find in Vegas. Anyways........ I saw the location in Sunnerlin and decided to pay a visit. I was craving some pizza that day and my son is always ready for pizza. We ordered the usual, thin crust pepperoni, I also ordered a side salad. My salad arrived before the pizza and pieces of it were frozen? Supposedly it's supposed to be fresh but that's not the case here. They're storing the salads in the freezer. After what seemed like a long wait considering we were the only people in there at the time our pizza arrived. It was cold and doughy. Needless to say we won't he returning. If yours looking for the cracker thin Chicago pizza try Pizza Rock downtown."}
{"text":"I was starving and didn't want to leave the house so I ordered a pizza and wings. 40 dollars later the wings were soggy from the styrofoam container and the pizza was even worse. The bottom of the pizza was so soggy the bottom of the box was wet. I couldn't even force myself to eat it. I hope I can figure out how to post a picture on here."}
{"text":"Just tried calling in a to-go order and again, they don't even answer the frigging phone, they just immediately slam it down into hold.  Quite possibly the RUDEST bunch of people I have come across EVER.  Go to the Shea location instead.  Not only do they have nice people working there, but the pizza is even better for some reason."}
{"text":"wtf is this place

my son wanted cheese bread like what we used to order from this amazing greek restaurant down the street from us. unfortunately we don't live there anymore and haven't even found a close comparison. either way, we were at albertsons and the smell of pizza drifted over to us as we walked back to our golf cart after shopping #onlyinarizona

we were weirdly greeted but its alright. this is a delivery place primarily I'm guessing because there is only two small benches inside for pick up orders. 

we just asked for an order of cheesy garlic bread and an order of breadsticks. we didn't order pizza, and i know i know its sorta not fair to review a pizza place for some damn bread but accept it ok

homegirl doesn't wash her hands and touches our bread.... touches a million other things... comes back to touch the bread more. meanwhile she put breadsticks in a deep fryer that wasn't even hot - and why weren't they just baked ??? idk i was confused.

long story short it took 15 minutes of uncleanliness and lack of cooking skills. we were given strings of undercooked dough and (while it tasted fairly good) probably contaminated cheese bread. ugh. i had to go home and honestly cook both things at 450 for FIFTEEN minutes. the breadsticks were finally cooked and i felt like maybe i cooked the germs off the cheese bread..... haaaa

whatever. gross place and dumb employees. i would recommend fricken pizza hut over these guys, its that bad"}
{"text":"Would sure like to order a pizza, but they keep putting me on hold. Oh well, I guess we'll go to Rocco's. They actually answer their phone over there.

My next experience was a good one, good pizza. I ordered that many hours before for a particular pick up time, half expecting for them to mess it up. They did a great job had it ready for me nice and hot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are both Italian and we're both from the East Coast. it's hard to find pizza that reminds us of home. I love the sauce here it's so good, most places have a really sweet sauce but Rosati's sauce is perfect. We ordered delivery tonight and it was quick and the delivery boy was super sweet.  I also got the Caesar salad which was pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't write very many reviews but the food was so delicious I HAD to! Recently I was in town visiting family and they wanted to order from their favorite delivery/carry out place. Since I'm from Chicago I'm very skeptical of places that claim they have \"Chicago style\" pizza. Well, Rosati's did not disappoint! 

We ordered a \"Chicago style\" cheese pizza, caprese salad (off the secret menu), mozzarella sticks, and chicken wings. The caprese salad and the mozz sticks were very yummy. I was very impressed at how many pieces were in the order. Rosati's definitely didn't skimp. The kids couldn't stop raving about how \"awesome\" the chicken wings were. 

As for the pizza, the sauce is incredible and the cheese was divine (my mouth is watering as I write this). You could really tell that they put a lot of care and use high quality ingredients in the food. 

Overall, I'm jealous for this of you that live in the area and get to experience this awesome place whenever you want. It will definitely be our go-to spot to order from whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Seriously some awesome owners,  employees, and patrons here.  Dropped my bank card out in the parking lot when I was leaving tonight.  Someone found it and turned it in to the owner and they in turn gave it to the gal at the front counter.  The gal (sorry don't recall your name) I always see the who works the register and takes orders, called the house (I wasn't even home yet with our tasty pizza) to let my hubby know it was found and they were holding it for safe keeping. Thank you to the owner,  the gal,  and the honest person who found my card and turned it over. :D  For that, along with the awesome pizza, you've earned our business for a long long while. And another glowing yelp review!"}
{"text":"Me and coworkers ordered, and picked up.  When one of the pizza's was wrong, we called.  They offered to send someone to deliver the correct pizza, but they wanted the old one back, even though some of us had already bitten into some of it.  Disgusting! Will never order from here again.. What, are they re-using it?? And believe me, we order from this place on average 4 times per week...all together from several different departments... They will miss our business."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. 
Consistently slow. Have to wait ages past quoted times even for pickup. Food is frequently cold or incorrect. 
Save yourself the trouble and drive a few miles to the 7th ave and union hills location."}
{"text":"Yes! A real thin crust, haven't had one in years.  AND the delivery was on time!  The pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"They have redeemed themselves.
Under the same owner but better management there have been immense improvements for the better.
I have been back several times and waited to make sure it is great every time and it sure is! 
Good job Rosati's !"}
{"text":"I ordered a lot of food from here and all I was happy with was the chicken wings. Pizza was nothing special and the chicken pasta was 2 stars worthy. If youre looking for regular pizza, this is your place."}
{"text":"The pizza itself was ok . Nothing to write home about though. I'm from New Jersey and have had much much better pizza. Also ridicously priced. Pizza here is more expensive than pizza in New York City. A pie was around 30 dollars. That's insane"}
{"text":"How can anyone give their pizza 5 Stars? Anyway, I ordered it for the first time. I had a thin crust and like one of the other Yelpers quoted.....The crust was like cardboard. The pizza wasn't horrid, but on the same quality of Papa Murphy's. I'm glad I didn't waste my time on a Chicago style pizza. Maybe the other food is good, but for pizza, I'm going back to Grimaldi's Pizza on Eastern."}
{"text":"Stopped in to use an expired Groupon. Shawn the Manager was great !! Very personable and informative. Service with a smile, which is always a plus !! Will be back !!"}
{"text":"I ordered online m, went to pick up my food and it was 20 min late, the staff was very apologetic and it seemed sincere. I got home ate our food and I get a call from the owner sincerely apologizing that they let us down. Yes our food was much later then we thought And that irritated me but to see the level of customer service this place had changed my whole tune. You don't find true customer service anymore and I dedicate my money to places that still hold those values so this place will definitely keep getting my money."}
{"text":"Awesome Deep Dish Chicago Style....two days later and I'm still feeding off the large!"}
{"text":"Great deep dish Chicago pizza and cheap drinks, what more could you want. Good wings too!"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was okay, but not spectacular. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in a long time.  I ordered from Uber Eats for home delivery.
I got the 12 inch thin crust pepperoni pizza.  This pizza was perfect.  Lots of cheese, not greasy, the crust was perfectly crisp, the sauce was delicious and a perfect amout of italian spices scattered on top, and it arrive hot.  This will be my go to pizza place.  Oh by the way I ordered from the Hualapia location in Summerlin.  P.S. I recommend ordering from Uber eats, and please tip your drivers!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time few days ago.....was off the chain good. Ordered for pickup and food was ready when they said it would be. Higlights so far is the jumbo wings that are huge and taste great and also the cheef sandwich. The deep dish was good...never had a pie that deep but was good. To make it 5 stars.....the waiting area is hot as hell....turn the air down and itll be all good."}
{"text":"First time trying Chicago-style Deep Dish Pizza. I didn't know the place was just a carry out so you should call ahead to order so you don't have to wait there. Service was really great and the pizza was really good. I'm a sauce type of girl so I wish there was a bit more sauce to compensate for so much bread but the sausage had a really great texture and flavor, the mushrooms were a perfect combo with it and the cheese gave me an amazing cheese pull for that Instagram story lol. Overall pretty great experience"}
{"text":"We haVe tried this place four times now.   Each time it was for delivery.  The first time we thought it was ok but they messed up the order a little.  I figured everyone makes mistakes now and then so we tried again this time he order was right but the food was under cooked and no good.   Then about a year later we tried again and they got the order wrong.  Then recently we tried and this was the last straw.   The food was wrong again and when I called to complain they said to bad that this is the way it was.  There was no offer to fix it or refund anything or credit me for the next order.  Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"What happens when you go to a restaurant where the food, service, and prices are nothing to write home about? In my case you write a review that is nothing to write home about. 

  If it weren't for somebody at work, I would never have caught Rosati's act. It is hidden in the 99 Cents shopping center at the southeast corner of Eastern Avenue at Warm Springs Road. However, the individual I talked to at work told me that I have to try Rosati's pizza. After dining in Rosati's I wonder if that person at work has tried Verazzano down the street, Grimaldi's, or Metro Pizza. 

  Yesterday driving back from Red Rock Canyon in the pouring rain, I figured that I would give Rosati's a try. When I walked in the older lady at the counter told me to sit anywhere. With both dining rooms being sparsely populated I chose a table nearer the counter. On this rainy Saturday afternoon they seemed to be doing a great deal more take out business. With that observation aside, she asked me what I wanted to drink while presenting me with a menu. 

  It took me a while deciding what to order. Not because everything seemed so good. Not at all. It took me so long to decide what to order because everything on it seemed higher price and menu offerings that I find at many pizzerias and Italian restaurants were missing here. This included individual slices of pizza, eggplant parmegaina, and my favorite the eggplant parmegaina sub. After the second time that the waitress checked in on me, I asked her if they serve individual slices of pizza. She responded to the inquiry by saying that they only serve slices during their weekday special. Now that I sipped some of the Coke and was too embarrassed to return to the rain soaked streets of Vegas, I decided on the six chicken wings. 

   The six chicken wings seemed to be close to the only entree on the menu under $10. Earlier I had myself a big breakfast in the Del Mar Deli and did not build enough of an appetite to spend around $20 for a dinner. The six chicken wings costed $6.95 and the bottomless Coke costed $2. Several minutes went by until the waitress presented the wings to my table. I ordered the spicy chicken wings with ranch sauce. They had a decent taste to them. But in similar style to chicken wings they were extremely sticky. I got good use of the napkins. That's for sure. 

   As far as service, just like the place it was nothing to write home about. The waitress was neither nasty nor friendly. It would have been appreciated  if she would of asked me if I could of used more Coke. After a few hours of hiking in Red Rock Canyon, I could of used a top off of Coke. Finally when I paid at the counter, I let her know that I left her tip on the table. She gave me the attitude of, \"whatever.\" There was a warmth to Rosati's that was missing. 

   When there is nothing to write home about a restaurant there is an infinitesimal chance of it being my home away from home. I don't live in Siberia. The reality is that there is far better competition within a couple of miles of Rosati's that includes Verazzano Pizza, Mama Depalma's, Metro Pizza, and Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Daughter Alexa gave us extraordinarily good service. The food was tasty and totally plentiful. 
Nice dinner,  easy, relaxed surroundings. 
Will Do again. 
Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The pizza hear is very good and the people were very friendly everything was just like they said it was the food was fresh u could tell by looking at it not to mention the flavor"}
{"text":"Have you ever been sick after eating Rosati's?  Upset stomach? As a former contractor for the restaurant, I can confirm the current owners are incapable of keeping the business safe for customers.  Don't risk it, they haven't the slightest clue what restaurant borne illness does to the human body"}
{"text":"Yup. I stand by my convictions. Tried a new pizza from here, and some boneless chicken tenders. As far as the chicken tenders- they were lightly breaded and just tangy enough. And the pizza was, as I've come to expect, absolutely amazing. Their deliveries are always prompt, and their prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation in my search for a pie which would satisfy my inner Chicagoan. Walked into the restaurant and was told that we could sit anywhere... alright, so far so good. Place looks clean, dimly-lit with a few games on, bar and seating look roomy enough, service was friendly... this could work. 

So we sat and looked over the menu. The options for pizza were thin, double-dough, and pan pizza. No deep-dish or Chicago-style option (note:  some people might think that 'deep dish' and 'Chicago-style' are synonymous, but this isn't truly the case... \"deep dish\" is usually what people THINK Chicago pizza is like, but often falls short of the mark in one way or another). So I asked the server and she said that the pan pizza was deep-dish. So we ordered a large meat pan pizza and a smaller thin-crust with sausage and mushrooms for my padr√©. Took a little while to come out but that's never a problem for me- I'll wait patiently for food. No stars off for that. The service was friendly and attentive, and our drinks never got below halfway full.

So the pizzas came out, and a frown darkened my brow.

Looking at our 'pan' pizza, I couldn't help but notice the colossal wall of crust surrounding it. It honestly looked like a regular pizza with a very large retaining wall of crust around the edges. That is most assuredly *NOT* Chicago-style, nor is it even deep-dish. A proper Chicago pizza should have a soft, tasty dough bottom, Then a layer of delicious cheese, THEN a layer of topping, and THEN a layer of tomato sauce (which should be thick and heavy, NOT lumpy and water!!!). This honestly just looked like something that you would have ordered from XYZ chain delivery with a wall built around it. Me dad's thin-crust looked about like a thin-crust pizza could be expected to look... but... it looked 'sad', if that makes any sense...?

Taking a few bites of my pizza, I was not impressed. Not at all. I was quite angry.

As Larry David would say:  I was preeeeettyyyyy, preeeettyyyyy, prettyyyyy, pretty upset.

I can't say that the pizza tasted TERRIBLE, so I can't give this place one star, and I'm sure that there are people who will come here and enjoy it just fine. It tasted like a pizza, but it was most assuredly *NOT* a Chicago pizza. And it wasn't nearly as good as any of the pizzas which I've gotten delivered from Rosati's Val Vista location. I've ALWAYS been very happy with those pizzas, even their thin-crust has knocked my socks off. This visit, however, left me extremely unhappy. Disillusioned, one might say. I've come to accept the fact that I can't find a good Chicago pizza out here in the Valley, and I've learned to love a new pie in a different way. But someone directly messaged me and told me to try this place out, so I had pretty high hopes. Once again, I have walked away a sad, sad man. I took half of it home, but honestly I won't eat a bite of it."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Ordered a pizza for delivery and was told it would be there in an hour. At the 1 hour point, they called and said there was a problem with the card they had on file. I gave them the updated expiration date, and they said it would be right there. At the hour and 20 minute point I called and asked for the manager, and was put on hold for 5 minutes. Told the manager to cancel the order as it was late. At the 1 hour and 35 minute point the driver shows up with the pizza. Told him to return it as it was late. Next day checked my card, and they had processed it. Called and was given a run around about it. So disputed the charge and got my money refunded. No longer a Rosati's customer."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've ordered ten times in the past month and a half it's so good.   Thank you for giving me faith back in local pizza places.   Thin crust is on point with tons of cheese!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Sandwiches were terrible. Charged me for a sandwich we did not order. Called and spoke to the owner, did not care his food sucks. 6 onion rings cost 6 bucks. Terrible, terrible."}
{"text":"Keep asking this place to cook the chi style pizza \"well done\" so we don't get a ball of dough, this is the second time it shows up raw, even after you ask to cook it correctly, so done with this Rosati's, what a disrespect to Chicago"}
{"text":"We ordered las night from rosati's, and my everyone loved it.... It was better than Amore Taste of Chicago Pizza......AND I WAS BORN AND RAISED there for over 32 years!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was customer's of Rosati's for years! Now they have new owner's, we ordered a medium pepperoni ..... well guess what guys! If y'all are going to cut back on the way you make the pizza we won't be back! The crust was thinner, the sauce was not the same, it was grease and hardly had any pepperoni on it ! And for what you charged I'll go to Pizza Hut and get a better pizza for half the price.  We paid more for Rosati's pizzas cause it was high quality full of toppings and worth the price! Not no more!!!!!! So sad!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the area. Always on point and very good service. Order form here all the time and a well deserved five star"}
{"text":"I was always happy with their other location which is why i stopped in for lunch.  I was disappointed in the 2 slice lunch special here.  It was literally one slice of pizza cut in half and took over 15 minutes to be served."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Rosati's. I have been to several locations in the valley. This location will be one that I don't return to. I bought a Groupon specific to this location, that's how I ended up here. They don't have the same specials at this location that they have at 3 other locations. I was like really? Ya'll are gonna charge me almost $10 for a sandwich with no drink or fries when the other locations don't? I usually order the italian beef that comes with fries and a drink for under $10. The charged me 50 cent for cheese and another 50 cent for the pickled veggies. They didn't have the wine that was listed on the menu. That wasn't a problem until I asked for wine and they told me to refer to the menu. Why don't ya'll tell me what u do have since it's turned into a guessing game? Supposedly it was Happy Hour but not for wine? The pizza was good though. Good luck! The owners at this location seemed fickled and cheap. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I get delivery from here often, one night I requested a side of ranch to dip my pizza in. The delivery guy forgot it. A couple weeks later I ordered a peperoni pizza again.  I was pleasantly surprised when I greeted my delivery guy ( sorry I forgot his name, super nice) and he says, \"I have the ranch that I forgot last time\".  Not only did he remember who I was, he remembered that small detail!!! So impressed!!! 

Pizza is delicious,  I am gonna venture out and get a calzone in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas! I have been searching for years for this type of pizza and I finally found it here about 6 years ago. Problem is I now eat a lot more pizza. Very tasty pizza! I always get the thin crust and it's always been great. I tried one of their other locations and it wasn't as good as this location. Thanks for the great pizza over the years Rosati's!"}
{"text":"Good food but prices a bit high.  Great staff.  No atmosphere, but not really expected.  We usually order take out.  Tiny bar.  Go for the Chicago style pie."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best pizza in the city.  Originally being from the midwest I never could get used to the greasy New York style pizza that seems to be so popular here.  I haven't tried the deep dish but I will tell you that the thin crust is pretty much just like I used to get back home.  Cracker thin with a crunch, fresh tomato sauce, and toppings that go under the cheese... this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Found this finger nail in our pizza from Rosatis on Losee. We could not be anymore grossed out.  And to make a bad situation worse when my wife called to talk to the manager Ashley, she could of cared less and stated that since we found it in our leftovers and not the night that we bought the pizza there's Nothing she could do.  I guess we weren't lucky enough to bite into that gem the night we purchased the pizza.  You would think that a manager would go above and beyond to fix a disgusting and disgraceful situation.  But no not Ashley, my wife had to literally ask for am apology.  That is horrible"}
{"text":"tried them several time and each time something was wrong...first time driver went to wrong town for delivery, second food was cold, third order was wrong and they didn't seem to care"}
{"text":"We visit this place anytime we are even a little bit close to the area, we went an hour of course today to come here! The wings are great, pizza's great and the service is awesome! Atmosphere is cool, brick walks, street lights inside..cool music playing. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Yep..we ordered pizza! And it sure was good. It usually is pretty amazing but this time the cheese tasted so fresh I had to give em 5 stars!
One slice of the super thick Chicago & Im a happy mommy.
Now we have leftovers..yum!"}
{"text":"Clean and welcoming neighborhood establishment. Good for families, watching your game, and being around your favorite people! Love the boneless wings and thin crust pizza! Try their buttery, doughy garlic knots! They are yummy!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large thin crust pizza to go after seeing all of the rave on here. However, i was disappointed after taking one bite of the pizza. My $20 pizza had the texture of an ovened $1 frozen pizza that has been left out to dry. It was my first time eating at rosati's, so i gave an extra star for i may have just ordered the wrong type of pizza. Unfortunately, i probably won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Perfection once again from my favorite family owned pizzeria right here in chandler. Thanks for always being so friendly and great with ideas of something yummy  to try. Julia rocks!"}
{"text":"rude staff, prices on website not the same in store, they were higher. wings are good but the pizza is subpar. but the way the staff treated me and including the manager, giving it 1 star is too much."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place was amazing! Great food, decent prices, and amazing service. Chay was our waitress and she was so helpful and accommodating. We don't live here but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffets always seem like a great idea, especially when priced at $7.50 like at Rosati's.  And then you get back to work and spend the entire afternoon trying to stay awake after stuffing yourself with pizza.  Since I've been here on several occasions, I still haven't learned my lesson.

The lunch buffet here is simple and seems to always be the same.  Two pizzas are set out at a time, and the salad bar has your basics: lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, etc.  Nothing too special, but again, it's $7.50 for all you can eat!  The pizza here is decent, but it's not a pie that I crave for.  If you're near a Rosati's for lunch, it's a solid value that makes it easy to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Well it was ok and delivery was on par.  I prefer Portillos but this was a good alternative.  Sandwich was good but fries were soggy with no ketchup.  All in all it was ok"}
{"text":"Wasn't the best pizza I've ever had but it was very tasty and extremely filling.  I couldn't finish it for sure.  Got the double crust and the toppings were plentiful."}
{"text":"I went here for a date and I can still taste those bread sticks/ twists. The owner makes it all fresh and you can taste the ingredients!

AND food is reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Was fairly ehhh.
Got the deep dish style.. I think it was undercooked. It was very difficult to get a slice out of the box, without everything disappearing off the slice, onto the cardboard.

Going to Full House tomorrow."}
{"text":"Awesome deep dish Chicago style pizza! The deep dish pizza is definitely a must try. They use fresh mozzarella, and an awesome tomato sauce that is to die for. The crust is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It does take a while to bake these, so if you are doing delivery plan ahead. It usually takes about 40 minutes to bake plus delivery time-  but it is definitely worth the wait! Also, the garlic bread with cheese is a nice add on appetizer. The delivery person was extremely friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Never have to ask them for more cheese. This is the best pizza I have had.  Took 3 extra large to an outdoor party where they had 24 people and this was the hit. Everyone kept asking, where did you get it. They make it perfect. The I-17 and Thunderbird is perfect. The party was at Deem Hills park on 51st Avenue and Happy Valley road (just North of Happy Valley) and it was still warm when I got there. What a hit. Love this place."}
{"text":"The first thing j want to say is this is ideally and take out/delivery place. It even says that for this location on their website. So to the rude lady that was grunting when I was leaving, you're a fool.

I got the Veggie speciality pizza and it was so yummy. This is the best pizza I've had here since I've moved here from NY. Got a 12\" size and it was perfect for me and my plus one. Would absolutely order from here again!"}
{"text":"The cashier messed up my order but the mannger fixed it! i order a deep dish and got a thin crust but the swap the pizzas for me no extra cost! Great service! The pizza was huge. I order the deep dish too much cheese on the pizza needs more sauce than cheese. The cheese was REALLY fresh just too much off it on the pizza!! I'm willing to comeback! there's no dining room :("}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I have now been on hold for over 20 minutes. And before this I got hung up on. Good luck ordering from here, I hope you're not very hungry. Looks like this place has gone down hill and management needs to hire more people or train the ones they have. Boooooo"}
{"text":"have to admit, not as good as Rosati's in Chicago, but they get 5 stars!
came in on a slow Monday night with my girlfriend after a long drive.
super clean and friendly service, Carlos is an awesome person!
they give evilly yummy garlic bread bites, smooth creamy tiramisu
as for the pizza itself, the crust is awesome, but the sauce was too tangy.
overall, it was so good, we came here 2x during our 3days stay in Vegas.
come here and check them out! and remember to say HI to Carlos! :)"}
{"text":"Holy hell this is good pizza!

I ordered for our family last night, just in time to turn on MNF.  Now, I haven't eaten at a Rosati's in over 5 years so I was highly disappointed that this is one of the remaining West Side locations.  Only a few years ago they were like 7-11's and there wasn't and address in Las Vegas where they didn't have delivery service. 

I had been to this location back in 07 or 08 and I was quite impressed when I walked in.  Apparently they have added a dining area and there is a nice Tuscan feel to it.  Keep in mind though, it is still a pizza place.  Not worthy of bringing the Nikon to see authentic Italian art.

We ordered the Chicago Style Deep Dish and it was everything I remembered.  Golden crisp crust layered with cheese, pep's and sauce on top.  I ordered a large, fully expecting to have left overs (the pizza box weighed close to 5 lbs) and we devoured every bit of it.  Seriously, the dog snuck in the trash and ate most of the cardboard overnight!

This was the best pizza I have had in months, if not years.  A great flavor, good seasonings, great sauce, healthy amount of cheese, not to mention friendly staff!

I was very impressed to see how much their menu has expanded as well!  Quite a few items if you don't want pizza (which I would highly recommend).

Great job, Rosati's!  I will be back... soon!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever ate!  A large mushroom pizza had an adequate amount of mushrooms for two slices. Had enough sauce for two large pizzas. Cheese was chewy, crust was hard."}
{"text":"Not the place for you if you like your thin crust pizza crispy and spicy.  Ordered two for delivery- both crusts were very soggy and a bit undercooked.  The toppings were extremely bland- even sausage, onions, peppers- the usual spicy stuff.  We added red pepper, Tabasco, etc, to no avail.  Put  one pizza in a preheated oven in an effort to crisp it up, but the crust was not very thin, and came out rock hard after a few minutes.  A lot of wasted pizza and two hungry, frustrated, non-diners. 

I hesitated to write a bad review because the customer service was excellent- very friendly and efficient on the phone and arrived on time.  The customer service earned 4 stars, but the pizza was a -3"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to go over there despite the mixed reviews. We had a craving for pizza and thought a happy hour that was in the neighborhood would work out. 
What we found was the service was as bad as many of the reviews. The one person covering the bar seemed to care less about the customers. When we ordered our drinks, we asked for water....it didn't come. When the pizza we ordered finally arrived (after 30 minutes) we asked for water again and they finally came. By the way, the pizza was not good. 
Too bad because we like to support neighborhood places, but I don't think we will be going here any time soon."}
{"text":"why does the pizza have taco spice flavor to it? this is driving me and my other family members nuts.. we have not yet complained about it but we are going to start.. this is the second pizza that has a spice to it.. not a normal pizza spice taste.. I feel like Im eating pizza taco..."}
{"text":"Guaranteed to be something wrong with your order.

I ordered a greek salad and got ceaser with no dressing. 

They gave a me a credit for my next order so I gave another chance and ordered a Hawaiian pizza w BBQ sauce. They put tomato sauce and knowing the previous situation the manager said, \"There's nothing I can do.\"

You'd be better off getting frozen pizza than ordering from here."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot! Those little squares will get you in trouble. Because in you're mind you're like \"just one more piece\" and then you look up and you've eaten the majority of the pizza a by yourself (not that I'm complaining or anything). They deliver which is great. On a Friday or Saturday night place your order early, they get pretty swamped on the weekends. Just writing about them makes me hungry...lol."}
{"text":"Love to come here and get my Chicago Pizza fix! It helps that it's only a mile from my house so we usually pick-up-easier and cheaper. We go so often the staff knows us there and always gives us great service. Make sure you try their Garlic Bread with Mozzarella, Tomato & Spinach...soooo good! Recently we ventured away from pizza, ravioli, etc. and tried their Italian Beef and their BBQ ribs. OMG! Their Italian Beef (as well as the bread - very important) was amazing! No need to wait for Portillos to open their stores here. Sorry to say the ribs were terrible and we will not be ordering them again. They offer catering and the staff will even bring the food out to your vehicle for you. We buy their \"certificate\" deals every time they are available which makes this a VERY affordable place to get good food. They also offer coupons in the mail and online AND they have daily specials including a \"by the slice\" lunch deal. All of the Rosati's locations in the Valley are not run by the same franchisee so if you have had bad food at a Rosati's elsewhere, give this one a try. If you like Chicago style pizza, you'll be glad you stopped in. http://www.myrosatis.com/home/"}
{"text":"One staff is so untrained. 
I feel really bad for them. 
No manager around to protect them from the beating this Old Lady is giving this little girl. I think I heard the girl apologize like 10 times. She is trying. 
We were trying to give this place a 2nd try. Might be last."}
{"text":"I have had this place in the past. Never disappointed. Sweet chili wings are very good. The customer service was also great."}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish that they said would take 30-40 mins...when I got there it was a thin crust. Was offered no apology or fix for the situation..I drove home hungry and hopefully my credit card will be refunded.. well see"}
{"text":"Don't get the Chicago pizza  
It was watery undercooked over cheesed would not recommend ."}
{"text":"I don't come to the north side of Las Vegas very often, but when I do, this is the place to be. I've never tried Chicago deep dish pizza and this was the place where I got to try it. It was amazing! I got so full off of two pieces since they're filled with a lot of stuff. So good.
I also recently got a 12 inch personal pan. Half cheese and half pepperoni, thin crust. Amazing. Everything is just made simple yet everything is so delicious. I love coming here for the pizza! Sadly, I don't have any photos because I always start eating lmfao."}
{"text":"It's funny to me how down hill this place has gone and no one is doing anything about it. I was a customer from day 1 when they first opened and I'll still go from time to time thinking MAYBE THEY WILL CHANGE. But no, they don't. Wings suck, the sauce was straight oil the last time I went. Pizza was not the original thin crust I used to get. The big manager guy or owner who ever he is was just straight rude to his female employee who was working the floor. While I was sitting at the bar top I heard a phone call between my waitress and someone calling about asking for a job. The manager then proceeded to tell his employee to tell them HE IS ONLY HIRING GIRLS UNDER 21. Ok, what?????? Something needs to change about this place and quick!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this particular Rosati's 10 stars I would! Just because not only is their food AMAZING, but their customer service is always top-notch too! They are my go-to Chicago style pizza, salads, pastas & sandwich place when we need to order @ work (South Point). Absolutely everything we've ordered has been delish! We usually order White Chicken Alfredo Pizza, but we've had their Lasagna, Alfredo Carbonara Pasta, Ital Beef Sandwiches, Ital Sausage Pizza, Deep Fried Mushrooms, & the Spinach Salads. So if you're reading this and getting hungry...just order already! :) I promise you'll enjoy every bite! 

And in these days of delivery services like Bite Squad, Eat 24 & etc...it's amazing that their very own delivery people & wait times are so great too! 

I work with the public too. And it's so refreshing to be treated well when it's my turn to be the customer for a change. Rosati's on Silverado Ranch consistently does that for me & my co-workers! Thank you big heaps! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend for a late lunch after a trip to the nearby Lowe's. The owner waited on us and was friendly and helpful. More than just the standard chit-chat makes it seem more family friendly to me. They have CRAFT BEERS and although I didn't partake this time, I will next! Owner is also a veteran, so THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch... the pizza was OK, not that great.

I ordered the thin crust which was more like a regular crust... which was fine.  The sauce could use some improvement, it tasted like regular tomato sauce, not pizza (marinara) sauce.  Also ordered some fried and onions rings... the best part of my meal were the fries.

I probably will not be coming here again.

Also, the girl at the front counter doesn't have the greatest customer service skills."}
{"text":"This pizza place was my godson's favorite place to get pizza he loves it because those slices are very large and that the pizzas not really crispy & kind of soggy. So us adults ,we did eat the pizza. I  think the sauce and sausages  had a good flavor. The pizza had a generously amount of cheese and marinara sauce which made the bottom crust soggy soft. So what me and my best friend ended up doing was putting the pizza back into the oven to give that pizza good bottom Crisp crust."}
{"text":"This is what I imagine Chicago pizza taste like. Wow. We ordered last night. Arrived at our time share(Grandview). Hot! And full of flavor. Still great today. Sauces were wrapped for hot serving with bread sticks.  pizza pie! wonderful! Chicken was hot and tasty. Will order Next year's vacation. Thank U!"}
{"text":"My parents are both from Chicago and the greater Chicago area and this is the only place they'll order pizza from. They like thin crust pizza and Rosati's does a nice job making a light and crispy crust that can hold a decent amount of toppings. We also order the Italian beef and sausage sandwiches from time to time and we always enjoy them. It may be a little pricier than your standard pizza chains but the food is better. Hope this helps you make an informed decision."}
{"text":"It would have been nice to see if they actually HAVE good pizza. I went into their dining room and waited to be seated. Two waitresses and only one table occupied.  Despite being only five feet from them, neither bothered to acknowledge me or ask if I wanted to sit down. They were too busy talking and deciding which CD to play. After waiting for a time, I walked out.  I couldn't believe how rude they were."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and I ordered delivery. The girl on the phone got my order completely wrong it took them an hour to deliver it. They gave me fettuccine instead of chicken Alfredo and hot wings instead of BBQ. My Alfredo was curdled and full of oil, it looked so gross. I called the girl back and got my order fixed. It took them over an hour again and my chicken Alfredo was gross too :( the noodles were not cooked all the way and it was curdled and full of oil like swimming in oil. My chicken looked like it was boiled. Long story short I went to bed hungry :( and I'm pregnant so that was very sad lol. I will never order from here again, not worth it. Burros is hands down way better."}
{"text":"Rosati's is one of the better pizza options in the Valley. I've only had the thin crust, but it is excellent. The center is rarely underdone or droopy. They cut it into squares rather than pie slices, which is a minor annoyance.

Stay away from the pasta; it's wet, the marinara is obviously canned and quite runny, and it's overloaded with cheese. The garlic bread is ok, but it won't save one of their pasta dinners. But it's a pizza place, so I won't ding them for bad pasta. The salads are so-so; heavy on the iceberg lettuce but still fresh, so don't shy away if you want to combine a salad with a little pizza for a lighter dinner.

The atmosphere is inviting, with decorations reminiscent of Chicago without being overwhelming (I'm talking to you, Pizzeria Uno). The staff is decent, though they're often hidden in the kitchen or bar and not often at the tables."}
{"text":"Still the best tasting pizza around. I grew up in New York and lived in Chicago. When I ordered today, they found a coupon for me. The main reason I am doing another review is to let people know that they are expanding and will have indoor and outdoor seating in a few weeks and an expanded menu including Chicago style hot dogs"}
{"text":"I got the chicago pizza and it far exceeded my expectations. I will definitely go here again. The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for over 7 years. Placed a simple phone order for 3 salads and a pizza. Previous experiences have been great. Tonight we received 2 salads that were not what we ordered. Being a faithful customer, I thought bringing it to the attention of management would help them fix the issue.
When I called and asked to speak to the manager I was told in an extremely smart assed tone that \"we have new management\". 
I was on hold for over 4 minutes when another smart assed and unprofessional by the name of Aniyae (spelling unknown) picked up the phone. I told her I was holding for the manager Jason. She rudely let me know she \"wasn't the one I talked to earlier.\"  She had a very snide attitude like I was bothering her by wanting tospeak to a manager. Rather than saying, \"yes, allow me a moment to get him\" or letting me know that he was dealing with another customer....she huffed into the phone. 
Jason got on the phone after 5 minutes of holding. He let me know that they had come in over the weekend and changed menus. When I look online and see what I am ordering, it is important for me to get just that. I let him know of the issues we had with our order and was not looking for any compensation. I was at this point pissed about the lack of customer service skills I received from his staff. He tried to again offer a credit to which I again refused. I told Jason his staff was a reflection of him as a manager, the owners etc. What was simply constructive criticism to an establishment that we never experienced our orders being one way on the receipt and yet our order completely different when delivered. We definitely never experienced this type of customer service; or there lack of... customer service.We will not be back.
Your customers keep your business going. Without us your business fails. Looks like some serious training is in dire need before you lose even more customers."}
{"text":"First of all I was from the Chicago burbs and was really concerned about the pizza locations nearby.  I was happy to find Rosati's was a delivery call away.  I love the \"Fab 4\" and always get a free small cheese for whoever is vegan.  Love the thin crust pizzas!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza place pizza I have ever had.  I felt like I had microwave pizza.

Came in on a Sunday (very slow)  with my Groupon. First off, the gal helping us must have not liked us, because it was showing.  

Ordered the Chicago deep dish, which is the only reason we came here. Having been to Rosati's in Encinitas we expected good pizza from here.  We weren't expecting Echo Park's Masa, but Rosati's status....

The sauce was good flavor and good amount of tomatoes.  The quality of the cheese and pepperonis was also good.  The bad was there was hardly any cheese and pepperoni on this pizza.  I mean at least say \"hey if you want normal amount, we have to charge you extra.\"  I would have paid more.  That doesn't matter anyway I guess because the pizza crust bottom, and sides was disgusting.  I say disgusting, I mean hard, thin, crunchy, gross.  I felt like I had the $1.00 pizza from the freezer aisle.  We knew we would never come back.  

We also had the boneless wings and side salad.  It was whatever.  This place had no problem serving us a skimpy, gross pizza and charging us for 2 additional sides of ranch.  The iced tea (unsweetened) is also not good, it tastes dirty. 

Less than a car ride to the house, my son and I became very ill.  We had to stop and purchase alka seltzer and water.  I have never become sick from a food place, and I am not someone that calls out food poisoning ever on my YELP reviews, but this is the closest thing I have to call it.  We narrowed it down to the wings or ranch.  There were 4 of us in the party and 2 became sick.  One of the people in our group didn't eat any ranch, or wings.  

I wouldn't come back even if I didn't leave feeling like I had to barf, because the pizza sucks.  

I did find that there is a Chicago deep dish pizza at Giordanna's on the strip.  The strip is not my first choice for a pizza place, but I would take that over illness any day. 

Get it together Rosati's you are a chain, live up to your name.  We were so impressed by the Encinitas location that they brought your our business, and now you have shot down any future business for yourself or anyone else in the chain.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Second visit.  First was bad but thought I would try it again.  I was the only customer but the counter guy had phone orders backed up.  Just ordered the two pieces of pizza in hot box to go.  The boxes they gave me were not closed in any way.  Was lucky to get to the car without spilling the pizza out of the boxes.  Way too acidic for my taste.  Ate part of one piece - terrible.  Gave the other half to my dogs and threw the second piece away.  Some one needs to do some quality taste testing.  I love crust and the crust wasn't even worth eating.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  I'm me in town and had issues with my lodging.  Had to stay in a hotel for a few nights and this was one of two places that delivered.  The employee that answered the phone was very courteous and friendly.  The deliver staff was just the same.  Eggplant Parm, cheesy garlic bread and caprese salad were all delicious and large portions.  Cannoli's were to die for!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's with all the negative reviews. Just ate half my gluten free pizza with green bell pepper & onion and I can't wait to eat the other half. 

There aren't many pizza joints that offer a gluten free crust so for that they get high marks. Also, being from Chicago I consider myself to a bit of a pizza aficionado and Rosatis reminds me of old school Chicago pizza!"}
{"text":"Finally, a \"Chicago style\" pizza joint that actually tastes like Chicago pizza!

I am a true Chicagoan (not the suburbs) living here in Phoenix and made it my mission to find great pizza in AZ. Since living here I've tried lots of pizza, but none moved me as much as Rosati's. Contrary to popular belief, \"Chicago style\" pizza is not just deep dish pan pizza, it can be thin crust and delicious. My sister and I split the thin crust (onion, mushroom, green bell pepper) and it reminded us so much of home. Now all you need to do is open a restaurant in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always Great Pasta, Pizza, Salads and delivery. We eat a lot of Rosattis great family."}
{"text":"I've eaten here now twice, and I'm sorry to say I wouldn't recommend it. I ate there the first time because it is one of the only places to get food near Doc Cavalliere park. We ordered a pizza. It took forever and it wasn't very good. 

The second time, I only went back because, again, we were at the park and my kids were really hungry. I quickly bought a groupon because I didn't want to pay full price for not very good food. We ordered 2 slices of pizza with a drink, the chopped salad, the hot dog kids meal, and the Italian beef sandwich. The total would have been $31 without the groupon. It took us 25 minutes to get our food. Then the woman tells me she made sure they put my au jus on the side for my sandwich. I reminded her that we also ordered pizza, as she had not given it to me in my order, and she added it. Seriously, she totally forgot the pizza. 

Then we get to the park, and I find that the au jus she so kindly had them put on the side was non-existent. The sandwich was not good. My daughter threw the other half for me in the desert for the critters to eat up. Maybe it would have been better with the elusive au jus.

My little girl's kids meal, which contained a small hot dog, some fries, and a tiny fountain drink was $5.99. Rip off.

The salad was okay, but the ranch they serve there is soybean oil based, and I hate soybean oil based ranch dressing. Is it really that hard to mix it yourself at your restaurant? Most restaurants do now. Also, they gave us one fork for three people, so we had to take turns with it. Why even bother putting one fork in? I guess they figured only one person was going to be eating the salad, but still.

Again, the pizza was meh, and my daughter only ate one slice. The other slice was for the critters and birds.

Rosati, you should get yourself together. I won't eat here again even with a groupon. It's not even worth the discounted price."}
{"text":"Came to this location recently for a football game with some friends. Although this place is conveniently located near our place, we probably won't be coming back due to two things. The food is decent, overpriced and took about 45 minutes with about 20 people in the restaurant. Could have been a fluke, but the lack of urgency is something I wasn't a fan of."}
{"text":"Although conveniently located near our place, that might be the only reason we come back in the near future. The food was good, but it took almost 50 minutes to receive our one pizza with only 3 people in the place. There didn't seem to be any sense of urgency, not only with the food, but with getting waters refilled."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered another Fabulous Four, as carryout, as I always do. Got all the way home and opened up the box to find a cheese pizza. Now I'm back at Rosati's waiting another 30 min for them to start over and make what I ordered."}
{"text":"Here's the thing - the food is great.  Hands down, our favorite pizza and wings.  But the service at the Ahwatukee location is awful. This is the 2nd time I have shown up to pick up my order when they said it would be done and it hasnt even been made - nothing.  I got an apology today.  Considering the fact that our kid would prefer Native or Dominos where we would spend 1/3 the amount, I may think twice before ordering from Rosatis again. And its sad, because the pizza and wings are truly the best!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the 59th and union hills location. I thought it was eat in, my bad. Having said that we came about 1:30 pm there was no one up front and there was one person running around who didn't even knowledge us. We went out of our way to seek out this place and wound up going across the way to Sonic"}
{"text":"Soupy lasagne.  Not able to serve this to anyone.  At 65.00 a pan and you need a bowl and spoon.  We called to let them know they said they have never had problems. I doubt that's true.   See photos"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, cheese bread, and salad while watching football. It arrived nice and hot (the pizza and bread). I love cheese and they didn't disappoint. We even had to cut it again because of the gooey goodness. We will order from here every chance we get during football season!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good food and friendly customer service, don't come here! I placed an order over the phone and the guy I spoke to was incredibly rude and sarcastic and the attitude didn't improve when I came to pick up my order. They ended up messing up the order and when I spoke to the manager about it, he literally said oh you want Dominos? Unless you want horrible customer service and overpriced food, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza - nice & thin & crispy. Always pleasant staff, always delicious and quite affordable. We frequently order by phone on the way home from the airport, & pizza is always ready to go upon arrival! If you're hungry for great pizza - this is your place!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings!! Great and friendly staff , will definitely order again. Just became my new favourite pizza joint!!"}
{"text":"Just not as good as the original store on Shea and Scottsdale Road"}
{"text":"I'm from New Jersey but currently relocated to Phoenix from California so anyway.....I ordered pizza from here two days ago and it was sooooooooooooooooooo delicious!!!!!! Glad I moved from California cause they never had good pizza places."}
{"text":"We were regular customers at the Rosati's on Ellsworth & Brown (different ownership group) but kept having issues. One day it dawned on me that this Rosati's is actually closer to where we live!

We have ordered from this location three times now (all thin crust, haven't tried their deep dish yet) and every time the person taking the order had been pleasant, the orders have been correct with no errors and the pizzas have looked and tasted great! This is the best Chicago style thin crust I have had in the Valley and the best pizza overall for that matter.

This store is conveniently located less than a mile south of the 60, so it's not too far from half the East Valley, what're you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Yesterday I called to order a pizza at about 3:45. The man who answered the phone asked if I could wait and I said yes. Three minutes later I hung up and called the Rosati's on Power & Baseline. The man that answered that phone asked me if I could wait as well. The difference is that a woman came on the line about 10 second later and took my order.

I called this Rosati's about a month ago (I don't remember what day) and the woman who answered the phone asked me if I could wait and I said yes. I waited three minutes (not exaggerating I checked the timer on my phone both times) and then hung up and ordered a pizza from the Rosati's on Power Road.

The last time that I could actually get someone to take my order at this Rosati's they messed up my pizza! I asked for extra cheese and sausage (I wouldn't have rob ask for extra cheese if they put enough on). When I picked it up I didn't check it assuming it would be right. When I got home it was just extra cheese but no sausage. I have ordered sausage thin crust pizza regularly from this Rosati's for the last 8 or 9 months since I moved back to Mesa. I'm pretty sure it says that in their ordering software. 

I wasn't going to complain about the pizza that was made incorrectly because I have complained before (and got a credit) and because mistakes happen.

Between the incorrectly made pizza, the lack of cheese on the pizzas ordered in the past, and the people on the phones that leave people on hold for three minutes or more I am done with this Rosati's.

** Not trying to be mean but the two times I've gotten pizza at the Rosati's on Power Road it was noticeably better than the pizza from this Rosati's! (Maybe because they have two different ownership groups and the one on Power is the other group)"}
{"text":"Their lasagna is great. Available in both meat and no meat versions. Large portions. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Fast service friendly staff and good pizza deals for lunch! 2 slices for $6 it wasn't very busy during late lunch."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars for now. Nice place good atmosphere. Service is ok. Love the bar, ice cold beer, big tv's so good for watching sports. So here's the thing for me, any Italian place I go to is first judged by their pizza. I had a couple of slices and was very disappointed. Starting with the taste of the sauce, so so at best. The crust was like eating a pretzel. I realize this is supposed to be Chicago style but I didn't even get the deep dish. Crust & sauce fell flat for me. With my slices I got a side salad. Weak, very week. I will try this place again, I want to check out their pasta. Hopefully then I can up my review. Dutch~"}
{"text":"OMG, what can I say? Rosati's has the best pizza I've ever had. By far the best pizza in Vegas. We ordered the thin crust (ask for extra thin - like the Southside of Chicago) and we tried the deep dish. Both were very very good, but the extra thin crust was my favorite. Great service, very friendly. This should be your neighborhood pizza joint. :)"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here.  First and last time customers.  I should have known when the girl told me on the phone that the \"pan\" and \"Chicago style\" deep dish are the same.  Seriously? They are not.  

So we ordered a small thin crust and a small deep dish/pan for a total of $32.   I have had better $5 pizza from a gas station, and I mean way better.  Thin crust = inedible cardboard. \"Deep dish\" was all dough, cheese on the top... Not any Chicago style I've had before.  


Both had the same bland sauce, nothing memorable about the cheese, and the few and far between toppings were par at best.

There's nothing positive I can say about this experience."}
{"text":"Life's too short to eat mediocre pizza.  That pretty much sums up my feelings about Rosati's.  Stranded on the west side and in need of lunch, the WaunaQueen and I decided to give Rosati's a shot.  She ordered a slice of the pepperoni, I opted the Cheef sandwich, Italian Beef with covered with melted mozzarella cheese.

Both offerings were exceptionally mediocre.  The crust reminded me of what you get with a frozen pizza, dense, overly chewy and flavorless.  The sauce had that overcooked, right out of a can flavor.  The greasy cheese and pepperoni followed the exceedingly mediocre theme to a T.  To make matters worse, my wife's slice came out warm at best, so she had to have the kitchen put it in the oven to warm it up. 

The Italian Beef sandwich had little going for it in the flavor department, whether it be the spongy bread, the melted slab of chewy mozzarella cheese or the watery ju that accompanied the sandwich.  I appreciated the generous serving of beef, but man oh man, I'd trade less beef for more flavor.  The crinkle-cut fries came out warm and limp.

Service at the front counter was pleasant and efficient.  The person at the counter cheerfully greeted us as we entered the restaurant and granted our request for a side of feta cheese to go with my daughter slice of cheese pizza.  With a variety of lunch specials, you do not need to spend a fortune on your lunch here.  

The dining room could serve as a set for Goodfellas, with the Italian music wafting over the speakers, the red and white checked (plastic) tablecloths, elevated private booths and a minimal amount of sunlight filtering in though a small window.    The two big screens TVs detracted from the ambiance, but I did appreciate being able check the score of the World Cup match taking place that day.

If you are looking for cheap and filling, this is your place.  If you are looking for delicious, keep driving past this strip mall outpost."}
{"text":"We can work long hours at my office, and there are lots of nights where we are hungry and cranky and need food NOW. Our Champaign native suggested Rosati's and we've ordered from there a few times. I really like the freshness of the ingredients, though there often is a bit too much cheese for me. The sauce is nice and thick and garlicky which I loved as well. Sadly, Rosati's is really expensive for Champaign, which makes it difficult to order often for us poor grad students, but it is really good. I'd almost hazard to say it's better than Papadel's. Blasphemy, I know."}
{"text":"If Rosati's delivered to my house, it would be the only pizza I'd ordered. It's amazing. The thin crust itself is above average and always tasty, but the chicago style is nothing short of amazing. All of their options look tantalizing. The 'double dough' (whatever that is), or the stuffed crust, which just two layers of dough with a sheet of cheese in between.

Speaking of cheese, they use great mozzarella. And they don't skimp on it, either. The sauce is robust, and I am often pleased at finding chunks of delicious tomatoes throughout. I honestly can't think of anything I'd change about this pie. 

But that's not all. There are many items on this menu, almost TOO many. You can order sandwiches, calamari, and even *gasp* ribs. Seriously. There needs to be a sixth star for such overkill.

I know Yelpers in Phoenix are all about the thin crust gourmet, but if you're in the mood for something that sticks to your ribs, make Rosati's your next stop. You'll have no regrets.

Take the Taric Challenge¬ô and finish half a large Chicago in one day. It's a lot harder than it sounds."}
{"text":"Just ordered pizza and pasta online.  Easy to order, food was delivered in a timely fashion. Pasta was excellent.  Glad there are more options in this neighborhood beyond the usual corporate pizza mongers.  I shall return."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely stellar. Had a great time Friday night in the dining room area with friends and family. Staff were very lovely with how they dealt with service. Kudos to them. Pizza tasted perfect and wings were great! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered half trays of lasagna, chicken marsala and ravioli last night. Price is good for the size, delivery was on time, staff on the phone offered plates, parmesan cheese and chili flakes--didn't receive any but got plenty of forks (like 30) and a good stack of napkins. 3 trays of pasta came with a tray of bread sticks, SO SO GOOD! Best dish was the lasagna, for the chicken marsala, the sauce, mushroom, and pasta were excellent but only came with 4 small piece of very dry chicken. Glad they didn't include more chicken jerky.....Ravioli was fresh, but not a big fan of the pomodoro sauce. Because of the best lasagna I've ever had, I am giving 4 instead of 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came for the spaghetti special. It literally took me 45 minutes to get it and I sat and watched a total of three other tables come in, get served and actually leave
Nobody checked on me and I actually had to go and ask what was going on with my spaghetti that typically takes six minutes to make and since it was the special I figured they had it prepared.  

The pizza is just OK. it's very expensive but one thing that's consistent is the service is typically slow and the staff is not very attentive.  Unfortunately, the reason that we go there is because it's nearby no other option and I think they know that."}
{"text":"Well this is the second time I've written about this place. I still have to say it's just not that good. I ordered pizza, wings, and cheese sticks today. Cheese sticks you can't really mess up, and the wings were pretty good, I got the chipotle bbq. The pizza on the other hand, well the toppings were good, I got the bbq chicken, but the crust was just plain bad. It tasted like some cheap premade crust you buy at safeway or something. I also tried a burger from there not too long ago which I would give a 3/10....All in all I don't think I'll be ordering from this place again, I've given it 3 chances and they gotten 3 strikes...in my book that means you're done."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. We had pizza, ribs, and fried chicken. We are in town for an event and found them on Restaurant.com. Our server Melissa was awesome. Very friendly and attentive. I hope to come back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stop at Rosati's on Thomas Road fairly often. Last weekend we ordered our usual pizzas and sat in our usual booth to wait. After about 20 minutes it became clear that our order had fallen through the cracks, so we inquired and were told that the food would be right out. Well, they screwed up the order, took too long, and gave us the wrong pizza. When we pointed this out to the manager, she was very polite and worked very hard to rectify the mistake to our satisfaction. 

It's one thing to make a mistake, but it's quite another to fix that mistake and take care of your customers like Rosati's did in our case. Sure, we lost a few minutes, but the staff worked very hard to make sure that the problem was fixed. This was the first time we'd ever had a problem at Rosati's, and they made certain everything was okay. I know lots of people like to complain, but this Rosati's location did fine by us, and we'll be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Well, as with all good things, they come to an end.  This place has lost my business forever.  I am tired of the over prices, under cooked dough but today was the end....  I ordered a pizza over the phone.  If was a double crust pizza. Traditionally it takes about 25 mins... well.. this time was considerably longer as I sat and waited. I watched as there were so many staff on hand they were chatting on the phone, sitting around (delivery people 5 deep with no orders), other staff members laughing and joking.  Finally my pizza was up.  I watched as the baker was cutting and noticed that he was cutting into squares.  I hate squares and with extra sauce I ordered, everything slides off the crust.  This was always the case for thin crust, but not double.  Apparently there was a change and I was not told.  I explained this was not normal, but they replied that is how it is now.  Not caring to offer a discount on a further order or reducing the price, they were forced to refund my money.  You know, there are many other places with good pizza, I will not have to look hard.  I drove out of my way for this particular place, but no more.  Good Bye.  Suggest anyone looking for a good business, good product, courteous staff, and good price - LOOK ELSEWHERE.  This is NOT the place for that!"}
{"text":"We placed an order for several hotdogs and one sausage for delivery (we are a local business located VERY near this restaurant).  After waiting 1 1/2 hours, our food FINALLY arrived.  It was clear it had been sitting for at least an hour or more after being prepared.  ALL of it was cold.  All of the buns were so soggy it made all of the hotdogs and sausage INEDIBLE.  Coldest french frys ever.  We called the restaurant (09/06/12 1:00 pm) and it was clear that the person who had took our order didn't care AT ALL.  They've lost our business for good."}
{"text":"I give them a 4 out of 5 stars because 1 they were super fast and my food was hot lol.
Also because we got a order of free bread sticks that you can redeem by checking in , not to mention that their pretty amazing 
The pizza was a little to cheesy for me. I asked for a pepperoni not cheese & it literally all slid off as I grabbed it. Defiantly disappointed about that, but other than that it was really good especially their wings! Super juicy , meat so tender it falls off the bone. 
Defiantly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service. When we ordered a deep dish pizza they said it takes 45 minutes to cook there for delivery would be in about an hour. The pizza was to us in 40 minutes and as you can guess it was most certainly undercooked. Horrible kitchen staff"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from this place for the first time and it was amazing! Food got to my house super quick and the driver had a great attitude and was really cool! Was nice to bring cheese and peppers! Ask for the drivers name and it was Dakota. Will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"This pizza place has a lot of good things going for it! My work recently catered in lunch and I was able to sample some of their thin crust pizza offerings. 

My initial thought was \"this is not thin crust\" - but when I think thin, I think cracker thin. That being said a cracker crust would never hold-up to the glorious amount of stretchy cheese and toppings that are present in every bite - so gooey! 

The establishment remains true to its claim of authentic \"Chicago\" style with hand-crafted Italian sausage present on many items. I tried the Godfather and I really like the addition of giardiniera and this was far and away my favorite specialty pizza. The sauce was good - not too sweet - and portioned out mildly enough not to over power the bite.

Overall it's good pizza and worth the extra couple of dollars for something far more substantial then your average chain!"}
{"text":"New owners make all the difference!

I used to live over on Oak and 64th street, so my Rosati's location was on Thomas and 40th St. I always thought the best Chicago style deep dish pizza came out of their kitchen. I've had Lou Malnati's and Gino's East while in Chicago, and I felt like this place was better. 

I was pretty disappointed when I moved to Roosevelt and Granite Reef and discovered the nearest Rosati's had bad reviews. I ordered anyway, and was just as let down as reviews would have me expect to be. It wasn't just sub-par, it was almost inedible. So for the last 2 years, I haven't ordered Rosati's delivery (though I have gone across town to the Thomas location to pick up a few times). I've really missed it.

I was excited when I recently found out this location was getting new ownership. Nothing against the previous owner, but I just don't think their heart was quite in it. Anyway, tonight I picked up a 16\" Chicago deep dish. It was perfect! Fucking magical! Absolutely delicious! 

As I sit here filled with cheese and dough and meat and tomatoes and sauce, I contemplate the universe and both appreciate and lament the alignment of the stars to provide me with such a close proximity to a quality Rosati's again. Appreciate for obvious reasons, and lament because this is going to be trouble for my waistline. 

Talked to the owner over the phone - he seemed super nice and enthusiastic. I mean - he gives a shit. That alone means you're going to enjoy the food more. He claims to make the best wings in the Valley... challenge accepted. I recommend trying them again if you haven't in awhile. Also - seems like the prices have come down a bit. 

We're regulars startiiiiiiiing... NOW."}
{"text":"May 2014 - I've been eating Rosati's for years now, and I'm a huge fan. I realize now that I was spoiled by this location. I also realize I've been giving away 5 star reviews more liberally the last few years and back when I reviewed this as a 4, I was a lot tougher of a critic on places. Since I wrote the original review below, I have been to Chicago and have eaten at all of the famous deep dish places, and this Rosati's beats em. I'm not kidding. 

Now the owner of this location has been here for years now, and he has done a fantastic job of staying consistent and awesome. I heard that new franchise owners go here to train. Not all Rosati's are created equal. Some are not up to par, but this location is the gold standard as far as I'm concerned. 

Even though I moved out of range for this location, the one near my house was not that great - so when I got the craving, I would go miles out of my way to get pizza here. Perfect every single time. I've now moved again and am even further away - the Rosati's near my house is from the Corporate side, and is also really solid so I may not go as far out of my way as often anymore, but I still will occasionally. 

Think of it this way - Rosati's prices aren't cheap, and most locations don't really have a sit-down experience that the food really deserves. This means to me that the ingredients quality is high. At locations where they stick with the program, it definitely is. This is one of them. Again - in my opinion, this is the gold standard for this franchise. 

I'm upping it to 5 stars - and these are well deserved. I'm only sorry that I let this location sit at 4 stars for so long. 

3/22/2009 - Rosati's is under new ownership. Apparently, it was going downhill fast under the previous owner near the end. Now it seems to have been rescued and revamped. 

I haven't been inside, but I did order some delivery yesterday. I got a 12\" Chicago style pizza... it was pretty damn good. It was a little spendy, but I'd say it was worth it. It fed me for two days. The pizza arrived hot, and the box it came in was actually pretty fancy for a pizza box. 

Their menu is pretty nice. I spoke with the owner when I called to order and he told me about what he's been doing. He's definitely trying to raise the bar and elevate this place to another level. I think he said he bought a few other spots as well. 

Since it's a little more pricey than Mama Mia's, I don't know how often I'll order from here, but it's a nice alternative. If you're a fan of Chicago pizza - this seems to be a solid place to get it.

I'll update this review after I've eaten here a few more times.

Edit: Okay, after eating here a few times, I'll say that I love their toppings, but the bread they use sucks. The pasta isn't terribly amazing either. It's good though. The delivery is fast and it arrives really hot and fresh. I'm still keeping it at 4 stars."}
{"text":"So excited that this opened up near my office. We go at least once a week. The lunch specials are so inexpensive and yummy. Best ranch dressing in Las Vegas. Judd and Jen are our favorite servers. They remember my order and phone number for reward points."}
{"text":"Freakin delicious! Love the fried ravioli, thin crust pizza so good me and my girls were eating like they were potato chips! Got here faster than expected (always a plus!) and delivery guy super friendly!! A new favorite !!"}
{"text":"Their deep dish \"Chicago style\" is certainly not. It's like Pan crust from Pizza Hut. Strongly advise against it."}
{"text":"I order from here for my work whenever we have customer appreciation days or lunch meetings, and the pizzas are always a hit.  I get lots of people wanting to know which restaurant the pizza came from.  They are also very fast and helpful on the phone.  I've never eaten in the restaurant, but as far as delivery goes these guys are topnotch."}
{"text":"I ordered an 18\" pizza, 10\" pizza and an order of 12 wings the total came to $79.99.  I have a feeling they were flying the pizza in from Chicago.  Decent pizza but overpriced, I'll stick to Oregano's."}
{"text":"just got a call that i have to pay $4 more for delivery because i am out of their delivery  order  they are less than a mile from me. you notice my use of upper case outrageous. never again will i order from them."}
{"text":"Once again a big thank you to Rosatis at 2235 s. Power rd #118 mesa! Great price! Slamin food! Delivered fast on a way busy night! Delivery guy was highly professional,  very friendly, and way better at quick math than Me! Haha. I know you are all working hard to make a great product and you are! Your food Rocks! Thanks for another awesome dinner!! I will certainly eat here again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting the best pizza that I have had here in AZ."}
{"text":"If you like thick deep dish style pie it is hard to find any better around Phoenix.  That doesn't make it great however, far from it.  The crust is tasteless cardboard.  The sauce and ingredients try to cover up the crusts flaws but don't totally do it.  Prices are what you would expect for a deep dish pie on the high side"}
{"text":"Probably the closest you will get to Chicago Pizza its good 
Their Italian cheesy Beef is great too"}
{"text":"This is the second time I came in and I'm so surprised by how the staff was. Last time I got a half and half pizza. And it was amazing. Today they don't make it at all. Their menu apparently changes depending on the flow of the place. Although on their menu it says \" u dream it we build it\". I guess not. First  time I went it was Amazing!!! Delish!!!! We love the pizza. Pricey but oh so yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza that I have ordered several times.  The pizza was horrible.  The service was lousy.  Requested a refund, the one who called herself a manager said she could not refund the money because she said she made the pizza perfectly.  huhhhh,  Then we asked what we should do with the pizza and her response was, \"I really don't care what you do with the pizza.  You can throw it away for all I care.\" Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Rude and Poor Service!  Negative comments spread quickly and will continue to do so.  Rude."}
{"text":"Saturday night pizza craving + my calorie-based diet cheat day + a little drinking = ordering way too much delivery food than I should have.

I didn't feel like getting a Papa John's or Pizza Hut-esque pie despite how cheap they are, so I checked out Rosati's website for coupons and what kind of 'za I could get for myself.

I settled on a 12'' half cheese and half pepperoni/sausage with the \"double dough\" crust, plus a half pound of boneless wings, and a coupon for free delivery. Yes, this was way too much grub for 1 sane person, but I was hungry and had leftovers for the next day.

Delivery took a very long and hunger-stricken hour and 15 minutes from the time of order, which even for a Saturday seemed a bit long, especially considering the place is less than a mile from my place. I probably should have just walked there and picked it up.....

The pizza wasn't bad! It is really thick though and I was wishing I would have gotten the classic thin crust (oops!). Thick cheese on the other hand, is always good in my book! But I felt that there could have been more sauce, too. As you can tell from the picture, Rosati's puts the toppings underneath the cheese, which is honestly kind of a pet peeve of mine because you can't really tell how much meat is on there, or where it is on the pizza in some cases! Either way, not bad compared to Domino's/Papa John's whose \"meats\" are of questionable substance and taste. Overall not a bad pie but probably not the best or my favorite on campus, either.

Strangely enough, I actually really enjoyed the boneless wings! Who would have thought that a decent place to get wings on campus was Rosati's? Not me! They come by the weight and I ordered 1/2 pound which was about 5 giant boneless wings. I got them with the chipotle sauce which was flavorful and adequately spicy. A lot of pizza place wings can be really dry on the inside and be the size of Ping-Pong balls, but these were pretty moist, had a nice breading on them and were nearly the size of billiard balls! I would order these again!

What really made this only a 3/5 experience was the price. Rosati's is comparably expensive to some of the local pizza spots, my whole order was ~$21 including free delivery but excluding tip. Most of the coupons on the website don't give you more than $1 or $2 off, so this was without question a pricey pie and wings night."}
{"text":"We have been ordering pick up from Rosati's for years. When they moved to Warm Springs and Eastern and now converted to a sit down restaurant, we were thrilled.
We went there this evening to enjoy a good meal, unfortunately, that was not the case!
When we walked in, we were unsure whether we had to wait to be seated or could just seat ourselves and there was no sign posted on what we should do. We stood at the front counter for quite a while. We could see into the kitchen, where there were 3 guys standing and talking to each other, totally ignoring us! Finally, a girl came out from the back and asked if we had been helped. We told her we wanted to sit down and eat and she said to just go sit anywhere. We sat down and waited for 15 minutes for someone to come by, give us menus, silverware and ask us if we'd like a beverage. We decided to wait 5 more minutes before we'd get up and leave. 5 minutes passed, nobody ever approached our table, so we got up to leave. As we reached the front door, there were 2 girls behind the counter talking. As we were walking out, one girl said \"good night, thank you!\". I said \"thanks for what? We never ate!\". We continued out the door and as I turned to take one last look at the girl who spoke to us, she and the other girl were laughing!
Rosati's, you would be better off firing your current employees and going back to being a strictly take out and delivery restaurant!
Do not even think about eating in there!"}
{"text":"So this is my second time ordering from Rosati's.  I order online through GrubHub.com. The food was okay last time and my kids enjoyed it.  I just didn't understand why it cost of $50.  Also, the driver was late because the print out of my address was wrong.
Fast forward to tonight, and my order was supposed to be delivered between 7:30 and 7:40.  It's now 7:45.  I had a snack earlier since I knew I was eating late but the hunger pains are hitting hard.
Anywho, we ordered the Chicago Style pizza, a brownie, calzone, and chicken parm sandwich....to the tune of $70!  I'm trying to give them a break but seriously!  This is expensive!
As of right now, it is 8:21. Still no food.  Driver says my address printed wrong but as I'm sitting here looking at my computer screen and my address is staring right back at me. 
8:30- I am currently in a chat with Sarah F. at GrubHub.com.  Trying to figure out a refund so I can get some Taco Bell and salvage at least part of movie night with my kids.
8:38- Food arrived.  Delivery kid was super apologetic, but it's not his fault that I now have Taco Bell and Rosati's.  I am demanding a refund.  If I wanted to turn my oven on, I would have cooked myself.

Update:
After reheating my food for 15 minutes in the oven, the deep dish pizza and calzone were only warm in the middle.  After much thought and consideration I am only giving them one star because it seems like they are willing to sacrifice quality in order to get more people to order.  If it did not cost $68 and some change for last nights meal, I would not be as upset as a customer.  But in my mind, I paid close to $100 for food for my family's movie night and received lukewarm crap that I had to reheat because this restaurant couldn't get it together.  It's not worth the price OR the headache."}
{"text":"This was not good pizza.   Topings were good that's where the 2 stars go.   Pizza dough was like soft cardboard.   We got the meat mania.  Also got cheese garlic bread...   I could have made this with French bread with butter and melted mozzarella cheese ...   Got their garlic doughnuts..  This was a copy of Olive Garden's dessert that French doughnut with Hersey chocolate syrup..   Nice delivery service the guy was really nice...   But dont think we'll ever go back."}
{"text":"We have been buying pizza from this locations since it opened. I always pick it up since i'm close. We get the family size thin combo and it has always been great.

Don't care what the area to pay looks like. The location is not a dine and meant for delivery or pick up only.

Staff has always been super nice.

Granted, it's expensive pizza and we don't eat it a lot, but when we want to eat really good pizza, then Rosati's it is."}
{"text":"This place not only has delicious pizza, but the owner and staff are some of the best you'll meet. We are in Scottsdale for a horse show, and I tried to order pizza delivery at 11pm on a Thursday after a very, very long work day. All I could think about was how excited I was to have some of their amazing pizza. I didn't remember that their kitchen closes at 10pm during the week, but when the owner heard about my intense disappointment over no pizza, he called me back and offered to make and deliver pizza to our hungry group. I'm a life long customer anyway because of their food, but now I'll double my efforts to tell everyone I know how fabulous they are. You don't find customer service like this very often anymore; it's just icing that their pizza is so fabulous."}
{"text":"The food is good, not excellent.  Stay away feom getting your food delivered, you will wait 1.5 hours and every time they will forget at least half your order. If the kitchen is this understaffed,  hire more people. I will NEVER order from here again because the last 3 times the service was late, they forgot half the order and its just not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is okay.. the food is decent and the couple times I've been here the staff was pretty nice and attentive but it does get busy in here.. so if u want to come before the rush it isn't bad.. this isn't the first place I'll recommend to ppl for pizza or pasta because I do have a couple other favorite places I like going too.. the couple times I've been here has mainly because my boyfriends dad likes coming here because it's literally a two minute drive from his house.. he is the main person that likes coming here because it's close and he doesn't like venturing out to other places away from his house .."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food, service, and atmosphere. Been here in the past and today was the first time I've been here in awhile. Once again, no disappointments! We got the Chicago style 14 inch and it was cooked perfectly! Not too much sauce. Perfect amount of cheese. Crust was a little more cooked than normal, but I think that was to ensure it could sustain the sauces on top of the crust. Left a happy customer!"}
{"text":"Believe the low ratings expensive and disappointing!  Long wait and cold food. Never again for me try rino d's they are always consistent."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try today. Delivery was on time if not a little early. Order was correct and driver even explained our extra sauces were in the box. Pizza was hot and delicious. I recommend the ground hamburger. It has some pork in it, which they made sure to mention on the phone and is really good. 
Some of the other reviews are suspect but I highly recommend the thin crust pizza and cheesy garlic bread."}
{"text":"I have only ordered the pizza, both the chicago style deep dish (woah, I could only eat a piece and a half!) and the thin crust.  Each Rosatis in my experience is different.  I used to love the one in Gilbert, hated the one on Shea and and 116th area, and finally after a slew of late night dominos orders remembered to try this location in Arcadia.  I was not disappointed, they do a great job, and I love that they deliver late night which is usually just when a massive pizza craving strikes!"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent and wings are nice & spicy!!!!! Ordered for delivery and they came in less than the 1 hour timeframe given.  Service here is always good whether we get delivery or pick up.  The menu choices are excellent as well with several different pizzas to choose from.  A definite returning customer."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The way the staff is treated here is crazy. They abuse employees, embarrass them in front of guest. That's so rude and bad for business. I will take my hard earned money somewhere else. I will not support the owners and how they treat there employees..."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim, and boy was my family let down. This pizza, if you can call a thin piece of paper with burnt cheese on top, \"pizza\" was extremely flavorless. It was $22 and even my children who love all pizza (including Dominos and little Caesars) hated it. The pepperoni had the texture of a checker. The cheese was scarce in sections and too much in others instead of being even throughout. My mother-in-law made a comment about the size and the manager curtly responded to her that \"everyone loves me\" in a not so humble bragging manner. 
If you decide that you want bad pizza, you should save your money, and buy a frozen pizza. Then proceed to eat it without cooking it in the oven. This way you will only waste $8 instead of an evening. 
If only there was a 0 star review..."}
{"text":"(Late Review) Outstanding Customer Service, Prompt Delivery, guy who delivered was absolutely awesome. We go to this specific Rosati's regularly and are never let down."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Vegas!  There's great service every time I've been there.  They'll even offer a free drink while you wait for your pick-up order if it takes a few more minutes.  It's those simple little things that keeps customers coming back.... highly recommend!  :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Rosatis for coming out here..  Now i dont have to drive 20 miles for good pizza.  The thin crust pepperoni classic is delicious!!  Before they came out here,  i tried to go to pizza hut and as Barkley tells it,,  Just terrrrible...  R & R is ok and we all know about dominos...  FYI,,  go on Fridays,,  they double the coupons so you can order a good sized pizza and some wings for under 10$ if you use the 5 dollar coupon."}
{"text":"Great food and decent service. It was the first time we tried Chicago style pizza and we loved it! However we gave it 4 stars because our pizza was lukewarm. Since they are made to order and it wasn't crowded we thought it would be hot."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the super bowl and the appetizer combination platter was great! Everything was home made and tasted incredible. The pizza was great too!"}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes after I called the order in before it was ready. Two pizzas were over $50.  When we got it home one pizza was barely warm and the other had ingredients which we specifically asked to be left off.  But the real problem was that the Chicago style pizza was inedible because the dough inside was raw."}
{"text":"Their pizza is to DIE for. My parents have been ordering from here for some time, and every time I'm back in town, we order from here. They love it, and so do I! The thin crust pizza is all I've tried but the first time was enough to know that I was in love. We get italian sausage & green peppers and it is just phenomenal. HIGHLY recommended if you are looking for one of the best thin crust pizzas your mouth will ever meet."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. They put the toppings under the cheese and just the right amount of sauce. This is my go to pizza place. Thy have happy hour from 3-6 and you can dine in or our. I'm not sure if they deliver, but I definitely recommend coming in!"}
{"text":"Love the service, thin crust pizza is great with a perfect amount of sauce. Prices are reasonable for the area. They have good hours. You can pick up, have it delivered, or enjoy your dinner there in a friendly atmosphere with your friends. Good job Rosati's, giving locals a great place to grab a bite from an amazing menu. 8^)"}
{"text":"When you walk in the restaurant just smells bad. And the pizza tasted like the restaurant smells. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Only two reviews well over a year old?  Seriously?  C'mon people!  Rosati's is pretty darn good!!  And they deliver!!  I was introduced to Rosati's at their store on Thomas in Central Phoenix.  They had a good variety of menu items, appitizers, ribs, fish and chips, fried shrimp, salad, sandwiches and pizza and pasta.  Then when my daughter and I stayed at a local hotel and didn't feel like going out, their store in Awhatukee delivered right to our hotel room door! Their pasta is always cooked to perfection.....my daughter loves her spaghetti with butter.  They give you a generous hunk of garlic bread with it.  I love pizza.....and this pizza was unique to me the first time I had it.  A thin crust, cut in squares, with the toppings covered by a layer of cheese.  YUM!  Apparently this is another type of Chicago style pizza.  Their toppins are quality!  The sausage is delicious!!  It's got the right amount of spices and that gives it a nice flavor.  So tonight I decided to try something a little different.  I ordered their \"double dough\" pizza.  It's a thicker crust but not a super thick crust.  The edges are thicker than the regular pizza they serve.  This was the BOMB DIGGITY!  I had sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and roasted red peppers and that was an awesome combination.  I also had the freshest ceaser salad I have had in a while.  Friday night is pizza night at our house and this one will be in the rotation for sure!  It's also nice to know they have been in business here for a while.  I'm all about supporting the local businesses and putting back into the economy when I can.  So come on people......try Rosati's!!!"}
{"text":"The toppings, sauce and cheese were all very good on my pizza. However, the crust left a lot to be desired. No flavor, hard and dry. Like a day old loaf of italian bread.  
The place was listed in Entertainment Guide with a coupon. When I called to place an order (for pick up, as they had no delivery drivers) I was told that they are NOT honoring that coupon.  Really?  Service was ok. Not rude, but not overly accommodating."}
{"text":"Until I get a return call from a manager I cannot give more than 1 star. I have coming to Rosati's awhile since I moved into the neighborhood a few years back. I typically do pick up because I've noticed deliveries are usually a mess. Even when doing pick up I ALWAYS have to remind them of things - \"I paid for an extra ranch\" (which is a must if more than 1 person is eating), \"I ordered a bottle of soda\", \"The person on the phone said 45 min and I've been waiting an extra 1/2 hour over that amount of time... just sitting here\". 

It's walking distance from my house but since the weather was crappy I decided to have them deliver so I wouldn't have to leave the house. Even more disastrous than the pick up issues. The order was wrong and cold... I mentioned I live walking distance? Literally a 3 minute drive away - no idea how food could possible get cold that fast. I called and asked them to return with the part of my order they forgot - they said it would be another 30 minutes along with a laugh at my frustration (more than once). I asked if it would be that long that they just return with my money and I'd give them the food back. 

I asked to speak to a manager - they gave an over-explanation of how the owner went home with family health issues. After asking that a manager call me when back in the girl (Valerie) magically changed her mind and decided it would be only 15 minutes (still ridiculous). 

20 minutes later they called me back to let me know they didn't have my address, and 10 minutes after that I finally had my complete cold, mediocre meal. With a rude 2nd delivery on top of all that. After the phone argument I don't even trust to eat it.

Don't go here. The pizza is only okay and by the time you even get your food you could make your own pizza from scratch. 

You'll notice they never reply to negative reviews on here - it's because they have no excuses for the bad customer service and they have no intention of fixing it."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago and enjoyed many a Pizza in my days there. Since I left it was a struggle finding something as good. Well this chain is a truly great Pizza. And I would give them a try"}
{"text":"3 Stars for inconsistency and a horrible staff.

I had Rosatis a few times from one of their other locations before I moved to this area and never had a bad experience. I now live right across the street from this one and have ordered  a number of times. Some times its great, sometimes its ok and sometimes its just plain sad. The management for Rosatis really needs to evaluate this location and figure out what or should I say who is to blame. Every time I go in here the staff seems confused and frustrated and to be honest I don't think they were trained properly or know what they are doing. I have been 5 or 6 times now and I don't think I have seen the same employee twice (meaning they can't hold on to employees). 

I considered applying here when I first found them but then decided against it after seeing the employees and people I would have to work with. They all seemed just miserable all the time.
For one- when I call and place the order they usually seem confused. I always do pick-up b/c its close by and after I place my order they usually just give me the total and are ready to hang up. I always have to ask how long before its ready. Am I supposed to just assume how long its going to take? I have never ordered food and not gotten a time. Then they usually just guess when I tell them because the person working the phones has no idea how long it takes for stuff to cook.
Which means- when I get there usually either my food has not even gone in yet (happened once) or my food is nowhere close to being ready (happened twice). I have also witnessed my food being packed up and put in the warmer by the cooks and the girl at the front was not notified that an order was complete. I had to go to her and tell her that my food had just come out. (pathetic)
I even came in one night to find out that they had \"given my food to the wrong person apparently\" which I think is BS and they just forgot to do it. So I stood there waiting for it for about 20 minutes and they didn't even give me a discount or anything.
Recently they have had the Lunch buffet for 5.99 from 11-2pm m-f. The first time i tried to go was around 1 on a wed and the guy at the front when I asked if they were doing the buffet said he didn't know if they were doing it and that he was just covering for someone. How do you not know if you are doing a buffet?! So I left. Decided to try again last wed at 1pm and the girl had to ask the cook if it was still going on. I almost walked out again but she said it was so I decided to try it. Not impressive AT ALL!!!! The food had been sitting out forever. The pizza was cold, the pasta was dried up. The sauce and meatballs were good as well as the salad and the anti-pasto. However, I had to go looking around for parmesean cheese when the server dissappeared for a while (leaving 2 or 3 dirty tables out while she was away). I felt bad because she was very friendly and sweet but had no idea what she was doing.

Luckily for this Rosatis there food is still good, however as I mentioned... inconsistent. But it is the closest decent food for me without having to drive far. Just last night I ordered the Rosatis Chopped Salad (might be the best salad I have ever had, honestly) and I ordered The Cheef (there version of a cheesesteak. The Cheef was rather disappointing as the meat was not prepared right and was too greasy causing the nicely toasted bread to become moist at the bottom and tear apart to create a messy sandwich.

If anyone from Rosati's reads this: Please get a new staff! Your manager at this location obviously is clueless as to what they are doing and lets the staff do whatever they like. This has the potential to be such a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I've called two days in a row, gotten put on hold and never returned to:(. I think 7 mins on hold is unacceptable.  In other news...it's not as good as the one on Cheyenne.  Their portions are smaller and CS is poor.  There is no incentive club online like the Cheyenne one either.  Won't be back, will stick w Rocco's!  Love Rocco's, never had a problem there!!"}
{"text":"I had the TERRIBLE pleasure of dealing with Scottie who is, apparently, the owner of Rosati's. I was hoping to make right of a wrong order delivery but in the end he hung up on me.

I ordered a fettuccine alfredo with no chicken because the person it was intended for has an allergy. The gentleman who took my order asked me what kind of dressing I'd like with the salad and then repeated my entire order to make sure it was correct.

When the food arrived, there was chicken in the alfredo and there was no salad. The delivery guy knew the salad was left back so he said he'd credit my account for next time. When I noticed the pasta had chicken, I called back to the store because I wanted a refund. We had plans that night and would not have time to wait another hour for a new delivery. Scottie said, \"well anyone can just call back asking for a refund with the full intention of eating the pasta anyway\" as if accusing me of this. So he told me he needs the pasta back in order for him to give a refund. I told him he can come pick it up but we will not be waiting, we will leave it outside the door. He said no, I have to be there to hand it to the delivery guy! ITS GOING TO BE THROWN AWAY ANYWAY. So not only did Rosati's inconvenience our dinner plans, but now we should reschedule our evening out because Rosati's needs to trash a plate of food they made wrong in the first place? NO THANKS. 

Scottie was extremely rude about this entire situation and said that he can either credit my account for a pasta in the future or pick up my plate and give me the refund. I told him his unprofessionalism as the OWNER of the restaurant made me never want to eat there again so I had no interest in ordering in the future. He finally said that this phone call was going nowhere, he would credit my account, and said he'd hang up on me....which he did. 

Oddly enough, I called another Rosati's location and their manager said franchise owners aren't usually at the stores this late, or very often to begin with, which I agreed. She was not familiar with an owner named Scottie and said I probably just spoke to a manager. Who knew a MISTAKE on their end could cause such a ruckus! From the looks of many other reviews, I am not alone in delivery mistakes. But I will most definitely be speaking to dear Scottie's bosses because he needs a new job at the DMV."}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality is that this place is open late at night. The pizza is simply not good. The base reminds me of a frozen pizza crust and not nearly crispy enough for a thin crust pizza. This place is also crazy expensive. I paid $21 for a small one topping pizza and cheesy garlic bread. Unreal! There's definitely better pizza out there. If you're looking for good pizza, I'd say save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Another excellent experience! Pleasant greeter on the phone. Redeemed coupon found on line for FREE order of wings, breadsticks, and 2 liter, with any 18\" pie. Loaded with meat, piled thick with cheese, excellent sauce base, crust perfectly crispy on the bottom. This place delivers up very substantial pizzas. No skimping here! You will get your money's worth of food, and then some! Well done Rosati's on Thomas! 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Chicago Deep Dish,,, the pizza here is the best in N Las Vegas... The staff however, bunch of idiots, not friendly at all considering the price their pizza is...  If you want a decent Chicago Style this is the place in NLV,, the other crust options are ok as well... If not for the unfriendly customer service i would order from here more often.... The search for a Great Pizza in Las Vegas continues...."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant, hoping to have a nice Italian meal, or a pizza.  We walked in the front door, and stood right next to the sign that said, \"Please wait to be seated\".  OK. We waited.  Several employees passed us, back and forth, several times - no smiles, no acknowledgment, nothing. Finally, after 5 minutes a young lady, asks us \"Did you want to be seated?\"

Really.  \"Did you want to be seated?\"!!!!

\"Sure, thank you.\"  (although, my wife wanted to say...
\"No, we just wanted to stand here and look at your fine establishment.\")

She walked us to a table, dropped two menus on top, and walked away.  

Really!  I don't think so.  
Thank you very much, we'll go eat someplace else.  Never going back to Rosati's.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Favorite PIZZA EVER ... never let down when ordering and always fresh. Delivery is usually on time if not super quick on the made to order. Special note: if your looking for coupons they are only offered on the pizza box from last order no in house special offered only if you have a coupon..."}
{"text":"Visitor here.  Ordered pizza to go.  Took a while to get.  Back at the hotel, we popped it back in the oven.  Pretty good.  Good amount of toppings. Tons of cheese.  We are from the midwest.....a good pizza.  Seems like lots of regulars in the restaurant, food looked really good."}
{"text":"Update to my previous review. As seen on Yelp, the restaurant did contact me to follow up, the pizza was really good and I was pleased to be contacted for more information. Then tonight I received an email that really changed things. Apparently I had NOT ordered online directly to Rosati's but had been redirected thru an ordering site called \"Slice\".  Their website had been overwhelmed & orders were delayed to the restaurants. I am so happy! I have been searching for good food delivery in my area & I will definitely try again - BUT I will call next time!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza the best beer and the best service that I can ever imagine. If you come here get a slice and a beer with a side of marinara and you will love it I promise. They also have growlers of beer that you can take home and enjoy with your kids. I share my beer with my kids as often as I can it makes them sleepy. Haha just kidding I don't have kids. But I do love the beer."}
{"text":"I almost stopped ordering food from this location but since it has been under new ownership the food has been spectacular  especially the pizza. Keep up the good work. You guys are officially my favorite pizza place in Arizona.            From your favorite customers on E Villa Way"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Chicago style pizza this is the place to go! 
We used the order online function and had our pizza in less than an hour. 
We ordered the 20\" pizza - thin crust with pepperoni and sausage - it is huge!!!!
We also ordered a 16\" Hawaiian pizza - pan crust.  This was not my favorite type of pizza - thin is the way to go!  We ordered the 2 dozen wings - 1/2 BBQ and 1/2 Buffalo - they weren't the best wings ever, but good. 

We had 9 adults and 4 kids - and all the pizza and wings were gone!  

The delivery guy let me know that there was a closer location for future reference.  I really find that to be an awesome experience... typical restaurants would tell you to call the other location... I really appreciate that they made the order and delivered a few miles out of radius!  So great!"}
{"text":"Melanie had no idea how to accommodate food allergies order, to the point we cancelled the person with allergies order due to the incompetence and incoherent manager Melanie on the phone, she was completely clueless on how to accommodate someone with allergies order.

(If I was a owner I would want to be made aware (what I attempted to do by asking for owner info, was denied and refused the info)  and I'd also be highly concerned if my establishment couldn't figure out how to accommodate someone with allergies special specific order"}
{"text":"I used to work here, I also grew up on rosati's in the burbs of chicago. This place is legit. If you're complaining about wait times for delivery, maybe you need to realize there are times when there are 4 drivers and 20 deliveries on the board. Theres not even enough space in the oven sometimes to get everything in. If you really were so turned off by it, drive your happy ass in and pick it up.

On to the food, its always on point. I dont get anything special anymore but I used to get the monster and the combo pizza, now Im just a cheese and sausage guy. Doesnt matter what you choose though, its gonna be good. Even the kitchen food is good(sandwiches, pastas, chicken).You can always count on a good combo or italian beef sandwich.

Hope you'll overlook the critics who cant forgive human error and \"outrageous wait times\". If its gonna take an hour+ during dinner for delivery, doesnt that tell you they're busy because they're good? Take it from someone who worked here, these owners know what they're doing. You cant please everyone...

{"text":"i am very upset and disappointed in the customer service I received at the 4010 E Bell Rd in phoenix Arizona. I placed an order over the phone with Melissa. Prior to me ordering I informed her that I had a coupon and a gift certificate. I confirmed that both items could be used and she approved. I advised I had a family meal coupon which gave 2 large one topping pizza's, garlic bread, 12 wings and a liter of soda for 27.99. My gift certicate was for $25. Melissa was distracted during the whole conversation and kept repeating the order back wrong. She first gave me a total of approximately $45. I explained to her that that did not make sense when the family meal was 27.99 and the only thing additional I was getting was a large salad for 2.95. Again I read to her what was on the coupon that I received from the website and explained to her there is no way the total could be so high. After being place on hold for several minutes Melissa came back on the line and gave me a total of 36.83 which included tax and delivery. I said \"so the amount you will be charging on my card will be 11.83 correct\" and Melissa replied yes. When the delivery came I was charged 36.83 on the receipt I then called the location and Melissa asked how much i was charged and Melissa said 40.83 , there was now an additional $3 charge for delivery. I explained to her that my charge was only suppose to be 11.83 which I spoke to her about. She claims that she never knew about the gift certificate and would not reverse the charges. I think as a manager this is unacceptable. She was very distracted during the whole call and would not admit to her fault at all in this situation. I would not have approved the charge of 36.83 knowing that I had a 25 gift certificate."}
{"text":"Father's Day.  Ordered to go: 3 calzones, and with salad (enough for four people)

Back to the calzones:  Pathetic and not tasty at all.  My husband had Canadian bacon (bacon bits?), my son had ground beef, and my calzone was plain cheese with garlic. I couldn't taste any garlic, by the way.  There was hardly any cheese in any of them.
These were just about the worse calzones that we have ever had!!  The crusts was dry, not flavored. The calzones were sad, tasteless, and flat.  Mostly we were eating crust. Except for the salad, the calzones were a joke.  A Hot Pocket has more flavor...

We will not be returning!!

(*adding on.  You can see that whoever owns this business, really doesn't care!)."}
{"text":"Picked up a couple of calzones. They were delicious, full of flavor, and large enough to have half for lunch, half for dinner."}
{"text":"For years we have ordered from this Rosati's. Our favorite has been the pan pizza. We would have company over and order the pizza to treat people to a truly stellar deep dish pizza. My husband and I have been eating out less often for some time, and it had been about a year since we'd ordered Rosati's. Last night we felt like splurging and ordered a large pan pepperoni pizza. WHAT HAPPENED?! The pizza smelled different, and the ingredients are different. The dough was sad, soggy, and limp; not the usual crispy deliciousness. The cheese was not gooey at all, but rather salty and plastic-like. The dough screamed frozen, and we've had better Digiorno. Like our roommate said, \"It's not Digiorno, it's delivery.\" I don't review or comment on things unless my experience was really bad, or really good. In this case, it was BAD. The cost was the same, but the quality has gone way down. We will not order from Rosati's again. Next time, we'll just bake up a Digiorno."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from Rosetti's and spoke to Dan Fink. We were about to settle the differences of my undelivered food. The man that I heard on the backbone was racist and unkind and unprofessional. Do not ever order from this company. When I initially ordered the person who took my order did not put my phone number in correctly. During our unfortunate conversation the person in the background ruined it for everybody at that site. Do not order from these racist people."}
{"text":"The worst part about this location is it used to be amazing, then it was sold and promptly turned to crap. I complained once and the owner promised me two free burgers and then never delivered. This would have been my go-to place for march madness but not anymore. Ordering from Barros as we speak."}
{"text":"Rude, inconsiderate, hostile employees. 
Never will I step foot in this location again!"}
{"text":"I love love love their thin crust pizza, husband loves the deep dish. Biggest downfall is I always end up spending $50 on two pizzas which is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Rosati's is great- their menu offers a lot and their pizza is amazing! The new owners are very nice and I am always very satisfied when I order from them. I've been to the other Rosati's and this is by far the best one! Definitely will continue to come here for a long time!"}
{"text":"This location is the worst!! They wouldn't redeem a coupon I had in the \"Coupons For A Cure \" book that I had from a donation. Who says no to a coupon that is printed in black and white. Won't be back even though I live right there!"}
{"text":"I moved from Chicago 7 months ago and have endured my share of crappy pizza. Today I received a Rosati's mailer in my mailbox and ran home to show my husband. Pizza that I know, real Chicago pizza! Yes!!!!

So tonight I called and ordered because they don't have online ordering. My fingers trembled and misdialed twice. Finally they answered and I ordered a large Chicago style deep dish with a Greek salad and a cheese ravioli. An hour is too long to wait. My husband almost tackled the driver at the door and tipped him profusely. 

I began tearing packages of salad open while my husband dwaddled and signed his bill on the damn pizza box. Gosh man, can you be any slower? I ripped plates from the cupboard, found a spatula and a fork and knife. This is Chicago style pizza after all.

I finally wrangled the box and opened it, and sniffed. Oh F$&@ yeah! Between the tangy tomato sauce and gorgeous layers of cheese and fennel Italian sausage I tasted home. Ahhhhh...after I exhausted my pizza eating abilities I tried the Greek salad. Plenty of feta and kalamata olives with a lemony dressing. I'm a happy girl."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 large pizzas, two chiefs and 25 wings which came to $95 dollars. Ridiculously over priced and not worth even half that cost. The pizza hardly had any flavor. The cheese way overpowered the sauce. The chiefs were just okay but were delivered cold. The only thing that's earning this place is the wing sauce. Literally just the sauce. The medium sauce was delicious. The wings were riddled with fat and very veiny. I would of much rather went with one of the chains. I've have hotter better pizza from little caesars. Don't waste your money on this over priced pizza."}
{"text":"My science department has a tradition of coming here three times a year.  The first time is when we set up our rooms before our students start school, again at 1st semester finals, and finally at the end of the year.  It is hard to go wrong with an $8.59 (including tax) all you can eat pizza, salad, and fountain drink.  There is nothing like grading while trying to not pass out from a pizza food coma.

The buffet usually has two pizzas out at a time and is usually pepperoni or sausage.  If you have a non-meat eater you can request a veggie pizza and they will gladly accommodate you.  Not my top pick pizza in the world, but it is great for groups and such a reasonable price.  

The salad bar has iceberg lettuce with your usual toppings like cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, etc.  Some of their fun sides include macaroni salad, potato salad, and canned peaches.  They have a couple of different dressings and overall it is a way to trick yourself into thinking you are eating something healthy with your pizza.

Thank you Rosati's for always being there for local teachers.  I look forward to our next trip at the end of the year."}
{"text":"First Class Pizza. One of our favorite pizza places in the valley. Pickup and delivery only. Highly recommend the pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Mike from Rosati's sent me a message on yelp! the other day to make restitution.  I called him so we could resolve it directly, but he was out.  The next day I received a call from him and we discussed the circumstances of my last experience with Rosati's.  He apologized and told me that was not the way Rosati's does business.  I told him what I expected, and what I thought most people should expect from a restaurant was a replacement meal (in this case, the pizza) at no cost to the customer.

Mike agreed and left instructions at the restaurant for a future order.  Today we made that order for not one, but two pizzas.  We got one for free, but had to pay for the other, that was expected, but it would have been nice to have the entire order comped.

The driver arrived and apologized for being late.  He said \"sorry, they didn't call me\".  I asked if the pizzas were cold, he said, \"no, they were on the warmer\".  So they weren't cold, but they weren't fresh.  

I wanted to up my review to 5 stars.  I really did, but I think there is some room for improvement.  The pizza was later than they said, it was warm, but it wasn't fresh.  I was teetering between 3 and 4 stars.  I'm going to be generous and give a 4, because they did give us a free pie (it wasn't as fresh as I like, but it was free...)."}
{"text":"We had not had Rosati's in a few years and aren't sure why but we will again be having it frequently!!! So much better than most pizzas anywhere. The deep dish spinach, garlic, mushroom is incredible!  If you haven't had Rosati's, put it on your \"must try\" list and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The closing time on the door and on the internet said 10:00.  So I placed my order online, of course you have to pay with a credit card, and it said I could pick up my pizza at 10:01.  I went to the store, just down the road from me and when I got there at 9:59 pm, there was no one there.  So I had no pizza AND I was charged for a pizza.  When I called the next day, they said they close at 9:00.  When I asked them why there hours didn't reflect this both on their door and online, they stated that they hadn't changed it on the door but they couldn't explain why the computer let me place my order.  I like Chicago style pizza which is why I went there but, the service and their attitudes are HORRIBLE.  They have no idea what customer service is."}
{"text":"HUGE HUGE Pizza.  My wife and I got a Chicago-Style Pie for the two of us and we definitely over ordered.  Unless you plan on eating pizza for 3 days, I would get a small for just 2 people.  It felt like the box literally weighed 10 lbs...which I suppose isn't a bad thing because it meant they certainly didn't skimp on the toppings.  If you like Chicago-Style pizza you know how important the sauce on top of the pie is.  My wife who is Italian and who can be a picky eater really liked the sauce, and I couldn't disagree.

We ordered out so I can't comment on the actual location and service, but based on the quality of the food we got I would totally go back with a few friends to split some pizza and some other favorites on the menu."}
{"text":"I give Rosati's props for having the best, albeit greasiest, deep dish pizza in town.  I'd give them 4 stars but the pizza is SO heavy I often can only eat one piece without feeling a gut bomb the next morning."}
{"text":"Talk about crap everything. Try the pizza at Costco $10 pie cooked there much better. Yo Pizza help  what are you taking the cheese and the sauce home give some to the paying customers. The freaking heroes are tiny barely any cheese barely any sauce you don't even use authentic Italian bread and the bread that is used is soaking wet like a sponge. Shame on you shouldn't even use an Italian name. 

This place is way overrated I'm disgusted. It should be closed down.

WAIT THEY DID CLOSE DOWN. NOW CLOSE ALL THE OTHER ROSATI's IN NEVADA

UNLESS YOU LIKE MAKE BELIEVE ITALIAN BULLSHIT AND PRICES TO MATCH"}
{"text":"i really like rosati's pizza. i used to live in chicago and was always a fan of thin crust rosati's or lou malnatis. thick crust is a different story/different restaurant. the only problem i have with this place is maybe 1 or 2 of the cashiers just seem like they don't want to be there. i mean, if anyone is coming to pick up pizza and leaves a few bucks in the tip jar, at least have the common courtesy of saying \"thank you\"."}
{"text":"Happy Holidays to my fellow Arizonians and snowbirds.....

If you read any of my reviews you know by now I am the pickiest person I know and.... I detest spending good money on bad food.

So, here we go with Rosatis on Ray Rd in Chandlers review......

I am from Chicago and grew up eating Rosatis on Milwaukee Ave and know what their pizza SHOULD taste like..... now, I understand that everyone who advertises \"Chicago pizza\" here in Az forgets what REAL Chicago pizza tastes like and I have no idea why nobody can make an authentic Chicago type pizza...

I have eaten at a few different Rosatis locations over the years and this location is BY FAR THE WORST!

I ordered a pepperoni pizza and for some reason decided to get the double dough....not realizing this meant less cheese and pepperoni!

We got the pizza in a reasonable amount of time and it was cold!

The dough looked undercooked and was tasteless and although I ordered \"easy sauce\" they chose to put no sauce....or so it seemed.

I can only compare this pizza to one of cheap $5.99 pizza places!    Except my medium pepperoni pizza cost $17.00!

As I am sure you already know Rosatis is NOT a cheap pizza...they charge a higher price, which I would not mind paying if the pizza were good, but that is NOT the case!

Not only was the sauce scarce but there was hardly any cheese and like Dominoes or poppa johns they used the type of cheese that doesnt melt.....

How does cheese not melt you might ask?

Your guess is as good as mine unless it is imitation cheese which I am sure they do not use....or so I hope!

I really should have called them and told them their Pizza SUCKED, but I chose to just write my review and not go back again.

How is it possible that Rosatis can be so different from location to location when they use the same ingredients?

Anyway, I was really wanting pizza tonight and one slice of their so called pizza turned my stomach.

If anyone knows a good or even decent pizza place in Chandler area, please let me know.

I would have been better off with a store bought pizza.....

Ya live, ya learn!

So Rosatis.....I think its time for you to read the reviews about your location and make some changes, unless of course you just dont care in which case.....
Keep doing what you're doing!

My Suggestion to all of you out there looking for good or even decent pizza in Chandler....stick with Dominoes....it is a lot cheaper and I cannot believe I am saying this but.....better!

If you have read my reviews and agree with my reviews....STAY AWAY from this location of ROSATIS pizza!

Until next time....

Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Every since they changed owners I will not eat the wings I hate it when businesses change owners then they start changing things that worked. I will not be eating here again. The wing \"sauce\" is horrible my wings were dry and raw at the same time. Their solution was to bring them back and get new ones! Why would I want to drive again 30 mins to get something I should have got right the first time? Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I always get delivery. They're always earlier then what they state. The food is always good and my order is always correct."}
{"text":"Delivery is always on expect time (30-40 minutes) and the food never arrives cold  

We usually order (when we do order) a cheese pie but with double dough, simple & good. If you like a thick crust, try it!

Jumbo wings: horrible, horrible. Half breaded/fried & the sauce (I'm not sure the flavor) nasty.

Btw- if you're like us & you order the Chicago deep dish...DON'T unless you like just cheese & a lot of sauce. Not really a \"Chicago Deep Dish\" to my standards. 

One item I recommend off of their menu is, Zippolis: warm pieces of fried dough, covered in a cinnamon sugar and served with Nutella sauce."}
{"text":"I love the Chicago deep dish pizza! It cost about 35 dollars but it's so big and thick we made 2+ meals out of it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Forced to give 1 star. Ordered 2 pies. One had chicken, garlic, tomato and cheese. The other was a cheese and pepperoni. The crust was thin crust and tasted like cardboard. The pepperoni had Barely any sauce. Dominos has better pizza. Never again, back to grimaldi's"}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the salad and entree came out at the same time.
I sent thr entree back and told the waitress to remake it and bring it back after I finish my salad. She didi not like that one bit. I think she told the cook. I think he did something to the food When it came back I could tell it was just placed under warming lights.Before I was finished I was keeling over with SHARP stomack pains. I was almost going to call the police and EMS services,. I suffered all night with severe stomach pains. I will nerver go back."}
{"text":"Ehh....  the chickie that answers the phone...sooooo sweet, but unfortunately...we received thin crust instead of deep dish....slightly (not!)  minor issue. 
We ate it...we were starving after a cancelled flight tonight....
Pizzie is okay ... Prices are okay....just okay....isn't worth the $40 with tip for tonight's din din."}
{"text":"Was excited this place opened up again.  Called to order my pizza tonight and when i ordered the rosatis monster pizza  I asked for no onions.  The lady told me she couldn't leave off any toppings just add them.  I said so you are,telling me you can't leave onions off of my pizza, which she replyed no.  I then talked to manager who said she was new and they could make my pizza without onions.   So I then placed my order for pizza,and wings and was told they are out of wings.  Really disappointing.  We ordered from tailgaters instead always good.  Will not be giving  Rosatis another try."}
{"text":"We ordered a Chicago style well done. First they brought the wrong pizza and then when they returned we received our pizza that was dough. UGH!  This is the very last time the Rosatis on  Cheyenne will get our money. Terrible....when we told them they offered a $5 off coupon. huh? they were kidding...right?
Save your money."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town! Thin crust all the way and they put the toppings under the cheese!"}
{"text":"This could be the worst cracker with cheese on it I've ever had. I can't even call this pizza!! Hard crunchy not crispy bite, a crunchy snap to it......gross!! Ohh and it was cut into squares and all uneven. This blew my mind!! Usually when you have been flying across the country and haven't eaten all day everything and anything would taste good at this moment. To top it all off beside the worst cracker cheese n meat I've ever eaten these two cracker pizzas cost us $50!!!!!!! Absolutely outrageous and it tasted horrendous. If all u have at home is crackers n cheese and this is the last stop besides the shell gas station for something quick save ur money and taste buds and eat the crackers you have at home I bet you anything you want it will be a better dinner than we just had from here!! Our 1 year old loves pizza and she wouldn't even eat it. TERRIBLE!!  Pictures to follow"}
{"text":"now this is what I call pizza! The crust, flavor, and balance of all the ingredients make this by far the best in the west.

The energetic staff screams Chicago! Pizza is what they are all about."}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of Rosati's but this location has been inconstant in its quality and delivery time several times. The last time I ordered a burger and onion rings here via delivery and they both showed up soggy. This is a great place to eat, I just wasn't thrilled with the delivery service."}
{"text":"Being a recovering former Flatlander I was well familiar with Rosati's before I moved to Madison. Having gone to several of them around Chicago I've found there to be a lot of variation from individual restaurant in the chain. I just wanted to make that clear so I identified that it was this specific Rosati's I was talking about.

Anyhow! I've ordered pizza from them a half a dozen times in a couple of years and have dined in once. They are my Go-To for \"as-near-to-real-Chicago-style-as-I-can-get\" pizza in Madison and they do it well. The crust is perfectly crisped, the cheese thick as it should be, and the toppings generous. They have a well seasoned sausage that I just love. I will note that when I order from them I *do* ask for less sauce on top as they have occasionally gone wild with it (and sauce gone wild just is nothing anyone should have to deal with).

Anyhow -- I've had other things from them as well and I have to say their pasta has not wowed me but it is pretty good. Their biggest weakness seems to be their sauce; It just needs more flavor or at least a stronger flavor. 

For the bread lover you'll want to hit up the Nuggets but don't do it alone. If you think these are a side order for one person you will find yourself awash in a tide of deliciously fried, lightly sauced goodness that your heart may not recover from. 

The service when I had dined in was good; I didn't go long without a refill and they checked in often enough that we knew they were watching but not so often that it was obnoxious. There was a little delay before we ordered but that can happen when it gets busy so I am not about to begrudge them that.

Their Chicago-style really is the closest to downtown Chicago I've had since I've been up here and that alone will keep me coming back indefinitely... or at least until Gino's or Giordano's crawl their way up I-90."}
{"text":"I have been ordering From here 2 to 4 times a month for about a year now. Prior to today we have only had one other issue and that was when about 30% of the pizza was bare. Today there was a computer glitch. I ordered a large pizza and received a medium one. I have the order listed on my IPad for the driver and when I called to complain that there was a order issue. Driver could care less and the manager could only say one phrase \"our computer said medium\" I offered to fwd it to him since he is a worthless POS. After such horrid customer service we will never order from here again. Too many great pizza places to eat at that fix their screw ups. I had proof he basically said to F O."}
{"text":"We have been going here since they opened. Totally satisfied with the food and the great service. Never let us down."}
{"text":"When everything is 50% off perhaps it tastes twice as good? I was tempted to give 4 stars here, but we haven't gone back, so I decided that perhaps at the time we were doubly impressed because of our magic half-off everything coupon. That's a good deal!

The Chicago lady who sold us our car had insisted that Rosati's was the best in Vegas. Granted, she gets her Rosati's from a Henderson location, but we gave this one a try. Thanks to the coupon, we went a little overboard and ordered salad, wings and a pizza. Now, that's just crazy.

The salad is delicious. One of the most solid green offerings I have had at a casual place. The dressing appeared homemade, and all of the ingredients were fresh. I was impressed. I was equally impressed by the artery-clogging garlic knots. I rarely find myself unable to resist a bread basket, but I may have eaten 20 of these tasty morsels.

Chicken wings were good.

Now, as for the pizza, it was perplexing. When it arrived to the table, we had to confirm with the waitress that this was indeed the deep dish. She said it was, but honestly it looked more like a Pizza Hut deep dish than the brick o' cheese I associate with Chicago-style. It didn't come out in one of those pans that the waitress has to carry with a special wrench. It was like a thin deep-dish or something. The sauce was good. Overall, a nice tasting pizza, but not as sinfully cheesy as the Chicago-styles I have had in the past. 

As for service, when we first arrived we had this on the ball, chipper teenager, but half way through he left, and so did our service. Kind of a 50/50 on the service as well. 

I'll definitely be watching my mailbox for another coupon."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years since they've opened. However, the quality of service has gone down. Either this location does not have enough staff help, or they are genuinely slow. Whether taking out or dining in the wait has been outrageous.

Most of my wanting to review came from my last experience in dining in. First, the dining area was not kept very clean. Although there are many families coming in and out of the small space, I think the cleanliness needs to be priority. Also, once we finally got our order taken it took forever for it to come, just to have two of the three meals ordered be cold.

This is not the Rosati's it used to be, for sure. So I know if I plan to eat there I need to order at least an hour before I'm hungry and to only take out."}
{"text":"If you eat here be prepared to need a nap afterwards!!!!  Amazing Chicago style pizza, delicious bread sticks and caprese salad.  Everything was super tasty and filling.  There was no skimping out on the portions either.  When you watch friends (ladies) eat 5 breadsticks in a row and a huge slice of pizza pie, you know it is awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Best in town. I've been trying pizza all over town and finally found a great go to place for Chicago pie."}

{"text":"This place has an Amaazing Atmosphere, my girlfriends' from Chicago and she's really picky about how places try to recreate their own Chicago style-type foods. She hands down gives this place her respect because they nail it every time with they're Deep Dish Pizzas. Rosati's became one of our Favorite Pizza Pubs right off the bat!"}

This is far and away, the best Italian take-out/delivery in the Valley! Their Penne A-la Vodka is enough for a tubby shit like me to be full on and their pies are, ehem, perfect every time. This has been my experience over 3 years with these cats. Their thin crust is, like totally like, crunchy like, totally to the max and gag me with a running chainsaw, their sauce doesn't taste totally like sugar, OMG! OK, Valley Girl is gone. Don't pretend you didn't read that in the voice of a valley girl tho! They have deals for repeat customers too. They don't charge $5 for a pie, but you don't get crazy heartburn from their food either, well worth the price and I am a fan."}

{"text":"I had a bad experience here and will not go back. I ordered a 10 inch Chicago style pizza (pepperoni and sausage add on was 4 dollars extra). Had to ask for plastic wear, have a grease stain on my shirt from carrying out the box (no bag included), and when I called to let manager know that the first slice I grabbed had one piece of pepperoni and 3 sausages on it, he backed his workers saying he saw them make it. I did not ask for any money back, just indicating the 4 dollar price for lack of. Pizza was not flavorful. Ranch is 50 cents extra. Hopefully, they will fix things but I won't go back to this location. I will try another location one more time to see if is better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Rosati's is my favorite pizza in the Madison area.  There's something magical about the sauce, cheese, and their italian sausage (we roll simple in my household)...  Very few pizzas give me that satisfying \"hunger quenching\" feeling that Rosati's gives me.  Unfortunately, that leads to the problem of not knowing when to stop!  But that's my problem, not theirs...

I've carried out for lunch as well as ate in with the family.  I've never been disappointed!  The kids love it.  I love it.  My extended family loves it.  It's awesome.  The grab-and-go lunch options are nice too (I work nearby)."}
{"text":"The food is very good!  The service is HORRIBLE!!!  I came here for the first time a few months ago.   The sewer trap exhaust overwhelmed the restaurant.  We had to take our food to go it was so nauseating.  Food we took home was excellent.   NOW... we decided to give it another chance. .. food is that good.  Went back, and the smell is fixed.  I ordered a meatball sub... my partner ordered a small pizza... a SMALL, THIN CRUST... you know the cracker kind... well I got my sandwich in about 10 minutes.  My partner... they forgot to make her pizza and didn't realize it until they brought my sandwhich.  So I knew her pizza was going to be delayed 10 minutes.  I was wrong... after 25 minutes... THIN CRUST FOLKS... they said it would be 2 more minutes.   Long story short... after asking what they were going to fo to compensate us for the lack of bringing the food together and in a timely fashion, I was given a coupon from the Sunday insert.  It doesn't take 25 minutes for a thin crust... they forgot her order and when we asked for some sort of compensation got essentially nothing... except this free advise from the guy at the counter... \"make sure you say you want the food to show up together.\"  Apparently when 2 people go to sit down to eat together... that's not automatically presumed that they want to eat together.   I am so mad about what happened and the details of my conversations with the 3 stooges behind the counter over this meal last night (all the details I left out)  that I doubt I will be back regardless of the food.  They are not the only game in town on pizza and subs.  No customer service skills whatsoever and no vested interest about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Visiting my in-laws in Vegas and stopped by here to eat. Awesome food and service. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The girls that work there have marbles for brains. Apparently 16 isn't the age to start working. We have tried this place three times and each time they couldn't input the address right. And hour and 15 minutes later they said they didn't have any record of it being ordered!! This happened 3 TIMES! The best part when I asked to speak to the manager the girl says she's the closest thing they got and hangs up on me! Those nits should be let go and hire people that can function and not be rude little girls to customers."}
{"text":"It looked amazing, we were so exicited to try deep dish pizza over all it lacked flavor."}
{"text":"We've lived in our apartment for about 6 months, and for 6 months, we've been stuck ordering not spectacular pizza.  Places that just aren't very good, or they screw up our orders, or they use toppings like they're on rations.  

Yesterday, my husband and I wanted pizza for dinner.  
I looked up a few places, and none of them delivered to our location...and then I saw Rosati's.  

I LOVE Rosati's pizza.  I have since I lived in Chicago.  
I called them to see if they would deliver to us, in outer Mongolia (what it feels like sometimes), and THEY SAID THEY WOULD!!!

I did a little happy dance, and said I'd call back after we looked at the menu.  

We decided on a medium Chicago style pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and spinach.  We were told an hour for the delivery. 

About 20 minutes early, we received our delicious, perfect pizza.  I'm telling you, I could not be happier if we were back home eating pizza downtown.

We will most definitely be ordering from Rosati's again.  If I remember, when I reheat a slice tonight for dinner, I will take a picture.  I was too starving to think about it. 

BTW, the medium Chicago style will feed my husband and I at least twice, where normally a medium pizza doesn't fill us up very much...a whole one in one sitting...we'd need breadsticks or something."}
{"text":"Just had Rosati's for lunch today. It was okay. Not as GREAT as it has been in the past. I picked it up at 20 mins (like they told me to when I ordered it), however, the cheese was already set. Once home, I began to chow down and noticed the pepperoni tastes  a little different. This is actually the 2nd time I've bought pizza and the meat tastes different. 2 weeks ago was the 1st time, so I don't know if they're switching up vendors, products or what? But when a recipe is perfect - you really shouldn't mess with it.

I'm sure this won't be the last time I order from Rosati's. Other than the fore mentioned statement their pizza sauce and thin crust is explosively good."}
{"text":"After living in Chicago for 6 months I got a major addiction to Chicago-style \"stuffed\" pizza. I was never able to find anything that came close to living up to Chicago standards anywhere else in the country until I tried Roasti's here in Vegas. 

To be 100% honest, I would NEVER order Rosati's in Chicago. It doesn't live up to Giordanno's or Art of Pizza or Lou Malnati's. BUT for Vegas I think this pizza is awesome and definitely stays true to the \"art form\" that is Chicago pizza. I hate when places call their pizza Chicago style and just serve you pan-pizza. Chicago pizza is NOT pan pizza. 

The bottom of the crust shouldn't be too thick.. the cheese has to be stringy and gooey and the tomato sauces goes on TOP. That is Chicago style! The cheese.. the crust.. the sauce.. this place has it going on! While it certainly couldn't hold it's own in the city of Chicago (in my opinion), it's the best I've found in Vegas by FAR. Pie town doesn't even come close to living up."}
{"text":"I just hung up with Rosati's pizza after calling to let them know of our poor experience.  My boyfriend went there with our two kids to pick up the pizza.  He waited 10 minutes watching our pizza sit there while they served about 10 other customers picking up their pizza.  By the time we got it it was cold.  The kids were hungry so he brought it home and we ate it.  Cold pizza is better than no pizza and hungry kids.  I called Rosati's; while on hold I listened to their \"Satisfaction guaranteed\" message.  Finally talked to a woman who claimed she was a manager.  I asked for a refund because my pizza was cold.  She insisted my pizza was not cold, and refused to give me a refund because we already ate some of the pizza.  So I'm supposed to turn around with my hungry kids and bring the pizza back and wait 45 minutes for another one?  Please.  Clearly they are disorganized about their service because they couldn't even find our pizza for 10 min while it was sitting right there getting cold.  She was extremely rude and obviously uninterested in providing good customer service.  1 star because the cold pizza was edible."}
{"text":"Just moved to Scottsdale from Chicago.  I was soooooo missing my Chicago style deep dish.  Found this Rosati's tonight.  Awesome slice of home.  And the atmosphere is great - non pretentious pizza parlor setting.  And Jason will take good care of you!  Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing Mango Habanero wings in all of Arizona!!  Tap beer is ice cold, and there is a warm and friendly sports bar atmosphere!  A must visit if you haven't already.  WARNING!!  If you go once...you'll be back over and over and over..."}
{"text":"Dined inside Rosati's for the first time on a Sunday night. I dined alone that night but craved pizza, so I opted for a calzone so I did not over-order. The mozzarella was deliciously gooey. The sausage stood out. I also ordered the calzone with fresh garlic and red onion which gave it a great balance.

My only regret about this visit is that I didn't get a deep dish pizza instead -- I get the impression that if their toppings are this great, their deep dish probably won't disappoint. Will be coming back again when I get a chance. Maybe with friends this time!"}
{"text":"The pizza is tasty. We had the deep dish cheese. But it arrived a disaster. Then the offered to make a new one and send it out. Yeah ok no thanks im good. I don't want to wait another hour for food. The pasta had good flavor but was way over cooked. So we got half off the pizza cost after going back and forth with them. Poor customer service honestly."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from one of their salads. My aunt ate the same salad and also got violently ill so I know it was from them. I called and they refused to do anything about it. I filed a complaint with the Department of Health. I was sick for two days. I wish I could give zero stars. Ruined my trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"YELP got it wrong. Employees , friends or the owners must be writing the review. The \"in dining \" is two tables against a wall - one in front of the drinks - soda cooler. No beer or wine, patio seating was two tables on the sidewalk. Plus there was a strong unpleasant odor. Did not try any of the food, just turned and left."}
{"text":"BEWARE THIS PLACE WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE TOTAL OF YOUR ORDER WITH THEIR MENU PRICES!

My wife and co workers ordered food last night.  They asked to pay separate for their orders.  The restaurant said it wasn't a problem.  They noticed after the fact that all 7 people were charged a $3 delivery fee.  THAT'S $21 ON TOP OF THEIR TIP THEY ALREADY GAVE THE DRIVER!!!  No one bothered to tell them they were getting hit up 7 times for a delivery fee, including the driver.

They also asked if there were any specials or coupons going on at the moment.  The person on the phone said no.  They received a menu with their order and sure enough there were coupons.  

On to the food, my wife's portion to the feast was salad.  For $14 she received 2 salads that fit in two small containers.  She said that a 99 cent salad at Wendy's had more going on than her $14 salads.  

That's the last time anyone in this family orders from Rosatti's.   

The bottom line is this area is CRAWLING with amazing Italian food.  IMHO, there is no room for ripping off your customers, there are so many other options in this area to choose from.  Judging by the low reviews and lack of effort this company is making to make things right, I can't see them being in business much longer."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and salad for dinner after Comicon for delivery to a hotel. The pizza was fairly good & delivery timely. However, Rosati's failed to deliver napkins, forks and plates. The lady who I placed my order with didn't ask if that was anything we needed. I called to ask about getting plates and napkins and was given a lecture that they don't typically deliver plates & napkins - we'd need to ask for it. Really? You're taking an order for delivery to a hotel! The question should have at least been asked. I certainly did not need a lecture that I should ask for plates & napkins in the future! And I was then told it would be another hour and a half to receive them."}
{"text":"I didn't like the Italian beef sandwich at all no flavor the meat tasted like packaged sandwich meat.I did like the fried cauliflower and my husband had a meat lovers pizza he said was good. I'm from Chicago this tastes nothing like a Chicago Italian beef...."}
{"text":"Waste of $15.00. Not really Chicago style. Ordered pepperoni. Used to the pepperoni being throughout the pizza. What I received had pepperoni ONLY on top and there weren't many.  So so disappointed. Won't try that again.  Suggest they contact Chicago's Pizza in San Antonio to find out how they make a good Chicago Pizza -- really  miss them."}
{"text":"This place used to have such good food. It was our favorite lunch spot and the staff always did a great job of taking care of us. A few months ago we noticed a sign that said they were \"under new management\" so we were eager to see what would change. Unfortunately whatever new management took over made the place really bad. First of all, they can't seem to keep the same staff. We've been in 3 times since and haven't seen the same serving staff in here twice. 

The past two times we've come in, our pizza was burnt. Now, if you serve pizza for a living, you have to know what a burnt pizza looks like. Why would you serve it?  Today, our pizza came after a lengthy delay and it was cold and starting to get hard already. How long had it been sitting in the back?

The previous time we were there, we ordered the mozzarella sticks and they didn't even make them. Both of the last times, the server disappeared for more than 15 mins each time. That would explain why the good is suffering.  

Sorry Rosati's, third time is a charm. If you can't get it together by now you aren't going to. We're done. You e lost a customer."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and appetizers. Delivery service is always in a timely manner. Location wise, this is a better choice than other pizza places. But the prices are high for some pretty basic pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered this in August 17, 2015. I got this from this address, I just looked up the order through grub hub after eating at a different Rosati's today.  It was a huge difference. 

This was delivery so I can't comment on service, just the food.

We got chicken parm. and fettuccine alfredo with chicken.  Both came with garlic bread. 

The good news was that the chicken in the chicken parm. was very soft and cooked just the way I like it. 

Weirdly, it was sliced into thin pieces like you'd expect with the fettuccine alfredo, but not chicken parm, though if that makes it come so soft, then it's worth it being sliced up.

The tomato sauce was very salty and made this meal not so good because of that.  

Also, there was only a small amount of chicken for a dinner time portion.  I'd say only one small chicken cutlet sliced up.  There was at least a big portion of spaghetti, though the chicken parm should be much of the meal as I ordered chicken parm., not spaghetti with chicken.

The garlic bread was very hard and dry, it tasted like a very big crouton.  

The fettuccine alfredo was awful.  The sauce was really bad tasting (I think it was made with some kind of cheese that I don't like in addition to parmesan which I do)  and the very few slices of chicken were salty and a little on the burnt side. There was also plenty of fettuccine, as it should be as it is a fettuccine dish."}
{"text":"If they got rid of the rude, snobby girls at the front counter and lowered their prices a little this place might get 2 stars! 
A large 2 topping thin crust pizza for $27.99 is ridiculous! And they won't honor coupons from other Rosati's locations."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow when you're dining in, but other than that this is my favorite pizza close to home. I probably eat here like once a week. I love their thin crust, they have the best sauce. Will continue to order here."}
{"text":"Another disappointing meal at Rosati's. I just got back from a trip to Chicago and nothing about this place reminds me of the Windy City.

My husband and his co-workers, on the other hand seemed to love this place. 

The service was very prompt and courteous.

We ordered the following items:
 
Pepperoni & pineapple pizza (didn't try it but 1/2 was left)
Fabulous Four (didn't try this one either but 1/2 was left)
White pizza    B-
Chicken alfredo pizza   C+
Pizza Dough Nuggets  A-"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Walked in and ordered a large pizza to go, had a beer while we waited and every one was very friendly and the pizza was delicious! Next time we will dine in. Great job!!"}
{"text":"I love Rosati's pizza! It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for. 

I don't like that they charge for delivery... Or at least they used to. I stopped having it delivered because it was $5 fee plus a $5 tip. So, I saved the money and picked it up myself.

Besides that, the pizza is really good. Even a plain pepperoni is very yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Well done Rosati's. We had the deep dish and the kids had the double dough. Both were delish! It was a bit pricey but we will definitely order again when the adults want pizza."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location! They made me a really salty monster pizza and when I called and complained the Manager said if I would've complained yesterday he would've help me! I doubt this because he wouldn't do anything today! This pizza cost $30! Don't waste your time and money going to a place that doesn't know the meaning of customer service!! The joke is I've been going there for 10 years! This is the first time I ever complained. Well it's the last time I will go there! So it really doesn't matter. Lost a 10 year customer over what $15 bucks. That's smart!"}
{"text":"Rose is a great waitress, she has such great personality and very attentive throughout our visit.  The food was great, thank you Rose."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery, be aware, the delivery time was twice the time we were quoted. Pizza was delivered cold and missing garlic bread we ordered. Upon calling they offered 20% off our next order (adding a credit for the missing bread). Not quite what I would expect given I was delivered what amounted to a take and bake pizza. Poor quality and worse, poor response to the problem."}
{"text":"Not even one star. Horrible cold pizza. Ate in dining area. Dirty table. Pizza dough undercooked. Employees nonchalant and uncaring. Couldn't even eat threw it in the trash"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town hands down. Service is a work in progress for sure. Great bartender, and the best pizza make up for service issues. Order pizza well done and make sure it has sausage on it"}
{"text":"With sooo many pizza places out there my favorite will always be Pizza Hut...BUT there are other good pizza places to eat like this one! They have good pizzas and my dessert happens to be my favorite their Zeppoles!!  

We used to hang out here to eat after shooting pool at Mickey's Cue!!!"}
{"text":"A few years ago when this place first opened my wife and I were excited because there weren't very many restaurants in the area.  We went in to order our first Rosati's Pizza but when we presented them with our \"Entertainment Book\" coupon (kids sell these books as fundraisers) they stated they don't take those coupons. (It is true their store wasn't listed on the back but we thought it was cause the store was so new). When we pressed them they plainly stated that they didn't have to take coupons because they are so busy.  We decided we didn't need to eat there and left.

Well, several years have gone by now and we haven't been back to Rosati's but the wait at our favorite Italian place was over an hour for take out last night (I won't tell you the name because its already too crowded).  We weighed our options and went through our \"Entertainment book\" and found Rosati's.  It is close to the house so we decided we'd give them another chance.  Upon arrival we noticed that this location is still not listed on the back. I decided I would just ask if they accept it and if they don't we'll leave again - probably never to return.  The cashier politely said they don't accept the coupon but she could offer me a 30% discount instead.  This sounded reasonable to me so we decide to order.

We got the 18\" thin crust (+pepperoni +sausage) pizza with a dozen mild wings with Blue Cheese dressing. The pizza was really good.  It had more cheese than my wife likes but I like lots of cheese.   The wings were pretty good too (a bit thin but nice and crispy).  The dressing seemed a bit old with a dry film forming on the top so we didn't eat it.  I'll give them a pass on that - as long as it doesn't happen again.

Overall, this was a good experience with good food.  The cashier was really friendly and won this business a customer. 

The pizza prices are a bit higher than the other near-by places and you must get he pizza to go.  If your looking to eat-in, try Barro's Pizza across the street - their pizza is good too."}
{"text":"I tried this pizza for the first time, despite the negative reviews on here. The thin crust pizzas we ordered for take out were piping hot, they happily gave us hot sauce on the side. The pizza sauce had great flavor and was packed on top with fresh vegetables and a ton of cheese. My family thought it was delicious! 
The place seemed extremely understaffed for a Friday night, but the young man working the register was nice and respectful- although he seemed extremely stressed and overworked. I'm giving it 3 stars due to the staffing issues- it's good pizza, but they need more staff to make it run more smoothly. A dedicated register person to answer phones and verify online orders would help."}
{"text":". .  We're visiting from Cali... We weren't too impressed.  We ordered at 5:59pm..3 pizzas total of $90 for delivery..mind you. . There's a delivery charge. .We were told our pizzas will be delivered in an hour.  After snacking on popcorn and cheese balls for 1.5 hrs... we realized our pizzas hadn't been delivered yet. I called at 7:30pm.. I was put on hold, then was told our pizzas are in their way.  . .7:45.. they finally arrived!  We tell the senior citizen delivery man this isn't right we waited so long! ! He puts the pizza back in the bag then tells me to call the mngr! My husband then tells HIM to call the mngr!! Ehhhh... I called!  Mngr tells me she's sorry. . She will talk to her people who took the order. . She goes on to say the pizzas we ordered takes 40 mins to make. . Had I known. ..I wouldn't have ordered!! Either take $20 off or take your pizzas back!! ... The Hubby was NOT happy. .. but Thank you mngr Jessica for recognizing your staffs error of misinformation and taking $20 off.. but next visit to Vegas. .our business will go elsewhere. . Especially because our crust was burnt!"}
{"text":"The pizza isn't worth the hassle. The service is slow, wait times are a joke ie 25-30 mins really means about an hour. And while I waited for my order 2 ppl called to complain about there order being wrong and they messed up two ppl's order in front of me. This will literally be the last time I come here. And I strongly recommend that any and all save your time and money and not come here."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this Rosatti's up until I ordered a family size order of the penne pomodoro. The girl who took my order didn't provide the right size, once I got there I paid and they brought out the food and I'm like that's not the right size that I wanted. If I had ordered from the Rosatti's I normally go to on 59th ave and union hills they would've provided me with the correct size and only charged me $20 or so instead at this location they charged me over $40 for the size I wanted and the manager didn't bother to apologize for the mistake that was made or compensate by giving me a discount or anything. Won't be visiting this location or recommending it anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered the monster pizza with standard dough.

1 sentence,  This is NOT Pizza!.

there is dough, sauce, cheese but its not pizza anymore than a lunchables pizza.

Its just a bunch of ingredients on a flat bread.
Literally its a flat bread.  the crust isn't even remotely close to pizza.

*you've been warned*"}
{"text":"Poor service, often take over 1 hour for delivery, often didn't get add on items, but the pizza quality is great!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered a 14\" thin crust pizza with pepperoni and sausage from this location. Although prep/delivery time took close to an hour, it was well worth the wait.

The pizza was piping hot and came with a generous amount of toppings, although I think the prep table applied too much cheese and less sauce to the center of the pie.  The sauce was savory with the right balance of spices.

In light of Michelle W's previous review, I'm inclined to give this location 4 stars instead of 5.  My rating may change if the consistency and quality continues to be above board with future orders."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I've heard in the past they've been hit or miss (possibly more miss than hit). As I am only a recently Arizona resident I cannot validate this. What I will say is that right now they seem to be doing something right judging by the amount of phone calls they take and people picking orders up when I do the same. I've ordered carry out several times and what I've received is something consistent with well-balanced flavors. This is not your sweet sauce style of pizza. In fact, they don't use a lot of sauce at all which may or may not be your kind of thing. The crust is the thin crispy type. I can tell you that one of these little square slices is good the next day.

My only complaint is that as the cheese is not the ooey gooey stringy type so the toppings and cheese do have a tendency to slide off the crust when you bite in. But it doesn't really matter when you've got the flavor to make up for it.

Now if you excuse me... another slice is calling me."}
{"text":"This is the second time my friend and I have ordered pizza from this establishment.   Both times the person answering the phone was short with us and acted as if they were doing us a favor by even talking to us.  We waited an hour the first time and finally received the pizza after calling them a second time.   Tonight an hour and a half.....and the pizza never came.  We called to complain and were hung up on.   I will never use this business again and highly recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Rosati's for a few years and last night was my first chance. We ordered 24 Jumbo Wings for $19.89, and a medium Godfather pizza for around $17. The Jumbo wings were the biggest wings I have ever tried. Very plump and full of flavor. Though for Honey Hot, they did not seem very spicy. The Godfather pizza's ingredients were Italian sausage, fresh garlic, grilled onions and Rosati's hot giardiniera. The pizza was more spicy than the wings and we loved both! 

We ordered off of GrubHub, which gave us a $3 (delivery fee) discount for spending over $20. I really enjoy using GrubHub because I can pay for the food and tip with my credit card ahead of time. The delivery boy was also very friendly which I appreciated.   I did sign up for coupon offers, but the other discounts did not seem very appealing to me. While it is pricier than I usually spend we received amazing pizza and wings, so this will be a once in a while treat for us. Quality over quantity!

*Also, I know we ordered a big order of wings, but they did not skimp on the ranch sauce which means a lot to me! I hate when pizza places get greedy with the sauce. The delivery driver also offered extra cheese and pepper packets for us also."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. I'm from Chicago and lived in New York so I'm pretty picky. The sauce is not as spiced as Chicago joints but passable. Unfortunately it's the only pizza we can stand to eat near us because they are rarely on time and it's sure to be lukewarm. If they could get their system together (maybe they need Chef Ramsey to teach them the system of timing) it could do really well."}
{"text":"This was just like Rosati's Pizza in Chicago!! It really satisfied our pizza craving's from home. We did get cannoli for desert, it was perfect. Can't wait to try other items on the menu. Need to try the BBQ pizza  always a big hit at home. Service was great. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Best deep dish around, great Chicago style .  Definitely recommend over all other pizza places in Vegas, must try!"}
{"text":"So I was recommended this restaurant by a friend and decided to go ahead and give it a try.
I called in my order,
1 12inch chicken Alfredo Pizza
I am at home with my girlfriend watching movies and realized that it was 40 minutes since I had placed my order. I called in and spoke with the very nice lady at to go (not sarcasm). She said maybe 20 more minutes until it would arive. So finally and hour and a half of waiting happened until it finally showed up. It was 16$ in total and I handed the delivery lady a 20$. All she did was take the money and hand me a pizza. I greeted her and I got back a meh. Then I said have a good night and I didn't get eye contact or a response. That made me very angry as I work and manage a restaurant and was disgusted by how I was treated. I opened the pizza which was room temperature at best and more as me and my girlfriend started eating it it was just what seemed to be a block of cheese and bread. Soggy, stale crust, bad service, etc. I DO NOT recommend the Rosatis on 40th st. And Thomas. Absurd!"}
{"text":"Again after several attempts to rectify the lack of commitment from the local management. They still provide less than acceptable customer service.  I  hope they close and never return. Maybe they should close this location !!!"}
{"text":"This originally started out to be a less than one star review. Last night I ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house less than a mile away. It took about an hour, no complaint there. When my pizza arrived the guy seemed in a big hurry, so much so that he didn't even check to see if I had given him the right amount. I had also given him a tip. So I took the pizza inside and opened it to find it was a scrambled mess. Part of the pizza was stuck to the top of the box and the rest was all piled in a heap in one corner. I was not a HAPPY CAMPER and was ready to give them a bad review but decided to call and give them a chance to redeem themselves. The lady was very appoligic and offered to have my order redone and delivered. About 30 minutes later my pizza was delivered by a different driver who was very apologetic. He took the scrambled pizza, appologized again and left. 
The pizza was very good and the Customer Service was excellent. I \"may\" even order again but maybe next time I will pick it up myself."}
{"text":"We have picked up pizzas, and ordered delivery from this Rosati's location for years. We absolutely love it. The amount of mozzarella cheese that is on their pizzas is absolutely incredible, the sauce is mild, and the crust that we like is the thin Chicago style which is always perfectly baked! Check out the photo of the half pepperoni (half sausage) pizza; there is so much smooth melted cheese that you can't even see the pepperoni. I can never get \"too much\" of this pizza!"}
{"text":"i've been here before a couple times and I enjoyed it until ordering for carry out recently. I had called in for one pizza and hadn't picked it up for 30 to 45 minutes because I was trying to get my bank card reset up before I went in. I got a call from the owner yelling at me about how I should not place an order if I'm not going to pick it up and she very rudely explained that I should not order anymore and hung up on me"}
{"text":"Went back in tonight. Food was kind of meh but the part that annoys me is that we were told \"15-20\" minutes and it was almost an hour to the minute. While sitting in the place listening, they kept telling people \"20 minutes\" and not meeting that timeline at all. Also, I prepaid for my food online and the girls working the counter seemed to have no idea how that worked. I had to show them the sheet of paper they set on the counter showing my order and the fact that it was paid. 

I'm fine with an hour wait for food on a Friday night, but tell people it's going to be an hour wait. If you're going there on a meal break from work, you generally don't want to spend an hour waiting around their tiny lobby hoping your food is going to come out in time. I doubt I'll bother going back, it's not worth the aggravation and there are other Rosati's that hopefully have their act together."}
{"text":"They won't deliver to my house, 2.9 miles away. I can literally see the Bermuda/Silverado Ranch traffic light from my house. The Rosati's I used to order from, 2.8 miles away is closed because they are moving locations, way to pick up the slack. This location lost the chance to gain a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Usually I'm a big fan of Rosatti's but this time they really let me down. Called ahead to order fettuccine alfredo, and there was chicken in it. I'm a vegetarian. I waited 20 mins for it to be made got home and had to go back and wait another 20 mins. After 3 hours at the gym I was dying for some pasta. They were apologetic. I appreciate the pasta remake, but I don't think I can trust you guys anymore."}
{"text":"This is the regular pizza place when the wife and I want to order in. Delivery is usually in the window they say it will be. 

Pizza is solid. This was her favorite pizza place when we lived in Arizona. This locations seems to make their pies a lot cheesier (for some that's good.... for us it's just different). We always go with the thin crust. It's a can't miss.  

We tried the deep dish once. It was a nice change of pace. Incredibly filling and delicious. We bought the meat lover's deep dish special. Definitely worth throwing into the rotation. 

If you live in Summerlin and are looking for a place to make your regular.... it's definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  This is the real deal!!  In the tradition of the Rosati family. The wings were amazing but the pizza is truly the best. Great crust perfect ratio of sauce and cheese. We added sausage (incredible flavor), onions and bell pepper. We're from Chicago and as pizza lovers, we know great pizza when we have it!
Great service from Brittany and Lynn. Couldn't have been better. Very friendly and went out of their way to make our experience an exceptional one. 
Nice atmosphere and plenty of tv's for viewing. Great bar!
We truly look forward to returning next week. Our \"new\" favorite place!!  Thanks Jason (owner) for stopping by our table and taking time to introduce yourself and making sure everything was how we wanted it. Great way to run a business!"}
{"text":"The low rating is mostly for everything being over priced for the size. I did really like the food though. But the mozzarella sticks were not very great. The fried pickles were actually great. The lasagna has always been my favorite here. The pizza isn't the most amazing thing I've had but it's decent enough to eat. The burger was actually great. I did receive the food cold due to the freeway by me being closed and when the driver arrived he proceeded to complain about how the freeway way closed and they don't even deliver this far, I actually apologized for that and he was just rude. I do like Rosatis but I guess I'll just be going to another location to take my money."}
{"text":"The last time I got pizza to go from Rosoti's a few years ago I thought it was pretty good. This time we dined in for happy hour and I was very disappointed. I had received a flyer about their happy 10\" pizza for $6. The server didn't know about that special and apparently the manager didn't either because he made her show him the flyer I brought with me. We ordered onion rings, a fried dough appetizer served with marinara, and the pizza. The onion rings were great. The fried dough appetizer was terrible.  We were expecting something similar to garlic knots. That's how they were described on the menu. We each ate only one and they had given us a huge serving. When it came time to leave we asked for a box for the pizza. The server asked if we wanted to take the dough things and I told her we didn't like them at all. I'm pretty sure she tried to get the manager to take them off the check. They weren't and we paid for them. I won't be back. And being in the restaurant business myself I can tell you a $4.50 item on the check is not worth losing someone as a customer. It looks like a lot of people feel the same way because we only saw one other person in the restaurant while we were there. Also the restaurant was freezing and smelled strongly of cleaning chemicals. Not a good dining experience and I don't recommend their pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and the food was hot and fresh when delivered.  We ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza (thin crust), bbq  chicken wings and fried mozzarella sticks.  All the food was fresh and hot upon delivery.  I was impressed with the person that took our phone order, impressed with the delivery service and impressed with the quality of the food so what more can you ask for?  I will order from here again! All the employees we encountered had great attitudes and that really makes a great experience. I would order again from here and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We tried the Chicago style pizza and hot buffalo wings. Both were good, but neither was particularly noteworthy. The pizza had a very thick and somewhat doughy crust and a good amount of cheese and toppings. The sauce is a little on the bland side and the two pizzas I ordered both failed to travel particularly well even though it wasn't a terribly long drive home. The first small pizza was sausage and pepperoni and it was probably the better of the two. The sausage was somewhat on the bland side with very little in the way of savory or spicy flavor. That being said, the texture of the sausage was really good and the amount on the pizza was generous. The pepperoni was also pretty good, but not being on top of the pie during cooking means it doesn't brown up nicely and it gets a little lost. The other small pizza was veggie and it was also good, but somewhat on the bland side. The veggies give up a fair bit of liquid during cooking so this pizza did not hold together structurally as well as the other. The cheese on both was abundant but not exciting and lacked some of the amazing pull that comes on the very best pizzas. 

The wings were cooked nicely, although maybe one more minute in the fryer wouldn't have hurt. These wing are breaded then fried which makes them slightly heavier than non-breaded wings. The hot buffalo sauce was good, but again, nothing special. 

Rosati's was good pizza and I would be curious to try their thin crust options, but there are much better options in Madison and incomparably better options in Chicago. I also thought it was a little silly to be charged $0.53 for a side of hot giardinaire on a $48 order of two small pizzas and wings. Not the end of the world by any means, but still a little lackluster."}
{"text":"Good stuff:  they're open until 2am on the weekends and will deliver to almost that time.

I know there's a thing with the various Rosati's around town, like some owned by one branch of the family and others owned by another branch of the family....I'm not quite sure how it shakes out except that this one and the one at I-17 and Thunderbird seem to be run the same and have the same food so those are the only two I go to. 

Oh, yeah, the food.  So, I'm from Chicago, which is where this chain began, and that also means that I am extremely particular when it comes to pizza.  And I don't know where the mythology started that \"Chicago style\" pizza is thick crust or pan?  No.  The original Chicago style pizza is actually served on a thin crust and cut into squares.  The secondary Chicago style pizza, that actually didn't really take off until maybe the late 1970s/early 1980s, is what folks around here call \"deep dish\" pizza but is actually in Chicago referred to as \"stuffed.\"  There's your food history lesson for today.

So the quintessential Chicago style pizza is a thin crust topped with Italian sausage.  CRUMBLED Italian sausage (to those doofuses who want to slice it).  And, quite frankly, Rosatti's is the only place in town that does it worth a hoot.  Now there's that new place, Lou what's-his-name, but I never went to his place in Chicago and to be quite honest, I'm not rushing to try his place here.  

So, bottom line:  the pizza at Rosati's is authentic and delicious Chicago-style pizza.  Also, their Italian Beef is the only beef in town besides Portillo's that's worth eating.  Case closed.

PS:  There are some places around that make these things, I think they might call them wood-fired pizza or some such thing?  Places like Fired Pie and I don't know who else.  Some of them turn out some food that is quite delicious.  But I'm sorry, unless it has a tomato sauce, Italian sausage (or in rare cases pepperoni) and mozzarella cheese, it is not a pizza.  Whatever it is may be delicious, but it is not a pizza.  Just so ya know, ya' know?"}
{"text":"I ordered a 14\" pepperoni with extra sauce on double crust.  The sauce tasted like tomato paste and there was way too much even for extra sauce.  The cheese was flavorless and rubbery even though we brought it home and ate it immediately.  The double crust is a terrible idea and was exactly what I expected--dry and flavorless.  We also got boneless hot wings (mild) which were burnt.  Just awful.  And everything else others have said is true--they've got no designated storage areas so everything is everywhere.  A giant tub of ranch dressing is sitting out at room temperature unattended in the bar area.
 Just not good, to quote Donald Trump.

Edit: the management was very good about the complaint, so there's that."}
{"text":"I had never been here before but my boyfriend insisted it was great. We went inside, ordered a pizza and sat down to wait. There was another couple next to us waiting also. An older lady came in and said she was there to pick up her order, which she placed on the phone. She had a $50 and the manager went CRAZY. He began scolding her in front of everyone about how he could not accept bills larger than $20. She said she had no idea, no one told her on the phone. The manager said, \"Well, you should have told us when you ordered that you'd be using a $50 bill.\" All of us laughed at the guy, how ridiculous is this comment?! The manager then said,\" OK I'll accept it this time but I'll probably get into trouble.\" The lady said she was sorry, but her total was about $46 and she thought it made sense, a $50 bill is legal tender. The manager acted like he was doing her a huge favor, was very rude. About 10 minutes later when our order was ready, the manager said to us, \"I'm sorry about that outburst, that was unprofessional. But some people just do whatever they want!\" It was awkward and unprofessional for him to discuss it with us. His yelling at an older lady for trying to use a $50 bill had nothing to do with us. 
Anyway, the pizza was a little burnt, tasted just ok. I am pretty sure we will not be going to Rosati's again, simply because a) the pizza was not that great and b) I don't want to get yelled at."}
{"text":"Love Rosati's since my Chicago days! Love the girl on the phone that took my order! Pizza makes my day every time."}
{"text":"This was quite bad. We received a deep dish pizza to our door that was literally cold in the middle. Of course we had the pleasure of paying $30 for it!

Pass. Better pizza to be found within a 15 min drive."}
{"text":"After my disappointing go at a pizza at Florencia I decided to try another Rosatis pie.

I ordered the same pie- but I purposely ordered thin crust- which is always what I ordered.
Notice in the photo how their thin crust can be held without flopping - like Florencias regular crust did.

Then I noticed that the Rosati pie had a delicious flavor... Don't know if herbs or sauce or what... But more tasty.

In fact, Rosatis is 90 percent as good as Spinatos- at a lesser price.

And the topping is just as fresh, just as thick and actually has more cheese; if you have a cheese monkey on your back like I do - that's a great thing!

I have never been in the store , so I have no clue about ambiance.
I do like  Florencias ambiance ok, and of course crazy busy Spinatos. 
But for me... The FOOD is the thing!!!

If you like Florencia , try Rosati and let me know !

BTW, I always order to go from the Chandler store. They're great."}
{"text":"We've had mixed experiences with Rosati's but the food was always excellent. The service was sometimes wishy washy but they maintained their food. We recently ordered a special with a large pizza, 18 boneless wings, and a 2 liter and we got our food and it was great. We opened up the wings and they were bone in. Now, we really don't care as long as we get our food, we prefer bone in wings so we were just thinking maybe we read the deal wrong. Well, we chow down and about 15 minutes after our original delivery we get a knock at the door. We open it up to find the manager himself, at our door, apologizing for giving us the wrong kind of wings. He said there was a mix up and that wanted to bring over the right kind. We were telling him we had already eaten the others but he said oh that's no problem, we just wanted to correct our mistake so take the wings on us and enjoy your meal! What an experience! We didn't expect anything but they definitely went above and beyond for their customers! The wings and pizza were excellent and the customer service was even better! Thank you, Rosati's, we will be ordering again! And thank you to the manager for personally delivering our wings! We appreciate it!"}
{"text":"I tend not to enjoy writing reviews that go along with what everyone else seems to be saying, but I'm left little choice here.  The Chicago style pizza is good, and since Chicago style is hard to find, it's worth going for.  That said, can someone remind the guys cooking it that cheese is allowed on a Chicago-style pie?  The thin crust can easily be beaten for both flavor and price by Verranzano's or Grimaldi's.  
The service?  Well, they might be better off using an order at the counter and put a number on your table method.  Two servers were on duty the night we went and neither seemed like they gave a damn about doing their job.  Passed us by several times and over 10 minutes before being acknowledged.  Poor management likely here. No reason a sparsely populated dining area should receive this little attention and have this many tables not wiped down.  Also, observed other tables having to ask for their checks instead of having it brought to them with an offer of dessert.  However, this wasn't the case for us, our check was prompt after we asked for a box for the left overs. 
I'll give them another shot for take-out when I want Chicago style, but if they can't find the cheese, that'll end it.  I won't do dine in again, that was kind of sad."}
{"text":"Do you not go to this place! It is probably the worst customer service I've ever dealt with for a food establishment. Even the manager there, or supposed manager had no regard for what real service is these days. Two kids running a place like it was a joke. 

First I was placed on hold for about 8 minutes. In that time I was holding I drove over there to place my order in person. The place was filthy with one customer there. I had to ring a bell since the door alarm was not enough to get there attention. 

The girl approached the counter and looked like she was hanging out by the pool and was giggling the whole time. She didn't know how to even take my order or enter a coupon. 

I ordered 2 extra large pizzas and 24 wings. She said that will be 69.87! I said are you sure? She said I don't know as she laughed and drank her soda while looking at me as if I was dumb. I asked for the manager at that point. 

Bottom line this place needs the owners attention badly. I find it repulsive to think people run a business so hap hazardous. Service and quality is what I pay for and they sure don't deserve my business or yours."}
{"text":"Their pizza is darn good, but their customer service is just down right awful.  They often take much longer than estimated delivery time.  We like the deep dish style pizza, which understandably takes longer to cook.  They estimate an hour or so for delivery, which is fine.  However the pizza normally does not show up until an hour & half to 2 hours.  On top of that they almost always forget our ranch dressing that is not complimentary/paid for."}
{"text":"This place is super clean. Take in or delivery only. The guy with the cool man bun (James)-super friendly and even showed us our pizza before he baked it. Great service!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and friendly staff. Only issue is wait time. I ordered a 12\" pie and it took 30 mins to make and I was the only person in the joint. Much better than chain pizza places."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i ordered a cheese calzone and pizza tonight. I've had frozen pizza that tastes better. this place is horrible and the service sucked too. the toppings on the pizza slid rite off.. so, iif you're looking for anything more then watered down sauce and flavorless crust do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's all about the Italian Beef sandwich with pickled peppers and dipping sauce. If you forget the peppers and sauce, this sandwich just doesnt taste right. They have pretty good appetizers and main courses too. Chi-town style italian food for good eats. :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the family platter for appetizer and an XL cheese. The pizza tasted like bagel bites. The sauce had a pork after taste. It was pretty obvious that everything on the family platter was frozen but the onion rings were good. The service was nice and fast."}
{"text":"One of 2 rosatis in the valley that nails it every single time. 
Ordered italian beef on one half of my pizza, and it was piled high unlike other \"chicago\" pizza jopints.  Love this location, the staff are so friendly! We love you, Rosatis!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. As a native Wisconsinite, I have been used to eating Rosatis Pizza and love this place. 
I usually get a medium cheese and pepperoni on regular crust and it tastes so good, A lot better than Pizza Hut. I have never had cold food from here and its always been a good delivery time within a 1/2 hour."}
{"text":"We had yet another totally perfect experience with Rosati's delivery!! The Italian Beef sandwichs and Mozzarella sticks were cooked perfectly and the food was hot! Driver was friendly and very courteous as always! I've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Great owner and place to have great pizza and beer, nice  place and and owner that cares. Love this place, we will be back for sure! Neighborhood secret no doubt! Best in the area"}
{"text":"Ready great pizza. The thin crusts rays nice and firm. I'm not a huge fan of how they cut the pizza; I'm used to slices. That being said, it's great for a party. 
The ingredients always taste fresh, and the sauce is really flavorful. 
I've only ever had the pizza but I'm sure to try other items soon!  
Thanks."}
{"text":"Out of fairness, I want to say that Rosati's Pizza has delicious food(if you're still hungry by the time it's delivered.) 

This particular location is plagued by slowness and poor customer service. Let me quickly outline my latest experience:

Sun: 7:30pm: Ordered 2 Salads and a large thin crust pepperoni pizza. The call taker had to be told multiple times what I wanted, acted like he didn't even know the menu.

8:29pm - Food arrives, delivery person is cordial.

8:35 - I open the pizza box to find that the pizza is sitting in a greasy lump in the left corner of the box, mostly stuck to the top. 

8:39: I call the 59th Ave Rosati's to tell them what happened. Get the same dim bulb I had earlier. He runs off to get the \"manager.\" A few moment's later someone picks up the phone and says \"hello...\" I ask \"Is this the manager?\" They reply, \"yeah, how can I help you?\" I now have to re-explain everything. The \"manager\" starts telling me that the pizza was fresh out of the oven and that's why it slid, or maybe the driver took off too fast to try and get it to me quickly(an hour is quickly?) He then says, we'll send out another one to you(like he's doing ME a favor.) 

9:05pm: Second pizza arrives. We tell the driver how dissatisfied we are that the first pizza was all smashed, she tells us she needs it to take back with her to prove we weren't lying. She also declares \"well, we did bring you a new one, what more do you want?\" My wife tells her, \"how about an apology, or a \"thank you for your buisiness\"\" The driver was clueless and obviously just wanted to go, we let her leave without further discussion. 

This is not the first time I've had problems with this Rosati's customer service. Other times it's been surrounding the use of thier coupons, both online and print. 

Since they give coupons with every pizza, send them out in mailers and are online, I have, on occasion just assumed I had one lying around. So, over the last couple years have not had the coupon ready for the driver when they get to the door. 

Come to find out, Rosati's has a database on every customer with notes, apparently mine notes that I have been delinquent with my coupons twice! What else do they have in there?!?!

No matter how good the pizza is, we are done with this Rosati's forever. I'd rather eat Domino's than have to put up with this. 

In a nutshell:

1.) The pizza is really expensive. $18.00 for a 14\" cheese?
2.) They typically deliver in 45min to an hour on or off peak times.
3.) They have no idea how to treat a return customer.
4.) Apparently they have no quality control, rush around, damage the food, then blame it on the drivers."}
{"text":"Start with the wings..... you won't be sorry. Then, try their white pizza.....bliss. This local spot fills a gap for excellent chicago style pizza pie!!!! Owners are locals, and  soooooo nice. They let me watch my skateboarding championship on one of their many huge tvs. They also mix a good drink.  So... go...."}
{"text":"Good Pizza.  They have the option of thin crust, double crust or Chicago Style deep dish.

We got both the Chicago Style deep and the thin crust.

The sauce is a bit sweet, but overall very good.  The Deep dish has a good ratio of ingredients and is quite good.  The crust has a nice buttery taste from the pan.  

The thin crust is nice and crisp - a bit thin for me, but it was well liked.  

The fried Mushrooms are great - have them with the ranch dressing.  MMMMM good.

The beer was cold and the selection was good.  Several  TVs to watch sports on and they don't mind changing the channel.  

Will be back."}
{"text":"Just had the thin crust the other day, now I have a dilemma, do I get the deep dish or the thin crust, or do I dare eat the double crust and and to the madness? Stay tuned for more about my pizza addiction"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing......

1st time ordered delivery. Ordered sandwich off their online menu. Told they no longer make it. Ordered second sandwich off the same menu. Told they don't do that one anymore too. Ordered pizza which was excellent, but not what i wanted.

2nd time we phone ordered pizza for pickup.Told 25 min wait. Wife went to pickup and took pizza to the car. Decided to take a quick look at it and discovered it was not the pizza she ordered. Went back in and was told that they had mixed up 2 orders and \"Jay\" had taken Jane's order. Asked to wait while the order was recooked. Sort of defeats the purpose of calling it in, if you have to sit there. They must have then hurried it because the pizza was undercooked and the cheese had slid off the pizza. One end had no cheese while the other end no crust......

Well, mistakes can happen and we are normally forgiving, but absolutely no effort made by staff to try and make it right. No offer to deliver or take a few $$$ off or even a coupon for the next time. Feel 2 stars is generous under the circumstances...."}
{"text":"I would give them ZERO if I could. The staff was rude and told us they \"couldn't take anymore delivery orders because they were behind\".  When i asked if I can pick up the order I was transferred to a girl who said, \"oh no. We are too behind to accept any more orders at all\".  When I asked for clarification as to if it was for the next 2 hours of them being open or just temporary SHE HUNG UP!!! We always have a HORRIBLE experience with the customer service but absolutely LOVE the pizza!! What a shame."}
{"text":"My one star is mainly for the cashier who helped me pick my entrees. She was probably the only thing \"good\" in there. I originally came to redeem the free cheese pizza I received in the mail. It's nestled in the middle of a smoke shop and a Chinese restaurant. Same shopping plaza as Wal Mart.

It took a good 20 minutes for my order to finish.

I came home, unpackaged my food and served my cousin and I. On our first bite of the penne pasta, we immediately looked at each other. 

What was that taste?? 

It literally tastes like he marinara and burned through the pot, sat there for more than a few hours and served last minute. The pasta was cooked fine, but that marinara was ridiculous. I didn't know anyone could mess it up.

Next we took a bite of our pizza. They can't have messed this up right? Wrong. What we tasted in the pasta, we tasted in the pizza. For goodness sakes PIZZZA. Never again."}
{"text":"Wow. Didn't think there was a pizza I didn't like but this was awful!  Had the Hawaiian luau,  in a word...gross.  Cool when it arrived and quickly stuck to the cardboard box.  The sauce was terrible. Only picking of the bacon was good.  
Chicken fingers was more batter than meat.
Ranch fries were so greasy it was dripping in it.
I won't go back."}
{"text":"I worked with Pablo, the manager, to plan a delivery for my son's birthday party. He was accommodating throughout the planning process. As our rsvps grew to 70 kids and adults, he somehow suggested with the perfect amount of food and even delivered it himself!! Our guests enjoyed the pizza and pasta - with many going back for seconds. Thank you for making that part of our party stress-free."}
{"text":"Serious improvements on the pasta please. Ordered the penne chicken something rather and the taste... Like half buffalo sauce and half pizza sauce, very strange combo, very strange taste. Fast delivery, hot food and great customer service."}
{"text":"I was traveling for work and found Rosati's Gluten-Free Thin Crust Pizza and it was incredible! The staff were so friendly and helpful and the pizza was delicious!  I woudl highly reocmmend this palce for gluten-free folks in the area."}
{"text":"I have my red wine and have this main dish called the Rosati's Monster Chicago Style Pizza. I took a bite for the first time and my eyes opened large at the taste of this delicious dish. I have never had Chicago style pizza before and this will not be my last.  

While we were waiting for our pizza my husband wanted me to try a cannoli.  I have never had one of those either.  He ordered one with chocolate chips on it and it was so good.  Normally I don't like things creamy but this cream was actually good mixed with the crunch of the wrap and the choc chips."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly staff.  Had the white pizza and it was most yummy!  We will be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I ordered my pizza with no onions and it was delivered with tons of onions. When I called to tell them, the manager said it was their policy to collect the pizza they messed up! What!? I touched it when I put the piece on my plate and saw it was riddled with onions! What are they going to do with it?! I waited 45 minutes for the wrong order and then I had to wait another 45+ minutes for the right order. Super disappointed in the customer service. It seems customer service these days is dead."}
{"text":"This place is my new go-to for Italian beef now that they no longer serve it at Famous Uncle Al's. It's good, but not great, and purists will bemoan the underwhelming seasoning of the beef. But you can't beat the price, especially as part of the lunch combo, which adds fries and a soda for next to nothing. Even if giardiniera are extra this is still a great value. 

The ciabatta on which the sandwich is served is good enough, but the bread's not as important when it's soggy from gravy. Fortunately, the au jus that Rosati's includes is more than good enough to make up for the underseasoned beef.

Combined with the giardiniera, this sandwich is filling enough that you don't even need the fries that come with the lunch special."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, especially the deep dish! If you like Chicago style pizza this is the best place around here. If you watch sports, they have great TVs, unfortunately, they don't have the NBA package so I end up going elsewhere. The wings here are pretty bomb as well. Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Been ordering from this location for a while and have never had an issue with an order or service. They also have very quick delivery times! They have an all around great business"}
{"text":"My husband and I stay frequently
At the Element. We love it. We enjoy being able
To order food and have it delivered. We drove I from Denver this afternoon and wanted to eat in. We had ordered from rosattis on several
Occasions prior. I called tonight and was greeted by such a friendly young woman although I don't know her name. When your food is delivered it is always piping hot and just delicious. Thank you for tonights meal. We will be visiting our brand new granddaughter when my daughter is scheduled for her delivery on February 5th, 2017 so we won't see you until then. Thanks.  Gabe and Kathi Jomenez"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza since Chicago!  In fact, could be better.  Thin crust is the best; ingredients are so fresh, sauce is perfectly seasoned (we always say light sauce and get fresh whole tomatoes.  Pick up is better is possible but if not delivery is fine, just not quite as hot as when I pick it up!  Enjoy....."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight when it got here we had no ranch for our salad or the 12 wings we ordered ! Asked for cheese and red peppers to put on my spaghetti and meatballs... wasn't in the bag! Will never order delivery... as far as the food goes meatballs were dry and no flavor... the wings bones were breaking in half while we were eating them... very bummed it wasn't as tasty as we were expecting!"}
{"text":"They have since closed their dining room, landlord got greedy but their delivery fast and pizza still amazing Chicago style"}
{"text":"I ordered last week, kind of late in the evening, and had a problem with my order. I contacted them about it and received a phone call from the owner of the restaurant, who apologized and gave me a credit for the problem items. I'm usually very happy with the food so because of the response of the owner, I ordered again tonight. Not every restaurant goes above and beyond to make sure the customer is happy, but I was really happy with the response to my complaint and will order again. Kudos!"}
{"text":"5 golden stars. Wasn't sure if it would be good. Glad we stopped in! Their Chicago deep dish is sooooo filling, ate that for the next day and shared with co-workers!"}
{"text":"Although the health dept gives it a pass the inside of this place is filthy from window sills to keyboards to holes in the drywall it was just icky. The food was as good as any rosatis but  call a cleaning and painting crew stat."}
{"text":"We moved here from the Chicago area this past year. Pizza in Chicago is a given way of life. Rosati's  there is a respected pizza franchise. They know how to make it. None of this fancy arugula and goat cheese garbage. That being said! 
We've only ordered pizza from here twice, but both times it was exactly as we expected and craved. Friendly fast delivery. Exactly as we ordered it, I'm picky! No cheese in a pool off to one side, that other review had me worried. 
I love this area and now even more. I will order from here again. Maybe next time I'll try a Cheef, it's hard to get a good beef sandwich around here."}
{"text":"Father's Day dinner! The menu is great and the servings are huge! We ordered 2 pizzas, wings, garlic breadsticks and salad to feed 14. It was so much food! The pizza is thin, and the crust is crispy! The wings were flavored well (we got mild) and the salad was delish! The garlic breadsticks were really good! The kids couldn't get enough of them! Overall, we really enjoyed our meal. 

They also have a bonus if you order online which is super awesome! You just have to create an account, which is super easy! Definitely recommend for all your SW area pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"ordered a Chicago style deep dish pizza tonight, worst imitation of a chicago pizza ever. worng type of pizza sauce, and little to no cheese. I will try to include photo of our pizza. it you have time google Giordano's pizza to see what a REAL Chicago deep dish looks like."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza delivery a few times and have eaten at the restaurant a couple times.  There often seems to be an issue with the invoice.  Finally, we decided to write a review after our most recent issue.

We used a \"free delivery\" coupon for a pizza delivery.  When I looked closely at the invoice, the delivery fee had been charged, then credited and then charged again.  Bottom line: I paid a delivery fee.
This stings because I tipped the delivery guy $5 because of the \"free delivery\" promise.  

Be careful and check your invoice closely when patronizing this business!"}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times
The first two times the food was decent and and the service was mediocre. We understood they had just opened and it appeared that they were trying to get settled so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. 
The third time on 4/1/2016 was an absolute nightmare. 
We walked in and saw that there were was plenty of open tables. So that was great, also they now had there liquor license, another bonus I thought. 
 A young lady asked us to seat ourselves and she let us know that a server would be with us shortly. 
I looked around and I was surprised that for a Friday night there were only 2 other party's seated. A very large group that appeared to be wrapping up and one other couple in the new bar area. 
I will cut to the chase!
We ordered drinks and our food. The table next to us had a pile of dishes and the previous guest check. We sat there for 45 minutes with the waiter returning every 15 minutes apologizing for the delay. After 50 minutes and no food or the appetizer that we ordered. I asked for the check!
They said no charge for drinks. I left money anyways... 

We live 5 minutes away and we're happy to have a new pizza place close to home. We were very disappointed with the level of over all service and they were not busy at all. The pile of plates and dishes on the table next to us remained there the entire  50 minutes we were waiting. What the heck is going on???

Hate to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"If you want tasteless crust and cheese that slides off the bread in one coagulated sheet order from here.  Won't be using the second coupon.  Regular price xl cheese thin crust is 18 bucks  second 2topping thin crust brought the total to $45.00,not worth it."}
{"text":"The only reason for 2 stars is because I like the taste of the pizza...but that is where the good of the review stops. I have ordered here a few times and had stopped because of price. If there was one thing that was an out of the park knock out was the price...3 pizzas...14 inch...and two ceaser salads (ok sauce, crappy half frozen lettuce) for pick up at $79!!!!! Holy moly....and they didn't put the mushrooms I ordered on a pizza, managers response was I can credit the $2 for mushrooms...holy moly again...keep the mushrooms. We will be going back to Barros literally across the street where we order the same thing and the same size for $35."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta dishes and great meatballs too!  Server's all very friendly and efficient.  Great neighborhood bar and restaurant."}
{"text":"I am BEYOND disappointed. Everyone at work has been telling me how this location has good pizza and how it's exactly like back home in Chicago. They were far from Chicago pizza. This was mediocre. I am so disappointed with these guys... I ordered the deep dish, being from Chicago I know what a deep dish is supposed to look like. This deep dish was like a thin crust, with the crust being 2 inches tall! They gave me an extra pizza for free because someone else at work ordered from here, so I guess they were trying to butter me up, so I order more from them. The free pizza was a thin crust, hm just like the \"deep\" dish. This thin crust was so dry it wasn't eatable... Just no. I tossed the whole pizza. The deep dish wasn't tasty and very crispy almost burned. I can tell it's over done, can't believe they'd send it out like that. Called to get my money back, which they said they'll cancel the charge...(I hope).  Not coming here again. My stomach is already making sounds. Great-"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I love this place! The pizza is amazing and tastes just like Ledos pizza from back home in the CHI. I love the thin and square cut slices so much better then the regular triangle cut! I will be back! This is what real pizza should taste like!"}
{"text":"I was having my pizza cravings...  Read the Yelp! reviews and Rosati's Pizza got my attention.  So, I went online to check out the menu and called in to order a Thin Crust Chicken Alfredo Pizza but to please hold the tomatoes.  FYI, the online menu showed:  Grilled Chicken, Saut√©ed Spinach, Tomato and Alfredo Sauce.  However, when our pizza came, there were only Grilled Chicken and Onions.  Uh... where are the spinach?!  Why are there onions instead?!  

I also ordered \"White Pizza\" or \"Bianca Pizza\".  The online menu showed: Olive Oil, Fresh Garlic, Saut√©ed Spinach, Fresh Sliced Tomatoes and Basil.  However, when our pizza came, I couldn't taste the garlic or basil.  Seriously?!   

Let's just say that I wasn't happy.  So, I picked up the phone and complained about the mistakes and to my surprise, a very nice gentleman who answered the phone was extremely apologetic.  He explained that the online menu for Chicken Alfredo pizza was incorrect -- actually it should have \"onions\" instead of \"spinach\" -- but he also acknowledged that that was not my problem and he'll report that and will get that fixed online.  In fact, he was so cool ... he thanked me for taking the time to call and told me he'll \"credit\" my next order just to get my business to come back and give them another try.  I was resistant at first ... but his tone was so genuine that I thanked him for his offer.     

To top it off, he called me back after we hung up and apologized for being rude and not asking me if I would like \"new pizzas with the correct ingredients\" on them.  Thank you, I really appreciate the offer -- but I can only eat so much carb for one night.   :-)  

I'm definitely a FAN for the exceptional \"care\" that was given AFTER the mistakes were made. However, I'm giving this place a 3-star for now... simply base on tonight's \"whole experience\".   Overall, the pizza had the \"right\" amount of cheese on them and the crust was perfectly crispy.  I just wish I knew how it would have tasted with the \"right\" ingredients. 

Stay tuned for my \"credit\" order review!  LOL."}
{"text":"Our pizza was great and the wings were tasty.  Jeff the person who delivered the  order personable and friendly. We will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Rosati's is authentic mid-west Italian destination, and this location is a unique indeed!. Mix a bit of sports bar with very authentic Italian recipes, and you can consider this a destination off the 101 (on princess road) in Scottsdale that you must visit."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken alfredo pasta from this location, took a 45 mins to deliver which is fine because they told me an hour. When it got here it was warm but I could tell it was sitting there. I had one bite and noticed the pasta had a few split end hairs in it. I was grossed out and threw it in the garbage. Lost my appetite and will never order food from here again."}
{"text":"This was one of the most interesting pizza delivery experiences in that we got a large chicago style pizza that was so huge and heavy, it probably could feed a family of six.

I like chicago pizza but for health reasons, I can't really eat such heavy pizza, so the big chicago style pepperoni was all for my husband.  He was pretty overwhelmed by it.  For me I ordered just a small thin and crispy vegetarian, and I loved it.  The sauce was great, the cheese was abundant even though I didn't ask for extra cheese, the toppings were flavorful, and the dough was indeed very very thin like I like it, and did not get soggy from the toppings.

However, big huge chicago style pizza and my small pizza were over $40 bucks, which makes this too expensive to eat very often.  They delivered it in under 40 minutes which I was happy with as well.

There's a location on Hualapai that is nowhere near our house that takes restaurant.com certificates, that we might be more likely to go visit next time.  Not sure why the other locations don't take the certificates except maybe they have different owners."}
{"text":"Let's start it off by saying this. Why would they put the toppings underneath the cheese? I had to play Russian roulette to guess which half had my garlic and which half didn't. Then on top of that, they claim they're selling \"fresh garlic,\" but I reality they're selling minced garlic that comes in a jar. Tasted exactly like the one I buy from smiths. Pizza was extremely mediocre and the waitress was insanely needy. Like she had been craving service all damn day. Asked me about 4 times if we were ok before the food even came out. They have an appetizer called dough nuggets, but they're literally just fried bread dipped in garlic butter. It's not even anything good either. This place has basically hit rock bottom compared to what it use to be. Upsetting to say the least."}
{"text":"Honestly, I rarely ate Rosati's when I lived in Chicago. It wasn't even close to being in my top 5.  However, having lived in Vegas for 15 years now, my options are limited---especially to what's close to me.  

With that, I'm happy Rosati's is here.  I still find their pie to be a bit salty (I think their double dough is better), but it is a way better option than most everything here.  Also, the Italian Beef is better than Al's, but not as good as Sonio's."}
{"text":"Love the employees - so nice and fun! I pick up take out usually once a week for my kids.  They LOVE the cheese pizzas (it's always what they got in WI growing up) they are thrilled it's down here too.  Their gluten free pizza is the bomb.  Yumma scrumma!!!!"}
{"text":"Moved from California and was told to try this place out. It's fantastic with the pasta and garlic bread!! Would definitely recommend to my friends who haven't tried it yet!!!"}
{"text":"Place was relatively empty on a Monday for lunch. There's a very clear delineation between \"bar\" and \"restaurant\" and even \"take out\" area - they nailed that. Pretty smart concept. I was surprised by how small the place was tho.

I've been familiar with Rosati's for about twenty years and - with the exception of that time my husband bit into a staple in his pizza (Mesa location) have never had a bad word to say about them. (My mother called the restaurant and gave them bloody hell over that...)

At any rate, about today's visit, I am pained to have to give such a low review because of my long history with the Rosait's name.

There weren't TOO many people in the restaurant, despite it being \"the lunch hour\". There seemed to be only one person working there... period. She was definitely the only waitress there. She was super friendly, but seemed completely overwhelmed. 

I got my food in an OK amount of time. The salad came out quickly and it was not only very tasty, but much larger than a \"side salad\". It was very nicely made and they default to \"dressing on the side\" which is nice.

My problem came when my meal was done. It took an inordinate amount of time for my check to be delivered. Waiting for my check took longer than ordering, waiting for my food and eating my food COMBINED.

The value is spot on - and the food was excellent. Truly a great lunch deal. You get a lot for your money.

Again - the waitress herself was personable and friendly but she needed some help, clearly. I don't fault her necessarily, but any good bar/restaurant manager would have easily noticed something like this and stepped in and helped."}
{"text":"Food good, staff friendly but the take out order was not right.  They delivered the right food with free desert"}
{"text":"I would give you no stars if I could. I placed my order online. YOUR WEBSITE said YOUR LOCATION was the correct location to place my order from. Apparently it was not, so after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting I called and was told you called me to inform me, which was a lie. I had my phone on me the entire time, did not receive a call, no voicemail and no email to explain the situation. You website simply said my order was in progress. When I called your associate was rude and unapologetic. 

I will never order from you again. Your pizza isn't that good anyways."}
{"text":"Meat sauce when I asked for marinara? #veganfail Unwilling to bring the delivery order up to my room? #ADAfail The food's good, but if it's the wrong food and I paid for delivery but still have to walk across the resort to pick it up, it's a pretty big problem."}
{"text":"By far the BEST spaghetti and meatballs I have ever in my 50 years had. My son had the meatball sandwich and couldn't get enough. One of his meatballs dropped to the floor and boy was he bummed!!!  He stole my last meatball.  I wanted to stab his hand with my fork, but he used it to steal my last meatball! I would love to have their recipe, but am afraid it is an old family one. If we ever come back to Phoenix, we will definitely order delivery from this restaurant again! Boy, I wish you guys were up here in the Reno area!!!!!"}
{"text":"Late night after work decided to get some pizza at the local joint \"Rosati's\" to try something in the neighborhood. This was a mistake. The pizza was ridiculously overpriced, soggy in the middle and absolutely let down on the late night munchies!!  Wouldn't recommend to anyone or ever order from them again."}
{"text":"I am updating my previous review. I initially ordered a deep dish pizza and was disappointed with the order as the deep dish pizza I ordered has too much breading/dough. 

After a few days, the owner has reached out to me to try a complementary thin crust pizza since the deep dish pizza I ordered was not in my satisfaction. Brian the owner has great customer service! I truly appreciate business owners that care about customers. 

The thin crust pizza with pepperoni and sausage has the perfect texture and highly recommended. I will definitely be coming back for the thin crust and the great customer service we experienced from Brian."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. Got delivery the 1st pizza they messed up so called in and they asked do you want a new one made or a credit we said would like our pizza we ordered so over a hour later our second pizza showed up and the burned it so bad the crust was black. Called and talked to the \"manger Eric\" was very rude and just said well what do you want us to do. Ask for money back said fine and hung up. The worst customer service ever! Stay away from really bad management!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I ordered a small pizza half pepperoni half sausage. Large green salad and 6 hot wings. 
I was very impressed with everything. The salad was fresh with a delicious ranch dressing and Italian seasoned croutons where provided as well. The hot wing were so good. The sauce was perfect not salty like most places and the wings were meaty and fresh. Loved them! The pizza was a thin crust with the tastiest cheese and Italian sausage. The quality of the food is fantastic. I will be back and recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I wish this was closer to my house! Best pizza, service, and playlist!

You guys need a downtown location!"}
{"text":"On April 7 at about 6:46PM I had ordered a pizza (large thin crust pepperoni + 1/2 mushroom) from the 24th St/Baseline Rosatis. I have been ordering from that store for about 2 years, prior to that the Rosatis on 40th St/Thomas (a FAR superior store, I wished I still lived in their delivery area!). at 7:59 on the 7th, I called to ask how long it would take and was assured it was on it's way. At 8:14 I called back and was again to;d that the pizza was not only on the way, but hadn't been put into the oven until 15 minutes prior to leaving. at 8:21 I called back to tell them to cancel the delivery and the charge to my card. It was during that call that the driver showed up with the pizza. He is known to me, delivering to us regularly, and was embarrassed to be there so late. The 'manager', a male who I did not get a name for offered me a \"discount\" I told him I did not want the pizza, nor the charge. We ended the call there, and I told the driver I was sorry, but he would have to take the pizza back. He told me to keep it anyway, as they would \"just throw it away\" back at the store. What he left I took a picture of, as it is the WORST pizza I have ever gotten from Rosatis. When I called back to let them know what had been left, I talked with a female manager who would not give me any corporate or owners contact to vent my complaint, but did offer me a \"Free\" pizza to replace the bad one I had been delivered, and to cancel the order from the store record so there would be no charge that night. 
So, tonight, 17 April, I decided to use the credit, and at about 7:00 called, and after getting busy signals twice, talked with a 'manager' who said her name was Myra. I told her I would like a thin crust, pepperoni & i/2 mushroom pizza, and that I should have a credit. I thought things had gone south on the 7th, but tonight, Myra told me not only did I not have a credit, but accused me of threatening her in order to get a free pizza, because I told her I had a picture of the bad pizza.

WORST Rosatis EVER!!

I wish I could post the picture to Yelp, you wouldn't eat there again either."}
{"text":"It's a Friday night, I get it. You're busy. But don't leave customers on hold for more than 5-7 minutes. 

I called to place an order for delivery. It was gonna big one too. But they lost me after I had been on hold for 10 minutes. I called back to see if they had forgot about me. I expressed to the girl on the other end of the line that I had been on hold for 10 minutes and I would like to place my order. She responded with \"sorry, I can't do that. Hold on\". 

I will never know if your pizza is good or not. You lost my business."}
{"text":"The sandwiches, mozzarella sticks, breadsticks, and cheesecake are not good. The pizza has too much cheese on it and is not really worth the price, and the rest of the menu items are just disappointing."}
{"text":"FOOD IS AMAZING!! 
CANNOILIS ARE BOMB!!
one of the ladies that answered the phone when I had called about a total in my order was very sassy and rude. Definitely don't enjoy talking to her whenever I call. Besides that my family and I order from here all the time!"}
{"text":"Craving Chicago Style Pizza?  Well look no further, just bring a truck to get your leftovers home.  Their breadsticks are to die for.  Garlicky, yet not greasy, small, almost french fry size but light and crispy.  We got an antipaasti salad which wasn't very creative but was delicious.  I should have stopped there.  Salad and breadsticks would have filled me up but we came for the deep dish.  My wife mistakenly ordered the medium deep dish.  Having had Chicago Pizza at its birthplace in Chicago (Gino's or Giordanos??? another time.), I was certain a medium would be about the size of a normal plate and deep.  Instead it was about the size of a large flat crust pizza except deep!  The crust was perfectly crisp and the dough light.There was a lot of flavor and not a lot of grease which is good for a deep dish.  The dining area is small but the Pizza worth the wait.

Ok, we aren't done yet, my daughter wanted pasta so we got her Penne (knock knock Penne, Knock Knock Penne).  Another truck arrived at our table and delivered a trough full of delicious pasta.  They will alter the dish as my daughter wanted melted mozzerella on top. They happily obliged.

So, we carted home 1/2 a salad, 6/8 of a pizza and 2/3 of the pasta for lunch and dinner for the rest of the week.   Did I mention that with drinks the whole meal for three cost $49.00. 

Why not five stars?  Well the atmosphere is not the greatest, the place is small and they don't have as many topping choices as I would like.  But if you are craving good pizza and pasta that won't break the wallet, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Note - if this review seems similar, please see my review of the Rosati's on Chayenne as I posted this review there first before realizing the location.  I left it up because I have tried both places and the quality is similar!

{"text":"Called in a togo order and was told it would take 20min. No problem. I arrived 25min later and was told the order hadn't even been started yet. I waited 35min till I received my pizza. What a waste of time and money. If you have time and money to burn this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"Best damn deep dish pizza I've had in Vegas so far.  I've been in Chicago and have had some legendary pies.  This is as close as it gets to that out here in Vegas."}

They said the girl just left. 7:20pm delivery girl calls to confirm address. 7:30pm I open my door and see the delivery girl  strolling, with my order as if it was hand bag taking her time. Food was warm, pizza tasted salty after the 2nd square and wings tasted undercooked. This place is 3 intersections from my place. Why on earth would it take anyone almost 2 hours to deliver a pizza pie and an order of wings? I'm curious how long they would have taken if I had not called them to ask about my order? We will never know."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I had promised myself I would never ever call this place again.. Randomly I met this woman who told me the place was under new management and they were getting rid of all the horrible staff.. I multiple times had had issues when placing  delivery orders (bad enough to make my husband and I not want to eat their great pizza) Tonight I called trusting the rumor to be correct and viola.. a really sweet girl with a bubbly voice (rhianon may have been her name) answered the phone took my order in less than a minute and I was even told at the end of the call thanks and have  great night--- I know it sounds crazy to be so over the top excited but my prior issues were just that bad--- The food is the same amazing food and the customer service will now match! Kudos to the manager that believed their patrons deserved to be treated properly and stepped up to make the change! I'm an old customer of the Durrango store and will continue to pray they open a bar so I can enjoy my pizza and watch Cubs games close to home- just a dream but It would be awesome because Rosatis is my favorite pizza even when in Chicagoland!"}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time last night... 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 sausage. We were not disappointed!  The cheese is soooo good!  The toppings were generous, too.  We will definitely be back and next time, we're trying the wings!"}
{"text":"I've been craving pizza and Rosati's seemed like the perfect place to satiate that need. We had a promotional discount for a thin crust pie with two toppings. Seemed like a great match for a Friday night. 

Driving up we realized this was more of a joint to call ahead and take the pie home. No biggie tho, the pizza was delish! There are a few tables inside, with very basic fluorescent lighting and close proximity to the register . (There are a few iron wrought tables outside.  I may have missed if there were napkins or supplies there.)

The cashier asked if we had called ahead. (Super chipper and pleasant.) The toppings aren't listed on the wall so we stepped aside to review the menu. The wait time was approximately 20 minutes. Everyone was super helpful and nice.

I have no basis for comparison of a Chicago thin style crust pizza. I hail from New York. I can tell you this thin crust pizza was crunchy and cut into perfect squares and I very much enjoyed it. 

My topping options were equally distributed underneath the cheese. (I went with pineapple and jalapenos). There weren't any goopy sections in the middle where the pie crust wasn't crispy. Yum!

I'd definitely do this again."}
{"text":"Best place to hit after the river, call ahead and have pizza waiting for you. Watch out for the veggie pizza! Great cheese and fresh every time I've stopped by."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pizza place to sit down with a family or a group of friends and even have a beer. They have several TVs if you wanted to watch some sports as well. 

The plus is they offer free wifi!"}
{"text":"As out of towners looking for authentic Chicago style pizza my son & I decided to give Rosati's a try last Friday night.  We ordered a small w/ pepperoni, onions, and green peppers.  The outside of the pizza was well done (starting to turn from golden brown to brown brown) & the pizza arrived steaming, BUT the center was still cool & the topping were even more so.  The sauce was decent, but the cheese was overdone & barely melted.  The workers were nice, the place was clean- I did hear several comments made re how busy they were that night.  The thin crust pizzas we saw through the window as we were entering looked great.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong pizza :("}
{"text":"Any slice w soda... $4 - - works for me!

I've been driving past this place for a long time, assuming they only had whole pizzas. WRONG! To my pleasant surprise, they DO serve slices as well. 

Very large slices, mind you. :)

The pizza man was friendly. Pizza tasted good. I left very full and a happy customer. Great value!"}
{"text":"OH GOD! So, we got our pizza delivered and it only took about 45 minds, which is fine! Until we got the pizza, the driver was nice and the pizza was hot... but when I took my first bite, it was REALLY bad. The cheese wasn't cooked all the way, the crust was REALLY soggy, and the veggies were really slimey and nasty! Not getting this EVER again."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style deep dish pizza, and thin crust cut Chicago style into squares. A little piece of home every time I order here. the friendly staff takes my order and my food is always delivered fast."}
{"text":"Ordered a large combo pizza with a thick crust & received a free cheese pizza for home delivery. Both pizzas were excellent! The combo had pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions & green peppers.  The crust was fantastic and the sauce was the real deal on both pizzas. The thin crust cheese pizza was also super duper.  We are Italian and are very particular about our food.  We will be regulars for sure.  We will try dine in next week.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing &. Tastes authentic. I love that they have a large selection. Recommend lobster ravioli & antipasto salad!! 
Only con, they usually take over an hour to deliver."}
{"text":"They do NOT take Groupons. I repeat, they Do NOT take Groupons. And they make it perfectly clear when you walk in the door. This already threw me off. 

This place is around the corner from my house and we saw a Groupon for it so we wanted to try it out. The waitress also wanted to make it clear that they do not take Groupons. We ended up staying for their happy hour. We got a 10 inch pizza with mushrooms, green peppers, sausage and bacon. I've never had a Chicago style deep dish pizza before. I'm sorry, but never again. They went way overboard with the sauce. We also ordered some mild wings that they said were the best wings ever. I thought they were a bit spicy for mild. 

The only upside was the beer was very reasonably priced for happy hour. Good service, but I won't be back. You guys are called Rosatis yet u don't accept Rosatis Groupons."}
{"text":"The pizza's not bad but is a bit dry for my taste. It's odd, Chicago's known for its thick pizza but Rosati's seems to push the thin crust and double-dough; the latter is like 2 thin crusts stacked on top of each other. They do sell deep-dish and pan pizza, too, which I've not tried yet. 

I'd give it two stars but I also had a calzone that was really good. The menu options are insane, they offer the following besides the pizza: sandwiches, burgers, dogs, ribs, pasta, salads, wings and all sorts of random appetizers like french fries and onion rings. They do delivery, too."}
{"text":"Food wasn't completely bad (because i ate it and didn't throw it away)but also not good either my food was on the bland side so i more than likely won't order from here again"}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Service is not.  Most recent trip, ordered Works with no green peppers.  My receipt clearly say no green peppers, but there are peppers on this pizza!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our experience with this place last night. My husband waited an hour for an order consisting of 2 items. The food was cold when he got it home and we live a little more than a mile away from this restaurant. I ordered the Cheef's Sandwich, which is my go-to on the menu. In the past I always received some dipping sauce with the sandwich. Last night none, and the sandwich was not good. The bread was tough and stale. The meat was tasteless and cold. They didn't bother to ask if I wanted salad or french fries, so I received a small bag of french fries, which I have to say were not bad.  My husbands' pasta was good, but also cold. Don't think we will be coming back to this place again!"}
{"text":"OK, for full disclosure, this is based on the food, which was delivered to my hotel room, not an actual dining experience in this location.

Nevertheless, not a fan! From the get go there was a lot of confusion on their end whether or not they would deliver to my hotel. Well, if this establishment went to the trouble of placing a menu in my room, not just the lobby, but in my room, one would think they'd convey this to their employees. It seemingly took forever to decide where my hotel was and if they delivered there or not. Once it was established they would, we finally got to ordering.

I ordered a basic \"Cheesy Beef\" sandwich, along with an order of \"Ranch Fries.\" Well the sandwich was tender and seemingly large enough, but seriously salty, which was a bit odd. The ranch fries were definitely a large portion as well, but nothing special. It was delivered in decent time, but here's the clincher, no fork, no napkin, no nothing! Come on folks, if you want into the delivery end of things, you need to provide the basics. They did not, plus the food itself was not very good! It wasn't horrendous, mind you, but I'll not order from them again."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Lots of TV'S, 2 patio's (1 smoking and 1 non smoking). Full bar, seems consistent. A little hidden but it's behind the McDonald's so you don't get much noise from the road when you're on the patio."}
{"text":"We ordered a Chicago deep dish pizza and it was delicious. The sauce has great flavor. We will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Ordered their Antipasto salad and garlic knots. Antipasto salad should be renamed olive salad. As that was basically what was only on it and for the price it was a rip off. The garlic knots seemed like they were deeped fried and had no taste. You get a lot of them but tiny bit of sauce.   I would not recommend these items at all."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. We ordered a pizza and wings and a couple of sodas.  A lady that works there kept touching her hair constantly, and then touching the counter, the plates, just everything. It was gross.  I really just wanted to get up and leave but my husband said it wouldn't be right since we would be wasting what we had already ordered. Well, I hate giving such a poor review but the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza, and for the price, I expected a bit more quality.  The wings were pretty dry from being over cooked, and the sauce was \"pasty.\" All and all it was just pretty bad."}
{"text":"Still love Rosati's.  They make a fine pie.  It would be a 5-star pie if the prices weren't out of whack.  But I keep going back because it's really tasty, and unique in flavor.  I HIGHLY recommend trying their sausage.  I generally don't opt for sausage on my pizza, but OMG, Rosati's sausage is tne best I've ever had on a pizza, and by a wide margin.

Another hint - they cut your pizza into squares.  This is kinda sucky because you have center pieces with no crust and that makes them a bit tricky to handle, plus the crust is good so everyone tends to gravitate to the outer pieces.  They'll pie cut it if you ask, do it, you'll be happier."}
{"text":"Not terrible but won't have it again.  Great presentation but just didn't taste as good as it looked; sauce is bland."}
{"text":"Popcorn as an appetizer? Definitely! I stop in to this location more frequently since the Old Chicago nearby stopped serving the only dish I liked and subsequently closed down - I like to think my hex worked.

Huge portions of spaghetti come with my favorite dish, the chicken parm. Excellent garlic bread flanks two chicken breasts, with marinara that is on the sweet side (which I prefer).

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the service can be a little slow for drink refills. I've occasionally had to stop eating for a few minutes until I could wash some of the food down after a drink refill. The slower things are, the more likely it seems to happen."}
{"text":"Arrived at noon, ordered at 12:05. Left at 12:50 without ever receiving our food or an apology. Enough said..."}
{"text":"The pizza is always outstanding and the service is consistently great. They have coupons that make this a very reasonable family takeout choice. Great for Friday family movie nights. We love Rosati's."}
{"text":"Rosati's is our favorite pizza place in Glendale AZ... My husband doesn't like to get pizza from anywhere else any more. Our favorite is the thin crust Meat Lovers Pizza. We always do take-out and bring it home, because the only seating is outside (and it gets HOT in Arizona), but if you like a thin crust (we do) with lots of goodies on it, Rosati's is the place to go."}
{"text":"I really love thin crust pizza so I'm always happy with Rosati's. The sauce has some nice zing to it and there's the perfect amount.  In the past, the cheese seemed a little skimpy to me so I ordered extra this time and it was definitely better.  The pizza came really quick, was hot when it got to my hotel, and the delivery guy was very friendly.  I will order again!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this!
Ceasar salad and chicken parmisian spaghetti, WOW. Happy Birthday to me!"}
{"text":"Never been to Chicago

I love Rosati's pizza because the sausage they have reminds me so much of the kind they had at a family-owned pizza place in my hometown - Pasadena. LOL

Their thin crust sausage pizza is great ... And I love that they remember me as a regular customer"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza.   Been looking for a good pizza place next to the house this one is it!!   Ordered online and was delivered in a timely matter will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Most know Rosati's for pizza and take out, but they have so much more including an eat in dinning room.  There pizza is great, but you also need to try the ribs and fries, chicago hot dogs, and pastas.  They have dinning room specials every night that are an incredible deal!"}
{"text":"The pizza is not very good. As in, just not good. Not as bad as, say, pizza hut, but vastly inferior to some of the other pizza options around. It doesn't taste fresh, and frankly, it just doesn't taste good.

On the plus side, the chicken fingers aren't bad so long as your expectations are in check."}
{"text":"Great people and good food! The best salad is the Harvest Salad! Marcus is wrong about the Brewers, Cubs rule!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that if I receive exceptional service, I ensure everyone knows about it; same goes for when I receive terrible service.

My friends and I have ordered from this Rosati's location several times.  It is truly hit & miss.

Last month, we placed an order for a pizza, fried mushrooms & stuffed jalapenos.  The pizza was fantastic.  The mushrooms & jalapenos were terrible.  Half of them were still cold, to the point where they didn't seem like they were cooked/fried all the way through.  We called Rosati's to see if we could get new mushrooms & jalapenos.  The manager got lippy & told my friend \"fried food isn't meant for delivery or carry out\".  Then why is it on the menu & why do you offer to deliver it?  After 10 minutes on the phone, the manager begrudgingly agreed to bring another order of each out.

Today took the cake, however.  I order the same pizza every time from Rosati's.  I stress \"extra sauce\" every single time, to the point where the person taking the order tells me \"a ton of sauce\", no problem!

Rosati's brought the pizza out & unfortunately it didn't have extra sauce, at all.  My girlfriend called to see if they'd be willing bring out a pizza to our liking.  The smartass punk manager tells her \"the pizza does have extra sauce, I know because I made it, so you're wrong\".  Managerial maturity at it's finest. He proceeds to tell her he'll give her a \"$5 credit for next time\".  Normally I'd be OK w/this, but after the manager decided to be a dick about the entire issue, we told him that wasn't acceptable & another pizza needs to get sent out.

Again, after back & forth with this degenerate, he agreed to bring one out \"only if you exchange your current pizza with the new one.\"  Fine by me, we haven't touched the original pizza.

Needless to say, the customer experience at this place is substandard, and even that is a stretch.  Very disappointed & I'll be taking my business elsewhere moving forward."}
{"text":"The pizza is great but the service is terrible. I called in an order and was quoted 25 minutes to pick it up. I arrived to the restaurant at exactly 25 minutes after ordering. I paid and was told it would be ready in about 5 minutes. Understandable. It's a Sunday night during football season, an extra 5 minutes is no big deal. But almost 30 minutes later I still had no pizza. I kept being told it would be 5 more minutes...the worst part is that no one apologized, no one offered a beverage while I waited. I just sat there. No one seemed to care. Pizza is good but it shouldn't take that long. Especially after I had Ben quoted 25 minutes."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers of this location for over 2 years. It was so good in the beginning. Food was wonderful and staff was great. The last 3 times we have ordered from them, it has been awful. Thier pizzas are falling apart...like you cant just hold a slice in your hand. They fall limp. We ordered tonight and as we were waiting for our delivery, they called us to tell us our order would be another 40 mins becuase our pizza \"broke\" when they took it out of the oven. Ok - I understand.    But we were told that pur other items would be freshly made so nothing was cold. This was a LIE. They just took the cold food and heated it up A LOT. The chicken fingers were burnt and chewy and the garlic knots were sooo hot!  Couldent eat them for a couple mins. 
Sadly we will not be ordering anymore from this location. Sucks.....we really liked this place - back in the day."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Free popcorn. 3.50 for wine. Great specials nighly. Good salads too. A steal."}
{"text":"Stay clear of this place - mixed up orders - unprofessional - bad customer service.  Don't bother calling in an order because when you arrive it will not be ready.  Even when the staff admits the error nothing is done to better the situation - discount or attempt to get you to return as a customer.  

Stay clear - you have been warned"}
{"text":"If you end up here (or live right next door like me) you won't be disappointed. The food is pretty good, prices are cheap, and the portions are huge, but it's nothing special.

I wouldn't go out of your way to go here, but if you're looking for a lot of quick food at a good price, this place will do well."}
{"text":"Glad to find Rosati's open and ready to serve on a busy Superbowl Sunday, for sure, and they even turned up on the sound for me as the game started and still waiting for my order! Service was great, and the staff who took my order and brought it to me were very friendly, unfortunately...

The pizza kinda sucks!

I realize the staff aren't responsible for the pizza recipe, or where they get their sauces and how they designed the pies, but it's not so great. Of course, they probably don't know LouEddies in Skyforest, CA, and perhaps I've become a pizza snob.

I decided to go with the half-half, since I'm not a big fan of a lot of dough, but geez, THAT WAS ALOT OF DOUGH! I wonder what the Deep Dish is like? Ordered the Hawaiian and the ingredients were buried someone under the browned cheese layer that slid off as I took a bite into the thick, chewy crust...not what I was expecting, or appreciated. The sauce tasted canned.

Now, if the dough was anything special, I wouldn't mind the extra bread, but it was just that...dough. Also, ordered a 20oz and got a full liter, which was too much coke and the place was too busy to really fight over $1.50 and get a smaller bottle, so off I went....now that I think about it, I probably got the Double Dough Pizza and this would explain the dough dough pizza I received, since my simple coke order was mis-rung.

Oh well, either no good pizza, or screwed up my order, Rosati's gets three generous stars."}
{"text":"VERY good food. I had the buffalo chicken and it was amazing. Tasted really fresh and homemade. They make their own beer right in the back and were happy to answer tons of questions. Loved it"}
{"text":"This place was OK. Pizza was good. Wings were gross. A little over priced for me. 14\" PLAIN cheese pizza cost me almost 13 bucks!?? dang.  Seemed to be pretty smallish- medium sized...Cheese pizza is a very simple thing. This place is gonna have to lower its prices on stuff  like this before i come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. We had a big order ($138.00). 

Extra large customized pizza - So soggy and greasy that you couldn't feel the difference between the cheese and the crust. It was slop and just fell apart through your fingers when picking it up. 

Mild chicken wings - I've never seen wings like this. They were grayish/black inside and tasted rotten (the meat looked like the inside fat of a salmon). It was so tough, it was like gnawing on beef jerky. We spit out the first bites and threw everything in the trash. 

Jalapeno poppers - So greasy that by just picking one up in your fingers, grease would stream out all over your shirt. 

'Breaded' mushrooms - the breading was not fully cooked. It was more like 1/2 fried dough mushrooms. 

Cannoli's (we were hoping we could at least enjoy these) - the filling tasted like tubed frosting you would get in the discount baking isle at the grocery store. Just 'buttery sugar'.

They were late (1-1/2 hours - I live .69 of a mile away. 

We ordered 6 liters of Dr. Pepper and got 1 liter of Dr. Pepper and 5 liters of Coke. 

The delivery boy actually asked for the tip before he even set the food down on the counter. He said; \"it says you're going to tip in cash, right?\" Just a reminder to this younger generation - a tip is VOLUNTARY. It's not a requirement and should never be asked for. I did go ahead and tip him because he was young, but it really bothered me how he asked for it before even setting everything down (and having me sign). 

Lesson learned. I will never eat from this place again."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Their cheese pizza is the ONLY pizza that my three year old will eat. They also have a great staff as well! I always do carry out or delivery and it has always been perfect!"}
{"text":"I suggested Rosati's Pizza for a work lunch we had and everyone was really impressed. We got 4 varieties of the thin crust pizza and garden salad. The crust was amazing.. flaky yet a little chewy, their sauce- not too much or too little and all of the toppings tucked under the cheese. The dressing for the salad was great too. The man who helped us, without a question, supplied plates, plastic wear packs, and tons of extra dressing. Very impressed! Everyone needs to try this pizza"}
{"text":"Just like home!  Had a Chicago Style double sausage and it was amazing!  This is my favorite pizza place in Phoenix."}

{"text":"My employer takes part in the \"Community Appreciation Program,\" where employees can PURCHASE discount coupons and vouchers from local businesses. I purchased a Rosati's pizza one, which included various coupons, with 2 of them being a \"FREE 16\" Pizza.\"  No strings. It can only be used a specific Rosati's locations. This was the closest one to me.  I used the one coupon awhile back, with no problem. Seeing the last \"Free\" pizza coupon was expiring soon, I called the business to place my order. After placing my order for PICK-UP and telling them I had a coupon, I was immediately questioned as to my address. Why does my address matter when I am PICKING UP the order? I told him and he replied I was \"outside of the area to honor the coupon.\" I told him this did not even make sense as I was not getting delivery, and I was heading to my friends place with the pizza, that is a couple miles from his location. He said he didn't care, he is the new owner, was sick of giving out free pizzas & refused to honor the coupon! Nice....good luck w/that kind of attitude...."}
{"text":"Wont be coming back. 

Taking some movies back to blockbuster we decided to stop by here for pizza. This is a delivery/take out only location so we ordered for takeout. I've been doing low-carb diet so I ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad and a pizza for the kids. It came up to nearly $40 for take-out for a large pizza and a salad.

 We get the food home and the salad looks like a dinner side salad. Mainly iceberg lettuce with a couple tomatoes and a few thick strips of cheddar cheese on top. My wife goes back to tell them we ordered a buffalo chicken salad and they send her back home with a few chicken strips. No buffalo sauce in sight. Not spicy. If I wanted to eat iceberg lettuce with some microwave chicken strips I would have done that at home for about $2 instead of paying nearly $13. 

While waiting for my wife to get back I ate a few slices of the pizza despite my low-carb diet and got indigestion before even finishing, threw up by bed time, and spent the next day feeling ill at work. My daughter and son who ate the pizza are also sick today. Will not be going back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Being from PA, this is the closest Pizza to those we used to get back home. Great and crispy crust. Very impressed. 

That being said, this place is very expensive for no reason. The portions are not great and it's just good ol fashion pizza with ordinary ingredients. $17 for a 12\" pie is a bit ridiculous. 

We also ordered the zucchini fries which were way over battered and there are only about 9 pieces for $6+.

Although I am a fan of the pizza, I don't see my self dropping $30 on a 12\" pie, zuchini fries and cheese bread."}
{"text":"There are alot of pizza options for quality pizza. 
We ordered a pizza and a calzone and were not given a total until we picked up our food. 
$42???   For a cracker pizza and a calzone??
There was a $2.50 add on for Onions?    
What a rip off. 
We'll never go back. 
The pizza was decent, but Venezia's or Barro's would have been better for alot less money."}
{"text":"Best. Chicken. Parm. Ever! Sitting on a bed of pasta, covered in homemade marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese, it is to-die-for!

The breadsticks here are totally addictive, you have now been warned, eat at your own risk. 

The chop salad is a healthy option for someone who is not in a pizza/pasta mood, you will not be disappointed. 

Hidden behind SubWay, it's not visible from the street. Peek around the corner and you'll find this hidden gem. It's pick-up and delivery only, so don't plan on dining in."}
{"text":"I drive 20 minutes just for their chicago style pizza.This place is amazing you have to try every thing. I mean everything!!"}
{"text":"Rosati's Monster 18\" Rules! It kicks every other Pizza Joints ass! Always pleasent and if you ever have concerns or something aint right they more than make it right... Love those guys and pretty gals down there... Finally a pizza joint that gets it right!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  Our food took a very long time to come out.  Three calzones, wings and garlic bread shouldn't take that long. Although the wings did come out before everything else, unfortunately they had way too much sauce, leaving a large puddle underneath.  The calzones were okay, but the marinara for dipping was cold.  In the end I felt that it was a bit overpriced for the quality of food and service. Next time I will try the Chinese place next door."}
{"text":"If you need a Chicago food fix, come here.  The Italian beefs are solid and so is the chicken parm.  Pizza is so-so."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch, and my son & I agree, this was freshest tasting pizza we've had in a long while!  The girls working here are extremely nice, waited on us, refilled drinks, and cleaned up our table when we were done, and kept smiles on their faces the whole time.  Place is kept very clean too.  I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their chicken wings. They aren't fancy but they are my favorite in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Don't ever get anything delivered from here. They can't send any orders out correctly and you wait for over an hour for delivery. I tried them again after 5 years of not going there and first time again was a total screw up and waste of money! This place is by far the worst!"}
{"text":"Twice we ordered take out as Rosati's isn't far from our house and we had guests. Both times they lost our order, the 1st time we weren't told this until after we paid!!  The second time we called and mentioned the problem to avoid a repeat missed order, and they did it again! lol!  
And both times it took well over 30 minutes to get our order and on second time the order wasn't complete and that took 10 more minutes to fix!
What's the saying......'fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me?'  We haven't been back since!   And btw, the food wasn't anything special!"}
{"text":"As one reviewer has said there are two different Rosatis pizza in Arizona. If you want real Chicago style pizza order from one of the franchises on the .rosatispizza.com website. These are all owned by one company and they provide a great product. 

If you go to one of the myrosatis.com restaurants you will probably be very disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here twice in one day, once to pick up a catering order for my work and a second time for dinner with my boyfriend. Both times I received outstanding customer service! When we came for dinner our server was fantastic and even made a recommendation for a calzone that was delicious."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for a while now due to the consistency of the quality. I experienced 1 unfortunate incident, however, the manager immediately fixed the problem and made sure to make it right. Due to good pizza and customer service, we will continue to order from Rosati's.  Their white pizza has a lot of cheese and flavor and is a 4/5!"}
{"text":"Finally, a great pizza place!  Best pizza we've had in AZ!  We tried alot...  Salerno's was pretty good, but this place up on Power rocks!  Reminds me of the great pizza and sandwiches we used to get from our favorite Rosati's in Batavia Illinois!  Good to know we now gotta keeper for our favorite pizza place in AZ.  The raised web on the to-go pizza box (hi-technology) keeps every piece of my pizza from getting over soggy, way to go.  Whoa - kudos for keeping my pizza perfect to the last bite."}
{"text":"singular worst pizza in history.  I paid 21.00 + tip to driver for a medium pizza with anchovies, garlic and double spinach.  There were clumps of garlic, way too many anchovies, and barely any spinach on the pizza.  Also an attitude about it when I called in like \"we'll give you a discount on your NEXT pizza\".  Seriously?  This place is  a disaster.   Don't bother.   I wish there was a NO stars.  Highly rated pizza that didn't even come CLOSE to delivering."}
{"text":"Our first experience with this restaurant was this. It was just delivered. If this looks like a good pie to you, then this is your place. Otherwise, stay clear"}
{"text":"Hubbie called to order the Chicken Delight pizza, thin crust, from Rosati's Hualapai. When he was asking the woman who answered the phone questions, (e.g. coupons, discounts, Yelp \"with check-in\" breadsticks), she was condescendingly answering him. I heard my hubbie asking questions politely and rolling his eyes at me. I said, tell her you don't appreciate her attitude and hang up. He waved me off. His quest for Chicken Delight tonight far surpassed her lack of customer service. 

He left to pick up our pizza. It wasn't ready in 30 minutes as she told him on the phone. He had to wait. He came home and I asked how she was in person. \"Ok.\" 

Granted Rosati's Pizzas are awesome! Attitude is everything for me when dealing in customer service. That's why RP gets 3 stars tonight."}
{"text":"Deep dish was basically a meat pie. They don't skimp on toppings. There was a mountain of toppings in each bite. There was barely any cheese and I would've liked more sauce on the top. The dough was delicious. Pizza tasted good the next day, too."}
{"text":"We were in town for the night. The hotel recommended Rosatis for delivery. Not s long wait, salads were good and we enjoyed the delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this place. The one in Scottsdale is great. This location however not so much. 

Got a pan pizza and literally came out as bread and cheese. There was almost NO sauce on it and hardly any ingredients. It was cut into 4 giant slices, then everything fell off as I picked it up with a spatula! Not only that but on too of this, the pizza dough wasn't even cooked through all the way. Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"Horrific. Ordered a cheef.... bread was stale and chewy, the meat was crispy and tasted like dog food....horrific, the cheese was rubbery... And though I ordered extra giardinara... hardly any came. The breaded mushrooms were soggy and tasted like they were sitting under a heat lamp for hours, the garlic knots were chewy and there was nothing garlic about the chewy bread I received. Not to mention it took an hour and a half when the girl on the phone said 45 minutes to an hour. This place used to be good... I will NEVER order from here again"}
{"text":"We got in around 7 pm into Las  Vegas, everyone was hungry. We didn't want to go to a buffet. We wanted something simple, since we had a bunch of kids with us. When we checked in at the resort, they gave us a menu for Rosati's Pizza. It even had some family value coupons and they deliver. Spaghetti, Pizza & Wings it is then. 

The coupon \"Family Pasta Special\" ($25.99) was for (1) Family Spaghetti or Mostaccioli, (4) Bread Sticks, (6) Meatballs & a 2 litter soda. We chose the spaghetti w/ meat sauce. When they say \"family\" they mean big, large as in a full tray of spaghetti. That was not what I expected. And it was very very good. The bread stick was garlicky, also good. The meatballs were delicious. (A must order) Matched well with the spaghetti. Highly recommend this deal. 

Like I said, I didn't expect the special to be so much food, so I ordered more. 

Hawaiian Luau Pizza, Canadian Bacon & Pineapple. This was just okay for me. The kids loved it though. 

Buffalo Wings (24 pcs) Delicious. Fried to perfection. The sauce was not too vinegary (the way I like it) I could not stop eating them. Yummy!!

Fettuccine Alfredo was also a hit. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy without being too rich. Delicious 

Service was good. From the lady taking the order to the gentlemen who delivered it. Even got a courtesy phone call to tell me he was parking (it's hard to find parking where I'm staying) I appreciated that 

It was a very good Family dinner. Everything tasted delicious and getting a lot of food was a pleasant surprise. 
I'll definitely be back."}

{"text":"Very disappointed in service! As a loyal customer for over 10 years ordering pizza once a week from Rosatis pizza in the Arcadia phoenix area. I recently try to order from the cave creek restaurant and was really disappointed in the lady that answered the phone(MELISSA) Who told me they would not except any coupons..I told her I just printed this coupon from there site specifically...For some reason she must of been having a bad day and yelled at me and said are you going to order something or not!! I asked if I could speak to a manager and she said I am the manager , so I thought to myself this is not going anywhere and decided to order from scottsdale location instead..Found out after picking my pizza up from other location (where they took the coupon from cave creek site)the manager name is Ed, I called back and asked Melissa if I could speak with Ed as she hung up on me!"}
{"text":"I only recommend the pizza if you eat there. It's too soggy if delivered. But it is really good dine in. They also have this itallian sandwitch that is really good too. I think its a little pricey for a pizza place and the service is very hit and miss. Half the time I feel like they're un-happy to see me and I am just annoying them by making them work."}
{"text":"I finally have had a taste of what Rosati's has to offer.

We placed our order for a small 12' deep dish Chicago style meat combo pizza $16.50 and an appetizer of (12) buffalo style wings $8.99.

They give you a complimentary order of bread sticks which would have been delicious had they been cooked more. They were greasy soggy and under cooked otherwise it would have been a nice bread basket as the marinara sauce was tasty.

Our small 12' deep dish pizza took one hour to cook, that would have been nice to have been told in advance while placing our order. We missed our movie because of the long wait. We ate our wings and after the hour wait for our pizza just requested they box it up to go.

The service was super friendly however they would not accept our coupon for a bogo offer they have in the entertainment guide.  :(

The buffalo style wings were very big meaty and good.

The deep dish style pizza was good."}
{"text":"I first want to emphasize that this place has never done what I'm about to describe before. 

I created an account on Yelp just for this review (but I foresee more in my future).

Tonight I ordered a 14 inch Chicago style deep dish pizza. What I got was a pan pizza with an end-crust as high as a Chicago style deep dish but a pan style crust inside. 

The crust along the bottom was very thick, like, Pizza Hut pan pizza thick. I was able to see where the dough was folded under to make it so thick. I didn't even bother trying to eat the edge of the crust because I already ate twice the amount of crust I ever wanted to. 

I will NOT order a deep dish pizza from here anymore. The deep dish used to be great here but I will try to get my deep dish pizza from the new place under construction near Indian School and 36th St.

On the positive, the flavor was good."}
{"text":"So yummy.. I ordered a deep dish pepperoni pizza and some mild hot wings. Delivery was very fast. I will most definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Our group of 6 had a couple of deep dish pies.  Their crust was excellent and crisp on the bottom.  Service was OK but got the job done.  There is an actual bar as well.  I recommend the pizza and stay away on Tuesday nights...it's senior night, and the blue-hairs come out in full force!"}
{"text":"Okay...so I have to write an update because this is just strange.  I have to say that the general manager did call and gave me a 20 credit for pizza which is an obviously nice gesture if I wanted it.  HOWEVER....they actually charged me on the night I ordered and assured me it was voided.  I called back twice and each time they said the void should be coming through at anytime, it should take a few business days (which it was way after a few days).  SO I still have a $30 debit on my account.  I just called again tonight and was told I would have to call tomorrow between 3-5 to get it taken care of.  Really?  I have made about 7 calls to Rosatis to deal with this problem without a solution.  
But hey...they have great pizza."}
{"text":"We love this pizza most of the time. It's very inconsistent. We even called a few weeks ago to say that we had received the best pizza we had had in a long time! I found out that the bartender that we know, was now the owner and he made the pizza. It was perfect. A lot of the time, there is a lot of cheese in the middle and not enough around the edges. They cut in a square pattern for pieces. So the edges get no toppings or cheese. My guy like the edges because they are crispier. I eat the middle so he can have them. But then I have too much cheese and a thin but soggy crust. If they could more evenly distribute the toppings and and bake, it would be excellent  EVERY TIME! But that is not the case. Every time, the pizza is different. My advice to the new owner, is to train his employees the way he does pizza. And then every pizza will be the same."}
{"text":"Chicago deep dish pan pizza that is some of the best in the valley!  Thin crust and double dough aren't as good, but worth trying if you like variety.  Cubs memorabilia is cool on the inside, but please note this is pretty much a TO-GO place only... just a couple seats outside for people who get a slice and lunch.

Coupons are in the mail all the time if you live in the area, and they double the coupon value on Fridays."}
{"text":"Somewhat dumpy location that has slices at lunch, but they don't seem to have them available until someone asks for one (then you have to wait for a new pizza).  Quality of pizza is as good as other locations though.  No dine-in seating."}
{"text":"I love their food and I order from there often, but I swear EVERY TIME I order I regret it because their service is absolutely terrible. I have eaten in the restuarant and it's the same when you go in. Honestly I always order the same thing a white pizza with ricotta and something else, at lease 50% of the time the pizza is delivered without ricotta, however I PAY for the ricotta 100% of the time. If you call back to complain they have an attitude. This owner obviously does not care about your experience. I will stop ordering. Seriously"}
{"text":"TAKE THIS WARNING FROM YELP ELITE!!

If you like horrible customer service, over cooked for pizza and menu items that are never available that you will love this location. 
Inattentive, lazy staff that treat their customers like an annoyance.

Too many negative aspects of this business to list... Avoid at all cost.

Then then salad, which we requested to come out with our meal came out. (That was my girl's dinner). Ten minutes later our pasta came out, we had also ordered a pizza. It never showed. The waitress never came back to our table. Drinks went dry. Manager came out and I informed him of the drink situation and he walked away. I stupidly assumed they would be refilled. (They weren't).

{"text":"OKAY LETS BE REAL FOR A MINUTE ALRIGHT, Chicago deep dish pizza is not pizza. NY Pizza is pizza! This has always been the absolute truth... UNTIL TODAY!!! HOLY HECK BATMAN! So, long story long (get a drink and take a seat I'm a talker) One of my best friends had a bad day. We're talking about the kind of bad day that makes you wish you had just taken out that sketchy dude on Tinder who collects toenails instead, because that would've been waaay better. Anyway, I wanted to do something to help lift her spirits and well my BFFs and I love to eat. Food is kinda our thing. Send me pizza don't send me flowers. So, I stopped at Rosati's because it was on the way to my crib midget's school and I also needed to pick her up. Today was my first time ever ordering Rosati's, because my family is from Queens NY, we don't do Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Well I walked in asked if I could make an extra special order. The gal at the counter was more than happy to help. She was the kind of nice that you only get from grandma's who wear pink sweaters and bake cookies all day. I asked if I could write a note on the pizza box that they would be putting my friend's pizza in and they did let me. The best part is they delivered the pizza to my friend in record time! My friend sent me a video of her crying happy tears and she loved the pizza! Are you still with me? Yes? Good. Well she liked the pizza so much that after I ran my errands I ordered the exact same pizza for my family, because I just had to try it. That's right, I ordered twice in one day never having tried them before. Well my pizza arrived in record time again; Chicago deep dish with Italian beef, mushroom, pepperoni, and ricotta cheese! We also got the cinnamon sticks which they comped for us just because I was ordering twice in one day lol! Delivery driver was so pleasant and had an epic beard so he gets extra points for that. Anyway, let's talk about the important stuff. The real stuff everyone wants to know. Why was the pizza good? First of all the crust was perfect. It wasn't so thick that it felt like a soup bread bowl. It was perfect. The taste was buttery and it was soft not soggy. The sauce was so hearty and rich with the perfect amount of seasoning so the flavor was very aromatic and savory. It wasn't acidic like sauce from a can. They piled on the toppings which were also very delicious. The mushroom slices were large and in every bite unlike that shriveled up crap they call mushrooms at other chain pizza places. The cheese was good quality mozzarella. It was cheesy like cheese should be not greasy. It was what pizza should be. It was a culinary delight. If you still think NY pizza is the only pizza, fugetaboutit! The cinnamon sticks were not like those deplorable breadsticks or fried pizza dough they have at the Pizza Dump up the street it was like tiny cinnamon bites of heaven dunked in cream cheese frosting (frosting came on the side). Imagine if a Beingn√©t and a Churro had a baby. These cinnamon sticks would be that love child. I'll definitely be ordering all my future pizzas from Rosati's. I have yet to find any other place whose recipe is comparable."}
{"text":"Love love love this pizza joint! I liked it when it was just food. You know, pizza & pop! But now that they've started making their own beer, well it's love. Try the fatty slims, a must - great tasting while strong    And quenching. Currently enjoying a growler of the chocolate stout! Soo good!   
Fab pizza 24/7!  And the family that run this place are always super nice and friendly, real chill!  It's a small place so I wouldn't recommend eating there if you're 6 or more. But take the goods home, you won't be disappointed"}

{"text":"I gave two stars because i was starving and ate it.  if you like cardboard crust, square cut, spicy sauce, meatballs that really didnt taste like meatballs pizza  this place is for you!  I am more of a New York Pizza type person so this isnt my place of choice.  Best of luck Rosati's!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for pizza.... not that commercial stuff we all see but real then I remembered this and The Godfather pizza. Definitely not commercial. They offer Chicago deep dish style which look amazing but I went with the double dough hand tossed... not to thin and not too thick with sausage garlic and that amazing spicy pepper mix called Giardiniera. Wow! Makes the whole taste experience. Worth the wait and drive for Good"}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob, and vey picky. Great Chicago deep dish.  Have had a couple of times. Very authentic and consistent quality. 

Got the xl thin pizza the other night  and fed a large army of 17 year old boys."}
{"text":"This location is alright. Bigger than the Centennial location. It actually has sit down areas for 5+ parties and a patio bench area to eat at. The inside looks kind of dusty though.

We ordered to go and it was a decent experience. The girl on the phone was friendly and the amount of time was reasonable. 30 minutes for a medium deep dished classic combo pizza at a cost of $25.07 with tax. We got the pizza warm temperatures and it smelled nice while driving home.

The pizza itself was decent. I remembered the Centennial deep dish to be bigger and deeper though. The pizza was drowned in their tomato sauce. It cancels out the cheesiness and the toppings. I think it drowns the rest of the taste actually. I still ate it because I thought it was alright. 

Overall experience was decent."}
{"text":"Yah, Rosatis is the bomb.  Home delivery:  Pepperoni with sausage and bell peppers, with a 2 liter of diet coke. 

It's the perfect pedestrian pizza.   

We ask for light oregano, from time to time they overdo it with the sprinkles."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff is friendly and helpful. 
The food is great. I can't get enough of the Italian Beefs
and hotdogs. Honestly, I haven't had a hotdog as good
since I was last in Chicago."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I have ever had in AZ...I always order the thin crust sausage and it's amazing every time, no matter the location....I have also had their pastas and fried zucchini and both are wonderful but nothing beats their thin crust pizza...so authentic I can eat a large by myself."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly, they don't have slices but their pasta was done quickly, the packing was flaming hot but the temp of the food was not actually hot strangely enough. It was thinner fettucini than I like but that was fine, heavy on the butter and less cream , I like it creamier, there was too much bacon and not enough mushroom in the pasta but overall Ok."}
{"text":"Rosati's is the best place to order from when entertaining groups large or small.They fed the entire Liberty HS Freshman, JV, and Varsity volleyball teams and  coaches. We couldn't believe how fresh and well prepared the food was. Quality was OUTSTANDING!
We ordered Baked Ziti, and Italian table salad, ( comes with bread) 
To die for!
The pizza's are wonderful and generous with toppings.
Ashton is a huge help when placing larger orders...always plenty left over. I'm so happy I found this place! A must try!"}
{"text":"The food is what you get from a franchise pizza place. It is better than some and not as good as some but that is a personal preference. The help is horrible. The service is even worse. The kids that work here stand around and talk to each other and ignore customers. They have little or no training and absolutely no people skills. Scary to think what the employees could make in tips and how much more money the place could make if they actually cared a little bit. I guess their monopoly on rio verde makes them enough money that customer service really doesn't matter. This is probably the 4th or 5th bad experience I have had at this location. Someone please open a new place out here so they can see what a little competition does to their bottom line!"}
{"text":"I order every Wednesday. Daily special is perfect for my family. free small pizza with an extra large! $20 to feed all five of us. great deal."}
{"text":"I got hooked on their new zeppole and chicken alfredo! great food."}
{"text":"Excellent lasagna! Food was delivered piping hot! I will definitely order fr here again."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a poor rating. I figured what the heck, I might as well try it anyways. I'm glad I did. It was amazing!  The deep dish pizza is amazing and the harvest salad is the best salad I've ever had. I could just drink the dressing. Yummmm. It was so good I got it again the next day.  Totally worth it"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in there service over an hour late they finally called an told me the driver go cut off and the pizza went flying and they had to be remade. 

So here we are waiting for our pizza"}
{"text":"My family often gets rosati's on birthdays!! Their pizzas have always been really good and their deep dish pizzas a freaking delicious. They are really filling. We have gotten a \"meat lovers\" deep dish pizza and a bbq chicken pizza there, along with other pizzas at different times. But those two have been the family fav. 

Never have had any problems with delivery. Sometimes the deep dish take a little longer to make but still, worth the wait. Especially if you're having a party the wait doesn't seem as long. The pizza is good. It's worth it in my opinion. So if you want good pizza go there. Get the deep dish. It's fun and typically unusual to get deep dish. So have the experience."}
{"text":"There was mold on my daughters pizza. I called and told them and there only response was to tell me to call back tomorrow because there was no manager on duty... I left my contact info and was never called."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Madison.
Don't listen to the other reviews.
Everybody knows rosatis is the best.
Pizza,sandwiches we have had it all and its all excellent food."}
{"text":"I found this place months ago as Im from Chicago where Rosatis was started in the 1960s  and the pizza was amazing even as good as in Chi town but the last two pizzas had no cheese and were overcooked and I always order extra cheese ? Well I found out its under new management and thats why the pizza now sucks plus they fired all the competent employees .

I went in a few more times just for a snack to see what the heck was going on and I saw this guy who must be the new owner watching over everything micro managing every little detail and not in a good way ( thats why you hire a good manager ) so this place should be out of business or employees in months .
I dont mind paying $23 for a pie but when Pizza hut is probably just as good and for S17 less thats sad    .

Another not widely know fact is unlike McDonald's Franchises that make you follow everything to the T  Rosati's isnt that stringent so maybe try another Las Vegas Location if your dying for a real Chicago thin crust pie .

UPDATE RESPONSE TO THE OWNER/MANAGER YOU SOUND VERY DEFENSIVE NOT A GREAT SIGN ? AS I BEEN EATING ROSATI'S Since the early 1970's in Niles IL on Milwaukee Ave and the owner at the Losee location before you did it right ! And while I like your added security camera's mark my words as a successful manager and consumer of many Rosati's pies OVER  40 YEARS your doing it all wrong from top to bottom as your making the staff nervous and uncomfortable as it shows by all the simple little mistakes they now make , but the real bottom line is look at all the bad reviews since you have taken over and I could careless about service when I pickup a Pizza but your messing with the food quality and consistency and that will be your downfall !
You said I never said anything which is true but should I have to ? I dont want anything FREE I just wanted what I paid for so if you or your manager were really checking food consistency a two year old wouldve caught this isnt extra cheese or even kinda of white it was dried and dead ! I even got their 10 minutes early so it didnt sit in the heat window but they didnt even put in my order said she was cutoff  ? And if she had any doubt the order wasnt complete why didnt she call me back to confirm it , I mean I order the same thing ever time ? When I came in and then re order my order I even went so far as to tell the Lady not to overcook it I want the cheese kinda white but for the second time it was dry and hard with barely enough cheese for a regular pizza yet alone extra cheese and all the people I told about having a great Chicago thin crust in town has been rescinded but when Im by Centennial Hills I will try that location . YOU REALLY DONT GET IT I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND A PIECE OF CHICAGO IN LAS VEGAS AND NOW THAT IS GONE AND SO IM I AND ALL MY REFERRALS TO WHERES THE BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS ."}
{"text":"These guys are NO joke! 
I'm a Chicago native and grew up on Aurelio's Pizza in Blue Island during the '60's.
This thin crust pizza is just as good, if not better. The sausage is authentic south side Dago and the cheese is a gooey mess, just what it's supposed to be.
The real payoff is tomorrow morning cold pizza breakfast.
Don't believe this Polack, try it yourself!"}
{"text":"Family owned, perfectly baked authentic Chicago style pizza. Crust was perfect, Italian sausage absolutely some of the best I've eaten anywhere on a pizza. When you walk in there's a very good chance you'll be served by the Rosati family personally. Look for the sign stating original valley owners as there are franchise restaurants with the family name but aren't family owned. This review is for the McQueen X Ray Rd location."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering delivery from here. After 1.5 hours I tried to call and cancel (how long does a pizza take?). No one was answering the phone. I tried 5 times. After two and a half hours the delivery guy showed up but I was in bed. What a waste and horrible service."}
{"text":"I am shocked by all the mediocre reviews for Rosati's so I had to chime in.  I love pizza, I've eaten at every pizza place in Champaign, Chicago, the suburbs, you name it- as far as the C-U goes, this is best you can get.  I am only speaking to the thin crust though, I've never had the deep dish.  I have had it delvered and picked up and it is always a pleasure to deal with the people there.  

The last time they had a mix up and I had to wait an extra five minutes for my pizza.  The manager came out and apologized profusely, offered to have it delivered to me and gave me a coupon for a free pizza.  On top of that, the guy who messed up the order came out and personally apologized.  You can't beat the service in my mind. 

The pizza is true Chicago thin crust, cracker crust, good sweet sauce, and tons of cheese. Some of the other reviews didn't like the amount of cheese, but I think its perfect.

Definitely give the place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After a year long hiatus because of some pizza that I had catered that tasted bland, I decided to try Rosati's again. This should go without saying but I've started using EatCU lately and they've got some pretty good deals for the food here. I got The EatCU daily steal with ten bucks of food for $5.. 

I was planning on getting something delivered but the gift card had to be used in-store so I decided to get lunch there with a friend today and I'm so glad I did. The ambience is great! I ordered a lasagna which, as the others commenters all agree, is more than good enough for one serving. The salad sucked and the breadsticks were ok but the lasagna made up for more than the flaws. My friend got a vegan pizza and they were more than accommodating with the preparation and it looked great. 

I would warn you that it seems like the workers like to leave right on time though because I came here at 10:59 last night and they said they were closed. Fortunately Merry Ann's on the corner is open 24/7!"}
{"text":"Always, always go back here for pizza as you just can't get the same quality and flavor anywhere else. I had the large black olive, pepperoni, sausage and mushroom (again) and love the thin crust and sauce."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Chicago so I'm very familiar with the Rosati's chain.  However, this chain failed!  There is nobody at the front desk.  Waited over 5 min. Until the teenager finally decided to come up front to work.  I almost called to get some attention.  I ordered the Chicago deep dish and was told 35 min.  Came back and waited another 20 min.  The pizza was a mess.  Under cooked and way too much sauce.  It was spilling over the edge and the cheese was not melted thoroughly.  I guess they can't make pizza in Arizona even if it is a chain!  Get the teenagers outta there or hire some responsible ones!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Rosati's for my daughter's birthday at the park. Jason, the owner, gave us great deal, and even delivered it himself on Sunday. The pizzas were on time, correct, hot and delicious. A fantastic experience all around. Will definitely be ordering again in the future!!"}
{"text":"We use to love this pizza, past two times it was over cooked and today it was cold. Tasted like it was cooked yesterday. Very disappointed but will not go here again"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 pizzas and after an hour we called to find out where our pizza was.  The manager told us that because we called 10 times he would not deliver our pizza?  This was the first time we had called to check on our pizza and it was after an hour. He claims he was the manager and said he would not deliver our pizza. These guys are jokes. If you want a pizza delivered, don't call these guys."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says this place is the one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas 
Hands down I always get delivery so not sure if they have a dine in but the pizza is by far amazing !! Two thumbs up and they are always on time when it comes to delivery we just tried the stuff crust pepperoni mushroom  best I've had in awhile definitely a must to eat here
Never had bad customer service either ."}
{"text":"Always takes forever and they have forgotten some of my order and still charged me for it THREE TIMES. The third time I called the store and they brought the pizza ... OVER AN HOUR LATER. Legitimately HATE this place. Pizza isn't bad though."}
{"text":"So my bf and I have ordered from Rosati's twice this past week and that is some tasty pizza (Chicago style)! It's not that expensive for the quality of pizza you get. You do have to pay for each additional topping you order ($1.30 per topping), but it's not bad. My bf and I just ordered an XL (that would be 18\" of cheesy goodness), double dough (hand rolled edge and twice as thick as thin crust, but not quite as thick as Pan pizza or Chicago Style), half cheese, half pepperoni pizza and it came to $23.92 (that includes the $3 delivery charge). I'm sorry, but that isn't bad at all; especially for a quality pizza. I'd much rather pay that amount for good ingredients than pay a little less for a lower quality, less tasty pizza. 
The good thing about the way Rosati's cuts their pizza is that you have the option to have crust on your pizza slice. I personally like crust (and Rosati's makes a pretty delicious crust - very fluffy inside, crunchy on the outside) and my bf doesn't. It works out well. 
I ordered over the phone both times. The first time was take-out and was ready in less than 20 minutes. The second time was delivery and it got here really quickly. The person that answered the phone was also very polite. 
All in all I think I've found a new pizza place. It was much better than the other options in my area (which would be Decara and DeLucia's) 

If you want to know the prices before you order, go to their website and go to 'order online'. You of course don't have to order online, but it will show you the prices of their menu items."}
{"text":"Tried Marcus' suggestion, the Italian beef sandwich with barbecue sauce. He also suggested a side sauce which had some kind of really hot peppers in it.

It indeed was spicy hot but played well off the sweetness of the BBQ sauce. Suggestion, use moderation because I believe too much of the sauce could impair your ability to procreate."}
{"text":"Read some not so nice reviews on this... Mainly about the delivery time... So I ordered and picked up... The staff was ehh not too pleasant.. But oh my goodness the chicken parmigiana was SOOOO good!! I will be back for sure!! I was a little shocked it's not a sit down restaurant when I picked up the good but still was yummy!!"}
{"text":"I love a good Chicago-style pizza, especially when I'm starving. I was so busy today that I never got a chance to eat breakfast or lunch so it seemed like an excellent time to call Rosati's and order not just a thin crust sausage pizza, but a thin crust & a deep dish sausage pizza, plus a side salad. The pizzas were both delicious and there's plenty left over to freeze so I can have a slice whenever the mood strikes. The gentleman who took my order was friendly and professional. My order arrived right on time and the delivery person was very nice. I just love this place."}
{"text":"Called on Saturday night at 941 pm was put on hold and when I tried to place a order I was told to late they close at 10 pm and would not take my order . If you close. At 10 then you should take orders until 10. Not only that the phone girl was extremely rude I will not order from them ever again they are not cheap and then to be treated so disrespectfully is bad business and the owner should be. Ashamed of running his business that way"}
{"text":"I'm really happy when I can come into town and find an lgbt friendly spot north of the 101. 
Markus is the star attraction here - he always has a Mai tai ready for me before I seat my cute little tush down.

This establishment seems like everyone eventually dates everyone so don't get too comfortable!!!!!

I am going to have my wedding reception here in a few months, if that's any indication of how adorable this place is."}
{"text":"We were from out of town and had a groupon.  And were disappointed upon arrival that this is really just a take out and delivery place.   Rather than sit at one of their 3 afterthought,  crushed into the retail space tables, we opted to take out back to our hotel room.  Then, DH says he wants Chicago style, looking for a Lou Malinotti's replica..  Ugh.  I was really ready to hate this place.

I can't.   The customer service guys were great.  The pizza was actually very good.  Lots of good quality, melty cheese.   Crust a fair fascilime of Lou Malinotti's.  A little skimpy on the added sausage, but plenty of onion.  Way too much sauce for me, but easily scrapped off.  But I have to say, the sauce was extraordinary - wish I had that stuff on pasta.

Nice side salad with a GREAT surprise of apple cider dressing which was a HUGE surprise and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Fast delivery!! Everyone is friendly and always willing to go the extra mile for their customers."}
{"text":"Okay.. the good first: my partner really, really likes this place. It's the only pizza he eats, and pizza is pretty much his favorite food. He usually gets the thin crust/well baked sausage pizza, sometimes the deep dish, but for him, no complaints. So that's nice! 

The bad: God, I fucking hate this joint. I don't like pizza, but their menu is big enough that when we do order in, I can try and get something new. Half of the time, they'll screw the order up. (Did I want a chicken parm with pasta? They send the sandwich. Did I want the chicken parm sandwich? They send the pasta.) Usually when this happens they'll send someone to fix their mistake - we've had quite a few times where they completely forgot half of our order - and that's pretty good of them. They always seem polite about it and service is fairly prompt.

But honestly the food isn't that good. It's greasy and bland and if I wanted mediocre Italian food, I'd make it myself. I'd say we go here once or twice a month, so this isn't a one-off thing - if  you like stuff that's bogged down with oil and cheese, great. If you want to taste what you're eating, well. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The buffalo wings were great. 

Their deep dish used to taste lot better. We asked for anchovies on the side and they cooked them in the pizza.  The pizza also took over an hour to bring to our table. 

Service is fine."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza , made the original way the Rosati brothers started this pizza business, DOES NOT compare to others in the area"}
{"text":"Not thoroughly impressed with this place, but it was ok overall. 

Yet another review brought to you by Groupon. I might have an addiction, just saying. Excited to try some good ol' Chicago style pizza in this town, but this wasn't what I was expecting. 

The place was pretty dead when we got there. Just one other table was seated and not too much happening on the to-go side either. Despite this, the service was still pretty slow. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time. So much so, that we ended up refilling our own drinks and stacking our plates ourselves.

The pizza wasn't as thick as I was expecting. More of a pan pizza than a deep dish in my opinion. I wasn't too blown away by the flavors. The size is enormous though, so I would definitely recommend getting a  smaller pizza than you would think. I was full after just one slice. We had the wings as well and they were just ok. 

Don't make a special trip out here, but it's good if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"excellent food but customer service sucks for dining in. I sat at dining bar I was not greeted and had to request my drink and menu choice. i had to go up and get my own fountain drink where the couple next to me got served! i think i will stick with carry out. young girl talked high school drama behind the counter almost my entire meal and she handed me the pizza box un built and learned it has to be build each time. much easier to get carry out. Management needs to work on customer service because the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Finally a neighborhood pizza place with a bar.  Very friendly and attentive service, beer was cold and tasty. Ordered the godfather - came with hot peppers that really made this pizza rock. Also ordered my favorite breaded mushrooms served with maranara dipping sauce - yum!! 
Nice atmosphere with several TVs. Nice place for pizza and beer for family and friends."}
{"text":"Have been eating at the Rosati's on Shea and Scottsdale Rd the last few times and they have not let me down with the deep dish and thin crust but it is only take out so we thought we would try this location to sit down. Next time I will go to Shea for take out. 

We had the Rosati's Pan Style and it was huge but quality prevails over quantity. Rosati's on Shea had been the choice at our house but with this set back I am ready to for this price range go back to Spinatos.

Service here was good and prompt but the food just did not meet my expectations. 

I will not go back here but will go back to the Rosati's on Shea Rd"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

The buttery flaky crust and the gooey mozzarella cheese are delicious!  However, I am a carnivore and need more to satisfy my deep dish cravings, such as pepperoni and sausage.  And that is what I ordered, along with mushrooms to top this delectable dish.  But, I was a bit disappointed with the amount of toppings.  When using my fork and knife to dig in to my deep dish, I like every single bite to include some meat toppings to accompany the chunky pomodora tomatoes and delicious cheese, and that was not happening with this order because the pepperoni and sausage were a bit scarce to my liking.  

I placed a \"carry out\" order so can't say much for the service, but the 2 girls at the counter were friendly, and the quaint restaurant was filled with families.  So, until I find a deep dish comparable to Chicago's Uno's, I will be back, especially for their freshly made ranch dressing, which you can buy by the jar!"}
{"text":"Careful: There are 'real' Rosati's and franchise Rosati's -- this one's real. 

I've been here twice now. I've had the wings, the pizza (double-dough, sausage), and the chicken parm. My wife got the linguine with clam sauce both times and loved it.

The wings are totally awesome, no kidding. I lived in Buffalo for two years, so I know good wings. These were cooked perfectly -- crispy and tender. Sauce was good (not great, not Buffalo, but good and hot). I'll get these again.

The pizza is some of the best in the valley.  I'm partial to NY style pizza but this double-dough style is really good. Sauce is a bit sweet, but the sausage is awesome and the cheese is great.

The chicken parm was okay, not great. I'm guessing it's not a Chicago specialty. I wouldn't get it again. And it doesn't come with chips or any side, which surprised me.

The beer selection is subpar. You have to get a bottle to get anything good. Nothing good on tap.

The ambiance is great with a couple of exceptions. The music is psychotic -- 70s depressing music. And the benches are all worn out, so if you sit in a booth or along the wall, you'll sink so low your knees are practically up to your chin. Aside from that, it's a great feeling. It feels real in there, nice and dark, great aromas. 

I like this Rosati's and would give it a fourth star if they had better beer, or if the benches were nicer, or if the music was better. Still recommend the place for sure."}
{"text":"I didn't even notice this restaurant was here until the Italian restaurant next door closed out early that day.  Since I was craving for Italian food,  I figure I would give it a try. Big mistake.

This isn't a \"dine-in\" restaurant. Therefore, there wasn't any table available other than a chair for you to sit in while waiting for your order. It was a hot day outside and we quickly put in two orders, meatball spaghetti and Lasagna. Unfortunate for us,  it was hundreds of degree outside and the store was so hot I couldn't even breath. After waiting (and sweating) for over 15 minutes,  I was getting irritated.  I asked if their AC was broken, and they told me that their oven broke. The kitchen was 90 degree in the inside.  I felt so bad for the workers. I couldn't even breath in less than 15 minutes. I can't imagine working there all day. 

It was not a pleasant experience during the wait.  When I got home, the meatball sphegetti was just OK. The lasagna was too cheesy. Garlic bread was not nearly as good as the restaurant next door. It was soft (not crunchy) and it's flavorless. I don't think I'll come here again."}
{"text":"We are visiting my mom, and she was at the hospital preparing for surgery. She had planned to be home in time to make dinner, but that was postponed. We went with plan B, which was using Yelp to find a delivery for dinner. We were really hoping for italian, and Rosati's didn't disappoint! We ordered a pizza and and an assortment of pasta dishes, and everyone really enjoyed everything! Yum! My mom didn't know y'all delivered to her address, but she was glad to add you to her list. So glad to have found this delicious delivery option!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  

A few years ago I was taken there and I was hesitant but once I laid my gob-hole on their thin crust I was hooked!  My friends love their wings and chicken strips and from what I have seen of their salads and their pasta alfredo, it's SO good.

I treat myself at work a couple of times of the month, usually on a Friday.  Never really crowded and starting to see the same faces (which is always good).

Mary Alice is usually there and always remembers my friends so she is usually all \"The usual?\" to which we usually always reply \"Yes Please!\"

Give it a shot!!!"}
{"text":"First I want to start this off by saying I LOVE ROSATIS' PIZZA, I am originally from Chicago where Rosati's started and moved to Arizona recently. I have tried this pizza from the franchised location at 4206 E Chandler Blvd and have had multiple orders that were missing things I have had.However, tonight I just called and the representative hung up on me after I said I wanted delivery. I called back and talked to the manager Scott who said they stop delivery at 10:30PM, and I initially called at 10:20PM. After talking to Scott I told him my cell phone at the time I was on the phone with him was 10:28 and he told me his read 10:35. He was clearly lying to me. I will never go back to this establishment. 

Clearly this franchise is losing it's brand and integrity by trying to franchise locations. I wish I was back in Chicago where I could get good pizza!

FYI - If you want your food delivered late and not to your order go order here! 

**Order for multiple people so when it arrives you look foolish because they messed up your order.

Thanks Scott for being the manager and taking NO STEPS TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGES. One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever received."}
{"text":"Honestly I have not been in such a terrible situation at a restaurant in a long time. 55 minutes to get food. Truly. Went inside to order our own. No drinks refilled. No condiments. No nothing. I will never ever be back to this restaurant. Ever."}
{"text":"Changing my rating because of consistency with great food and delivery. We've also sampled additional menu items including their Garlic knots, fried dough and calzone.  All has been very good."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst staffed Pizzeria in the valley. It's one of those things where the ONE and only job they have; they screw up. 

First of all, I was amazed at how many staff members were there just milking the clock, not even taking orders while disregarding the line of customers. I wonder what Cory (owner) thinks about that. As I realize this, I start taking a look at the cleanliness of the place, and it was nowhere to be found, the place was filthy. With that staff they should at least be able to wipe the counters.

My 12\" pizza took about 30+ minutes to get done, because they probably forgot to make it in the first place. The guy working the oven didn't seem to realize that the longer the oven stays open, the longer it will take the pizza to bake. He was just playing with the pies, and the oven stayed open about 4/5 of the time.

By the end of the worst pizzeria experience I've ever had, I wanted my money back.... it took them another 10 minutes just to produce a \"voided\" receipt. I saw grown men working there who couldn't process a simple money back request. You only had one job... I feel sorry for the owner, he's losing money to a mediocre staff."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. First I got a burnt pizza that tasted horrible cause they forgot the pizza was in the oven. It wasn't busy that time either. This time I placed my order online, and when arrived it wasn't ready, they didn't even have the order. The \"manager\" was nice and gave me 20 percent off, but what's a discount if the pizza is burnt again. I'll never go back. This place is an insult to pizza, restaurants, and Chicago. The Rosati brothers should and would be ashamed"}
{"text":"Pricey and horrible pizza.  Will not order again.  Papa johns is faster, yet further from my house."}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to Chicago pizza in AZ. Our only issue has been some delivery drivers who take too long but the food is amaze balls and it is our go to spot for pizza in Phoenix. Their wings are soooo good too! Italian beefs are ok but can be great if they were using the correct bread."}
{"text":"Only reason that I'm giving a \"bad\" review is that according to this site AND the Rosati's website, they are open until 10PM on Sundays.  I called last night, which happened to be Sunday, at 9:20PM.  I was told that they are closing in 10 minutes and the ovens were off.  I mentioned that on both Yelp and their own website, that it states that they are open until 10PM.  The girl apologized.

Really no sweat off my back.  I just called Round Table.  They were more than willing to take my business, and it was a great pie."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, staff was friendly, and they had a lot of options to choose from on the menu. The only set back was the restaurant looked like it had not been dusted in a while. All the picture frames and window sills looked very dusty."}
