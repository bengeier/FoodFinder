{"text":"I have fallen in love with this place. Creative and expertly crafted salads and sandwiches, with locally sourced ingredients, ordered at the counter and brought to the table, in an environment that fits Davidson to a tee."}
{"text":"Eating here is like having a boyfriend who is a chef who goes to the farmer's market every day and then cooks for you. Plus, you can't beat the service. And whoever is whipping up their vinaigrettes is a master."}
{"text":"Top Notch Sandwich Shop. Everything is fantastic. Just try it.  I've eaten here at least once a week for the last year.  Get here early or late to avoid the lunch rush and the line out the door if you want your food in less than 20 minutes.  People have caught on to the wondrous creations coming out of this kitchen.  The fried green tomato BLT is awesome as well as the pulled chicken sandwich and the awesome poor boy.  And everyone loves the creative salads.  The great patio only adds to the cool vibe. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Great food with an original menu! Eclectic place in the heart of downtown Davidson that won't disappoint. The service is excellent with a staff that gets a kick out of helping you discover what this quaint restaurant has to offer. I would highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"I am blown away by the fact that not everybody has given this place 5 stars. It's that outstanding.  First the people are super nice, down-to-earth, and more than willing to help if you have any difficulty making a decision on the awesome/funky menu.  The bacon sandwich with roasted tomatoes homemade pimento cheese and butter lettuce on cornbread is simply one of, if not the best sandwich of my life.  The chef told me that the tomatoes are harvested in Carolina in the summer, roasted fresh and then preserved until they are needed for the fall and winter months.   You need to try this place. Period."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least once a week. Amazing ownership - pays attention, works hard, makes things right, and makes you want to support them.   Amazing soups, salads (kale caesar, burata and falafel are our favorites), and the beet sandwich and pulled chicken is great, too. The portions are totally reasonable for lunch or dinner, and if you want a side they have nice fresh sides they make in the cooler each day, or you can get chips or some of their amazing soup. I go through phases with them, but lately cannot have enough of their kale caesar salad with avocado on it. They also make fresh flavored iced tea, and they do a great cold brew coffee.   Love that it's local, fresh and organic food. I am pretty selective when it comes to restaurants (food quality, price and service must consistently be amazing) and I am not lying when I say we're here at least once a week. It is that good, and they are great people."}
{"text":"In spite of the 3 stars, I go to the Pickled Peach often. It's one of those places that you can eat what you want and feel good afterwards. The outdoor seating is lovely in the spring/summer (in spite of a few experiences I've had with bees) and is enclosed in the winter with heat lamps. I've tried the grilled ham/pickled peach sandwich and didn't love it, so my default is the kale Caesar which is actually really awesome, but after adding chicken, it's pretty expensive at around $14. Plus, the chicken is tiny pieces of shredded chicken - nothing special - and definitely doesn't feel worth the extra money. Nonetheless, the patio in and of itself will keep me coming back, at the very least to enjoy some fresh-squeezed lemonade and the VERY delicious coconut monster cookies.   I would just recommend that the restaurant do more to ensure that people are getting bang for their buck - like adding sides to already expensive solo sandwiches, giving full strips of chicken when adding chicken to salads, etc."}
{"text":"After touring Davidson College, we were famished and decided to try the Pickled Peach, despite a long line. You order at a counter, then choose an outside table at which to dine. We moved through the ordering line quickly, then sat down for a fairly long wait, right during the heart of the lunch hour. But, the wait was worth it! I had one of the tastiest salads I have ever had, with fresh mozzarella, sliced peaches, arugula, fresh mint and a peach balsamic dressing. My daughter said her grilled cheese is one of the best sandwiches she has had anywhere, and my husband loved his roast beef sandwich. The food is locally sourced, and the bread all tastes homemade. I hope to eat there again, definitely worth a drive!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food combinations, sourced locally. Always fresh and seasonal. Try the hummus sandwich or the pulled pork or the soups made daily. Desserts are scrumptious and the lattes divine. Every Main Street should have a place like this. Great food. friendly caring service. A must go and go regularly to taste what delicious dish is being served next."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Pickled Peach This place truly adds a unique touch to Davidson. You'll find the highest quality fresh and organic ingredients with friendly people who care about the food they put on your plate. The owners make sure to cater to a wide variety of taste, allergies, and diets(gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, AND of course meat eaters!). You walk in the door and automatically feel at home and are welcomed by the staff members who are prepared to alter any menu item to your liking. What more could you possibly need? Fresh soups made daily, delicious sandwiches made to order, tasty organic salads, a wide variety of side dishes that are prepared daily, homemade desserts, wine and beer, coffee and espresso, tea (hot and cold), and a great atmosphere. All for a great price! I highly suggest giving this place a chance, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Really friendly staff and the quality of the ingredients is top notch. I had an outstanding spinach salad. You could tell the quality of the blue cheese, chicken, avocado, etc was just right. We sat on the patio and enjoyed a concert from across the park. We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and ingredients. Just a bit pricey for sandwiches and salads. It's worth it though if you get the Ham Sandwich or the Falafel Salad. Yum."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Everything i have had here is amazing! But my favorite is the white bean hummus sandwich, yumm!!"}
{"text":"GREAT SOUPS!  Innovative Sandwiches, farm fresh sides.  Great clean set-up for casual lunch dining.  Exactly what is to be expected in a town like Davidson.  We are glad you are here for sure."}
{"text":"Possibly my first and last visit to the Pickled Peach in Davidson. Extremely slow to get carry out order waiting over 35 minutes to get a sandwich. Lots of annoyed eat in diners as well waiting over 40 minutes. Seems to be a very slow and disorganised kitchen. Disaappointing!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a neat little eatery serving fresh sandwiches, soups, and salads along with cookies, cakes, and coffees. Pickled Peach Handcrafted Foods is a simple neighborly establishment in the college town of Davidson, NC.  Dora here. I love this little community where colorful main street shop windows invite you to wander in and browse, where people stop to chat as if they've been friends forever, and where sitting outside and lingering over coffee or lunch seems the most natural thing to do on a Sunday afternoon. The Pickled Peach is tucked into the back of a building, one of those places that draws you in with their covered (and heated, if necessary) patio. Or, if you prefer, you can sit outside and soak in the sun and fresh air. Their small inside boasts a few bar stools as well, but we noticed that most everybody ordered at the counter and then meandered out to the deck. Such a relaxing, comfortable vibe!  For my lunch, I chose the Cornmeal Fried Shrimp sandwich with butter lettuce on a long roll. The large, perfectly-executed shrimp combined flawlessly with the spicy mayo, greens and the crispy roll.  The Sweet Potato salad, roasted sweet potatoes, peashoots, walnuts, lemon zest, and a mustard vinaigrette, zinged with an interesting blend of flavors.  Dora here. I agree. First time ever eating that combo, but it worked. The citrus taste gave it a light, fresh flavor and the greens added texture to the soft sweet taters. Different, in a good way.    The Slow Braised and Pulled Chicken sandwich. What can I say? This sandwich had my name written all over it! lol. Pulled chicken with just enough ginger and apple cider in the slaw to whisper that it was there. OH MY YUM! Delicious!!    And we couldn't resist sharing the Coconut Chewie Cookie. Check out the size of this monster cookie! Tell me you could pass by that huge chunk of sweetness?:) BTW, this restaurant (actually, most restaurants in this community) isn't into artificial annnnyyyyything, so if you prefer a particular brand of sweetener, bring your own.  Try to pass by this huge chunk of sweetness, I dare you! (Coconut Chewie Cookie)  What features draw you in to a restaurant?  No debate here. Five forks out of five for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Gluten free options promised, so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado.   Large portion--very delicious.  5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon. Lots of seating outside on the covered patio.  Their parking fills quickly, but plenty of options on street or at the Municipal Bldg."}
{"text":"The staff was so attentive and welcoming and the food was fantastic. The dishes are fresh and full of personality. Love eating on the porch."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, service and atmosphere. I had the shaved beat sandwich with goat cheese. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the roast beef with horseradish sauce and arugula sandwich. The sauce was amazing and definitely carried a great punch! Sat on the patio. Cute, local place in davidson. Love it!"}
{"text":"The Pickled Peach is adorable. They have a small store and a large, peaceful patio. You order your food inside and, weather permitting, you take a seat outside and have your food brought out here. They have a stellar selection of baked goods, as well as made to order sandwiches and salads. I got a beet goat cheese sandwich and it was so so good. Thinly sliced beets, goat cheese, balsamic - delectable. I also got a \"granola bar\" which was so fresh and yummy. I highly recommend winding down your weekend at the Pickled Peach, or just popping in for coffee and a treat."}
{"text":"My family loves the Pickled Peach!  We love the meatball sandwich, shrimp sandwich and white bean hummus with avocado grilled sandwich.  Sides are great and cookies are delish (especially choc chip with dried cherries!)"}
{"text":"We love Pickled Peach!! I am not a big sandwich person, but I love the options they have, especially the beet, arugula, and goat cheese sandwich. The soups we have tried are delicious, desserts yummy, and the cappuccino is amazing. They have become one of my favorite lunch spots in the area."}
{"text":"The pickled Peach reminds me of farm to table restaurant but without all the crazy pomp and circumstance of going to a sit down farm to table restaurant. The food is excellent always fresh and really well thought out as far as flavor profiles. I really like how you can see where all the ingredients are from. My wifes go to is the salad with Burrata and I am all about trying something different every time we go there. They have the best chocolate chunk cookies too. They have a good but small selection of beers so you can make it a nice dinner spot and sit out side in the back and just enjoy a nice quiet and well made dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"LOVED our vegetarian soups and sandwiches, the dark chocolate chunk and cherry cookie. The dogs were welcome on the heated patio, service was friendly as were the folks at the next table."}
{"text":"Easily our favorite place to hangout. Feels like home with much better beer and wine. The food is super fresh, and changing daily. Travis is amazing. He truly understands what customer service is."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for a deliciously prepared meal. Had the pulled beef with a side of curry squash and apple soup. First the roll bread was heated nicely for the sandwich, the crust was crunchy but soft inside making for a really nice bite. The flavor from the pulled beef was well balanced with the cucumber and pickled veg. The soup was just right in taste, not over strong with the curry and a slightly sweet undertone with the apple.   An excellent spot for lunch ... we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cute place for sandwiches, wraps, soup and deli items. They also have a great selection of craft beers and local wines.   I tried the \"Bacon\" sandwich...bacon, fried green tomato and lettuce on grilled sourdough. Lots of flavor and they use mostly local ingredients. I also had a cup of the roasted red pepper soup. Also great flavor and went well with the toasted sandwich!   Will definitely come back when I'm in Davidson again. Next time I'll try the baked goods and pick up a few deli items to go...the watermelon, blueberry salad looked great!"}
{"text":"Lovely little cafe in downtown Davidson. It's small inside, but plenty of room on its cute patio, half of which is covered and half exposed. They have local products and a chalkboard stating their farmers and producers, which I always love. You place your order and they bring it out to you. Aside from sandwiches, salads and soups, they also have delicious baked goods (cookies, brownies, bars and ice cream sandwiches). The oatmeal cookie sandwich is fantastic, I love how the cookies stay chewy and soft.  I tried the falafel salad. It only comes with two falafels, but they are tasty. You also get some Pita chips and a tzatziki dip. I'd recommend adding something to it since you're not getting a lot of protein. Love that they also have spin drift drinks! I'll have to try a latte next time. Love this little spot though, can't wait to try More."}
{"text":"It's good food, but the prices are just insane. For a cup of soup, a sandwich, and a drink, I paid $18. This is straight up highway robbery. I won't be eating here again unless they lower the prices. Also the selection is pretty slim."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, and that has fast become one of my favorite places for lunch! They have salads and sandwiches, all fresh, and all gorgeous in presentation. You order at the front, and then your food is delivered to the outdoor patio. Love love live!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed having their pulled chicken sandwich (simply amazing) and spinach salad. The shrimp sandwich was just so so. The service and setting were all excellent. We would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant! We were on a long road trip with 3 kids and 4 adults and we're happy to find this place. Sitting outside under the canopy was perfect. I had the falafel salad that came with a cucumber side. Both were delicious, light but filling. My husband enjoyed his meatball sandwich. One of the kids had a side of fruit and I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the bland melon cocktail you'd get at most restaurants - it was freshly sliced peaches (I think it was a whole peach) and huge slices of watermelon. We all loved the cherry, chocolate cookie. Service was quick and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have a great outdoor area for larger groups, and a nice wine and beer selection. They're food is what made it for me. I had the pulled chicken sandwich which was amazing, and my boyfriend had the ham sandwich which was also excellent. They also let you taste test the soups they have, so ask for that if you're interested. Would definitely come back when in the area!!"}
{"text":"It's a little confusing when you enter for the first time but that don't be a problem on future visits and it's so good I will be sure you will back especially if you have reasons to visit quaint attractive and fun Davidson.   This place is really good and attempts to source locally and organically to the greatest extent they can.   You place your order towards the back left hand side of the counter prior to finding your seat. It's a relatively small eclectic menu, a few items, including their house made soups of the day.  They also have specials of the day.  The good is very tasteful and leans towards the healthy.  They have good drinks and sides.  The desserts are top notch ,  and the service is very good .  There is an attached screened in area with lots of seating!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a birthday lunch with my daughters.  Such a cute place!  We had a fun time.  Food was good...especially the BLT on cornbread!  Salads were delicious, and there was a number of beers and wine to choose from.  Oh and the birthday whoopi pie was not too shabby either!  Would go back here anytime!"}
{"text":"We attended the Arts in the Park today and someone had recommended this new restaurant.  Clearly they were not ready for the stream of lunchtime patrons from the show and standing in the crowded line was not pleasant.  I saw several people I knew, but didn't get a chance to ask about the food before I ordered the roast beef sandwich.  It could not have been worse.  The bread was doughy like Wonder Bread and there was far too much of it.  The beef was so dry as to be described as desiccated.  The greens were dry and tasted unwashed.  The presentation was as bad;  a plain sandwich on a small cookie sheet with no utensils to cut it in half, or a side to help wash the dryness away.  Once the lunch was over, we all compared notes about the food.   One sandwich came on cornbread which completely fell apart when it was picked up because it was so dry.  Another bad tasting sandwich.  The prices are too expensive for what you get, but the ice-tea was excellent.  Beyond going back for a take-out ice-tea, I won't be eating there or recommending the place.  Why didn't I complain?  They were in way over their heads, and it wouldn't have taken a rocket scientist to see, even from a distance, that the beef they served was inedible.  But they served it anyway and lost several future customers in the process."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in The Pickled Peach tonight before dinner thinking it was a country store. When we realized it was a restaurant, we were just about to leave when the owner poured us a taste of wine. He proceeded to tell us about their picked peaches and then casually brought out a DELICIOUS prosciutto and Brie sandwich for us to sample with yet another taste of wine...as if the first wasn't surprising enough! This place, the owners, and employees have small town charm and hospitality in all the right ways. We will definitely be back! Thank you, Pickled Peach, for a lovely date night surprise!"}
{"text":"Yes yes and yes! I stumbled into this place with my husband and their sandwiches are all I've been dreaming about since. They have a cool and casual vibe and I can't wait to go back to get lunch!"}
{"text":"New in 2014- a fancy sandwich shop with amazing combinations of fresh ingredients. I had the meatball sub and it was very good- amazing seasoning on the meat and the marinara sauce. Melted mozerella on a toasted roll were extra treats! My wife ordered and ate the signature sandwich- ham with pickled peaches and brie on sourdough. She enjoyed it and said the flavor combinations of sweet and bitter and salty were nearly perfect....    Price wise they may be able to get the wealthy, but it is very overpriced. Sandwiches are $8-$10 each and then you pay extra for sides and drinks. It's unique in it's offering but the prices are very high."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in Davidson! They have three wonderful soups everyday that always seem different. I love how inventive and flavorful the sounds area. As others have mentioned, the portions are on the smaller side but it's what we should be eating. We are just so used to being overloaded with food at restaurants. I always leave the Pickled Peach feeling good about what I've eaten. Hoping they expand to Huntersville soon :)"}
{"text":"I had travelled the far distance to Davidson to eat brunch, but after brunch I needed dessert.  Whats a girl to do?  I wondered the street of Davidson \"downtown\" and almost decided upon ice cream when I saw the Pickled Peach sign.  I thought I'd wander in.  When I entered, the hippie immediately hit me.   The sign above the kitchen outlined where each of their ingredients was sourced from, and the display of food on the counter contained... BROWNIES!  Exactly what I was looking for.  I ordered my brownie, requesting a non-corner piece.  Paid the monies and walked out.  Oh my.  That brownie was delicious and chocolatey.  It was the best decision ever.    I didn't get to try out the other foods, but based on that brownie, they should be amazing."}
{"text":"Service was ridiculously slow and workers are rude. 10/10 DO NOT drink their coffee potent tasting. Food is good but if you're looking for a large affordable meal this is not the place."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Usually get the kale salad with a soup of the day. Nice atmosphere as well! Some of the staff are not on the friendly side which is the only down fall."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!   Right across from my favorite coffee shop \"The Summit\".  It was SOOOOOO busy!!!! For a Tuesday, it was insane.  I can see why though. The food was amazing. I the roast beef, and it was incredible! The horse radish sauce on it was so creamy.    I also had the Mayan coffee, but it was just okay. It had cayenne pepper, chia, and vanilla. It was way to spicy for me!   My wife had a blueberry coffee which was pretty tasty! But I'd still say if your looking for coffee, the summit is the place to go."}
{"text":"Bakery items--vegan, cookies and granola not at all enjoyable. 3 of us had average salads, 2 sandwiches which had dry, flavorless rolls with very little filling. For the price I expect A LOT more. Go elsewhere. Very limited menu also not  a good thing."}
{"text":"I really love this place for lunch.  Fresh salads, soups from scratch and delicious sandwiches right in the middle of downtown Davidson...  If I'm going light, the spinach salad with cranberries and walnuts is great, and paired with a soup it's really all I need!  Seating can sometimes be a challenge as it can get quite crowded at lunch, but they've done a good job expanding.  I also appreciate that--since all seating is \"outside\"--they've done a nice job heating the space on cool rainy days like today."}
{"text":"Freshness personified! I could talk about this place forever! Tucked away in a little corner lies this gem Of a place thats really cool! The food they serve is not a regular restaurant food! You see why they say its hand crafted after all! You gotta try this place out if you ever happen to be around in the area! This place happened to us- we were lost hungry and yelped and got lucky to have spotted this gem! Must try place esp in the evening its just so beautiful-you will fall in love with the place! Their soups and sandwiches were amazingly delicious. I felt the portion was small when i first saw it probably because of the fact that i was very hungry but it was just perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Staff is super friendly. Food is delicious. Lots of gluten free options. Even cookies and brownies ! Love pickled peach"}
{"text":"We came here not expecting much. We were very surprised. The food is healthy and fresh. I highly recommend the beef sandwich. Very tasty."}
{"text":"What a gem in the cute town of Davidson!  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table when it's ready.  All the drinks are natural, and all the food is farm to table. They have outside seating on their patio, but even on a busy day we found a table pretty easily.  I had the Halloumi salad, which was one of the most fresh salads I have had in a long time.  I just wish it had more cheese... but I am a bit of a glutton. My son got the kids grilled cheese and I have to say I was kind of jealous, it was delicious!  The portions are not huge, but are perfectly satisfying.  The service was very good.  Can't wait to go back to try something else on their delicious salad/sandwich centric menu."}
{"text":"My go-to lunch spot.  Sandwiches never fail me!   For first-timers: get the ham sandwich."}
{"text":"Farm to Fork but Service Could be Better  First  thing that you notice when you walk in the the large blackboard hung up on the wall with all of the names of farms to provide the ingredients for you meal. Nice touch.  Biggest problem with the restaurant is lack of service to the point of even getting someone to answer a basic quesiton.  It was our first time there Sunday before last and my wife wanted to know what the soups were and could not get anyone to answer that basic question. Not that they were that busy but they were just not involved with the clientle.  I ordered a Green Tomato and Pork Belly of Fresh Baked Sour Dough that was very good. My wife started with lukewarm Lentil Soup that was very bland. Her salad was better but not outstanding.  No indoor seating to speak of so everyone sat on the porch.  The porch was very nice but the temperature was only in the 80's so probably not that comfortable on hot humid days or January could be a trial.  We'll try again in the near future.  Food was good and the concept is very good but the service aspect needs to be workeed on."}
{"text":"The people are super nice, the place looks awesome. I wanted to love this place.  I wanted it to be a 5 starer & I wanted to leave craving more. It was good but did not earn a spot in the weekly dining out rotation.  I adore the style. I appreciate the simplicity of the menu. I was hoping for a heartier salad for the $9 price tag. Before arriving not knowing anything but what I had heard (\"new sandwich place\" and \"it's really healthy\") I was really hoping for a vegetarian sandwich beyond grilled cheese, but in the South this is hard to come by everywhere - grilled cheese was the choice here as well. We opted for salad. The salad tasted like the dressings were prepared in house, mine was great, vinaigrette. Daughter's caesar tasted like a legit caesar dressing (including the strong anchovy or some kind of fish taste) I didn't appreciate that.  The spring mix salad I had seemed a little bag salad-ish to me (had a few of those lettuce pieces that make you think ewww and push them to the side). I was hoping for farmer market fresh (it's the season purhaps). 5 times out of 10 I will eat mediocre food for good ambiance. This food is better than mediocre, and the ambiance is great, but I really wanted to be wowed.   For 3 of us it was $41 before tip (I drank water & it was a good refreshing glass of what seemed like filtered water i.e. it tasted like water - no funky water here, love that!). 2 iced teas, 3 brownies & 3 salads (salad was bigger than a side salad but not as large as what I want to consume for lunch or dinner - it's just lettuce people, yes I want more). Granted I splurged and for $1.50 added avocado to my salad (you can take the girl out of California, but you can't take the California out of the girl....or something like that). Overall it just seemed pricy. However, if during the correct season the prices remain & the food is all local farm fresh - I would be glad to pay those prices.  The thing that disappointed most was not having a great vegetarian option beyond salad or grilled cheese.   And the brownie was delish!  I will eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is great- passing through going to Charlotte and stumbled upon this gem.  I got the falafel salad and it was so fresh and tasty! The gluten/vegan free pastries were very delicious.  I actually ate here 3 more times during my stay in Charlotte- it was only a 15 min drive from my Airbnb."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for a tasty and healthy lunch. Fresh ingredients, interesting salad and sandwich options, and iced tea that always hit the spot. Baked goods are amazing, too!"}
{"text":"I was visiting this area for work and myself and a colleague wanted something quick but tasty! This place did not disappoint! Lots of homemade baked goods greet you right away.  They have gluten-free items from another bakery as well.   The staff is very helpful and friendly.  For newcomers, they guide you through the ordering process. They are also very patient with questions.   Highlight: the house made, delicious soups! You grab a clean, one-time use spoon to give their daily soups a taste.  They were all good!  I ordered the tomato and it was savory, robust but not overpowering! It paired well with my toasted sandwich, great for dipping.   We sat in a enclosed patio table area. It was a beautiful day and that atmosphere topped off the lunch.   All the elements combined, made for a really nice, relaxing and delicious lunch. I would stop here again if I ever make my way back to this area."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally came here. It's a gem. Took my boys here for lunch when they had 1/2 a day of school. Ample seating. Pleasant atmosphere. Gluten free options. (The brownies) YUM! We'll definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"I love the Pickled Peach! The food is all farm to table, and there is actually a chalkboard that tells you which farm produced each ingredient in every option. I highly recommend the ham/brie/pickled peach sandwich. It's goey and has the savory sweet complex flavor that makes you wish you could rewind time and eat it again when you've finished. Their homemade soups and salads are always delicious, and they offer vegetarian and gluten free options. Located in Davidson, it's a quaint lunch spot with a big flavor punch."}
{"text":"The ham sandwich with brie and pickled peach on challah bread  was super fantastic! One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. However, the price for the 2 of us to eat was very high, so that's why I gave them 4 out of 5 stars. It was $26 for 2 sandwiches, a bag of chips and 2 bottled drinks, & tip. For that price, I should enjoy it a lot (and did)!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Wow, this place was such a cool find. All the food is locally sourced and menu items change daily. We tried the sweet potato bacon soup (heavenly), ham, Brie, and pickled peach sandwich on grilled challah bread (couldn't stop eating even though I was full with half), turkey, avocado on sourdough (yum), and quinoa with sweet potatoes and cranberries (so favorful)! To top it off we had the oatmeal raisin whoopie pie and holy smokes! That filling was for sure homemade. It tasted like a marshmallow-meringue. The staff were so friendly and very proud of the food they serve. We sat at a nice little outdoor table that was decorated with a small vase of wildflowers and honeysuckle! Seating indoors is all in a barstool format. The seating outdoors was partially enclosed but looks like it can be opened up all the way first sunny days. They also had a heated lamps for your comfort."}
{"text":"Only clean food in the area. We moved last year from a larger metropolitan area that had many restaurants that had clean fresh non-GMO organic choices. Sadly, in this beautiful area there are almost none. There are wonderful people here who deserve good health. People, real food costs money to grow and to have fresh daily. If u are complaining about prices, clearly you're not educated about what it costs to actually farm ethically and safely, and to bring to you food that is healthy for you and not covered with toxins and pesticides or the poorest cheapest quality. You can go to Chick-fil-A  to shove disease tortured medicated chicken in your mouth and stuff your distended stomach with very poor food of low nutritive value and pay a very low price. Or you can make a conscious choice about your health and choose to eat foods that are clean and meticulously prepared, like amazingly fabulous spinach salad with a dressing my five-year-old drinks if I don't finish it, or hot fresh nourishing soups. There are ab fabulous in-house baked pastries - my favorite is the huge gluten-free brownie. The food here is delicious. Educate yourself, make choices and if you can afford to go out to eat, eat as clean as you can afford. Otherwise cook at home. We see many ill effects of the toxins were putting in our body from foods. Cancers, asthma, skin problems, digestive problems... Not just adults, but many children have these illnesses! You are what you eat. Thank goodness there is at least one restaurant in the area where you can go out to eat and know what you're getting is clean."}
{"text":"I work in Davidson and the restaurant choices have been boring for awhile because I have been to all of them and wanted something new.  So I was excited to see a new place come in, I tried the place and I could make the sandwich I got there at home.  I got the turkey, it was good but like I said, I could make the same thing at home, just nothing that stood out about it for me.  Also, disappointed that they don't have any sides with their meals.  The turkey sandwich is $8.50 and for $8.50 you get a sandwich, no chips, no pasta or potato salad, nothing.  It's just a really eh, kinda place, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I thought the servings were small and pricey.  I never even knew this place existed.  tough location to find parking for.  i would not go back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! I had the falafel salad and it was delicious! They have interesting takes on some baked goods, but other than that very cute place with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I can't really say anything bad about this place. I love the face it's a farm to table place. The food is excellent! I haven't had a bad meal there yet. The brownies are to die. It's well worth the drive to go there for sure. Everyone that I have taken love this place."}
{"text":"OMG. Love this spot. For first timers it's a little confusing. Grab a menu, stand in line, place order at cashier. If you are staying give your name and find a seat. They come out and tell your name and bring over the food. Farm fresh, delicious, unique. Soups, salads, and sandwiches are all A+. Great beverage selection."}
{"text":"What a darling little place! Another Friday lunch excursion and another winner!   The restaurant has a deli counter set up, with fresh salads, assortment of sodas, teas, beers, and homemade desserts on display. I regret having eaten a large breakfast that day, because everything looked so good! I decided to go with the ham sandwich, since it had pickled peaches on it. (I'll let you connect the dots) It was served on a two pieces of toasted, buttery challah bread. In case you didn't know butter equals love. Then it was topped off with shaved ham, melted brie and the pickled peaches. Pure bliss!   The experience in itself was pleasant. Our food took a little longer than I would have liked, but they were slammed, so I can understand. The outdoor patio is a great spot to people watch and see the coming and goings of downtown Davidson. All staff members were pleasant and one of the owners walked around giving out chip samples, during our wait to order, which I appreciated. Prices were are on the high side for a deli experience, but considering that all the ingredients are fresh, local and handmade, I can get down with it.   I'll certainly give this place another go!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu! Food was high quality. Great service. I was very impressed all around."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and loved it both times.  Fantastic choice of soups and sandwiches.  And some great beers on tap.  The pulled pork was a huge portion on a massive bun.  Super juicy.  Also had the ham, Brie, and peach sandwich, which was delicious.  The back patio overlooking where the Davidson Farmers Mkt resides on Saturdays is perfect on a nice day.  Looking forward to trying more of the menu.  Ignore the negative reviews on here, this place is still new and it is a welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"I will absolutely return again and again whenever I'm in the area. The menu was absolutely special full of unique choices with a homestyle and organic feel. The large tables on the patio are perfect for large gatherings. We went here with our tennis team, and everyone enjoyed the food.   The plentiful gluten-free options put this restaurant in the upper echelon.   LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Often times some of those organic places stinks of hipsters and overpriced food. The Pickled Peach defines organics as a broad reaching to all circles and is absolutely competitively priced compared to their processed lunch neighbors. I've never once been disappointed in the service or the food. Fresh is an understatement for all of their menu items. There's even a giant board honestly listing where every ingredient comes from. It's the type of meal that your palate, body and wallet will thank you for.   Let's also mention that on my second trip in there, regardless of its generally busy lunch patrons coming in, they already remembered my name.   Wonderful teas, coffees and sweets, also. I've tried most of their sandwiches and the shaved beet and honeyed goat cheese while although simple is perfectly executed and absolutely delicious. You're going to want to splurge on one of the ever-changing fresh soups made daily also as a tasty partner."}
{"text":"Outstanding homemade food in a nice little hideaway location.    A great place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I could eat here everyday! He got the roast beef sandwich and I got the falafel salad. This was our first time here and fell in love. We just moved to the area and are so happy we have the Pickled Peach to enjoy!  We had visitors with us, one is a vegan and they had options for her as well! There is a menu that tells you where the food came from!  I will be posting pictures of everyone's meals! They also serve beer and wine, come for dinner they are open until 7, or when they run out of food! There was a note the day before we tried to go, they closed early for that reason!  They also have great coffee! I had an iced blueberry muffin :).  Not only was the food amazing, but the staff was very friendly and helpful!!  We can't wait to come back and take more visitors here!!"}
{"text":"This place will really tickle your pickle. Great staff, delicious food, and nice selection on the menu. The perfect stop for lunch. Nice outdoor space and they're right next to Summit coffee shop."}
{"text":"Great service and very happy and welcoming staff. Food was creative but taste was very average. A quaint place in Davidson where there aren't many options."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5. BEST. SALAD. IVE. EVER. HAD. There was just enough, it wasn't too much or overwhelming. Flavor combinations were AMAZING.   Atmosphere: 5/5. Really nice. Quaint, cool, seating is outdoor, beautiful, lots of families.   Service: 5/5. If it's your first time they'll guide you through ordering. Very friendly. Food came at a reasonable yet borderline long time. But the taste made up for it."}
{"text":"I love this place. I stop here on my way to The Davidson Market. Great local breakfast and lunch choices. Rad beer selection. Lovely coffee and pastry case. Eat the big cookie - you won't be sad you did! The owner is always there and very friendly. I could sit at the window bar or on the patio for hours. Different flavored cold brew teas are excellent. Oh and great music is always playing at the perfect volume. Davidson gem."}
{"text":"Sweet little local spot with excellently sourced food in Davidson, NC. The salads are a good size, but the sandwiches could leave you wanting more, so don't skimp on ordering a side or a dessert. The gluten free brownie is a little rich for my taste, so I'd recommend splitting with a friend. Prices may seem high, but it's worth it for the high quality ingredients. The outdoor covered patio is fantastic on a nice day."}
{"text":"My friend, Harriett, and I decided to meet half way for lunch. She was coming from the north and I was coming from the south, and Davidson was our meeting place. Charming college town with a lot of bistro-esque restaurants.  This one had a name that drew me to it!   Right away, I realized it was little different by how they give customers paper menus and have them stand in line alongside the register, waiting to place their orders. Of course, next to the line is the cabinet with all of the baked desserts and OH they looked really irresistible. I ordered a falafel salad and Harriet had a turkey sandwich.  It was all very straight-forward. No surprises here.  My salad consisted of bib lettuce with a tiny bit of creamy cucumber salad and a few falafels.  Nothing more - nothing less.   The most exciting thing for me was the selection of teas. It was self serve and the tea choices were really cool. /  I think The Pickled Peach is a perfect option for college students and people wanting a simple sandwich or a simple salad. It would be a marvelous place for a person with a sweet tooth.   We sat outside in the courtyard.  Service was fair, at best - as nobody came to see how we were doing with the meal.  Overall, I think this is a fine place and if I were back in the area, I would have no hesitation to return.   Next time, however, I would insist on finding a pickled peach."}
{"text":"Tried this place within its first few days of opening. Had an amazing sandwich with pickled peaches on it. Perfectly prepared. Great outdoor patio and atmosphere.  But...  The prices here will close this place down faster than any other restaurant attempt in Davidson. Spent $12 for a sandwich and drink, no combo options or chips included. I hope they tweak their menu a bit, or at least think a little more creatively about their business model. C'mon Pickled Peach! I want to be a regular, but not at $8.50 a sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service from genuine people you can tell care about what they're doing!  The menu changes with the seasons, but everything I've had here has been from really good to great.  They've got a fun selection of wine, beer, bottled drinks, and baked goods too.  Try to beat the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Moved to NC from Los Angeles last year and was desperate to find what I refer to as \"real food\" AND I was so happy to find The Pickled Peach! Everything is yummm, fresh, seasonal and impeccable quality.   I've had the following items on my visits and enjoy all of them: chicken & veggie soup, carrot ginger soup, ham & brie sandwich and the roasted root veggie salad (deli case). Aditionally, I'm obsessed with their coffee and tea! I don't recall the brands but so good...Please open in Southpark!!! Please."}
{"text":"Just okay. I feel like these recipes are all from Pinterest experimentation with no real formal training in cooking. I want to love this place but I'm rarely wowed when I eat here."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place!  Great food, great options and terrific people. Hard to beat that combination. I've been there two days in a row at times because I enjoy it so much. They have terrific gluten free and vegan options that all taste fabulous. I enjoy being able to sit outside and be a part in what is not only happening on the patio, but also whatever is happening around like the Farmer's Market."}
{"text":"Such a cute atmosphere and food is always incredible. Love the kale salad or the falafel spinach salad, although everything is very good!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Davidson for a weekend workshop from Asheville, NC (locavore food mecca) and let me just say I WISH we had a spot like Pickled Peach. SO fresh! SO conscious! SO damn tasty that I might just eat there for all my meals during my stay. Seriously could give this place 10 stars"}
{"text":"Seriously delish. Although the food does take a little while to come out, trust me - it's worth the wait!   I ordered the soup of the day (broccoli lemon parmesan), the orzo salad (mushrooms, spinach, orzo, lemon), and a ginger kombucha. One of the best lunches I've had in a long while. I left full (but comfortable). Truly wished we lived closer, although I'd probably spend all my money there. Basically, if you're wanting a cute local place serving delicious food (and drinks) made fresh from local farms, this is your place. Go. Now."}
{"text":"Almost missed this place as it's  tucked behind the Ben & Jerry's. I was at the Davidson Farmers Market today and was looking for a place for lunch. My friend suggested this place and I'm glad she did. Friendly service, smiling faces and the food - my goodness! It was fresh and delicious. I had a salad with sweet potato and bacon - don't remember the name. I can't wait to return to this place!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that this restaurant serves fresh, local ingredients on their menu. Many items are also health conscious and delicious as well. I went with a friend who was gluten-free and they were able to accommodate her."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  I had an early dinner here last night and everything was amazing!  I was diagnosed with Celiac disease 12 years ago and very rarely find a place with so many options.  I had a toasted sandwich on the most amazing gluten free bread!  Then I took a special treat home of bread pudding that was also gluten free.  I have not had bread pudding in 12 years and this was by far one of the best I have ever eaten.  I can not compliment the baker here enough or rave about how incredible the desert was.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Adorable spot! Delicious, locally sourced food.   On our first trip, we stopped in for a gluten free Snickerdoodle. We don't usually eat gluten free food but now we want to try all of their gluten free goodies!   During our last trip my husband had a short rib sandwich, and I had a salad with squash and burrata. So so good!   We loved sitting outside to enjoy our food. I assume they enclose the patio when the weather is cold, as they don't have seating indoors.   Always friendly service, and a beautiful atmosphere.   We'll be back...regularly."}
{"text":"I used pickled peach when i was looking for a place to entertain clients for lunch. It ended up being the perfect choice. It was a beautiful day on Davidson's campus. Parking was a little tough so I would suggest you arrive early so you can easily find a nice spot. It reminds you of a cool cafeteria from maybe the 50s in terms of its industrial style. The ordering process was untraditional but very easy, all you have to do is ask and they will give you instructions. Nice deli sandwiches and soups. The food wasn't up quick but that helped you know that they took care in preparing it! The place was popping with folks that seemed affluent and full time moms. If you go during lunch be prepared for a mix of moms and their crying children and Davidson college students and you might see me having a nice client lunch as I'll probably visit there more often now! I rarely give 5 stars but this one deserves it because it was just simple enough to be easy yet exclusive enough to feel upscale, the price was a little high for 3 folks $50 ish for lunch but that's only if you are really watching a tight budget. They also had my favorite ginger ale and other old style glass bottle drinks !"}
{"text":"While wandering through Davidson one sunny Sunday, we realized it was lunch time. I turned to Yelp for suggestions and found the Pickled Peach! This is a deli style restaurant -- you order from the counter and take a seat. Staff brings your food to you when ready by calling your name.   We marveled at the salads and sweets in the display case up front before grabbing a menu and falling into line. The line was about 10 people deep when we arrived (doesn't sound like much but makes the tiny space seem really crowded!) but moved really quickly.   I had the spinach salad with chicken. A tad pricy at $13 but tasty! Ted had the meatball sandwich. I snuck a bite -- also very good. The tomato/meat sauce was really flavorful. We shared the Sunday Green Beans (slow cooked overnight with bacon -- as good as they sound!!) and lentil bacon soup.   99% of seating is outdoors. Since it was warm and grossly humid when we were there, we opted to eat inside at the small counter/bar stools that line the perimeter. Yay, AC!   While we didn't partake in any alcohol on this visit (thanks for not allowing us to booze it up before noon on Sunday, NC, I did notice their impressive selection. They had @5 beers on tap and exponentially more in bottles/cans. Plus wine.   All in all, great little spot in Davidson!"}
{"text":"This was a great little restaurant in a cute little town. The food was all farm to table and fresh as can be. They have a great selection of beer in bottles on top and wines. I had the white bean grilled cheese with spinach and it was super yummy. My son has a BLT and he loved it. Both dishes can you with a little cup of watermelon with mint and it was quite refreshing. The outdoor patio was super cute overlooking a great little grassy Park area."}
{"text":"Sadly, I was extremely disappointed. I was really looking forward to trying this place, as we had Kindred (a restaurant down the street) which was amazing! It was my turn to pick where to eat and I picked this! I've officially lost my picking privileges. First off the service is horrible. Please note, you order at the registered then sit down, so there is not much they have to do.  I ordered a turkey sandwich (see the photo). First off, it tasted bland. How could you get a turkey sandwich wrong...hmmmm. At LEAST toast the sourdough bread, which may of made the presentation better. I asked for lettuce, no lettuce to be found. Just look at the photo, it looks helpless. I didn't even eat half. My dad had a pulled chicken, which was horrible and tasted as if they went overboard with spices! I really wanted to like this place, but it seems like the only thing going is the desserts. I may try again to keep an open mind."}
{"text":"Eclectic, unique, and excellent food, iced tea and desserts in a casual setting in Downtown Davidson.  Friendly & welcoming atmosphere- and an excellent grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"We recently did whole 30, and can I say pickled peach saved me. I wasn't able to eat out much but when I was really itching to at least I could find a space. Their food is fresh in a bit unique but oh so good. I was able to get a braised beef collared wrap with avocado beets and pickled stuff. It was wonderful.  For my non-whole 30 days, I love any of their salads and their BLT which comes on cornbread and sometimes will have a fried green tomato, which is amazing!  They serve beer and wine.  They have limited hours.  They have interesting sides but all very good.  They have an option of four different unsweetened flavored teas, coffee, and baked goods that are out of this world.  Located in downtown Davidson with a fantastic extra-large patio overlooking the park.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My mom treated my daughter and I for my birthday this summer. I don't remember what we ate but I remember that it was delicious. My mom was SUPER impressed with the menu and that's hard to do. She's a strict vegan and this is the first time I can recall her not having some kind of complaint about a menu.  We ate on the porch outside. It was really cool and laid back.  The staff was helpful and nice folks too. (My mom had a TON of questions about ingredients, etc.)  I will definitely return to the Pickled Peach. Maybe for Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now I keep hoping to be impressed, but they always fall a bit short.  The place itself is super cute.  Love the outdoor seating.  The menu is ok...I enjoyed their turkey and avocado sandwich, but their shrimp roll was quite disappointing.  Tasteless and full of way too much mayo.  Their baked goods are hit or miss. Sometimes they are fresh and yummy and sometimes they are stale and old.  FYI the \"super delicious brownie\"  is not super delicious....more like \"bland and slightly stale\".  The staff seems very uncaring and snotty....as if I'm bothering them by ordering my food.  Not cool.  Service is also pretty slow.  The last two times we went (both non rush times) my husband had to get up to see if our food was forgotten or still being made.  It just takes far too long for a simple non-cooked sandwich.  Hoping they will improve...otherwise we'll stick to better options in Davidson, like Kindred for lunch."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no idea what all the fuss is about. I had heard and read such good things about this place, so I finally convinced some friends from work to go here with me for lunch. It was five of us, we all ordered different things and not one of us was satisfied with our meals. I ordered the braised beef sandwich in a kale wrap. My friends had a turkey sandwich, two of them ordered the roast beef sandwich and someone else got a shrimp sandwich (may have been a po' boy). Firstly, the serving sizes were hilariously small. The sandwiches were tiny, and I'm not even exaggerating. The po' boy was the only sandwich that was decent sized. Mine was the size of a summer roll, no kidding. But it may have been partly my fault for ordering it in a kale wrap instead of bread. And then the kale-white bean crap they give you on the side, it literally came in a tiny bowl, the size they serve ketchup in at fast food restaurants. When the first order came out and we saw it, we laughed out thinking it was some kind of silly joke and part of his food was still on its way... it wasn't. Then why serve a little sandwich with its sad little kale companion on a huge ass tray? But anyway. My sandwich came out in a bread. I had to send it back because I was on a no-carb diet. Mistakes were made, because it took them forever to make another sandwich or rewrap my braised beef in kale, apparently. But I felt the worst for the guy who had the shrimp po' boy. His sandwich came out after three of us had finished their meals. This is ridiculous! Especially at the prices they charge. An average of $9 for kids meal sized sandwiches, and the tiny sampler bowl of the kale-bean salad. Not one of us left the place feeling full or satisfied. Seating is really tight too. The patio has some picnic tables, but since it's not covered, they were all wet from last night's rain. Needless to say, we won't be stepping foot in this restaurant again, or even recommending it to anyone. And get rid of the stupid hipster aluminum trays that you serve the pathetic sandwiches on guys, this isn't prison."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp while driving home to Charlotte from the mountains. I couldn't be happier we stumbled upon it! We had a tough time making a decision as several menu items sounded delicious. Both my husband and I truly enjoyed our meals and would make the trip back to Davidson to enjoy again! The atmosphere is rather enjoyable and our dogs were welcome on the porch (they even brought them water). Would highly recommend for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Forget the reviews complaining about price. It is a bit more  expensive, but so are very many restaurants in the area. It's not an eat-here-everyday-for-lunch kind of price, but there's a reason for that. All the ingredients used here are very high quality, and mostly sourced locally. In fact, the origin of every ingredient is listed on a big chalkboard when you walk in. They have a great selection of specialty drinks, some house-made and many bottled (and a LOT of teas!) They even have a small selection of beers on tap and in bottles. The food is made with great care, and each time I've been everyone has loved what they ordered. The menu changes a little seasonally, and there's not once been something on there that hasn't interested me. If you have allergies or food restrictions, or just don't like an ingredient in a meal the kitchen will work with you to either substitute or create an entirely new dish for you. THAT is amazing customer service. The owner and the kitchen staff once custom-made me an enormous marshmallow cookie because I couldn't eat the ones already made due to an allergy. They insisted I be able to enjoy an item I wanted, and that it was no trouble for them. They even remade the marshmallow cream because they were out of it - and charged me the same price. Wonderful people, wonderful food. I highly recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"I had the Caesar Salad w, Kale and Chicken and it was great. Will be back for sure to try a sandwich."}
{"text":"The Pickled Peach is a great lunch spot in Downtown Davidson. The Fried Green Tomato BLT is perfect. I have had 2 or 3 soups and they are all delicious as well. Fresh food, cool outdoor porch area and Davidson charm. A must try on Main St!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it was absolutely delicious!! I had the beet sandwich with goat cheese and arugula and it was delightful! The food tastes really fresh and local! 10 out of 10 would DEFINITELY come again!!"}
{"text":"I've loved everything I've tried here. They have interesting twists on classic sandwiches and salads. Everything is fresh and delicious! A little pricey especially considering the portion sizes of some of the items, but the quality of the food makes up for it. Very cool atmosphere as well. I also wish the portion sizes of the sides were a little bigger because they're so delicious! Still 5 stars for the taste and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had this for the first time yesterday and it exceeded expectations (and my expectations were high!)!!!!! I was blown away. I got a kids grilled cheese and a kids ham and pickled peach sandwich and it was a delightful treat. I'm ready to go back today for another one! Super cool atmosphere, nice staff, clean facility, and delicious food!! An easy five stars :)"}
{"text":"Great food and vibe, and they always have vegan options. My go-to is the hummus sandwich with avocado, and a side of whatever vegan soup they have that day. I love that they rotate soups often and always have at least on vegan option. Cute space, nice service, and consistently good food!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! So happy my husband suggested this off-the-beaten path eatery. We thoroughly enjoyed our soup and sandwich dishes. The meatball sandwich was THE BEST meatball sandwich I've ever had! I also had a super indulgent cookie/frosting sandwich. So good! We're definitely visiting again when we're back in Davidson. Cudos to the chef(s)! The service was also great as well as the ambience."}
{"text":"It was... ok. Overpriced. I had the pulled chicken sandwich and my first bite was full of cartilage. I had to spit it out.  There definitely was not a lot of chicken but the flavor was good. My husband had the ham sandwich which was good but also had barely any meat on it. $22 for 1 bag of chips and two sandwiches that were ok at best. I gave three stars because of the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Love this place. Sometimes when I visit the south, I have a tough time finding a good place to eat as being vegetarian is mostly unheard of in these parts.  I went here for lunch with a friend and ordered a soup (some sort of squash, lemon, ginger mix) as well as a white hummus sandwich.  The soup was delicious. It was a pureed type soup and I thought it was going to be a little strange tasting but it was so so good. The sandwich was excellent as well. It consisted of hummus, a lettuce mix, and avocado (substituted for mozz) and was delicious. It was a little messy to eat as I imagine it would have stayed together more with the mozz but still tasted great.  They didn't have any vegan dessert options when I was there and the portions are on the smaller side so I was still pretty hungry after I finished eating, though I will admit that I tend to eat more than the average person.   The service was excellent, you order and then they bring it out to your table. The person who brought us our food noticed that our table was a little wobbly, and promptly brought a little wedge thingy to make it not wobble. I was pretty impressed because it was minimally wobbly as I hadn't even notice it until he mentioned it.  I like the idea of a rotating menu and it seems like there are always at least 1-2 vegan options on the menu so I'd likely go back the next time I'm in the area. It's located on the main street in Davidson so it was nice to walk around and check out the area once we finished eating. I also liked that there was outdoorish seating. What I mean by that is that it was outdoors but enclosed so it was comfortable with regards to temperature and has tons of natural light to enjoy."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. Salads, sandwiches, soups, and desserts. Couldn't find the menu anywhere online so while I was there I took  picture of it and will post it.   The BLT sandwich was amazing (with a fried green tomato? Say no more).  No lie, the double chocolate fudge cookie (it's the one with sugar coated on the outside) was the BEST COOKIE I'VE EVER HAD.  Lemonade is good but just know there's no refills on it."}
{"text":"The Pickled Peach is one of my favorites! Their sandwiches, soups, salads and even cold case items are absolutely delish! If I were to take one star away, it would be due to the cost of the food. While I love it and am willing to pay it from time to time, lunch for two with a glass of wine is easily $40.00"}
{"text":"I came here for a cookie and water.  Not on purpose, but I was having coffee and lunch somewhere else and happened to nearby.  And since it was bookmarked I had to try something!  The seating is outdoors.  So, you order and then take your food outside.  The patio is decently sized and open. It can get a tad hot depending on the day.  It was nicely decorated and had cute plants on each table.  The service was good.  I would like to try this place again for some other food next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a whim and were absolutely blown away by their white bean hummus sandwich with avocado. 10/10 would order again."}
{"text":"We love this place and are frequent customers. Love how they are very careful about what ingredients they use and where they come from. I feel like  it's worth a little more money to be able to trust that you're getting high quality ingredients. I love that the menu changes with the seasons so you know you're getting fresh real food  and you can always try something new.  Some of our favorites are the blueberry tea, falafel, and the soups are always great. The Mexican beef soup might be my all time favorite. The sides and salads are seasonal and so fresh. I recently tried a shaved asparagus salad with pine nuts and white balsamic - amazing! The oatmeal cream pies are amazing. My husband and I also love trying all of the fun soda choices that are much better than your typical soft drinks. The Cherry Tree Cola is great. Also we love the Zapps spicy chips - yum!"}
{"text":"Small place, BIG FLAVOR! Great little selection of craft sodas, wine by the glass, and beer on tap. Local ingredients for their salads, soups, and sandwiches. Quiet outdoor seating just off Main St. Many gluten-free options.  It's located behind the Ben and Jerry's and there is a small 2 hour lot so you don't have to parallel park on Main St."}
{"text":"Davidson has really developed the small, college town main street vibe, and I love it. Went to this cute cafe for lunch a few weeks ago, enjoyed beautiful weather on the patio and some killer sandwiches.  My wife had the roast beef, and I had the ham, brie and pickled peaches. Both were good, although I'm sure my was better, and the coconut sugar cookie was an excellent way to top a fully stuffed belly. The kitchen is a little slow, so don't be in a rush to get somewhere."}
{"text":"Good quality ingredients, well prepared, in a very popular (so sometimes crowded) place. Very informal, popular with the college crowd. Nice people."}
{"text":"There isn't anything negative I can say about this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Cornelius North Carolina! When you first enter the restaurant you order at the counter. There are two or three soups of the day and you're welcome to taste them before you order. Today they had tomato soup, turkey mulligatawny and Tuscan white bean (vegan).  The occasion was to celebrate my daughter picking out her wedding dress. So after she said Yes to the Dress we stopped at the Pickled Peach and the food was memorable. Lady K had cornmeal fried shrimp sandwich. This consisted of cornmeal breaded shrimp spicy mayo butter lettuce and a roasted tomato on a roasted long roll for $10.50. She said the texture was amazing, the spicy mayo was the perfect condiment and you could actually taste the grits in the shrimp breading. She also had their potato salad which is beyond description. Huge chunks of potato and I believe season with tarragon but I'm not sure. My I cannot daughter and I split a grilled cheese sandwich. This is like no grilled cheese you've ever had. 1 year aged cheddar inside with a ig cells dry jack cheese on the outside of the sourdough  bread. The cheese on the outside was crispy and so yummy. Perfect for dipping in our tomato soup. Lady M had the spinach salad but she left off the blue cheese. Personally I would have added more blue cheese but that's beside the point. Besides the blue cheese it comes with roasted red onions, dried cranberries, toasted walnuts and it's  tossed with a sweet sorghum vinaigrette for $8.50 . She loved the salad and said everything was fresh the salad dressing was delicious. The top off a male we each tried a different craft tea. They were delicious. If you're looking for an Eclectic homie place with delicious food try this place out. Even the bathrooms are cool!"}
{"text":"I had the slow-roasted beef sandwich or whatever they call the Bahn Mi. It was unbelievable. Also, I am a little curious about why some of the other reviewers found the service lacking. It was impeccable during my visit.   I have only had one thing on the menu, but I will make it a practice to go eat here once a week because it was far better than anything I have had in this area for lunch.   If the people at the restaurant read these things, the only thing I would suggest is to move the teas somewhere more convenient. It is weird to fill up your tea right where people are entering to order. This might be a spacing issue, and again, not a deal-breaker for me."}
{"text":"Really like the place. A fresh take on fast food...just not so fast. Tasted fresh. I am not a huge fan of get your own Iced tea and soup only because some of us have bags and or kids. But we can handle that unless its really crowded. Waiter service might be nice even of you place you order and then they just bring out your drinks and food. I will say love the soups and the sandwiches are really good.  A little on the expesive side but you get what you pay for. Good luck. Maybe a groupon or yelp discount woudl be amazing and make other try"}
{"text":"So, as someone who cares what I put in my mouth, I was ecstatic when I heard about the Pickled Peach in Davidson. Everything is locally sourced and absolutely delicious. Their kale salad (in the front case) is an awesome side choice, and any one of their salads will leave you satisfied. Very friendly staff, great outdoor seating, and amazing coffee. If you haven't been yet, I would highly recommend you grab a friend and have a nice lunch on the patio!"}
{"text":"Love the variety of vegetarian options they offer. We both tried different soups which were delicious and filling. Sandwiches were fresh and had great flavor. Service was very friendly and fast. Not too much seating if they are busy. We will surely return when visiting Davidson!"}
{"text":"The coffee! Love love love this place! The food is yummy and the pastries are delish too"}
{"text":"Yeah I give it five stars because of the very fresh food and friendly chill vibe. Their granola bar is the best all time. Excellent teas and coffee. Always three innovative soups available with free tastings to decide which one you want. Unique sandwiches with super fresh ingredients. Pricey and worth it."}
{"text":"First timers, it was good. I had the Bacon with fried green tomatoes, really good sandwich. My wife had a good sandwich also. Very nice sitting outside under cover. Staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at The Pickled Peach for the first time yesterday. We enjoyed our meal tremendously.  We ordered pulled chicken sandwich and the slow braised and pulled chicken ($8 each) was very tasty and moist! I ordered a canned lemon drink that had zero sugar and it was surprisingly very good! My husband thoroughly enjoyed his café latté with his chocolate chip and cherry cookie.  I was in heaven as I ate my coconut cookie, it was delicious.  Not only would we recommend this very healthy food and drink establishment, but we cannot wait to go back again.    The folks who work at The Pickled Peach need to be singled out!  The young woman at the cash / front counter was kind, very helpful to us while we looked at the menu when we arrived, and we met Kimmie (sp?), who (we found out later) is part owner.  Kimmie took quite a bit of her very busy schedule to speak with me and my husband while we were receiving our food at our table.  The chefs in the kitchen - which you can see through the window at the porch - were extremely busy but, from what we could see, had a great camaraderie with each other.   And one last item - the price: My husband and I felt the price for such healthy, fresh food that was made with caring hands was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Dude. This spot. I wish I lived anywhere near here. I'd come here all of the time. Unfortunately, I live in LA. Best chicken sandwich I've had in a while. I want to try every sandwich on the menu! And the sweet tea was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place to grab something casual, tasty, and relatively quickly.   The menu offers a nice range of flavors at an affordable price, and there are a handful of daily deli sides, chips, and delicious looking sweets available as well. I ended up ordering the braised beef sandwich. The flavor was amazing, however, the bread it came on was too thick and crusty for me to truly eat it as a sandwich. I still enjoyed it, I just ended up eating the insides first and some of bread after the fact. Also, my friend ordered the grilled cheese, which sounds simple but it looked so good.   I also really like that they have an outdoor patio. Apparently it's completely open during the warmer months, but even in the winter they utilize it by closing it off and running heaters above the dining area. It was cute and definitely a buzzing spot.   I would recommend it to anyone and definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"I've been twice for lunch now, once with my wife and once alone.  And, based on those visits, I've stopped in to pick up some of the daily fresh salads to go.  With that info in tow, I have been really interested in reading some of the negative reviews that have led to a 3.5 star average.  More on my take on those reviews later.  The two sandwiches I have tried have both been fantastic.  Roast beef and horseradish cream with arugula on a sub roll and the fried green tomato BLT on griddled sourdough.  Both were delicious with top quality bread and fresh, tasty ingredients.  You also get a small cup of one of their salads on the side and even though I hate lentils, I scarfed them up as prepared on my second visit.  My wife had a turkey sandwich and loved the fact she could get it wrapped in a collard leaf vs. on bread.  Nice option for low carb folks.  I also had some delicious beef stew that was one of the soups of the day on our first trip.  Very flavorful.  So regarding the other, more negative, reviews I see they basically lump into two categories.  The biggest of these is about high prices and the other mentions service deficiencies.  My take on price is this...  This ain't Subway people.  The ingredients are locally sourced (check out the chalkboard over the kitchen), much care is obviously taken in their selection and preparation and the results more than meet the mark on the quality vs what you pay ratio.  In terms of service, I have only experienced the staff to be friendly, personable, knowledgeable and proud of what they are doing.  When in Davidson, I would always have Pickled Peach at/near the top of my list for a great lunch or early dinner."}
