{"text":"This was my first time ever trying korean style snow ice desserts and I will definitely be coming back for more! I was expecting shaved ice similar to the hong kong style or filipino style halo-halo but this was different. It is more like snow, the kind of fresh snowfall that makes everything quiet outside. Snow made of milk.

I wanted to try so many of their different flavour combinations but I settled on the green tea bingsu. It was just the right amount of bitter-sweet ratio of the green tea powder to red bean. There was a scoop of green tea ice cream on top with a sprinkling of almond flakes that added a nice crunch to the otherwise soft pillowy-ness of the dessert. 

My husband ordered the mango bingsu which was good. The mango chunks + mango sauce were very sweet (as to be expected) but the cheesecake bits neutralized it. Our friend also ordered the injeolmi bingsu which was the least flavourful of all our choices. It tasted 'crispy' - like how rice cereal has little flavour but you eat it more for the crispiness.

I imagine this place will become very busy as word gets out that they've opened. There are a few tables and chairs at the bar to accommodate a good number of people but I expect line ups will be the norm."}
{"text":"Had the black sesame bingsu and the coffee bingsu. I really love that they have layers of black sesame in between the shaved ice. Most places just pile toppings on top of the ice itself.

The coffee one was a bit too sweet for my liking, but my friend really enjoyed it. The cereal topping adds some great texture and crunch

I will say though, the wait for our food was absurdly long."}
{"text":"My first time having bingsu and it was delicious.  

This cafe is small with limited seating.  Even though it was a Tuesday night, it was full.  

Service was prompt.  You are given a buzzer for when your order is ready.  I had the mango bingsu.  I was tasty - yummy.  We also had green tea.  This was not to my taste.

I will be back to try other flavours and options."}
{"text":"From the aesthetics of their bingsu cups to the taste of it, I absolutely love Cups Bingsu Cafe. Every time I go i would have trouble deciding between the Matcha or the tiramisu cup because both are so delicious. My only complain is that the restaurant is small and It is very difficult to actually find a seat to sit at."}
{"text":"A great authentic Korean shaved ice dessert place in Markham. Came here on a Friday night and it was packed. We were told that a table might be available in 10 mins. We left to look for other options and was glad to receive a call later that there was a table for us. 

Service:
Awesome service. They went out of their to make us feel welcome. After a table was available, they moved a lot of empty tables around to create one for our group. We we're Willi g to squish but they said it was no trouble to set it up. It is a self serve order dessert and pick up style with utensils and water stations. You're then given a beaper and once your dessert is ready, you can pick it up. Desserts came pretty quickly. 

Food:
Our group ordered the green tea, mango, cheese and black sesame cups. The 3 sizes are good in that you can order to share based on group size. If the flavours, my favourite was green tea. I loved the combination of the red bean, mochi and almond. The matcha flavour was strong. The black sesame was also very good with a strong nutty flavour. Mango one had fresh mangos and was very refreshing. The hot fruit drinks also looked and smelled very good, will try next time."}
{"text":"It was delicious.  Very light.  Not a heavy dessert.  Many varieties on the menu for Asian and non Asian tastes.  Would love to see other stuff like real taro cubes, lotus seeds, grass jelly, bobo balls."}
{"text":"Korean shaved ice is very different from other ones as it is very fluffy. Layers of fluffy snowflakes alternating with layers of flavors (depending of what you order). Full of texture and flavors, yet very light. Not too sweet, but flavorful. Delicious treat to share. Flavors are very unique. I think the black sesame one is the best one I had. I have tried the mango (can't go wrong, but it's just mango); cheese (interesting mix of cream cheese, parmesan etc.) but not so much of a dessert; coffee (cool mix of textrure and flavors, taste a little like a breakfast in a bowl with cheerios, coffee, cornflakes etc). Comes in 3 sizes: cup, small, or large, from $8-12.

The place is small, so there is usually a wait, especially if you have a bigger group. Staff was nice, but it is mostly self-serve. You order and pay at counter, wait for order at table, get your own water etc. 

Definitely going back...for the black sesame bingsu!"}
{"text":"Came here after going to a gym for an after workout reward! Pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and the diverse flavours offered by this chain. With high expectations, we ordered the large size of the Injeolmi which was notably the most popular flavour stated by the worker. It was a good serving size for three people!

This might be subjective but I thought this flavour was very dry as we didn't have too much condensed milk and the soy bean powder stuck to your mouth. We actually ordered more condensed milk with no extra charge. 

Tried the mango bingsu during another visit and this flavour is much more enjoyable. Not dry and had sauce layered throughout. They also added cheesecake to the bowl which added a new layer of taste. 

Overall the atmosphere is beautiful and it's good for a chill time with you best friends. Large is the perfect serving size for three-four people, and I like it. I would come again to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"The tiramisu cup is creamy, snowice deliciousness! It comes with a mousse tiramisu square on top! :) 

However, the black sesame latte was super duper gritty... more than expected. I'll try another type of latte next time!"}
{"text":"This place serves cups of heaven, I'm not a fan of bingsu or shaved ice, but this was legit. The cups of dessert is layered with your choice of flavour so it wasn't JUST a cup of shaved boring ice. I loved the tiramisu flavour cause I'm a huge fan. Mango cheesecake was also highly recommended. If you haven't tried.. it is well worth a try. 4 stars !!"}
{"text":"Went here to fill the craving for bingsu. Of course it can't match the one I had in Seoul but it was good enough. I would go here again (if I was in the area). Restaurant was small and it took a while to get our tiramisu and green tea bingsu. I enjoyed both. Although I wish the ice was better. It wasn't as fine as I remembered in Seoul."}
{"text":"Must Try: Mango Bingsu, Strawberry Bingsu, Grape Bingsu 

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Long story short: I'm addicted. 

Since visiting their other two locations in North York, I have yet to find another Bingsu restaurant that comes close to Cups. Other shops either charge a lot more for a lot less or just don't have fresh or plentiful ingredients/toppings.

Each dessert is made with care and precision, which does add to the wait time. However, it is worth the wait! At peak times (post-dinner and late night), it does get tricky to get a seat, so non-peak times are the best time to go!

The service here is top notch and the restaurant seating is comfortable and clean.

Aside from Bingsu, they also have different desserts and drinks available! 

This Cups location earns my rare 5-Star & Perfect-10 rating!"}
{"text":"Came the other day. Quality is not nearly as high as the one in north York. Quite disappointed."}
{"text":"So so good. Got the mango bingsu in the small size (11.30 incl tax) perfect for sharing between 2 people. It was a Monday, I waited for a long time to get my order but the worker was by herself and the store was almost to capacity so I was a little more understanding than I would be if there were more staff. Reading from some other reviews, they should really have more people on the floor to compensate for the rush of customers. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Finally a Korean dessert place that's good enough so I don't have to trek out to Koreantown! It was packed for a Sunday night and considering this place opened under a month ago. Its a small place, maybe about 15 tables or so. It's set up more as a self-serve style, so you take a menu and sit wherever you'd like. Once you decide on your order, you go up and order and they'll give you a buzzer which would notify you to pick up the food when it's ready. 

I ordered a large green matcha bingsu ($11) which was good enough to share between 2 people. There are cup, small, and large sizes available. Think of red solo cups (a little taller but less circular) for their cup size, it's enough for one person if they just had dinner. Small and large can be shared by two people. Considering the place was packed, the wait wasn't too long- about 5-10 minutes for the ice cream which wasn't too bad. They do have other hot and cold drinks available and some other desserts such as brick toast. Water is available - off to the side. Debit and/or cash only. 

Would come back again to try their different flavours!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Pretty surprised by how small the size small was. It was my first time trying their tiramisu flavour and it was actually really good. Love the slice of tiramisu cake they put ontop. I also tried their coffee flavour, also pretty good. I noticed that there was way too much condensed milk, or whatever else toppings they put in there and too little snow(way too little)."}
{"text":"I love CUPS!! It's my go-to place whenever I crave milk shaved ice. The Injeolmi flavour in specific is my absolute favourite! I love how it's not super sweet, perfect in texture and taste with the soybean powder, chewy mochi, almond flakes and condense milk. I also love how all the toppings are evenly distributed in sections so that you get the perfect taste in every bite. 

When I first found out that they were opening a location at FMP, I was super excited because it's closer to home. Ambience is simple, clean and casual. It's definitely bigger in size compared to other locations and feels comfier. They have a cute plant displayed on every table. Water station is also available if you get thirsty. Quality tasted just like the other places. Whether if it's a franchise or not, I love the fact that it's authentic. This location opens on Sunday compared to others which are closed.

Staffs were all really friendly and attentive. They also surprised us with a free slice of chocolate cake. One downfall to this location is that it's $1 more than other locations."}
{"text":"I am impressed by their service before I order anything. I came with a group of friends after badminton and there were 12 of us. The waiter worked so hard to find all the vacant tables and chairs and put them together for us. He's so sincere and did everything with a smile.

This place is not too big but it's nicely decorated and packed with many customers. It's fond of its shaved ice and I ordered a matcha  shaved ice.

There are red bean, almond slices, mochi, match ice cream  and matcha powder on top of the shaved ice. Basically, the taste of all of these ingredients blended very well together. Personally, I find that it's a bit too sweet. 

Even though the shaved ice tastes a bit too sweet, I love their service and this is what attracts me to come back again. I will certainly come back to try another flavour of shaved ice."}
{"text":"Excellent quick dessert joint - the main thing here is bingsu (shaved ice) but there are a variety of other things. It's quite busy here but you can usually still manage to find a seat. It is an order and seat yourself type of place. Despite this, a staff is quite quick about cleaning tables. 

A small bingsu portion is good enough to share between two people, but I do find there's not enough flavoured ingredients (ie. Not enough green tea ice cream on the matcha bingsu) so you do end up eating more than a few mouthfuls of plain ice near the end. Will return to try their various flavours."}
{"text":"Bingsu is a popular Korean shaved ice dessert - a perfect thing to try when Toronto is experiencing a polar vortex. The shaved ice is very differently cut than the Taiwanese equivalent, producing an interesting texture and attractive shape. The toppings are well blended and nicely arranged. Overall it makes a tasty cool treat for a not-so-cheap price"}
{"text":"I am so happy that Cups opened in First Markham Place so i don't have to go all the way to north york to eat korean shaved ice when i crave for it lol.

Cups never disappoints! Their shaved ice are so soft and delicious!! I ordered mango shaved ice and they filled up my bowl with freshed mangoes and mango syrup !! The bowl is quite huge though and i would recommend it to be shared between 2 people per bowl- if you want a smaller size they do offer cup size.

The price is pretty decent for the size of the bowl. 
The staff there are very friendly.

This is a dessert place that i can see myself always go back to. :)

Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Location/Service
Within the First Markham Place - it took over the location where ShareTea used to be (so it's near the mall entrance area). Lots of parking available. Inside the cafe has the same layout as ShareTea, but it renovated to be more brighter with a homey feeling to it. Small amount of seating are available, so it's possible to come here in a bigger group. 

Service was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful - I came in on a busy night and they missed out my order (as the buzzer never rang) and they quickly fulfilled it without no screw-ups on the dessert. Do note that everything is a self serve - find your own seats, grab your own utensils, bring the finished food back to the waiters. Staff will still assist if there are certain request that you like (adjusting tables, wiping off, etc.)

Food
Specializing in Bingsu, which is Korean shaved ice. Essentially it's like one of those 7-Eleven slushies, but the ice is shaved into tiny flakes - like literally so tiny that you don't even realize it's ice. And it's so thin and small that when you bite it in, it's not super cold giving you brain freeze or the feeling of just chewing ice. 

Ordered two products - black sesame and red bean.  Both of similar toppings (mochi, soybean powder, almond flakes and sweet red bean). The ice-cream was different between the two - both were scooped ones (not soft serve). Size was it was a small (~$9.00) - and for that size, it was shareable between 2 people. Both 'cups' were flavorful and distinctive, you can taste the layors of black sesame, red bean, soybean; and it blended well with the ice flakes and ice-cream. To note, it does melt a little quick - so caution to eat it a bit faster (or else it will look a little watery).

I'll definitely come back even if it's the winter, cause again - it's not cold enough that only summer time is suitable. They also serve coffee and lattes - perfect during the day when you want to come in and chill/study."}
{"text":"Once you go black... Black Sesame Bingsu. You were thinking of something else weren't you? 

My favorite is their Injeolmi Bingsu. So simple but soooo good! I like that it's not too sweet too.

I finally have my alternative to Injeolmi Bingsu, and it's Black Sesame Bingsu! If you love black sesame, it's a must try! And if you're a little iffy abou red bean, I initially was as well, but it ended up going really well with it.

Warning about their taro latte, they use taro powder."}
{"text":"Ordered the coffee bingsu and it is now my new favourite. I usually go for the Oreo bingsu but it tends to be a little too sweet after you are half way into the dessert. The coffee one was perfect as the bitterness of the coffee helped to offset any sweetness from the ice cream and syrup. The Cheerios and cornflakes on top added a nice crunch. I wished they put more Mochi on the dessert though as there were only 5 tiny pieces and I had to spoon wrestle my bf for the last Mochi."}
{"text":"Of all Bingsu places up town, this was not my favourite. I appreciate that the inside was very modern and trendy but the quality of the food was not good at all. We were a fairly large group so we had an opportunity to order multiple items on the menu to share. 

The fruit brick toast was 4 slices of regular bread toasted and piled together then smothered in an abnormal amount of whip cream and very little fruit. I had to scoop off some of the whipped cream, filled a whole 250 mL glass and still had plenty of whipped cream to spare. I definitely found that the whipped cream took away from the condensed milk that was spread in between the slices of toast. This is also the first time I've had brick toast that was comprised of 4 layers of bread that looked like it was from T&T. 

The Tiramisu Bingsu was not creamy at all and was very crunchy. Rather than being milky, it tasted more like shaved ice and there was no espresso component to the Bingsu. The other Bingsu we ordered were the same -- crunchy and not flavourful. 

The black sesame latte smelled very promising but was too sweet to drink. It definitely looked better than it tasted. 

Overall, the Bingsu was not the best. I should note that the other Cups locations had better tasting Bingsu than this location. I definitely would not recommend or return to this location -- it's not worth the money."}
{"text":"This is THE go to dessert place if you are craving something cold, light, and sweet on that hot summer day. I absolutely love shaved ice- especially since I had it everyday when I was in Korea. 

I came in the late afternoon on a Friday and there were plenty of tables and free wifi that you can use. I was happy to see that they had an assortment of flavours, and they actually had a very traditional Korean flavour called Injeolmi (highly recommend this one!)

My friend and I ordered a Tiramisu and a Green Tea Bingsu. I really like how they weren't too sweet, and it's just a really refreshing dessert. Most importantly, you know this place is good when they don't use regular shaved ice but its a lot more creamy and milky flavour.

They have a lot of different teas and lattes, so it's a great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"the sourness of the green grapes compliments the sweetness of the green grape puree
cheesecake goes rlly well with the vanilla ice cream i like it
but the puree is a little too sweet when you eat it by itself
looks good 
yummy 
:-)"}
{"text":"Refreshing and so yummy! I was craving bingsoo and decided to try cups. I've never had it before so I was glad to try it. 

I got the strawberry one with cheesecake chunks inside and of course strawberry. I wished they had an extra side of condensed milk like snow time. Half way through the bowl the sauce lacked and the snow on the bottom was left with no flavor. I tried mixing it but it just was not enough. 

Overall pretty yummy nice lounge spot with plenty of spots."}
{"text":"Visited this korean bingsu cafe twice already and absolutely loved their bingsu selection, tried both the matcha and black sesame bingsu and both were just amazing. Cant wait to try out the rest of their selection cause everything just looks and sounds so good. They have 3 different sizes, and they provide small bowls for sharing! Such a cute little cafe too, they have a comfortable seating area where you can just sit and enjoy your dessert or drink with a either a large group or small group or even just down time for yourself! Definitely will go back again in the near near future."}
{"text":"Despite them opening a second location here at First Markham Place and me living so close to it, this was my first time here.  I was so glad to be able to try The Cups's bingsu for the first time and see what the hype was all about.  

We shared the Injeolmi Bingsu, the original bingsu flavour.  It had Korean glutinous rice flour, mochi, and sliced almonds all atop a bowl of finely shaved ice (actually milk).

(It took about 10 to 15 minutes to be ready after ordering at the counter.)

The only similar one I've had and can compare it to is the one from Dear & Fro.  I found that this one at The Cups had much more glutinous rice flour and thus my first bite had it all over my mouth and I had to have a second bite of the shaved ice in order to 'melt' it a bit.  Overall, it was good and I especially liked the chewy mochi.  I found that the bingsu from Dear & Fro was a tiny bit more milkier.

If I find myself here again next time, I will try their Tiramisu one which actually has a slice of tiramisu cake on top of it!"}
{"text":"Shared the large Strawberry Bingsu ($12) with a friend today. The texture of the shaved us was very fluffy and reminded me of very fine coconut shavings. Topped with strawberry ice cream, strawberry puree, cubes of cheesecake, and a generous amount of freshly cut strawberries,  the whole bingsu did not taste too sweet which was great. There was a perfect ratio of shaved ice to toppings which I really liked so I didn't end up with all ice when I got to the bottom of the bowl.  The flavours all balanced each other out very well. I was also tried the Injeolmi Bingsu which consisted of soybean powder, chewy mochi, vanilla ice cream and almond flakes. It was a little messier to eat since we ordered the cup size. I would recommend getting this menu item in a bowl as the soybean powder does find its way onto the table when you're scooping it out of the cup. When eating this, make sure you have all the components of the bingsu on your spoon as it can taste rather dry, powdery, and bland if you only get the soybean powder, almond flakes and the ice. Without the ice cream, there is no sweetnesss to it that holds it all together. I'd definitely be back to try some of their hot lattes, desserts, and other bingsus."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert tonight, after our meal nearby. We walked in, took a menu and sat down to decide what we wanted to order.  My kids decided on Mango, Blueberry and Green Tea Bingsus.  We all ordered the small size because we'd just had dinner and because we've never tried Bingsu before, and didn't quite know what to expect. 

You go up to the counter to order and pay and then they give you a buzzer, to let you know when your order is ready to collect.  Our order took nearly 20 minutes to prepare.  When we got them we were really underwhelmed.  The sizes are quite small and because the ice is so fine, it's mainly air that you're paying for.  My son polished his off in a few minutes.  My girls took longer to eat their desserts.  The ice itself was plain and tasteless, like eating snow (other reviewers were talking about milk flavour).  For the price you pay, it's nothing spectacular and sizes aren't that big.  

Seating is limited here and they will have a problem during busy times.  We were there for an hour, from deciding our orders, to ordering, paying, waiting for our desserts and eating.  Some people had finished eating, when we arrived but continued to sit there.  Other people shared a small dessert and took up too much space.  So good luck to people looking for a table to sit down, during busier times.  There are 2 other dessert places nearby that I would choose to go to, over this place.  But my kids loved the sensation of eating 'fluffy snow' ."}
{"text":"Really good bingsu. The shaved ice itself is milk flavored. Don't go during peak hours. There will be a huge line. Three different sizes for bingsu (cup, small, large). Really beautiful presentation (ig-worthy pictures). Some flavors of the bingsus take quite awhile to make. You have been warned haha. So service fluctuates for some ppl. For the most part it's relatively efficient imo. You get an electronic pager for your order.

It is located next to mabu generation and used to be a Sharetea. I will probably return to try a strawberry bingsu. Flavor was nice."}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice bathroom, new and clean.. I'm into it!

The shaved ice was great, it's the actual fluffy stuff not the snowcone crap.

I ordered the large matcha one which was really tasty. I would prefer if the actual ice is flavoured instead of matcha powder on top. The mochi was nice but not enough! You can easily split the large with someone.

Would try a new flavour next time!"}
{"text":"I give 4.5 stars because I found their taro latte to be lacking in flavour. The whole milk they used somewhat overpowered the taro powder taste.

Their bingsu, on the other hand, is great! My favourite is the matcha red bean as their matcha powder is stronger but not the bitter type. Their matcha powder paired well with the subtle sweetness of their red bean. The ice cream was good as well. To some it might be on the sweeter but this is the matcha that I enjoy in my desserts. Their mochi is also nice and chewy. 

Other than their matcha red bean, I also tried their injeolmi which, when you dig into the bowl and get all the layers, have a strong soy bean powder taste. More on the lighter side but a great palate cleanser. Their shaved ice is nice and cold, airy and fluffy if that makes sense. 

Also tried their coffee which felt like breakfast cereal with a cup of coffee. Their ice cream was strong in espresso flavour and the cereal gave it a great crunch and texture. 

Lastly tried their black sesame and it was full of that fresh roasted black sesame taste. Rich flavours but the shaved ice is so light that it balances the richness.


Overall their bingsu was delicious and I would go back for them."}
{"text":"Tried out another Cups location, this time at First Markham Place. 

Came with a big group, so we had to wait a bit for enough tables to free up for all of us to be seated. I think the manager (maybe?) recognizes that a large group means $$$$, and really, there are other options around, so he ended up moving heaven and earth... ok just tables.. he moved tables around to make sure we can all be seated, even if it means obstructing a path to the exit.. now that's service!!!

Menu is like the other Cups location. Once you place your order at the counter, you get a buzzer that buzzes when your order is ready. This beats the Thornhill location where you have to listen to the staff call your name to pick up your order. 

Order green tea and cheese bingsu to share. Green tea was good. Not a fan of the cheese. Will come back to this location to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Its not bad and its not amazing. Not good enough for me to return though. Nice to try it out but would much rather recommend Snow Time on midland."}
{"text":"Delicious dessert. Ordered the black sesame bingsu to share with a friend. Small place with no table service. You go up to the counter and order, they give you a device with a number that will vibrate when your order is ready for pick up. They offer water and disposable cups on the side."}
{"text":"awesome shaved ice here. came here twice and the first time got the injeolmi shaved ice in a size large. I would give this 3/5 because it was pretty plain and it did have soy powder condensed milk and mochi . I did not like the soy powder because it was very dry and didn't taste yummy. but the mochi and condensed milk was good! the shaved ice here is very fine and small which makes it yummy. we had to ask for more condensed milk which they gave us for free since after the top layer the bottom layer is missing toppings . the second time I got the mango bing su in large it was very yummy and I would give it 4/5 stars. the condensed milk was layered throughout and the mangos were sweet and juicy and had cheesecake too. 
The atmosphere is good and has cute decoration but service is a little slow because there are a lot of customers"}
{"text":"Yaaasss. New location and it's great. Convenient location with ample parking, unlike the North York location. There's also significantly more seating in the shop. 

When you order, they give you a little wireless pager that vibrates and lights up when your order is ready. This is really handy when it's busy in there and there are bodies blocking the view of the counter. Although, you won't be holding onto it for very long, because I find these guys are a lot quicker filling orders than the other locations. 

As for the bingsu itself, it's all put together really nicely, and tastes great! It's Cups after all. I love Cups. 

Doesn't hurt that the people working here speak English (just an observation; doesn't make the bingsu any more or less delicious)

This is now one of my favourite places to go for dessert."}
{"text":"If only it were slightly cheaper, I'd give them that extra star, but it's still the best bingsoo I've had, and it's consistent.

We came yesterday after lunch and there was no one else inside. It was wonderful. It was nice and peaceful. We ordered the small black sesame bingsoo and swapped out our black sesame ice cream for matcha. It came to about $10 after tax.

The bingsoo wasn't made fresh. It was scraped out of a container. However, it was lump-free and Cups still has the fluffiest bingsoo. It's the closest thing to having powdered snow in your mouth. I appreciate that they layer the black sesame powder in-between the ice layers and they also put condensed milk between the layers as well. It was just a tad too sweet for me, but I don't have much of a sweet tooth. It was my first time having the black sesame flavor and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I'm a sucker for nutty foods, and this has a very strong sesame flavor. It also has sliced almonds and injeolmi on the top for some added texture. 

Water is self-serve. There's ice in the pitcher. Huh. The place is clean and the service is friendly. It's also open on Monday! We went to a number of places before this that weren't open. I have a feeling we'll be doing more Cups visits on Mondays during the day."}
{"text":"The Cups has now opened up shop at First Markham Place (in the space previously vacated by Sharetea). It is an authentic Korean dessert place specializing in bingsu, which is shaved ice topped with various ingredients such as sweetened condensed milk, mochi, red beans, cereal flakes and fruit. 

New to bingsu like me? The staff were helpful in explaining the most popular flavours (such as injeolmi and strawberry and tiramisu). There are 3 sizes of servings including small (served in a plastic cup) and two sizes of bowls, which are very shareable. I ordered the injeolmi cup, which was layered nicely with a good distribution of milk, condensed milk, mochi, roasted soybean powder, and shaved ice throughout. The very fine shaved ice mixed with the milk and soybean powder had the overall effect of tasting creamy and refreshing while the toasted almond flakes and mochi provided contrasting textures. We also ordered a fruit brick toast for my niece and nephew who enjoyed the fruits, whipped cream and ice cream but essentially left much of the soft bread untouched.

There is a self serve table for water. Those with lactose intolerance are mostly out of luck as most of the desserts contain milk, condensed milk, whipped cream or cheese in them. They could perhaps order some of the fresh fruit drinks or real fruit teas instead.

The space can accommodate some bigger groups of 6-8 people per table. We went mid afternoon on a Sunday and the 6 of us were able to seat ourselves easily. 

We came on the 3rd day of the Cups' soft opening. The service, food, and relative busyness of the place was not bad but again we came during non-peak hours. Looking forward to coming back to try either the green tea, cheese or tiramisu bingsu!"}
{"text":"My first bingsu was also at a Cups, but it was at a location that closed down... I think. And it wasn't great, so I was a little apprehensive when I came with my friends for dessert here. I mean... it's just ice.

I'm not a fan of soybean, mochi, or almonds (or ice), so I was EXTREMELY wary when my friend recommended this. She said it was the best one there, and she's a bingsu queen, so I figure I might as well trust. We're all pitching $3 so I mean... not much of a loss if I hate it.

It came out looking like a bowl of sand. Yay. 

It was actually great! It didn't taste like soybean much, and you can brush off the almond flakes, but they actually enhanced the flavour of the whole thing. The mochi gave the whole thing an interesting texture. Condensed milk was poured in layers over the shaved ice so it wasn't like you're just eating cold water. 

Together, I think it actually went pretty well. Condensed milk saved the dessert. I'm glad the ice was actually shaved ice and not like... ice slush? It didn't melt fast! I'd love to come back on a hotter day. 

The interior was cute and intimate with fake plants on the tables. Staff were alright. Defo reco for desserts. 

Just a tip: a small can serve 2-3 people. 2 people if you're both feeling something was lacking from dinner, 3 people if you all just want something small, as in, smaller than the cup size (because cups are also huge)."}
{"text":"Tried some new flavours today and it so good. At the same time I still really like the Injelomi bingsu. I love how they have a stamp system now. Get 10get 1 cup size free!!

It so delicious that I can't wait to get more! 10% discounts  for bingsu on mondays to Thursday before 6pm omg! I've gotten my discount for 3-4 times already

I finally tried their toast and omg it's sooo good! Injelomi toast!!! I want more!!!"}
{"text":"So happy to see that a cups has opened in Markham! It took over the sharetea location and thank goodness it did, that place did not deserve this location. Richard and his team at cups are doing great things and I can see it flourishing with business as summer comes along. C'mon, it's intense with biz now and it's cold af.

I found this to be my favourite location of cups out of the 3. Lots of seats, open concept space - no lines in your face as you are slurping bingsu like the yonge/steeles one. Service was stellar and they're very fast here. They even have little beepers to let you know when your bingsu is ready.

For some reason, the bingsu here is a bit better too. I always go for the mango, and this one comes FULL with large mango chunks on top of the fluffy ice. It's to die for. I don't have desserts often but when I do, it's gotta be cups. I don't know how people stuff themselves with cones on cones of artificially ice cream topped with diabetic filled candy when something as beautiful as cups is on their fingertips. I am a huge fan of non-sweet desserts like this. We also got drinks - the blueberry green tea is sparkling and again not sweet, just quenching. My boy had the earl grey latte which he loved a latte.... haha.. ha.. ok. Their drinks focus on quality not quantity. It's great!

We've ridden our motorcycle to cups when it's +27 out and we've shivered our way there when it's +4. Cups doesn't have a season.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"When I walked by it I had to do a double-take because I had no idea that Cups had put up their very own Markham location! Sure there are tons of things to love about the Yonge-Finch location -- most notably it's in an area also surrounded by delicious food places, there's great karaoke, and there's subway line 1. However, this new Markham location makes the commute all the more shorter (& sweeter) for me -- not to mention that this place is a lot bigger with lots of seats and tables -- a good cafe vibe.

Despite being 99% full with delicious noodles, my brother and I popped in and ordered a cup-sized matcha bingsu which comes with green tea ice cream, layers of condensed milk, mochi, red bean, and, almond flakes to share. Although cup-size is their smallest for bingsu, it's still quite a bit to eat and makes the perfect snack or dessert to a big meal. Only con I can think of is that, because it's cup-sized, there will be a bigger ratio of shaved ice to toppings so, if you're feeling up for it, I recommend getting the bowl sizes (they're great for sharing if you can't tackle it on your own!) and then mixing really well to get the flavours fusing with the shaved ice.

My brother and I are big matcha fans so I recommend this one for sure but I've also tried the cheese one which I am also going to recommend here because who doesn't like chunks of cheesecake mixed in with ice cream?"}
{"text":"Cups is a worthwhile addition to the growing Markham Bingsu scene. 

I loved the interior of this place, it's more spacious compared to their Thornhill location (there's a lot more tables and chairs!) and yet it's very cozy in here.

I have come here on numerous occasions and have tried the classic injeolmi, matcha, and mango bingsu and have found them all very tasty. The portion sizes are plentiful, they weren't overly sweet, and there were a decent amount of toppings. The injeolmi was wonderfully nutty while the matcha was strong and subtle. I definitely enjoyed the mango one the most here; big sweet mangoes topped with some delightful condensed milk. They're all excellent in the own ways.

What I found could be improved was the shaved ice itself, it could have been a bit more creamy and was on the drier side but it's still an excellent bingsu.

Despite being called 'small', there's enough portions in their small size to share between three people. So I'd recommend a cup size to share between two!"}
{"text":"A great dessert place in the area. The large portions are really big and can be easily shared between 2 people but will set you back $12-$13 for a bowl of ice. 

Came on a weekend evening around 6pm and it was quite empty. The decor is nice and a good place to catch up with friends for a little bit.

Between 4 people we got the mango and green tea. The ice itself was finely shaved, it was very soft like eating snow, no hard chunks here! But something about it seems repetitive by the last few bites  they do layer a bit of toppings in between which makes it good. The mango chunks were very frozen and didn't have too much flavor, it was biting into large chunks of ice. But it did have a lot of condensed milk. The matcha one had lots of red bean and matcha powder with a few mochi bites, lots of texture. 

Overall the place is good if you are craving shaved ice but not something I personally want regularly. The big pile makes it very visually attractive and perfect for the 'gram."}
{"text":"My fave spot for bingsu!  Especially love the Tiramisu and Green Grape.  Sleek and modern interior with outlets and free wifi make it an ideal coffice for freelancers like me.  Friendly service as well.  This spot has quickly become a popular space to chill and enjoy desserts in Markham!"}
{"text":"Great flavour combinations. No service really. Staff doesn't even bring your orders to your table nor collect your utensils / bowls afterwards. Meh overall."}
{"text":"Came here one evening as we heard there's a second location for Cups Bingsu.  The original to my knowledge is in Thornhill, whose interior looks completely different. The new location has an open concept, clean, contemporary and has an overall appealing ambiance.
As for dessert, we indulged Black sesame shaved ice which was a great choice.  Easily shareable for 2.....or 1 if you're feeling adventurous.   Overall their prices are reasonable and the service is great!
The only drawback to this place, like every restaurant in this plaza is \"parking\".  Better be quick during peak hours or you'll find yourself driving around for a bit lol."}
{"text":"Cups at FMP
Yes yes, bingsu in the house
Just here to chill out

Frosty delicious
Try their fruity brewed teas too
Bangin' flavour burst!

Busy in the night
Bright and airy in the day
Everything so nice"}
{"text":"Got the green tea bingsu and it was pretty good. Their mochi was different and it tasted slightly salty - which was interesting since it does not taste like normal mochi. 

The place was packed for a saturday night and there was not too many seatings. 

Would come back to try other bingsu flavours!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Korean Bingsu café. When you walk in, it's like you're in a Modern Korean Café with k-pop music to create the mood. The  staff are friendly and they have a variety of different flavours of Bingsu (korean style shave ice), cakes, coffee, teas, smoothies, frappés, toasts, cookies and Macarons. 

I had the injeolmi Bingsu and the ice is so soft that it feels like as if I'm eating freshly fallen snow that melts in your mouth with condense milk, soybean powder, mochi ans almond flakes. What can I say more? 

Owned by Koreans ensures you that you're getting the real thing with actual delicious authentic ingredients. I definitely fell in love with this place. There's definitely something for everyone. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the original location. 

Shaved ice had no flavor and shaved ice I saw was pre shaven from a Tupperware.

Flavours were ok. 

I do not recommend this location at all for bingsu."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this new Bingsu place that opened up at FMP after reading the reviews. This place doesn't disappoint. We got the Mango Bingsu and their portions are HUGE. Big chucks of mango with korean style milk shaved ice that was made perfectly. It tasted just like the ones I had in Korea; you taste more of the condensed milk rather than just ice. They have a variety of selections to choose from, making you want to come back again to try another bingsu."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just feel like something in mind would hit the spot. And on a hot summer night, Korean Bingsu was what I wanted and I truly appreciate Cups got it right. I'm not going to act like an expert but the menu brings me back to my visits to Korea and the taste was pretty spot on. I ordered the large Mango Bingsu and it was very filling though I paid a pretty penny for it. The only issue we had was, we waited about 20 mins for literally ... crushed ice and pour overs. Workers were slow even though I was the first order and a crap load of people coming in.

I look forward to trying out again flavors but only if I got time on my hands."}
{"text":"I've finally experienced bingsu at Cups and I can see why a lot of people have been raving about it. 

I came here on a Friday night and it was packed. Tables are first come first serve, which is the one thing I don't like about this place. Besides that there's so many people who just sit and talk even during peak hours when there are people waiting for a table. 

Because of that, my cousins and I all ordered take out cups instead and almost decided to enjoy our bingsu in the food court of fmp. 

We ordered injeolmi...(not sure if I spelled that correctly), red bean, and matcha. The bingsu reminded me of eating fresh snow because it was finely grind. The mochi's were my favourite because of how chewy it. The bingsu was layered evenly between the ice and the flavour, giving each spoonful a balanced taste. It was also not that sweet. 

Price wise was roughly $10, but the portions are big enough to be shared or devoured by yourself.

I'll be back to try out their other flavours."}
{"text":"If you love shaved ice then look no further, this is THE place to satisfy that craving! Despite the snowstorm outside, we couldn't find a better way to spend the night than eating a good looking bowl of bingsu. The cafe wasn't too big but there were still a good number of seats to sit down and enjoy your bingsu. I went on a Saturday night and managed to snatch seats but the place was pretty much packed shortly after. The bingsu comes in three sizes -a cup or small bowl or large bowl.  The small size was about $10/11 depending on the flavour. We ordered a small sesame bingsu and strawberry cheesecake bingsu. The sesame bingsu had almond slices, red bean and mochi bits on top. My favourite was hands down the sesame bingsu. I'm a fan of anything with back sesame and red bean. The strawberry one was average, nothing too special. I would probably try the green tea bingsu next time and the sesame again :')"}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (4 stars)
Lovely interior with tables and some counter height seating. Seats approximately 20 so it may be a bit of wait to get a table on busy nights. Parking at FMP is always a pain in the neck, however. 

SERVICE (4 stars)
There isn't much service offered. You order at the counter and they give you a pager when your order is ready to be picked up. There are some signs asking patrons to return used utensils/bowls to the counter after you finish eating. 

FOOD (5 stars)
This is where Cups shines. I've tried their Injeolmi and Green tea cups so far and while the green tea was good, we found it a little too sweet. The Injeolmi however is great for the occasional sweet tooth or dessert addict. I always pay an extra dollar to get more mochi. (They'll layer it three times!) 

QUALITY/VALUE (5)
Their cup size is around $7, which is enough to share, especially after a meal. They layer the toppings three times so you're not eating just pure ice at the bottom. This little detail really makes the bingsu so much more enjoyable. 

OVERALL 
5 stars"}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Friday afternoon (Holiday season, but Winter so not very many people at all) after lunch. Split a Bingsu with a couple of friends. Each bingsu is quite large and it really was enough for 3 people.

We had the Tiramisu Bingsu, which comes topped with a small slice of cake. The bingsu itself, which is the crushed ice was very light and creamy. Not sure exactly how it's made, but everything comes together very well. I think there was also a shot of espresso poured over it, which complemented well.

Will definitely come back to try other flavours."}
{"text":"This visit was the tail end of a mini food crawl through Markham and we were looking for something sweet but not too filling.

I've been to several places for bingsu but it was my first time at Cups. Like all the other places, you have to order and pick up at the counter.

I ordered the blueberry bingsu and my friend had the green grapes, both in small sized, served in cups. I have to admit, we ordered these for their photographic appeal as much as taste. There's nothing wrong with that, right?

They both tasted pretty good, even though our server forgot to make it with the cheesecake. She brought it over on a plate but it really didn't need it. The texture of the bingsu was so perfectly light and fluffy, almost like fresh snow. Everybody should try this."}
{"text":"FInally, good bingsoo! Service is fast and decor is cute. Just wish they had more toast options!"}
{"text":"We came here after a friend raved how good shave ice was in Hawaii, so we went to the next best thing... it turned out to be the worst best thing ever.

When we arrived... there were three employees in the back counter, none of them took a second to greet us and it took us about 10 minutes to grab one of their attention. Ridiculous.

The seating area was about 80% full but it is a small establishment, the guests of the desert shop were more welcoming and friendly, compared to the staff. The empty tables were disgustingly dirty, the employees didn't even bother to clean them. Guests had to clean them, themselves if they wanted to sit down.

While they were making our deserts, I noticed none of the girls had hair nets and their hair were fairly long and all over the place. I noticed they weren't washing their hands as often as they were suppose to. From putting things into the trash, back to making the edible deserts, to cross contamination with other foods.

I would give the desert I ordered a 1/5, they scored the single point because I love condensed milk, either then that, there was nothing special. Mango was extremely not ripe and sour, shave ice had no flavour which suppose to taste like mango, cheesecake bites were whatever.

Go elsewhere and treat yourself better to a sweet tooth craving."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced however very aesthetically appealing !! I personally really enjoyed the grape bingsoo.

They have coffee drinks, ice bingsoo, as well as some pastries.

It's a seat yourself style, so just come into the store order off the menu and wait for your buzzer to ring to get your food. 

Note: There are limited seating like 8 tables- however I can definitely see friends coming here and play board games."}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving some Bingsu dessert and sweets only to be met with upon arriving the location 20 minutes before closing, that they were closing... who closes a dessert place on a Saturday at 10:40pm ?? Makes no sense. They didn't even allow for a takeout either. 

So based on that, I can say that there were about 5 tables worth of people sitting as well. Perhaps they cleaned up the machine for shaved ice and figure that they can close early. 

Environment was looks nice but who knows, didn't get a chance to fully experience it having to travel 40 km to get here only to be met with \"it's closed\" 20 minutes before closing. 

This led to me going next door for desserts instead. As a matter of fact, about 4 other people after me encountered the same issue and went to the next door dessert too. AND ALOHA - these guys were open until 2 am. Competition shows that more business was then generated for the next store who actually remained open to their store hour times."}
{"text":"Went in today for shaved ice. I generally thought the place was relaxing but the products were too sweet for my liking. I know it's to be expected from a dessert place. If I were to go back again, I would order a drink item."}
{"text":"We decided to grab some desert have dim sum lunch.  We end up ordered the strawberry flavour desert and I can tell you it is very TASTY!!!.  It has fresh strawberry with mini cheese cake mix with shreded ice and milk.  It's sweet and just from the look, you want to eat it.  Definitely worth coming if you never been to this place.  I definitely come back again for more."}
{"text":"Great to share! Bought three large ones - green tea, black sesame, and tiramisu. All pretty good. Quick turnover."}
{"text":"Pretty much a copy of Snow Time which was the first korean shaved ice I tried. The shaved ice is done very well. Tried the coffee flavour which had a mix of cereal, mochi, coffee flavour and a scoop of coffee ice cream. The medium size was $11. The decor and atmosphere was dark and gloomy inside and was run by a single person when we went on a friday afternoon at about 1pm. Because there was only one person the service was slowed down as there was one table ahead of us. Also didnt like how dark it was inside which just made it depressing."}
{"text":"Cups is a dessert place for a \"bingsu\" which is a Korean style shaved ice. It kinda reminds me of the shaved ice at some Taiwanese places.

This is the type of place that's probably popular with millennials with IG worthy desserts. The ice itself is pretty good, it's very finely shaved and has a milky flavour to it - perhaps this isn't just ice, but a milk mix of some sort?

There are a variety of toppings and flavours you can get such as matcha, red bean, oreo, tiramisu, and so on. 

The dessert is good, it does look nice, but honestly it's just not $10 good."}
{"text":"All good things comes to those who can wait! 

This is my 2nd visit to this location with an additional visit to the North York location (which is now closed). Bingsu is national dessert in South Korea and variations of the original red bean with ice and milk. 

On this visit, I was craving for injeolmi and ordered the cup size. The ice is so fine and pillow-y, the pieces of chewy tteok (Korean's version of mochi) strategically layered and generous with powdered bean and slivers of almonds make this worth the visit - even when it's cold outside!!

Unlike the now closed North York location, this one didn't have any savoury offerings, but shaved ice and cakes are a plenty."}
{"text":"Had the green grape shaved ice. Compared to what I had in Hong Kong before, it is just okay. The ice is fine and milky. Will go back and try other flavors."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends late at night. We wanted to go to mabu generation but the line was too long. The cups was next door and had a lot of vacant seating. It filled up quickly though! As soon as we sat down, people came filing in for their evening dessert. Every seat became occupied and the servers eventually asked us to leave so they could seat the next group. Crazy because it was freezing cold outside that day. My friends were hesitant to even get shaved ice. 
The servers don't even come out behind the counter often. They give you a buzzer so you pick up your tray of stuff when it's ready. The water is also self serve which is located at the entrance.
The decor is nice, spacious, and very cute. They have free WiFi too! There's a sign with the password: this place is highly self serve, haha.
My friend got a red bean bun and some kind of latte. The bun was surprisingly warm and soft like a traditional Asian bun. It was very delicious.
We ordered a medium sized Tiramisu and (something else, forgot the name. Has mochi and Korean bean powder). Both were fantastic. The texture is like dry snow. I liked the Tiramisu because the addition of expresso made it more liquid and creamy. Some of my other friends preferred the more dry Korean bowl. The desserts are also very pretty and reasonably priced! I guess because they saw we had a group, they also gave us small Styrofoam cups to spit the larger bowls with. That was nice. In addition, the water cups are non reusable thin plastic cups. I would really like to see this establishment use reusable serving bowls and cups instead of stuff that they throw out after one use. Especially since they must go through hundreds each day.
Overall, I would return to try other flavours."}
{"text":"Great dessert cafe at First Markham Place. However a second visit ended up is disappointment as they closed a little earlier than stated. We arrived at 10:40pm on a Saturday to find it was closing. 

I understand they must have washed the machines already so didn't want to process another order. So we went next door to Sugar Marmalade and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was in search of a new bingsu place since snowbowl in hmart richmond hill relocated to toronto. Found this place on yelp ironically and gave it a try. 

When you first walk in, you take in the quaint and comfortable atmosphere. It's bright, there's tables and the ambiance made you want to stay. It was one of those places where you ordered first at the counter, waited for your bingsu to be prepared and pick up via vibrating handheld machine. 

I wasn't sure what I was expecting but the menu and the photos showed quite traditional bingsu's.  What I love about this place is that the bingsu is light and melts in your mouth. It's powdered snow, not shaved ice or ice cream. 

Now, I enjoy my desserts on the less sweet side. The bingsu doesn't have flavor in it. It's the toppings that make the dessert. We ordered the green tea, mango and the black sesame bingsu. 
The large feeds 3 people comfortable. The small would feed 2 and they have a cup option as well which showcases layers of goodness in a transparent cup. 

The greentea bingsu has pieces of tender and soft mochi, a good amount of anko and a scoop of green tea ice cream to top it off. The whole bowl is then covered with matcha powder. This was a perfect balance of sweet and definitely a great introduction to cups.

The black sesame was similar in layers except the sesame powder was also mixed in with lots of sugar. It tasted very much like a sesame paste dessert... except not hot and gooey. I found it to be definitely on the sweeter side, maybe a bit too sweet. 

Last but not least we ordered the mango for some freshness. Layers of mango pieces, mango purée and cheesecake topped this bingsu. Mangoes were frozen, but it can't be helped since it's not the season for it. Refreshing but again also on the sweeter side of things. 

They make lattes as well - green tea latte has lots of sugar in it, earl grey latte has none. I wish they gave us an option of sugar levels. They also only use one type of milk so if you're a picky milk drinker, this may not be the latte place for you.

Overall, I love this place. It hits a craving and I can't wait to come back and try more. Parking is atrocious though - cups is right beside mabu, which is beside sugar marmalade and din tai Fung. So be prepared to do circles in the parking lot."}
{"text":"YUUUMM! It was my first time trying bingsu and The Cups definitely exceeded my expectations!

I ordered the Cup sized Green Grapes flavour and my friend ordered the Green Tea flavour. I love that the bingsu had multiple layers of shaved ice, green grape purée, and green grapes. The workers were extremely patient and friendly! 

I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Used to really like this place but the last few times it's really not living up to expectations. Tables are not clean. There's no music playing or it's super quiet. And they increased the prices too. So... can I buy better desserts elsewhere? Yeah probably."}
{"text":"Average food and drink for a bit expensive price. Just because they make the food and drink look nice, it doesn't mean they taste delicious, just acceptable quality, nothing special. However the staffs were nice at the time I visited, so one extra star for them. The place is good for groups and families with children."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of The Cups! So glad they opened a bingsu cafe at First Markham Place, located where ShareTea used to be!

Not only are the bingsu beautifully made (with love!), they also tasted light and fluffy! I would highly recommend the Tiramisu bingsu and the light x classic Injeolmi bingsu (aka Korean mochi dusted with soy bean powder) - those two are my favourite!

If you thoroughly enjoy Injeolmi like I do, Cups also offers an Injeolmi Toast on the menu :D! The melted mochi is sandwiched between the toasts like a grilled cheese sandwich lol. It is a bit on the sweet side but if you want something filling AND you have a sweet tooth... this toast is perfect for you ;)

Tables are first come, first serve! I think the best time to come is that awkward time slot late afternoon before dinner lol. I came on a Sunday around 4:30pm and got the last table! Shortly around 5pm... whole place was empty! Until 6:30-7pm, it picked back up again.

I will definitely be back again! So far I've tried Green Tea, Black Sesame, Tiramisu, Injeolmi, and Green Grape (I'm not a big fan of grapes but it looks pretty good for the gram!). Can't wait to come back and try Coffee, Cheese and Mango ^^"}
{"text":"I got the classic Injeolmi shaved ice and while I liked the fact that it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, I didn't enjoy the texture much (since it's basically a soy-based powder) which melts in your mouth with the soft ice.

That being said, the shaved ice was fluffy and soft
and I am keen to try some more \"liquid-based\" flavours instead.

The wait for the shaved ice was surprisingly longer than I would've expected. There's a handful of tables and overall, makes for a good casual dessert spot!"}

{"text":"So ive recently been obsessed with bingsu! Love it way better than Japanese or Taiwanese shaved ice. Bingsu is so fluffy and light and flavourful depending on what you choose. I can have a full one all by myself after dinner! That being said, ive been to a few different places around town. 

What I ordered:
Red bean bingsu
Coffee bingsu
Green tea smoothie
Blueberry lemonade 

Heard so many good things about Cups. Saw the lines every time i get dinner next door. But i have to say im a little disappointed. Idk if it was the flavours i got, but i just didnt like it as much as the other places ive visited. The coffee flav is one that the other places didnt carry. So i had to try it. The shaved ice was nowhere near as fluffy. The coffee flav was blend and too many crunchy cereal making it so dry. Red bean one had nothing special to it either. The two drinks were also meh. I like the idea of their little bar where u can help yourself with water and sugar/syrup (might be for the coffee. Not sure) but i dont think im coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This a café is located at the First Markham Place plaza, outside the mall, and next to Entrance E. There are also lots of parking spots in the vicinity.  

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Staff were friendly and personable. Our order took quite a long time to prepare, but I understand it was really busy that night. Good thing we got a restaurant pager that vibrates when our order was ready. So, that was pretty cool. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5
Earthy vibes with wooden furniture and vibrant green plants scattered around the café. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5
High-quality ingredients. Usually, I think price of Bingsu is too high for something that is predominately made of water. However, Cups matches the value of the dessert to its price as they layer toppings a couple times with shaved ice at the bottom of the bowl. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
Black Sesame Bingsu (Large) - $12.99: includes black sesame powder, mochi, sweet red bean, almond flakes, and black sesame ice cream. Black sesame powder had a very subtle flavour, and was not sweet. Mochi was a little hard, probably because the cold shave ice hardened the mochi. The sweet & satisfying red bean was THE BEST PART of this dessert. Almond flakes added a nice crunch, and black sesame ice cream was nutty and refreshing. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
Overall, the mochi was just a little too hard, but the other textures, layers, and components of this dessert complemented one another quite well."}
{"text":"Only 10 days past and I've already been to this place 3 times! So addictive! 
I've tried mango, strawberry, green grape, matcha, black sesame, tiramisu. The fruit ones are in smaller cups than the flavoured ones, but they are all pretty large.
Would recommend black sesame and tiramisu the most, and go with a group of friends like I did if you want to try multiple flavours!"}
{"text":"it wasn't a busy evening at all, only one order being made before ours, yet it took 40mins for a cup size to be made.  i've had way better injeolmi shaved ice at Soul Cafe, so this review is in comparison to it.  Cups' shaved ice is just as fine and smooth, but not milky like i've had at Soul Cafe.  both places have the same toppings give the right amount (soybean powder, shaved almonds, mochi, condensed milk).  i do like that Cups layers them in between so that you get a nice mixture.  you have the option to have it to-go and there are 3 diff sizes to choose from, but for the price of a cup ($7.90) here, you can get a size bigger at Soul.  despite not being completely sold on this place, they do have another flavour i'd come back to try - hopefully it won't take just as long to make."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. It is located right where the short lived Share Tea was. Place is really cute with lots of (fake) plants for instagrammable photos. Surprised to see the menu offering way more than just bingsu - including coffee, cakes and other desserts. 

I've tried the black sesame and injeolmi bingsu. Black sesame was 10/10, they added the right amount of black sesame powder to complement the red bean and mochi. The bingsu texture was also better than other bingsu places I've tried in Toronto. More flaky and it wasn't all melted by the time you got to the bottom. Injeolmi was a 7/10 for me, which surprised me because I was really excited for it. The flavor came out too sweet, with too much condensed milk that sadly melted away the lovely little flakes of bingsu. There also wasn't that much almond toppings compared to Snow Time's injeolmi which has copious amounts of almonds. 

Tip: get the black sesame bingsu, it's amazing. If you want injeolmi, ask for condensed milk on the side."}
{"text":"The place just opened recently and was packed even just an hour before closing! Everything in the menu looked very appetizing and well designed, as well as the decor of the shop, which is very clean and modern. 
Waiting time took a while as it was very packed that night, but the staff was very nice and accommodating to our large group.

Food wise, we tried the Original Injeolmi (rice cake), Tiramisu, as well as the Green Tea bingsu. Honestly, they were all pretty mediocre to me. I prefer the bingsu at Café Bene on Yonge & Finch more because their ice has a very prominent milk taste and not the watery taste. Towards the end of the bingsu, all I tasted was watered down ice since all the toppings were already eaten, it was basically tasteless. They have a great range of flavors and toppings but they definitely can improve their bingsu recipe, as the base is very important as well.

Love the little touches and attention to detail that this place offers. They have little cups at the front where you can take some sweeteners like honey with you free of charge! 

Have not tried their other food options like the toast  or their drinks yet but for sure will come back again after they settle down more and have a chance to improve their menu!"}
{"text":"Cups is definitely Insta famous so I had to come in to give them a try.  They are in the old Sharetea location (right beside Mabu).

They somewhat updated the décor and it's super cute with tables & this long counter with these little plants.  The place was bright and clean.  There weren't a lot of people so there was absolutely no wait (but this might be because it was Chinese New Year and everybody stayed home)

Menu was pretty straightforward.  I got the mango bingsuu and earl grey latte.  We were handed a beeper which went off when the food was ready for pickup at the front counter.

They took about 5-8 minutes to make everything.

The bingsuu was good.  I loved mixing it so all the flavours melted together.  They gave a good amount of mangoes but they were somewhat sour :(  Overall.  It wasn't a bad experience but I feel like Snow Time on McNiccoll and Finch was creamier and fluffier.  

I was also about to chuck my latte out of the car as it felt like I was drinking warm milk.  I let my boyfriend try and he downed the whole thing.  Said it as amazing.  

The total came up to roughly $16."}
{"text":"Seems like they are moving a lot of north york eats to Markham! I've been to the one at north york and thornhill, looks like this location has a lot more selection of bingsu.

Injeolmi Bingsu ($11 for large)
Milk shaved ice layered with condensed milk, soybean powder, chewy mochi and almond flakes. It's big, good to share between 2. Normally, other places just serve a mountain of shaved ice and a single layer of toppings on top as the flavour which I always end up asking for more condensed milk. But here, in between the milk shaved ice there was a layer of soybean flavoured shaved ice making the shaved ice flavourful from top to bottom. Super tasty!! Also, because its shaved ice this dessert feels super light, not fattening at all....*rolls eyes*

I'd like to come back and try the cheese flavor."}
{"text":"Following in the footsteps of its franchise siblings, Cups at FMP is also quite good. This location is dimmer but cleaner and more spacious than the Yonge and Steeles location. Offerings are near identical, offering the same delicious and sweet bingsu. Our orders were made quite efficiently. I ordered the strawberry, small size as a nice follow up to the pho I had from across the street. Ice cream, cubes of cheesecake, layers of glazed strawberry slices and glorious of shavings. The wall is quite bare though; could use a nice colourful HAHAHA."}
{"text":"The First Markham Cups location is a very popular place on weekend evenings and can feature a 15-20 min wait for your order, regardless of whether you're sitting in or taking out. The bingsu is pretty good though, especially their Injeolmi, Tiramisu, Coffee, and Cheese flavours. The quality of the ingredients used is apparent in the flavours. However, at around $11.30 for a small-size bingsu, it is quite pricey. It's fine once in a while as a treat, and not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try bingsu for a long time, and happened to mention that this place had opened up while eating with a couple of friends near by. We decided to drop by for a quick dessert and chat, and I'm sure glad we did! 

As parents with young kids we know that there is only a small window that you can really stop by a restaurant with large strollers in tow and not bother the other patrons. Fortunately when we arrived around 3:30 on a Sunday there was space for us. 

The menu is nice and compact with photos and descriptions of the variety of desserts/beverages they serve. My friends ordered coffee's, which I imagine was nothing too special as this is not their specialty. After browsing the menu, we decided on the mango, black sesame and coffee bingsu's in cup size. The servings are quite large even for the smallest size! Our friends wife actually told her husband that he ordered the wrong one for her as she wanted \"the smallest\" one.  The staff made the bingsu relatively quickly after we placed our orders, providing a cute little pager that they rang once everything was ready. Presentation was adorable as the bingsu was perfectly layered and swirled just as the pictures from previous reviewers had shown. The mango bingsu had large chunks of mango along with pieces of cheesecake that perfectly complimented the flavour. The black sesame had swirls of black sesame layered in between the snow, along with some mochi and red bean on the top to add more dimension to the flavour. The coffee bingsu had a wonderful bitter tone through the espresso syrup, it also had some cereal bits which added a nice texture to each bite. The milk flavoured snow is quite fluffy and nice, however the dessert did end up being a bit too sweet for my taste. It seemed like there may have been condensed milk or some sort of added sweetener in between the layers of snow that just made some bites cloyingly sweet. Overall, I'm very happy with my visit to the cups, and will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Good presentation. Interesting idea but didn't seem worth the price point. My taro latte was half foam."}
{"text":"Bingsu, my favourite Korean dessert. So light so fluffy just like the first snowfall....

I had been to the other 2 locations of The Cups and loved it. And I am so glad they open up in First Markham Place!

I came here on a weekday afternoon so the place was almost empty with just 2 other tables.. Sadly, they were so understaffed with only 1 girl working. The wait for my order was long but luckily I was not in a rush. (- 0.5 star)

I usually order the Cup size which is perfect size. I usually go for Injeolmi and Sesame and they never disappointed.

I will be back."}
{"text":"I think I can have cups everyday and not get sick of it. For their bingsu, I've tried strawberry, matcha, green grape, mango, injeolmi, black sesame, coffee, tiramisu, and blueberry... so almost everything :D

My favourites are strawberry and injeolmi and I literally recommend these to everyone I know. So good! Not too sweet - perfect for my Asian tastebuds. The ice is so finely milled and has the best consistency. I love how they layer all the ingredients so you're not left with just ice when you get to the bottom of your cup. Presentation is nice and not messy like some other bingsu places."}
{"text":"I met up with a couple of friends here and was surprised to see how busy this small little cafe was. We met up pretty late at night and it was freezing out, so I can only imagine how busy this place will be on a hot day. I ordered the black sesame bingsu (shaved ice) and couldn't finish it cause they gave such a generous portion. My friend ordered the injoelmi toast and loved it! Cups Bingsu Café is definitely a great place to grab dessert after a meal; it's conveniently located in a plaza with a ton of food options. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is due to the long wait time for the actual items to come out; however, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend. It was pretty packed! Food was good, but compare with the other Yonge location the ice cream portion is smaller. However, store is more modern and nicely renovated than the Yonge location. 

If you are coming with a big group, it might be a long wait for seats. They also provide a buzzer for customer when waiting for orders, which is pretty high tech for a dessert restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious bingsu, tried it for the first time here and I was greatly surprised. The texture is so strange for ice, it is like fluffy. I tried the Tiramisu and Strawberry bingsu and they were both delicious! The strawberries were and plentiful. The cake on the tiramisu is not the highlight of the dish. 

The service is great, they are quick and friendly. You do have to serve yourself, which I do not mind. 

Highly reccomment !!"}
{"text":"Great environment for shaved ice. It is clean and decor nicely and not too flashy or crammed. Ordered the black sesame shaved ice and enjoyed it over some of the other places that I have been to because of one thing. They took the time to make it so it was layers of shaved ice and layers of topping, whereas other place just dump the shaved ice on the bottom and toppings right on top. 

Definitely worth checking out again for other flavours."}
{"text":"Finally have some bingsoo uptown.
I really enjoy the Taiwanese shaved ice, but this is definitely on its own level. 

Came with a grind and we got two bingsoos, one green tea and one tiramisu. After ordering, it took a bit of time for them to make our order. They would give you one of those call machines, and you can sit and chat until they're ready for you.

The bing soo was real delicious. The ice was extremely finely shaved, so it was like scooping up rice. Each spoonful was really easy to scoop up, and how they layered everything made it really flavourful, despite the ice not being flavoured. 

One thing we noticed was that green tea ice cream was a big small, looked stingy. That's my only complaint. But other than, the desserts were delicious. Looking forward to trying the drinks and the cakes next."}
{"text":"I feel like I'd be doing a great disservice to the world if I gave this place a 3 star rating, so it's a 4 but it's really a 3.5 at this moment. I'm no stranger to The Cups, I've been to the Yonge and Finch location a few times but the one on Yonge and Steeles is ma main crib. I've been there so many times that my friends joke that I could single handedly keep their business alive (there was one summer where I went there everyday after work, I kid you not). 

My favourite is the injeolmi shaved ice and while I've tried most of their other flavours, this one is the one that keeps me coming back. I'm not a fan of mochi but it's a nice blend with the injeolmi. Like the other locations, there are ingredients layered between the shaved ice so it maintains the flavour. 

Now what I didn't like from this location: the milky flavour they have in their ice is barely noticeable, whereas the other two locations had a distinct milky taste, this place was so lacklustre it tasted just like regular snow. I only noticed it halfway digging through it because of the excessive amount of condensed milk they drizzled over and buried underneath. The amount of condensed milk was a killer towards the end of it. Way, waaay too much. I left the store with a nasty feeling at the back of my throat. Not even water could remedy it for a while. 

Service was lovely though, just like at the other two locations. Their decor is very trendy and hipster, and it's always nice to walk into a clean atmosphere. 

I would definitely come back -- once they settle down in this location. For now, I'll return to ma crib on Yonge and steeles but I do see myself coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Today was their soft opening and I was so glad to have stumbled upon this place! They have a wide variety of bingsu, from the classic Asian flavours such as green tea, to fancier ones such as Tiramisu and fruit-based types. Their bingsu comes in 3 sizes: cup (smallest), small bowl, and a large bowl. 

Personally, I had the small Tiramisu bingsu, which came with an espresso shot to pour over the dessert. It came with a good slice of Tiramisu cake and generous amounts of cocoa powder and chocolate chips at the bottom of the bowl. It was absolutely delicious!

If you're not feeling as hungry, you could also get the cup size, which is carefully layered to ensure you get a good mix of all of the ingredients in every bite. I tried the Injeolmi (recommended by the staff, which is a traditional Korean flavour of roasted soybean), which also had a nice balance. 

In addition to bingsu, you can also get espresso- and fruit-based drinks, and brick toast (one of the big trends in the Asian dessert scene). While I didn't have room to try it, I would love to try it next time I swing by. 

The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was nice and classy. If you're a fan of KPop, they blast the latest hits while you enjoy your stay. It's so nice to finally have a good Korean bingsu place in Markham!"}
{"text":"So I finally got to visit The Cups. So glad I did loved it!

Location:
In First Markham Place in the old Sharetea spot

Parking:
Ok. Yeah is a mall in the suburbs and there's a tonne of parking but omg parking is insane. Go with someone who will drop you off and go park. Seriously you don't need the parking stress!!

Decor:
Its very nice, the walls are a very classy rich blue with wood wainscoting. Its a smallish space, the prep area takes up a big chunk of space. Very necessary!

Seating is table and chairs, there's also a bar.  Its a nice comfortable place. Good to come with friends and nice enough for date night. 

The Goods:
We had the grape, the strawberry, and green tea bingsu as well as a red bean latte. I did not try the latter but it smelled fantastic and my friend said it was great. 

The strawberry bingsu came with red bean ice cream and had small chunks of cheesecake in with the strawberries.  That dish disappeared in a flash, so I'd say it was pretty fantastic. 

I had the grape bingsu. I've been seeing  pictures of it online and made it my mission to get that in my belly. Loved it! Omg it was so good. Fresh sweet green grapes, smooth vanilla ice cream, pureed grape mixed in, delicious. Had wine notes ( of course it is grapes) and the shaved ice part so refreshing, mixed with milk. Yum. 

Staff:
Jen and Michelle behind the counter were so nice, they also made the goods so great job!!!

Conclusion:

I'll be back, sitting at a table scarfing down a strawberry and a green grape bowl of goodness"}
