{"text":"Really satisfying cheap thai. Decent pho, good stir fries and spring rolls. Cash only."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!  My fav pho place and pad Thai chicken curry. Cash only establishment, but the prices are great.  Dishes are usually under $10 and portions are massive!"}
{"text":"Go here when I need a good heart soup, Nothing fancy, but also not overly salty, or oily.   It is clean, the food tastes fresh, and the service is prompt. CASH ONLY!!!!   I get the rare beef, or chicken soup normally with a vegetarian spring roll. Dinner for two will run you 20 bucks or so.   Have fun!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! I often come to this restaurant every now and then and they never disappoint. The pricing is cheep which is good for customers who are a foodie, like myself. In the day there aren't many customers but in the night it gets busy and still the service is fast which is good. My favourite dishes that I always order are Vegetable Spring Rolls (Cha Giò Chay) and Chicken Pho Noodle Soup.  If you love Pho Restaurants as much as I do then this is the place for you! I suggest you come visit and see for yourself. The only thing I'd say (in which I'm not a fond of) is this restaurant only takes Cash. But overall, it's a nice and delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here. The cold rolls had deli style sliced chicken in them. After complaining about the quality. They were still billed to us. Pho was bland, and noodles tasted like they'd been sitting on a shelf for 3 years and the meat was neither rare, nor cooked that day.  Also had the lemongrass spicy soup was badly seasoned.  Revoltingly bad. Avoid."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho place.. I don't eat red meat so I've never tried the beef soups, but the chicken one is Amazing. I would recommend this place for vegetarians as well, they have a lot of vegetarian and  seafood options. I go here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Gotten food from here several times with my husband.  First couple of times we only got take-out, just ate in house there tonight.  I'm not an expert on Vietnamese food so I can't speak to how their Rare Beef Pho compares to what I would get at a good place in Viet Nam, but I will say that I love Pho Rang Dong's version.  The broth is flavourful, the beef is tender, the noodles...well they're just noodles- pretty hard to screw up- but in any case they're good too.  The portion is huge and comes with plenty of lime, sprouts, cilantro, and Thai basil to add as you like.  Veggie spring rolls are decent- crispy, tasty, a bit greasy maybe, but they're not meant to be eaten as a main course.  My husband and I have only ever eaten the pho and veggie rolls, although tonight I ordered a soursop milkshake.  I've never had soursop anything so I didn't know what to expect, but it turned out delicious.  Husband gives the place a \"meh\" review, says it's acceptable but he's definitely had better, and yet he doesn't seem to mind getting food from here time and again.  He's a fan of the large portions and low prices, and after tonight stated that he found the food better when eaten there rather than the times we had it to go.  For me, when I need a big steaming bowl of comforting, healthy, delicious soup to warm my tummy, this place nails it."}
{"text":"Très bonne surprise de trouver ce resto viet à 2 pas de chez mon amie qui m'héberge depuis mon arrivée à Toronto. Le prix du phô est imbattable à 6$. Vous retrouverez les classiques de la gastronomie viet ici. Le personnel est très gentil et rapide. Ne soyez pas surpris, ici on inscrit soi même sa commande sur un carnet avec la quantité désirée, pratique. Restau très propre, nickel."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed by the pho here. They didn't have any options with tendon or tripe, and I found the broth to be bland and the meat chewy. The spring rolls were very good, though.   The other diners were all eating non-soup dishes, so maybe that's where their strength lies.  Cash only."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered the grilled chicken and rice, the curry chicken and rice and mixed vegetables with chicken and rice that came with a small soup (more like broth) and a small iceberg lettuce with onion and tomato and cucumber salad. Honestly, the meals are very simple an very bland, and the curry chicken and mixed vegetables was oily as well. The grilled chicken is literally two grilled chicken breasts with possibly some salt and pepper. Definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"went there once and got their pho soup noodles. It's the worst one I've had. The chicken tasted expired and the noodle was soggy. Never again."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place. It doesn't look like much of a nice restaurant but their pho soup is amazingly flavourful! Very authentic tasting compared to other places."}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner here with my gf and we had the pho, spring rolls and salad rolls. When eating pho it's all about the broth and this broth had no flavour. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly was not good. Salad rolls were not fresh. The only decent thing was their spring rolls. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my gf. The place is fairly authentic. In their menu, they don't just call any soup Pho. They have bun in soup which is not very common. The pho broth has a cleaner taste and not so fatty. Reminds me of the pho in vietnam. They also keep the oyster sauce in the fridge which is a change from all other pho places. Their \"special\" also contains chicken instead of tripe which I think is a welcomed change. There was also ample meat in my XL bowl which is unusual. The place itself is nothing special. Fairly standard pho place."}
{"text":"I do not have the traditional PHO meal when I come here.   The lady and gentleman who run this place are extremely friendly and very attentive. The food is delicious, inexpensive and the atmosphere is very cozy and nice.  I usually get a very non traditional pho meal, (grilled chicken, rice and salad). With two pieces of deliciously grilled chicken, steamed rice and a yummy house salad, you are only look at spending $9- INSANE.  The veggie spring rolls are extremely yummy (large portion) very crispy. We have also had multiple hot plates (the beef and chicken hot plate is delicious and well seasoned- vegetables are steamed perfectly.)  The only disappointment is their sweet chili thai sauce (it's very watery and doesn't do much as a sauce).  This is a great choice for an inexpensive dinner option."}
