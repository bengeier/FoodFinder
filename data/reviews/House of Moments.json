{"text":"Finally got to sit down and write about H.O.M.'s .  Have already been there twice since their opening, both during the week and enjoyed it both times.  The front door to this place is unpretentious, one could easily miss it, but once inside, wow, elegant & sophisticated, as is the attire of the wait staff.  We enter & the hostess greets us, & another coat check attendant takes our jackets, both very friendly.  The wait staff are just as nice, with a special shout out to Gigi, she waited on us the first time & was amazing.  The second visit, she remembered my name, and even though she didn't serve us the second time, she came by to say \"hello\".  Now onto the food.  We ordered: The Beet Salad.  nice variety of beets, arugula & goat cheese.  Nice presentation & more important everything was fresh.  Just a small note to add, the goat cheese was so smooth & tasty.  The Spicy Tuna Roll Blue Lagoon Roll.  soft shell crab was crunchy, & tasty, probably made to order ... like it should be!, can't stand the idea of pre-made deep fried crab.  The Hawaiian Volcano Flambe Roll.  This is my favourite. The dish is presented on a cast iron like grill with the roll in the centre & then there are two pod like things at each corner that are set on fire.  The flame from the fire heats the bonito flakes, which I might add is so flavourful.  The only downside is the cost of the $21 pricetag that it comes with it.  But still obviously worth it, because I've ordered it twice already.  Beef Tenderloin.  So tender, melt in your mouth, I needn't say more!  Wild Sea Bass.  Flaky, cooked perfectly! wasn't too sure about the beet sauce though.  Some kind of Ginger Tini.  Nice refreshing drink.  Hot Green Tea.  I know, why mention something so simple as the tea.  Our tea came in a cast iron pot, STEAMING HOT & NOT watered down, seen too often in other sushi places.  Green Tea Creme Brulee.  Not bad, would've like to see the macaroon replaced with another accompaniment though.  My final thoughts.  CONSISTENCY.  FRESHNESS .  RICE TO FISH RATIO ROLLS.  Those are three good reasons why I return."}
{"text":"We thought we would give it a try and bought a Groupon voucher.  Finally went and overall the decor, space and layout is quite exceptional.  No wonder they do many events.  Quite taken by that and the presentation of the food.  While we did order off a limited menu, portions were a good size.  Tempura was not greasy and beet salad fresh.  Good start.  Sea bass entree, again good size portion tasted a little off, a little too fishy and not in a good way and the sides, veggies and mashed potatoes were tepid at best.  Staff was fine, server in training so cut him a little slack but when 1/2 an entree is left on a plate, as a server, you should really wonder about its quality or if the guest was not happy.  Signature maki set was huge and well enjoyed.  Would give this place another shot."}
{"text":"A great space, chillin' music with awesome cocktails and some of the best maki rolls in town.    The menu is extremely creative, the food beautifully presented and delicious. The bartender has created some great cocktails with lots of fresh juices that compliment the food perfectly.  It missed the last star only because the food desired more polished service."}
{"text":"Very cool place (KEEP READING). Outside of downtown and everyone in our party that drove found free parking (Saturday night). Very cool decor! Love the art gallery feel and the collection of doors from around Asia were amazing. BUT... food (which very well decorated) was mediocre for the price point. Very sushi-based menu but the sushi was... sushi; nothing to justify the price. My biggest complain was that my boyfriend who doesn't drink ordered a \"virgin Caesar\" which cost $9... my cocktail cost $9... not okay. A virgin Caesar is basically the same category as a pop... very disappointed in the place when I saw the bill: $18 for two glasses of Clamato."}
{"text":"This place is super unique - lounge / restaurant. The decor was stunning - huge doors from Cambodia, Thai sculptures, and art gallery. There was even a dance class going on in the other room while we were here. They host events - this would be a wicked place for a larger 50+ person event.   It's got a bit of a pretentious feel to it - definitely dress up for this place. Kind of expensive for food, but it was worth the experience."}
{"text":"Tasty! Lil bit on the pricey side. What I really liked about the restaurant was the decor... Very beautiful and offers a unique ambience. Tried just about everything on the menu and it was all very good. No complaints. Sashimi is not bad, but not equivalent to the caliber of freshness at a high end sushi restaurant. No complaints on service... everything was good."}
{"text":"Not too crazy with the Venue. Literally looks like a factory that was renovated yesterday just slab some paint on the walls and brought in paintings and sculptures to make the place look like a somewhat gallery. Dont get me wrong at least do some work to the flooring it looks like my public school gymnasim. But what was interesting they have after 10 on saturday it turns into a lounge they were hosting 2 local artist from Toronto and was exhibiting their artworks.  The presentation of their food was absolutely stunnning. Must try their tako yaki fried octopus balls have to be the best one I tried yet made perfectly. We also had the Snow White Roll was freaking amazing. As for the main entree I had the lamb chops perfectly made. Only upsetting thing was the dessert which I was really looking forward to the matcha green tea creme brulee which was the worst ive ever tried! I recommend you not to even try to eat any desserts!"}
{"text":"We went to the House of Moments for the first time on Nov 27, 2014 for dinner with friends. My friend and I shared the Persian Roll and the Butter Curry Roll. After eating, my friend and I were both violently ill. Also, I later found out that the Butter Curry Roll had salmon in it, an ingredient that was not listed on the menu. All the ingredients listed for this menu item were vegetarian....hence I ordered it. The manager on duty (Jiji) lacked the professionalism and customer service I expected from this sort of venue. She handled the situation extremely poorly, initially taking no responsibility. Please share my post so others don't experience what we did."}
{"text":"This sushi-asian fusion restaurant has a pretty unique warehouse basement/art gallery space thing going on in terms of decor and vibe. With constant strange down tempo house music playing, a large (mostly empty) basement location covered in a mish mash of random asian decoration, and an art gallery space in the back full of (unfortunately pretty boring when I went) paintings, this place was pretty unique.  I was a little wary of the food when we came in because there were only 3 groups (including mine) there on a Friday night. Fortunately, the kitchen turned out some fresh and well made sushi and appetizers. The edamame appetizer was prepared differently than I'd had before with sesame oil and seeds replacing the usual light salting and making this simple dish much richer and tastier. Nice idea! I'll steal it at home. The vegetable and shrimp tempura was alright. A little on the greasy side, but still tasty. Sushi itself was pretty fresh tasting and well prepared. We ordered the spicy plate (spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and Russian: jalepeno, salmon, etc.) and they were all good.  Later in the evening we noticed the bartender lighting stuff on fire...uh, naturally this grabbed our attention and we ended up ordering a dozen shots of his choice which resulted in us getting the entire 20' counter lit on fire and 12 pretty awesome mixed shots. Pretty cool. Highlight of the evening.  Also, lots of sake! Haha, always good with sushi. The experience was a little uneven/weird on occasion and everything did seem slightly too expensive, but I wouldn't be averse to coming back here with some friends if they chose it if only to make the bartender light more drinks on fire... Probably a 3.5, but it gets rounded up rather than down because...review 50! Woo! Haha."}
{"text":"I went to an event here last night, never heard of House of Moments before and was pleasantly surprised.  The space is gorgeous and has a very creative vibe.   Layout is a bit odd, but for a special venue there was plenty of space to move around, comfortable couches and artwork showcased on the walls.   The food at the event (sushi) was equally tasty but nothing out of this world.  I enjoyed the actual place more than anything else."}
{"text":"My wife and I only went here because she got a $100 gift certificate from work.  The decor seems to be all over the place, is it a warehouse? is it an asian restaurant? an art gallery? I found this whole place to be disjointed. The art hangs in the back in an area that feels unfinished (I tripped on a cable on the way to the bathroom). The asian themed decor clashes with the white cement pillars all over the place, feels like they just robbed a Chinese museum and are holding the artifacts here while you eat.   The server was great, very attentive, no complaints there.  We ordered the lobster tempura and were both quite disappointed with it. It was very bland and overcooked. I kept dipping it into the sauce to get some sort of taste because it has zero taste and was quite rubbery. I won't lie, the sushi was fantastic.  Overall - if you got $150 to spend for dinner for two, go somewhere else. The premium they charge for the venue just isn't worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"You know how there's some good restaurants on the east side but not really a good hangout place? Maybe couple of bars/lounges but its no destination unless you live in the area? Well now you have THE destination. Seriously this place is all that's lacking on the east side, it's not only a restaurant but a bar, and a lounge and also an art gallery and I heard from the owner how he's thinking about building a swimming pool on the roof top. Take THAT west-siders. this is why we are SOOO cool.   The food is simply AMAZING. I can say I had one of the best sushi in my whole life there.   The decor is so beautiful yet very different and exotic. Makes a romantic place for an intimate date. It's also a perfect spot for a large group of people, for a birthday perhaps, to start with dinner and have more friends join you later.  I guess you can tell how much I love this place right? And that I live on the east side?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Its hard to find places that are truly unique these days and this place its decor and theme is truly a one of a kind moment.  It has a new york chic ambience.  Live music art gallery what more could you ask for.  Its a gem kind of hidden in the city and well the food, sushi? Not too shabby and good quality."}
{"text":"The decor is a bit out of place, The food is mainly Japanese, but they use chinese, thai etc decor or other asian influences... anyways it's random pieces in a warehouse.  The rolling chairs is a bit annoying.  The food was not very good, especially the sushi, there's lots of heavy sauces, the rolls are too big each piece. overpriced sushi.  they did not have UNI in stock.  the portions are small.  The waitress scammed us. My friend left early (we had a group of 9 girls) she thought it would be confusing so she gave $60 to the waitress to cover her portion. (that's what the waitress told her)  when our bill came (The waitress thought she was smart and split the bill up for us) for one my bill was incorrect TWICE, there was drinks on it that did not exist etc. and in the system she was able to mess around with the TAX amounts, my friend who  had the exact same bill as me, however my TOTAL was more, cause she was able to put in WHATEVER tax amount in there. The funny thing is, she is able to go back and change the receipt however she wanted  anyways a friend and I both asked her separately in 2 occasions if she deducted our friend's $60 before she split it up and gave us all out separate bills and she said she did. so we trusted her , since it's her job and she probably does this everyday (WRONG)   Only did I realize that she had scammed us and pocketed our friends money, after I looked carefully at the bills and calculated it. (I'm in accounting)  so she took the mandatory 18% tips + our friends extra $60 as tips. So she made about $200 on our table alone, and she probably scams unsuspecting customers all the time with this (splinting bills system they have) it splits all the dishes in 8 (for example if the sushi plate was $14 and you have 8ppl, it will show as $1.75 on the receipt and a 1/8 on the side instead of 1)  Sorry but I will never come back here again, if the service was exceptionally good, i would not mind giving her a $60 extra on top of the 18% tips (it's 18% on top the food + tax, yes another 18% on top of the 13% tax)"}
{"text":"Great venue!  Love the decor. Staff are awesome. Bathrooms are not big enough though!"}
{"text":"This is a unique place because it's not your typical restaurant.  It feels like an art gallery when you walk in, which I think is awesome.  Service was on point and the food was amazing.  Had a bunch of different dishes like the beer salad, lobster tempura, steak, sea bass and a bunch of rolls and sashimi.  My favourite dish was the roll with the enoki mushrooms and scallops.  It was like heaven in a roll.  Nice place for a date if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"The ambiance is quite unique, too bad it's quite away from central down town.  What is essentially a warehouse, House of Moments incorporates a restaurant & asian inspired contemporary art gallery.  From scuptures, and canvases, to various fixtures, and artsy decor. The down-tempo house music playing in the background makes you want to bobble your head as you eat your meal, and even get up at times to dance...if you're more of a piano musician there's a piano towards the back :) I can safely say this place is one of a kind!!  The server was helpful, knowledgeable...but unfortunately slow lol... Their drink menu has a handful selection, but does NOT compromise the quality.  The food......see the scoop below.  Edamame: 4/5 not salty at all, which is great, the sesame seeds sprinkled on top added some flavour since this appetizer is bland to begin with.  Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura: 4/5 Perfect balance of batter, unlike most places where its majority batter.  Presentation was creative, and the value was exceptional.   Spicy Sushi Dish: This trio included Spicy salmon sushi, Spicy tuna sushi, and Russian Sushi (Which I've never heard of nor had).  Though the Russian sushi had jalapeño peppers on top of each individual sushi I didn't find it as spicy as the tuna sushi, but nonetheless all three sushi's were delightful  This venue hosts weekly parties, however this particular day there was no DJ! the place is a great venue to hosts parties, etc.  Definitely a unique venue in this city that I would love to revisit. Just keep in mind this place is priced accordingly to the quality!"}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday for a private event, and while I really enjoyed the event and think highly of the group organizing the event, I was very disappointed with the venue itself for a number of reasons:  (1) Over-priced drinks.  The drinks were ridiculously priced ($15 for a single carefully-measured shot of whisky)  (2) Terrible layout.  While the art work itself is interesting, the actual layout of the space is horrendous and the pillar interferes with your ability to really gauge the space and interact with large groups.  (3) Greasy hors d'oeuvre.  Even in my drunken state, I couldn't even eat more than half of one of the many deep fried, oil-drenched appetizers that were being handed out.  Just horrendous.  Add to that one of the servers dropped something on the floor, which I happened to point out, and they rudely said they would be back to get it (which they never did, and it just lay there on the floor)  With the art work (which actually started to feel redundant and all sort-of blended together), this venue had the potential to be something great, but my overall assessment is a major thumbs down."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. But kind of just the place ... And food. To be frank, the servers were a little bit pushy. Minus a little bit.   The ambience like many reviewers before have said, is amazing. It's one of a kind. It's like dining in a really hip art gallery with Buddha statues at every corner. The dining area is really spread out, and the tables are a bit larger for my liking as it's quite far from your partner but otherwise I absolutely love the restaurant.   This review is based on a prix fixe menu as well so some of the items I'm listing MIGHT be restricted to that menu.  Curry Sashimi: LOL WUT. It's one of the weirdest combinations I've ever had for food .. But it's surprisingly really good! The spiciness and flavors of the curry contrasts the simple, clean taste of the tuna an salmon sashimi  Signature Sushi Set: It featured two different sushis. One was the RUSSIAN ROLL (8pcs) Avocado, Banana Long Peppers, Spicy Salmon & Fresh Jalapeno on Top. Never tasted anything like it before but it was delicioussssss. Especially if you like spicy, this definetly had a kick to it. The other one I had was RED VELVET ROLL (8pcs) Deep Fried Shrimp, Avocado, Cucumber, Fish Egg, Tomato, Tuna Chunk, Garlic Mayo, Green Onion. This one was my favourite. I loved the hefty Asian flavors in this roll, and it kind of tasted like a spring roll inside sushi. It was just so savoury, and I can never get enough of savoury.    Spicy Salmon: so before I came, yelp seemed to tell me that the spicy salmon was  the dish of the place. It's okay. It's better quality than other sushi restaurant but again, it's much more expensive. Meh. I would rather much prefer the red velvet roll.   Matcha brûlée and chocolate brownie. Both are really good, but something you can definitely get somewhere else. Didn't much stand out, but it was still quite good.   Overall, the food is quite amazing. It's a fusion I've never tried at any other place before. The atmosphere is beautiful as well (I don't get the thousand dollar doors though...) but it's beautiful. A place to impress. But the reason for the two stars was the service. I would recommend their servers to not be so pushy and try to scam their customers. For instance, I remember only ordering only one dessert, and when two came out and we told them they made a mistake they basically said they still had to charge us for it because it's already made. Whatever though, didn't want to ruin the mood.  Great food and place, not so great service though."}
{"text":"We went for dinner (4 some) and ordered the tasting menu.  The venue is unique and oddly welcoming and non-pretentious.  The menu is dominated by Japanese influece with a few twists - I wouldn't excactly call it fusion - but there are some influences.    The oyster starter was underwhelming and over-priced for the impact it left.  The tasting menu started with a beat (3 way) salad - nothing really unique - fairly predictable flavors - nice miso/sesame dressing.  The soup was very simple and underwhelming - lacked sophistication and depth of flavor (essentially a shitake wood mushroom broth).  The sushi/sashimi plate was beautiful looking, it came with some random oils on the side (the server didn't seem to know what they were and they were not substantial enough to really identify).  The plate was tasty, not the best quality salmon - the tuna was great.  Again, nothing really unique other than the presentation.  The main was a long plate with plain rice in the middle (really?) and not interesting or tasty. To one end a black cod with a beat sauce (beats again?) which was truly lovely!  Incredible in fact.  The beef on hte other end (came rare which is odd) underwhelming - not enough seasoning - the sauce tasted pretty much like a teriyaki with some roast veg.  The plate didn't flow at all - but the cod - delicious!  There was a palatte cleanser - citrus and avocado drink - it was too big and although refreshing a little odd to be honest - the meal just didn't flow and in the end I think it was a little overpriced.   I would try the restaurant again, ordering off the menu.  Some of the rolls I saw go by looked pretty tempting.  I HOPE this place does well - just love the vibe.  The staff is very friendly - but perhaps a little restraint would be good (both the manager and the self proclaimed 'founder') came and introduced themselves to us - nice...ish - not quite sure about it yet.  Try it for sure - would recommend you order off the menu and enjoy the art and vibe."}
{"text":"The sushi at House of Moments is top notch, and the ambience is unique. However, I would only give the place three stars due to the inexcusable quality of service. My colleague and I came here on a business trip to Toronto. We made reservations and arrived on time.   First of all, no one greeted us when we walked in, so we meandered over to the bar. The bartender was great and made a fantastic drink while we waited (even though there were several open tables...?). We waited for about 15-20 minutes, but I am not sure why, as the place was not crowded. When we were finally seated, no one would come to our table to give us menus, fill up our water, etc. I made eye contact with a waitress several times, but she walked right past. Keep in mind, the entire restaurant probably has a total of ten tables, and there were about three waiters and a manager walking around. There was no reason for them to overlook us. I finally went over to the manager to complain, after which things finally got better. However, at this point it was about 35-40 minutes after our reservation time, and we were STARVING.  Like I said though, the food was delicious, and if you are there for drinks, I would definitely recommend a raspberry sour. Don't expect great, or even good service, though."}
{"text":"I was conflicted in writing this review. So conflicted that I waited close to a month after celebrating my birthday here before writing this up.   Based on food and atmosphere alone, I would've given it a solid 4-5 stars and not hesitate for a second to spread the hype around this Asian-fusion restaurant. However, there were far too many hiccups in service for me to substantiate anything higher than 3 stars.  Pros - they accommodated my growing group of friends to our dinner table* - the food was really, really impressive both in presentation and flavour - awesome artwork and unique ambience  Cons - *but this was a result of the table being ready an hour late and some of my friends were only planning to attend post-dinner drinks - was sent a prix fixe menu in my reservation email exchange with the manager then told upon seating that the chef did not want to honour any fixed menus - TWICE the busser cleared our dish of uni.. with uni still on the dish (the first time we told the manager and she sent out a second dish only for a similar thing to happen again) - the salmon entree did not match the description on the menu - was overcharged for bottle service on two separate bills   Admittedly most of the cons were rectified when brought to the attention of the manager save for the prix fixe menu and salmon. However, I feel like a restaurant of this calibre (read: price point) should hold some integrity in service and not have its patrons constantly chase down managers/servers when things goes wrong."}
{"text":"Located in an old warehouse on Carlaw Avenue, House of Moments is a lounge, restaurant, bar venue. We had been there before when it was a warehouse for Kudu and a lot of the decor was left over from then. The hostess/owner? showed us around describing how the space could be utilized and the possibilities for use. You enter off of Carlaw and walk down a couple of steps into a large warehouse space. The floors are polished concrete, while the ceilings and pillars are all painted a stark white. The walls in contrast were painted black as backdrops for a collection of oversized paintings and art. The spaces were separated by diaphonus white curtains that could be drawn to define areas and large heavily carved Southeast Asian doors. There were a couple of bars, a dance area, eating areas, lounge areas and a selection of seating. The place was overwhelming and was designed to appeal to an evening crowd. The menus featured Japanese inspired sushi, tempura and bar type food, priced in a manner expected from such a nightclubby place. While not a big menu everything featured special sauces or plating that paid attention to style over substance. The place was buzzing with staff, including waitress dressed all in black save for bright red corsets. These outfits were finished with flat shoes that sadly while comfortable for serving did not match the overall style that the place tried to impart. They really needed to be in sharp stilettos to complete the sillhouette. The service was polite, with a sense of humour and prompt and efficient, and the food arrived beautifully plated. Unsurprisingly, while the food was beautiful it was not that exciting. It was standard Japanese fare that had been sadly dressed up with too much sweetener. It was an interesting experience to try something new and would appeal to a crowd that is interested in atmosphere, imbibing and socializing rather than eating."}
