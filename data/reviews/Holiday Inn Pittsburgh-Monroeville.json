{"text":"Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und sollte renoviert werden. Viel zu laute Elektro-Heizung."}
{"text":"Booked this hotel for 2 weekend nights. Used a travel website surprise hotel feature and it's a lot cheaper than downtown hotels and isn't too difficult to get to the city. It's good (3 stars), nothing to write home about. Seems as if the rooms were recently renovated. The hallways still have a feeling of oldness. Definitely fits my needs for a bed, tv,and FREE WIFI.   Free wifi deserves another star (4 stars)."}
{"text":"The summary: decent decor, love the balcony, pool is nice, customer service SUCKS and food in the restaurant tasted like a $20 TV dinner. I stayed here for a work function and went to dinner at the restaurant because it was convenient. My expectations weren't high in the first place, but this was terrible. We ate in the bar area and found our server sitting, watching TV at the bar when we walked in. She called over to us to take a seat. We had to get back up to ask for drink menus. She never came back for our order so we went up to the bar to order. That pattern continued all night. She only came to our table to drop off our food. We never got waters, we had to wait while our food sat in front of us to get silverware. I ordered the chicken Marsala. The chicken was a rubbery, processed chicken nugget tasting thing, drenched in a sweet syrupy mess. The only decent part was the baked potato (with butter and salt, hard to mess that up). I wanted vegetables but all they had were peas.  Then the hotel service. When we checked in we had packages waiting. We asked the manager to take us to where they were held in the sales office, but she urged us to check in and drop our luggage in our room and come right back for our boxes. When we did so she wasn't in the lobby anymore. We had to wait in line for the other receptionist, who when we finally got to her, didn't know where the sales office was. She radioed the manager three times with no response. Meanwhile her iPhone that was sitting on the counter kept ringing. Finally she gets ahold of the janitor who comes and takes us to the office. Surprise surprise, he opens the door and inside is the manager, looking quite startled with her radio sitting right on the desk. She didn't acknowledge that it was us. She hardly even looked at us! It was so awkward. I felt like I'd caught her in the act of something shady or something. She wouldnt look us in the eye, just pointed toward our boxes and we were on our way."}
{"text":"No hot water this was at check in. The next morning at 6 am I went to the front desk and asked when was the hot water going to be on. The gal at the front desk said 45 mins . She said they were installing a pipe right now. So fine. I waited until 830, still no hot water. The story got changed to \" the part has not arrived yet it should be an hour\" . I asked to speak to the general mgr. he said he would give me a discount of 20 % and a free breakfast. This did not help me as I had to go to a meeting, when I told him I booked thru A discounted travel website.. He said nope I can't do anything for you, he was very rude. I will never do business with them again. When I went to check out at 10, other people were complaining, and they said it could be all day with no hot water. Why did this lady lie to me at 6 am I waisted so much time and missed both meetings. The purpose of my trip was ruined."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'd be able to give this Holiday Inn property a better review if we hadn't just been coming off an amazing stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Gretna, NE during our cross-country relocation. Unfortunately, it just didn't rate above 2 stars.  First the pros: the hotel is conveniently located close to the PA turnpike, and is in an area that offers plentiful services (food, gas, shopping, etc). The bed was well-made and comfortable, and there was a small micro-fridge combo included in the room.  The cons: The property is older, and the attempts at \"renovation\" look half-hearted. The wallpaper and paint look slapped on walls, bathrooms are \"updated\" with tiles in the shower but have the same tired toilets, floors, counters, fixtures, and the carpet and furniture are \"eh\" at best. Also, the heater thermostat was off and the room was either a sauna or chilly (for some reason the settings in between just didn't seem to be working). The service was non-existent; although there were 2 people working the desk, only one seemed to be helping guests, and so we waited over 10 minutes to check in (and this was well after the normal check-in time). The customer service rep who helped us wasn't terribly friendly, didn't welcome us as Priority members, and generally seemed too busy to be bothered. It was a total 180 from the outstanding service we had received just a few days before at the Holiday Inn Express. There was no breakfast included, nor were the prices at the hotel restaurant reasonable enough to tempt us to try it.   Bottom line: it's ok, but you can probably find a better deal with better service if you look at reviews of other hotels in the area."}
{"text":"Found this little place on Bring Fido as they are dog-friendly with a pet fee of $15 per dog per night.  Clean room, no dog smell and no strong cleaning smell in room.  Keurig coffee pot in the room very nice! plus small refrigerator and spacious room with 2 double beds.  Very welcoming staff, especially Catering Manager, Beth.  Stores and restaurants all very close by (and great grassy area in back for the dogs!) We will be back!"}
{"text":"Newly remodeled room was awesome.   Clean, comfortable, and quiet.   Onsite restaurant was so so.....the burger was  way over done and the onions in the French onion soup were under done.   The hotel is 5 stars but the onsite restaurant is just 2."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow.    First off, if you're thinking of paying more for a \"jacuzzi\" room, DO NOT DO IT.  The only jacuzzi rooms in the whole hotel are RIGHT NEXT TO ELEVATORS.  They don't tell you that ahead of time and it certainly isn't on the website.  Secondly, they also don't tell you that the jacuzzi is NOT in-room.  It's IN THE BATHROOM.  There is a HUGE DIFFERENCE between a jacuzzi in the room and one in the bathroom.  If the jacuzzi is in the bathroom, then a person can't go to the bathroom and get back in the jacuzzi.  If you want privacy, you have to kick everyone out of the jacuzzi, have them wait in the cold room and then re-enter the jacuzzi room that now smells like bowel movement.  If I had known that the jacuzzi wasn't separate from the bath tub, I would never have booked the room.    I entered the room and there were flies flying around.  GROSS.  Also, the room is one of those cheaply constructed rooms where the only heater/air conditioner is a stand alone thing on the ground that is running and making loud noise.  It doesn't shut off when it gets to a certain temperature, so it is ALWAYS ON and ALWAYS LOUD and you either freeze or burn up.  There is no middle ground.  Finally, this hotel is located at the intersection of like 3 freeways.  So, between the noise from the elevator, the noise from the heater and the noise from the freeways, YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING ANY SLEEP.  Stay away from this horrible hotel."}
{"text":"The restaurant staff was great. Friendly and thoughtful with great customer service.  That being said, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. We had called the local number in advance to ask for specific accommodations for my multiple chemical sensitivities.  The front desk , without telling us, forwarded the call on to the national reservation desk where we asked for fabric softener free sheets and towels. The reservationist said, yes, we can do this, but there's no guarantee!\" The reservation was taken. Then when we arrived, there was no record of the accommodation request. We+ asked the manager to check with housekeeping to see if the could accommodate my needs despite the fact that they had no record in advance. When he contacted housekeeping, their response was they wouldn't say one way or the other whether they used fabric softeners or even if they could change out the sheets.!  This lack of accommodation, especially with the mushy responses, is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act!"}
{"text":"We normally book two rooms here every September for an annual show. At over 2 miles away, it's not convenient to the convention center, but as a Priority Club member, I've gotten okay service here in the past and feel a certain loyalty to this hotel. However, with our last stay, everything went to Hell in a handbasket.  First off, we were kept waiting at the Check-In desk much longer than necessary. There were three employees working, but only one helping a guest in front of us. Second, I wasn't addressed as a Priority Club member and didn't receive my normal perks when checking in: free cocktail and $10 off breakfast or 1,000 bonus points to my PC account. Third, we were told that a rollaway would cost an outrageous extra $15 PER NIGHT. I've never been to a hotel that charges for a rollaway - that's utterly ridiculous. Then, even if we would've paid the charge for a rollaway, there was no way that it would've fit in between the second bed and the wall. The bathroom needed to be remodeled and it was extremely crowded in there, between the door, the vanity and the tiny space between the commode and shower. The \"free\" Wi-Fi was slower than Christmas and their \"tech\" team would never answer the phone.  Surprise, surprise... we checked out after just one night. However, the front desk staff acted like it was no big deal that we were unhappy and didn't provide a receipt. We were lucky and found another hotel at the same price that was 10 times better AND included free breakfast. But, when we returned home, our credit card statement listed full charges for two rooms and a duration of five days (Sept. 28-Oct. 2).  It's been almost three months and we've not heard one word from Holiday Inn Monroeville. The front desk staff continues to tell us that \"Accounting\" will call us back. We've contacted corporate to no avail, so we've had to file with our credit card company to have the charges refunded. Obviously, we won't be staying here again... and with the level of service we've received from corporate, I'm afraid to book another Holiday Inn ever again."}
{"text":"My husband and I (along with our dog, Porter) were stranded on the side of the PA highway on a freezing winter night. After our rescue, our super tow truck driver, Matt, recommended this Holiday Inn as an affordable and nice place to stay. At the time, we had no way of knowing how right he was. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with such kindness. We were checked in promptly and our room was clean and spacious- just the retreat we needed after our ordeal. (I will add that after reading others' reviews,  that it is clear the hotel has been recently renovated/updates and offers sleek, modern and cozy decor.) We had the pleasure of interacting with a number of staff members throughout our stay and each did or said something kind and generous. Without us asking for any special accommodations, we were offered complimentary snacks and drinks, a late check out fee was waived when we had to extend our stay while looking for a new car, and Porter was happily greeted and pet to his heart's content. Upon checking out and hearing of our troubles, a kind manager offered us a discount in the restaurant. The service and food were wonderful and we were so grateful for the gesture. We had a rough start to 2018 but it's definitely looking up. We will forever remember the kindnesses were were shown by so many folks here in Monroeville, especially those shown by the staff here at Holiday Inn. THANK YOU."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a wedding reception in late May.   Check in was smooth and the service from the hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The AC in the room worked well and had the room nice and chilly.  Overall the room aspect of the hotel was exactly what you would expect from a Holiday Inn.  The price seemed a little steep for a Holiday Inn in Monroeville but I didn't compare prices to the other local hotels to see what the going rate for rooms in the area is.   The reception aspect of the hotel had a few more problems.  The facility was good for a wedding reception of about 100 people and allowed for enough tables and room to dance.  The food provided by the hotel was buffet style and pretty standard for wedding reception cuisine.  The biggest issue was the air conditioning in the room was not working well.  The room heated up quick and people had to leave to go to their rooms or lobby to get some relief.  We were informed that this was a fairly common issue in the room."}
{"text":"We stayed here on whim not wanting to drive back to ohio late at night.  So glad we did.  Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfy beds and the best free breakfast I've ever had.  Thanks HI :)"}
{"text":"2 day stay, traveled from Missouri, we walked into our room and carpet was sticky. Had reservations for breakfast- 1st day took 2.5 hours to be served burnt waffles, burnt eggs that weren't edible (took pics) took another 1/2 to bring out new meals which were wrong. Wait staff complained entire time. We walked out. One broken elevator and the other malfunctioned while on it twice. Tv would not work 2nd day (prepaid meals) again breakfast disaster, I had to set table, retrieved our own drinks, restaurant now empty and still no food. Front desk is no help. Will be contacting the GM."}
{"text":"If you're on a budget, it'll suffice, but it's old. If you take 5 seconds & look close at anything, you'll see it's beat. I'd stay elsewhere next time. Residence Inn down by Buffalo Wild Wings looked new-ish."}
{"text":"It's like this place used to be a YMCA or something. They're trying to de-scuzz the place but you can only dress up a turd so much.   We were passing through and tried every other hotel in the area but they were all booked.  This place had plenty of rooms available though.  Wonder why?  Ick.   The elevator smells like sour milk.   $140 a night for this is just silly."}
{"text":"It's a holiday inn and you get what you pay for. Clean nice room, no frills but comfy beds, HBO, free wifi. They did have three restaurants either in or near by the hotel and the room service is always nice. Restaurants nearby deliver too! Oh and remember it's at the top of a hill so if your driving a uhaul in the middle of winter it's not the easiest to get up."}
{"text":"This hotel turned out to be a small disappointment. There building is very old and needs a lot of TLC! Flooring, carpet, lighting fixtures, and paint are very run down. There was also a slight smell in some of the hallways.  If your used to some of the full breakfasts the comparisons hotels offer, that will also fall short! On the upside, the staff more then made up for that. All were friendly and helpful. I would not stay here in the future."}
{"text":"Stayed here on free IHG rewards points. The hotel was being remodeled so it was kind of a mess. The entrance was a makeshift desk setup through a side entrance. Staff was very friendly and give us two free breakfast vouchers for the remodeling trouble. The room was clean and comfy. Breakfast was actually pretty decent. The hotel is located just off 22 in Monroeville...excellent location for shopping and a short drive to the mall (which has went down in quality as of late yikes!). Also located next to Max and Erma's which is actually a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Recently stayed here for 6 nights in a business trip to the area. Overall, it is what I expect when I stay at a Holiday Inn Hotel. Friendly staff, clean room, comfortable bed, decent wifi... No free continental breakfast here.... But, they have a bar/restaurant in the lobby area for dinner. The guest laundry is only 1 washer & 1 dryer, so the wait can be ling if others are using. The area is nice, close to the new hospital, Miracle Mile shopping area & Penn Center. Over all I had a great stay stay and recommend."}
{"text":"I stayed at this location during a visit for my Class reunion. I usually stay at other locations but since I was only going to stay for 2 days I decided that this was a good deal. Pretty basic setup other than the refrigerator and microwave. The rooms were clean. There was also a nice bar and restaurant at the hotel. A good location to stay for a quick visit."}
{"text":"Didn't really like this hotel. Gave us a smoking room when we specifically asked for non smoking. Reception was not friendly. Flush for toilet didn't work. Plus sides were beds and wifi. Would not stay here again."}
{"text":"We stayed here for an event that was taking place at the convention center near by that my husband was attending. Even though we really only live an hour away, I took this as a mini vacation. We heard that the hotel is under new management which is a good sign considering the reviews we read before booking. It looks like there is construction going on and they're redoing a lot of the hotel - which is good because it does need a makeover! Anyway, I had a great time here with our baby. The outdoor pool was a perfect temperature and was also really clean and the restaurant food was good too. Our waitress was really nice and gave us some suggestions on vegetarian options. Try the flatbread - its delish.   For the price we will def stay here again and also for the service. There was no waiting in line and I'm really excited to see the hotel after the construction is done. Hopefully the convention next year will be in the same spot so we can go back!"}
{"text":"After traveling from Chicago driving all day we decided to stop here for the night. Front desk was very courteous and quick because we were very tired and about to sleep right there. I got a sudden burst of energy and carried my gf to the room. Our room was great is all I can say with a comfortable bed, working a/c, bathroom, and everything was perfect. Great location too by the highway with easy access to shops, dining, gas stations, 24 hour kinkos, and Hindu temple nearby."}
{"text":"I made this hotel reservation on hotwire.com so I wasn't sure the hotel brand I was going to get, but this hotel was a luck hit.  I'll start with the room:  1. I was assigned a room with a king bed and non smoking.  The bedding was comfortable, clean, and attractive. 2. The room had a small refridgerator and microwave at no additional charge. This was very convenient because I had a smaller cooler of food I needed to keep cold over night. 3. There was an exceptionally comfortable lounge chair and footstool in the corner that was perfect for some light morning reading and cup of coffee. 4. A well laid out desk was provided if a guest needed to work out of their hotel room. 5. A TON OF ELECTRICAL OUTLETS- anywhere I moved in the room there was an electrical outlet avaliable to plug my laptop into.  The whole hotel, including my room, was very clean.  I always notice when hotel rooms, hallways, or lobbies have a funny smell or don't seem to have been maintained properly, but this hotel was excellent.  There was a nice cardio room on the main floor of the hotel and a decent looking restaurant off the lobby.  Free wireless is avaliable for all guests.  As for the location of the hotel I found it very convenient. Located just of the turnpike and 20 min from downtown Pittsburgh on the highway I was able to do everything I needed with ease during my stay.  If I ever need to stay in Pittsburgh again I would love to book a room in this Holiday Inn.  This hotel was a great value and had excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was knocked out by how pleasant and helpful the staff was here. Made this a very comfortable place to stay. Good bar and restaurant in lobby for a budget hotel. Free wifi. I would stay here again."}
{"text":"The bar/restaurant food is garbage.  Greasy Philly cheesesteak should be called \"cheesesinew\" because of the sinew and toughness in the small portion of meat.  6 potato chips.  Garbage.  You'll love the rooms if you like tiny bathrooms, old-style garbage wall HVAC units where you cannot set the temperature, fancy 26\" TVs and a 1969 elevator that seems to be full twice this night I used it and had to wait.  The Clowne Plaza is a much better Priority Club property.  The Holiday Inn at the airport is dynamite, I will switch to there."}
{"text":"I used some points for our overnight stay returning to Michigan from out east.  The location off the Interstate was very convenient.  The lobby has a clean, modern look and checking in was fast and easy (thanks, Shelby).  Staff are polite and pleasant to deal with.  The room was neat and clean with a small refrigerator and microwave.  Free WiFi and simple complimentary breakfast with additional-charge options available.  I would definitely stay here again if I'm passing through this area."}
{"text":"I gave this 1star only bc I have to.  This hotel has been beyond our worst experience.  We were here for a baseball tournament and there were several teams here from the same organization.  This hotel failed to service the rooms properly or couldn't even do all the rooms in a timely manner and only handed out towels if needed.  We have sweaty boys using the beds and did not even make the beds let alone change the sheets.  The toilet seats don't fit the toilets and the maintenance man has to be called every time the toilet is flushed.  The room smells of MOLD and the carpet in the rooms are damp.  The fitness center has a cigarette odor as well as the machine are wobbly when being used.  We are locked in to staying another night bc of the tournament or we would have checked out by now.  Only nice thing to say about this hotel is Crystal the waitress is very very nice and brings you anything you need."}
{"text":"Welcome staff is friendly and smiling. The hotel itself is clean but looks dated.  Conference rooms on our floor were deserted but still had leftover items(coffee, plates etc) in them. Nothing earth shattering, just noticeable. Room is quiet and met our needs for a quiet first night in Pittsburgh.  Free wifi is an absolute dismal failure. Couldn't keep it logged on to save my life. That is frustrating and should be addressed. That type of thing is a deal breaker for me.  Also, had the need to buy from their snack area. After finishing our 9.50 snack(see pic) we noted that the chips were expired. Upon checkout we told the front desk chick that she might want to check the dates on the remaining snacks. She said thanks and continued with her day. Really?  9.50 and thats it. No \"i am  sorry\". Why dont you grab another for your inconvenience?  Nope. Just...dont let the door hit you on the way out. Incidentally, we went right next door to Hampton Inn. Much better digs.   For me, it is doubtful I would stay here again. For the money, it is no great value. No complimentary anything. No bottle of water.  No breakfast. No wifi. No thank you."}
{"text":"The stay was fine. What annoyed me is that I get home from my trip and I can't find something that I had left on the bed that is very sentimental to me. I called late last night in which they told me to call housekeeping the following morning. Took me three hours to get ahold of housekeeping the next day and they kept telling me they didn't find it. Clearly it was on the bed and it didn't walk away on it's own. Poor house keeping service! Inconsiderate of personal possessions."}
