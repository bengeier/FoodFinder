{"text":"Great food! The ingredients were so fresh and the pizza was so perfectly cooked.  I really loved the flavor and totally recommend coming here if you are ever in the area.  Also the service was great as the owner put on the baseball game for us so we got to eat great food and watch the game."}
{"text":"I had the Mediterranean. One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. Very flavourful, and perfectly cooked. The place is brand new, and the staff are very nice. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just went yesterday and got the pepperoni. It was really good and it had lots of peps which are of good quality.  And I mean lots.   The topping selection is huge, with a lot high quality ingredients that you definitely will not see at the box stores.  My small pepperoni was under ten bucks and the more specialty pizzas do definitely go up in price but    I'm sure worth it...c'mon it's prosciutto.         This is not a slice store which I'd never order cause you need fresh. This is mostly take out with small dine in.                        If your in Bronte and want a good take out pizza and not cheap ass Pizza pizza or dirt dog Dominos then this is were I'm going from now on!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Great crust, delicious sauce and always perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Superb pizza, definitely gives you your money's worth, very clean and friendly place. Would for sure recommend if you are in town for business and just want to grab a quick bite after work. A great selection of wings that I wish to try next time."}
{"text":"Best pizza in GTA, great variety of pizza, descent price. Very tasty and high quality material used, great service"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered a Hawaiian and we were amazed. The sauce was great, the crust was PERFECT. Not too thick, not too thin, perfect amount of crunch. Really happy with how everything tasted. There were 3 gentleman working when we picked it up. 2 older and one a bit younger. They were super polite and nice. Overall great experience and the drive from Burlington was also fun. Nice drive with the windows down along lakeshore. I already recommended this place to some friends and we would definitely go back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Only take out place i know that makes there own dough and has fresh toppings. During the day you can see them chopping up fresh veggies and can see bags of flour in the kitchen. Fresh dough is quite noticeable - light, airy and not so salty."}
{"text":"Best take out pizza I've ever had. The dough is homemade and tastes gourmet. The toppings are always fresh and they have a variety of pizzas on their menu. It sure beats getting a slice at a chain pizza place. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was driving home to Mississauga from my parents and decided to take lakeshore  and stumble upon this pizza shop. Their sign caught my attention. Ever since that day every time I crave pizza I'd drive all the way down just for box of it. I'm a simple guy My favourite is just pepperoni and Mushroom and still you can def taste the quality"}
{"text":"All I can say is that GREAT PIZZA & WINGS! My son and I loved it. The toppings are fresh and the sauce is something that you've never tasted from other pizzerias. The sauce is what makes a great pizza and fresh toppings and Pizza Pienza is the place! If you want great pizza & wings come to Pizza Pienza you won't be disappointed  and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Not good, gave me heartburn and indigestion, and got a weird vibe when I walked in. Haven't been back."}
{"text":"Likely one of the best pizzas that we've had in a long time.   Amazing crust,  fresh ingredients,  and gooey cheese all cooked to perfection.   Both the kids and adults LOVED it!"}
{"text":"So WOW!!! I was in the Bronte area starving and decided to order through skip the dishes , after reading the reviews i thought why not suck it up until i'm finished and walk in to get the full experience. I don't regret anything. first off the customer service is stellar. The way they great you and he even asked my name and addressed me as such which is really nice.Asked if it was my first time and helped me making a decision as there are so many options/toppings, that you'd never get at regular pizza joints. They also sell sandwiches, calzones, salads, and wings.  This is definitely closer to the top of my list when it comes to pizza joints. The sauce is definitely quality made with fresh ingredients and you can definitely tell  I had the pesto Margarita pizza medium(8 slices) I loved it , not only did it have mozzarella and parmigiana cheese. It also had real bocconcini cheese.  Where do they do that?  The pesto and fresh basil gave it a real fresh flavor, that you definitely don't experience with the chain pizza joints.  The one and only thing I found was the actual crust/dough was sort of bland. Maybe just needed a pinch of salt even. I mean I guess some people may prefer it his way as no added oils and such but I wish it had a bit more taste.  The wings are pretty good as well, cooked to perfection w great amount of sauce. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Pienza is the only place we get our pizza now. It's fresh, the selection of toppings is great and if you like Caesar salad with your pizza, they've got the freshest in town. The biggest reason we order from here?  The staff are great but most of all, the pizza is the most authentic we've tasted here! Five stars from our household."}
