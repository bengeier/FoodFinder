{"text":"Yusef is a cool authentic Middle Eastern food place.

Mr K was right on his warning of wait time for the food, fortunately, ours came out in less than 20 minutes.  Time passes pretty quick in here browsing through the extensive selection of Middle Eastern spices, cheeses, halvas and other specialty foods.  

Solid rendition of gyros and falafel...but the sublime baklava is what will be drawing me back to Yusef...just the right amount of sweetness and a light touch with the rose water.

Tasty and cheap alternative for lunch with sandwiches going for just $4.99 and 2 pieces of buttery baklava for just $1.75

If you're thinking of grabbing a bite for dinner, beware that they close fairly early at 7pm."}
{"text":"Just had another delicious lunch at Yusef's.  I am lucky enough to have Yusef's as a neighbor to my catering business so when I am tired of what I am cooking, I go their for lunch.  The felafel was GREAT and they always have all of the obscure items I seem to need!  Come have lunch and buy some fun stuff for your next meal at home."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time not having known for 10 years that we were neighbors.  I'll start with the fact that the owner/operator was extremely polite greeting you when you enter and welcoming you.  I had my 2 toddlers in tow, and this can be intimidating to most small shop owners knowing one bad move can cause chaos from a toddler.  We sat down ordered some meals, lamb gyro, chicken ka-bob sandwich, hummus.  Easy mediteranean meal almost imposible to mess it up.  We walked in at opening so it took 10 minutes or so for food, but the array of goods in the market to shop made the time fly.  With no prompting they took it upon them selves to split the gyru meal for my kids, which was awesome and a super time saver for me.  The flat bread pita was good more authentic to the chew than the buttery mall version (though I like both).  The meat was perfect the lamb tender with a nice sear on it, very generous thickness as well preserving the meat texture.  their tatziki was a chunky version with great flavor and a crisp cucumber crunch through-out very refreshing in the 100+ degree lunch temps we were having.  The chicken was good with a nice subtle flavor and plenty of juice left inside the well grilled meat.  
The hummus was traditional and very smooth more dip than spread.  
Overall I am super impressed, the market has every canned and jarred good you could imagine from SPAM to stuffed Olive leaves and all stops in between.  The deli counter had a simple variety of olives and various feta cheeses, their produce was depleted (possibly because I walked in as they unlocked the doors) or not stocked yet.  I will be returning to shop and to eat again.  The welcoming owner made me feel as though my children will also be dining there regularly.  I will try to work my way through their menu board over the coming weeks, and will try to report back."}
{"text":"When ever I'm in Phoenix I eat at this place 3-4 times over a two week visit to the area. 
This place is located in a quiet strip mall with plenty of parking. The market its self has a nice verity of foods and goodies with several tables in the back to sit and enjoy a good meal. 

Today I took my two cousins with me, we got two kibbi sandwiches, falafel sandwich and a plate of humus with pita to share. I'm 6'4 and can really eat a lot and I am always amazed at how filling their sandwiches are not to mention tasty! For 25 bucks all three of us managed to leave stuffed. They have the quality, taste and price that makes this place a frequent visit on my todo list. 

Ps. Get a plate of cucumber and yogurt with pita, it's very refreshing; also there are these amazing chocolate and pistachio wafers called nutymax try one!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Yusef's for 15 years.  Among the local Middle Eastern restaurants, we have found Yusef's (Owner is named Jimmy.) to serve delicious, fresh, flavorful Middle Eastern dishes.  We look forward to seeing the owner Jimmy when we're there because we're always greeted with a smile, a handshake, and excellent service.  The restaurant is clean and well kept.  Most importantly, the food is excellent!  It is packed with flavor and freshness.  It is prepared daily, so you know you're getting it fresh on your plate each time.  You don't want to miss his delicious hummus, babaganoush, Greek salads, stuffed grape leaves, lebni, and olives.  Additionally, part of the establishment is a Middle Eastern store, so you can buy any supplies you may need from him as well. Keep up the good work, Jimmy!  Please go to Yusef's.  My husband Ribhi and I highly recommend this restaurant and store."}
{"text":"Best Babaganoush & Flat Bread in Arizona. (Must buy bread in freezer section; babaganoush in deli)"}
{"text":"Very tasty and friendly service at the market. Picked up some fresh ground Turkish coffee while there."}
{"text":"We discovered this place by accident and decided to give it a try. The owner was very nice and the food was very good and also not expensive. We ordered the chicken gyros and kebob and some fries. Everything was delicious, there could've been a few more fries though. We also bought some groceries in the store. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best hummus and baclava in town, great for take away on movie night. Freshly made tabuli is very good"}
{"text":"Yesterday morning I decided, because I'm brilliant, to hike. Not one. Not two. But three of Phoenix's seven peaks. Starting at 10 in the morning.

Granted, they were three of the smaller peaks (Shaw Butte, Lookout Mountain, and Shadow Mountain), but little did I know it was going to be Phoenix's first 100 degree day of the year (going up the southern trail of Shaw vs. taking the dirt road up was pretty friggin' exhausting, I'll tell you that much).

In any case, after scrambling down Shadow Mountain (the third of the three), I was a sight - all sweaty, scraped up, and badly burnt due to cheap sunscreen (curse you, generic Walgreen's brand) and so I looked like a dripping wet grilled tomato, but man, was I famished. Rarely, if ever, am I in the environs of Cave Creek Road and Greenway, and when driving away trying to figure out what and where I was going to eat something, I spotted Yusef's.

Immediately I pulled in and walked inside. Now, I must have been a sight because the old couple eating at the table by the door just stared at me. I surveyed the place for a bit. Pretty much a well-stocked Middle Eastern market full of Arab and Israeli goods. I read the article cut out from the Arizona Republic some time back which gives a brief background about the owner, who took over the store in the mid-80's. 

I walked up to the counter, where the owner kind of looked taken aback by the human mess standing in front of him. I could imagine what was on this guy's mind. \"Is this guy homeless? Is he tweaking on a meth? Why's he dripping wet?\" I was hoping the iPod strapped to my arm would clue him that I was actually was exercising, to which he probably thought, \"This guy's exercising outside in this heat? Freak. What's wrong with him?\"

\"Hi.\"

\"Hi.\"

\"I'd like a chicken kebab sandwich.\"

\"That would be 20 minutes. You sure you want to wait for it?\"

I was starving, but I was also dead tired and waiting while sitting in an air conditioned store/restaurant didn't seem so bad.

\"Sure, I'll wait.\"

\"You'd like this to go or for here?\"

\"Here, please. And I'll take 3 Gatorades. I climbed three peaks today, that's why I'm a little messy. Sorry.\"

\"Uh, fine. You go sit down now.\"

As I was sitting and cooling off, two guys came in speaking and joking in Arabic. They sat down, too, and looked like they knew the owner pretty well. One then tried to take the owner's picture, and the owner gave him the smackdown about lawsuits or something, even though they were very jovial with each other. But the owner was serious.

Needless to say, I didn't chance it when my sandwich came to my table, so no pics of the food. Sorry. I'd say it was tasty, though - saffron & spice marinated grilled chicken breast pieces in a nice pita with shredded lettuce, pickles, and olives. I wanted to sit and savor it slowly, but I pretty much just wolfed it down. Decent value for $4.99, I guess. 

I went over the rest of the menu, which ranged from fresh, cool Mediterranean salads to grilled lamb & beef & chicken dishes served with rice pilaf to desserts like walnut / pistachio / almond baklava to drinks such as Turkish coffee and hot anise tea. The most expensive items on the menu were three combo dishes, all $11.99. One of them is the veggie combo, which includes hummus, veggie dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), spinach pie, falafel, and mujadara (a rice/lentil dish), so definitely a place for carnivores and herbivores to break pita together.

Now, given that I only got one simple sandwich, I can only rate this place so high at the moment (I'll have to try some entrees before adding any more stars).

I'd say the store part had a pretty decent selection of goods, but there are other Middle Eastern markets in the Valley with a much more varied and greater number of stocked items. I also couldn't tell if the owner's demeanor is that way with everyone or if I freaked him out by my appearance. Who knows. Then again, if I looked like a dark red, glistening shadow, I can't imagine most places would have been friendly towards me. 

But I'm still glad my crazy lapse of judgement of hiking in insane heat brought me to this place. Because now I know it's a good joint to go to if I'm ever in this stretch of north Phoenix.

Three heatstricken stars."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken kabab in my order of small hummus that was delicious! The chicken was perfectly cooked tender and moist. I just wish I didn't pay about $9 for my lunch meal on this. If it was in the 5-6 dollar range I'd probably eat here a few times a week!"}
{"text":"Try the tabbouleh salad!  We usually get the lunch special if we make it in time.  Great value, amazing food.  Fabulous baklava as well"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out a day in advance for a lunch meeting at work. The man who took my order was very helpful and easy to work with, and our order was perfect and so delicious. We got beef, chicken and lamb kebabs, and Greek salad. My co-workers loved it!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this grocery & deli. The food is AMAZING. The service is GREAT! Wouldn't change a thing! I love going there!"}
{"text":"I'm a half-Anglo Mexican, raised on cheesy potatoes (thanks, Mom) and tamales (thanks, Nana). It amazes me that Middle-Eastern food came to be my favorite.

I dig Yusef's. The Gyros are delicious. The hummus is delicious. Everyone is nice. It's cheap. Maybe not Haji-Baba cheap, but if two can get a good lunch for under 15 bucks, that's cheap enough. I've never bought anything from the grocery, save for a chocolate-covered banana candy, but they seem to have a pretty good selection of everything you'd need to make some awesome grub.

I hope they're open today - I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for all your middle eastern dietary needs.
My husband's family is Syrian and they swear by this place's falafel, hommus and baba ghanoush (sp?). They have every middle eastern candy, canned good, kitchen accessory and obscure food item you can imagine. A fun place to browse. Don't let the exterior and the strip mall location fool you, it is very cleanly and well-kept inside. You can even order some lentil soup and eat it in a booth by the window."}
{"text":"Delightful.  My falafel sandwich ($4.35!) was made with care. It arrived at my table nex to the window in the clean and orderly grocery store very hot, with a generous portion of tomato, just the right amount of onion and tahini sauce that had a bit too much \"tahini-tang\" for my taste.  The falafel itself was, again, nice and hot, but lacked an crispness to its outer layer.  The flavor of the falafel lacked salt but tasted very fresh and wholesome.  

On my way out I purchased a couple cans of baba-ganouj and dolmas at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Had the combo plate. The chicken and lamb was amazing, the ground beef was seasoned too heavily with something, but still good. Rica and pita was great, Greek salad was great as well."}
{"text":"Just went in for the first time and ordered chicken kabobs with no pita and explained I was allergic to wheat/gluten which he seemed to understand. Dropped $20 on that plus hummus, only to get home and find vermicelli in the rice, while I was chewing the first bite. I spit it out and really hope I don't get sick :( 

It adds literally nothing to the dish, it adds no additional texture or flavour, and it's not listed on the menu. He asked me if I was ok with rice, which of course I said yes. The salad was also not very good at all, it's just a pile of iceberg lettuce with some feta, one slice of green pepper, one slice of red onion, one olive. Even without the allergy issue, it was overpriced. I phoned him right away and explained I couldn't eat this meal because of the noodles they added to the rice (why!?) and he only offered to make something else, no refund. I urged him to remove it from the dish or at least add it to the menu so folks know. 

I would have been better off setting fire to a $20 bill, at least it wouldn't make me sick."}
{"text":"I was looking for a market that specialized in middle eastern foods and this was close to my home. The store is spotless!, the shelves are very organized and carry a wide variety of foods that are typical to the middle east. I purchased some of their homemade hummus to go. It came with some pita bread and smelled so good I had to taste it as soon as I got home. It was very good and definitely better than Sabra!. The owner/person behind the counter couldn't have been nicer. They had some black tea in bulk by the cash register and I asked about it. Earl Grey, and Earl Grey with Bergamot. It smelled incredible! I bought some to try and was not disappointed. They had a small refrigerated case with some  other cheeses. I also got some baklava which was wonderful! 

If you are looking for a good selection of speciality foods from the middle east, you will most likely find it here. The only thing I didn't find was fresh baked pita bread, but they do carry pita bread. They also have an area where you can eat food purchased here. Very clean and well run. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yusef's has to be the largest and cleanest, most organized Middle Eastern markets that I have been to in PHX. Stopped by here over the weekend and was really impressed by the selection and size of the groceries. If you're looking for anything Middle Eastern, you'll find it here. Their hummus is heavy on tahini; the baba ganoush is very good. Haven't sampled their food, but after my overall experience, the Vegetarian Combo is calling my name. Only downside is that they sell premade pitas, which are very generic."}
{"text":"Used to be great, now there's a new owner. He smokes inside the store. Menu the same, but the portions are smaller. Sad, I won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go, along with their fresh feta, pitas and cucumber yogurt. BEST I'VE HAD! Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG, it was delis and the prices are fabulous. I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow, it was UNREAL! I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice (basmati?) and it was fabulous. Gyro Greek salad was amazing too. I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet!!!!!

I recommend you try this little gem!! It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great little middle eastern deli market! I was looking for some sumac spice and other items and did not want to drive all over to find em. They everything I needed and had lots of unique items too. Call they will tell you if they have it in stock or not! Great prices for the items I bought today 
Super nice owner too !"}
{"text":"I  have    been   buying   food   here    for   15   years   great   food   great   prices  their   Turkish   coffee  in  my  opinion  is   #1   in   Arizona   nice  people   too   !!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend was in the Service and had a craving for some Middle Eastern food so I pulled up Yelp and this seemed to be the closest in my area. I have driven by this place a gajillion times in the last 13 yrs or so and thanks to Yelper's I have learned that not everything is what it seems looks wise. It was 6:30 this Saturday we barely made it in time. It was clean I was happy to sit down inside and get out of the cold.

The server was pretty polite. The food took a little while but it was worth it. I had the Veggie Platter they were out of something they substituted with rice bit it was all good. Great humus and falafel yummmm I want more now lol I love love grape leaves and cant get enough now I know where to go to get my fix! The lentil soup was awesome and served steaming hot in this weather totally hit the spot with fresh pita bread. This was plenty of food perfect for sharing and I'm not even sure I'd ever order that plate for $12.99 on my own. My friend had the lamb kabob and some soup as well and no complaints here either. 

They have hookah's and the good shisha my friend grabbed us some mint flavor which he love's I'm pretty sure its not any cheaper here than say a smoke shop. I saw a sign that said they have whole lambs and they had tons of stuff like gallon Tahini tubs and cute little tea sets among all the food stuff that looked good too. All in all I will be back to try some more delicous eats!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here gyros fries and drink for about 5 bucks. The owner is friendly and the place is clean. Its a small middle eastern store that has a lot of items to try and as far as menu its perfect size to taste some of the middle east.  It has only a few spots to sit but its clean and gives a small neighborhood feel to it. Give yusefs a try I'm sure you'd enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent place drove 15 miles just to come there. Food was all fresh. Taste was A-1."}
{"text":"This place is an okay Middle Eastern place. I was not a fan of the chicken gyro it was tough and did not have any flavor. I do like the chicken kebab but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. The baklava is really good. I bought a henna hair dye and it was old so I won't be doing a lot of shopping there."}
{"text":"I wanted Middle Eastern food from a small mom and pop type place and this place delivered. I like lamb and so I ordered a lamb kabob sandwich. The guy behind the counter asked if I wanted sauce on it. The lamb was juicy and little drops of it ran out of the bottom of my sandwich. There was 4 or 5 large pieces of meat and vegis and the sauce (yogurt) he asked about. Great sandwich and good value. $5.95. I also got the falafel and it was crisp ( not burnt) and delicious. The sauce with it was a chunked tomato and maybe onion in a yogurt sauce. Fantastic, I should have asked for more! I'm sure the gentleman behind the counter would have accommodated my request.  I can't wait to go back and try the hummus and other regional staples."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a take out dinner. I wanted to bring home something different than burgers or a pizza or fried chicken. So I used my Yelp app.... And showed Yusefs nearby with good reviews.

The owner was a very personable person....and very helpful. Everything smelled wonderful, and it was pretty busy....all good signs.

I order 2 of the falafel dinner plates, and the stuffed grape leaves plate. The only \"side\" for a dinner plate was the split pea soup. It was a generous portion....and VERY GOOD!

The falafel and grape leave were both generous portions....and delicious!

I want to go back a do a little grocery shopping for some of the unique items that I think you could find only in Phoenix here.

Good job Yusef! I liked it!"}
{"text":"Yusef's is my old standby place when I crave middle eastern food, Lebanese style.  The Gyros are excellent, right down to the pickle and the sweet onion... mmmmm.  The portions are generous, and everything is always well prepared.  They serve a hummus dis that I really like... it has beef and pine nuts.  The baklavah is good.  They usually have several different varieties.

The place has always been run by really nice people, but the new owners are the nicest people yet.

About a month ago, I was on the way home from visiting my cousin in the hospital when my growling stomach let me know that no food for 12 hours was not making it happy....  I ran into the store at 6:45 pm.  They close at 7.

The owners were at the front counter.... 

\"You're hungry,\" said the woman looking at me with concern

\"yes,\" I nodded  \"Can I get a Gyro, or is it too late.\"

She looked at her husband... \"she's hungry,\" she said to him... 

He hesitated.

\"She's hungry!\" the wife repeated...

I knew they had probably cleaned up already and were getting a sandwich even though it was inconvenient.  I was so grateful.  It was the best Gyro I have EVER had...  

I stop there about once a week now, on my way home from the hospital.  I get a few groceries and something for dinner. I always get there by 6:15 though."}
{"text":"i got the chicken sheesh kabob plate......rice, chicken, and grilled veggies (2 slices of tomato, 2 slices of green pepper, half an onion), lentil soup and bread. 13.00!!! Haji-Babas gives you more for half the price. Plus Haji-Babas gives you some sauce. Come on Yusef! not worth the money"}
{"text":"Got a gyro here. I was dissapointed. small portions of meat, and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato, and WAYYYY too much sauce....It was pretty much pita and tsziki half the time..I had high hopes for this place. :("}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall middle eastern deli. I like their grocery store. You can find many unique and hard to find items. There food is great. LOVE their lentil soup. It is so creamy and flavorful. I have never had lentil soup like this anywhere else. I order it often when I'm sick. Great salad and falafel. Service has always been good. The older man that owns the place is very sweet. 

I just wish they had expanded hours. Last I checked they closed at 7pm and were closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Best Falafel in town!! Have tried many others, but this is probably the best I have had. Extremely authentic, extremely delicious."}
{"text":"Easily the best authentic  Middle Eastern food in town. The market is stellar as well. 

Hours: 7am-8pm"}
{"text":"Really good lentil soup.  Great rice.  Lamb combo was ok but everything else was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Freshly baked pita and flat breads made right on the premises...YUM.  Yusef's is a cool little grocery store, but you can also get an entire meal to go, or just grab a pita for a quick bite to eat.

I tried their veggie combo when I went, and it came with quite a few different items.  It was more than enough to share, so next time, I'll probably end up doing that.

They have a great selection of olives and feta cheese too.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Their chicken lunch is fantastic. They also have a good variety of Middle Eastern groceries. I especially like their cheese selections.  They owners are very hospitable"}
{"text":"I usually come here once or twice a week. I love their gyros and fries - both very authentic and served Chicago-style. The staff are very friendly and accommodating, and they serve some good desserts as well. Good selection of Middle Eastern sodas, snacks, and other ingredients as well. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"As a lover of Middle Eastern food and being half Lebanese I found this place to be great. I had the kefta sandwich and enjoyed it. Also if you are looking for grocery items they have some great ingredients."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The prices are very reasonable. The people are pleasant. In addition to the four tables for dining in, there is a fascinating array of groceries for sale. We always end up with a few items to take home. The ambience is fine except for the constant sound of refrigerators, which sound in need of help. This is overall a gem."}
{"text":"Alli can say is thank God they changed owners. The new owner is fantastic. Nice. Helpful. Smiles too!!! Plus they have all the goodies I need. The string cheese. The bulghur pilaf. The salted pumpkin seeds. And the Persian cucumbers. My new favorite!"}
{"text":"I've only been inside once for a jar of Nutella.  I know, kinda strange that I would stop at Yusef's for a jar of Nutella but I live right by the place and every deli has Nutella (and Yusef's did too, see-- I told you).

Anyhow, I like this place for one really odd reason-- my Dad buys cherry juice at Yusef's by the case-- he says it helps his kidney stones.  My dad likes the owner and I think they are nice to him, so I am happy about that.

I would like to try some of the fresh food they make, I'll need to make sure I take mental note to do so."}

6 Star Falafel !    IT'S GREEN!

Seriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!

It really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of \"Magic Falafel\" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.  
     8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbt
I can do box all by myself.

Various kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches -- 
the menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be. 
They've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.  
Yusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!

Perusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of \"What the heck is THIS!?\".  

Spice grinders!  Pomegranate juice! Curry powder! Turkish coffee pots!  Anchovie fillets! Fresh Olives! Tamarind extract!
I'm ready for the PARTY!  Where's the Houkka?  THERE IT IS! Up on the wall, several to choose from actually.

My green falafel sandwich was freshly made, hot, and delicious.
Still the best falafel in the Phoenix area (but sadly, it was found to be \"Magic\" only in it's tasty savory goodness).   Only $5.99 with a soda, or check with the owner on bartering your knit sweater-making skills.

Can anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert?"}
{"text":"Have not been here for many years. Place is a Middle Eastern  market and restaurant located in a strip mall. They have 3 tables for seating and about a dozen chairs. Ordered a gyro and meatless grape leaves (Dolmades). 

Gyro was very good, had the right balance of flavor and texture. The pita bread was excellent. The order of Dolmades had 4 stuffed grape leaves. The order was served hot and had a unique flavor. It had chick peas, rice, and onion with flavorful herbs. It was served with a yougart sauce. 

Place is the real deal. Great market items too. Saved this to my favorite list for authentic Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Falafel is outstanding here, dark exterior with green interior, and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying.  Cooked just right too for texture.  Fries are a nice side.  Prices reasonable here, plenty of parking, and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge.  Note that there's just a few seats inside, since this is also a grocery place.  To-go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination."}
