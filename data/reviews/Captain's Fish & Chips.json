{"text":"I decided to try this place because of some rave reviews on one of the foodie forums. This is literally a hole-in-the wall place that took us a while to find. Because it is situated at Brentwood Mall, the address is really vague. We drove around the whole mall before we could find it. It is actually tucked in the corner, located near the Ginger Beef Peking House and next door to a Dollar Store towards the west side of the mall.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in but there were enough people there that gave me some confidence this place would be at least half decent. While the decor is nothing to write about, the prices were very reasonable. A order of 2-piece halibut & chips was $13.95. The fish was very juicy and the batter was crisp.  The french fries were fresh out of the fryer. The food was not that greasy. I wouldn't say it's the best fish and chips I've ever had in Calgary. But I was happy that my order was very fresh. And for that price, I would say it is pretty good value for what you get."}
{"text":"This location is just located left of my dentist's office and I do love a good fish and chip.  From the outside I noticed ol' skool picnic benches so I thought okay I will give the Captain a chance.  

But when I entered I completely changed my nautical tune.  The place was empty; how odd for lunchtime plus it was really messy.  Used utensils and condiments littered most table tops and the owner was in there alone reading a newspaper.  

I found the prices pretty high 15 dollars for two piece halibut, pricier for other options and while I pretended to peruse the menu, I could actually see the fresh fish sitting on the sink in the backroom.  It really subdued my appetite, I mean I eat anything, I am a cowgirl after all, but within reason. For me to turn away from an establishment is usually unheard of.

I did not try the fish nor the chips, I just couldn't stomach eating those fish filets that seemed to be sitting outside for who know how long.  But I trust my intuition and no matter how friendly the owner seemed I don't think I would come back to order any fish here.

For a great fish and chips for 2 filets at 8.95, I highly recommend the lower level at the Bay."}
{"text":"Although, I am a sea food lover in general, i am very picky about the restaurants i dine at. So when i do write a good review about a sea food restaurant it has to be good. What i like specifically about this restaurant is that you do not have to wait long for the food to be served and they know how to cook fish n chips really crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"The fish n chips here are a hit or miss item. Sometimes RAD sometimes garbage.

When you walk in, a WALL of fishy grease smell hits you in the face, HARD. The ventilation must be defective or non-existent and it has been this way since the first time I went to Captains way back in 1995 or so (I think). SO they NEVER change the oil and / or ventilation equipment, makes you wonder about the rest of the place.

CASH ONLY!!! No cards of any kind, and the last time I was there (June 2008) the guy was abrupt and rude, probably because he is choked about his failing business.

Old newspapers, used plastic utensils, etc etc litter some of the tables even though the place is empty and the guy is just sitting behind the counter doing nothing. No music, no ambience, the only sound to break the silence was a snowy 1980s TV turned to channel whatever.

The \"theory\" of this place (small, independent, \"secret\" , etc) is appealing, but in execution its pretty scary.

In spite of all this, I WOULD recommend going here for a 2 piece, because when its good, it IS really good. Just prepare yourself for the stank in there and dont wear your good clothes."}
