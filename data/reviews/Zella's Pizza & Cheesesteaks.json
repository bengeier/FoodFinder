{"text":"I live nearby so I thought I'd try their wings. I was very disappointed. The wings were so small that it would take 3 wings to equal one regular sized wing. I won't be back."}
{"text":"First off I would like to state that I love pizza! There is nothing better than getting a good pizza on a Friday night with a movie. I decided tonight would be that night, but unfortunately for us I picked the wrong pizza place. The following reasons are why I will not be returning to Zella's pizza and cheese sticks;
1. Cajun sticks - although the idea sounded great the execution was poor. I'm all for greasy, but when it drips down your wrist to your elbow you've got an issue. Also in order to find the cajun flavor, you have to fight through an army of salt. I took one bite and realized that one bread stick would've been a great assassination weapon against Sponge Bob!
2. NY style pizza - there were two positive things about the pizza; the size was really big and the flavored crust wasn't horrible. Now I've had NY style pizza before and I know it's supposed to have light sauce, but no sauce at all! Really?! Bad choice Zella's.  Also chewing the crust was like a wrestling match in my mouth, tough! My teeth hurt after two pieces and that was just plain disappointing! 

Overall I would say too greasy, too salty, no sauce and way too tough. Side note they overcharged me. Boo! Time to look for a new pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Zella's best pizza in town.. Large menu plenty of options everything's made fresh!! Deff going back!!"}
{"text":"great pizza and friendly staff great combination, real pizza!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and every time it keeps getting better, I had the toasted subs and WOW, it was unbelievable steak cheese and mushrooms, i got it with no mushrooms tho, they have a zellas sauce don't forget to try that with it, it's awesome. Try the baked fries you can't go wrong. This is my pizza place for life."}
{"text":"I would say after a few visits I've had the $5 dollar pizza which for $5 hey you would expect cardboard but it's a great pizza for 5. 
I myself am a newyork style person and from back east they have it dialed in. Great pizza, I got double pepp garlic Cajun crust well done. Perfect. I do have a five star rating for the toasted subs had the buffalo and the steak. Both perfect. Thx for putting a store so close to me."}
{"text":"Waiting for my husband's flight to come in at the airport, decided to stop by and try this place. Ordered the ham and cheese half sub and fries. Everything was hot and fresh tasting, yum! Fries are perfect. Will order a pizza next time and try that! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My fellow New Yorker told me it was a good pizza. When I heard they charge $5 for a pie I knew it could not be good it's a Domino's Pizza Hut Papa Johns Hungry Howies type of pizza.. I happen to have own three pizzerias back east of my grandfather opened up the second pizzeria in American in Coney Island so I think I know good pizza.. Let's start with the cheese the best cheese you can use is called Grande cheese it melts perfectly on the pie and you could taste it.. the cheese on zellars  is one of the cheapest  you can use I don't know what brand cheese he buys but it wasn't good.. Sauce had no flavor it was like he poured  it out of a can and just put it on the pizza.  the crust what soft I felt like I was eating a sponge.. Overall if I could give it a 0 I would..."}
{"text":"Zella's your place is really amazing. It's quiet, but it's nice to be able to enjoy your pizza when it's to yourself. Overall it was a good experience your employee was good. What I loved most is how the pizza was set up, maybe there's pictures here but I don't want to ruin it for someone that visits. Anyways. It was great, big pizza, awesome service overall all good."}
{"text":"This place was okay , my sandwich was okay but messy, cheese fries were okay nothing great, my daughter slice of pizza was so super thin and the sauce was only on the top half of the pizza , prolly won't come ever again wouldn't recommend either"}
{"text":"Service here is great. Went in on Saturday evening. Our subs came out at a decent time and  Place was clean and friendly counter guys."}
{"text":"Pros: Hot, flavorful, and not drenched in oil.
Cons: Forgetful orders, skimpy toppings. 

I'm going to be frank: I'm a pizza snob. I love only my husband and cats more than I love pizza, and some days, it's a three-way draw. Zella's pizza simply doesn't live up to the standards of a timelessly good pizza. Very thin, flavorless crust (needs more salt, guys), but doughy and chewy, the way crust should be. Almost no sauce, and--other than pepperoni--my Hawaiian pizza had very few other toppings (and considering I paid an extra 1.50, I kinda hoped to have more than just 10 pepperoncini slices). It satisfied my pizza craving, but I can't say I'll order a pie from them again. 

However, these garlic breadsticks! Sweet six pound, eight ounce baby Jesus, these garlic breadsticks are enough to make me go back. Four bucks for twenty chewy, rich, warm, actually-covered-in-garlic-and-butter sticks? Nailed it, Zella's. You've got my business there."}
{"text":"First timer here. Not a family member. Got the chicken parm sub which was surprisingly better than expected. Took off one star due to slow service. Will come back to try the pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Good pizza, not pricey, close by. I had a pesto chicken sandwich here last week and maybe I was just really hungry...but it was soooo good. Zellas has been consistently good which earns them three stars. Added a forth for that chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"First time to come here. Called ahead an order for pickup. When I got to the restaurant no order. Had to reorder was quoted 15 minutes and it took 20 minutes. The time would have been no big deal if my order wasn't missed in the first place. Mistakes happen but I expect that you should go above and beyond to make it up and they didn't. I had the mushroom philly the bun was soft and fresh the meat was well cooked and seasoned, but was lacking mushrooms. A bit overpriced for what you get. My wife had the chef salad that she said was good. It was well portioned and reasonably priced. The fried pickles were alright. Overall the food was alright but the service was poor."}
{"text":"We were out for the day doing some shopping. We saw Zellas is and read the reviews before we went in.
So glad we stopped in.

Had the deep dish pizza...tasted great. The cheese was flavorful, the sauce was put on just right. The pepperoni tasted great the sausage wasn't the  over powerful taste like you get at other places. The crust was crispy on the bottom and light and airy on the inside..filling crust that didn't taste doughy or make you feel heavy.

My wife had the salad. The lettuce was chopped into small pieces so that you could manage a bite  without worrying about your mouth looking like you just took a big mouthful. She had the Cranberry Pecan. Everything was the right mix. It had feta cheese mixed in. The lettuce was crispy chilled. She said she'd order it again.

Service was fast & very friendly. Highly recommend this place.

AWESOME

{"text":"Just had delivery from them, it's my first time eating from Zella's. I have say they were great over the phone, very friendly. I didn't have wait long for my delivery as well. Great, considering I'm about 5 miles away. I got exactly what I ordered!  Although I was surprised to see the pizza was really thin which is not my preference but once I took a bite, it was yummy! Taste very fresh. The wings are DELICIOUS, my daughter couldn't get enough!!! My tummy is very happy right now!"}
{"text":"Great food all the way around. Just had one of the many Philly's today. Delicious! Can't wait to try the others. Friendly staff always up for a chat and the smiles, friendliness and service are non-stop. Great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Usually ordering from Zellas is a great experience. Well tonight was a completely different story. I ordered as usual through grubhub. Usually it takes about 45 minutes to an hour. No big deal that's normal for pizza.  Well tonight it took longer than quoted. So I called and the person  answering was rude and didn't bother to apologize, just repeated how busy and short staffed they were. Well 20 minutes after the hour markers my food got here, cold. I asked the driver when he got here if he had a phone that he could have called to let me know my food was going to be late and he shrugged and said 'yeah I guess I could have' and then he turns and leaves. When did customer service become non existent? The food is good though."}
{"text":"Great Full size Pizza for only 5$,four different kinds of crust to choose from.And there is no extra charge for extra cheese or sauce.I highly recomend it especially if your on a budget :-)"}
{"text":"My cashier was very personable and friendly. Come to find out she worked an hour late, and was still happy. Pizza was good, and for $5, I got plenty of food without denting my pocket. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Watch out for extra charges. Ordered two subs @ 7.50 each. Decided to change one 7.50 sub to a $10 sub. The cashier said the difference would be $6.00. on the other hand the food is really good. Just wish the cashier would have explained charges better than spinning the register around and saying \"this is what the computer says.\""}
{"text":"This place is not bad for a quick lunch and the interior is nicely designed. The staff were friendly and the food came out fast. However, the food quality was a little below my expectations. It was not bad, just less than I expected based on price and location."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place A+++ service I had the manager Brian he was so nice over the phone and really took his time on my order and made sure everything was right so thank u Zellas # new favorite place # thanks Brian # Zellas for life !!!!!!"}
{"text":"OK... I decided to give this place a chance. Always willing to try the underdogs of pizza places. I wish I would have ordered else where. The pizza was flavorless I don't know how you can manage to suck the flavor out of meat, cheese, and pizza sauce. But they managed. I got a side of bread sticks Parmesan and garlic and it tasted like I was eating cardboard. Even the dipping sauce had no flavor. The ranch had no flavor! The most flavorful part of this meal was the Soda..."}
{"text":"Good portions and great tasting food. Low prices and discount for service members make this place a good eating destination."}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear from the owner, Jason, thanking me for my feedback and promising to talk with the cooks. We went back a few days later and the salt content was dramatically lower. Everything was wonderful. The cheese steaks, pizza, hoagies, mushrooms, and burgers at this place are beyond phenomenal. Being from Pennsylvania originally, I was craving cheese steaks like they made back home and these are the closest I've ever found."}
{"text":"We love how fast and affordable their pizza is and we always pick up.  If your looking for for gourmet pizza, keep looking.  However, if you are looking for fast, affordable yummy pizza, perfect!"}
{"text":"1st time ordered today and had it delivered by GrubHub. It took over an hour to get our two Philly cheese steaks a order of sweet potato frys and a chicken fajita salad. The salad was so salty we could not eat it (trashed) both of the sandwiches were also very salty not as bad as the salad but still way too much.  I think the food would be ok if they held back on salt shaker... iffy if we will eat there again. If we do, we'll have to tell them No Salt."}
{"text":"I ordered food from Zella's this evening through GrubHub, as I have several times before without problems. Tonight, however, would prove to be a very different experience. First, I got a call from the restaurant, and when I answered, I was hung up on. So, giving them the benefit of the doubt, I called back. I was then placed on hold and hung up on again. So, a little irritated at this point, I called back a second time and asked expressly NOT to be placed on hold again. The gentleman answering was polite enough, but after hearing I was calling back because I figured they wanted to confirm my order, he told me I had to speak with the Manager on duty. The Manager explained they wanted to cancel my order because my family has a lot of food allergies, and they were not comfortable about being able to prepare the food without cross-contamination. I was pleasantly surprised they were so concerned, but reassured him I order from Zella's fairly frequently without problem. He explained that Zella's has been under new ownership for about two months, and he was not there prior to that time.  After clarifying my family's situation, the Manager agreed to make the order anyhow. Fast forward 90 minutes, and the food had still not arrived, so I called back yet again to check on the status of my order. I spoke with a young lady who confirmed my address and said the driver was, \"on the way with my food.\" Yet another 45 minutes later, and still no food. At this point, my children are getting very upset, and I am more than a little annoyed, as we are all very hungry, and we have been waiting over two hours from the time my order was placed. So, I call back a fourth time and ask for a Manager. This time, I get another Manager (different than the first one I spoke with), who promptly tells me there will be no food coming, as they cancelled it immediately after it was placed due to \"the large amount of food restrictions.\" I explained to her that I had already spoken with another Manager at the time the order was placed who agreed to make the food in spite of the restrictions, and to a second person 30 minutes before calling this last time who confirmed the food was made and on it's way. I then asked if she meant to tell me / confirm I was lied to TWICE by members of her staff, and she said, \"Yes.\"

Suffice it to say, I was / am beyond upset at this point. With no other recourse, I suggested she have a serious conversation with her staff about their dishonesty and lack of integrity.  I used to enjoy eating at Zella's, but I will never know if the food is still as good or better than it was under the last owner. I refuse to support the dispassionate den of ineptitude, disorganization, and laziness Zella's has become under it's new ownership, and I urge any who read this not to support them either. Good day!"}
{"text":"Eugene made the best chicken pesto sandwich ever! Tessa always has the best service! This place is the best, very satisfied. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This was ok pizza for a chain. It was delivered at a party I attended, was hot and tasty, but the crust was way to chewy and thick"}
{"text":"Very surprised on the quality and taste of Zella's food. Their burgers are really good, comparable to Red Robin's. We've tried a little of everything on the menu and it's all been delicious."}
{"text":"Have to say one of the best new eateries around town. The Toasted Garlic Chicken Sub with a side of suicide garlic sauce is definitely my favorite sandwich of all times. The Garlic sauce is whipped from fresh Garlic and mixed with the ghost pepper suicide sauce, makes my mouth water just thinking about it. When I feel like having a cheat meal the Meatza Pizza with garlic crust is my go to. I would normally pay about $20 for a pie like that and they only charge $12. What a steal. Best food and bang for your buck. Looking forward to trying other items. I also love that the kitchen is open and you can actually see how clean the whole place is. Great and friendly staff. Being a business owner myself I really love the fact that it's a family owned and operated restaurant."}
{"text":"Slowest delivery ever. 1.5hr wait time. 

Ordered a Hawaiian and bacon fries through the EAT24 thing here on Yelp. Got a confirmation email and everything. An hour goes by and nothing got delivered yet. So I call and ask what's going on and they say they barely got the order and it would be another 30min. Absolutely ridiculous. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"I received a menu flyer on my doorknob last week and decided to give Zella's a try. I called and spoke with a gruff gentleman who took my order. I purchased the large, one-topping (pepperoni was my choice) pizza with garlic parmesan breadsticks and a 2-liter coke. The total was 10.83 (carryout). 

PROS: Pizza was worth $5--not overly greasy and enough toppings. They sell Coke products--I hate Pepsi. 15 minute turnaround time, so not a long wait.

CONS: Breadsticks were only \"ok\"--will not purchase again. Also, the guy at the counter was seriously lacking in customer service skills. I stood there (no other customers in lobby) directly in front of him for like three minutes while he was writing something down before he even acknowledged me. Not a big deal, because it's just a pizza pickup, but I knocked off one star for that. Not a 5 star experience but I will definitely be back. 

TL; DR: Get the $5 pizza, skip the breadsticks, Coke products if thirsty, short wait time for carryout, and lackluster customer service"}
{"text":"I've only had the pizza here but it's definitely the best pizza I've had in AZ! I've tried every place in the Gilbert/chandler area and this is the best x1000! My boyfriend is from NY and he agrees that this pizza is incredible. Perfect NY style pizza. It's also reasonably priced which is great! I also see that other reviewers say it's slow but it only takes 30 mins from the time I order the pizza to the arrival at my house which is pretty quick to me.."}
{"text":"Good pizza and my only hesitation on giving it a higher review is that we thought the pizza was too salty. We ordered a double cheese. I don't know if they can control this but otherwise a good thin pizza. The people behind the counter listen and are willing to accommodate their customers!"}
{"text":"This place is phanominal. I can just get a slice o pizza or a half a sub. I love it. It's also very clean and the staff is super friendly. THANKS"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I will say that the butter cheese crust is addicting! Outside of the pizza we only order wings a few times and they are just meh. Nothing spectacular. Every salad I've ordered either tastes like dish soap or is just weird tasting veggies. But it's pizza they do right. 

Pick up your pizza... it takes about 10 minutes for them to make it usually. I can order get in the car and pick up no problem. It's also only $5 for a large pizza picked up. 

  Delivery takes 45min-2 hours  and you have to order a min 15$ then they add delivery fees so it's $20 min for 2 pizzas. And they expect you to tip the driver... 

I guess if you need a job delivering pizzas this is the place to apply because they never have reliable drivers. 

I store staff is friendly . The inside is clean. Only 3* because delivery sucks. Which for pizza night is a bummer. However  we are loyal customers and get pizza every Friday simply because the Pizza is that good. I think maybe they need another north phoenix location and it might help with delivery times."}
{"text":"We ordered a thin crust and an original crust pizza plus some philly fries tonight. This is the first time we have tried Zella's. Yuk! This pizza was terrible. Bad dough, bad sauce, not enough cheese! I do not recommend this place for pizza!!! The philly fries were amazing though!"}
{"text":"Ordered very basic meal - pizza and wings at 5pm and was told should arrive within 30-35 minutes.  Perfect timing, however the promised time came and went and shortly after 6pm the food arrived ice cold.  

If they're backed up, just be up front with the customer and don't promise what you can't deliver (and still ensure it gets to the customer hot).  

Many other options in area for similar food quality and much better service."}
{"text":"Salad and cheesy breadsticks were very good. Very clean and nice, friendly staff. USB charging stations at each booth!!"}
{"text":"This is a new place close to my house and so I thought it could be great. 
I have to admit, the first thing I noticed was how unprofessional everyone seemed. People going in and out of the back door, presumably smoking and taking breaks, workers talking loudly, playing games, ignoring customers, and seemingly handling food without due care. On my first visit, I was just in the shopping mall doing some other business so stopped in for a quick slice. The girl at the counter was completely flustered and told me they don't sell slices after 4pm. I informed her is was only a little after 3, she then got even more flustered and told me that they didn't have any. OK, reasonable enough I guess, but then I actually had to push her to give me a to go menu to take with me. Odd, I thought, like they really don't care at all if the store does business or not.

Next day I decided I had time and would call in a take out pizza. I did not go for the cheapo $5 special and went for my usual favorite with the works. The phone rang and rang and rang. Finally a guy answered who sounded totally out of it. As I tried to order, he would completely ignore what I had said, and then ask other bizarre questions. I had to repeat things several times and came very close to just hanging up, but I really wanted to give me them a chance. 

When I went in to pick it up, they were all in the back again having some kind of party or break or something. The pizza was sitting on a counter, had not been boxed or cut, and so the girl got all flustered. Just really weird.

In any event, got the pizza home, it was a bit cold, but to be completely honest it just wasn't that good and considering I had spent $30 for an extra large with deluxe toppings and extra cheese it was light as air with virtually no toppings on it. Waste of money, poor service, completely unsupervised workers. 

I will say the crust was pretty good, and the toppings if they actually put more on the pizza could have been good, but the owner really needs to know that the staff is out of control and the business will never succeed unless some major changes in supervision occur."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible when placing an order to go via telephone. Tried giving specific directions to my home and was denied. After waiting an hour I called and was told it was in route. After another fifteen minutes finally a driver called who was at the wrong address after trying to explain directions take my home for ten minutes. When I called to speak to a manager and still speaking I was put on hold! Finally canceled the order after waiting an hour and a half and making two phone calls to see where the order was at! No coupon or discount will ever change my mind... I will never eat here and Im new to Phoenix! Thanks for ruining our family dinner and experience!"}
{"text":"Good pizza at an excellent price, the water tasted weird and the fries were okay. Great customer service and nice atmosphere. This would be a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"By far my new favorite local pizza joint! Great place to go as a family on a Friday night! Can't make it out? Dont worry they deliver too! $5 pizzas everyday too - can't best those prices when you have a large family.  The toasted sub's are huge and delish!! I also suggest the baked fries - the buffalo chicken are addicting so be warned! Great atmosphere, great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Not impressed on my 1st visit. I walk in and there are only two tables with customers around 6pm, which I think is great thinking I missed a dinner rush. 

I ordered the Famous Philly and after paying was told it would take about 15 minutes. No reason why was given. I was the only one in store waiting on food, maybe they had a large to go order being prepped, but it seemed odd.  I was pleased that it did not take the full 15 minutes, but the sandwich was unimpressive. The cheese wiz had dry chunks in it that was really in appetizing and the rest was just kind of bland. Not a horrible experience, but probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The only reason this place doesn't get 2 stars is that the price is good.  Called to place order and the girl I spoke with was polite, however when I went to pick up my order it was a different story.  The cashier was talking to the delivery guy and completely ignored me for 5 mins. No hello no we will be with u momentarily nothing..... Then the girl who handed me the order had seriously long acrylic nails with some that were broken off.  Long like how do u hold a pen long.... Hygiene is very questionable.   Usually when u work at a food establishment nails like that are not allowed.  Also at the counter was a bottle of spray cleaner and a dirty rag just sitting there. Not appetizing for people walking in at all.  Food was cheap greasy but pretty much expected for price.  I won't be back solely on service (rude) and hygiene."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE the Hawaiian Pizza on thin crust from Zella's. We only do takeout and this place definitely has issues. Only 1-2 times they had our order ready when we came to pick up. Multiple times we would arrive and pay... Sit around waiting for our order.... only to find out they haven't even started making our pizza yet! If the Hawaiian pizza wasn't so good and we didn't love it so much... We would probably never ever come back. Employees probably need to be trained better and actually have our food ready when quoted... If it not going to be ready in 15 minutes then don't say it will be! So irritating."}
{"text":"I love Zella's!! I'm so surprised in the negative reviews! This pizza is super affordable and loaded with taste! I got a large pep with breadsticks for $9.75!! It's way way better than little Caesars and ready in 15! It tastes like quality ingredients rather than cardboard! This place is absolutely worth a shot! For the price you have nothing to lose!! Ohhhh did I mentioned you get to pick your crust?!? Butter cheese Mmmm!!"}
{"text":"I came in on a fairly busy saturday around 4pm and I was greeted by this joyful girl. She was so helpful and reccommended so many items on the menu. I deff loved how patient she was! The food came quickly and was quite tasty. Then her wonderful manger walked up and asked me how the food was. I have has an amazing experience. I can't wait to come back and try the phillies next time I'm there. Keep up the good work Zella's employees Azeeza and Danielle :)"}
{"text":"First time ordering and we loved it. The gluten free pizza was the best I've had yet. My husband had the regular and declared it the most delicious pizza he'd had in a long time. We will definitely be ordering from Zella's again. Looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Big fan. Order carry out almost weekly, if not weekly. Sadly, tonight's carryout order did not include the salad I ordered...teenage daughter didn't know I ordered one. Super bummed"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Just had the house salad and it is huge! The lettuce is crispy and not soggy. 
My new place for salad. 
Also, the vegetarian cheese steak is delicious!"}
{"text":"$5  pizza one topping with flavored crust - pretty quick - Staff has been great a couple times I have popped in -- definitely  better pizza than some other places to pop in for a $5 pizza -"}
{"text":"Best Cheesesteak in Phoenix!! The wife and I went there yesterday and one of the owners (Mikey) treated us like family. We informed him that we'd just moved into the neighborhood and he through in 2 free fountain drinks on him. Over finally ringing us up he realized he didn't add my Greek fries before telling me the price of the order and through those in too!!! Now that's how you build your clientele!!! Thanks Mikey!!!!"}
{"text":"There are many places to get take-out/delivery in the East Valley.  There are only a handful that I use consistently....and this place is now one of them!  When I am hungry...I am H-ANGRY....and for this reason, when I order delivery, I expect fast, hot food that tastes great and can satiate the animal in my gut before I smash the fridge!

We have ordered from Zella's multiple times.  Each time, the food was delivered quickly and came to our door hot, which on its own, definitely isn't worth 5 stars because these are things you expect from a delivery place, especially when you live a mile away.

What sets Zella's apart is the quality of the food.  We have ordered multiple items  and below is a breakdown:

Baked Fries:  ORDER THESE!  It doesn't matter what kind...all are MIND NUMBINGLY GOOD. We have tried several and they come SUPER hot, and covered in sauce/toppings/cheese etc.  This place has some magical way of baking the fries so that most of the fries are CRISPY.....EVEN WITH ALL THE CRAZY TOPPINGS!!!  This being said...if you are on a diet, STILL ORDER THESE.  You can do an extra mile or ten on the treadmill the next day and it is WORTH IT.

Wings: Boneless or bone-in?  Either.  The bone-in come NOT breaded, just crispy and not swimming in sauce.  The hot buffalo sauce might be from out of a bottle (I honestly don't know), but who cares! The wings are not swimming in it and are not those gross, fatty, grisly kind that some places serve.  The boneless wings are breaded but actually contain meat, and not just breaded grisle.  What's more: despite being sauced, the breading is still crispy and the wings are hot! Crazy!

TOASTED SUBS:  I put that in caps because they are AMAZING.  They aren't the run-though-a-toaster kind that some places offer.  They are buttered and Panini pressed or something.....again, I am not sure quite how it is done, but they come hot, crusty, buttery, and AMAZING.  Full disclosure: I even tried the veggie one.  AND IT BLEW MY MIND.  A sub without meat!?  Being amazing?! Yes.  Somehow....even their veggie toasted sub is amazing.

Pizza:  Their pizza is pretty good.  To be honest, we have not tried many of the options available but it did come hot, not too saucy and the crust was crispy.  Great pizza is easy to find here in Gilbert and Zella's is definitely better than mediocre. They offer choices for crust flavorings, which seems to be the standard now for pizza places.  What stands out is the price.  It is way better pizza than what they charge so if you have a bunch of hungry kids or pizza party or something, you are better off getting this instead of the Diabetes-inducing-garbage other chains out there call pizza.....and at least you can enjoy it as an adult.

Burger:  Oddly....it was REALLY good (which you do not expect from a pizza/cheesesteak place).  The patties are not exactly chargrilled (like on a home grill) but they are juicy.  They remind me of a bigger version of a fast food patty (which, if you are like me, you know you LOVE....deep down inside....but pretend not to!). They are not overly huge but not tiny either and it comes with 2 patties already.  The best part: YOU CAN ADD EXTRA PATTIES!!!!  So for instance....IF I want to, I can have my own burger-food-challenge every night in the comfort of my own home....and do it in my underwear!!!  The only downside is that the burger toppings appeared to be the same toppings they use on the pizza, but honestly...can you blame them!?  And it is not like my burger was any less awesome because of it.

FRIED PICKLES:  Personally, I prefer the coins to the spears (most people do, for those that know what I am talking about!).  That being stated, let me ask you.....Have you ever had a BAD fried pickle??  I thought not.  And you won't find a bad one here.

Customer Service:  I say it in every review I write:  good food is easy to find but good customer service is rare.  This place shines.  If they goof up your order, they are apologetic and do everything in their power to make it right, trust me, I know. No matter how good food is, no place is worth ordering from if they treat you like garbage.  This place does an amazing job of making its customers feel important and valued.

OVERALL:  Delivery was fast and food came hot.  The price is extremely fair for how good the food is.  Customer service is exceptional, though that is not to say there have not been a few bumps in our order history, but they have been resolved straight away.  All food we have ordered has been exceptional and better than what they charge for it. 

BOTTOM LINE:  It has something for everyone. The potential to create a GIANT burger will appease the meat lovers.  Vegetarians can love the veggie options (which are ACTUALLY YUMMY!).  Pizza lovers will enjoy the ability to create a delicious pizza that doesn't taste like plastic and NOT break the bank.  Those of you on a diet....you shout STOP dieting and just eat at this place anyway."}
{"text":"Super total awesome... Ordered my pie over the phone for delivery and got exactly what I ordered!! Nice right? But there is more- the driver called me to make sure she was gonna find my apartment. Not an easy task for my particular demographic. 

Driver was cool. Food was spot on. Time of order + Time of delivery = 1 happy customer"}

Ordered the \"original workz\" pizza it was okay. The Boneless hot wings and fried pickles left more to be desired.  Dry and  sauce less chicken mini balls ( they were the size of a quarter on average.  The fried pickles were burnt and disappointing. 

Bottom line it is cheap food and okay. You can do a lot worse for a lot more. But I have had a lot better for a lot less. 

I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  We had the $5 Pepperoni pizza with the butter cheese crust seasoning.  We usually get Little Caesers and this beat the hell out of that.  Though not the best pizza we've ever had, it was really good for the price."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had s coupon for a large pizza with up to 5 toppings. Ordered a Hawaiian and was told that was a specially pizza and couldn't use the coupon... So I ordered a large pizza with the same ingredients. They took the coupon. Also ordered boneless wings and zucchini stix. Pizza took FOREVER to come out.... Wing and zucchini came Much later. And guess what? The wings weren't boneless. By then we had to go so we just got our money back for the wings and left. Zucchini stix were delicious though."}
{"text":"Yeah, I've had a couple minor service issues over maybe 7 or 8 visits, but when the cook correctly executes a 2x garlic crust, it will clear your sinuses in a pretty wonderful way, whether it's a bargain $5 one top, or the 5 top, for a competitively priced $13 w/ tax.

I've learned to open my pizza box for inspection right at the counter and before I take it away to avoid disappointment at home.
You do need to be a bit proactive and aware here,  but the pizzas I've had have been a good value for me."}
{"text":"Yeah, not good... I was there on the first night, and have been back a few times. I never give a review after just one visit. The pizza's are maybe equal to Little Caesar's. I have to agree with an earlier review, Isa's, which is across the street, is much better but will cost more. If you need a few pizza's for a kids party, this place is good for you. They are cheap. The problem with that is that they even taste cheap. My wife has had the Meatball sub. It looked great. And she loved it. The bread was very good. For me, I am a cheesesteak fan.. Their \"Famous Philly\" is a joke. I give a bonus point for the cheese. The bread is very good.. It's the lack of any meat on the sub that makes it a joke. When you can bite into a philly you will never get all bread. I really wanted this place to rock. It is just 1.5 miles from my home. I can get a good cheesesteak and fries at a Packers bar on Bell and spend less..  If you want cheap and poor quality, go to Zella's. Best thing that has happened for this store is that Goodwill has opened up near by. That will keep them in business with people who can not afford good food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, French fries, and a Caesar salad.

The sandwich was delicious. I would definitely order it again. The French fries were just ok; could have used some seasoning or something. I would never get the Caesar salad again though. Something was off with the dressing and I couldn't get past it so the salad went to waste.

I ordered through Yelp and had it delivered. That was highly convenient! There is a $15 minimum pre-tax for delivery, which makes sense. Delivery is $3 or $3.50, can't remember which. Took 45 minutes to arrive, which was the latter end of the time frame provided.

All in all, I would definitely order food from here again but maybe just the sandwich..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery they said it would be 45 min. Only took 30 ...chicken bacon ranch Sammi and bbq Philly so good .. keep rockin it Zella"}
{"text":"First time and last time I will order from this place. Ordered two pizzas and some wings with a two liter. Not only was the delivery 30 minutes more then what they quoted me. I called in an hour after I ordered and they said \"oh it's on its way.\" I live less then half a mile away. Twenty minutes later I get my pizza. Then the delivery guy forgot my 2liter. Said it was just in his car. Fifteen minutes later. Pizza is ate, wings are cold. And I still don't have my 2liter."}
{"text":"Ordered a meat lovers pizza. Everyone loved it. Asked for extra cheese and they added it on without any hassle. Waited for it at the location. Location was clean and lots of TV's to bring the kids or to watch sports. We also ordered the cheeses take fries. Everything was great. Not too salty. Just right. After reading the previous posts if you're a pizza snob then there are plenty of locations out in Scottsdale but this place works just right for us. Last time we also ordered a meatball sandwich and buffalo chicken fries. Both great. Sandwich was just right and had right amount of sauce and meatballs and cheese. Bread was also tasted and flavorful."}
{"text":"Well.. we ordered a simple cheese pizza and a few wings. It has been over 2hrs and we have yet to receive our order. Unfortunately, it was also a night that we had plans.

I don't care how great the food is.. if it takes 2 hours and they charge me $6 to deliver it.. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Pecan salad add chicken, so yummmm!!! Cheese bread delicious, husband loves the cheese stake. Order is always done right even though we always have changes."}
{"text":"just ordered are 1st pizza from this place.. a lg Hawaiian pizza to go....  fresh,hot, delicious NYC pizza..  $10.00  
a 10"}
{"text":"A quick note to the owner.  When someone calls in to reserve a party of 15 you might want to stop and remind yourself that is a good thing!!  Not spew out some passive aggressive statement about that it is the busiest night of the week.  Our team will have their end of the year banquet at a place that welcomes business not some place that doesn't want to be inconvenienced with the dreaded \"Customer\".  Good luck with your business model."}
{"text":"The most overpriced, and small cheesesteak I've ever had in my life. Paired with the long wait time and sub par flavor, I would not recommend Zella's to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"I had received multiple ads with coupons and was really excited to try this place. 

When I called to place my order it seemed like the person taking the order was in a rush. When I got off the phone I told my husband how it was weird they didn't take a name or a number, but I figured maybe they had caller ID and things would figure themselves out. 

My husband went to pick up the order, and they asked for a name and he told them that the person did not ask for a name but told them what we had ordered. They had him sit down and wait for over 30 minutes until someone else came in and the same issue happened with them where the person did not ask for a name. Meanwhile our food had been sitting ready on the counter for us to pick up the WHOLE TIME. 

So the pizza was of course room temperature when he got to take it home, making it less than good when we finally got to sit down and eat it. Maybe the food would have been good if it was fresh, this is hard to say though.  

They could have redeemed themselves by giving us a discount on our cold less than stellar pizza or given us some sort of voucher to try the place again, but they did not. I say train your staff to problem solve so they can find \"the missing pizza and wings.\""}
{"text":"I brought the family here for dinner. The Italian baked sub with the \"Z sauce\" was LEGIT!!!! I will definitely come back!  Great food and great service all around."}
{"text":"The sauce on the pizza is really good. Service with a smile, however receiving your order may take longer than normally expected."}
{"text":"Brought the family for the first time. They have allot of food options to choose from. We had a variety of items and all was good. The staff was friendly and the place is clean. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place not only has terrible staff and disgusting pizza but according to their own staff the owners are idiots who don't care!!! We had been getting pizza there several times no problem until we ordered extra sauce on the pizza when we got home both pizza had sauce dumped on top and thrown into a box for convenience please see the accompany photos. when we returned from a 45 roundtrip drive and then back to the restaurant to return the pizza the staff was extremely rude and we were told that their owners wanted them to make the pizza like that and it wouldn't do us any good to complain because the owners don't care anyways and were \" smelly disgusting people anyways!!!\". OMG!!!! I am 50 years old and been eating pizza for the past 45 years this was THE WORST PIZZA EXPERIENCE I ever had!!! Beware in fact stay away!!!! You are warned!!!"}
{"text":"Food: I got a Philly Cheese Steak - It just doesn't live up to expectations, spicy without being flavorful, not particularly full of meat or cheese, not particularly generous in size. 
Customer Service:  acceptable but an \"air of indifference\" strikes you and frankly, nobody working in the place smiled....not the entire time I waited. They don't seem particularly happy to be working there. 
Price / Value: OK but didn't represent good \"value\" for money spent."}
{"text":"Just had yelp call me back after ordering an hour ago. Either Zella's is closed- or they haven't picked up their phone in over a week. 2nd time this has happened with Zella's . Was looking forward to good dinner- guess I'm going elsewhere"}
{"text":"First visit we ordered pizza.  Wife and kids thought it was pretty good.  I'm not a pizza fan.  At least not that type of pizza.  
Second visit I ordered the meatball sandwich, Philly cheesesteak sandwich and a hamburger with cheese.

Meatball sandwich.  Amazing.
Philly Cheesesteak. Meh.
Hamburger was a little bland but good.  

Good service."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The burger is my favorite but I usually come in for lunch because it is nearby and their $4 half toasted sub and fries is perfect.  Not many places you can get lunch and a smile for $4.00 anymore.  Personally, I like to get my sub lightly toasted and easy on the mayo..."}
{"text":"Average at best, the wings are better than the  pizza.  Don't bother with the Extreme Cheese and Pepperoni, it's just a Pepperoni pizza, save the extra few bucks, you'll need it for the delivery charge."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, great baked fries, great service and very good price. This is always my place to go when I need something quick to eat."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were good and service was so so. We ordered a pizza through the delivery service with no cheese, it came to us with cheese on it.  I called them to let them know and all they had to say was \"well you can drive here and show it to us and we can re-make it, but that's all we can do.\" Well when you are entertaining people at your house you can't just leave them to show a pizza to the pizza place that made your order wrong. I understand they have other customers but seriously they are the ones that screwed up, not us. They should have sent someone with a new pizza to check the one we had and switched it out. It was no fault of ours! Other than that it was good. Everyone that didn't have a lactose allergy ate and the one that did have the allergy just skipped eating."}
{"text":"Zella's is a really excellent local spot.  Great quality, low prices & very clean. We have ordered pizzas in which you choose your flavored crust, salads, Chicken bacon ranch baked fries & 12\" slices ($2.50). You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was good with good flavor but it took 25 min to get a pizza sub sandwich. The employees they had working seemed to be training new hires but had no idea what they were doing anyway"}
{"text":"Most Delicious $5  pizza around. Get bacon on it! Wings are great too and the Zella's hot sauce is my fave for dipping crust."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special. Hot sandwich and slices of pizza. All things tasted great and served quickly. The hostess was helpful with great attitude. The prices were low. Will go back"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and orderly the staff is very polite the food came out quick and was hot steak is very tasty the french fries were crispy and the Soda was fresh and had a good mix your hot sandwiches are to die for.  

Update my wife had to drive across town to have another sandwich the next day before leaving town because it was so good we went out to a steakhouse that evening and she really didn't care to have anything because she'd already been satisfied by the sandwich she could not quit talking about the sandwich Enio great place customer service she went in bragging on how good the sandwich was in the owners gave her a coupon for an appetizer great place I go over and over again not only because my wife's going to force me"}
{"text":"Today I ordered a simple double cheeseburger and chicken parm sandwich with fries. Upon completion of the order was given a 45 minute delivery time. The order arrived in 43 minutes, the burger and Zella's Famous Philly were both still hot, and fries were still crisp. What more can I ask for. As for the taste, the burger was excellent, I will order that again. The Philly is like a trip down memory lane to my youth back east. I have found my go-to when I am too lazy to fix dinner, plus they have an excellent 18\" pizza that I have ordered before."}
{"text":"I really love this place. So much I have lunch here five times a week. Great food and awesome customer service! Thank you to the entire crew! Sid"}
{"text":"If you want delivery, get it from UberEats or Postmates.....delivery from them is insanely slow and late, with zero cares."}
{"text":"I love Zella's! They were persistent, taping ads to my door week after week, and I finally caved. The prices are extremely reasonable, and although I've only tried the sandwiches and salads, I can vouch for their tastiness. Zella's is my go-to delivery place. Try the Italian sub; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Ordered an Italian sandwich and pizza fries via GrubHub. Had ordered a few weeks ago had a similar issue. However this night the order was 1 1/2 hours late, which I was OK with because I know businesses can be busy and an order might take a while to get cooked. But when it finally arrived over 2 hours from when we placed our order, it was cold. 

My sandwich had obviously been sitting around, as if the order had been forgotten, and the bread had turned into pudding. 

The pizza fries looked delicious until we ate them and the fries were cold as well. 

Just an over all unfortunate experience. I don't know if maybe it was just busy or the crew working that night weren't feeling it. I am ok with delays, but cold food isn't fun for anyone. 

Based on what I've read on other reviews and my personal experience the issue isn't the food, but the delivery."}
{"text":"Favorites are: Philly cheese stake sub, cajun breadsticks, burger, loaded fries, pizza.  Taste and price keep me coming back.  Great friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I have been picking up to go orders at the Thai place right by this Zellas location for years but, had not ever gone inside Zellas. I'm really glad I finally did. I've gotten both take out and dine in orders as well as delivery. All were great. Some places that serve pizza plus salads plus sandwiches typically seem to have 1 of those good and the rest suck but, here at Zellas I've tried all 3 of those type items and all were yummy! Great customer service too."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. It's near my work, so I come here often for lunch. Friendly staff, delicious food for a great price. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back. Just down the street and everything was fresh with great customer service. Ordered famous Philly with wiz, meatball sandwich, zucchini sticks, and cheese fries. Everything was VERY good, although not the best we have ever had for any of the four items. 


The cheesesteak was just a tad bland and needed a bit more cheese. In addition, the onions weren't so much grilled as they were just heated up...still had a raw crunch/taste. The roll is awesome! The cheese fries were crispy and gooey, even carryout. The zucchini sticks were great, although we prefer coins over strips, since you get more of the actual zucchini flavor that way and less breading (we would get these sticks again). The meatball sub was really tasty, but somewhat tasted like a hamburger instead of meatball. The star of this sandwich was the bread, on which they use a panini press. It was toasted perfectly but a bit fluffy inside and complimented the meat, cheese and sauce without letting any of it leak out. Big enough to split and cut in two, as well."}
{"text":"Not sure about there pizzas and other items but if you are looking for a Cheesesteak sandwich DON'T get it here !!
The end of my roll was stale and hard. I ordered the Mushroom Philly which apparently doesn't have mushrooms and my wife got the Imodium A-D !!!"}
{"text":"Theres some awesome pizza at this place and for a good prices, they even have their own pizza dipping sauce! I work in the same plaza as this place and its the best lunch place around! Take out only takes 15 mins!"}
{"text":"In terms of the $5 pizza world, this pie comes in pretty high on that list. Got the pepperoni and it was ready in like 7 minutes as we dined inside the smallish restaurant. You get that free crust flavor as well and butter garlic always seems to work out fine. The garlic was subtle and the slices were foldable, so that is always a key in my pizza world. The staff was nice and friendly and there are other lunch specials, but this $5 deal is all day long."}
{"text":"Employees seem to be more interested in hanging out and chatting with friends than cleaning up.  Food is overpriced for what you get.  One employee making the food looked like he hadn't washed his hair for a week.  Not the best impression for cleanliness.  Don't know if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Just an update on my post and promised gift cards. I never received any. I was truly considering ordering again once I received promised gift cards, but now this is not going to happen. There are so many other places that care about their customers and are making sure that promises are fulfilled. Not Zella's."}
{"text":"I've only ordered from here a few times but every time was incredible. The service, food, and prices are unmatched. The cheese pepperoni pizza is delicious. Their buffalo chicken fries are INCREDIBLE! Their prices are great and their service area is huge! They were a little late one time and were extremely apologetic. I really appreciate when people acknowledge their mistakes and accept responsibility. It goes a long way in my book. And when they do, they still get a great tip!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and quality food! 

I called ahead to let them know that we were bringing 15 people during lunch. They accommodated us and served us our meals quickly. 

Love their lunch specials! Great portion sizes at reasonable prices. 

They also have a 30 minute pizza challenge! Very fun!

Overall, great atmosphere and awesome food. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak on point, fried mushrooms are some of the best I've had and the pizza is great too!"}
{"text":"I had the mushroom cheese steak and it was good.  The bread could have been better but the meat and toppings were really good.  We also shared the fried mushrooms and they were really good."}
{"text":"Chicken Pesto sandwich was very bland and the Philly cheesesteak was mushy and unappetizing."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich and fries here while barely any business. Waited for about half an hour an yet nothing."}
{"text":"As an employee here we try to focus on how we take care of our customers and deliver the best quality straight to you. Yes we make mistakes but our goal is to fix them with the best possible outcome to ensure our customers want to return instead of walking away. This close knit group of workers we have work hard everyday to make the highest and consistent quality foods we offer. Greeting our customers upon arrival and sending best wishes as they leave the restaurant is how we make them feel welcome every time. Our new management team has been implementing a well strategic system that delivers consistency as well as fast friendly service. Whether you are eating in, picking up, or delivering we try to make every step of the way as flawless as possible."}
{"text":"After craving cheese steak for over a week, we finally gave in and came here to get our fix! This place did not disappoint !! We had the famous Philly and garlic fries!! Both were awesome!!! Definitely hit the spot!!!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place for the $5 pizzas. Well they are now $8. Not worth that price at all. We will no longer be coming here and I'm sure allot of people will stop coming. Its one thing raising the price $1 but more then 1/2 the original price. Bummer this place did this."}
{"text":"We're new to the area and found this place. Bought the Hawaiian and Breadsticks. It was very good and the bacon on the Hawaiian was nice and thick. The price is very good as well. With this place around I don't think I can order from a big chain pizza joint."}
{"text":"Had a lot of pizza delivered today for a party.  I was able to order and pay over the phone yesterday which was very convenient!  Great pizza, excellent price, very friendly service both over the phone and at delivery.  This is the second time we used them for a gathering and will do so again in the future!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and the Baked Fries are especially unique and tasty. I have been coming here for years and they always treat you right. The prices are just fine as well. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is the closest to authentic New York style pizza we have found in Arizona. The crust is great!"}
{"text":"I have ordered a variety of items from Zella's while visiting in the area. From the provolone Philly to the mushroom caps, from the bacon ranch fries and a pressed turkey sandwich to a loaded pepperoni pizza and a deep dish plain cheese, Zella's makes everything fresh and their sauce on the Pizza is among the better out there. The cheese is plentiful and stretchy upon delivery which in itself is generally about 30 minutes. Pricing is reasonable for the quality and portions and the eatery itself is pretty clean should you decide to dine in. If you are looking for a great pizza or sandwich and you want it fast and fresh I would certainly recommend Zella's."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!   -  I wish I could give a NEGATIVE rating !!! I got a flyer in the mail, so I called to place a delivery order. The kid who 1st answered the phone had no idea what he was doing or what the items were on his employers menu. Then he 'dropped' my order on the computer and couldnt read it back to me AFTER he screwed it up 3 times. I asked to speak to the manager. She got on the phone, fixed my order and gave me a subtotal then she added on the DELIVERY FEE of $3.50. told me it would be 45 mins to 1 hr for delivery. And the driver is expecting a tip too!!!
   1-1/2 hours later I'm calling back to ask where my food was ? I told the manager that if my pizza was cold I was sending it back with the driver. 
  Lets review the food: -- Zellas charges $7.50 for a philly sub with cheese whiz. I ordered 2 - I wish I hadn't. They were 2 of the smallest philly subs I have ever seen with little meat. I couldnt believe they were $7.50 each and they were loaded with PEPPER? 
 The $5 pizza was so-so for cardboard, and the $6 greek salad was not worth the price. The steak and cheese toasted sub was good for $7.50 -
  The only redeeming feature was the driver, I explained that I wasnt going to tip because I was charged a delivery fee. The driver understood but I still felt bad. I offered the driver a job working for me instead."}
{"text":"If what Zella's makes is pizza and breadsticks then MacDonalds is a Michelin star restaurant. Pizza has a terrible crust and their breadsticks are more like tortillas than breadsticks. 
Based on what I received I will never try Zella's again. Pizza Hut is better. And Pizza Hut has never made anything that resembles a real pizza in its life.
The person on the phone was anything but cordial and welcoming. If this were my company, I would fire him immediatley. 
Zella's will not be around for long, unless they get help from Restaurant Impossible. Based on reading other reviews, Zella's is either very inconsistant or perhaps some buyers are not aware of what good pizza should be."}
{"text":"1st time eating here. We ordered the cheese & pepperoni pizza, breadsticks, fried pickles, meatball sub and Zella's Philly Cheesesteak. Everything was very fresh and delicious. They said it would arrive at 5:20p and the delivery was at the door at exactly 5:20p, on the dot. Very good service and food!!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and have not been disappointed yet. The pizza is fresh and hot and offers a taste of Italy at a great price. You get more than bargained for when ordering the special 1 topping $5 dollar pizza. A thousand times better than little caesars!!! 

Even though I am giving this place rave reviews it's not capable of being at the five star level. However it is at the TOP of the four star pizza game! 

So happy to have this place near our home!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza I've found yet in the valley! And really reasonable. The wings are good too but you can't go wrong with that gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"You cant buy a slice of pizza, only full pies when you dine in. The atmosphere is riddled with blaring lights (bring your sunglasses) making eating in a very unpleasant experience. The pizza is OK."}
{"text":"Where do I start...... After placing an order on Grub Hub at 7:30pm and getting a confirmation email that our meal would arrive an hour later, our food never arrived on time! Called Zella's and asked where our food was and the girl had no freaking clue. After finding our order and not offering any kind of discount at first and had to ask for one since this wasnt out fault they couldnt find our order(Which was half off). Pizza finally showed up 2hrs after offically placing the order and it was a complete disaster, pizza was messed up in the box and cold and everything else we ordered was cold, which doesnt make sense when we live less than 3 miles away and was told it would right out the door after it was made for our trouble. Pizza was ok, nothing to write home about and just really couldnt enjoy it. Food should have really been free and this place must be struggling because it seems like we flyers every week on our door step for this place and thought we would try it but wont be going back to this place anymore! Hope this place doesnt last because thats not how you run a business."}
{"text":"Tried through grub hub. Order was late, pizza was unpleasant to the eyes and mouth. We got it and it was folded over itself. The pizza tasted like cardboard, identical to the stuff I ate back in high school. Not awful but I would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizza is good, the fries are delicious and great customer service! Also great prices!! I crave this place often."}
{"text":"For an inexpensive, quick meal, it's not a bad spot. Their cashier/server was over the top friendly and very energetic. (Not in a bad way but surprising)

The foot long pizza slice was huge and decent. The buffalo chicken was mostly crunchy batter, that I wouldn't order again. 

My husband had a philly with provolone. Also said it was good, not great. Too much bread to meat ration. He did say it was good enough that he would come back to try something else. 

I wouldn't crave the food but I wouldn't be hesitant to be to stop by for a quick inexpensive bite to eat."}
{"text":"Customer service was less to be desired! Staff was filled with rude and impatient teenagers. Food is overpriced and the descriptions are somewhat off. Ordered a sub and recieved a flatbread sandwich. Better off at Subway, a lot more food for the same price."}
{"text":"I've been here once - and that was enough. Sorry, but this place is not worth your time just based on customer service and hygiene.  Back when it opened I went there. It was empty except for one guy at one of the small tables in the front.  I stood looking at the menu, waiting - while two young girls sat chatting in the kitchen. There is a big opening, so I could see them and they could see me waiting.  After almost 5 min, one girl finally came up to help me. She wasn't overly nice or rude, just meh.

I ordered a pizza and asked how long it might be to be ready. I'm on a short lunch break so it matters. She said just a few minutes. 

She then proceeded to go back around the corner towards the kitchen, only she stopped to chit chat again with the other girl for a full 5 min before she even made my pizza. I was standing there watching the whole time. Not only that, but she touched my cash and then didn't wear gloves or anything to touch the toppings for my pizza. Ewwww!  

I called the girl up and told her I was not able to wait, please refund my money and cancel my order. I left with the intention to never return. Don't think this new place will last past a year, if that."}
{"text":"The series is terrible and the dining room is filthy, and the Manger was rude and looked like she hadn't washed her clothes in weeks. I couldn't eat in anything prepared in such a dirty environment."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and great customer service. Cheesesteaks are OK but good for the price. Got the really big pizza for the whole family."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 large pizzas and boneless wings combo.  Pizza lacked flavor and the toppings were minimal.  Maybe a half step above a Dominos pizza but definitely nothing special in my opinion.  Wings were ok but they were served dry with no bbq sauce as we had ordered."}
{"text":"Why the great reviews? OMG this place is terrible. I ordered a chicken parm sub and got chopped and breaded mystery \"meat\" swimming in sugary red sauce with rotten tasting cheese on top. The bread was stale. 

I also got a salad that had fermenting lettuce in it. Horrible. And the iced tea-lemonade tasted moldy and off. 

Everyone who reviewed this place must be a family member. There's no other explanation."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick slice for lunch. Only $2.50 and the slice was huge. Made to order so it was fresh and hot. Plenty of toppings (I got sausage and mushroom). I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a 24-inch pizza which was the biggest pizza I think I've ever encountered for me and other people. I personally didn't care for it, though. My delivery was 30 minutes late, first off, which wasn't a huge problem. But the pizza was very greasy.. It was too much for me. After I ate two slices, it made my stomach feel very bad that night and part of the next day. I'm not sure if I'll ever order from there again."}
{"text":"just so you know.....ive had 14 pies from this joint and cannot complain.... some of the best ive had in 12yrs out here....they have all all been purchased before 350pm....js."}
{"text":"We tried Zellas  for the first time tonight. My family thought it was pretty good. We had 2 Philly steak sandwiches and a pepperoni pizza. I though the prices were great. Salads are 5 to 6, sandwiches either cold or Philly steak are about 7. Other reviews mentioned the bright lights, and yes it's bright in there, but the lights are LED...they are going to be brighter than normal lights.  I liked being able to see my food as opposed to sitting in poor lighting. Don't look directly at the lights and you'll be just fine. My family decided it was good enough for a second trip. I think I'll try the cranberry pecan salad next time. Oh, and someone else mentioned how dirty the place was, and I didn't think so. I didn't go in the bathrooms,  but the dining area was clean, I had no complaints.  When we went to get our soda, the dr pepper was all out and as soon as we mentioned it to a worker they fixed it. No complaints there. I thought the staff was wonderful and very nice."}
{"text":"Zella's was a great business to work with. We hosted a free flag football camp, and they did not hesitate to offer up free pizzas. Great pizza and awesome management. Highly recommend. Look forward to doing business in the future."}
{"text":"The pizzas we ordered were just flavourless..... and they charge 3.50 dollars for delivery!!! Tat is on top of d minimum 15 dollars for delivery!!! I would never ever go back here or order from here again."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and one that was generating a lot of traffic from their mid-week mailer when we walked in. Zella's is sort of a pizza hybrid, a cross between a Barro's, Isa's and Little Caesar's.

First, this place is cheap like Little Caesar's. Advertising a $5 one topping pizza is certainly a good deal. And despite the obvious 'upsale week' sign on the back freezer offering a $20 Chipotle gift card to the highest grossing employee, you can tell there is a definite culture of upselling built into their model. So much for the $5.

Second, we chose to go with the NY style pizza, which was a bit larger, a bit thinner and a bit of a stretch to consider it NY style, but again, it's okay. I thought the crust and cheese to be very similar to Barro's- and for the approximately the same price.

Lastly, this is no Isa's... If you're looking for real NY style- across the street is your place. But with real NY come real NY prices, so it's probably a preference thing. Real plus expensive? Isa's. Hungry plus cheap? Zella's. Tried and true favorite? Barro's.

I wish these guys luck- you can never have too much pizza!"}
{"text":"Had a Cheese Steak awesome! Haley has good service and was very polite."}
{"text":"5 star food and 5 star service. I've been going there a year and half now and never once had a bad mean. Service is top notch too. I've been very happy with this place and I would strongly recommend this place. There lunch special is awesome too."}
{"text":"Average. Pizza was ok, we had three different wings and they were just ok, sort of dry. Just not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Very impressed! We ordered delivery and the pizza was fresh and NOT greasy!!! What a pleasant surprise! Breadsticks were delish and salad was crisp! We will definitely order again! Best delivery pizza in a very long time!!!!!"}
{"text":"Impressed! Inexpensive, tasty, greasy goodness!!
Great service too!
I
 had the ultimate pepperoni with garlic crust"}
{"text":"Hands down the best \"5\" dollar pizza out there! I loved everything from the sauce and cheese (which was the perfect amount) to the flavored crust they offer. 

The pizza deserves 5 stars but I had to give 4 stars because they charged 75 cents for a little container of ranch. Definitely not worth that and I need my ranch with my pizza so... If they can either lower the price of ranch or make the containers a little bigger, they easily get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Only visited this place one time but I must say that I really like the cheese steak and fries. Price was right and everything was good. Maybe next  time i will try some pizza or something"}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Placed a $80.00 order online. Missing a sandwich and they refused to replace or give a credit. Blamed the delivery service. Defitnely never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Little Ceasars is so gross. The pizzas sit there waiting in a heater for someone to order them. When I got my flyer in the mail I pretty much assumed it would be like a little Ceasars knock off. I was wrong. When I walked in I was greeted by a warm hello, the menu was explained to me and I decided to test out this $5 1 topping pizza. I was surprised to hear it would be a ten minute wait. Whaaaat? You are cooking these to order??? That's a good sign. The ranch is great ( yes i have to have it)and it was great pizza for $5."}
{"text":"If you want a cheap pizza this is the place to go...waaaayyyyyy better than little Caesars"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends the other week, and we weren't super impressed. Here's just a mini run-down of our experience:
1. The service was phenomenal. In fact, I'd give Zella's 5-stars for the service alone. One of my gentleman friends is very picky and gets upset easily, but the cashier handled him like a pro as my other friend and I died from embarassment (we don't get out with him much- this was an exception). 
2. Food is okay. It's your basic, cheap and easy pizza joint. Nothing seems to be home-made. But the garlic knots are delicious. Our pizza was a little too heavy with grease, and the wings had a bitter after taste to them. My salad was decent, although I am not a fan of only light crunchy iceberg lettuce in the mix. I know, I am a bit picky, but this is my own personal opinion.
3. Price was good. Cheap for sure.
4. My friend and I got food poisoning later. It could be completely unrelated to our visit but who knows. This was the only \"abnormal\" place we ate at that day aside from our usual go-to restaurants. It was not a pleasant experience.

Overall, I won't be returning just because there are other food joints I enjoy more. I see a lot of people really like Zella's and I did enjoy the service, but the food quality for me isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The service is outstanding. The food is so tasty. We had the buffalo chicken french fries and the garlic chicken sandwich. They were both mouthwatering. We have been ordering pizza from them now instead of all the other places we used to. It's definitely the best. ! I recommend this place to anyone! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very tasty, fair pricing and a nice clean restaurant. I want to come back in and try one of their hot sandwiches or Philly cheese steaks."}
{"text":"Love the food here, horrible costumer service. Called to place a delivery and the worker who talked to me on the phone was so rude to me I ended up canceling my order and going else where. I've been here many many times and I won't be going back ever."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza tonight and received it almost 3 hours late. We were never told that they were running so far behind, something they should have mentioned when we ordered. Or each time we called. . instead of being lied to and told their delivery man was 10 minutes away. Every time. Finally received our order and the delivery guy handed us the order and barely said thanks. No apology. And..the pizza was barely warm. Horrible service. Mediocre food. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I always pick up a large pizza with their flavored crust with my coworkers. They have a pretty good lunch menu. Good food and great prices."}
{"text":"Awesome service, pizza great value at $5, with free flavored crusts, incredible sandwiches made fresh and they use real Cheese Whiz on their philly's.  Fried pickles different but really good too."}
{"text":"As the name says:  pizza and cheesesteak sandwiches.  Unique Philly sandwiches, plus the classic Philly. Also burgers and wings.

It was cool they had several variations of the Philly (not a fan of Cheez Whiz, which is the traditional).  The sandwiches were very good.  If you were going to Subway why not come here instead?  Seemed fresher, tastier, and you can even get fries if you want them!

Didn't have a pizza, so I can't speak to that.

Good find.  Probably not as good as Emilie & Carlo's in Chandler, but a lot closer to my house.  I think you will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are so friendly! The pizza is good and so inexpensive. I ordered two large pepperonis and had the crust flavored (for free mind you!) and it was less than half of what we usually spend elsewhere! They put just the right amount of sauce on the pizza in my opinion and when it was delivered to me it was still HOT! The delivery man was so sweet and full of smiles. They called me when my pizza was in route to my home. I don't know of a single pizza place that has the courtesy to do that! Zella's is top notch!!!"}
{"text":"Cars in the shop, so discovering local cheap delivery joints. 

First off, I have to subtract stars for charging $3.50 \"delivery fee\" That money should be the tip that goes to the driver, and is just a dishonorable way of sneaking extra cash into the bill.

The food.., xl=18\" w 3 toppings and parm bread sticks (pizza crust with parm cheese on it,)
For $15 w/coupon it was what I expected, although the people seem nice, delivery fast, modest amount of cheese on the pizza, reasonable everything else except one of my toppings was onions and I can tell you that was a waste!  Which is stupid, its the cheapest topping I requested! load it up a little, sheesh.
The second time we ordered I asked if I could pay a buck and get some cheese on the cheese sticks, they said sure and while it didn't make it good, it made it better.

I respect them trying to service at a low price point, and yes, I've had worse, it's delivered fast fresh and friendly, which means a lot.

But that delivery charge (which I know was started by a chain) is just so maddening, and an insult to the drivers."}
{"text":"The one and only time we ordered from this place it was pretty disappointing. We had a simple order- a cheesesteak and a giant pepperoni pizza. We made a simple request that they leave the pepperoni off of a small area of the pizza for a family member that doesn't eat meat. This simple request turned into a pain. First the girl said no they couldn't do that... When I asked why not she put me on hold for several mins to ask the manager. Really?? After having to explain this simple request a few more times they finally said ok.. The delivery took WAAAY longer than quoted and by that time the pizza was cold and hard. It was bland and the pepperoni was sparse. It reminded me of little ceasars $5 pizzas only cold with less toppings. Also, the Philly cheesesteak was a joke. It was about 4 inches long with some dried up meat and almost nonexistent cheese on stale bread.... I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Overall very good and very clean,  they have an awesome lunch special,  a pizza challenge as well,  we will be back"}
{"text":"People need to realize this is not gourmet pizza.  It is a great $5 pizza place that is way better than a Little Ceaser / Hungry Howie's type place.  I also LOVE their brownies!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Quick service and self seating.I especially love all of their subs. Deli subs,baked subs and cheesesteaks... The hot vinegar is addictive!"}
{"text":"Long day and didn't want to make dinner so stopped in for some takeout. Ordered a cheesesteak, Philly fries and hot wings. The wings had good flavor and were cooked very crispy which I like but I don't think most people will.  The Philly fries were good but the portion size was a bit small for the price. The cheesesteak was good and I was told by some friends that real Phillies have the WIZ (cheesewiz) which this one did. The size of the sandwich was a bit small for the price but not too offensively small.

Overall the experience was ok, not the best but good. Since they recently opened I am not too critical and will go back in a few weeks to try the pizza."}
{"text":"A great place to come for just a slice or a whole pizza!!! Always fast and friendly service!!!!! Food is delicious too!!!! Thank you Tessa for helping us celebrate my daughter running for student council!! :)"}
{"text":"I placed an order a week in advance for four pizzas to be delivered to my daughter's classroom for their end-of-the-year party. I was very specific with directions and I even paid a tip ahead of time. The day of the party I called 20 minutes in advance of the pizza to be delivered and checked on it and they claimed I never paid and I'd have to pay again and it took them 8 Minutes! Of them scratching their heads to retrieve my receipt. They were late on delivery and even though I told them a second time where to drop off and was very specific, they still got lost and I had to go outside the school building and wave my arms to get their attention. Not the best customer service I have had but their pizza was just fine."}
{"text":"Ok, as a Philly boy I gotta say, this is #2 best cheesesteak I've had in Phoenix. The bread is AWESOME. I walked in and ordered a chez wit, but the employees were confused. Anyone that has had a real Philly cheesesteak will know what this is. I explained how I wanted it. They were glad to accommodate me. When home I dug in to the cheese whiz greasy cheesesteak and loved it, except the huge cuts of peppers. The pizza was the best I've had. Butter cheese crust, MMMMMMMM. I live in central Phoenix but will return. Staff was awesome and fun. Thanks guys. See you soon again. Would love to meet owners and chat about cheesesteaks"}
{"text":"Do not order anything but the speciality pizzas! It's cheap delivery so it's worth it but I ordered cheese fries and got stale non seasoned fries with American cheese melted on it, gross."}
{"text":"3.5
This place was better then I thought it would be. The kids and I shared a 14 inch pie. We opted for the butter garlic crust and it was decent. 

The pizza dough was good, sauce, cheese and meat were all a little sparse but the flavor were good....and it was $6 bucks for 3 of us to eat. 

The girls next to me had some sandwhiches and they looked good too."}
{"text":"**UPDATED REVIEW**
The pizza is still fine but it is insane how long the wait is and how little the workers know about customer service! The employees yet again knew little-to-nothing about the menu and it was so obvious that they would rather be anywhere but working. Ordering a slice of pizza to go has a wait time of 20 minutes. The only reason why I occasionally go back is because their pizza is decent!"}
{"text":"Hate to dish on a place after one visit but I was hoping for so much more.  Was jonesing a cheese steak and saw their signs so I stopped in.  I hate take out so we decided to eat there.  Mistake #1.  The place is pretty boring but at least it could be clean.  We were there 45 minutes and a table sat with dirty baskets, trash and half eaten food the entire time we were there.  At least 3 employees walked by it and didn't pick it up.  Tables could at least be wiped down occasionally.  Guy taking order could have had more personality especially for a first time visitor.  Had to pry info out of him.  Food was average at best.  Breadsticks were very good.  Cheese steak was a let down.  Cheesesteak was small, meat was average but not hot and they skimped on the cheese and toppings.  It took them at least 20 minutes to get a relatively simple order out to us.  While we sat there we got to listen to the staff yell at each other in the back.  Not angry just loud but did hear one obscenity which just isn't acceptable.  Can only hope they step back and take a little more pride in what they are doing.  Maybe take out or delivery is the way to go here for cheap pizza.  They did seem to be doing a lot of delivery business."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good for the price you pay! Very tasty and they have awesome lunch deals as well. I would recommend this place any day . The Staff was on point too."}
{"text":"First time, last time.

First time ordering from here and it will be the last time.  I ordered 1 large pizza and a 2-liter bottle of coke.  Was told it would take 45 mins for delivery.  Ok.  I called at 5:51 on a Thursday.  Pizza did not get delivered until 7:14.  AN  HOUR AND 23 MINUTES LATER!  Called to get the status on it at 6:59.  Told he left 5 minutes ago and he should be here any minute.  15 minutes later he arrived.  I live less that a quarter mile away.  

Got the pizza and of course it was cold.  On top of that, I wasn't impressed by the taste of it.  Domino's is better.  Never again will I get food from this place again."}
{"text":"Went here the other night to check them out, I keep receiving coupons from them and everyone on FB keeps tagging them, so I thought why not? Although we didn't use a coupon since it was a last minute decision.
Went into this location and all I could think of was holy bright! The lighting was so bright I thought I was walking into the sun! Lol, but then my eyes adjusted, the place is fairly clean and well maintained! We ordered a pizza, cheese steak and zucchini fries, for to go. We waited for a good 25 to 30 minutes, but that expected for a pizza..
Then we drove home[ 5 minutes away literally], we opened up the zucchini fries, barely warm, but freaking delicious, I love that they were decently thick cuts of zucchini with a nice layer of crunchy batter. 
The cheese steak was delicious as well, although I could have gone with a little more cheese whiz over it, and it was cold, so I had to heat it back up. 
My bf dug into the pizza before I did, and once again it was cold!? Then on top of it, he said the pizza smelled a little fishy, it was weird, but I couldn't smell it. He ate a slice then finished my cheese steak and didn't want the rest of the pizza because it just didn't taste or smell right to him. I ate a slice of pizza on the opposite end of where he grabbed his, it tasted fine to me, but this morning I went to grab a slice to eat on the same side my boyfriend grabbed his slice from, and he was right, not only did it smell fishy for some odd reason, I could taste it too, but it seemed like it was either coming from the crust [ we got ranch seasoning] or it was the mushrooms... it was a weird almost sardine like taste and smell.. do they have sardines or anchovies?!? Either way I ended up throwing out the rest of the pizza, sucks that we had a bad experience with the pizza, but we both loved the cheese steak and their zucchini fries, so we'd definitely come back for those! Maybe, just maybe we will give their pizza another shot as well since my first slice tasted pretty good!"}
{"text":"This is based on the pizza. It's really good a fresh. I did however ask for a cheesesteak but instead I got a cheesesteak pizza. That's ok, so my order was wrong. Luckily the pizza was good! Maybe the girl behind the counter did not hear me correctly. I also got the garlic fries. Well they were disgusting  They had some sort of garlic creamy sauce on them. It looked like garlic ranch dressing fries. Never again! I would return for the pizza tho. Oh and I'm still confused about the clean boxes on the floor at the counter???? What's up with that!"}
{"text":"Quick delivery on a Friday night. The pizzas arrived hot, the salad arrived fresh and chilled. The pizza crust is great - not too thick and it has great chew. Not a greasy pizza, nor is it over-cheesed. Just the right amount of toppings. My new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful staff. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and salad lunch special for 4$. It was delicious and a great value."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here last night because Texas Roadhouse was super crowded, I am glad we did. We both ordered toasted subs, I had a Meatball while she ordered the Italian.
Both were very delicious. The Pizzas looked great and we are planning on trying those next time. The only complaint would be that it is super bright inside, Maybe tone down the lights a little."}
{"text":"I tried ordering a Pizza from Zellas and it was such a painful experience I gave up. I had to repeat my order and address 4 times!  It sounds like from the other reviews Zellas has a problem with their customer service. I hope the owner checks these reviews and does something about the poor customer service. There are tons of pizza places out there you truly need to shine if you expect your business to make it."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Zella's fan! Besides the fact that the food is incredibly delicious (I have actually tried almost everything on their menu)... the customer service is top notch! The pizza, with flavored crust and fresh toppings, is over the top. The sandwiches are toasted to melted cheesy perfection. And the baked fries... the fries may in fact be my favorite thing to get! As far as the staff... they go above and beyond to be friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The most impressive thing about the Zella's staff is their commitment to their community. They work together to do amazing things for deserving families throughout the year. I say again, Top Notch! If you haven't checked it out... do it, today!"}
{"text":"Been in the restaurant buisiness for 27 years. No complaints. Excellent customer service, friendly staff and great food for a low price."}
{"text":"Lemme say, you gotta try the Philly Fries. Blew. Me. Away. Great place to go to and not like your typical chain restaurants that surround the area. Defiantly worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"I ate in the restaurant and the food was ready within five minutes.  It came hot and fresh.  In fact the French fries were so hot we had to wait to eat them..  Had a Philly Cheesesteak and the meat was tender and delicious with just the right amount of cheese.  Fries were crispy and properly salted.  Not five stars because out of ketchup at the counter and the person took a while to take our order.  Restaurant is warm if you eat in, turn on the air."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Everything was meh. Too bad there's not better pizza options out this way."}
{"text":"Its an upscale little ceasars with more variety and better quality pizza. IMO, its the best 18 inch 1 topping for the money. 10 bucks 4 a pretty good 18 inch NY style 1 topping. the same size pizza anywhere else would be more than 10 bucks and maybe if not probably close to 15 dollars if not more so for 10 bucks for an 18 inch decent quality that's close 2 a New York style one topping pizza for the quality I would say it was really good."}
{"text":"The first one (pizza) wasn't too bad a year ago, then in December I ordered a $5 \"special\" large and couldn't believe how sparse it was.  I thought Little Caesar's was bad.  Save your money."}
{"text":"I am a connoisseur of cheesesteaks. I rarely get a decent one outside of Philadelphia, however I often try. Of Zella's... I will say - Bravo. Well done. 

A true Philly cheesesteak is not made with sliced prime rib. It is not made with American cheese. And it's not served on an artisan roll. It's made with steakum style meat, cheeze wiz (it's called a \"wit\" as in wit cheese), and served on a good soft roll. It's soggy, drippy, messy, and delicious. And Zella's did this very well. In fact one of the best cheesesteaks outside Philly I've ever had. If you want a fillet minion and American cheese steak sandwich, more power to you. Just don't call it a cheesesteak. 

Obviously - the owners know what a good cheesesteak is. Love it as much as I do. And have done their best to bring it to the people of Arizona. And you've done a great job. Congrats because this is a major major MAJOR compliment coming from me.....  And while it's not the best cheesesteak I've ever had in my life, I'm still giving it 5 stars (probably would be 4 stars if I were in Pennsylvania) because I didn't expect anything even close to this in Arizona."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience.  It took two and a half hours for the pizza to be delivered after three phone calls.  The pizza was cold and tasteless.  The wings were the wrong ones and also cold.  HORRIBLE!!!!  I will not be ordering from them again.

{"text":"We're from out of town and were looking for a delivery place close to my MIL's since we didn't really want to go out.  Decided on Zella's and so glad we did!  We received our delivery in a timely fashion...40 mins to be exact!  I had the hot Italian sub and it was very good.  The hubs and a kid had the chicken bacon ranch fries and they were really good!  The other kiddo had the burger and it was also good.  Two patties and good sized.  We ordered the garlic breadsticks too and they were delicious.  Very garlicky but we didn't mind.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the food really is good.  Will go here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger. I thought I would check this place out 
I actually purchased a gyro sandwich. This sandwich was the bomb! I thoroughly enjoyed my choice. 
They do deliver so we will be checking out options for delivery."}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch here for awhile now, and I love everything on the menu but my favorite is the chicken bacon ranch fries, I am truly addicted to these fries. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. Great place to bring the family for some great food."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and wings!   Thin crust is our favorite.  

They deliver to the Bella Via neighborhood as well.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Yes, their food is good, but their customer service (more specifically, that of the owner, Jason) is THE WORST EVER! If only Yelp allowed you to rate with zero stars...

I came in today to pick up a corporate lunch order using a $25 Restauraunts.com coupon. The order was called in ahead of time, and the restaurant was told that we were using this coupon. When I arrived, the store manager said that he \"heard I was coming,\" that he had called his owner and was told they no longer accept Restaurant.com coupons. 

Why didn't they call and let us know before we drove over in 105 degree heat? I'm not sure. 

When the coupon was denied, I pointed out that the document had a DOES NOT EXPIRE exemption. I also pointed out that the lunch was for a department within a 450-person company... located right down the street, uses them for special events and whose employees are frequent lunch customers (case in point: there were three company employees in a booth at this same time).

The manager relayed this detail to Jason, and he STILL would not honor the coupon. Told me that it was my responsibility to call Restaurants.com to validate the code -- even though the coupon said it was THEIR responsibility. So I called. Sat on hold for 10 minutes with no answer, in a HOT restaurant (did I mention it must have been 85 degrees in there?) In the meantime, I had to push back a meeting because of the delay that this restaurant caused.

Finally, after multiple calls to the owner and our verifying the code, the store manager made an \"executive\" decision and accepted the discount.

BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a restaurant owner that appreciates your business and respects the value of your time, you won't find it here. 

If you're looking for a case study in how NOT to run a business, this one's a winner."}
{"text":"We have Mixed feelings about Zellas on Power Rd.....Sometimes they're on point where the food and service and timing seems well organized and managed. And then other times they're the complete opposite! It's never bad enough that we will discontinue ordering from here but they need to try and be consistent. We love their Pizza."}
{"text":"I had our pizza delivered. It came early by 30 minutes! The pizza was a little soggy in the center. I let it sit for a while, it was one of the best I've had in a long time. When placing the order, by phone, the person taking the order seemed confused but got the order right. I'm going to try Zella's again for sure."}
{"text":"Tonight was the 2nd time we ordered from Zella's. Both times we had it delivered first thing we noticed was it was hot like just out of the oven hot even though it was delivered. We ordered a full famous steak Philly and a half. It was amazing both times! We also ordered the buffalo chicken fries which are very very good! Tonight I also ordered a cheese pizza for my toddler son. He loved it. I thought it was good for a $6 pizza. We are definitely loving that they deliver to us too!"}
{"text":"We love Zella's pizza but more importantly their pickle spears, oh myyyyy...so delicious. Pizzas and everything else on the menu is reasonably priced. For pick-up they usually tell you 15-20 minutes but I've come to find out it's more 25-30 minutes. Great for when you're in a pinch or have a large group you are buying for."}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza (added garlic crust) and a cheese steak.  The cheese steak was excellent.  I ordered the one with cheese whiz (which is how a cheese steak should be).  Good bread, tasty meat, cheese and onions.  The cheese steak is a solid 4 stars.  

I would rate this Pizza a 3, but for $5, it is the best pizza anywhere.  If you want the best pizza, go to Grimaldis.  This is the kind of pizza place you would bring kids to.  It is far better than Peter Piper.  I am a Pizza nut and almost didn't stop here because i saw $5 pizza on the window.  The yelp reviews looked good, so I went in.  The pizza quality is as good as a dominos or Pizza Hut.  I saw people eating a bunch of cheesy fries that looked really good.  They also have wings which I would like to try.  I will go back to try the fries and wings.  I think the restaurant is worth trying."}
{"text":"Been here a few time now. Their pizza slices a HUGE and worth the by-the-slice option. The one down side is that the housekeeping is always a bit slow. Tables are often full of crumbs and the booth chairs have to be wipped off by the customer (me)."}
{"text":"Delivery and to-go take forever here! And don't even try to use a coupon, they never accept them. This is too bad because I love the steak fries and my husband loves their meatball subs. Pizza is just okay."}
{"text":"Ordered $50 worth of pizza at 7pm with a 8:20-8:30 delivery window and order arrived at 9:20. I called to find out where it was and wasn't even offered an apology. 

Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Kitchen stuff does not wear hair nets. They use their bare hands hair and make and prepare your food. I asked for them to cut my sandwich because they only cut mine partially through. I broke a plastic knife trying to cut my sandwich. And they grabbed the sandwich with their bare hand and cut it in front of me."}
{"text":"I called in my order at 11:25 am and was told it would take 25 minutes. I arrived at the store at 11:50 and the employee looked at the pick up orders to check for my name and told me my order was still in the oven and thst they are super busy today. So i said ok no worries. I sat and waited until 12:05 and was stressing because i had to be at work by 12:15. I stared at the pick up orders and there was no new ones. I had a feeling my order was sitting there the whole time. I was about to cancel my order so i walk up and another employee asked what the name of my order was and sure enough it was the order that was already sitting there when i arrived! I could not believe it. I don't get how the other employee did not see my name on that order but the other employee 15 minutes later did?!? Please read your pick up orders carefully. You wasted my time and stressed me out before work. This order was for my students and with the lack of the amount of plates there was i now have to make sure they eat carefully with napkins."}
{"text":"We make a point to try new restaurants all the time.  Based on the reviews I thought this place sounded good.  It was average.  My Greek salad was half frozen.  My husband's cheesesteak was dry with too much bread.  Their specialty Buffalo style fries were good.  The service was fast and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"I just got the $5 cheese pizza. For a $5 pizza it was good. They use a lot of rosemary which I like."}
{"text":"We love this new hot spot.  Great deal on pizza for me and the kids. Clean and nice inside ."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza, breadstix, and baked fries at 8. It was supposed to be here around 8:50. I called at 9:15 and was told it was on its way, I live less then 5 minutes away. After waiting an additional 15 minutes I called back they called the delivery driver and he said I was his next stop.  30 minutes later still no pizza. At this point its been two hours since I placed my order and I still do not have my food. I have ordered from this place before but after this I Dont think I'll be returning. When I complained the guy on the phone could just say sorry and since I ordered from eats street app I would have to contact them to get my money back. I tried calling them back after not receiving my food another 30 minutes of waiting and now there was no answer. I have never experienced this kind of service in my life. Horrible!!! Now I have to fight for my money back because I used the app that their website processed the order through."}
{"text":"Great large pizza for less than $6 and free drink and fries for military, love this place."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the woman that delivered our pizza was very friendly. 
We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms, cheese fries, wings, and a Philly cheese sub. The pizza tasted like cardboard and lacked cheese. They overtopped the pizza with the mushrooms, which made me feel like I was eating cardboard and mushrooms. 
  The Philly cheese steak had decent bread, but that's about it. They didn't put enough meat or peppers. 
   The cheese fries tasted like they put a lunch slice of Kraft cheese, stuck them in the microwave, and over nuked them. They were soggy and tasted really weird. 
   The mild wings were okay. Probably the best thing in our meal, but still just okay. I think a papa johns probably has better wings. 
    Overall everything tasted like was from a can and microwaved. While some may say I should of looked at the prices, I feel some places are good with reasonable prices. Maybe if I was 8 years younger and drunk with a bunch of friends, I would of liked this place."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast so might be a bit biased but only thought the cheesesteak was ok(bland and barely any cheese). I might come back to try the pizza but I don't think I would get another cheesesteak. My wife the her cheesesteak was good(from AZ)"}
{"text":"Place is VERY bright at night.  When I said bright, I felt like I was sitting inside the tanning bed lol.  Place is clean and simple looking.  Food is okay, nothing special.  We ordered meat ball sub, (meat balls were smashed and ground beef looking), pepperoni sub, (tasted like hot pockets), steak and cheese sub (smothered with way too much cheese) and pepperoni pizza, (average flavor).  

One thing I hated about our experience during our visit. Food was taking too long.  Compared to other pizza joints, which is much busier than this place serves up food faster.  

Other than that, if you want cheap, and average Italian food. This is the place for you.  As for me, not going back."}
{"text":"Was very excited to eat here...
Ordered a philly cheese steak...added peppers & mushrooms, the young lady didn't mention that it would be a $2 charge to do so but hey if it's worth it I don't mind, it was definitely not worth it! The bread seemed old, not toasted/warm & fresh...I couldn't even see or taste the mushrooms I paid an extra $1 for. So I politely told them that I didn't think they added them so they offered to get me some...a different girl comes back saying she talked to the cook & they said they added them but they cook down a lot so we open the sandwich again & dug thru the meat to find a tiny one. I told her it's kinda unbelievable that they charged a extra $1 for something you could barely see...@ that point it seemed like they were trying to defend themselves by saying they were in there instead of offering to bring more even after she saw that there were barely any visible & that I was unhappy...my husband then told her his sandwich was kinda dry & asked her for au jus or more Chez whiz, she said we had to pay for more cheese. lol so he gave her a $20 for the extra $1 something for a tiny ramekin of cold chezwhiz...when she comes back with the change I then now also show her one of the over cooked boneless wings, the whole nugget he bit into was a rubbery chunk of the most disgusting flabby things I've ever seen, you couldn't even pull it apart-did not even look like chicken just all rubbery gristle & maybe mushy breading? He couldn't eat it...She says \"wow that's pretty gross\" & apologizes...then asks if there is anything else she can take off the table for us. Really?! I nicely told her we were very unhappy & would probably not return again. I'm a server @ a VERY popular Italian restaurant so I know if someone is unhappy I get a manager involved. No one offered to make us new wings or offer a refund of any kind. We did our best to finish what we could but in the end kinda gave up in disappointment...she ended up giving me a free sub coupon but for me that felt like the least they could do...We left it on the table. so we spent $50 & had to go home & cook my son something else cuz he was still hungry! In the restaurant I work @ $50 would not only full you up happy but you almost always go home with 2 days of leftovers! We always comp or fix all the food they were unhappy with &/or definitely at least offer something else! & always show a manger messed up food! The zucchini sticks were pretty good but would definitely not return or recommend this place to anyone...oh & the $1 juice boxes are really half the size of a normal juice box, I didn't know they made them that small. Just felt like we were nickel & dimed in every way possible! In the end, I did tip when I placed the order...I am still a server & know it was not the young kids fault that were all very polite to us...think management could've handled it better & the quality of the food we ordered was not worth $50...very disappointed."}
{"text":"A one-star review, not because of the pizza itself-a five dollar pizza is a five dollar pizza-but for the low level of customer service. The final straw for me was being charged incorrectly for my order, asking for it to be corrected and having the employee fail, asking for the manager to sort it out and watching the manager fail-and doing so with an attitude that conveyed how little he could care about the whole thing. No thanks."}
{"text":"I don't consider Little Caesars edible. Zella's is 5 dollar pizza. It's edible. Again, it's 5 dollars. What were you expecting?"}
{"text":"Food is awesome at this place. Absolutely love the Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich. The manager on duty had a weird name but did a great job. Sinjin made sure we got exactly what we wanted."}
{"text":"The store is new and relatively clean, and the employees are nice, but that's really all I have to say that's good about this place. We lived in Philadelphia for two years and since coming back west we are always on the hunt for a good cheesesteak... and apparently we are still on the hunt :( The prices are a total rip off for the serving size you get... the cheesesteaks should be at least a few inches longer and the $3 fries were equivalent to size of $1.50 fries at a fast food joint. Plus, we had to wait nearly 20 minutes for our food when there were only 2 other people in the restaurant. By the time we got our food, we were looking forward to a great meal! 
Unfortunately, we will not be coming here for our cheesesteak cravings again. They have a lot of different options but the cheesesteaks aren't very good. It tasted like the meat, onions, and peppers were all in separate warmers all day and thrown together for dinner. Totally not authentic! We got a side of fries with Cajun seasoning, which were decent, but nothing special. Maybe their pizza is better, but I definitely wouldn't come here for cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Uber Eats has totally changed my mind on this place! In my previous review I said that I wish that the food sucked, so I wouldn't be tempted to ever eat there again. The service was consistently disappointing and slow. We ordered through uber tonight and it was fast (33 min!!) and delicious. That cheesesteak pizza rocked our worlds and the kids loved their cheese pizza. So glad to have this so close by!"}
{"text":"Just got a order of wings and steak fries delivered. When I ordered the steak fries I said no peppers or mushrooms. \"Sir no mushrooms come on the steak fries\" oh ok then, can you just add jalepenos as well. \"Sure\" order came on time in about 30 minutes. Opened the steak Fries to mushrooms..... The wings I ordered hot/bbq no sauce.. Those two things costed about 14 bucks and he said minimum is 15$ oh ok so just add a drink on there as well. Ok your total is 20.58 a drink is 5$????? Never the less I tipped him 20% on top of that because my father always taught me to tip! Couple tips for Zella's. train your staff so they know what's on the menu, and first impression is everything!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place for a cheap dinner. The pizza is amazing and better than most places. The staff is so friendly and easy to talk with. I love how clean this location is and their speed of service. Zella's will be my number one go to for pizza"}
{"text":"I love the Oven Baked subs here! Try lunch specials on their Hidden Menu for $3.99 I got the sub plus fries! Ryan pointed out the hidden menu and I wouldn't have known if it wasn't for him!!  

And pizza is always amazing"}
{"text":"We ordered two 24\" pizzas (not a typo) for our group of 10 and were more than satisfied. One pepperoni and one Italian Sausage.  

Great New York style pizza. GIANT slices.

Delivered efficiently by a very pleasant Grub Hub driver."}
{"text":"i have to give a 3*. food was great which is half the stars and being able to read a ticket  and follow instructions is the other halfish."}
{"text":"food is decent but the wait time for two slices of pizza is obscene. they need to keep some basic slices pre-made during lunch at least, because the food is not so great to be worth a 20 minute wait. menu is varied but I feel like they might be overextending themselves at the expense of the quality of service."}
{"text":"The customer service AND food at this place is AMAZING!!! We first came in here three days ago we were taken care of so well and the food was so delicious that we couldn't wait to come back! Tess took care of us the first time & made a great impression. There's a young lady working this morning who may not know that she is equally as awesome. Shoutouts to the kitchen staff for doing what they do so well. Zella's we sure are glad we found you and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I always order the mushroom philly with extra onions and mozzarella cheese. Every time they have never let me down!! I am from Boston Massachusetts so I'm very picky with my philly cheesesteaks. No one in the valley has them beat on their cheesesteaks!!

The staff is incredibly friendly and very helpful they have not gotten my order wrong one time!!!

The only thing I will add though is they need to add more parking in that area."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the 5 dollar pizzas. So good and better than little Cesar's. Also had the wings and Greek fries which were fantastic."}
{"text":"First time here. Came with 3 co-workers and everyone including me loved the food. Fraser salads, chicken bacon ranch, and a Philly cheesesteak all got great reviews. Friendly staff and great location."}
{"text":"Wings are pretty good, got the honey hot boneless wings. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich it was the pepper version and i omitted the mayo and the jalapenos and could not eat the sandwich because there was enough salt on it to cover for the whole week. Beware getting a sandwich unless you eat it there...."}
{"text":"Picked up a pizza and baked fries for take out and it was amazing!!!! I would recommend this place hands down. I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I ever ordered from them. And I must say it was very tasty. The only thing I didn't like was the high delivery fee. But I will definitely order from them again. Our weekly pizza night."}
{"text":"If you are looking to meet the most perky girl in the world stop here for lunch!  Tasty food & good lunch specials.  4 TVs and all on different channels, it's like they know I don't care about English pre-teen water polo!"}
{"text":"Ordered some wings and a Meatza pizza tonight. An hour and a half later, I still hadn't received my order, so I called the restaurant. After a few minutes, I ended up speaking with the manager, who was extremely apologetic and told me that they'd immediately make and delivery the order, and throw in a free two-liter of soda. I couldn't stay mad at them- the manager was genuinely apologetic and really wanted to make the situation right.

The order came, and not only did they throw in a free two-liter, they also threw in two cheesecakes. I figured \"That was nice, but let's see what's up with this food...\". Ya know what, it was genuinely REALLY good! We got the suicide garlic wings, and they had some *KICK* to them. A really nice flavor, and the sauce was genuinely spicy (which is kind of rare...). And the pizza... the pizza was actually GREAT. I think they sprinkled a bit more oregano, or something, but there was a little somethin' somethin' special on that pie. It was damned tasty!!!!

All in all, it was a really good experience. I'll be ordering from them again, and if the next few meals are as good as this one was, then I'll be bumping them up to five stars easily!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, karli was fantastic and patient while we asked about everything.  Ihad the oven baked italian sub, my husband the provolone philly cheese steak sandwich.  The bread on the sub was so good!!! We enjoyed both sandwiches and the place is clean and cool!! Will be returning for sure"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Is it cheap, yes, which is really nice, is it fast, yes which is also very nice especially for lunch breaks during the work week. The staff is always very nice and the place is spacious and clean. Onto the food, the pizza is general, nothing special, but decent. Their subs are pretty tasty, but very greasy. Their specialty fries sound delicious, but are very soggy and greasy. They also serve appetizers, wings, salads, cheese steaks and other side items. I haven't had any of those but I am sure they are general like the rest of the food. I don't want to give up on them yet, so I am going to give their chesses steaks a try next time! 5 star for service, 2 star for food, so I will have to go with an average of 3 stars for the review. I think if they kick things up a notch with the basic food taste and cut back on the grease they would have more mmmmm to offer!"}
{"text":"Very clean, cashier friendly and awesome. Food was great and inexpensive. Very impressed with this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and deliciously hot suicide/insane wings! The sandwiches are good as well. Great customer service! We have ordered several times and once our order was incomplete but they fixed the issue promptly. We will order from them again for sure. Zucchini sticks are tasty when they arrive crispy and fresh!"}
{"text":"Went during lunch on a Friday afternoon. $5 large pizza, I can't lie I was a skeptic. I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza is actually decent quality and so much better than the \"other guys\" $5 pizza. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was very delicious and the service was great. I got their $5 pizza (which like every place has now) and buffalo chicken fries. The pizza was good and the garlic crust was an added benefit. The fries were on another level of delicious. I loved it. From the small chunks of buffalo chicken to the melted cheese, everything was great. I'm glad I found this gem."}
{"text":"Big fan of the buffalo chicken pizza! Cannot wait to try some of the baked fries... Speedy delivery and the best pizza I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan. The pizza taste (not much flavor) like cardboard,  the wings were soggy with no sauce, and the food was cold upon delivery.  They might be cheap, but you get what you pay for. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Just ok. I ordered light sauce, extra cheese and half pepperoni and got the opposite of all of that. :-( derive is ok but kinda slow. Just eh...  don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"Their pizza is downright delicious. I've ordered take out from this location so many times, and they always arrive on time, or 5 mins earlier than expected. But watch out for the Greek fries.. a tad bit greasy and not really great"}
{"text":"Tonight my friends and I chose to eat at Zella's and we were not disappointed at all. It took us 10 minutes to order for all of us and Dylan gave us the best customer service we could've asked for. He was patient and even made sure everything was correct. While eating we were watching Dylan and he is just an awesome worker. Most of us have management positions in food service and we almost wanted to recruit him haha. He stayed busy and always set what he was doing down when a customer walked in. He greeted everyone and whenever someone left he made sure to say goodbye. He answered our questions and was extremely helpful. Good job Dylan!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. You can't get a better thin crust type pizza ...especially for $5.00!!! Sauce is very flavorful. Employee Tessa is a rock star! So nice, so enthusiastic, and always a smile on her face. Jason has found a diamond in her! If I had a business I would want her working for me!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This place was horrible the cheap prices reflect the quality of the food. Attached is a picture of what they considered chicken wings which were burnt, and little to no meat on the wings. When we called for a deep dish pizza they said they just ran out and no longer have any, the pizza had little to no cheese on t to where you saw straight sauce on parts of the pizza. I wouldn't recommend this place at all! Don't waste your time of money."}
{"text":"Went to Zella's today for the first time for lunch. I was very impressed. They were fairly busy with almost every seat taken at one point but service was great. The gal up front with no name tag on was incredible. She almost single handed took care of running the register and taking orders while checking on tables, taking food and plates to customers, clearing trash, and answering questions. She did more work with a smile on her face than I have seen multiple workers do at other establishments. 

Pizza was good. Came out quickly and was fresh. We got the $5 special with ham and ate the entire thing there. Mom wants to go back and try the zucchini fries. 

Last but not least, the bathroom was clean!! Always a good sign."}
{"text":"Holy moly, I order from you all the time but the girls answering the phone clearly don't know what is going on. I always get the wrong order but today the cashier is convinced that someone with my name \"Ephrem\" and with the same order just walked in before me and took my order... Not professional and very sad, get your ordering right so we can come back otherwise there are other 7$ pizzas around here."}
{"text":"Wow! That was a fun sandwich. The pizza cheese steak. My boy and I enjoyed it a lot. Parking is a little nuts in there, but lots of good food choices overall."}
{"text":"I was surprised by all the hate this place is getting. My boyfriend has gotten their carry-out pizzas a couple of times and last night we ordered delivery.  I like their pizza better than the pizza from the major national chains!  Order the garlic-flavored crust: it's awesome.  I like their zucchini sticks, too.  The service is good and the staff is friendly. Our pizza was delivered in about 30 minutes. I think some of the negative reviews might just reflect growing pains since the restaurant is new.  I'm glad Zella's is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Favorite delivery place.  Zucchini sticks are top notch. Delivery is a bit slow, so order early. Service is friendly. We had 1 issue in all the times we've ordered and they fixed the problem right away, no hassle!"}
{"text":"They've made a couple of mistakes on my delivery orders, BUT they redeem themselves with great customer service. I was given manager credit and my next order was perfect. I love the variety they offer and I think I've enjoyed everything I've tried. The red sauce on the pizza is just okay though. Get the Hawaiian pizza with BBQ sauce. DROOL!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's great food and totally affordable. The pizza is great and super cheap and has a cool atmosphere to eat at. It's kind of like your local neighborhood pizza joint. 

If you come here, u gotta grab some bread sticks, they are literally the best I've had. 

Reason for the 4 stars is that im kind of impartial to Grimaldis and Barros , my two favs

Everyone's super friendly and I'm a big fan, check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was good,but don't order delivery through Yelp.Order was skipped over. Manager gave us 20% off our order, but it took 2 hours to get our food."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week for lunch.  Always friendly, food is good, and the price is fair."}
{"text":"Shopping at the Dollar Tree, and Goodwill can make us pretty hungry!!

We walked in, and having never been there before, we were greeted by a friendly young lady, who answered our questions, never showing any impatience, and recommended, or at least told us, which crusts were the most popular.

We went with a cheese with tomato (one item), and garlic crust - and it was good.  They told us the wait would be 10 minutes, and it was 10 minutes.  We had ordered it as a \"take-out\".  The crust was really garlic-y, and we enjoyed the pizza a lot.  The cheese was not greasy.  We will be back!  It is definitely better than Little Caesar's.  

I would also be up for trying one of their sandwiches.  They looked pretty good, as a man near us, had ordered one, to eat there.

UPDATE:  Placed another order:  Tomato pizza w/garlic crust, and ham pizza with ranch crust.  My husband said the ranch was really good.

The pizza tastes even better the 2nd day..  :)

It is our go-to place for pizza.  We have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Got pizza from there today for the first time really good. They have $5 large with one topping not bad beats Lil Caesars. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This pizza is disgusting!!! It is super oily and tastes like cardboard. I would take Little Caesars over this pizza any day."}
{"text":"Pizza is completely forgettable, but have had two subs there that were really good. I've had one bad experience with the service, and two good ones. The pizza is still pizza (hard to make pizza so bad you can't eat it) and you do get a big pie for a price that can't be beat, so there's that."}
{"text":"Haven't gotten the food yet. It has taken this place almost two hours to make two sandwiches and drive them to my apartment that's a mile down the street from the shop. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Thought they had good food. Just lack of customer service. They have alot of kids working there and the girl at the cash register just had a terrible attitude acted like she didn't care to be there. It was totally obvious in her actions. I think they need more adults working there"}
{"text":"Yum! We had a short break in ball games while at Big League Dreams. This place is right down the street. We didn't have a whole lot of time so I ordered online through the Yelp app and we went down there and our food was almost prepared. My son ate his cheesesteak on the way back and started to dig into his Greek fries and he LOVED them. We also saw they have one topping $5.00 pizzas every day! My son was drooling over the pizzas on the way out. We will definitely be trying that special soon!"}
{"text":"Good service and above average bargain pizza. The philli cheese steak was quite good.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed a wide arrange of food, delivery and otherwise in my life. I also consider myself a fair person. Those things being said this was the worst delivery experience of my life. 
Most egregiously the food came destroyed and cold; the pizza was crumpled and the chicken was encrusted with what I can only describe as \"yellow goo\". Some of the toppings were so fine and limited that they were almost a mystery as to what they were.  The crust was soggy and tasteless. The sandwiches were wet (which is not a texture normally associated with a sub) and bland. The girl who took our order wrote our address down wrong so of course the food was late. What makes that more insulting however is that the delivery driver called us multiple times to correct his course and get the address straight, and he just didn't get it. (To be fair, he was nice enough.)
We live in one of the largest and most well established apartment complexes in Gilbert and we still had to leave and walk across the complex to fetch our food. Our estimated wait time was 45 minutes, perfectly reasonable for a Saturday night right? Well by the end of this horrifying debacle, which was supposed to be a birthday surprise from my boyfriend, it took an hour-and-a-half and honestly, even setting that as the standard the food was still lousy. Run far away from this place."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place ever! Great pizza, great crust. We eat here about once a week and the Pizzas always fast and fresh.
I recommend Zellas to everyone I know and my Girl Scout troop loves it too!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food! Stopped in after a flight to Mesa and was not disappointed. Motivated server/hostess made us feel extremely welcome. Fast service. The pizza and wings were delicious."}
{"text":"I was really excited to find a place close to me that had Philly in its name. I'm from New Jersey and was missing the cheesesteaks. I went on their website and ordered 2 Phillis and 10 wings. The total came to $28.70. They got delivered and noticed how small of a bag they came in. Once I opened the bag and found two 4 inch subs, I was really upset. I called the store and was put on the phone with the manager. She explained that ordering online charges $1.50 extra and swore the subs were 6 inches. Regardless of what size, I thought I was getting a 12 inch for paying nearly $30 for 3 items. The wings were good but the subs had little meat and was far from being a philly sub."}
{"text":"We received a \"jumbled\" pie from their delivery department today. See the photo. Ya it was cheap. But my wife was afraid to eat the pizza with concerns about it actually spilling out on the ground. Papa Johns did a better job."}
{"text":"Ya know, it's not Philly, it's not even a New Jersey steak, but it's not steak-umms and the rolls, while not Amarosa rolls, are soft and tasty. The pizza is about the same, it's nothing to write home about, has a decent crust and the sauce I thought was pretty good. I liked that they had some of the favorite cheesesteak varieties from the East Coast. I'll go back for a steak wit fix."}
{"text":"Best $5 pizza in town,  hands down,  wings are good but not worth the $8 for 10, service is friendly,  but can be slow at times.  Still my favorite cheap pizza place,  better then Pappas John's,  Pizza Hut etc."}
{"text":"Being from Philly I had to try a cheesesteak here. Sorry boys. Looked good at first with a roll that wasn't too bad.  But there was some kind of \"funny\" taste to the meat. Kind of a sour smell. Enough criticism. Not a real Philly cheesesteak. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Very consistent! The service is always great. Only had one experience less than satisfactory, the rest met and exceeded the usual standards of service you expect from the rest. They go above and beyond, a simple phone call if the driver is running a bit behind is the way it should be and a standard they set. They get more than a passing grade from me."}
{"text":"Not good pizza arrived in 1 hr and half and pizza all over box. Definitely not again for this basic food.."}
{"text":"We love this place and the food is always fresh and delicious. Great specials and the delivery is fast.  The gyro is really good and not messy like some other places I have been. A+"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome owners!!!  I have always been treated phenomenally whenever we have ordered food from here."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. We waited over 20 minutes to get it on a Tuesday evening which it didn't seem to be very busy. The restaurant seemed to be warmer than normal, AC was but cooling as I would have expected. Seemed like there was one girl running the register and one guy in the kitchen.  May go back for a second chance, but won't be the first choice."}
{"text":"Don't take their \"star rating\" too seriously. Really. Dig deeper. Look at the recent bad reviews. Look at the drubbing they've gotten on GrubHub reviews. If you want food that is served within a reasonable time and at the right temperature, go next door to the other similar place in the same strip of restaurants there.

Terrible experience. We paid $50 for a meal delivery which was not delivered for 2.5 hours after the order was placed through Grubhub. If you look at the Grubhub reviews of Zella's, you'll see a trend and it will validate everything I'm saying.

We ordered the meal at 5:35pm. The estimated delivery was 6:40pm, which is expected on a Friday night. 

7pm rolls around. Nothing. That's OK. It's Friday. But the kids are getting impatient for dinner. Then 7:15pm. Then 7:30pm. 

At 7:35pm, TWO HOURS after I placed the order, I called Zella's to find out where our order was they didn't seem to have a record of it although I paid through Grubhub and had an order number. Put me on hold and came back and said they had a \"system crash\" and they'll prepare my order next and get it out to us. 

25 minutes later, a Zella's delivery person shows up and delivers our order. Our family is extremely hungry at this point. We're now at about 2.5 hours from original order.

We ordered three sandwiches and two orders of cheese fries. There was not one piece of the order that wasn't lukewarm or just plain cold. We had to microwave all of the sandwiches, and then toast the cheese fries. The cheese fries were just plain cold. Microwaving them hot didn't do any favors for the taste. What does this tell any sensible person? That Zella's lied to us. Cold food usually means that it has been sitting awhile. My guess is that they didn't rush to prepare our food after we called. It had been sitting there getting cold for who knows how many hours.

That now added almost another 20 minutes to our experience before we could eat. Nothing like ordering delivery just to find yourself warming up what appears to be cold leftovers. If you're scoring at home, we didn't sit down to eat until almost THREE HOURS after order time.

I'm a fairly understanding guy and stuff happens, but Zella's crapped the bed on almost every aspect of this order. What I'm pissed about is we spent $50 between GrubHub fees, tips, and the food. $50 for three cold sandwiches and cold fries. We could of had a really nice meal out for that much, and got our (hot) food 2.75 hours earlier.

I think that is my last experience with both Zella's. As you'll see from their GrubHub reviews, they continue to get feedback like this and they don't make an effort to improve. I'm not one for freebies, but based on what was going on, I kind of expected them to throw something our way. Most restaurants of higher caliber probably would have comped the meal. There was no make-goods. This is also consistent with their reviews on GrubHub. There are too many restaurants not only in the area with similar menu offerings as Zella's, but within 50 yards of them. My guess is based on their continued indifference and other's reviews on Grubhub, they won't be around too much longer. GrubHub Order 1378780509"}
{"text":"Was in the area recently with the family and we had a taste for some pizza.  Our family loved this place.  The staff was super friendly, the place was clean, and our food came out quickly.  Their pizza was delicious (we had bacon topping and garlic crust) and was only $6.  It did not taste like a $6 pizza.  We also split a toasted sub that we quite enjoyed.  We will be back.  Oh yeah, get one of their giant rice crispy treats.  It was awesome."}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service and serious lack of competent management! 

Two weeks ago we walked into this location and ordered a pizza and a sub sandwich. The cashier told me that it would take approximately 15 minutes for the pizza and offered us water cups for the wait. After a 45 minute wait I went back up to the counter to see what was taking so very long... The woman making the pizzas looked very flustered and now there was a guy standing behind the register wearing one of the dirtiest  shirts I have ever seen before in my 45 years!  I asked him how much longer my wait was going to be, he checked the tickets and said it should be coming out shortly.  20 minutes later our order was ready and we proceeded home to eat.  We sat down at the table and realized that the pizza wasn't even the one we ordered. I called the location and explained what happened and the manager told me that they would remake us a pizza if I wanted to come back up to the store. By this time we had already waited an hour while at the store, drove 15 minutes home and I really didn't want to wait any long to eat our dinner.  The manager understood and simply said \"next time you come in dinner is on us\". 

Today two weeks later we returned to this store to have dinner. I mentioned to the cashier that we were promised a free pizza for their mess up last time.  He looked puzzled like I was speaking French or something. He walked back to the manager that was working and had him come up front. This manager told me that he didn't k ow how to enter a free pizza unless I knew the other managers name that I spoke with. I asked him if they may have written my name down somewhere or how they kept track of these types of issues... He responded that he didn't know and he didn't really know what to tell me other than he couldn't do anything without the other managers name in a snobby condescending way! 

I was upset with the whole experience and even more upset that I was promised to be taken care of and got nothing but attitude from the employees.  I asked to speak to the general manager or their contact info. The manager told me that they don't have one. I asked for a corporate number and was told they don't have one. I asked for him to call the owner and he said that he is unavailable and he would not call them. By now I am completely blown away with the lack of customer service and the amount of disrespect that is dished out of this restaurant.  

With this type of attitude, customer service and lack of direction from upper management this place is a sinking ship!  

I highly recommend staying away and spending your hard earned money somewhere that it's appreciated!"}
{"text":"Pretty great $5 deal for pizzas. they give you free fries and a drink if you're a vet."}
{"text":"First time ordering through DoorDash. We decided to try Zella's after seeing a review from a fellow yelper. 

I ordered the Famous Philly for my husband, I got the Italian and I also ordered garlic fries to share. My husband loved his philly and it was a huge portion. My Italian sandwich was so good, enough for two meals. The bread was delicious! The only disappointment was the garlic fries. The flavor was great but it was soggy. They may want to rethink the container, maybe something that has vents? 

Besides the fries, our food came quick and I was able to track it through DoorDash and even got text messages to update me. Our dasher was friendly and food was here before expected time. We'll definitely order again!!"}
{"text":"10 minutes for one slice of pizza with no one in front of us. My two-year-old was screaming pizza for a good 5 minutes and I had to ask someone to go see if it might be done. Surprise! It was. We won't be back. 
The deep dish slice is more like a French bread Lean Cuisine pizza. This is not pizza!!"}
{"text":"Last night, I placed an order for delivery(upon recommendation from my daughter) and paid nearly $50 for my order only to be disappointed by 1) cold pizza and 2) the wrong pizza. When I called and spoke to a manager, she offered me 50% off my next order. I told her given the quality of pizza I received, that there wouldn't be another order and that her offer wasn't satisfactory. She then reluctantly offered to refund me for the amount of the wrong pizza I received."}
{"text":"Ok so I've actually been ordering from here for quite some time since one of my best clients lives in the area and it's fantastic! I've never actually had the pizza because I'm a French Fry connoisseur and they have many many varieties aaannnddd different kinds of Breadsticks. My favorite fries are the Greek Fries but the Buffalo Fries are also awesome!! Cajun Breadsticks are definitely the way to go for breadsticks.  I also just finished an Italian Sub and it was amazing, the bread was absolutely perfect, not as chewy as Jimmy John's and not as soft as Subway. Online Delivery is a breeze from their own site, there is a fee and a minimum but it's the best way to order IMO. It will tell you that it'll arrive in 45 minutes but it's always about an hour which isn't a big deal if you know beforehand. You can also pick up which is what I did first and found the place rather clean even though busy, all the staff I've talked to have been super friendly and helpful.  I highly recommends."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the whole pizza but the New York slices look great and I can vouch for the cheesesteaks which are fantastic.  The pepper cheesesteak is awesome.

Consistency is a bit of an issue -- I ordrered the same thing twice in 24 hours and it came with fries once and without once.  The bread seemed different as well (but was good both times).  Even the content seemed different, but good both times."}
{"text":"ordered for my twin brother in the area, the process was easy and comfortable.  The pizza was good, atleast that's the word that my Twin brother gave on it.  Good joint.  Great customer service over the phone!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Great employees. Can't complain. Always a pleasant experience on my frequent visits. I recommend buffalo chicken fries. My opinion, it's one of the better options but they also have great subs too."}
{"text":"Extremely sub par. Me and a friend of mine were deeply disappointed again with the quality of pizza. The crust was okay. The cheese and sauce was quite bland. However the ranch and blue cheese was excellent. The wings were decent, but nothing to cry home about. The service was not genuine, seemed forced and awkward. I wouldn't pick this place, but if brought their again id eat it."}
{"text":"The pizza and subs are so good! I've been looking for a good cheesesteak and I think I found it! Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Pretty weak cheesesteak. The fries were crispy and decent but how can you \"specialize in phillies\" and serve this up? It was fine and sort of big but lacking in flavor for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about a fast resolution. Not only did the owner, Jason, reach out to me immediately-- he even sat down with me to discuss what happened. He wanted to make sure he had all the facts so that he make this a learning experience for his team, and it really came down to the computer defaulting to my home address. Jason was personable, apologetic, and personally, seeing a business go to the length of sitting down with a customer to ensure the incident doesn't repeat itself is remarkable. 

Jason also told me it was even more upsetting that this happened to a non-profit, and told me some heartwarming stories of families his company has helped. Jason definitely earned my business back! 

P.S. Tessa (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong), you rock."}
{"text":"These idiots can't get a order right to save their life! On more than one occasion I have called in my order and swine we live close I pick it up, tonight for the second time they said my order didn't exist and I must have called a different Zellas, can't be cause I order from this one everything it's the only number in my phone for Zellas and it has worked before matter a fact once I give Eddie my number he tells me my name!"}
{"text":"Yeah I will definitely not be eating here again. The cashier had ear buds in and didn't even welcome me upon entering.

 I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with wings and it came out to be $24? The philly was defintely not worth the price, it was greasy and lacked flavor. The ranch was watery, as if it was left out for sometime. The wings were alright. But even the sauce lacked depth. 

  And didn't even say bye or thank you for coming as I left."}
