{"text":"FOOD: both Korean and Japanese food are offered, so there is a lot of selection! The menu is even reversible -- Japanese on one side, Korean on the other -- so I had quite a bit of trouble picking something on my first visits. I've tried their sushi, sashimi, bento boxes and a few classic Korean dishes. I think their Korean food is generally better. I especially recommend the Pork Bone Soup (the soup base used is unlike any other I've tried). 

SERVICE: fairly slow considering how empty the restaurant usually is, but since it's just the wife and husband (both extremely nice) doing everything, I've learned to accept it. I've also learned to call ahead with my order, so it's nearly ready when I arrive. 

COST: low/mid-range in terms of price for a casual restaurant. An average dinner is about $10-$15. They do have lunch and dinner specials which are really great value. 

OVERALL: A nice little family owned Korean/Japanese restaurant. I've been many times for dinner when I just didn't feel like cooking. My only complaint would be their music choice -- anything from classical, to Christmas music (at all times of the year). There's free parking either in front of the restaurant or on nearby side streets. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great food, quality service and speed.  Very hospitality driven.  When I have to wait for my order they often serve me some soup or tea while I wait.  Lovely people!"}
{"text":"When we moved to Long Branch, I frantically started researching all local Japanese/Korean restaurants for THE ONE where we, as a family can go to regularly.  This place is 2 min drive from us, which is a huge plus! 
I read the previous reviews about owners not being nice and disappointing decor but I don't care about that at all, I want good food, that's all I care about, I can usually win the grumpiest person in the room :)

So! The owners were actually very nice, the service was personable and attentive BUT the food really needed work, it wasn't as fresh or as flavourful as it should have been. The prices are pretty low, great option for students.
I would like to one day give this place another chance, I really like the sweet elderly couple who own this restaurant, maybe in a few months."}
{"text":"We came here last night in hopes in finding some hidden gems since moving to the west end.  We ordered a couple of dishes and were mildly impressed:

1. Sushi app - smaller portions and they only had salmon and a white fish.  Not bad but it wasn't great.

2. Babimbop - rice and veg were pretty good, but definitely lacking beef that we ordered.

3. Spicy chicken - tasted great but lots of batter vs actual meat.

The service was a little slow and the restaurant temp was pretty hot."}
