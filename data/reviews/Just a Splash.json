{"text":"Acting on the advice of the bellhop we took the kids to this poolside restaurant. 

I'm assuming the prices are in line with the rest of the restaurants on the resort but 45$ for my young girls to split a burger (3:5) me to have a good but ordinary black bean burger (3/5) and my fianc√©e to have a tuna sandwich was a bit steep. 

The was nothing wrong with the food but I expected more quantity for the money. Although my girls, who are moderately picky eaters are their entire portion. 

On the plus side they were fairly quick and they did split the burger for us which was a nice customer service touch."}
{"text":"This place is consistent, awesome poolside/bar food plus +++.  Delicious quesadillas; kids' meals are no joke; salsa/guacamole to die for.  Service is fantastic.  Also, try some of the AMAZING concoctions that keep adults HAPPY!"}
{"text":"Just a Splash is the pool bar of the JW Marriott Desert Ridge. I didn't try any food but had quite a few drinks as I relaxed by the pool. The Pina Colada is great here, but comes at the hotel resort pricing. The milkshake is also good and the bartenders were able to add a shot or two of vodka to it for us. Staff are great about distributing pitchers of water and overall friendliness. Definitely one of the better pool bars I've experienced."}
