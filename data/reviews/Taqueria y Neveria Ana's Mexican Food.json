{"text":"This is a small place but well worth your time.  This is a very basic diner with limited seating  just plain dealings, nothing fancy...  just great food and service. The food is absolutely amazing and costs less than most fast food dives. It is one of the best quality fresh meals around!  I can't stop with the Chicken Gorditas, Carne Asada Burritos and my next trip anijitos.  This is a local establishment that has the best customer service around of almost anywhere.  Everyone is friendly, the staff and the customers.  Don't let the location steer you away, it is very safe with a lot of hard working people all around. This is a high recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place ever! The tortas are bomb! Specifically the tortas cubana and regular tortas. Also MangoType raspado is yummy"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic tacos with flavor in the meat and salsas! This is the place!  I have NEVER had a more flavorful taco! They have other items too, like Burritos and tortas. I am sure they are just as good!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem has been my go to for tacos for a little over a year. The owner and her kids have always been courteous and friendly. Sad to see that this place has closed down. Hopefully it will reopen in the near future."}
