{"text":"The atmosphere is very trendy and comfortable. Great decor with exposed brick and nice details like a high shelf running just below the ceiling with various knick knacks displayed on it. A large mirror leaning against the wall behind the bar expands the space and lends a hip touch to the place.

The draft beer list is well laid out. It accommodates tastes ranging from Blanche de Chambly to Tankhouse and the wine list has a similar wide range. 

Now sadly the burgers is where this place fails to deliver, the overall thrust of the place. The burger was good but I must say I classify it as underwhelming for what I expected. The meat wasn't very flavorful and the toppings just seemed to overpower it completely. There really isn't much to say about the burgers simply because they're not awful but they're certainly not great. A very straight forward, boring hamburger that you can get at many places but usually with fries and usually under $15

Sadly disappointing place that misses with it's main intention but delivers on the setting and beverages... Now what's with the burgers?!"}
{"text":"The prices are the only thing that make me give this 3 stars. Thankfully I didn't get a burger and didn't deal with the cost of adding fries so I didn't deal directly with the most costly elements of this place.

I got poutine with BBQ sauce and pulled pork and it was fantastic and much more economically priced at $8-9 (I can't remember which, ha). It was a huge portion and all the ingredients tasted fresh and the gravy was steaming. I would definitely recommend a poutine as the cheap option here."}
{"text":"I came here once, and I never came back. The burger I had was average and overpriced, and I ended up feeling really sick that evening and the day after. I'm not sure if it was related, but based on the experience I'm not compelled to go back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with some friends, ordered the pulled pork sandwich, definitely recommend it was super tasty and the coleslaw had a nice tang. 
I was the only one who got fries and honestly they were some of the best fries I've had in T.O. 

The bread on the BLT wasn't toasted enough and it was like white wonder bread style. A more unique bread would make it seem like it's more of a specialty sandwich instead of looking like something you can make at home.
The addition of chipotle mayo however made up for it!

My friend reported too many beans (even chickpeas were included) on the sloppy joe, more meat was expected, and the bun again was a white wonder bready bun.

Service was a little sloppy but friendly. 

Good food for the most part, mediocre bread!"}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I have been to BQM, and I think my last. I had a great experience when they opened up. Then I went to the Spadina and Queen location, and the burger was bitter. The third time was unmemorable, and last night just confirmed it for me. I'm not going back there unless I'm really desperate for a burger. Fries were limp, an doily, and burger was OK. What really topped it off was the waitress, who asked us what was wrong because we looked \"down\" and then told us to smile. WTF? I wanted to tell her why we were unhappy: soggy fries, and the fact that every Beach House song they played was on repeat.

After 4 visits of varying quality, it seems they really need to work on consistency."}
{"text":"I've been here several times (once because the line up at Pizzeria Libretto was insanely long) and I'm not as impressed as I'd like to be.

As previous reviewers have mentioned, its pricey.  The burgers are ok - served medium well unless otherwise requested.  A little dry at times.  The sliders are a little on the dry side - I would have liked them to be served with some toppings (lettuce, tomato, etc.).  The buns are ok - you can tell they are fresh.  But it lacks substance.

I've had the poutine, sweet potato fries and onion rings.  The onion rings are more like \"onion steaks\".   The sweet potato fries were decent.  The poutine gravy was lacking in flavor and sadly, they do not use curds.

So would I go there again?  Maybe, but to try more non-burger options."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so once in a long while I will order a burger here...Unfortunately they lack a consistency and quality control. I concur with many that they go through the effort to have naturally raised beef but fail on  the quality of buns...if you take out, your bun will usually be soggy by the time you eat it... Another sore point is I recently ordered late at night and took a side of sweet potato fries...which were for the most part over cooked salted bits and pieces..I nibbled a few and put the rest out for the local Raccoon...he seemed to like them however.. Anyway there is obviously not a manager over seeing quality.."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is right by where I work and one day I was craving a pulled pork sandwich.  Mistake.  Pulled pork was dry with little to no bbq sauce.  The coleslaw was dry also.  They put cheese curds on it as well, which isn't my fave to begin with.  The onion ring on it was a nice touch.  The space is great and has a nice vibe when you walk in, but $12 for a dry pulled pork with no sides included... I'm not going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Best burgers I've had in Toronto. We've had good burgers other places but BQM (specifically Osssington) is consistently good and theres something about their salty mayo aioli flavors that taste amazing with their fries, sweet potato fries and burgers. Whenever we think burgers we rather just pass on most and wait til we're able to get to BQM.
We've had the Hawaiian Burger, the Ossington, Riverside and more all sirloin. We are huge bleu cheese fans so I'm not sure why we haven't gotten around to trying that one. Their burger is probably the reason we stopped being veg and healthy in general, before this the only burger we really ate was the BBQ Burger from Fresh which is still AWESOME and huge (and not particularly healthy, inexpensive or anything so at this point I'd choose bqm over it)"}
{"text":"Harumph. I really wanted to love BQM. I love the idea - their meat is from Ontario farmers (the menu has a little map with cute stars marking the locations of the farms) and I love to support local food. They're also close to home. And I love me a good burger!

But, as so many others have said, BQM was disappointing. I spent a lazy afternoon here, basking in the sunshine (finally!) with a couple of friends. The patio is in full direct sun for most of the afternoon but it looked like they were measuring for an awning while we were here, so perhaps the future holds some relieving shade. 

Our server was sweet, but not good. Service rates as just barely adequate. 

Beer selection is pretty good, if a bit pricey. They have a daily beer special (Sapporo was on for 5$) and if you can stomach whatever's on special, that'll work out well for you. They also have a few local-ish brews on draft and an interesting selection of bottles (though nothing you can't find up the street at the small LCBO, so I'd be reluctant to pay for them here). 

But the food... The food was the real disappointment. The burger itself was good. It wasn't amazing. It was just good. And for $11, with no sides, I'd hope for an amazing burger. We also ordered a large side of sweet potato fries ($5) to share (between three of us). Those weren't good. They were soggy and the serving was just wee. 

And the presentation was weird (Yes. The presentation. That is what I'm going to gripe about). They served the burger all by itself on a large white plate, with not so much as a sprig of parsley to distract you from the fact that fully half the plate was completely empty. The empty space on the plate just seemed to emphasize the fact that you're paying $11 for Just A Burger.  It's like the presentation was designed to taunt me. Weird. 

Maybe they were having an off day, but I wasn't impressed. I'd go back to have a pint on the patio, but I wouldn't go back for food. There are too many other good options nearby to give them another shot at that."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a buddy for an impromptu lunch. He is a huge fan of the place but I was popping my BQM cherry.

Mind you my review can only apply to their vegetarian burger options, but his bacon accessorized meaty version looked and smelled glorious (yes, I made him let me smell it). Also, they ask you how you want your burger done (rare, medium, well done) which is pretty rad.

There are 2 vegetarian options; a tofu burger and a chickpea burger. I picked the chickpea burger based on the waitress' recommendation. I was good albeit mushy... I was hoping for something that resembled more of a burger patty.

Price wise it isn't the cheapest, $8-$14 for a burger, and it doesn't come with any sides, those are extra. Not really worth it for the chickpea burger in my opinion, but I'm sure the meat burgers warrant that pricetag more.

The onion rings are magic though. not overly greasy and deliciously crispy. Apparently they go amazingly with the garlic aioli dip, which we ordered but didn't get until we'd already finished the onion rings. For the record they taste great with ketchup too. There was only one waitress in a packed joint and she took forever, but she was friendly and apologetic.

I don't know that I would voluntarily go back there on my own volition but if  friends wanted to go there I wouldn't be opposed and I do want to try the tofu burger. It is a quaint little burger joint, nice look and feel about it.

If I ate meat I'm sure I would have given more stars, my buddy said his burger was better than any he's had a Kraft Burger, but as for the veggie options, I've had better.

Bonus: they have a patio. A teeny tiny one.

EDIT: I bumped it up to a third star... only because I went back with a friend and tried the tofu burger. It was super tasty and much better than the chick pea mush patty and the server we had was much more quick and efficient. Still not one of my hotspots though."}
{"text":"This place is pretty terrible... the service is completely inconsistent and the burgers are mediocre at best, especially considering the asking price! Their $4 \"side salad\" is an abysmal, insulting joke. A pile of wilted greens plucked from a plastic bin for $4? Ridiculous. For $15 across the street at Libretto you can have one of the best value lunch experiences anywhere. I won't return to BQM, patio or no patio. A feeling of wishing I'd spent my money elsewhere is a telltale sign that I ought to."}
{"text":"Went, Ate, Through up!!!  burgers are bloody, buns are crap. saw 4 roaches in the basement and honestly i think is against the law to serve medium rare burgers. Never Again, and get it together!!!! want to know what i ate?! (BQM burger, sweet pots beer, wings tasted old service was crap shoot, the worst experience ever!)"}
{"text":"Best poutine I have ever eaten!! 

Complete with onion bacon cheese & gravy... delicous!

Nice vibe too"}
{"text":"Slow wait staff, onions in the burger were not peeled properly, under seasoned, too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Kinda funny that I'm always here after a movie.

This location, very much like the one on Queen, does not much have seating but we arrived pretty late and that wasn't an issue.  And just like the other location, service was quick and pleasant.  

This time I had the pulled pork burger with a side of salad.  First time with pulled pork in a bun and I'm glad I tried it.  Tasted pretty awesome.  Their salad was fresh but I guess that is expected.

Only complaint is that if you are sitting against the wall, you really have to sit up straight just because the bench is very narrow so you won't be able to slouch even a little...

It was a little pricey for just burgers and salad but at least I enjoyed it. =\

Cheers."}
{"text":"This is one of many joints in town that is almost entirely burger focused. Too bad that their burgers are not that great and their buns are atrocious. On top of that, you're paying 10 bucks or more for a mediocre burger that you could definitely have made better yourself at home. 

I had the burger with blue cheese, red onion and bacon. The server indicated that they would not cook it less than medium. That's too bad. 

My burger arrived on a bun colder than Chuck Heston's hands. There is no excuse for serving a burger on a cold, dull bun."}
{"text":"Nice Patio. Ok service. Decent Eats. Too Many Hipsters. 

I only sampled Poutine and Fries. Both were all right. San Pelligrino comes in large bottles! There is a chickpea burger that looks interesting.

The vibe of this place is not for me. Two Girlfriends and I walked in wearing straight-from-work dresses / blazers etc and were immediately sized up by honestly every single table. All eyes on the door. It was ridiculous. Get over yourself Ossigntonites.

I will be trying the burger on the Queen E location."}
{"text":"Had awful service here. Super confusing. So confusing in fact that they cut us off from drinking because they thought we were drunk. We weren't drunk we just were so confused why they were asking us the same questions more than once. So we can't order a beer because he assumes we are wasted. Food was mediocre and the service was trash."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to check out their burgers, grabbed a take out, daily special, ended up being the riverside burger, took it out with the fries and a side of gravy. While waiting the staff was friendly, and kept my water glass refilled. That was pleasant. 

The place was busy, which is always a plus. Lots of customers usually means repeat business, which in turn means good food.

The wait was not too long, I took my burger combo and bid adieu, looking forward to having it trade places with the wrapper for my belly. 

When I got to my destination to eat, I was more than satisfied with the appearance of the burger, I took out my fries, shoestring, could have been cooked a bit more, not undercooked but still relatively grease soaked, and there was my gravy on the side, as requested. But now here is where the difference between 4 and 3 stars came in. No fork, no napkins. Oh the horror. Lol. Luckily where I was mowing down my meal, I could get a napking, but no fork was available. Now what if I chose to eat my burger in a park? Would I need to wipe my hands on the leaves or grass? 

Anyhow, I was treated to a delicious well cooked juicy burger on a fresh bun, which did tantalize my taste buds, the gravy was alright, although I didn't have a fork, I managed to dip all my fries, as many as I wanted to eat that was, I didn't finish them as they could have been better, but definitely not the worst.

I will have to revisit this fine establishment one day. And hopefully if I take out again, I'll get some napkins and utensils without having to request them."}
{"text":"Honestly ive eaten at burger joints around the world so i know them well..

was the burger well cooked? absolutely... however it tasted like it had no seasoning whatsoever. not even the juiciness from the Fat (barely any) or the cheese on top could pick up a HINT of flavour. The Aeoli was mediocre and the fries soggy and mushy..

wasnt even take out! 

Plus the waitress assumed i wanted it medium rare like my wife (not the case)..

Nice place and atmosphere but my god what a poor burger sadly.. 

 honestly wont be back again.."}
{"text":"Went there for some drinks and munchies on a  beautiful Sunday afternoon on the patio. There were 7 of us and when we arrived there were 2 people on the patio and a large group (about 10 ppl) indoors. That's it. No one came outside to sit us on the patio so we helped ourselves and I went in to find a waiter. I find the waiter talking on his cell phone behind the bar, I wait patiently for him to get off the phone and then tell him that we're outside on the patio. He looks me straight in the face and says \"Just so you know, I'm the only one here so you're not gonna get good service\" and his tone was basically saying he doesn't want us to stay (like sorry we are making you have to WORK at your place of employment geeez). Normally we'd walk out but because all we wanted was a pitcher and something to snack on we thought...how bad could it be? Oh well he was right, we didn't get good service...we got ZERO service. I had to go to the bartender myself to get a pitcher of beer (who was very rude like I was bothering him) and our waiter didn't give us menus until we'd finished the 1st pitcher--about 45 minutes after we sat down. A couple of female waiters showed up in the last  1/2 hour of our stay but immediately went to serve the new customers. I had to twist the waiter's arm to get us french fries (which were tasty but a very small portion for a \"large\" size). Luckily we were all in good spirits and didn't let this crap joint ruin our good day. I'd not recommend this place at all...management either doesn't care or doesn't care to know."}
{"text":"BQM thinks they're a lot better than they are.

I had the \"Shoppe\" burger - Carmelized onions, horseradish, tom., grns., & aioli    for $10  

I had a beer, too.

So I got one burger and one beer and the bill was like $20. And no fries.

Was this the best burger I've had? No way. The worst? Nope. It was OK. Like 7 dollars OK. All I could do was stare out the window to Libretto across the street and think about the waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better pizza I could have got for less. 

Also, the inside of this place is dark and dingy."}
{"text":"D'excellents petits hamburgers avec votre choix de viande : boeuf de qualité, boeuf angus ou bison. Mais là où ils excellent, c'est dans le choix des sauces et des accompagnements. Un peu cher pour la quantité, mais pourquoi pas ..."}
{"text":"I had the $4 Caesar- though I doubt there was any alcohol in it. I didn't expect much from $4 though. 

We had the fried pickle burger. The fries are thin and greasy..not that good. Because I didn't get a fork I had to keep wiping my hands each time I reached for a fry. The burger itself is ok. The bun wasn't toasted. The beef patty was average. Kind of dry - not a juicy one. They didn't even give us forks. only one big knife. I asked for a fork and never got one. inconsistent service. 

From looking at the pictures on yelp I can say that it does NOT look like that anymore. The pics are from 2012, so I'm assuming things have changed....

It's an average place. Average food. I wouldn't go here to eat - but rather for the drinks and to munch on things as I drink.

They do have a side patio which is a plus."}
{"text":"this is one of my fave places for gourmet burgers - the ossington location (the queen east location is takeout only)! they have 17 kinds of burgers plus a veggie option and other sandwiches, they're all worth trying...the meat is fresh and top quality, and their patties are huge. their sweet potato fries and poutines are delicious! roasted beets, brie, blue cheese, portabello mushrooms...just a few of the toppings. they have a special aioli sauce that comes in a few flavors, garlic, chipotle...so good! 
i gave it four stars just cos the service isn't the best...but good enough cos the burgers make up for it. it's about $12-15 per person incl. sides (they're not included with the burgers)
must try: brie burger & the ossington burger with sweet potatoe fries"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of finally trying the newly opened BQM on Ossington, just south of Dundas.
I like the warm, western and friendly feel to the place.
It seems like a place you could just hang for a few beers or get something to eat.

I had one of the signature burgers while my guest had a veggie burger.
Both were outstanding.
The fries are great as well.
I like that they had a few micro brewery beers on tap. 
My new favourite place for a burg and beer.

It's great that this place offers local/slow food and endeavours to educate their customers on beef, food, and organics. You can tell they're dedicated to their craft and it shows in all aspects of this place.

Yeah, I know, most of my reviews are bitter rants but I have to say, this place was great, I loved it - great food, warm atmosphere, modestly priced and pretty good service.

The only reason I gave them 4 stars was because I want to go back a few more times to make sure they deserve a 5, but my first experience there was 5 star all the way."}
{"text":"This place is supposedly the best for the burgers. But, in reality, the poutine is my favorite in the city. The poutine gravy is (ahem, not vegetarian) but has little bits of Portobello mushrooms. The new waiter told us the ingredients, but all I know is that the mushrooms really worked well with squeeky cheese and fries."}
{"text":"Add this to my list of decent burger joints in the city. I think it's safe to say that I might have a problem/addiction and that addiction is burgers. I love them ALL, and I have a tough time saying no to any of them, and the other night at BQM on Ossington was no different.

A pretty good burger \"The Riverside\" made with Brisket - more marbled and a touch more moist (you have your choice in beef here on any of their burgers which I like), panko crusted onion ring, BBQ sauce, bacon and Mozzarella, Cooked to a medium rare. However given it's small size, it loses marks on price:value ratio ($12) 4/5

This spot was a very drafty location, they've put a curtain up in front of the door, but I had my back to the door and was pretty much frozen my entire stay here. Service WAS friendly and attentive, our server was very sweet. 3/5

My dining companion ordered the Mac & Cheese. Really nothing special, needed more salt, more cheese, less milk.... basically a revamp. I've made better out of a box at home. Might have even done better had it been baked. Mac'n Cheese should be creamy...the sauce bland and kinda watery. 2/5

I'd return here in a snap for a burger and a beer, but am going to leave this place alone for the winter months, unless I can guarantee myself a seat under a heater.

Eat Crest Out!"}
{"text":"BQM is a neat little burger shoppe located at Dundas and Ossington right opposite Pizzeria Libretto. I mention this because if it weren't for PL's 1 hour wait I may not have ended up hitting this acclaimed burger joint. 

BQM prides themselves on fresh quality meats, a comfortable ambience, import brews and great service. Unfortunately for me, the meal did not quite match up to the majority reviews I heard. Don't get me wrong, it was a solid meal, but not great. 

Whenever I visit a new resto where there are a multitude of options (in this case roughly 10 burgers to select from) I tend to ask the waiter/ress what the most popular/best tasting item is, and that was exactly my course of action here. Without hesitation she led me to the Riverside Burger: BQM BBQ sauce, bacon, mayo, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella, topped with a home-made onion ring. I decided to go all out like Kanye and stepped up my beef from Angus to Sirloin and I added another patty! I figured a $17 burger would be one to remember. 

When the burger arived it was at least 4\" high and I had to strategically eat it from top to bottom. In regards to the patty I was anticipating (as advertised) a medium rare burger but the 2 patties were somewhat dry. I saw deep char marks on them as well indicating to me they could have been flipped and taken off the grill in a more timely fashion. Maybe because we had a table of 8 the chef became a touch flustered back thurr. I was sooo hungry though that I couldn't bother to send it back and I just ended up eating it. Positive notes on the burger were the BBQ sauce, it was so rich, smoky and bold in flavour, I loved it. When it mixed with the mayo and bacon it was delicious. The home-made onion ring on top was so gargantuan so crunchy and so satisfying, definitely one of the best onion rings I have ever eaten and I'm hella glad we ordered a side of them. 

In addition to the burger we tried the Uber poutine: chorizo, caramelized onions, real old fashioned gravy & cheese curds on yukon gold hand cut fries. Out of 10 I would give the poutine a 7. I'm a caramelized onion slut so that was a high note for me, other than that the poutine came off a bit bland and the chorizo bits were not too impressive. The old style gravy was nice, it was a bit runnier than most and not as dark, but  tasted fresh and house made. 

Overall I had a decent meal. I don't want this to come off as a bashing review but I had a good time and the food was good. I have a hunch that the food has the potential to be much better, so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This roughly refined restaurant sits on the cusp of Little Italy/Portugal Village. BQM settled into this flagship location in the fall of 2008 and has been satisfying its customers since. Its take-out brother is located in Riverdale, and the newest sibling is a diner on Queen that caters to all the hungry little shoppers.

I find it funny that many delicious ideas come to fruition after a Torontonian visits New York. BQM's founder is no different. After heading down south, Saeed Mohamed was inspired to serve fresh, locally sourced burgers. And to me, it tastes like Toronto's best.


This afternoon my favourite duo and I met up for some quality time, and some quality meat. It`s always hard to pick a burger because their choices all sound so yummy. I'm still working my way through the menu. Today I decided on the Ossington - portobello, mozzarella, balsamic glaze and garlic aioli - while my buddies had the Sirloin Burger. With so many choices (including non-meat ones) and a selection of other tempting dishes - mac n cheese, pulled pork sandwich, etc. - be prepared to take a decisive stand. Whatever you pick, add some fries and gravy. BQM is YUM!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner before a show at the Garrison the other night. It's a good mid-priced option on the Ossington strip, and they have a nice little patio. 

I ordered the Hawaiian burger on brisket (at our server's suggestion), and I have to say, it was amazing. I have never used that word to describe a burger before. The flavours were fantastic and the meat was tasty. Our server was really friendly at first but then sort of dropped off as the place became busier. 

Why the three stars? First of all, the sides are all separate and I think they are a little pricey. $9 for a salad? And, no desserts!! They do have a good selection of beer and wine, though."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend Jennifer after work. We were both very hungry and wanted a heavy meal and what better than a burger. This place delivered on the food but certainly had problems delivering on service. The wait staff were very young and seemed to be lacking supervision. We waited for ever for our water and the waitress was too busy eating her own meal behind the bar to worry about our order. Finally when it came they forgot the tomato and it took almost 10 minutes to rectify the problem (putting a slice of tomato on the burger). I don't eat red meat often so when I do I like it as best as possible and this place just seems to drop the ball when ever possible.  The burger was tasty, the fries were good, but the over all package made for an unpleasant experience. And at $15.00 for a burger, they should do better."}
{"text":"This place was OK, but I'd definitely not go out of my way to eat here.  It was too expensive for what it was (2 Natural burgers, 2 sodas, and 1 fries, 27 bucks).
The burgers all come medium cooked, so be prepared to ask for well done if you don't like your patties pink.
Decor was lovely, they serve booze (which is a HUGE redeeming factor).  The service was sooo bizarre though!  Friendly - but it was like dealing with the absent-minded professor.  She had to ask twice what our order was, and not cause she forgot, but because she didn't remember even talking to us in the first place!

Altogether, I'm underwhelmed."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a shot because my friend had heard positive things about this place. 

I ordered the Hawaiian burger with onion rings and shared a poutine with my boyfriend. My burger was nothing special. I didn't even really taste the pineapple on my burger and even forgot I was eating a themed burger. My burger kept falling apart making it tricky to eat. My bowl of onions came with 5-6 rings...for $5 that was not acceptable. The poutine was good. However, they need to work on their fries to cheese ratio and again for $6, they could have added a few more fries. 

We paid $40 for our meal (the 2 burgers, 2 sides, and a pop) which could have been spent on a proper meal, instead of just burger and fries. The food was good, but this is a place I will not be returning to."}

Saeed offered that I come to check out their kitchens myself. They are trying their best to maintain a safe food environment and good service."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when the pizza joint across the street was an hour wait (you know the one). We both ordered burgers and shared some sweet potato fries. We both asked for the burgers to be \"well done\" but when they came they were bleeding on the bun. The waiter took them back but was unapologetic for the mix up. The fries ended up being our appetizer. Burgers came back later cooked adequately but I don't think they are any better than Gourmet Burger Co which is half the price and has never screwed up my order. I know they are two different kinds of places so it's hard to compare price, but when burgers are your speciality you've really gotta do them well so I feel like I'm getting some value for my dollars.

Place was packed on Friday at 7 so they must be doing something well, but overall experience was definitely \"Meh.\""}
{"text":"This is a solid place for burger and beer. I usually get whatever the special burger of the day is, but we found ourselves here on a Friday and there was no special. I had the Hawaiian (don't @ me), which they do with pineapple and fresh jalapeño. It was an excellent combo, I loved it. Burgers are big here, but not oversize, kind of perfect. Good bun. Salad or fries? I chose salad this time. It's mixed greens with a few diced veg and a really good dressing. Satisfying.

There's been a recent improvement (at this location, anyway) in the way burgers are served. They've switched from plastic baskets lined with paper to wooden platters. Things look better this way, and it's nicer to eat from.

One question mark for us was this little \"drug cup\" of coleslaw bits. There's no flavor in this sample (or not enough of it to extract anything besides soggy mayo), and even if it did, it belongs next to fish and chips, not next to a better salad and a burger. BQM might rethink this. If they think there's not enough coverage on the platter, how about a tiny taste of house pickle instead (something unique, like carrots, beans) instead?

We were very happy to see Collective Arts on the beer list on this visit :)"}
{"text":"Cashier left me standing for a while before I Bougt the lamb burger. I bought a bottle of water. Waited a long time to get it done and so I started to drink the water. They finally got to me to say that the lamb smells funny so they can't serve the lamb burger. I asked for money back and they refused to refund for the water. So I have wasted time and money at the restaurant and left without a burger in hand. The least they could do for me having waited so long and getting nothing out of the purchase was to waive the water bottle. I wouldn't have opened it if  they didn't make me wait so long or I would have drank it if they did actually give me a burger. So they forced me to buy a water bottle from them when what I wanted to buy and eat  was a burger."}
{"text":"Finally a place in Toronto dedicated to good burgers and beer! Overall BQM has definitely been the best burger I've had in Toronto and coupled with a good beer it really can't be beating if this is what you're craving!

I have tried the Queen St location, but the one Ossington is definitely worth the trek if you're looking for a quality burger!"}

Which, at this place, apparently means burnt on the outside. Even the bacon was  burnt. Blech. It sucks to pay $13 for a burnt burger. The fries were pretty good, but on the other hand, the soda was flat. At least the people that worked there were nice, and that patio looks like an awfully nice place to be in the summer. Maybe I just went on an off day, so I'll try it again, but based on this visit I'm in no big hurry."}
{"text":"(Actual rating: 2.5/5)

I made a quick stop here upon recommendation from a friend. It's situated in an old garage right by Dundas and Ossington. 

They have about 10 burger options, but what's unique about BQM is that you can choose which cut of beef you want for your burger - chuck (least expensive), brisket, and sirloin (most expensive). 

I was trying to save money, so I opted for the chuck. If you plan on getting a more expensive option, feel free to disregard the rest of this review. 

The presentation was nice (I wish I had a picture), but the burger itself was a little tough. There was nothing particularly special about it that would bring me back. The rest of the condiments were good, but when the burger itself is lacking, it's a difficult shortcoming to make up."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house, and when they announced their opening I was pretty excited. I am a burger lover, have been since childhood when my daddy would bbq them over charcoal. BQM is not shy about touting their provenance of fine farm fresh ingredients. So I was quite disappointed upon my first bite, as I expected so much more. I have been back with lowered expectations and still just wasn't impressed. The \"quality\" just isn't there for me after all their exhortations of grandeur and the high price tag for just a burger with additional charges for each and every topping. I half expected them to charge for ketchup, that's how nickel and dimey they are.
The service is nice, and the food isn't bad. it's just to pay $20 for a burger, fries and a drink while they brag on and on about how amazing their burgers are, you expect a lot more. I blame BQM - they set themselves up and do not achieve.
I do recommend the onion rings. mmmmm..those were some good onion rings."}
{"text":"I have been to BQM several times, most of the visits came a while ago when they first opened.  Their burgers were ok at first, nothing too extraordinary.  However, when I went back last month I noticed that they have improved quite a bit since last year.  I tried the wings, and they turned out to be really good, much better then last year. Their burger menu now gives you three choices of cut of meat for your burger.  Chuck, Brisket, or Sirloin.  Brisket was amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are in town from Birmingham, Alabama, USA and were told this was a fun area with lots of good shopping and food.  We randomly picked this place and I am glad we did!  I had the BQM burger which was pretty good, but the star of the meal was the poutine!  This was my first time eating it, but the cheese and gravy were delicious and I appreciated that there was plenty to mix up so the bottom of the bowl was not just regular fries.   I also thought the shallot dressing was good on the green salad as well.  Enjoyed the selection of local beers too! Great place!"}
{"text":"As hard as I tried to love this place, I just didn't find my burger (The Sirloin) particularly fantastic. It was cooked properly (it did have a tiny bit of burnt taste at the very beginning) but the overall burger itself was tasteless.  

I did enjoy the sweet potato fries and plan to try this place again to try the Ossington and poutine. I know I'm going against the grain here with my review but I just didn't love this place as much as fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"On a busy Ossington Street strip , it was very difficult to find a restaurant that was even willing to let us wait for a table around 8:30pm.... luckily, we walked into BQM at the right time and were fortunate enough to be seated after 5 - 10 minautes. The narrow restaurant had a mini communal table, that seated about 8, and a few more 2 and 4 tops all squished together. The decor looked like a wooden cabin inside, with dim lighting and lots of ladies working hard to make everyone's meal a good one.

There is a good selection of beers and as much as I wanted my usual blanche de chambly, but decided to go for the Kawartha Raspberry wheat ale. The beer was great, with a great fruity flavour.

What's great about the menu is the option to select your cut of meat - chuck, brisket, or sirloin... but you have to pay the price for it. Not a super big burger eater, my dear friend agreed to split with me - the Ossington which contained the usual fixings with a portebello mushroom, with cheese and a full portebello sandwiched in between. For the leanest cut of meat, it cost $13..... yes, it was my choice to go for the lean cut, and yes the meat is done in house, but one burger for that price... I thought was a little bit too high. No fries either, it made me feel a little ripped off. Aside from the custom option, I didn't think anything stood out. It tasted....... regular?

We opted to get the chorizo and carmelized onion poutine to share, but they were all out of chorizo!!!!!! The classic was our second option, and I have to say that a very generous portion of gravy was given, making me happy.

Can't say I'd come back again when I've been looking for ONE good burger, and I can''t say this was it."}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night and had an incredible burger. I believe it was the called The Ossington? Whichever one comes with mushrooms. I thought about getting a double but glad I didn't because I was pretty full, combined with a $3.75 pint of beer, which is the special for Wednesdays. Can't beat cheap draft.

Our waitress was amazing. So efficient and friendly. Always smiling and helping us decide the best level to have our burgers cooked at. The presentation of the food is great as well. Open-faced burgers on nice dishes. The onion rings and poutine in separate bowls as well. The place itself is really nice looking. Clean and simple and it was packed even though it was pouring rain outside.

My only complaints are that the poutine was crispy fries, which doesn't really work for poutine in my opinion. It doesn't quite soak up the gravy and curds properly. Also, they had the worst music playing -- some sort of mid-90s alternative one-hit-wonder radio station like Kid Rock and Green Day. It wasn't quite the right vibe.

Anyway, I can't wait to go back and try their other burgers! And it was surprisingly cheap for the three of us. We all chipped in a 20 for three burgers, pints, onion rings and poutine, and that includes our generous tip for our awesome waitress."}
{"text":"Why such a low Yelp score?

The cheeseburger here was WELL above average. I ordered it 'chuck' style which is less fatty than the 'brisket' style...and still found it extremely flavourful. But messy for sure!

Fries were meh.

Interior was not what I expected for a burger joint...it's actually very cute!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm partly guilty of reviewing only paces where I had a good experiences as I like to share places I'd eat at with friends, but this one warrants special mention. I had just secured the lease on my new apartment in the area but was already very familiar with the neighborhood's food emporiums. I had not however, tried the Ossington version of BQM (for those curious, it stands for 'Butcher Quality Meat'). 

Firstly, the girl at the counter greeted me with a big smile and a warm hello, which for anyone familiar with out great city and it's declining service levels, knows is not a given. I asked what beers they had on tap and was given a quick and efficient run down. When my friends arrived to join me, we moved to an inside table, then decided that since it was such a nice day outside we'd move outside. Upon being seated at our patio table, we discovered that we were down wind from a smoking table and given my friends are non smokers, and this was the only table available, asked if it would be too much to be moved back indoors. I will again reference servers protocol and say that at this point many servers would have grown tired of us and become exasperated, but not this girl (the same as who greeted me). She graciously accommodated our request, moved us back inside, helped us with the menu and specials, and our food was in front of us quickly. Overall very positive experience, and I'd go back any day. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"There are a bunch of really cool restaurants along Ossington between Queen and Dundas, but what the strip is desperately missing is a decent selection of patios. So we were walking along on a sunny weekday afternoon, lamenting the absence of quality patios, when we stumbled upon BQM and its solid patio. Sold!

We got a couple of seats outside and began perusing the menu. There were plenty of appealing looking hamburgers on the menu, but I figured it might not be a bad idea to try out their namesake: The BQM Burger (\"horseradish, caramelized onions, garlic aioli\").

It arrived a short time later and it was pretty damn good. The assortment of aforementioned toppings all worked really well together and the patty, though not the juiciest I've ever had, was quite tasty. 

I opted for the coleslaw instead of fries on the side, and it was pretty disappointing. It was undersauced to the point of tastelessness, but I suppose asking a burger place to have a decent coleslaw is just a little too much."}
{"text":"Yes the burgers are great. I had the Ossington with a tofu patty. But $9 for a burger by itself?? Much too pricey. Also the sweet potato fries were lukewwarm & dry...

I just can't justify spending $15 for a burger and fries when that could buy me so much more."}
{"text":"Riverside burger $9. Excellent. It's better than their other location in Riverdale, but that's great too. They asked if I would like it medium, and I said yes. It came well done. It was still excellent."}
{"text":"This has become my drinks place while I wait for a table at Pizza Librretto. This is a small place not a lot of tables can seat may be 30 people max. What I loved about this place was the single shot ceasers which are only $4!!!!  Four dolla caesers, unheard of to me! They were a good size and mixed well too. From now on I will come here after putting my name of the waiting list for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Why do some places confuse filthy with trendy? You really don't need to be ashamed about having a clean bathroom...really. I promise I won't think less of your establishment, nor will I find it inauthentic, okay? However, I sincerely appreciate the oh-so-ironic-yet-tacky \"e\" you included in \"Shoppe\".  

I went here with a group of hungry friends on a hot afternoon - we happened to be walking by and noticed a patio, so that sealed the deal. After scanning the menu for what seemed like forever ( plenty of appealing meaty options), I ordered the chickpea burger, which proved to be a tasty choice, albeit somewhat sloppy. I guess that's sort of the point with burgers, no? I'm not really a burger connoisseur, but these seemed a bit pricey considering the portion size."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at BQM Burger.

We both ordered burgers.  I ordered the Riverside burger and fries.  The burger was delicious!  I ate the burger, which was really filling, and most of the fries.  I ate the onion ring and took off the lettuce (not a fan of lettuce).

Gord ordered a Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger with onion rings.  He said the burger was delicious.  He ate all of the burger and, though, he liked the onion rings, he couldn't finish them.

They carry craft beer on their menu which made Gord happy.

Mike was our server.  He was really friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"a solid three stars
decent, inexpensive beers
swift, friendly service

sriracha for fries
(and sweet potato ones, too!)
burger was alright

nothing special here
just a good place to drop in
and yay, brioche buns!"}
{"text":"Great place!

Nice and cozy, good for any day of the week for lunch or dinner. 

I've tried a variety of burgers there and haven't had any complaints about any of them. They are nice and tasty, moist, and offer Chuck or Brisket burgers. Fries and onion rings are great too."}
{"text":"This was my most disgusting dining experience of the year. The kitchen knowingly served me spoiled food. 

I ordered a B&B sirloin burger, a side of Yukon gold fries and a chipotle ailoi. The burger arrived open faced: patty on one half of the bun and toppings on the other side. I lifted the tomatoes and found that the cook had piled rotting mesclun mix there. Not just the odd spot of ick - it was all decaying. On the other side, there were two pieces of bacon on top of the patty, but one piece was so burnt that it was black and dry. I took these off the burger and took two bites, but realized that I was paying $11 for this puppy. 

I showed the waitress what I had discovered, and she apologized and took my plate away. Five minutes later, she returned my plate, which now had four pieces of properly cooked bacon and what amounted to a side salad of greens - but the same burger! I called her back and told her that the burger she returned had had rotting vegetables on it and that I wasn't prepared to eat it. I told her that I had, in fact now lost my appetite and would rather just settle up. 

The final total for my fries (not special or particularly generous) a coke and a side of mayo (once again, not generous) was over $7! Plus $2 for the service. I will never go to this place again. E V E R.  There is no excuse for serving  spoiled food to your customer."}
{"text":"Nice burgers, nice spot, average experience.

These guys have a good menu but I was a little underwhelmed by the actual food. I got the Hawaiian burger with bacon and pineapple, and it was good but nothing to write home about. The bacon was the tastiest part, the pineapple didn't really shine for me, and the burger patty itself was pretty standard. I also shared an order of mac and cheese balls with my lunchmate, and those were pretty fun and tasty. Probably the most memorable part of the meal. Pretty decent meal for the price and our server was great. I'd come back, but nothing left a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Have celiac. Ate here. Didn't die. Food was decent."}
{"text":"This particular BQM Burger Shoppe location is a good hideout for burger eaters and beer drinkers to hang out during off-peak hours. It has a relaxed atmosphere and a rustic feel. 

The burgers are the main attraction for me, cooked medium-rare in just a few minutes. Drink and food specials here don't break the bank, but it's a bar atmosphere so expect to leave a tip. It's a reliable spot when thirst or hunger are a main priority. 

Must-try items:
Try the St. Ambroise stout, it's really smooth and goes well with a full meal."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

Seriously.

Originally when this place was in the process of opening, I thought it was going to be a meat store. Which was fine and everything, but I'm ecstatic that it is what it is -- an awesome local joint with phenomenal food, and a great place to grab a drink.

Inside, it's very cottage-y -- a wooden picnic table down the centre of the restaurant will do that. Everything else, from the pictures on the walls to the dim lighting, makes it feel really cozy and warm. On that note, try to stay away from the door on a cold night, it can get quite chilly and will make your burger sad.

And the burgers. They have a menu filled with a page of burgers, as well as comfort food like Mac & Cheese, and even a couple salads. But it's the burgers that I am craving already. They're cooked to perfection, and they're made with the perfect amount of pepper and spice -- they've definitely got a bit of kick to them, and I love that. I ordered the Ossington, which had a portobello mushroom, mixed greens, and a tomato. Sounded on the skimpy side for toppings (I'm used to my burgers being a foot high) but you don't want anything to take away from the flavour of the patty itself. Trust me.

Their poutine is definitely worth eating too -- it had amazing cheese on it, and their gravy was too good to be out of a package.

All in all, this place is my new favourite burger joint. It already looks like it's pretty popular, and it's been open less than a month, so expect line-ups in the near future. But I would wait in any line to have that burger again...and I hate lines, but I love these burgers."}
{"text":"Being from out of town (and country) my friend and I decided just to stroll down a near-by street to look for a place to grab dinner and a beer. Stumbled upon BQM and stayed for quite a few hours. I ordered the Banquet burger and we shared the fried pickles. Overall, solid quality food. 
We had some great service and conversation with the girl working there. Unfortunately, I never caught her name, but she made us feel right at home."}
{"text":"The prices at BQM are prohibitive enough for me to consider rating the place a 2 even though the food was terrific. $8-12 for a burger, depending which one you get (admittedly the options look awesome) and then $5-6 for a side of fries or sweet potato fries (you're paying extra for them being 'hand cut'). So $13-18 just for a combo, and that doesn't even include a drink!

I ordered the mac & cheese, which had a three cheese cream sauce topped with white cheddar and chopped tomatoes. You could tell the cheese was good quality and it was just cheesy enough to comfort me but not make feel like a lactard. Once again, $13 (!!) for a bowl of mac & cheese is too much, even though the portion was huge and I could only finish half.

Decor is beautiful with exposed brick, a nice rounded wood bar, and cool artwork on the walls. Massive beer and wine collection. Our server was cordial but overly perfumed/musked - I know I have the nose of a Bloodhound but I should not be able to tell when you've walked by just from detecting your scent!

Open up your wallet and try this place out if you want a gourmet burger, at least once. I don't think I could afford to go here on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by BQM Burger Shoppe because they have an ideal outdoor space to bring your dog and in doing so, happened upon a great burger place!

I had the BQM burger, or a burger topped with cheese, caramelized onions, aioli mayo, and horseradish, and it was one of the tastiest burgers I have had. Their burgers are also accompanied by a side of fries or a salad.

Furthermore, the service was extremely friendly, and the ambience hip. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I've smashed about a million burgers (always chuck, always good) at this location. It is hands down one of the best burgers you will get in the city. Everything is ground in house, you can choose from a variety of meats and cuts and get it done the way you like it. 

If you want a dandelion and truffle oil burger on an ancient grain stone compounded bun for 6 dollars, like some of the other reviewers, than this is not your joint.

I will admit I've tried to location on Queen West close to Spadina and it was not as good, so come down to Ossington to get it done right. The service is here is amazing as well. This is truly a burger joint with bold flavours similar to the heat of a 1000 suns. AWESOME."}
{"text":"I live under 100 paces from BQM's front door, and I've had a lot of the regular stuff on their menu... always to go. Cheeseburger, poutine, kale salad and chicken wings. 

Burgers are their specialty, but for me I when I come here I'm all about their 'tine and wings. Both strong late night junk food choices. Their kale salad can't be good for you, it tastes like hamburger grease, but it's delicious. If you want to pretend you're being healthy and indulge in some secret meat, this is the perfect salad for you."}
