{"text":"Awesome, it's a Burger King Bar.  Not really great food or beer, but pretty cool that is a fast food bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. The person working the front counter was rude, opting to yell at customers to get their attention rather then walk to them. 

When I asked for coffee instead of pop she said \"No\"  and I said \"No coffee?\"  She yelled \"Yes no coffee!\"  

Our food was very sloppily thrown together and was cold. Other customers left the line due to the poor service. The tables were gross, covered in ketchup and food and the seat I was using was broken. 

Go anywhere else but here. What a way to ruin the wait for my flight."}
{"text":"A fancy Burger King Bar? So confused.  

Out of onions. Out of mushrooms. Out of most cheeses.  Out of most items.  Why have ten things on the menu when I can only get one.  It was 4pm on a Friday.  It was the only option in that concourse.  oh well.  

Very lame."}
{"text":"A small Burger King that sells beer. the burger was kind of damp and squishy and not really very pleasant."}
{"text":"When o need a good burger before a flight this is my second choice haha but I can't complain it'll hit the spot"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place three stars for the poutine.   I got a classic with mushrooms on top.  It's not the best poutine in the world but by golly it sure was tasty for fast food. 

The service here is slow and not very coherent.
Takes a couple repeats to get the order right but eventually you'll get it."}
{"text":"Yes, it is fast food and yes, you are a captive audience, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this BK whopper bar.  They have six different kinds of whoppers on the menu and lots of toppings, both free and for an extra $0.50 each to choose from.  It has been millennia since I last went to a US BK, but I only remember two kinds of whoppers on the menu: whopper and whopper junior.

I got the angry whopper which was pretty tasty with angry sauce (read: spicy), pepper jack, and jalape√±os.  My dining mate tried the black and blue and was pleased with it.  

Again, remember that this is an airport and we are talking about fast food.  With that in mind though, this is probably worth a shot, especially as there isn't much else!"}
{"text":"It's Burger King and it serves beer....wait....what? Yeah so I had like 3 beers here and there are like 10 different sandwiches all whoppers. they should just call it whopper heaven. For airport food/fast food I thought it was good....don't hate."}
{"text":"found this yelp while trying to find a phone number for this place. 

My boyfriend grabbed a blue cheese burger from the BK Burger Bar in Calgary airport before heading back to Texas last night.  about 2 hours into the flight, the food poisoning kicked in. 

i'm sitting here with him more than 24hrs later and he's just now holding down soup and a cracker. 

captive audience or not.  this place is a MUST not . 

shame on you Burger King.  have it your way ? your way is low standards and poor quality control.  i'd rather ride home hungry than ever take a chance with two days in the bed, and bathroom."}
{"text":"When you are a captive audience and you are hungry, you tend to lower your standards. Being that it has been a while since the hubby and I have flown out of the Calgary Airport, we kinda forgot how large the concourse actually is, so considering our hunger, the fact that this was the first food place we saw and that we both thought Burger King wasn't that bad, this was our choice. 

When we were in line, there was a sign that states the new side options in the combo meals - fries, onion rings and \"fresh\" apple slices. The man ahead of us was asking questions that made me think he was asking stupid questions.
\"so...these are apple slices?\" \"And they're fresh?\" 
Yes, dumb, dumb. Read the sign.

I ordered the chicken sandwich and onion rings. Greasy, not breaded how I remember. When I say greasy, I know Burger King is a greasefest, but this one was worse than I can recall. 
And the onion rings? They tasted like artificially flavored onion something or other. All uniformly sized and shaped. Scary.

After my meal, I began to contemplate whether the gentleman's questions were so stupid after all."}
{"text":"Burger King has been in this spot in the airport for a long time. They've recently renovated and now call themselves a bar. I guess they can get away with this because they have a crappy selection of bottled beer to go with your Whopper.

I was flying out in the morning so I thought I would check out their breakfast selection as I never go to BK for breakfast. 

There was no line and when I walked up I had to wait a while for someone to come out of the back to take my order. Once paid I was told what my order number was and they would call me when it was ready. All I got was a sausage crosan'wich. As with most breakfast sandwiches I expected this to come quick as the sausage and eggs are all pre-cooked so the only time it should take is to assemble the sandwich.

I had to wait a few minutes. It seemed like the person responsible for make the sandwich was off doing something else and didn't bother to see if there was an order to make.

The sandwich itself was fine, but the poor customer service drops this to a two-star review."}
{"text":"Janine is right - there aren't many choices here for the captive audience. Once you're through security and US clearance, the Burger Bar seemed the best for a hot meal. It's standard Burger King with a focus on burgers. Whoppers of all shapes and styles from the regular Whopper to the Bourbon Whopper and even the Angry Whopper (I'm guessing the security folks eat a lot of these last ones).

Soda fountain with Coke products is completely refillable, which might be good if you are a big Coke drinker and you have a long layover.

Good seating with some view of the ramp area. Service was speedy."}
