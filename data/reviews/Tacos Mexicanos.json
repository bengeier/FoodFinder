{"text":"A solid choice for local mexican food. Way better than some of those plaza-type joints. This food actually has flavor and ya can't beat Taco Tuesday. Their servers are always very pleasant, but service has been a little slow the last few times. Overall food is very good, reasonably priced and facility is clean."}
{"text":"It was a very simple Mexican restaurant. I love Mexican food but it was my first time at this place. The vegetables were amazing as well as the chips and salsa. The decoration was pretty simple but overall a very nice family experience. Check them out."}
{"text":"As the name would suggest, Tacos Mexicanos serves up some meeeaaan tacos. The menu is somewhat limited, and you won't find much in the way of other entrees, but oh man do these tacos SMACK! On my first visit I tried the chorizo and barbacoa, and while both were excellent, the chorizo was somethin' else! Great spicy/ fatty flavor and it goes well with both the lettuce and cheese option as well as the cilantro and onion option. I also tried both the corn and flour tortillas that are available, and I prefer the corn; it has that fresh, corny, somewhat-fried taste that really goes well with the tacos. Tacos Mexicanos (or as my homies and I refer to it \"Mexican Tacos\") is a casual and unassuming lil joint, and it delivers casual and unassumingly tasty tacos. While it may not completely fill the hole in my heart left by Dos Coronas' departure, this colorful place has exceeded my expectations of what a taco can be for approximately $2.35. And for that, I thank you, Mexican Tacos."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Fajitas were dry as if they sat since lunch. Margaritas were mediocre at best. I've had better Mexican food at American restaurants."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Great food. Loved my grilled chicken bowl, chips, cheese & guacamole."}
{"text":"Really it's 2.5 stars. Not sure what the hype is but we went because of the nearly 5 star rating. Shrimp taco bowl was disappointing. Good amount of shrimp but it seemed like they just poured broth over it for flavor. Plus the sliced avocado was one small slice. Ok. Chipotle is better. Fajitas were  standard. Again a good amount of shrimp. Kids got tacos-standard and chimichangas-again standard. Guacamole appetizer was not good-bland and a little brown. Chips and salsa were good. The place is definitely not one $ either."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Love the management and the people that work there, always a great place to stop in and grab a quick bite to eat."}

Detail of evening:
Went here for dinner on a Wednesday evening around 7pm with my wife. There were approximately 5-6 tables with 20-25 guests at most so it wasn't very busy. 
The service was very slow the entire evening and there were a few servers on the floor. 
Once we sat down it took at least 5 minutes to be greeted from a server and once we ordered drinks it was another 10-15 minutes before we received those drinks. We got our drinks before we even had chips and salsa. By now we were there almost 20 minutes to get drinks and chips. Quite a long time compared to any other Mexican restaurant which you get chips almost instantly once you've sat down.
We decided what we wanted a few minutes after receiving our drinks and closed our menus and put them near the end of the table. 
10-15 minutes goes by before we have to ask our server to order since he never stopped by. I guess the \"my menu is closed I'm hungry\" cue didn't work very well.
We both ordered the Quesadilla Skillet which was very good. The food came out about 10 minutes after ordering. We asked for more salsa when our food came out since it had been empty for at least 20 minutes and salsa was never offered. Once we finished our food we didn't see our server for at least 15 minutes and asked for our bill which took approximately 10 minutes to receive. At this point there were only 3 tables with guests in the entire place so I'm not sure why that took 10 minutes.
Once we placed the bill down it was about 5 minutes to get our credit card back and close out the night. 
The food was good but very unimpressed with the extremely slow service. Had to ask for everything and it took about an hour and a half for the whole experience on a slower night. I would hate to be there if they get busy on a Friday or Saturday evening.
Advice for management: refill salsa, chips, water, and ask your patrons if they would like anything else. Nothing is worse than going to a restaurant with extremely slow service on a slow night and having to ask for EVERYTHING without the server ever offering. I was a server for several years and the less my guests had to ask for because of thinking ahead on my part the higher tips I received, and my guests were happier.
I might visit again, but seeing as we have another Mexican Restaurant less than 10 minutes away and this one is 15 minutes away I doubt I will be back. I usually don't feel like spending an hour and a half on a week night just to eat dinner when the meals on average take less than 10 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"Tacos Mexicanos is definitely a cut above any Mexican restaurant around.  Period.  Start with the menu...It's NOT set up like the cookie-cutter every other Mexican restaurant has where you  can order #1 thru #99.  Joaquin has actually given thoughtful consideration to what they do well and gives you Quality vs. Quantity of options.  There are a few nice twists on his menu that you'll not see at any other place, too.  The food has never disappointed, the atmosphere is a function of hard work and is cozy, and the staff is seriously attentive.  If you ask for something that isn't on the menu, they make it happen.  Tacos Mexicanos was our little secret but I think the word is out because when we drive by at various times of the day, the parking lot is full of cars!  Joaquin, the owner...he gets it and makes this a great place to come, relax and have a QUALITY meal."}
{"text":"Third visit and consistency remains fantastic! Excellent service and great al pastor.

Highly recommend this family establishment!"}
{"text":"Very clean and comfortable environment. Welcoming service upon entrance. The food was authentic and generous serving size, but nothing to rave about. Very dissapointed by the horchata, which is a must for any Mexican restaurant. Overall, it was tasty food at a suitable price."}
{"text":"Great, authentic little Mexi restaurant.  Some of the best salsa I've ever had.  Nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Portions aren't big, but neither are the prices so that's ok.  The guac and Arroz con Leche were both yummy"}
{"text":"I travel a lot for my job and one of my go to meals is Mexican restaurants. This place was great! Very authentic amazing food. You know it's authentic when they actually have chorizo. I had the chorizo tacos and they were great. The queso dip is awesome. Clean friendly and cheap."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places I've been to in the area. Highly recommended and enjoyed my time immensely there. Service was prompt and the food was fresh. One of the few places I can order a tamale and it not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times so far, and always have the same experience.... Great food, reasonable prices and good service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  great price. I ordered the Jalisco especial which was a sampler. My son ordered the shrimp and he enjoyed it tremendously,  my wife the tacos, all was tasty. Service was prompt and friendly"}
{"text":"They have alcohol!  I think they just got their license!  We almost didn't come but were pleasantly surprised.  Food was authentic and service great!!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and this is some of the best mexican food we've found in Ohio. All of the comments a out clean restaurant and friendly staff are accurate. If they had a kids menu I'd put it at 5-stars. We will be back every time that we are in the CLE area!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with no advanced plan. Just happened to be passing by and very pleasantly surprised. Taco salad and quesadilla were great and grilled chicken was very tasty. We'll  go back again when nearby."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! Great food, clean, and even better service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and the service is great. You can't beat Tuesday $1.00 tacos and their food is really good."}
{"text":"Best fajitas I've ever had! The Fiesta fajita had beef and chicken and a bit of grilled pineapple chunks. Every piece of meat/chicken was tender and lean. Fresh salsa being made in a blender when we walked in. My husband had a mahi mahi taco and fish enchiladas. All was excellent. Clean, friendly, good!"}
{"text":"Great food.   I had the shrimp tacos and the carnitas torta.   For the tacos I recommend the soft corn shells.

Seasoned fries were great.   Simple, well prepared Mexican food.   We will definitely eat there again.   I highly recommend trying this place.

Everyone in the restaurant was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm, is it good? Uh yea, it's good.  Really good. It's small (7 tables), no real ambiance, but the food and service are awesome. This place is going to wreak havoc on my diet--I've been 3 times in 6 days!!!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the LaQuinta across the street and ordered carry out. 
 Had the carnitas dinner and it was sooo good.  Great food at a great price.  Friendly service, too."}
{"text":"Been here 2x both for taco Tuesday. Great deal! $1 tacos for either chicken or beef. 

Limited parking. Service a bit slow. But food is good. And prices are good too. 

Worth a try if in the area. 

UPDATE:

Been here for a ton of taco Tuesday's now. Still good. Staff is friendly. Service still slow. But for $1 taco I still deal with it. Oh and parking is still limited too."}
{"text":"Stopped in because I was lazy and staying across the street on a road trip.  OUTSTANDING Mexican. Simple and delicious.   I will go out of my way next time to hit this place"}
{"text":"We went to tacos Mexicanos for lunch on a Tuesday, so my mom took advantage of their \"taco Tuesday\" special. She ordered 3 shredded chicken tacos with cheese and a water, while I had 3 steak tacos(not included in taco Tuesday) with cheese and a water. We also ordered some guacamole while we waited. The guacamole was pretty good, but I don't know that the small portions was worth 4 bucks. The tacos were about average for Mexican restaurant... considerably better than Taco Bell, but about the same as any other respectable Mexican restaurant. What really put things over for me was the price. I'll definitely be back for the dollar tacos on taco Tuesday, and maybe another day to try some other daily specials as well"}
{"text":"We are transplants from Chicago.  Tacos Mexicanos is by far the best taqueria we've found in the area.  Carne Asada, al pastor and coconut margaritas are my go to items and they never disappoint at Tacos Mexicanos.  The service and prices are good as well."}
{"text":"What a great place! I had the seafood fajitas! Wow! I always enjoy fajitas but these were amazing! So much seafood! Yum!  My husband had the seafood enchiladas- loved them. He said the corn tortillas were fantastic - could really taste the corn! And then there's the margarita!  Delicious!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ate here several times. Get fajitas chicken very good.  Come with complimentary chips.  Not that good.  Price is worthy of portions.  Also have tried nachos. Good but didn't care that they come with shredded chicken"}
{"text":"Food here is awesome. I was in town for a training event and ended up eating here all 3 days I was here. Good service as well. Would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"The service was very good. The chips and salsa were excellent. All the food tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Don't get the shrimp. Everything else is normally good here. Except on the rare occasion. I recommend the beef hard shell tacos with extra cheese."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here. The chips were in the colors of the Mexican flag--red, green and corn . The salsa was fresh with just enough heat. I had the #6 combo which was a ground beef burrito and a chicken enchilada. The meats in both were seasoned to perfection. I really enjoyed my choice. It also came with beans and rice. My mom also had a combo, but a make your own and chose the poblano with cheese, and a cheese and chicken enchilada. Her last chile relleno experience at another establishment was a disappointment, so this made up for it."}
{"text":"Third visit. The food and service have been excellent. I got the tamales special before it was very flavorful with plenty of meat filling and authentic Mexican. Their salsa is very good - lots of flavor. Their burritos are awesome - filled with flavorful rice and topped with queso. Went for taco night - fed 5 people for under $50. 

We are so happy to have a local Mexican restaurant again and the food is even better than the previous Mexican place. It is so nice to see a local business thrive in this location!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I'm from LA so I have high expectations on Mexican food. Service was great. I also really enjoyed their margaritas."}
{"text":"Great place.. nice people  tons of food ... great prices.. close to home cant wait to go back and enjoy some great food again"}
{"text":"Great. Fresh. Authentic.
Extremely clean restaurant.  Friendly staff.
Unpretentious.  Inexpensive. 
Go to this place.  You will love the food!!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed although the food WAS hot. (Temperature & spice) I had a shrimp dish which was drenched in super spicy red sauce. I quit after the second shrimp. 

The service was on the lower side. No one checked on my son and I until I told the manager I wanted my check. My waitress vanished. 

I'm glad other people had a nicer experience.  I wish I could have rated this different but I had to give it what I experienced."}
{"text":"Really great taco salad and tacos. Highly recommend! Great price point, service was friendly and prompt. Food was of good quality. Found my new mexi spot for when we are in town! Great taco tuesday $1 tacos. 
Thank you"}
{"text":"Quick, authentic and delicious!  We had a chicken bowl, tacos, quesadillas and guacamole with chips. No heavy sauces or retried beans that look like they came from a can. Just delicious authentic Mexican food. Will definitely be bad."}
{"text":"The best tacos and overall authentic Mexican food I've ever had in Cleveland area. I live in Dallas where authentic Mexican is everywhere, and this rivals the best in Texas. BTW, the burritos are huuuuge, you've been warned."}
{"text":"We've been to many Mexican restaurants in the area but this is one of the best.  The food and the service was very good.  I don't care for guacamole too much but I ate it and it was the best I've ever had.  The only Mexican food that I've eaten that was a little better was in a small restaurant north of Phoenix, Arizona."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to places for dinner. After a long day at the game in Pittsburgh we stopped for dinner before heading home. Our family was visiting from NJ and loved the atmosphere. We enjoyed our bowls, fajitas and sandwich. The margaritas are well balanced and flavorful."}
{"text":"I had the Special Fajitas and a lime margarita. Both were excellent.  Fajitas were fantastic. Marg was flavorful and only $5.95."}
{"text":"So authentic and yummy! Their corn tortillas are the best,  love just onions and cilantro on my tacos!"}
{"text":"Love their fiesta fajita.  One of owners of Dos Coronas that was closed for almost 2 years.  Love their wait staff and their attentions to detail.  Went to new Dos Coronas and it was not the same in food or service, so this is much better."}
{"text":"Pack your patience... even on a slow night. There is no drink menu and the staff gets easily distracted.

BUT... best burrito by far we have had since leaving the left coast!

Salsa is ok... queso was just plain cheese... would not get it again

Tacos come with 2 options... lettuce and tomato or cilantro and onions... which works for us since we are both #TeamSoap.

The Al Pastor was flavorful, but not overly spicy.

Shredded chicken was soft and moist... rice in the burrito was bouncy and warm... refried beans were plain, but acted the roll of consolidator.

They offer Belly points and while the parking lot was full on our second visit for Taco Tuesday there was ample seating inside."}
{"text":"This is an inexpensive, local hangout spot. So based on that...its a 5 star.  The staff really hustle around taking care of customers. They have a full bar. The fish tacos were good, the fish was chopped up rather than large pieces which actually made it easier to eat. The waitress was flexible on what they added, lettuce and pico for me instead of cheese. For a quick bite to eat, this was a great spot, local owned, good food."}
{"text":"Kudos to Tacos Mexicanos for opening a fabulous restaurant in a spot that has seen half a dozen others come and go in the past decade. My daughter, grandkids and I ate there last week and I am sorry I haven't gone there sooner. The staff is very friendly, accommodating and efficient.  The venue itself is spotless and beautifully decorated. The owner himself stopped by our table, asked how our meal was and if we needed anything, and personally brought me a Margarita. We had plain and simple tacos, but they were delicious as well as the rice and beans. I can't wait to go back and try a different meal! 

My only wish is that the building was wheelchair accessible so I could bring my husband in.  We were made to feel like old friends even though this was my first time there."}
{"text":"Temper your expectations a little and you'll be fine with Tacos Mexicanos. There are so many reviews on this place touting that they have authentic Mexican food, and while I'm not an authority on the topic, I would say that they served solid Americanized Mexican food. Not a rip, just my opinion. The place is clean, service was fast, and the food hot. Not a bad spot to grab a quick lunch located right off of I-271 and route 8."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic mexican food, this would be the best place. The tacos were amazing... I tried the carnitas & barbacoa with corn tortillas and they were perfect! I also had the carne asada tortas and the meat was tender but there was a little to much bread which made the sandwich dry. I added a some salsa and they were fine. We also tried the brownie flan! You must try it if you have a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"We went here after seeing the ad in Valu Pages. I never knew this place existed, but I am so glad I found it! The food is the best Mexican food I have ever had! The prices are great, as well as the service. I had the carnitas taquitos, and I was blown away! My son had the grilled chicken tacos, and my daughter had a chicken quesadilla, and they both loved them. Do yourself a favor, and go here if you want great Mexican!"}
{"text":"Best salsa I've had in a long time! Taco Tuesdays are muey Bueno!!  https://yelp.to/qTKq/q2xrcoWufM"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding, as was the service. Nice staff, clean place - great food for the whole family."}
{"text":"We were staying at a nearby hotel for the night and decided to try this restaurant due to its close proximity and the excellent reviews.  
It did not disappoint, they offer a nice selection of drinks and a large menu.  The service was great and our food was delicious.  
We will definitely come back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out for a while but I am a local and there are many places to go to have a good meal in the area so it took me a while. Finally I stopped in for lunch and ordered the macho burrito from the lunch menu. At 8.75 I thought it may be a little pricey for lunch but went for it. The plate came out hot and portions were good. The pork filling was very tasty and the salsa Verde was said to be home made and tasted right on. The rice had a mild taste and equally tasty as well as the beans (a little runny). I also had the regular marg at 5.95, good flavor and size. On Monday they are only 2.50 and I plan on returning soon. All in all it was a very good meal with good flavor, but maybe not the most authentic Mexican I've had but pretty good and WILL return. And I love authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried this restaurant over the weekend. We'd heard some great reviews. Well, the great reviews are well-founded ... this place is awesome! Very clean & inviting, with a friendly staff and fast service. The food we had was outstanding. We'll be making this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"We came to tacos Mexicanos for lunch one day while visiting Cuyahoga valley National Park.  They have some really good lunch specials!  I got the chimichanga for $5.25 which was the Monday special.  No complaints but it wasn't anything special. Everything was Americanized but I could appreciate the deals. I'd come back if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, love this place. Chips as salsa were great, guacamole is homemade. Had the tacos al pastor, it was perfect. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great option right off the interstate! The carne asada tacos I got were delicious! They have a very mild green sauce, and a slightly spicy (to me, I like much hotter!) red sauce. The restaurant was clean and welcoming, service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Everyone has their own take on what people like about Mexican food I prefer the kind that is served by people who work their butt off keep busy and are quick.  Seems like they have a special for everyday of the week here."}
{"text":"First trip was very good. Went back two times since and service was horrible. Messed up my to go order too. Last visit sat at the bar and practically had to beg for service. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's small and homey feeling. The prices are good and so is the food. Since Dos Coronas went away this is the next best thing."}
{"text":"Place was extremely clean and the staff was great. I'm picky about my tacos and these were mediocre. None of the shells were homemade and the tacos themselves were skimpy. Onions and cilantro, or lettuce and cheese. Pico de galo, rice and beans were ala carte instead of incluced as a taco platter, which would make the meal pretty expensive. The Mahi Mahi was seasoned well. The fried icecream was ok. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. The place looks small, but it is actually spacious inside. Service is friendly and helpful- food is fast and exactly how we order. Prices are reasonable and facilities are clean, bright, and well maintained. Never had an issue that wasn't resolved."}
{"text":"An easy to miss place with truly great food, it is worth seeking out this great little Mexican place.  Just off of Route 8 near I-271 is a small brick building with Tacos Mexianos, once inside you find a fairly generic dining area with minimal decorations, its clean but feels very minimal.  Once seated you get a nice basket of crisp chips and a small bowl of zippy salsa to dip, a good start. 

The menu has most of the regular Mexican items you are used to, but leans more on individual items rather then the combination plates.  Since its my 1st time I keep it basic and order a Mahi Mahi Taco and a Shrimp Taco, both on flour tortillas with lettuce and cheese.

The tacos were excellent, you start with a perfect lightly grilled tortilla, the protein, lettuce a little crema and a delicious shredded white cheese.  The shrimp were plump, perfectly grilled and delicious.   The Mahi Mahi was even better with a perfect hint of char from the grill.  While very simple, these were perfectly composed with a great mix of flavors.

I will be back when I am in the area; give them a try if you are out in Macedonia."}
{"text":"Love it, truly fantastic. Went one one of the first days it opened and they didn't miss a beat. Been several times since and it's only getting better. Quick friendly service and the price can't be beat. Would like to see a bit bigger of a menu but totally  understand because of the size of the building. I've heard rumors around town that they bought the space next door and will be expanding!!! Let's keep our fingers crossed and let's support Tacos Mexicanos."}
{"text":"The best Mexican around, AND they do carry-out! We've ordered from here 3 weekends in a row, and they have yet to disappoint. The tacos are excellent, the chorizo burrito is perfect, and the queso is top notch. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal Mexican. Authentic and all fresh!!! Literally tastes like Cabo!!! Excellent for take out. If you're from the area, you will recognize some of the friendly faces that once worked for our previous Mexican restaurant that has yet to reopen, but this place is Waaaaay better!! I actually watched them hand make my beans!!! Don't be put off by the location, it's a great quant authentic joint you've gotta check out!! Bring CASH!!! I was devastated when the previous joint in that location closed, but this place has helped my sadness :) Great food guys, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Tacos Mexicanos and love it. They are always busy on taco Tuesday but still very friendly and speedy. The restaurant is quite spacious and always clean. Food is always cooked to order and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I got the Burrito Ranchero and my boyfriend got the Sea Food Enchiladas. Mine was good, but he really enjoyed his! The atmosphere is nice and the margaritas are really good! Overall this is a nice and clean place to come for lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"I was expecting more from all the previous reviews. The food is okay, and at around 9pm the service was not great. The tacos are a trendy idea, try them mexicano with cilantro and onion. The shredded chicken is not that spicey, and the barbacoa and mahimahi were okay."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service. The food was great and spicy! Possibly my new favorite restaurant. Very good location and the inside has been updated and looks really beautiful. Prices were on point and don't break the budget."}
{"text":"Simply the best Mexican restaurant around. Friendly service and family friendly as well. You will not find better fajitas. Haven't found anything in the menu that we haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and delicious!  Authentic corn tortillas, freshest salsa, and every taco was perfect.  We highly recommend the barbacoa and the shrimp.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Taco taco taco it's time to have some fun and get some good eats. Great specials and drinks."}
{"text":"Overall: 5 stars.  An authentic Mexican restaurant with great service and reasonable prices.

Food: 5 stars.  Authentic Mexican tacos and very fresh.  They could give a more meat in the tacos since it seemed a bit light.  Chips were very good.  Salsa was excellent, especially the red salsa with the chips.

Prices: 5 stars.  Reasonable prices for tacos ($2.35 pork, $2.50 steak).  Chips and salsa was included!

Service: 5 stars.  They offered me water or coffee while I was waiting for take-out.  The food took about 10 minutes from order to bag.

Atmosphere: 4 stars.  Bright and clean interior.  Mexican music playing."}
{"text":"Awesome food nice stocked bar- awesome staff this place is a total hidden gem. My new fav restaurant in Twinsburg the best in Cleveland outskirts for sure"}
{"text":"Just tried it for lunch.   I thought it was going to be more of a fast food style but it was more of a sit down restaurant.   I had three different tacos : the chicken , the chorizo,  and the al pastor (pork).  They were good but not great.   The refried black beans were nice.  Service was very good.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is a great deal. Great tacos for $1! My new favorite Tuesday tradition! 

Taste:1/2
Presentation:1/1
Atmosphere:1/1
Service:1/1

4/5"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are excellent. Warm, crispy chips and the salsa has a nice spicy kick. I ordered a chorizo taco with lettuce and cheese, and a barbacoa taco with cilantro and onions. The chorizo was excellent and should have ordered with cheese and cilantro, no onion or lettuce. The barbacoa was a little overcooked and tough. The onion was too strong and stole the flavor. 

The menu has an excellent beer selection, Mexican Coke, but they do have Pepsi products (you're now forewarned!). 

Good place for lunch!"}
{"text":"They have a burrito bowl that is bigger than Chipotle! We enjoy eating here. All the staff is exceptionally nice. The margaritas & the salsa lack in flavor but for a quick lunch or dinner we enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. The best Mexican food around & will return. Thanks for the friendly service, Carlos!"}
{"text":"A nice,typical Mexican restaurant. I stopped here for lunch and ordered the lunch special burrito. Chips and salsa was nice and my aforementioned burrito was flavorful. Although not the most memorable meal, it was tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican. Fast service. Tasty dishes. Prices are a little high for typical Mexican but food it a little better to match. Didn't blow me away but good value."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and found this little gem through Yelp. It's not often you fine a 4.5 star review so we decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint. My kids are huge steak snobs and they couldn't stop talking about the quality of the steak. I on the other hand am a vegetarian and they could accommodate my needs with black beans and even their chips are cooked in a separate fryer from their meat products. The guacamole was fresh and the staff was so kind and accommodating. This is definitely a must do every time we come to town. My son stated, \"I have yet to find a stand alone Mexican restaurant that I like - until now!\" We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I've been to many Mexican restaurants over the years - and this is hands down one of the best!  Service is great too!  I wish this was closer to home - we would definitely become regulars."}
{"text":"Have eaten here since it opened on numerous occasions and really want to give them a shout out for excellent service and FOOD!  The Mexican food is fresh and delicious - the menu is varied enough that everyone can find something they like.  No frozen reheated stuff here!  The drinks are excellent and the decor is fun. The specials are varied and a really good deal. Only problem I ever had was when I ordered a drink \"not on the list\" - it was poorly mixed and watery-but stick to the usual Mexican mixers and you will be happy. Great place!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Mexican restaurant. Great food and service. Love the bowls... way better than Chipotle. Margaritas are yummy too."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets along Route 8, a simple little restaurant with a hearty authentic menu, great service, and a relaxing casual atmosphere. Unlike many other Mexican restaurants where the Mariachi music is almost annoying, the tone here is much more subtle, allowing for great dinner conversation and, in the case of my girlfriend and her friends, lots of laughter. Atmosphere really counts for a lot in my dining experience. This place is really quite comfortable without being cheesy and noisy. It got busy as our dinner progressed, but never felt crowded like people were sitting elbow-to-elbow.

The first thing the three of us appreciated about this restaurant was the fact that each of us got our own bowl of salsa when chips were served, making double dipping completely acceptable. Silly, maybe, but those little details mean a lot to avoid potential annoying manner mayhem from those less aware of their lack of etiquette. Our server was prompt and attentive, and very sociable, so both of those things got our meal off to a great start.

I found the menu to be quite reasonable and food portions were plentiful. My girlfriend ordered the Torta Cubano, which was sizable. She couldn't finish it (next day lunch), even with help from me and her best friend. I ordered the Burrito Cubano, which struck the right notes of spice and sweetness from the chorizo-pineapple-queso topping. I substituted the refried beans with black beans without a hassle. Our friend ordered the Tacos Mexicanos and was pleased with the just-right portion size. The fresh cilantro brightened the presentation and the flavor.

We each had margaritas--two jumbos and one regular (me). My traditional lime margarita was flavorful and had the right blend of flavor. The jumbo margaritas were a good size and a reasonable value. If you like Mexican beers, they have a great selection from Modelo, Negra, Pacifico, Sol, and of course, Corona. They also serve a Coronarita.

My only disappointment, a minor one, was the men's restroom. It needed some attention, but the rest of the public areas were quite clean and well maintained.

I am eager to return to Tacos Mexicanos and try more food items. This proved to be a really great hangout!"}

{"text":"Amazing made from scratch mexican food. One of the few that does everything by hand (beans, vegetables, rice, sauces). We live their vegetarian burrito bowl which has roasted zucchini,  green peppers, black beans, onions, corm, rice, and the nice sweet surprise of pineapple.  The owner said he likes to make it all fresh because it tastes better and we agree. Very reasonable prices and some unique items. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place was very good! The burrito Cubano was the best thing I've ever had in any Mexican place! We will most definitely be coming back to this place ! 5 stars from me !"}
