{"text":"I've eaten there 4 times and thought it was a cut above the usual Mint Hill fare availible in the area. The prices are reasonable and I thought the service was very nice on both occasions. Try the ribs, very good! The bakery is a great place to stop in the morning for coffee and danish or muffins."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic and the wait staff is very friendly. The food is decent but not for what they charge.
I haven't tried anything from the bakery yet so this review is not reflective of that"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant over trying this place since some of the previous reviews had panned it but was pleasantly surprised when it turn out to be a pretty good experience. I met my buddy Patrick D. there for lunch who was himself 30 minutes late but I'll get to that in another yelp review when I review him as a friend but I digress....Anyways, we had the spinach dip with pita bread for a app and it was a very delicious and healthy sized portion. The pita bread was served oven warm and soft which I have come to very much enjoy instead of the sometimes stale pita/chips other places serve up. For a entree I had a chicken sandwich on focaccio bread with pineapple chunks and roasted red peppers. The chicken was very very well seasoned and the whole sandwich just seemed to compliment itself in the perfect fashion. The service was prompt whenever we needed refills on our drinks and they paid enough attention to us without crossing the ever moving \"this person is bugging me\" line. Also, everything was reasonably priced. I think we got out of there with a app, two entrees and 1 drink for around 25$.

The only downside I would say about this place is the Theme they are rocking. It's sort of a beach theme with the servers wearing the flowered shirts and even Jimmy Buffet playing in the background. A little too campy for my taste but tolerable when having some good eats. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area of mint hill who might want to try something a little different and can stomach Jimmy Buffet long enough to get through a meal haha

didn't try the bakery side so no idea how that is working out"}
{"text":"The Bakery portion is 5 star - love love love everything they put out
As for the restaurant, breakfast is awesome - best sausage gravy I have ever tasted,  I have only had dinner once - it was okay 
The Brownie Cookies are totally awesome warmed up with ice cream on top....I will be ordering my holiday baked good here for sure"}
{"text":"It's bright and clean. My wife and I went on Sunday for the Brunch Menu. My wife had crabcakes and home fries and I had a Fritata and home fries. We thought it was very tasty. They also had very attentive service. Reading the reviews above, all I can say is that perhaps they've taken some of them to heart and improved. Our experience was pretty good. We're going back to try the spedies, which we haven't had since we left upstate NY."}
{"text":"Palmetto Grill and Bakery just opened (I believe) around September 01, 2011 in the vacated Mama's Pizza location at Brighton Park.  We had high hopes for this new restaurant since it is within walking distance from our house.  They have a full menu and a bakery with separate business hours.

They seem to have the typical new restaurant glitches with timing and computers, but they really need to get that Manager out of the kitchen and into the dining room to get feedback from the patrons.

So far we have had lunch and dinner here.  So far we are not impressed.

Lunch Food:
The asiago cheese and chicken sausage sandwich, $5.89, was dry and not very warm.  And where was the cheese?  Couldn't see it our taste it.
The onion rings were greasy and cold but they replaced them.

Dinner:
I tried the lump crab cakes at $14.99 with side dishes of creamed spinach and today's vegetables.  

The whole plate came out lukewarm at best.

The lump crab cakes were really not lump crab but a way over-stirred mixture of shredded crab and alot of bread crumbs.  Maybe they used to be lumps?  Don't know.

The veggies were tasty but again, lukewarm.

The creamed spinach?  Ugh.  Let's just say that when we mentioned to the server how thick and rich it was for creamed spinach (again, lukewarm too) we were told it was actually the same stuff they sell as an appetizer called spinach artichoke dip.

The server did offer us a free dessert but we declined.  They did take 10% off the bill though so they are trying.

Don't know if we'll try the breakfast.  We'll let you know."}
{"text":"A very nice local lady owns Palmetto Grill; she came to our table and asked how we found her...  I said Living Social, and I thanked her for partnering with them, or we'd have never known Palmetto Grill existed  :-)

We had brunch- I got the Monte Christo sandwich and my fella got the crab cake benedicts, both choices were tasty and we cleaned our plates.  We both had full bellies for less than $20 out the door!  You can't beat those prices for brunch!  I still don't know where the \"bakery\" part was, but the Palmetto Grill part was a hit!  We'll definitely be back  :-)"}
{"text":"This space in the Lowe's shopping center sat empty for a while when Mama's Pizza bolted for another space (in a different Lowe's center not far away). Now they have opened as a \"grill and bakery\" - that's a combination that I don't think I've seen before, and I'm not entirely sure that it works, so you may not see it again.

If you look in from outside, it looks like a bakery - but off to the side there is a regular seating area. But once you step in, you notice that the bakery is really more like advertisement for what sort of baked goods they offer, and does not appear to be too heavy on freshly baked goods - so those of you hoping to stop in for some fresh treats may be disappointed.

Once inside, it's a fairly standard casual dining establishment, and the service is pretty friendly - or has been when we stopped in. The offerings were a bit odd, but we could have still be thrown by the whole \"and bakery\" part of the name. We might need to stop back in now that we know a bit more what to expect. The other downside is that the prices are a bit higher than what you might see on a standard casual restaurant, but for what you get, the food is pretty solid."}
{"text":"I am a Mint Hill resident and \"recovering\" Chef. My credentials include heading a 4 diamond and 4 star restaurant, restaurant consultation, catering film premieres and private parties. My cuisine has also appeared on a national television show, so I can be, according to my wife, overly critical. I prefer to think of myself as seeking out a great dining experience and knowledgeable as to what a great dining experience should be. 
Mint Hill needs better restaurant options, hands down. I was excited to dine at the newest foray into the local restaurant scene and unfortunately I was overall not very satisfied.
Let's start with the good;
-Friendly staff
-Dinnerware was better than average, including some funky shaped serving vessels
-Server writes name on paper table covering
-Dinner rolls were ok for a frozen product, arrived nice and toasted

Onto the bad;
-Tropical Spinach and Artichoke dip; 
\"What makes it tropical?\" I wondered as I read the description. I was dreaming of tropical fruits and roasted red peppers masterfully blended into this Mediterranean inspired dish. What I received was a plate of molten hot microwave (read: soft and floppy) pita cut into triangles and what may be best described as a plate of \"tropical\" wallpaper spackle. Thick and rich, with unmelted parmesan cheese and sparse artichoke leaves left a lot of room for improvement. Oh, and what made this dish\"tropical\"? Unevenly diced tomato on top I presume.

-Beef Philly; 
With expectations not set so high for my entrée, I eagerly awaited my cheese steak. Because we're not in Philly I won't get into the whole \"with or without\" option missing. I ordered a side of the parmesan creamed spinach with it, hoping it was better than the appetizer. The HUGE Philly arrived and I saw the requisite onions and pepper topping the melted white (?) cheese. Notice the word \"pepper\" in the previous sentence is not plural. While there was more than one slice of  1/2 cooked green bell pepper, typically they are lettered with red and green. This is a cost savings measure since green bells are a lot less inexpensive, but we aren't in Philly so I digress...

-Chicken Spiedie (pronounced speedy);
This dish takes top billing on the menu with verbiage of \"World Famous\". In reality it's large diced balsamic marinated chicken on a roll, advertised to \"replace kebabs at a bbq\", lets just move on.....

The Ugly;
-No B&B plates offered with rolls
-Server never mentioned the specials, but the table next to us, with a different server got the rundown after we placed our order.
-Front of House Manager came to our section with 3 tables in it and visited two tables out of the third. We were the third.
-The décor reminds of a tropical island paradise

While Mint Hill is sorely missing a niche restaurant, one that isn't a chain of some sort, I was hoping the Palmetto Grill and Bakery would step in and fill the void; however they fall short in many categories. Maybe it's because it's still within its first months of operation, maybe it's the lack of training on the staff (my wife asked for a Cherry Coke and was told they only had regular and Diet. All other restaurants gladly offer to pour cherry juice from behind the bar into a Coke and voilà, a Cherry Coke); whatever it is, the owner best get a hold of the reins quickly or it is destined to become another failed restaurant within the limits of the Mint Hill town center.
2 out of 5 leafs, at best.

{"text":"Good food and service.
I'm sure most of these bad reviews are from the normal kinks you need to work out with a new place.  On our visit there were plenty of servers and even two hostesses so service was no problem whatsoever.
My complaints are that I asked for runny yolks with my eggs benedict and they were solid.  The biscuits were good but no butter to be found, only a dismal jelly selection.
That said the hollandaise was real and not stabilized powered yuck.  The potatoes were real and not rehydrated.  My husband had the fritatta and it was delicious and came with more that you could eat for $4.79.  Our bill with tax was only $13 for filling, delicious food with a nice atmosphere and friendly waitstaff.
YOU CAN'T EXPECT BETTER for these prices.  I think they will continue to improve as people in my neighborhood are starting to recommend and frequent this place more."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We were so excited. We had the Valentine special which included a 8 oz filet perfectly cooked. This was our third visit, first for dinner. Great atmosphere, awesome food! We will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I am truly surprise to find such bad reviews about this place, since it's been only open a couple of months.

I am a food addict and I just moved to the area and still researching.
First of all there are very few places in Charlotte that I like, and this place was one of them.

Here is my experience:
I ordered baby back ribs with mash potatoes and grilled veggies.
Everything was PERFECT!  

The service was great! My glass was always refilled.

Then I checked out their bakery, and it's really great!  The prices are low and the cheese danish was delicious.

Decor  is nice.

Over all I liked the place and I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I promised to update my review.  I've been waiting to have something good to say about the restaurant, but alas, after 3 more visits, I can wait no longer.

First, the good news:  I love, love, love the bakery and the two women who work there in the morning.  Great service, fresh baked goods, hot coffee. They even have free Wi-Fi now.

I could bore you with pages and pages of bad service and equally bad (and still not hot) food from the restaurant that I, and my friends have experienced, but I will spare you the sad details.  

All I will say is this:  I can easily walk to this restaurant...but I won't."}
{"text":"For now, it's really a 2.5, but because of the customer care over the phone, I'm giving Palmetto a 3, for now. 

Well, I just got home and picked up a take out order for my dad (yes I am a bad daughter and did not cook dinner for him -- since I am babysitting him while mother is on vacation). 

The staff was very helpful over the phone as I did not have a menu and nor do they have one up via web. The young lady over the phone was very patient, but not so knowledgeable on types of food, but again she was patient, so I appreciate that. 

My dad just wanted some kind of pasta without meat, so I ordered the Salmon Parma Rosa sans the salmon. I was quite disappointed as they only had two half pieces of yellow and zucchini... them knowing this was a vegetarian dish, they should have paid better attention to the order. Total bummer as the zucchini's were cooked perfectly! Honestly, the sauce wasn't bad, but I really couldn't imagine it paired with salmon as it was so freaking heavy! The color of the sauce was just that of Kraft mac & cheese... BUT it was good, but extremely HEAVY which makes no sense to be paired with salmon... 

Anywho, we will go back and we will def hit up the bakery. Hopefully, I will be able to do an update with stellar stars! I'd love for a small town business make it in Mint Hill. 

Oh, I forgot to mention, I think they are WAY over priced for the area and style of food... but that is just me. I wouldn't order this dish again and shell out $12.97 plus my drive/gas time.... 

Good luck Palmetto, but I see bad things for your future..."}
