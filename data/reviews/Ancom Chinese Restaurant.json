{"text":"What a horrible experience! This is the second time I've ordered food from there. The food is adequate. The egg and mushroom drop soup and the eggplant in oyster sauce were good. The egg rolls were extremely oily, the crispy beef was soggy, and the mushroom fried rice was meh. What I am most upset about and why I am giving it 1 star is that the person answering the phone lied about our order. This time, we ordered off of just-eats and it advises 45 -60 minutes for delivery. Ok, sure. We live less than 10 minutes from the restaurant. Our food had not arrived over an hour later, so I called and was told it was on the way. 1/2 an hour later....nothing! My partner called back and was told again that it was on the way and there was a problem with the driver. It then arrived 15 minutes later- almost 2 hours after I placed the order. Amazingly the food was hot. If we had been told the truth, it would have been tepid. We were also given sweet and sour sauce for no reason. The first time I did take out here, I had to wait 20 minutes after my order was supposed to be ready. It seems both times they forgot the order and then rushed to fill it when the pressure was on. If you're hungry and want to eat in a reasonable amount of time, NEVER bother with this place."}
{"text":"Only a so so experience here. First time we ordered a la carte and dishes were better. Last time we ordered the set dinner for four (option B) which was supposed to come with three different mains Sichuan beef, Hunan shrimp and chicken with mixed veggies. All three dishes came but aside from the protein the veggies were exactly like the chicken and veggie dish.  It would have been more accurate for them to say mixed veggies three ways or to at least put a sign on the door saying the chef was feeling lazy that night. Rest of the sides were okay but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Aw yeah, Ancom is good again! They have a great chef now and the service is awesome. Prices are more than fair and we always have leftovers because of generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in south Etobicoke.  Recently renovated.  Fast service and reasonable prices.  Cheap beer (not $6 per bottle).  Fast take out service also."}
{"text":"This place is below average, but its cheap. Westwood Grill on Annette is the best Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"Very happy to find a good Chinese food in the neighborhood.  The place was clean. I had fast friendly service and above all the food was very good.  I liked the spring rolls too.  The restaurant does not stand out and I thought it was closed.  Needs something to attract pedestrians. Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"For Canadianized Chinese food in Etobicoke, it doesn't get much better than this. 

People are quick to be critical but forget to speak up when restaurants do things right. I was surprised to see all the negative comments. 

Upon arrival, I decided to eat in. The dining room was spic and span. The service was friendly, though because I decided to eat fashionably late I think I stumbled in during their dinner time, so I felt a bit guilty asking for things while staff were eating. 

I decided to be super white (as I am) and ordered the General Tao Chicken plate and a hot and sour soup. The hot and sour soup was above suburban level but below Chinatown level. It could have used a slight flavour injection but the soup was fresh and tasty nonetheless and had thin strips of BBQ pork which were nice and lean (I hate when BBQ pork is pure fat) and nicely cooked chicken which was not rubbery at all. 

The General Tao Chicken was absolutely dynamite. It was fresh, hot, crispy and the sauce was delicious. I may have had better at some point in my life (I've tried it at many, many places), but for all intents and purposes I feel I can safely say Ancom makes it about as good as it gets. 

The spring roll looked like it came from frozen and it may well have been, but it was surprisingly good. It had nice long fresh strips of green cabbage and tasted like they added a touch of sesame oil, which did a great job accenting the flavour of the crispy wrapping and veggies. 

The fried rice was... Fried rice. But the quality of the chicken and veggies they mixed in was above average. 

I'm open to amend my review if I have a series of negative experiences in the future, but for now I can safely say this place will join Chinese Food Gallery in my rotation of go-to places for Canadianized Chinese food."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place was going to be good based on previous reviews, but this wasn't the case. The food was bland and didn't look fresh at all. We ordered hot and sour soup which tasted like spiced water with chunks of suspicious meat floating at the bottom. The main dishes were also pretty disappointing. 
I realised if you want good Chinese, there's no cutting corners, you have to go downtown."}
{"text":"had ancom for lunch once again. had the house special tofu stir-fry $8.95 comes with firm tofu/bbq pork/chinese greens/onions/shrimp/carrotts/celery, in the usual chinese cornstarch thicken sauce.  steam rice on the side and a pepsi.  $12.75 tax + $2 tip. enough for two people...will be back again when out there for sales calls"}
{"text":"Although I gave it a bad review before, I went back a few more times and have changed my mind.

It's a good, local takeout chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Their food is amazing.  I always get the General Tso chicken here! They MASTERED it!! I think they do ANYTHING PERFECT HERE! A must try! ! The owner and everyone there is friendly and greets you like a restaurant should! Caters to your every need and doesn't ask anything in return. Whenever I'm in the area I try to stop in for sure!"}
{"text":"Dining room was spotless. The eggrolls were filled with alfalfa spouts and carrot. Tastes cheap. The food came out blazing fast. The chicken fried rice was dry and pretty boring. The general tao was just ok. Clearly everything comes out of pre-made sauce containers."}
{"text":"This is a pretty non-descript place from the outside but they serve good Chinese food at decent prices.  I've tried lots of their dishes and also dinner for two and for four.  All were good to very good.  Really like the Cantonese chow mein.  The place is clean too.  Parking is metered street parking."}
{"text":"Great service, very good food. Amazing deep-fried chicken wings -- the squeezed lemon was the zinger. Price reasonable, portions wonderful. Clean and modernized from top to bottom. Recommended."}
