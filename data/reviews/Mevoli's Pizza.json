{"text":"We have been ordering from them since they came to Brunswick. Although a little pricier than others in Brunswick, it is worth the couple extra dollars. When we order for parties, everyone comments on how good the pizza is."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, good prices.  My mother-in-law gets their salads, and they have not let her down!  I recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza  and it was exactly what I ordered. The dough was a little chewy and seemed to need to proof another day. The red sauce was good, not to sweet not to tart. The cheese was more than I expected and was probably a 3 cheese blend.(pleasant surprise)

However I had a problem with service. They are simply understaffed for a Friday.

 The  young men there sag their pants below their underwear. Which is distasteful in  some circles."}
{"text":"While searching online for a good, non-chain pizza place in Brunswick that delivered, I stumbled upon Mevoli's. I'm glad I did! Got a medium pizza with 3 toppings and an order of cheesy bread for under $20. The pizza was nice and cheesy, not too much sauce and not too greasy. The cheesy bread was awesome too! And it comes with a nice large cup of marinara to dip them in. I will definitely order from Mevoli's again :)"}
{"text":"I had a $15 coupon for a specialty pizza and I decided to get there meat pizza. The guy at the counter was polite and waited for me promptly. 
The pizza wasn't so good.  It just didn't taste fresh. It tasted kind of salty and a lot of the toppings were hard. I had no desire to eat the crust either, again it just didn't taste freshly made.  I not sure if I'll give them another try."}
