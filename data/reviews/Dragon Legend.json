{"text":"Went for Buffet with my family on Tuesday night! Arrived at 7pm, crazy parking area , parking full and my husband need to park his car at other mall and then he walked to restaurant!   Food not bad and more choice than others!  Service so so !  I love the desserts bar better than others!"}
{"text":"Dinner tonight, many people need to line up. $32 before tax and tips is too expensive to me. Food is ok but not many items."}
{"text":"The first thing that struck me when we entered the Dragon was the warm and sincere reception. Friendly, welcoming, and the seating was perfect followed immediately by our server.  This restaurant is a fusion between Chinese and Japanese, the selection of sushi and sashimi was fresh, well presented, and an abundance of sashimi to satisfy your fish needs. I was impressed with the Japanese food. The decor was also very impressive and spacious.  The Chinese offerings were more on the fast food side. There were some specialty dishes like curried fish balls, asparagus with pork, grilled squid and Chinese sausage and (Not often seen, Fresh Peking Duck!), freshly made (In-House) Chinese noodles.  The clientele was mainly Asian, I always find that to be a good sign, and you could look at the Dragon as \"The Mandarin for an Asian clientele\", I think that would fit.  Dessert offerings were extensive and again fresh and inviting. I also enjoyed the authentic Chinese teas that they offered for around $4 for a pot, and well worth the money.  So, overall I had to score higher for the reasons outlined above. It's not the cheapest place in town, for the two of us without alcoholic drinks and a tip, it was close to $80 dollars. Still, I would recommend the Dragon, and certainly if you're having a group going out for dinner, they have lots of space and seating to accommodate that as well.  Keep up the great work!  Jim"}
{"text":"I didn't actually get to eat here, and I'm sure the food is pretty good as the listed spread of items sounds appetizing and the crowds that flock here are ridiculous. My rating is solely based on my annoyance with them as I called earlier to make a reservation. It was at this time that they told me not to bother as they always had plenty of tables for 2 available. I wanted to reserve a table anyways, but they ensured me it would be fine. 45 minute minimum wait time when I show up. Partially my fault as I should have insisted on the reservation buy still pretty annoying.  Moral of the story for you is make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Probably this is the best buffet in the gta area. Very good selection of food. Lots of choices and the seafood is excellent. This place is way better than manadarin. Reasonable price for what you are getting.  Place also looks nice and clean which is a plus. Would return for sure."}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday night and I am quite disappointed about the food and service there.   I have to lineup and wait at least twenty minutes for a bowl of noodles. Then I have to lineup and spend about the same time to wait for a piece of the so-called AAA steak. And another 15mins lineup for just a piece of Peking duck. The food choices are so limit and serve in small portion too. So they need to keep refilling and let the customers to wait.   Too much waiting overall even on a Thursday night. What a nightmare. I think Dragon Pearl or Mandarin or Spoonful are much much better than this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with a large party and food variety was above average. However being told there was 20min left in our 2 hour sitting and hovering around clearing the table of everything near the 5 to 10mins left mark was crazy. I know they want to turnover the table at least 2x a night, not to mention paying $30 a head! This place is not fast food McDonalds and ruined an otherwise enjoyable dinner. Definitely would not go back for that reason as there are plenty other places I can spend $30 to eat in peace and not feel like cattle."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant closed to their closing time on a weeknight.  I didn't expect much food or replenishment, but everything turned out surprisingly well.  There were tons of varieties to choose from (hot & cold).  There were not much choices of sushi tho, but the other yummy food made up for it.  The Peking duck was really good as well.  Love love their longevity soup...I think I had 2.  Surprisingly, there were no crab legs.  The dessert section was very nice too.  I can't believe they had the tofu pudding and red bean soup(don't see a lot of those in a buffet).  I was so stuffed that I had to skip ice cream....and I do have a sweet tooth!!"}
{"text":"The sanma or saanma fish was off the chain!! Next time I will definitely eat more creme brule!"}
{"text":"For a Chinese from NJ, this place is a steal.  With the exchange rate, you cannot get a better deal than this.  Food were good to New Jersey standard. Compare to authentic Chinese, can still take some improvements.  Love the steamed soup. It is served as individual ceramic container.  The robot cut noodle was good too.  Sushi part is not what I expected but I have no problem skipping that and go for other food. There were plenty of choices."}
{"text":"Chinese buffet.  Nice environment, good decorated.  Great variety choice of food.  Recommend sushi and chinese roast peking duck is a must try items."}
{"text":"The a-typical Chinese buffet with sushi mixed in. IMO, it seems like the owner of dragon pearl owns this place as well.  The quality of the food is quite good and hot. I think the high costs covers the nice decor and ornaments, as similar food choices can be found at other buffet restaurants. $35 per, not including drinks.   I would only come back only on special occasions and for the black sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"We had supper at Dragon Legend last night to take advantage of the Tuesday $20.99 dinner buffet specials.   The food was better than what they served during lunch time because of the availability of roast beef, sashimi, and Peking duck.   The waitress were prompt and courteous.   I only gave this restaurant a 2 stars becasue:  1.   The noise level was unbearable.   Small kids crying, and the music being played just seems so loud and inappropriate.  2.   The waiter, who didn't serve our table of 5 ever before, brought us the final bill.  He rudely told us that we didn't include enough tips.  I think that's quite ridiculous as the amount of tips should be entirely up to the patrons.   Our $7.50 tips seemed like an insult to this man.   Just very unprofessional.  We will not go back to eat there again."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian buffet in uptown. This place beats Mandarin any day in terms of atmosphere and food.   There's a variety of food selection, and they are all very fresh. I took a star off because they stopped serving my fav okra dishes and also you can't get sashimi yourself. They have a server giving sashimi three pieces only each time. The sashimi are really big pieces though. The soup were also really well made, but they were a little too salty to my liking.  The place has really good ambiance and the decoration is really upscale. Servers are very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a new fav spot for us. This place was the old celestial court. Now it is this amazing gem. Walking in you will think you are in a Asian fusion place like PF Chang. But he attention to detail in the setting and food astonishes me.  The dim sum offering was all very well designed. Abalone Sui Mai, deep fried shrimp balls in the Custom design wood stand. Tea is delivered in glass tea pot sitting on this glass stand with a tea light  warming your tea.  The desserts are very well executed.  These days most restaurants use frozen dim sum or Wholesale made - full of MSG and oil. I did the ultimate msg test, and found no after taste or head ache. YES! Finally another good dim sum place.  The service is well executed. Tea was refilled .   Recommend for dim sum parties for large groups.   Will go back for sushi.."}
{"text":"This is not the typical buffet .... we came here on Thursday night and my o my ... this place is packed... When you see 95% of this chinese restaurant are asian, then u know its good. It is not easy for senior citizen to go out and eat in the restautant... But I could see SOO MANYyyy of them there and they actually enjoying the food..  FOOD - handpulled noodles and fresh sliced noodles  - peking duck crispy skin - the longevity soup is really good just like homemade - dimsum-- the har gaw is super but siomay and crry fishballs  - they have pork knuckles very well season and lots of other seafoood dishes  - they also have fried and grilling area for different kinds of food - sushi is not much choices but sashimi is fresh -dessert- they have dong shui, tofu fa, moon cake, and nothing special ....other than the waffles... they were salty yuckk DRINK I ordered the hot tea and they served it in double isulation cup so cute .... but they dont sell it there  But overall... this place has good food for the price you pay and I will come again if I am in the area...."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here. Quite similar decor style like 'Dragon Pearl'. The seating capacity is quite big though. I've seen a big table be seating like 20+ ppl. We went on a Wednesday, and its a brief show by this 'Masked guy'. Apparently he can switch his face multiple times w/o you realizing. I noticed the trend, but you can find out if you go that day...Won't spoil for you.  The food is definitely quite selective and big for a weekday dinner.   They have:  Noodle Station- Make your own noodle kind of thing. Cold fruit and Seafood station- watermelon, grapes etc., Cold shrimp, mussels, cold salad. Sashimi roll station- salmon, octopus, butterfish, albacore tuna sashimi. They have some maki rolls. 2 section of hot food station: shrimp/scallop stir fry, okra, curry fishball, steam fish, blackbean mussels, fried shrimp, noodles, fried rice, fried chicken, eggplants etc., 1 grilled section station: red sausage bbq, pineapple, beef rib, grilled OYSTERS!, grilled squid, corn, mash potatoes, sweet potato cake, dumplings etc., Dessert section station: Bunch of cakes and ice cream, waffles etc., Soup section station: hot n sour, wonton soup, yam and chinese herb soup, red bean soup. Tofu w/ sweet syrup (Chinese dessert).  To top off all those selections... There's also PEKING duck with wrap...They give you as much as you desire!!! Also the grilled oysters, they give you two at a time, but you can come back as much as you want...  We also got this tea call osmanthus cold beverage and its noice!!! Its priced $27 pp, with tax and tip its prob closer to $35...Its actually quite worth based on what's available. The decor is nice. Service seems pleasant. And food is prob one of the more selective ones..."}
{"text":"This place is great although super busy. Went for the first time on a Thursday night and couldn't find parking. The decor is very impressive, from the lobby to the super tall, wooden chairs at the reservations/large party tables. A great place to have a party actually, as half the restaurant was booked for an large event and another corner held a kid's birthday party.  The food they have pretty fresh and well-made as well as tasty. Layout is not that great as there is plenty of seating but the actual food tables are a little crowded. The selection is focused on Chinese and Japanese food. You can see, at two stations, cooks grilling seafood or making noodles (cut by hand straight into a massive pot!) which is fun to observe while waiting in line. And you will wait in line! This place seems to be really popular. I would recommend the sashimi and teppanyaki selection as well as the peking duck (where else can you get essentially unlimited peking duck?) Service didn't stand out to me but they had nice glass teapots set on candles that they refilled almost often enough.  TL;DR  Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 5/5  Bonus! The Dragon Legend Lucky Draw. You get a code that you can take home and submit online to see if you win prizes, such as a free meal or iPhone 5! Sadly, you have to wait 24 hours between each submission, unless you use another email address."}
{"text":"I liked the decor and the restaurant was nice and clean.  The servers were always coming by and picking up our plates and they were all polite.  There is a very large selection of different food items to pick from and all of it was pretty good quality for a buffet.  I liked that there were always crab legs available and you didn't have to stand there and wait for more.  The noodle bar was interesting and different.  The sushi is not great so I would skip that but everything else was pretty good.  They had a good variety of items to pick from and the dessert section was huge!  It is on the pricey side though for a buffet."}
{"text":"For AYCE Chinese places, this is excellent.   Service is good.   Food is always fresh.  Lunch and dinner menus differ.  No Peking duck, no Sashmi at weekday lunches (but available for weekend lunch).   A bit pricey but decent money versus value if your looking for a good AYCE Chinese place.   Roasted chicken is tasty.  Homemade Noodle station is decent.   I come quite often and have yet to be disappointed.  I use to go to Mandarin but haven't been back there since discovering this place.   Parking can be difficult if you arrive during peak times."}
{"text":"Me and my friends had been to this restaurant several times. We came again on Thursday tonight having a pre-celebration for our Christmas festival. Surprisingly, I found this time on the buffet table - crab legs, deep fried oysters, a variety of sashimi, sugar free desserts..."}
{"text":"We had Dim Sum here on Monday for the first time. The interior decor was stunning. Very comfortable and spacious seating areas. For larger groups, they offer a couple of extra long tables with very high back chairs. The tables alone were already show pieces. This is the right place to impress your clients. The service was excellent, my wife asked to change the table twice as she needed a table near a receptacle for her laptop, the servers were all very accommodating and even changed the setting on one table that was previously set up for buffet instead of dim sum. We went to the buffet section for a tour, and can see that all the food were neatly presented in special holders, and not simply \"dumped\" onto simple dishes like other buffet restaurants.  As for the quality of the dim sum, I would have to say that they are below average. Not because of poor presentation or they tasted bad, but it was the amount of MSG the chef had put in that turned me off. I was extremely thirsty the whole time while in the restaurant and after eating there. If they have to put in so much MSG to make the food taste decent, then you wonder if they had used top quality ingredients to begin with. For the super high price they charge you would expect the ingredients to be top notch without needing help from MSG. Anybody can be a top chef with adding tons of MSG, but I don't expect that from a restaurant of this calibre.  Overall, 5 stars for atmosphere and service but a 2 stars for food."}
{"text":"We were a group of 6 and we were so excited to finally try this restaurant. We love AYCE restaurant. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst restaurant we have been to. It was too crowded. The hot food was cold and the food was bland. On top of that, we all came home sick. Very disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because the host and waiters/waitresses were great."}
{"text":"I came for weekend dinner and it was one of the most refreshing buffets I've been to. The 'steak on demand' at the grill and the Peking duck were pretty good. They also served sashimi at the sushi stand.  Overall, the selection is great along with the decor."}
{"text":"BEST.LEMONS.EVER  oh and if you want a show - the communal hand wash stations are where its at"}
{"text":"Therefore is a lot to choose from and some things I've never seen before. There are lots of stations around the edge of the buffet room with people cooking the food.  The problem was, ALL the food I got was cold. The second time round, even the fresh stuff was lukewarm at best.  It was also RAMMED and very noisy.  The worst part was when I came to get dessert and there was no sorbet!! Mandarin is definitely better on this. The cakes were all tasteless as well, very poor tiramisu.  If you want proper Asian food, this is where to come, they come here in droves, otherwise just go to your local take out. The woman on the front desk was rude and completely ignored us until I asked for help."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum during lunch time. Probably one of the best dim sum places I've been to . A little pricey comparable to crown prince but I find the better dim sum places usually are. Had lots of different dishes most of them were awesome a couple were good....Nothing was terrible. My favorites were spring roll wrapped in rice roll... Comes with a peanut sauce and is sooooo good.... Also bbq pork in fuff pastry is awesome. Har Gao and sui mai are really lite and not greasy as in some places I have been too...steamed ribs and fried octopus, we're decent but not the best I had. Service is decent but can be slow sometimes as the place was full. Food comes out relatively fast. Recommend getting a reservation. This place has a really nice environment and decor is really cool. Also took some take out for my gf. Fried Rice and sesame chicken are really good."}
{"text":"The decor in this place was beautiful! The food was amazing! This buffet has become my new favorite! The staff were amazing and really quick! I will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"One of the better buffet settings - decor is great, and the fact that they have several different dining rooms made things feel more intimate.  A couple of the more unique offerings are the Peking Duck carving station, and the individual \"stewed\" chinese soups.  Otherwise, it's what you'd expect from one of these buffets.  It was great that we were able to make a reservation for a large family lunch, despite the timing being around Chinese New Year.  The place was packed, but food was constantly refreshed.  It was easy to flag down a server for water - we had to request several times before this arrived.  But plates were always cleared from the table in a timely fashion.  Parking is in the lot is limited;  we ended up parking on the street in the industrial park.  All the better to walk off the feast we indulged in."}
{"text":"The quantity of the food here was not as large as other Asian buffets that i have been to; however, the quality of the food is great especially since everything taste fresh and not frozen. I would prefer that they would have more food in their selection, but overall definitely recommend tourist or even citizens of Canada to come her for a filling meal."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet, Dragon Legend actually has quality. My favorite is the Peking Duck and I go back for unlimited rounds! They have a great selection when it comes to food - fresh sashimi, Chinese soups, assortment of popular Chinese dishes, noodles, desserts, you name it! I've been multiple times and would always go again. Only things to watch out for is that it is super busy on the weekends (maybe go earlier at 6pm) and the front reception and parking lot area can be like a zoo. Otherwise, you should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"For an all you can eat buffet place, it's pretty good and I wouldn't mind going back.   When we first arrived and saw the parking lot, we thought it would be super busy (btw, we went on a Wednesday); however, when we went inside we were seated immediately. The parking lot is just chaotic. It took my boyfriend 15 minutes to find parking.   The food choices were good and they had a hand shaved noodle which is not typical for a buffet place. It was very good. The service was pretty good as well. They were very good at clearing plates. Often, we would just finish our food and someone is already offering to take our plates. The sashimi was very fresh though for the salmon, they actually had someone stand there to hand it out because it was limited to 3 pcs each time. The place is large and the food was spread out with enough space to walk around.  Would definitely return. Much better than Mandarin and other places I've tried."}
{"text":"I had come here for lunch six months ago and decided to give the dinner option a try. I've been here for dinner twice in the last month, and I must say that, for buffets, the food is quite decent here. One major issue I had was with the wait times, specifically on my first visit where reservations were made for 7:30, and we weren't seated until 8:00. The worst part was that it was so busy, we had to wait outside in the rainy, soggy weather. Despite this, I was pleasantly surprised with the selection of sushi and sashmi, hot foods that included deep fried oysters and peking duck, as well as the tasty noodles made in-house. The dinner price is a bit on the pricey side but if you can eat a lot, it's well worth the money then. I also liked the fact that the food was constantly replenished, so wait times for refills were short. The lineup process I cannot fault the restaurant as it is more of an issue of the people eating there as I noticed several individuals cutting in line and pushing through. I think it bothered me moreso because I have children and when people push, I immediately push back. Nonetheless, the atmosphere is like any other buffet. Four stars for the food and service, one star for the behaviour of the other people eating there who don't understand the concept of waiting in line for your food."}
{"text":"What a great place, the food is fresh and they have some great foods to select from, even frog legs which were amazing.  The sushi table is nuts with a tonne of selection, the decor is very authentic ancient chinese feeling.  They even had authentic chinese entertainment , unfortunately I couldn't understand it all, but it felt like little china in this place"}
{"text":"everything was very good.  some dishes were extremely fatty specifically the peking duck  apparently the wonton is to die for especially with the way my brother was going through it,   sashimi was good but the maki rolls are not  the fruit is fresh and when in season, they do offer some of the sweetest selections  service could be better but i guess that's just because it's so busy all the time"}
{"text":"Sashimi, Peking duck and a robot noodle chef!! This Buffet was worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"We've been twice, once for lunch (Tuesday special) and once for dinner (normal weekday).  I would never recommend the Tuesday special to anybody - the place is super busy, the lines are long, we had to share a table, the food was not that great and always seemed to be totally gone, and our server was super busy too. But hey, it's $11.99 and the robot will cut you fresh green (spinach, I think?) noodles.   The dinner was much better. Peking duck was available - a server put it onto the plate for you with the thin little wrappers, and you added your own sauce, cucumber, and green onion. The fresh noodle line was much shorter. There's a lot of sushi, even some sort of fruits-in-rice-paper that tasted dessert-ish, and there's even sashimi available! Oh, and there's someone cutting you roast beef at another station. Needless to say, the selection is much greater, and I think tastier too. Service was great; we were a huge table with 12+ people, and our server was super attentive.   So, recap: Tuesday lunch is cheap and the quality seems lowered to match, but a lot of that is a direct result of everyone going for the cheap lunch - so it's your call. Dinner is great. Service is always awesome!"}
{"text":"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE  I had lunch there a few months ago and won a free lunch with one of those scratch cards given at the end of the meal.  Today I went there with a friend to try to redeem my prize.  In their email, it says to \"show the Redeem Code\" and the email to the staff to claim the prize, which I did.  The front staff told me I needed the original scratch card instead to claim the prize.  Nowhere in the email does it say to bring the scratch card.  I do not understand why the instructions given to the customer in the email say one thing and when I got there there was a different requirement.  I brought this to the attention of the manager, Mr. M.H., and he offered no help at all.  He would not even acknowledge the instructions to claim the prize are inconsistent and made no effort to rectify their own flawed system.  Instead, his attitude was completely dismissive and not one bit apologetic.  If you think customer service matters, please DO NOT visit this place."}
{"text":"This is a sister restaurant with Pearl Dragon.  The décor is very much the same with extremely high back chair, wooden frame and red in color.  But here I didn't see the zodiac heads imitation from the Summer Palace of Beijing nor any lobster during the weekend.  Servers will talk to you either in English, Mandarin or Cantonese.  Restricted distribution is on Peking Duck and sashimi.  The main cold dish is the King Crab.  Although each is long and meaty, it has not been defrosted enough so when you are eating, ice water keeps on running out.  There are fried Chinese oysters.  They are large, succulent and yummy.   Even so, please limit yourself for your cholesterol watch.  There are fried frog legs.  Big king oyster mushroom.  There are lot of grilled items.  The squash and fake fins soup got just too much starch in it.  Once leave it there on the table, it becomes gluey and sticky.  The roast beef looks very dry and did not try.  The dim sum is very average and do not have too much expectation.  The Peking duck is served with wrap and onion and depends on how many people lining up, we got a dish of 4 pieces.    The steamed fish is very fresh.  A huge counter is for Japanese foods.  Sashimi include salmon, butterfish and tuna.  Each piece is thick, big and fresh - one of the highest quality amongst AYCE restaurants.    Just too full to try anything.   The only dessert is the ginger milk custard which tastes good.  Tea is served in a very nice transparent round ball tea cup and the tea is heated on a candle stand.  There are 2 huge TV that repeatedly broadcasting a singing video.  There are only 2 seating reservation at 5:30pm and 7:30pm.  If you book for the later reservation, be sure to arrive on time or else the restaurant is close at 9:30pm and you may not have enough time to chat and eat.  Any other time you can come and line up for your table.  I can see that the cost of materials are picked to be on the expensive end.  That's why it is one of the most expensive AYCE restaurant.  For weekend, it costs $29.99.  Now the restaurant is having a lucky draw.  Each customer will have a chance to enter the distributed code and email will be send to you to claim the prize.  It includes iPhone, free meal, free tea and so on.  If you want to be a VIP, you can buy a membership to have your Birthday month free for a maximum of 2 persons for consecutive 2 years and 10% during regular patronage."}
{"text":"I've been to a few buffet and this is probably the best one yet. My family and I always come here whenever we have a celebration for something. This place is tidy, clean, pretty and big. They have different variety of food that you can choose from which is uneasy to try out every single thing because you'll be so full !"}
{"text":"My son decided to come here for my his birthday yesterday. We've been here before and the kids are usually pretty happy. My daughter loves the Peking duck and my son loves the wide selection of desserts. A server named Jenny was wonderful. What a treat it was to have her help us and made us feel welcomed. She sang happy birthday to my son. She surprised him with birthday hat and a heart shaped cake on a decorated plate. Never had that kind of treatment there before so it was really nice of her to make him feel special on his day. FYI some buffets give free dinner to the birthday recipient but at this location the hostess told me that it's only valid if you have at least 4 paying adults. So if you're going to celebrate a birthday keep that in mind."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi/sashimi and Peking duck fan and Dragon Legend hits the perfect spot!  The Peking duck is tender and crispy and the best I have tried in an ayce!   For the sushi/sashimi: 1. Salmon was fatty and tasty. They also have salmon belly, which is even fattier! More omega-3s :) 2. Butter fish was as the name say, buttery!  They have a Tuesday special so if you are going on a weekday, choose Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Prices have increased by $1.00 but the quality has gone down from when it opened.  Flavor was buffet quality and the choices seem to have been reduced.  The only choice for seafood was a fish dish.  The flavor of the sushi just basic now, compared to when the opened which was very fresh with good flavor.     When originally opened, the food and  variety here was very good.  It seems they have cut back on quality and variety.  Service - good."}
{"text":"Dragon Legend is a Chinese Buffet that has a huge variety. From sushi, to fried chicken and fries, to Peking duck, Dragon Legend is sure to have something that you fancy, and then some. It is a bit pricey, but if you want to spend a little more than your usual restaurant, then dragon legend is somewhere you should definitely try. I would say the Peking duck is one of the best things you can get there, the duck is cut and your order is made right in front of you. They also have great chicken options such as General Tao, sweet and sour, lemon, and sesame chicken. All of which are delicious. Most buffet restaurants have a really good dinner and a so-so lunch but dragon legends is a good choice for both!"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else about the fantastic food and highlights. Just wanted to point out one of the most impressive features is the staff patrolling the buffet and  calling in orders via headset to the kitchen for dishes needing to be replaced. Makes no wonder the food quality is so high."}
{"text":"This is probably my third time here, but I think they're going down hill.  We went on Friday night and the first thing we noticed was how many empty seats they had.  We were expecting line up but there was no line up.  The part that they're really going down hill on quality is the grill section, everything there seemed dry and looked like they've been sitting there for a while.  This part definitely needed some improvement.  The good part was the unlimited oysters and peking duck, they're both really good.  The duck seemed to be roasted perfectly and the oysters were fresh.  The sushi section was good but I wish they had more fancier specialty rolls.  Although the salmon sashimi seemed really fresh that night, you could tell usually by the color.  I would still return to this place, sometimes I crave for buffet but they have things to improve on.  Not sure if they've increased the price, but 3 people on Friday night came to $130 after everything which seems a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Unique experience. Glad we came. I tried a lot of things I would not have tried if it were not on a buffet. That's the fun of buffets, you can be adventurous with out recourse. The atmosphere was fun but not enough foods I liked to go again without friends. Probably a good place for a group. I enjoyed the spectacle of it all. The ice cream bar was nice."}
{"text":"HUGE buffet with high end features like Peking duck, grilled squid, oysters, short ribs, dim sum, sushi, maki rolls, sashimi (albacore, salmon, shrimp), huge dessert bar, and more. It is a higher priced buffet at $32.99 pp, and it gets very busy.  The interior is quite large, and ornately decorated with sculptures, lanterns, light features, fountains, etc.  It is festive and adds a sense of celebration to the experience. Parking gets filled up fast."}
{"text":"Came here for Wednesday night dinner buffet. The place was pretty busy for a Wednesday but I think it was because it was Mother's Day week so everyone was bringing their mamas for dinner. There was nothing outstanding about the food at this place. They had one or two good items like the hand pulled noodles in soup and the sashimi but everything else was just ok. Even the desserts, while there were lots to choose from, was really nothing special taste wise. The decor of this place is rather elaborate and interesting with some wooden chairs literally towering over people. For the price, I probably wouldn't come back as the food was really nothing special. I'd rather save my money to eat somewhere of better quality, even if I don't get the variety that one would get at dragon legend."}
{"text":"By far my favourite buffet. Great selection of tasty food. The handmade noodles with fish broth was very nice and refreshing. Lots to like about this place, but most important of all: unlimited Peking duck."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. They try so hard to copy dragon pearl buffet but I find it a bit tacky. The dining areas are big but the buffet area is soooo small. It's always crowded because there's absolutely no space.  Also I notice the rooms have no sound proofing at all. Another design flaw for such big rooms with elegant theme."}
{"text":"Love it. This has to be the beat ayce Asian food They have hand made noodle soup very good . They had suchi not bad for buffet.  I enjoyed the grilled mackerel.  Huge breaded chicken wings a bit greasy but that's the way Asian wings are. Lots of fresh fruit and deserts . Let's talk about the decor is a 10/10 Wow its perfect I have never seen nothing like it. If you want all you can you this place is a must. Great service."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, love the designs and the food selection! A little pricey but it's worth it every once in awhile!"}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I have ever been to. Very large selection with oysters, crab legs, lobster, peking duck on certain days. They have dragon fruit for dessert. Their wine oxtail is also very good but with large selection, also comes with expensive pricing. One person is $36.99 and even a toddler under 2 has to pay $2.99."}
{"text":"I come here a couple times a year to celebrate special occasions with family. Always for dinner as they have better food. The selection is very large however the selection of good dishes are spare.   Whenever I go it's just eating their prime rib, sashimi, Peking duck and desserts. They only let you have 3 pieces of sashimi at a time and a small amount of Peking duck, as well as 1 slice of prime rib at a time. Sounds ridiculous when they're charging so much. EVEN mandarin doesn't do that.   Their other dishes are not very good, other meat dishes are hard and chewy. The rest of the dishes are coated in oil and MSG or deep fried.   Their deserts are less sweet than usual to cater to the Chinese taste. However they have one or two dessert dishes that have normal sweetness that I enjoy. The mini squares of cake/brownie are good.  Most of the cake taste bland, even the jello is tasteless. The fruit are all not sweet, watermelon, cantaloupe etc.   For the price you pay, you might as well just go to a high end Chinese dinner banquets hall. It would cost the same and taste 10x better."}
{"text":"I came here with a dinner reservation for 5 on a Saturday night, and we still had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. It's frustrating to see five 'hostesses' crowding around one reception stand trying to seat people in queue. Even if you have a reservation, you still need to get in line with the others.   Aside from the frustrating wait, Dragon Legend is also one of the pricier buffets I've been to (over $30 per person). There's good variety in the sushi and sashimi section, including bonito, salmon, white tuna, hamachi and egg sushi. There's also a noodle station with a chef making fresh hand-cut noodles. They give you a small bowl, so ask for double if you like - you pick the type of broth and either BBQ duck or pork as your topping.   The section I would skip is the dim sum section - tiny shrimp dumplings didn't look too appetizing with steamed buns that were already soggy. The peking duck wrap is nice and small - worth a try since not every buffet offers this dish. The steak and meat selection all looked very dry, so I didn't bother getting any.   The dessert is not bad - fresh waffles are consistently refilled and creme brulee is made in front of you. Sugarless options are also offered. The fruit selection consisted of only watermelon, pineapple, melons, strawberries and frozen grapes. They were all surprisingly sweet!   Overall, Dragon Legend is not bad but not worth $30 per person."}
{"text":"We went there for weekend lunch. The peking duck, sashimi, rolls, roast beef, fruits, and desserts are really good. Service was ok."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Chinese buffet.  The food is excellent, the pricing (especially lunch) is very reasonable.   The buffet is large and always being maintained.   The staff was kind and attentive.  I highly recommend if you are in the Markham area to try out!!"}
{"text":"Great job as an AYCE dinner buffet! Except deep-fried dishes, their chinese seafood dishes are superb. Best Peking duck ever. Freshly pulled noodles are boiled on order at noodle bar. Authentic chinese desserts were impressive. Nice service and decor in a gigantic dining room. Two thumbs up from those skeptics about Chinese buffet dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place. All you can eat pekin duck. Everything is yummy its a super busy place. We are from montreal and would of killed to have a dragon legend here."}
{"text":"I've been here many times because my family keeps choosing this place for birthdays and get-togethers. They like that there's plenty of choices so everybody finds something to eat, including picky children.   I prefer dinner here because they serve peking duck at night. There's a fresh dragon noodle station, and lots of traditional Chinese dishes. They have a small dim sum station. My family likes the various sea food options they serve, including crab legs at the cold bar. They have sushi as well; the sashimi is served to you by someone behind the counter but you can grab the maki and nigiri yourself.   The dessert station has a decent selection, which included a sugar free cake amongst the other baked goods the last time I went there. There are cookies and waffles and ice cream and Nanaimo bars. There's fresh fruit at the cold bar.  The place is mainly decorated in black, red and gold. Currently, there's a giant Christmas bear that gives hugs to take pictures with at the front. Come here if you don't want the headache of trying to choose a place with food everybody can agree on. And for the peking duck."}
{"text":"I am a self acclaimed expert seeing as I was brought up in a family which always ran some sort of restaurant so here is my review.  First off let me say that I love all you can eat restaurants so I am very sad to give this such a low score.  The quality of this place really went down the drain, this was the third time visiting Dragon Legend and I never remembered there being so few choices compared to other ayce buffets.  The only dishes of real quality were... The Peking duck(which some people won't even eat), the sesame chicken, the chicken mushroom soup and the fruits...  I'm sorry dragon legend... But you should step up your game. And for you people looking if you should go to this place. Try dragon pearl near York mills and Don mills. I went there not too long ago and it was still well kept!"}
{"text":"Was here to try their weekend dinner buffet, even more disappointed than last time, more expensive but not more food, the only thing extra was crab leg. Quality gone way down the hill, i don't think I will be back any time soon for their dinner buffet, for lunch may be. I don't understand why we don't have a half decent Vegas style buffet restaurant in GTA."}
{"text":"It's a great buffet! Huge selection. Really high quality sashimi... Love the Peking duck... It's my favourite buffet!"}
{"text":"Dragon Legend is an above average buffet with an above average price tag and truly impressive decor.  This place is huge and if it's your first time here and you have a table in the corner, you'll likely get lost more than once on your way to and from the buffet.  They have plenty of tables here but I feel this is a great place for small-medium parties but less so for big parties.  For families of over 12 people, they seat you at this huge oval table which is so large that you cannot actually talk to anyone that's not beside you.    I'm not crazy about AYCE places mostly because I never eat enough for it to be worth it.  That being said, I do target the more expensive food so that i can get my money's worth.  Small selection of sashimi, and you're not allowed to get more than a few pieces of salmon/shrimp at once.  I find this very annoying because my family and I will often get food for each other.  It's very ironic that they don't allow each customer to grab a few more pieces of salmon but will allow them to grab unlimited number of specialty soup (some sort of ginger herbal soup) at once, especially since the specialty soup may take up to 20 mins to heat.  The limit on sashimi alone ruins my experience here.    The sushi and chinese dishes were not impressive, though the peking duck is absolutely the highlight.  There's a bit of a line up and each person is allowed 2 per plate, then you can go to the side and add your own sauce etc.  The staff here are quite attentive and our plates do get cleared often enough."}
{"text":"Very busy place with not enough parking! Food is pretty good, especially considering this is a buffet. They've got a good variety of Japanese sushi and Chinese food. There's also a very cool robot that makes noodles automatically.  Tuesday's are the day to go as dinner prices are just $22 Canadian dollars for adults. Be warned about the lack of parking though! Decide is top notch. Good selection of soups, foods off the grill, fried finger foods, desserts.   I wish I could give 3.5 stars.....3 will do for now. My family didn't enjoy this place much."}
{"text":"I had a sudden craving for buffet and wanted a change of scenery from the typical place I go to (aka Mandarin lol don't judge).   Heard good things from my friends who have been here before and couldn't wait to try it out. Saved a big appetite for the big day and idk I feel a little conflicted about my whole experience. I mean it was great, don't get me wrong, but I couldn't bring myself to get 2nd's of anything else once I tried everything I wanted to (maybe I was just feeling off that day).   Anyways, the buffet has a great selection of Asian dishes such as peking duck, siu mai and their own little noodle station. The sashimi was also surprisingly good for a buffet, so much so that they limit your amount to only 2 salmon, 2 butterfish and 2 of the other sashimi each time you go.   The desserts were great and extremely tempting since I would pass by it to go to my table each time haha. I didn't get to try the ice cream though, but there weren't many flavors and it's just ice cream after all.   All in all, I'd recommend this place if you guys haven't been and I can't wait to come back some day!"}
{"text":"Great dinner on Friday night! - Plump juicy raw oysters, the best part, no line up!!  - Great assortment of sashimi (hamachi, sweet shrimp, butter fish, salmon) - Peking Duck (though the wrap was a bit too thick) - Noodle Station - Hot individual steamed soups  Those were my fav items.  I think the value surpasses jap buffets, service was fine but don't expect too much.  Communal washroom sinks are a bit odd.  Overall decor and ambience is good."}
{"text":"It's a good buffet for the price and since we're using American currency the exchange was favorable to us. I was disappointed not to see any crab legs or lobster at this buffet but was pleased with the food overall. It is a massive dining hall decked out in Chinese dragons and lanterns. We had their peking duck it was really good. They had all noodle bar with hand made noodles done by a person and a robot it is really interesting, Their noodle bar is fabulous you can pick the type of noodles to the type of broth and give you a steamed dumpling that is very tasty. Desserts are good many things to chose from and i liked their selection with some sweet tofu soup delicious. Service was fine nothing that great but it was fast and they cleared our plates right away. I would come back again if I wanted to pig out on pekking duck and sushi!"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese buffets go, this is above average place you can take your visiting over-seas relatives to. The decor is dark yet romantically lit and moody, and immediately made me feel like I am being hosted by Chinese royalty. Service is fast and friendly and they accommodated us by adding an extra seat to our table when we requested it.   The buffet area is decent sized. Due to it being a Chinese buffet, you will naturally find many of the typical dishes offered at most buffets, including your stir fries, fried crispy items, terriyakis, grilled/roasts, sushi rolls, seafood, salads, soups, and dessert. As a big fan of dumplings, dim sum and roasted/grilled meats, I was kept very happy during my stay. The sushi was also pretty good.  The price is not inexpensive but not over the top either. It pays for the quality of food, service, and decor.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the restaurant! Can't wait to come back tomorrow night with my family!  Table for 15. Last name Truong. Yeah!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better buffets! Decor is very nice,  and the layout is very easy to follow Most of their dishes are excellent. Fresh noodles and sashimi always make me a happy camper.  Knocked off a star because did not have as much selection as other big buffets like mandarin"}
{"text":"Came here before when they first opened and I really think their quality/variety has significantly decreased. I don't really understand why this place is so popular--it was packed on Christmas Eve. Everything was extremely mediocre and not worth the price. I've never eaten so little sashimi at an all you can eat place--it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"For any of my fellow GTA Caucasian pals who believe heading to the Mandarin is the bees knees of Chinese/Asian fusion buffet dining, hear my now and listen to me later....  Dragon Legend is the new standard in quality Asian Fusion buffet! If Mandarin is the bees knees than Dragon Legend is the Wing of the Dragon that literally destroys the tiny insignificant bee. As I mentioned in my tip, DL is the combination.. nay.. the MEGAZORD of Asian cuisine, pulling together the very best of Dim Sum (Har gow, Sui Mai dumplings, etc), sushi (rolls, sashimi, etc), grilled meats (Beef ribs, chopped sirloin, etc), Chinese restaurant staples (Cantonese Chow Mein, sweet/ sour pork, fried rice), desserts, anddddd REPEAT!  *ENB - Even the salmon and RED tuna sashimi is AYCE and the cuts are thick. The only restriction is that you can only have 2 pieces of Tuna and 3 Salmon at a time. That's OK, I'll use the walk to and from my table to make more room - who is winning that bet.  I used to subscribe to the logic that when visiting a Chinese buffet, one must come equipped with what I like to call \"Mandarin pants.\" Basically a comfortable sweat pant material with minimal food and coffee stain-age that expands and grows as you do. Mandarin pants no more, after making a pig of myself recent at DL I'm going to upgrade (or downgrade if we're talking about my self confidence) to the Dragon Legend Moo-Moo, a full length flowing garment that drapes over your rapidly expanding form. No restrictions. No Problem.  Now I say all this in jest, this is a classy joint so you're gonna have to step your dress up a notch or two and figure out a way to fit 5 plates of food in while wearing nice jeans and a button up shirt. ESPECIALLY, when you're dining at a 20 foot table with 7 foot high chair backs OR when dining in the bow of an ancient Chinese boat (both set elegantly in the dining room).  AYCE anywhere is always a challenge and a treat but DL makes it so much more enjoyable.    Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Food is fare . Price is fare. Good for a casual business lunch. Don't really enjoy it ."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant if I want buffet. LOTS of variety! The food quality is alot better than most buffet places. From Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Western.. they have it all. Prime rib, crab legs/oysters, Peking duck and sashimi are probably the highlights. Food is always replenished. Servers are quick and generally nice. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants to have a buffet style meal."}
{"text":"This place would have been 4 stars at least, for the ambience, peking duck and fried oysters.  But on our last visit Nov. 2016, the fried oysters were no longer the plump juicy kind, instead they were the small kind you'd find packed into a bucket.  More fried dough than oyster.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. This is basically a more expensive version of Mandarin Buffet. I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had company Xmas lunch and for most it was their first time.  Decor was unique. We were seated with the big tall chairs, which made for a laugh.  Different from the Mandarin. Some prefer mandarin, some enjoyed the change.   Service was good. Cleared dishes almost immediately. Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible.   They has salmon & butterfish Sushimi, but they served it and were a bit stingy. Only gave 3 pieces salmon & 2butterfish, and when I asked for more (on the same plate) they gave me 1 salmon.  They did have a nice selection of sushi in general.   Peking duck was a nice surprise. Noodle station was good and fun to watch them hand pull the noodles. Had no problem getting a 2nd dumpling added to my bowls. Spicy beef broth was good, but on the salty side.   Overall enjoyed the selection of foods. Quality was a bit higher than Mandarin, however felt not as many different selections. Trade one thing for another, but would definitely go back with the family.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Peking Duck and sushi were excellent!  Mussels, bbq pork, shrimp and pork dumplings and chocolate ice-cream are good!  The servers were also very polite."}
{"text":"Came here for their Tuesday dinner special $20.99. A very fair price for what you get! Let's begin with atmosphere.. A bit noisy because there are barely any materials in the dining room that absorbs noise. The decoration is beautiful, a bit on the darker side. Lots of red and black color schemes for good luck I'm guessing.  The food. What caught my attention was the Peking duck station. Two servers cut and served the Peking duck fresh. Meat portions were generous with a good amount of meat and fat. Sushi selection was good. Their salmon was very good for a buffet. It was he fatty belly part of the salmon. The noodle station was also unique. It had a Chinese flare to it. A famous long single strand noodle that went on forever. The noodles also came with BBQ of your choice. Dessert was GREAT!! LOTS AND LOTS of selection and really fresh.. They had strawberries as fruits even :)! My favorite part was the green tea ice cream! AYCE green tea ice cream!   Lastly, service. Service was phenomenal for a buffet styled restaurant. It could be that my server was especially attentive but wow, most of the time I don't even get this at regular restaurants. She was extremely attentive and didn't just come to check on us once or twice but came at least four or five times to check on our hot water, food and overall experience. She even started conversations with us! It was a busy night too. So this was very surprising :)! I will be back!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've gone to a Chinese buffet, to the point that the places I remember don't operate anymore. I really didn't have any expectations for the food, the atmosphere, or the price. My party of 20 successfully made a reservation for Sunday lunch and on the day of the tables were set and ready for us. I was pleased to find Dragon Legend well decorated and very clean on first impression. The interior of the restaurant actually quite a lot of seating available for large and small groups as well as three VIP rooms to the side available for larger groups might want some privacy. The main dining area has two large projectors showing classical Chinese cuisine videos. The actual area with the food is quite small but that is quite nice because you get to see at a glance all your options available, there are a number of different foods that you could go to such as the Peking duck station the noodle bar, the sashimi station, and the roast beef station. Depending on the day of the week and whether you go for lunch or dinner, availability of items may change. Sunday lunch has a decent variety of options - nothing too heavy and enough variety for us to feel like it was worth $22 per person that we paid.  The stations that I mentioned are manned by someone at all times, meaning it is not all self serve. The advantage of this is that people are limited to how much they can take and the food is kept in a sanitary and organized state. For example, only five pieces of sashimi are given each time on a plate so you'll have to frequent the station if you want more - there is no limit to how many times you go to the station. Seems a bit inconvenient, but definitely encourages trying out more variety and not wasting food.  Things to definitely try are their Peking roast duck and the noodle bar. The roast duck is generously sliced and the tortilla-like wraps are thin. In addition to the regular cucumber and spring onion toppings they also have crunchy taro bits - kind of like Hickory Sticks - which add texture and flavour. The noodle bar has a lot of variety and may seem confusing, but the noodles are green and purple due to added vegetables in the noodle, and you can choose which soup base as well as which meat to put in. Soup bases include chicken broth, fish soup, and some other bone-based soup. Meats included charsiu, pork dumpling, chicken I believe -there's signs with English and Chinese to choose from. The portion is just the right amount to give the noodles a try, but not fill you up so you cannot enjoy the rest of the buffet.   If you're looking for something traditional and not too filling, grab a bowl of longevity soup. With all the fixings of Chinese soup, the flavour is good and yet the soup is translucent and not oily. The soup will be like another cup or two of tea so it won't eat up your appetite.   The station to skip for me would be the ice cream, a bit disappointing. I was excited to find they have black sesame and green tea ice cream, as well as chocolate strawberry and sugar-free cappuccino. They had cones or bowls, and sundae toppings available. You can even DIY and get fruit from the salad bar, the beauty of a self-serve buffet. Unfortunately the ice cream was somewhere between hard and soft ice cream - a bit odd, and the texture suggested a very low-quality, air-filled ice cream. The flavours were more promising by name than actual taste so a few spoons in I was ready to give up. There are other dessert options as they have a full table devoted to cakes and pastries, but don't have too high of expectations there either. The cakes were average and much of the table suffers from sitting out for a bit too long, especially if you're a patron looking to maximize your stay until last call.  Overall, the lunch meal was acceptable in price for the quality of the meal - definitely a large variety of options and overall everything was acceptable in taste and freshness. The price is much too high for dinner, no matter what special items they offer (there would probably be lineups anyway). It was good to see that there were still specialty stations open for lunchtime, and I would probably come back for a similar large gathering since there's something for everyone and saves me brainstorming restaurant options. Further bonus was there was no cake-cutting/plating fee - we brought a small cake for the birthday boy and it was taken away for fridge storage with no trouble at all."}
{"text":"Came here twice in the span of two weeks and experienced both the weekday dinner buffet and the weekend dinner buffet. I personally loved the weekend buffet more just because of the scallop sashimi, but of course that does come with a price tag. Here are a few items that I LOVED from here: - Brown Sugar Cake (dim sum section) -scallop sashimi (weekend only!)- 2 per round, but SOO fresh and sweet -all of their specialty sushi rolls -made to order sirloin steak cubes -bbq goose noodles (made to order)- ps the english menu messed up and wrote bbq pork twice. Just know that goose is an option. -bbq pork Overall I was truly impressed with this place. Most buffet places offer a lot of food, but at mediocre quality. Here, their sushi beats many AYCE sushi places out there right now and offers extremely fresh sashimi to boot. Their dim sum, as good, if not better than, many existing Chinese places already out there. (In addition to the brown sugar cake, their vegetable shrimp dumpling not only looks beautiful, but also has thin chew skin that doesn't stick to your teeth!). In fact, most of their items on their own can definitely hold their ground against many existing Chinese restaurants that I have visited.  Moreover, service here was also attentive and excellent. At other buffets I've been to, those serving the food usually look cranky and act as if I'm a bother to them when I request something. Here, there's workers happily asking me if I want steak, and whether I wanted an extra piece of goose with my noodles, all of which was done with a smile!  Only gripe: the desserts. Nothing exceptional or memorable. It was nice that they had sesame ice cream though, and the waffle was surprisingly fresh.  As for price, yes it is expensive. But if you consider the quality of food, the service, the atmosphere (aka the overhead costs for the restaurant, which at this size must be fairly sizable), the price is understandable.   Overall, fantastic buffet, especially for large groups! Recommend, but for special occasions only due to the steep price"}
{"text":"Shaved spinach noodle soup with chicken broth and green onions and cilantro is the best. Why can't someone open an restaurant that sells noodle soup like they do?  Weekends are pricey at $32 but they have Peking duck which is awesome. Someone serves it to you four at a time. On weekends, they also have premium sashimi like ebi, toro or hamachi.   Waffles with whipped cream and blueberries are awesome too.  Make a reservation. Esp on the weekends. Also on Tuesday's, the meal is cheaper per person. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Would actually give this 3.5 stars if I could! I came here for the first time tonight with my boyfriend and his family. I've been to the sister restaurant, Dragon Pearl. Both restaurants have the same ancient Chinese decor and serve more or less the same type of food, although I felt that this one had more to choose from.  They have a noodle bar (hand sliced noodles with your choice of soup), sushi bar with a variety of sushi, rolls, and sashimi (scallop is decent!), salad bar, and lots of Asian dishes you would expect to see at a Chinese buffet. There's also a variety of ice cream and desserts.  I spent most of the night munching on Peking duck and cold crab legs, which I personally thought were the best items this buffet has to offer.  For the steep price of ~$30, I probably won't be back anytime soon. There just weren't enough dishes that I gravitated towards to justify it."}
{"text":"This is certainly the coolest Dim Sum restaurant I ever stepped into. Although it is clearly Chinese themed, It also feels a little Medieval.   First the GOOD:  - Not overcrowded like most dim sum places. And not as loud, tables are a good distance apart.  - Table settings well above average.  - Service was generally good but a little cold at times.  - Like the double sided tea cups - not too hot to hold. Fancy tea pots remain heated thanks to a candle underneath.   - Beautiful spotless washrooms  We ordered way too much food but some high level thoughts...  - 3 color shrimp & scallop dumpling - Pretty to look at, average taste.  - Shrimp and vegetable dumpling - Pretty to look at, average taste    - Mixed mushroom dumpling - good  - Chicken & chive dumplings - the standout of the meal  - Squid tentacles - kind of oily  - Stir fried rice noodle with shrimps and vegetables - good  - Steamed beef ball - no thanks  - Sesame balls with custard - good  - Lotus leaf sticky rice - good  And the Not so GOOD:  - It is pricier vs. most of the competition.   I enjoyed my experience at Dragon Legend and appreciated the attention to detail with respect to decor. Not my favourite dim sum in Markham but worth a visit every now and then.   BK"}
{"text":"This is a great place for people who are fans of traditional Chinese/Asian food and people who are a little shy of trying new things when it comes to Chinese/Asian food.  For a buffet they are a little higher end than most places, with beautifully decorated furniture and an overall nice atmosphere to eat in.  The place is usually packed to the brim, so a better idea may be to try this place on the weekend, when there are less people and more time to sit down and enjoy your food.  There will be a mass amount of people in line for sushi, noodles, ice cream, you name it so be prepared to rub elbows if you want to eat the good stuff.  The food is great and my personal favorite is the sashimi and sushi they have to offer.  The fish is fresh and the sushi is made on the spot and comes out rather quickly.  The cooked food is pretty good too, my personal favorites are the braised lamb,  Peking duck,  and made to order noodle bowls.   Save room for dessert as well as they have many choices to offer.  Everything from fresh fruits, tofu dessert, green tea iced cream, and cakes galore are available in large quantities.   My personal #1 dessert is building my own fresh waffles with fresh fruits and iced cream.  Overall a great place to go with friends or the family.   I will be coming back for more of those crab claws and Peking duck in the near future!"}
{"text":"After quite a bit if research my partner and I decided to hit up Dragon Legend for our annual holiday Chinese food fix. To go to a buffet seems to be a better idea than hot pot or traditional Chinese because there we only the two of us and we could sample many many dishes.  We arrived at 530 and were very glad we made a reservation. The place filled up very fast. The ambiance was quite neat with a Chinese language version of the food channel on a big screen. Great for working up the appetite  The food:  Really really exceptional amount of choice including Peking Duck, Noodle soups and all kinds of dishes. Everything was quite amazing except for the deep fried mussels (must be an acquired taste).  This place is a cut above some of the other buffets I've been to and really worth a trip to Markham."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a buffet.  The Tofu Pudding is so delicious!  Large assortment of dim sum items that were tasty, freshly grilled items and desserts.  I would highly recommend this place.  The service was decent and all of the food was tasty and fresh!  For $11.99 on Tuesdays at lunch, you cannot beat the price!"}
{"text":"This is an AYCE buffet with a very wide selection of Chinese and Asian foods.  Most such places end up being rather bland but this restaurant is an exception. Both the variety and the quality are impressive. The food is fresh and well made. The environment is high quality and festive.  If you expect exquisite and nuanced cuisine, don't go to a buffet. However, for a wide variety - you can bring a culturally diverse group here and they'll all fine things that they like - this place is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Great Asian Buffet, and a nice change from the usual Chinese food buffets that cater heavily to non-asian Canadian tastes.  We visited at lunch time, which features dim sum and sushi, along with a number of other dishes like peel and eat shrimp, mussels, General Tso chicken, etc.  A real treat is their hand-sliced noodle soup, especially the spicy beef noodle, featuring lots of hot chili oil, bouncy, al dente noodles, and loaded with both tender chunks of braised brisket and thinly sliced rare beef. You can even top it with a bit of char-siu pork or BBQ duck meat.  Other stand-outs were the 'ham sui gok' deep fried sweet-pork filled football dumplings, chinese eggplant in xo sauce, pan-fried pork dumplings, sauteed green beans, and their moist, tasty, deep fried chicken, which tasted exactly like it was a perfectly roasted bird.  Lunchtime is missing the Peking Duck, seafood, and freshly shucked oysters that make dinner special, of course, but our meal was delicious, especially for the low Tuesday-Lunch-Special price of only $14!  Lovely decor, great service, solid food, especially for a buffet, as well as sharing your lunch with lots of Asian grannies and grandpas, it was very nice.   I'm surprised I've never been here before, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"The desert section was so awesome! I had to try really hard to not eat everything. They have a noodle section where they make it in front of you. There are lots of varieties. All that for $16 for lunch.(went on a thursday) cheap and good for value."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is awesome. Decor is so fun and colourful, incredible selection of food, dumplings were cooked perfectly, lots of selection of sushi, desert bar was fantastic. The service was also great, we were seated right away and our waitress greeted us within 10 seconds of us being seated. Price was around $27 per person. Highly recommend and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I found everything fine. The variety is pretty good. I went there for a company lunch. It wasn't too busy so I didn't have to wait long in any line-ups at the food stations. What I tried was not bad. i would say that  the peking duck , sushi choices,  vegetable dishes, and meat were all good. I don't think there was anything outstanding. I think when people go to a buffet there eyes get bigger than their stomach. Me included. So feel everything was fine. The staff were very friendly and easy going. I would recommend it for a work lunch break or business lunch in. Or if you and your friends want to go somewhere with a lot of variety.  Don't expect it to be outstanding."}
{"text":"Been there twice so far. The first time was for lunch in this summer, maybe we went there too early, they wasn't well-prepared, the food was dry and poor quality, which didn't leave me a positive impression.  Then I went there for the second time last night, it was for our company's holiday party. The food quality was much better than my last time, perhaps because it's business peak. The service was great too. We had the 100 guests room, which is spacious and we were able to social and play games. They have microphones, projector and canvas screen available in that room too, perfect for big events like ours.  Overall a good place. Will go again."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner in Saturday night and have never had a buffet like this before. First, when you walk in the decor will really take your breathe away. I found the attention to detail to be top notch - from the glass teapots with tea light candle to keep them warm to the variety of seating arrangements (huge family style tables or big benches), it was very impressive.   Now for the most important part - the food! The buffet had the traditional sort of items like stir fried sweet and sour and fried rice, but there was also pumpkin shark fin soup and hand pulled noodle soups. The dim sums were really fresh - the best I have had at a buffet! There was also an area for grilled shrimp on a stick, Peking duck and steak as well as sushi. I was a bit disappointed with the sushi selection since I prefer cooked sushi, but DH said all the fish from this area was really fresh. There was also an excellent dessert selection of which I ate too much of. I had green tea and mango ice creams, creme brûlée, 2 types of pastries and green tea mousse cake. I really should have stopped at the creme brûlée.    The minus one star is really for the price. There are so many places in the GTA to eat. While they may not have the ambiance, the 29.99 was a bit steep for us. Given that we don't live in the area, this would be a special occasion kind of place anyways, i.e. When we visit markham!"}
{"text":"Really hard to find parking! Street parking is allowed.  Food was passable but quite expensive. The potato pancake, fried dumplings, and hand carved noodles were tasty.   Peking duck was dry but ayce is pretty cool for that sort of food."}
{"text":"You're paying 40 bucks after tax and everything for AYCE Asian food. Now I'm writing this review based on other AYCE that I've ate too. I think this is reasonably price based on several factors:  The variety  The venue Quality of some dishes    They got some Chinese soups, a salad bar, a seafood bar with crab legs, sushi bar (unlimited shrimp sashimi on weekends), Peking duck, dimsum, dessert bar and much more. They also have a cool station where you can try out their handmade potato or spinach noodles in your own selected soup (beef or fish)  The venue looks like some traditional legendary Chinese castle with red wooden chairs and tables. A VERY BIG VENUE  In AYCE you would kinda expect the food to be shittier than a la carte, but some of the dishes were actually good! I've discovered dishes that I like that I've never had before cause of the variety.   I do recommend this place, if you want to try it out."}
{"text":"Most of y'all who think Mandarin is the best Asian buffet in town, you fooling yourselves because there's a new restaurant in town and it's Dragon Legend.  This place has a great variety of different Asian foods from the fried eats to the dim sum and the sushi bar and an overloaded dessert bar I couldn't stay away from.  Did I mention they serve sesame ice cream at this spot, not many places do which is a treat.  If you plan on eating with friends or the family, skip Mandarin and head to Dragon Legend you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food and service is nice. The service staff is very courteous. They put water on the table and napkins"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. I love the medieval Asian decor of the place - everything from the chairs to the tables. The place is definitely a stunner.   The price is steep but I definitely enjoyed myself here. Everything from the Peking Duck to the noodles and the creme brulee desert. Some of the dishes can be a little too greasy but overall it was a great dining experience. The place CAN get overcrowded at times. I didn't enjoy the lineups to some of the stations.   This is definitely a more expensive and better alternative to Mandarin. Although it's a little too expensive for my blood, it's still a great place to come to for some fusion cuisine."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Especially the Peking Duck menu for the all you can eat menu. Worth the price to come only for the Peking Duck. Parking is great ......"}
{"text":"Because we are piggies, my family and I frequent AYCE sushi places.  This is by far my favourite buffet restaurant.  Excellent choice for family members who don't like eating raw fish as there is an extensive selection of cooked foods as well.  I find the quality of the food here is much better than other buffets.  Where can you get great sushi, sashimi AND delicious peiking duck?    The decor is also quite impressive.  We've also been to the sister restaurant dragon pearl and I much prefer dragon legend.  I recall not being impressed with the sushi there.    It does get extremely crowded and a bit of a zoo on weekends though so definitely make a reservation.  If you don't enjoy fighting through crowds to get your food then this probably isn't for you.  It kind of reminds me of my Vegas buffet experience.  I do like that they have someone serving the food on certain buffet stands so you don't have everyone dirty little paws touching the tongs and the food.    This place is also much pricier than other AYCE sushi places though.  29.99 per person for weekend dinner.  But as an added bonus they give you these lucky draw game cards and we scored a couple of free buffets out of it!    My only complaint is the last time we came it looks as though they went a little stingy on the sushi.  More rice and less fish in the rolls.  I hope this isn't going to be a trend of theirs.    Also came for lunch buffet with coworkers and found it wasn't that great...average buffet restaurant.  Not as busy so turnover isn't as fast so food sits out longer."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my coworkers and really, it's quite a deal for $15. There was actually a good range of sushi, which was quite good, and some dim sum options as well. They also had noodle soup made to order that I really enjoyed. My coworkers loved the desserts. Great selection, good service and very very tasty food, by buffet standards. The chicken wings on particular were fantastic.   We'll definitely go back, but we might walk as the parking lot is RAMMED all the time."}
{"text":"Oh buffets, why do you exist?  I read some of the reviews and I understand that everyone has their own experiences that lead to positive or negative, but compared to buffets and restaurants in general the food quality and taste is very good overall.  My buffet experience is one that dates back to my childhood Regina, Saskatchewan, where in the 80's my grandfather would take the family out to Bonanza Buffet. It was terrible. It was everything bad most people think of when they hear the word \"buffet\". Even now I remember a giant block of dry cheddar cheese , stale buns and over cooked, dry beef. The food was once good in it's prime, but alas, Bonanza got a hold of it and it somehow became the inedible stuff of culinary nightmares. Ever since my experience with Bonanza the trauma of those buffet meals has haunted me. I swore that nothing good could ever come from a buffet, until now.  To those that disagree with the food quality and taste of Dragon Legend let me just say that I base this off of my experience in life and in food. I might not be as well travelled as some nor had the super authentic food that you are comparing the foods at Dragon Legend to, but rest assured that I have tasted many foods and I believe I'm seasoned enough to judge some of the foods.  First let's start with the ambiance. Dragon Legend (and it's counterpart Dragon Pearl) has a massive space that after being led from the entranceway will surprise most at first. I recently brought a couple friends who visited Toronto here for lunch and they were shocked at how massive and overwhelming Dragon Legend is upon being led to our seats. There are colourful masks and lights, statues and grand chairs, seating areas that are inside Chines boats. The ambiance is daring and bold and in my opinion fantastic for a buffet experience.  There service is also fantastic, however for those seeking a consistent server experience you are out of luck. Plan on having quite a few different servers at your table either clearing away plates or refreshing your beverages.  Now on to the food. There are way too many delectable items for me to cover so I will go over a few based on my North American palate. The good: Chicken wings (and basically any chicken here) - I've had chicken at chicken restaurants that isn't this good. When I eat here the chicken has always been a sure thing. Sushi - I am not a seasoned sushi-file but I have had some bad sushi before and while this may not be comparable to top sushi and Japanese restaurants it is definitely not terrible by any means. I really enjoy the Hawaiian and California sushi here. Shrimp fried rice - This is always fresh and so tasty. Deep fried shrimp - I absolutely love their fried shrimp. I get these and grab some seafood sauce from where the fresh shrimps are and you have yourself a shrimp fest. Desserts - This is another area where I do have some expertise on and when I compare these desserts to those from other restaurants I am not comparing them to 5 star restaurants with $30 a piece desserts but the average desserts one has when they dine out. It's always hard to restrain myself when at the dessert bar at Dragon Legend. So many delicious items; from their chocolate cake to the créme brûlée, there is a lot to enjoy here and something for everyone. Try mixing stuff too and get creative. Chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and some chocolate sauce drizzled over it (sauce can be found at the dessert bar where the waffles are). Or some of the cheesecake with some of the fruit sauces drizzled onto it. The world is your oyster here!  The bad: The pizza - I don't know why they even put this out. I'm sure I have had it on one of my excursions here and it was tasty but the past couple times it seems like there is just one pizza cooked and thrown behind the prioritized foods. Just get rid of it Dragon Legend. No one is coming here for your pizza selection. The mushrooms - Soggy, tasteless and just seemed there was so much more that could have been done. Like add some garlic or anything for flavour. They're mushrooms, they aren't hard to make (maybe I'm basing this off of my own preferences when they might be aiming for a method of sautéing them that I have never had).  In conclusion and with all the good things I have to say about Dragon Legend (and Dragon Pearl) I am still not a massive fan of buffets. I recently went to Ottawa and tried out the Buffet Des Continents and for some bizarre reason it has a 3 star rating. Trust me, if the people who rated Dragon Legend with 3 or less stars ate at this buffet you would quickly rate Dragon Legend with 5 stars (oddly enough the one food I thought Buffet Des Continent did right was the pizza, but that's for another review).  Regardless of anyones take on buffets I always find it odd when someone will nitpick on a couple items at a buffet and then rate the whole buffet on these couple items. Is everything at Dragon Legend the best of the best? Well of course not, it's a buffet."}
{"text":"Better place than dragon pearl, it's sister restaurant. There are a lot of different kinds of seafoods, and crab legs on occasion. Their Peking duck is a great addition, and at times they will have lobster. They have a salad bar, and a grill. What you don't usually find is black sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"My go-to buffet with family and/or friends, since you can't go wrong with them. Well, unless you're trying to find a buffet with good parking - look elsewhere for that, or be ready to park on the street/across at other establishments at your own risk.  Decor is FANTASTIC, service is friendly but can be a little slow during peak hours, and food is constantly made. Favourites are always the sushi bar - spicy salmon and regular salmon sushi are always a safe and tasty pick. Sashimi can be a little on/off sometimes, but if you're lucky and go on a good day, it's fantastic (especially the butterfish and albacore). The roast beef counter is decent, though the cuts are small and sometimes cooked too well. Peking duck is also a nice option - at the end of the meal, have fun trying to fight for all the Creme Brulee's before they're all taken."}
{"text":"Been here 2x over the past two years and pretty much a standard Chinese and Japanese buffet spread. Typical Chinese entrees, a sushi and sashimi station, grilled meats and dessert area. Station serving Peking duck on wrap paper was always busy! Spacious dining areas with interesting decor. Price on upper range of buffet pricing. Not a bad meal but nothing outstanding either."}
{"text":"Came here for CNY dinner with my parents. We made a reso for 3 a week before and were seated within 5 mins of arriving. It was PACKED and a lot of people had to park on the side streets due to lack of parking.  The food was just as good as the last time I came here (when it first opened). Highlights are always the Peking duck, the chicken/mushroom soup, the hand sliced noodles, black sesame ice cream, fresh sushi/sashimi and the sheer variety of food they have. They've replaced the hand sliced noodles with a robot!   The price has gone up since they opened (of course). It's now $34.99 per person on Sat for dinner. I think that's still quite a good price for all the food you get there. The part that annoys me is if you order a pot of tea, it's $2.50 per person, which I think is a bit ridiculous.   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner. All the stuff we met were very friendly. I love the Peking duck. The sushi wasn't the best, but I think it's good enough for buffet. The only down part is the oyster, they only give you two each time. The interior was very cool. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I came here  twice for lunch, reasonable price and food is prefect. Variety of choice on from main to desert. Friendly service and unique dinner environment."}
{"text":"This is just like Dragon Pearl down at York Mills and Leslie. I would say better then mandarin. Similar idea but better ambience.  Please excuse the short review....I ATE too much...and now i dont have much motivation to do anything but just lay around like a sea lion...and after you are done with this place. You will feel just like me.  ITIS!"}
{"text":"As this was a buffet, my expectations were low. But I was greatly suprised. The first suprised was the friendly service. It was a hot day outside and we got to the buffet before 5pm, time at which they start.  We went in to check if they were opened and even though we were early they let us stay inside, were it was well refreshed with the AC. They also offered us glass of waters while we were waiting. That's really great service.  Second suprised was the food options. There are so many to select from. Sushi, Peking duck, stir fry, noodle soups, dim sum, grilled items. And they are all good. There was pig feet, which I don't see in Chinese buffet at home (maybe it's more authentic?) And then I saw fries, general tso chicken, chicken wing and gravy (so maybe not so authentic) regardless if it was authentic or not, you have to try everything when you come here and not be afraid. Only disappointment of the day was the kimchi. Not fermented enough, not spicy enough and too sweet.  Last thing to note is that when in an Asian buffet and out of what must be 150 people there are less than 10 non-asian people, it's a good sign."}
{"text":"I went to the Dragon Legend on Friday during lunch hour. Most tables were taken and there were some lines in front of noodle section and grill serving table. To be honest, the food they offer are really no difference than other typical Chinese buffet in north America, not bad but just ok.  The sushi are really tasteless, but for that price you can not expect much. The deserts and the ice cream were really below the average. But  i did find something I really enjoyed, such as red bean soup, hand made noodle with delicious chicken soup and spicy beef soup. The over all experience is ok, I will go there again."}
{"text":"This Chinese buffet is quite busy everyday. because of this, i don't always want to go.   Problems with the location  1) TERRIBLE PARKING. The parking lot is always full. If you know anything about Asian drivers, you will know that they are terrible drivers. I was stuck behind this guy outside for 10 minutes because he wouldn't move. I couldn't back up because there was someone behind me. He was waiting for a parking spot, and the person in the spot couldn't get out because there was a car blocking him.....It was terrible and I ended up parking on the road.   2) Washrooms are gross. When we went to the sink, there was chewed up food in it. It looked like someone threw up in the sink.   Good things about it.  1) The renovations were impressive.   2) Peking Duck was amazing. The sushi was fresh, but I had to keep going back because they restricted the amount you could take at one time.   3) The tofu dessert was great.   Overall, I might go again, but not on a busy night."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in Markham but still fits under buffet standards. There are a few better than average items but overall, it is quantity over quality.   On weekends they have more variety such as sweet shrimp sashimi, oysters, other seafoods and cajun style seafoods. On a weekday, the selections are still good/quite large but pretty standard oily buffet items.   Items I enjoy and always get: peking duck, longevity soup (the soup in the individual bowls), handmade noodles (the normal kind and spinach kind in the spicy or fish broth) and steamed egg in ginger juice.  - The salad bar and dimsum bar never appeals to me.  - I also always visit the sushi bar- sushi are ok... sashimi are pretty good usually.  - The iron griddle cooking station is good, and I recently discover they have 3A steak on demand cooked to your preference (definitely something I will continue to get!)  - Dessert area is good with a variety of cakes, jello, baked goods, ice cream and also dessert soups (the douhua/tofu fa is a hit or miss)  Definitely a great thing about Dragon Legend is the large selection of food that can accommodate everyone's picky tendencies. Service is good- they clear the table quickly. Lovely decor that really enhances the experience. It is expensive but you definitely pay for the variety and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I paid $10.99 for lunch buffet on a Tuesday. This has to be the best buffet I've ever had for lunch at this price range. The selection is very impressive for the price. I think even if it was a few dollars more I'd come. Their dinner prices are noticeably higher so maybe I won't go for that. I think the $10.99 price is a promotional price and won't last.   Most of the food is Chinese but they also have sushi and a wide range of western desserts. The sushi isn't really sushi. Most of it is maki (rolls). They do have hamachi rolls (yellow tail) which is not that common. For \"mains\" they have stir fried beef, lemon grass chicken, fried fish, sweet and sour pork, sesame chicken and of course fried rice. They have have things like white rice, fries etc to fill you up. Their chinese BBQ pork is top tier. It's mostly lean, and full of \"sweet\" flavor.   I love their noodle station. There's a line up because it's popular. You can customize with your choice of soup and even top it off with a piece of BBQ pork.   The decor at this place is noteworthy, even for a guy like me who typically doesn't care about decor. Service is ok. I'm not the type that needs to be pampered. The wait stuff will do their job without speaking to you. I'm fine with that. It's common for Chinese restaurants to not have much service aside from the basic.  Dinner is $30.99. Lunch was so good I'd almost consider shelling out this much money for a dinner buffet.   It IS a buffet. A lot of places go downhill and eventually fails. I hope this place stays."}
{"text":"This place don't disappoint. I've been coming here for many years now and they managed to keep up their standard. Not many places can do that.  I love their Peking duck.  I literally eat thr whole duck. Get my moneies worth right????   It is pretty expensive here but it's worth it in my opinion.  Their decoration is also really on point with the whole dragon and Asian theme. I really do like this place and they always have special and promo offers during the weekday so if you have a day off then make sure you come here and check it out.  They do have lunch on Tuesdays for 11.99 which is a good deal!!!   Would def come back here on another especially occasions."}
{"text":"We visited from out of town and was told this was a must visit place.  Arrived Sunday afternoon and got in just before the dinner crowd.  Huge thumbs up on the Peking duck carving station and the fresh noodles.  Didnt care for cold crab legs as I prefer them steamed hot.  Sushi was ok as I'm usually limited to salmon sashimi.  Did I mention good Peking duck?  That alone was worth price of admission as our family loves Peking duck.  Great dessert bar but we were too stuffed full of duck.  Did I mention there's Peking duck?  Just something we've never seen at any buffet on our travels."}
{"text":"Came here on mothers day for dinner because i've heard a lot of great reviews about the AYCE peking duck. Be aware that if you are coming on the weekend to make reservation ahead of time or you're looking at waiting for at least 30 minutes for a table. The restaurant itself is quite large with lot's of tables.  Food quality is standard for an ayce buffet. They had many varieties from western to japanese to asian cuisine. I was very excited for the AYCE peking duck and I thought it was standard. You can definitely get better peking duck from a regular chinese set course menu restaurant. I think you can tell the duck is not fresh.   Some highlight items/must gets: Sashimi (they will have someone serve you the sashimi as there is a limit for each order, but you can go back unlimited number of times if you want more), the deep fried oyster (take the breading out of the oyster and they're delish), the crab legs (very salty but quite meaty).  My fiance quite enjoyed the meaty dishes (chinese style fry chicken with the shrimp chip and beef cube dish with veggies). I also enjoyed the made to order noodle station as well.   Dessert : huge variety but definitely a must get is the sesame ice cream. Everyone always lines up for that one!   Service is good, they will clean up your dishes as needed and they will refill the items at the buffet quite quickly once they notice there is not much left.  Overall, would go back if you want variety but wouldn't want to go back often."}
{"text":"Went with my mom here on a weeknight and it was quite busy.  I give it 5 stars for the decor and atmosphere for a Chinese buffet restaurant.  Our server was not really friendly, but not rude.  Just nonchalant and wordless, when I asked for cutlery or the bill he simply just brought it without acknowledging that he either heard me or not.  Now onto the foods, I enjoyed the deep fried oysters and I'm not a oyster fan (ate about 4 that night), chicken wings were bland so I smothered them with ketchup, fries were cold, hot sour soup was excellent, grilled cod fish was very excellent there was always a lineup for it as it finishes fast.  I didn't touch the sushi (I never do at a buffet), nor am I a sweets dessert fan.  I didn't get my money's worth in the food but definitely did for the experience.  All together I still prefer Mandarin :)  My mom really enjoyed it for it's variety and this is definitely a much better quality buffet when it comes to Chinese buffets."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Chinese buffet I've been to. I wish they had this kind of buffet in Boston. There was a very extensive selection of authentic Asian food and it's impossible to try everything in one sitting. However, definitely get the handmade noodles (the spicy broth was very good!). The ambiance also made me feel like I was back home in China (they had those rotating glass disks on the tables!). I would definitely this to anyone craving authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Place was very nice but service could improve. Food was good but not much variety. Favorite part for me was the soy bean pudding! Love it!"}
{"text":"Above average ayce chinese buffet, but it is just way too crowded. A little bit pricy than the rest, but u got what u paid for."}
{"text":"For a buffet this place is pretty sweet.   Decor: this has got to be one of the most well decorated buffets I've been to, picture attached.   Food: It's got a decent spred of dim sum, canto/Beijing style food and sushi. And they have all you can eat Peking Duck. In terms of quality the food is pretty good for a buffet and in some cases better than some sushi and Chinese restaurants that I've been too  Price: typical buffet pricing    Overall: great experience and I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Average but lacking quality. Disappointed that there wasn't lobster, clams, and king crab legs. As well, they lacked fried noodles. Just very basic. They did however have a decent selection of sushi.   We came at 1:30pm, and was it ever busy. I think best to avoid the peak hours.  Overall a not so good experience. Their decor is a little more modern than others. Hopefully one day they'll have a great selection of seafood.   And here is what I really think:  I have a strong hate for buffets (at the time of writing I couldn't find a stronger word for hate), so I need to be truly impressed to give a marginal better than 2-star review.   For starters, the quality of the food was atrocious. The selection was sparse (feels like a soup kitchen has more variety). And to cap cap everything off, the crowd was just insane.   I was thinking, I paid to come here to fight with others for food? I can't see why they would have multiple food stations; other than the want to cut costs and to watch humanity at its worse - fighting for food while hungry.   For the cost of any buffet, one is always better off with full table service. You won't gorge yourself with trash and regret the next day and you'll feel much more civil. Paying that tip all of a sudden makes sense and you'll thank yourself for being so wise."}
{"text":"I would give the ambiance five stars, but this is brought down to an overall one by the food.  Buffets are never great to begin with, but this is the bottom of lot.  Cold, tasteless food, most of which is not prepared correctly.    Don't be fooled by the beautiful atmosphere.  This place spent everything on decor and left nothing to spend on food quality."}
{"text":"What can I say. I seriously can not come up with words for this place. It's relatively clean. Darker than most. The ambience in keeping with Chinese wood themes.   We came here with friends from England and this is not a big thing there so they wanted to try.  The thing that sets it apart from all the other Asian buffets, I feel would be the hand cut noodles. Dough is sliced thinly directly into the broth and cooked.  They offered beef flavoured, spinach and plain. The beef I guess wasn't really beef tasting cause my daughter asked to take it all out and leave the plain.  My nieces had the beef and spinach and said about the same. It's more for watching I guess than actual good flavour and taste. I was told the broth was nice.  I had mainly wings both deep fried and pan fried. Those were good. Not dry.  For dessert the really good one item (the star) was the ginger milk custard. It was set, but not over cooked. Amazing. If I were to go back it would be solely for that."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Dragon Legend!  Peking duck, crab legs, sashimi, oyster, soup. Everything is on point! I'm not sure why there are so many middling reviews of this place on Yelp, but the food was on fire today.   Service was excellent as well. Waiters were coming by often to pick up plates and offer drinks.   The price is the only contentious issue at +30 per person but with the quality and selection of food here, you're pretty much dining like a king!  A++! Great food. Great selection. Great service. Love!"}
{"text":"For the most part it's like any other Chinese buffet in terms of food offerings (90% similar). But what makes it different (stand out) than the rest would be the offering of Peking Duck Wrap, Hand Cut Noodle and the amazing decor. These three items alone deserve +1 star, compared to the rest. Keep in mind, crab leg and oyster are offered on weekends only.  It's not everyday you get Duck meat at a Chinese buffet.  Great for large groups! Spacious tables and seating."}
{"text":"Excellent and surprising restaurant in Markham, Ontario. It's the best Chinese buffet I had so far. You can get Peking duck, dumpling, sushi and much more there. The deco is also incredible. Huge resto often full. I come from Montreal and I recommend this resto."}
{"text":"This is an AYCE place, so keep that in mind: you have the advantage of a huge selection, but not the same fresh-cooked quality as if you had it prepared for you individually. So be aware of that, and my review takes into account the advantages and limitations of AYCE buffet places. Having said that, the food is very fresh and excellently prepared, in my opinion.   We had a small party of people with vastly differing palates. One of us liked authentic-style Chinese, another one preferred North American take-out style, while another diner would rather just eat pizza and prime rib. Dragon Legend did not disappoint, serving up Japanese, Chinese and Canadian foods skilfully prepared. They put out rather small portions, changing them frequently, which helps to keep the fresh taste. For an AYCE, Dragon Legend is surprisingly good!  The range of dishes is well-documented and photographed in other Yelp posts, but I would like to highlight the spicy seafood boil, which contained crab legs, crawfish, shrimp and mussels, as well as a mountain of chilled crab legs. Excellent soups and noodles as well. Also the desserts are great, in my opinion. Not too sweet but very comforting.   If you want to go on the weekend, my advice is to go really early, like 5:00 or 5:30 and call before you arrive. It gets insanely busy very quickly after 5:30. It`s a bit pricey, but considering the variety and quality, I think that it is a reasonable value.   The decor is over-the-top dramatic and spectacular, and the food selections are copious, visually overwhelming. It would be a great place for a special occasion, or to take folks from out of town. I'll be back, particularly when I am with a group of finicky eaters with very strong food preferences."}
{"text":"The place looks great but the food choice and quality is average for the price that you are paying. Biggest disappointment for me was the crab legs. It didn't seem fresh and it was super salty. Sashimi and the fresh noodles were good but overall, I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better buffets around despite the higher price point which might be a deterring factor. I think for the selection and quality that you're getting, it's worth a visit. Spacious and clean, nice décor and good ambiance. Highly recommended for family/large group gatherings on a special occasion.  Stand-out items were the sashimi, hand-pulled noodles and the Peking duck. Sashimi is really fresh although you're limited to a specific number of pieces per round (2 salmon and 2 tuna). A bit disappointing since it's supposed to be all-you-can-eat but I suppose you can just keep coming back. On that note, their sushi station (nigiri and maki rolls) is very decent as well.  I loved the hand-pulled noodles! (You can actually see someone pulling them into the pot). Broth was very flavourful with the duck but bbq pork is another option as well. It's given in a small bowl which is just the perfect portion.   Peking duck is also handed out to you by the staff so it can lead to line-ups but I never found it to be that bothersome .  The offering and level of quality of the 3 mentioned items alone justifies the price for me. Everything else (teppanyaki section with steak, shrimp chicken, wings, etc., general tao chicken and other cooked asian items, veggies, steam fish, fried oysters, dessert) is solid. I don't recall thinking anything was terrible or poor.   Both times that I've been here, staff was friendly and efficient. So no problems on that front.  To be fair, I've definitely been to buffets with more VARIETY such as Imperial but what Dragon Legend DOES serve, it serves it well."}
{"text":"Sunday dim sum - \"Better come early!\" I thought. Only upon arrival did I realize they have totally spiffed up this place. I was already impressed upon entry, but not nearly as much as when I got to see more of it, and up close, when even blind-as-a-bat moi could only come to a singular conclusion: THIS PLACE IS GORGEOUS!  There is enough wood here to satisfy all the peckers in the entire continent.  Everything is hefty, fine-grained, and simply but tastefully appointed.  To date, though, the hordes that haunted it for dim-sum on weekends have stayed away.  It was almost tranquil, sitting in a quiet corner, with half the tables unoccupied, and no more hub-bub of dim-sum carts (Ricky L - your wish come true!).    Everything we sampled was delicately and deliciously prepared.  As with many \"finer\" establishments, some Chinese restaurants are going the lighter route: low grease and low sodium.  But freshness overcomes what might be otherwise perceived as blandness. Not much that we sampled missed the mark - their specialty har gow coming as a trio instead of the usual quartet dampened things a nudge, since there were 4 of us. And the char siu bau (steamed BBQ pork bun) was just pretty standard.  Especially interesting is their take on the beef tseung fun, or the stuffed canneloni-like large rice noodle that's usually done with shrimp or char siu or beef, with a sweetened soya sauce poured over it. THEIR version of it is done with a chunk of steak (sirloin, which I believe was really the striploin or New York cut) in each of the 3 noodles!  At 8 bucks, it's not your usual tseung fun in more ways than one.  But when you figure there's a good 4 ounces of steak in it, perhaps it's not THAT pricey.  This is the one dish where I wish they would have gone a little bolder - steak calls for that; spice it up with traditional steak spices, or do a full-blown Chinese ginger/scallion version.  Small quibble.  You saw the tea cup picture.  Here's something that's clearly fancy beyond words, these double-walled perfectly-formed half globules.  We were sitting there wondering if these are hand-washed, or do they \"throw\" these in the dish washer, and in any case, how do you manage either.  These go along with the spoiled-brat clear glass teapots, set over a warming candle.  Their tea charge is $1.80, which I don't mind at all if it's good tea. They also offer \"extra special\" ones that are $2.80, or $4.00.  But I find the teapot hard to hold and awkward to pour.  No accidents today, but I'm feeling like taking out some insurance before I come next time.  They give you a pot of hot water in a thermos as a refill.  But instead of warming the brewed tea (which could change its flavor),  the right way (as I've always maintained) is the keep the BREWED tea in a thermos, and to refill the teapot with boiling water, which is the proper way of brewing tea.  Service was more deferential and attentive than usual Chinese restaurants.  Over in the other dining area, they have 2 HUGE TVs, and various large tables in intriguing formations.  I understand that at night they have a buffet, with what appears to be pretty impressive fare (traditional Chinese, including Peking duck, and sushi).  We might do that the next time we come up."}
{"text":"Dragon Legend quickly earned a reputation as the \"premium\" Chinese buffet restaurant in Markham. With Peking duck (my favourite), huge variety of stir fry, soups, dim sum, sashimi, sushi rolls and more, I was really excited to try this place and see how different it would be from the Canadian-Chinese food served at Mandarin. Sadly, unlike Mandarin, Dragon Legend's quality has declined pretty quickly.  My first visit here was in June 2014 with a large group. I was immediately impressed with how nice the interior is. The Peking duck was self-serve and the overall quality of food was pretty good. The sashimi was not too bad, but it doesn't compare to a restaurant that specializes in sushi, not that anyone would expect it to. The service was unmemorable but efficient, without any of the enthusiam found at Mandarin. I thought it was cool that they had bubble tea available to order (at additional cost). One thing that I thought was disappointing is the lack of hot crab legs. They're all on ice. +1 for Mandarin on weekends.   After every meal, the restaurant gives every guest a code to enter online to win a prize. From our table of approx. 14, two of us won a free lunch buffet. So a few months later, I returned to eat lunch on a weekday. There was no Peking duck and the other dishes were quite limited compared to dinner. Disappointing, but understandable considering how much cheaper lunch is than dinner. The service was, once again, unmemorable, but I won another free lunch so that was pretty sweet. To be honest, I was hoping to win the gold iPhone, but beggars can't be choosers.  I returned for another large dinner in October 2014. They moved the Peking duck to its own station with two women serving the duck, probably as portion control because Peking duck gets expensive. My family is fanatical about Peking duck so we just ended up getting three plates every time we went to the Peking duck station because they'd put so little duck on each wrap. I also don't like duck meat, just the skin, so it was pretty annoying to not be able to choose my own pieces.   The service was also lacking. Our waiter wasn't particularly friendly and it took a while to get our old plates removed. The bubble tea was also pretty bad. It was powdery and lacking flavour like a typical drink from Destiny. Maybe it was also bad the first time I tried Dragon Legend, but I don't really remember. But for the future, I now know to skip the bubble tea.   Dragon Legend's dinner buffet is a few dollars more than Mandarin, and in the past I would have said that it might be worth it. However, with Mandarin now serving Peking duck, the only thing that really seems to set Dragon Legend apart is the noodle soup station. Don't hesitate to check it out if you have a large group to feed, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"I have been to dragon legend buffet for a few times. The last time we went was in Chinese new year. The food quality was excellent. Everyone was very impressed."}
{"text":"I'm always curious why this all you can eat restaurant cost a third more then others. So I gave it a try at lunch time. For $14.99 the food was pretty good. The place is very nice inside. The service isn't much since it's a buffet. The only reason I didn't give a four star is because lot of there plate are chipped. I'm not a fan of eating with chipped plate and bowls. Otherwise it's pretty good restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Probably one of the WORST all you can eat sushi restaurant. The lines are horrific and the service is terrible. I heard so many good things prior to going to this place with my boyfriend but i was left with so many disappointments. The food selection was MEH. Resembles Mandarin to me, if you enjoy Mandarin then by all means this place is ok I guess... But for the price you are paying per person for dinner... This was such a rip off. The stuff did not taste fresh at all to me. Overall, bad experience. OH yeah, drinks are at EXTRA cost after paying 30 dollars + per person, soft drinks aren't even free.. LOL. Pathetic."}
{"text":"This place is LIVE! Get to pig out in a clubbing environment. Literally this establishment reminds me of tao nightclub in Vegas. Modern oriental feel to it. Lots of booths around the restaurant. Two seating rooms with one main food room.   Food: (based on long weekend service) lots of variety and quality was very good. All dishes were stocked efficiently and timely. Missing star is in the sushi department since I love sushi and the typical sushi rolls were mediocre at best. They so serve sweet shrimp, salmon and hamachi.   Highlights: ayce Peking duck, longevity soup, 3 colored hand cut noodles, unlimited crab legs  Service: really efficient on a busy long weekend. Dirty plates were always cleared and they provided warm wet napkins at the end  Decor: traditional oriental furnishing with a modern twist. The washroom is presented like the clubs downtown- the sinks are unisex and then split into private washroom. The lights are dimmed to give a more afterlife ambiance. In the room I was seated in there were two huge projectors that was playing the nba game  Overall, I definitely recommend this place (since my picky parents were very impressed)"}

{"text":"We came here with the entire family for an early Chinese New Year dinner on a Sunday night. This location is better than the one at Yorkmills and Don Mills, not sure why. This is a Asian buffet for Asians, clearly the food taste more authentic. They have many people working and the food is served in much smaller batches compared to the Mandarin, helping to ensure the food is hot and fresh. They have 2 giant TVs in the main dining room - probably making the Chinese clientele feel more at home since every Chinese person I know has a bad habit of watching TV while they eat. Anyhow back to the review. Service was top notch, non aggressive or pushy while efficient and subtle. Interior is very amusing and adds to the experience. Dinner buffet for adults was $29 few dollars more than other buffet but way worth it."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy! Good food, but too many people and not too much space to navigate through. Hopefully they'll expand one day. The selection is plentiful and is frequently refilled."}
{"text":"After hearing about all the positive comments by word of mouth, we decided to come here for Chinese New Years Dinner. I can't believe so many people came here before!  Let me start off with IT WAS PACKED. Like Jam-packed, I can barely walk with my plate of food because there were so many people everywhere. For a Chinese Buffet for a person who regularly eats Chinese food, this was one of the best buffet locations (usually Chinese buffets don't taste anything like Chinese food). Thankfully, making a reservation 2-3 weeks in advance, we were granted a seat 15 minutes before the actual time of reservation.   The decor of this place is beautiful - I'm actually quite impressed how much thought they put into the decor, allowing privacy per table, instead of cramming together more seats for people. The actual area for food is rather small, but the dishes are small, so there's quite a large variety of selection. There's sashimi, sushi, fresh and fried oysters, a robotic arm making noodles, teppanyaki with steak, filets, hand made pork jerky, dim sum, PEKING DUCK, typical Chinese dishes and Chinese desserts.   The fresh oyster was rather large (you can have 2 at a time), and the bottom portion wasn't sliced making it difficult to eat. The sashimi pieces were a little large, and you are not able to obtain many pieces of sashimi at a time - there is a limit that you can take to prevent you from wasting food.   One of the best items in my opinion is the peking duck, which you can take four at a time - there's usually a line up for this. Other items are replenished rather quickly, I admire the amount of times staff come out of the kitchen to ensure that the food is fresh."}
{"text":"So I was here last week with my family my sister and brother in law.. we got there around 4:45pm and it was empty I think there was only a few people at that time and it is our lucky we got before the rush came in cause after 5:30pm you can see the place got packed.. so I suggest if you want to go with the whole family plan ahead of time and make a reservation..  The appearance of the place is stunning looks so traditional with the design and the have half a boat in the dining area which o think it's very cute when kids want to take photos with it. And they have a beautiful photo of an Asian lady..  I'll be very honest their buffet menu/table is very small of you are going to compare it to other buffets like mandarin spoonful and imperial. And they are a bit more on the expensive side but for the price that you have to pay you get the higher end of the dishes that other places would rarely put out unless they do a month special.. and the special they had on top of the high end menu the had a coupon per adult for Lobster and Scalop which of course was a big his to my significant other.. the dish that I fell in love with and can say is worth every penny in paying the price for the buffet is the Peking duck.. you are a limit of 4 per visit to the buffet area so I can say everytime I went back for food I got 4 Peking duck every time.. and they have fried rice cake and sweet potato pancakes.. the dimsum they have shumai and hakaw was delicious.. I was not a big fan of the fresh noodle soup they had  the flavor was very bland the texture of the fresh noodles was good though.. dessert they had what ever other buffet has but the selection in flavor of ice cream is rare from black sesame to ginger it was really good..  Over all the experience was wonderful I don't think o would go as often as I would love top since the price is a bit heavy to pay esp with 3 kids..  I would definitely recommend my friends and family to go her to have a higher end of buffet"}
{"text":"Giving my honest review despite not caring much for buffets.    My family came here for the first time for my brother's birthday dinner. Right when you walk in, you can see the sea of people up and about plopping heaps of food onto plates. At first glance, there definitely was a lot of variety. They had a sushi bar, a few sections for cooked food, a seafood bar, a dessert bar, and a noodle bar. Also worth noting is the Peking duck that was served, which is a rarity among Chinese buffets. Being vegan limited me from eating the majority of the food, and I ended up eating sushi maki and steamed vegetables (which I have no problem eating, but definitely not worth it at a buffet). And of the food that I ate, none of it was stellar. Everything just tasted.. average. I just expected for them to have a little more flavour in their food and a few more vegan friendly options than what was presented.   Anyway, I was quite disappointed with my experience here, after having heard many great reviews. If you are vegan, I would pass coming here as you won't have much to choose from. You'd be better off spending your $35 (yep, dinner on a weekend is $30.99) on a non-buffet meal. However, my non-vegan family appreciated the wide selection they were granted. But the verdict was that the quality and taste was just average.   The take away is that if you eat meat, like variety and prioritize quantity, go for it; else, you can skip this one."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation for a party a few weeks ahead of time. This was a party of about 30. The day after I booked the reservation, I got a call back asking if we were going in that night. My heart skipped a beat, and not in a good way. Somehow, when I had booked my reservation, they had managed to give me all the information I had booked for (the actual date and time I wanted), but then had booked it on the wrong day! Thankfully, due to their reminder call, I was able to sort through that issue, and we reserved again for the right day.  The day of: 1) This place has very little parking. It's a bit of a nightmare. People have to park on the street, and in the parking lot of the hotel next door... 2) It didn't help that Tuesdays until September? their dinner price is $20.99, so there were lots of people. 3) We got a semi-private room. When I say that, I mean that in this room, there are 4 tables that seat 8 people, and then there's a table for 4 tucked away in an alcove in the room. The 4 tables of 8 were for my party. Then, Dragon Legend decided to seat a party of 4 in the corner of our room. Talk about awkward. I feel sorry for those people. We had speeches and whatnot, and they had to listen to it all. 4) Getting to seating is quite complicated. You have to walk through the buffet area in order to get to your seat, so you have to walk through the part of the restaurant with the highest amount of traffic. 5) Food was alright. Sashimi (salmon and butter fish last night) was fairly fresh. Peking duck was good (I really appreciate how for each wrapper, they gave you at least two pieces of duck) and it was fresh (due to the crazy line for this, it had to be fresh). I was told their handmade noodles were really really good. Their roast beef was decent. Their taro mousse was fake taro. Their mango pudding was delicious, but didn't have much mango taste. The highlight of their dessert table (for me) was their ginger milk pudding. I'm not big on ginger, so this suited me quite well. It wasn't a ginger punch in the face. It was gingery in a distinct, but not in-your-face way. These are so good that I had two dishes (individual portions) even though I'm watching my sugar intake. 6) Group price is $27/person. It includes tax and tip and Chinese tea and pop (coke and sprite), but only if you pay cash and arrange it with them ahead of time.  All in all, still one of the best buffets in Toronto right now, to my knowledge, but it could have been better. I'll probably still be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous! I live downtown and will go out of the way just to come here.  The buffet is so diverse and fairly good quality of food especially compared to other buffets (Mandarin what?). DragonLegend differs from many Asian buffets in terms of offering unique dishes such as Peking Duck, Oxtail, Dim Sum, Sushi etc.   The selection has Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian, Vietnamese options.  The dessert options are delicious - creme brulee, cheese cake, ginger pudding, ginger ice cream!   There a la carte is also delightful. There portions are fairly generous and they have special prices for seasonal dishes (around Chinese New Year). I always order  the Beef Congee Soup (my favourite).   I also really like the decor. Beautiful wood.   It is certainly pricier compared to other Asian buffets and restaurants however I believe you really get your moneys worth.  The food does not make me feel sick even after I eat a TON of it and I am always craving the food the next day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch on a Friday afternoon at Dragon Legend. The reason I mention the day and time is because this will affect the quality of the food greatly.  Perhaps if you attend Dragon Legend on a Saturday afternoon, you will find a wonderful variety of delicious items just waiting to be devoured.  The lunch menu on the weekday has little variety and a lot of items that are generally offered at dinner are not offered at lunch.  My advice, Dragon Legend should save some money on the decor and improve there lunch menu.   For you patrons, don't go on a weekday afternoon. Spend a little more money and go on a Saturday or Sunday."}
{"text":"Ambience is great, food is lackluster and cold, the cooks in the grill area barely bothers to restock their roast beef, and flat top items. Sushi tasted like they dumped 3 gallons of vinegar on the rice and the food just feels underwhelming and very basic. Come only if you absolutely know the food will be good that day."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Their sashimi is fresh AND thick. Dayummmm. Floors were a little sticky though and I'm not sure why.  _____ I came here with friends before, but my family and I came to celebrate my mom's and my lunar birthday.   The area is well-lit with pockets of shadow for ambience. I really liked the dining area and decor. The chairs looked really unique with super tall backs and red sticks coming out as accents. There was enough space in the venue to walk comfortably in both the dining area and buffet area.   The selection of food seems more limited than when I previously came. There was dim sum (siu mai, har gow, fried pastries, spring rolls...), shrimps, mussels, General Tso's chicken, fried noodles, fried rice, vegetables (like gai lan), steamed fish, grilled sole, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, bbq red sausage, salad bar, dessert bar, etc. There was also a sushi bar, and they limit the amount of sashimi you can take at a time (3 salmon, 2 butter fish).   They also have a Peking Duck station. You can take 4 at a time. They give you the wrap and the meat, and you put on the condiments and sauce yourself. This part was unique compared to other Asian buffets because not many would have such a high maintenance food like Peking Duck.   I SUPER loved their mushroom and chicken broiled soup. I have no idea how it directly translates into Chinese, so I know it doesn't sound appetizing right now but it does taste really good. Both the old and young are huge fans of this soup. It's also very healthy, especially with those goji berries in there. :)   Why it's a 3 is because the food quality was .. just a-ok. The mashed potatoes were still watery and the only thing that stood out to me was the sashimi, which was fresher than I expected. Their tiramisu was alright too, and I was quite satisfied with it.   In terms of entrée food, I liked the grilled sole and that beautiful soup I mentioned earlier (which is located at the same station). Otherwise, nothing else much stood out aside from these dishes.   The price was a little steep, but I think their quality was much better back in the old days. I wouldn't come here again, as I don't believe the price justifies the quality of the food. But if you do happen to stumble into this place, you have to try their soup!"}
{"text":"We went here for a celebration and it was packed. It's a very large buffet; larger than Mandarin with a lot of interesting decor.  The food was however too salty for me.  It's a good place to try at least once but I'm unsure if I would return.  Food: 3/5, a lot of selection which is nice to have and I got to try a lot of different types of food from traditional americanized chinese food to custom noodles and sushi.  The special lobster you get for dinner was good too.  The food while it tasted good was also very salty which wasn't great.  If you want to try a bit of everything, this place is good for that.  Service: 3/5, not the best for a buffet, they didn't clear the dishes fast enough nor were drinks refilled. They can learn a bit from Mandarin on this one.  Ambiance: 1/5, very odd, a lot of weird videos playing but cool decor but their seating is TERRIBLE, the chairs are very large and literally touching each other side to side and too close to other tables so it's very difficult to GET OUT to get your food which is the whole point of buffets.  They need to fix this one.  Price: 2/5, it's ok at around $30+ per person but I think buffets these days are not as great as they used to be for the price they charge."}
{"text":"Holy.... this place has SO many reviews... has everyone in the GTA been here?! Damn! The decor of this place is intense, if not overdone. It lights up at night, and the first time I drove by after dark, I thought there was an LED show or a concert. The inside is huge and the seating area is the biggest I've ever seen for a buffet. My dad's friend is also the architect who designed and arranged it, and damn, he did a good job. Traditional chinese furniture with a twist- like asian game of thrones, as somebody said.   The buffet offers a medium amount of asian food. Not too much but not too little. The food is piping hot and fresh. I wish they had more veggies, other than oily green beans and cantonese 'choy'. It's hard being a vegan/vegetarian and eating here.. there's a lot of meat, sushi and pan fried/fried foods. If I was a kid again, it would be my dream. However, as an adult, the food is mediocre and simply not worth over $30/person per dinner. The one thing I always enjoy are the chocolate dipped strawberries- sooooo delicious, oh my. It's also interesting how they have fresh peking duck here. The service was also extremely quick, and they changed our plates & refilled our water promptly.   I enjoyed it here, but the price will deter me from coming back unless it's another birthday or another event."}
{"text":"Finally came to try this place! Heard a lot of great things about this restaurant before coming here.This restaurant has a decent variety of buffet items to choose from. In total, I paid $42 including taxes and tips plus unlimited drinks because of a private function. I love the all you can eat Peking duck!! Although its not like the one you get at Chinese restaurants, I still loved and enjoyed it. There were oysters that you could get 2 at a time and enjoyed eating that too. The staff for the most part are friendly and the service is decent. The decor and ambience in the restaurant is better than other buffets. I would definitely come back. This buffet has better value and better food quality than other similar buffets."}
{"text":"I don't really enjoy buffets but can say dragon legend legend is great and is definitely worth a visit. I came here for lunch numerous times, and have always walked away happy (and full!).   As others have noted, the Peking duck, sashimi, and hand pulled noodles were all fantastic. There was rarely an issue with things running out. I was actually surprised how good those noodles were, they were chewy and delicious. Try for the fish broth, which is much better than the spicy beef broth, and add everything - dumplings, BBQ pork, and some beef slices with coriander and green onion! I'm not afraid to admit the sushi was actually pretty good and was really impressed because general Buffet places serve typically poor sushi.  There is great selection of items and there is something for everyone. The dim sum was passable and the grill items were grilled well. The quality stands out here, I didn't eat anything that tasted bad. Great variety of fruits and ice cream cap off a fantastic meal.   We did come here with a large group and the service was great. Plates were taken away and our tea was refilled often.   I just have to comment about those high chairs, they are so bizarre, do not hang your coats on them!"}
{"text":"This is a Chinese buffet restaurant. It's very nicely decorated, you will feel like you've entered an ancient imperial palace (sort of) as soon as you step inside. The food are quite authentic, definitely better quality than Mandarin (no sweet & sour pork, or chicken balls). They have a grill station where they make grilled shrimp, beef ribs, squid, etc. They also have a noodles station that makes fresh bowls of noodles. My favourite item there is the peking duck wrap, pair it with some sauce and cucumber & green onion, it's even more delicious than some authentic Beijing restaurants! The wonton soup there is also delicious, as well as the chicken ginseng soup. They also have a sashimi and sushi area, and I'm a big fan of fresh raw fish, so I enjoyed it. Overall, the food quality was very good. It's slightly pricier than other buffet places, but I think it's worth paying a bit extra for good food."}
{"text":"Within the GTA this is one of the premier Chinese buffets around. The restaurant is spacious and the selection of items is quite good. I will have to say any of the food you eat at a buffet will be lower quality than that of a specialized restaurant. However if comparing apples to apples the quality of the food is still very good and day and night compared to lower tier buffets (ie. not this place or Mandarin). Our meal was on Wed night.  I'll start from front to back in my review of the types of food available. First up is the noodle bar, they have this cool machine that slices pieces of dough directly into a massive wok of hot water. They have a few different types and it's nothing really special, but the fresh noodles are nice.  Next up, the sale bar, not a huge fan of these in general but the selection is not bad and has enough options for everyone.  The selection of sushi and rolls are pretty standard for a buffet. They have a server for the sashimi (butter fish, tuna and salmon) which is ok. Rolls are mediocre at best.  The Chinese food is good. A huge improvement over any lower tier buffet. Good options, all meat and seafood groups are represented, along with dim sum (har gow and sui mai) and soups. The Peking duck station gives you two pieces but it's just OK.  The grill area has standard options again, chicken, fried dumplings, squid, sausage, etc. The meat station had prime rib which was good, cooked medium. There were also oysters (one per adult).  The dessert bar had a good selection of cookies, cakes and tarts. Creme brûlée was ok and I managed to get a fresh waffle off the iron which was nice. Ice cream is on the opposite side and pretty standard selection of flavours here. I go with my favourite: green tea.  Service wasn't the best. I only saw our server twice, start and end of the meal. Plates would be picked up while I was gone but they were never around when I was seated. Water got refilled once without asking.  Buffets in general are far from the highest levels of quality but make up for it with sheer quantity and selection. Dragon Legend is definitely worth a visit. I would highly recommend this place over it's sister restaurant Dragon Pearl, which imo is a lot worse for the same price."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after reading and hearing so many positive comments.   We went for dinner on a early weeknight. Decor is nice and the general layout of the buffet stations efficient.   Considering the price is higher than average I was expecting more selection. They had a poor facsimile of Peking Duck and some sashimi sushi. No other seafood like crab or lobster.  Dim Sum selection was limited to 3-4 items. Desserts were small western cakes, etc. No 'Chinese' favourites. Overall I was disappointed in the small selection of choices at all the food stations. This IS after all a 'buffet'. On the positive side the food was generally well prepared and seasoned with the exception of the so-called  'perking duck'.  Soups were also very good.   Service good, establishment clean.   Overall 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Food selection was decent. Food quality was below average. Most dishes were just passable, nothing was very tasty. Service was below average. Took a while to clean up our plates and only came once for water refill. Best thing about this place was the cute tea setup ($2.30 charge per person)   Decor is very nice.  At the $11.99 lunch Tuesday special, it's OK. Definitely not worth the regular lunch price of $15.99."}
{"text":"When you first enter the door, it seems like you've entered a whole new world. The interior design is crazy. There are historical sculptures all throughout, and everything looks really amazing. It has a really ancient Chinese theme to it.   The dining room is quite large, and the seats are really comfortable too. The servers there are on point with refilling drinks and collecting empty plates.   The food selection is decent, it has it's basis covered in terms of buffet food. Nothing really poses a 'Wow factor' all the dishes are just mediocre. Their sushi/sashimi selection is pretty horrible. The fish doesn't look too presentable, and the rolls look horrible.   I enjoyed my overall experience dining at Dragon Legend. The food could be better, but what can you really expect for steam table food, that sits there for hours. Would I go back? Yes, I definitely would."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday. The selection is not that bad. The service was very attentive. Great ambience feel. I enjoy the chicken soup. They also have a boat table for special occasions."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet. Usually buffets offer a lower quality but this place has good quality food. They have everything plus peking duck. They also have a fresh noodle bar.   On weekends, they have crab legs. The last time I went, they had a seafood boil with crawfish. They don't have crawfish every time though. They have a large selection of food so everyone is happy. There was a good variety of desserts at the their station, including creme brulee.  Service was good too. They clean up your table pretty efficiently."}
{"text":"Lots of variety here, was not expecting bbq pork and curry fish balls. The food they have is way better than mandarin's and they even have Peking duck wraps. The food was always refilled and fresh and the staff were very attentive. I would definitely return here"}
{"text":"Heard about this new chinese buffet opened in Markham and always super busy.  So I decided to come here with my family on a weekend for dinner.  First thing when i walked in was how impressive the decoration was.  Hardcore very traditional Chinese style with tons of red colour everywhere!!   and that was pretty much the only thing I was impressed with about this place.  The buffet selection is very typical besides the All you can eat perking duck (which by the way was super oily and they skin tons of meat with it which is the incorrect way of doing it) and all you can eat scallop sashimi.  The two food items I kept getting were the scallop sashimi and the \"hand shave\" noodles.    For the price you pay for this buffet place for dinner on a weekend, you can have MUCH better food elsewhere.  Will I come back again?  Properly never."}
{"text":"Even on Monday, Dragon Legend has scores from all over fill it's grandiose spaces with h hungry patrons. The thing with buffets is you try to retain valuable real estate for things like duck breastwoth fresh wraps, steak grilled to order, and if I had some room left, fresh Pho with all the trimmings.   What a vast selection of food, from fresh garlic green beans and eggplant, to fan favs like crispy sweet and sour chicken, fried shrimp and a landscape of sashimi and sushi rolls. If you like oysters, grilled fish and salad, it's all there too. Of course, the challenge is keeping the valuable real estate to make up for the $30 per person charged. Often, with the amount of sodium, MSG and fats involved, at most you could only go up twice with a few deserts after.   Speaking of deserts, you have to try the Macha items, like the Macha mouse cake and fruit. Josh got to enjoy some ice cream and trust me, there were a fair amount of deserts to rival the vast selection of food.  In terms of the venue, it is spectacular. Greeted with a giant drum and a huge bar, the entrance takes you to a Far East paradise. Don't be surprised with the common sinks shared between the men and ladies restrooms.   So, if you are in the mood for some awesome buffet, make sure you come extremely hungry to get your monies worth. Enjoy -Zuk"}
{"text":"If I had to choose a Chinese buffet to go to, it would be here. I love the decor and the variety of selections. The food is tasty and fresh and they always refill quickly. Some of my favourites were the whole plate of salmon sashimi prepared in front of you, peking duck and the dimsum. The selection of the desserts is also amazing! Can't wait for my next visit..."}
{"text":"Step aside Mandarin, this is an out of control buffet! What used to be the old La Rosa Banquet Hall has jettisoned the Italian motif and went Asian.  This place is huge--how huge you ask?  There are TWO 12' video projection screens on opposing walls showing cartoons for the kids.  and that is in one end of the building.  the interior design is really interesting, not just simple decorations, this place was maxed out for effect.  Go big or go home.  But the food:  real Asian treats, especially the Chinese dishes and Dim Sum.  A variety of kiosks feature different themes.  Sushi in one area, Dim Sum in another, freshly grilled shrimp and beef on another.  Congee and noodles, dumplings, oriental ice cream...This is not Mandarin, where the buffet includes pizza and a salad bar.  Dragon Legend is all Asian, all the time.  Food quality is high.  I noted that many dishes I sampled were just as good as non buffet establishments serve, sometimes better.  And I got to keep going back for more.  And more.  And more... And I think I hurt myself.  More...  Can't stop..."}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent decor. But heck it's busy as...well...you know. Smart thing to do...MAKE A RESERVATION!!! We did for Mother's Day. Parking was not plentiful and when we walked in, it was extremely crowded! Luckily with a reservation, you bypass the crowds and get taken in like a VIP!"}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5/3  Went here for my Canada Day lunch (Happy Canada Day to everyone :D) and it was an alright experience. I think at this point in my Yelp journey, I have just kinda lost all my motivation and excitement over highly raved places like Dragon Legend. Why? Well, they usually don't give me that big wow factor. Anyways, I made a reservation on Thursday because you know this place is usually packed and apparently reservations have to be made a month in advance? LOL for me that was not the case for both. It wasn't packed at all (I did have my lunch at 1:45 pm so idk if that made a different or not; kinda highly doubt it). It was kinda funny cause I overheard some of the kitchen ppl be like \"Oh snap man, this is not how I expected today to be. It's usually packed..blah blah blah.\" Ha. ITS A GREAT TURNOUT FOR ME BECAUSE I DON\"T HAVE TO FIGHT TO THE GODS TO FIND A PARKING PLACE OR TO GET FOOD YU KNOW WUT IM SAYING?!?   The decor was fairly nice. I really liked how dark (dark but bright enough to see shit) it was. FOR ME, I hate overly bright places because I just feel like I am being put into the spotlight. They have like two giant screen things (wtf were they called? LOL) and it's nice. Food wise, it was mediocre. To be honest, I didn't really like most of the stuff they had. Some were too salty, some lacked the saltiness and taste, some were overcooked, and some were just like huh? Out of everything, I probably liked the grilled pineapple, the sweet potato pastry, the fries, the egg drop and corn soup, and the steamed soup the most. I kinda wished they had a even bigger variety of things to eat (this is just me). I want something exciting boys and girls. I want to be wowed. BRUH. WOW ME. Oh, don't know if every buffet is like this but you have to pay for drinks? I mean I understand for more sophisticated drinks like cocktails and what not but for soda, I wished it was free. I mean the price for the buffet for lunch time is pretty expensive so you know it would be cool if they can throw in a coke or wuteva. BUT THATS JUST ME. YET AGAIN. I AM PICKY AND DEMANDING BUT YES.  Would I come again? Maybe. To be honest, Dragon Legend is the only decent buffet around these days. I can't seem to find any good ones anymore. Even though I did say I wanted this place to have a bigger variety of food, it aint bad. Pretty passable."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place last night as a result of a bit of research on buffets around the area. It turns out they offered $25 per adult on Tuesday nights which we thought was a good enough deal for the value. It was suggested and luckily no one veto'd the choice. It was actually my second time coming to this place but not much changed from when I initially went (which was a couple months ago).  First off, if you're going on a busy night, don't expect any parking spots. The parking lot is tiny and fills up quickly on busy nights. Do not be surprised to be relegated to parking on the streets (and you'll probably find most other restaurant patrons give up and follow suit, rather than wait for a spot to open up). I'm not sure if it is due to the layout or just due inadequate parking but just giving fair warning.  As you've probably read from other reviews, this is a Chinese themed buffet, and upon entering the restaurant, you'll be surrounded by Chinese figurines and wall pieces that are worth a second or two of admiration, but as you look around, you'll notice that they try to create the impression of a more upscale ambiance in comparison to your standard Chinese buffet. Due to the price premium, I guess you could say that attention to the improved décor and environment is warranted, but can be lost on the people who only care about the real reason for going to the restaurant in the first place, which is the food!  Speaking of the food, let's get down to the brass tacks of this review.  I'd have the say the overall selection of the food was decent but with a caveat. It definitely had more unique offerings compared to the standard buffet, like Chinese shrimp dumplings (Har Gow), Peking Duck and even Sashimi/Butter fish, freshly cut noodles for their noodle soup, and Chinese ginseng soup. However because of this, the actual main staples of the buffet were kind of lacking. They didn't have much in terms of what you would normally find in a buffet.   And to their defense I can't blame them; the novelty of some of the more niche items would persuade you to choose those foods over more of the standard foods. But what I guess I felt was missing was that the novelty does wear off eventually and you kind of get tired of having the same niche things over and over again. It kind of sounds contradictory and counter-intuitive but my friends and I basically had the same opinion after the first few plates - that there was a variety, but not much selection if that makes sense.   The actual food quality was what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. However I believe they used too much MSG in a lot of the plates as I found myself extremely thirsty after each plate. It was good for a buffet, but don't expect any miracles in terms of quality.   I'll briefly go over each of the \"stations\" that were available from what I remember:  Salad/Fruit station: I usually skip this part as it is relatively low value, but my friends got a couple fruits and it was just okay from their perspective The sushi station: They offered a few new \"rolls\" that I've never seen before but most of the sushi rolls looked pretty standard. Nothing special or noteworthy   The hot soup/noodle station: They had a machine cutting the noodles and it was dressed up as a chef doing it which I thought was kind of funny. I didn't try it because the line was too long, however my friend tried it and said it was just okay.   The Peking Duck station: You were limited to 4 pieces, and I thought it was good. Can get busy during the dinner rush, but worth it. You can also ask for it without the wrapping skin if you don't want to fill up on that haha  Grilled food station: The roast beef was quite good, they had a rare/medium-rare side and a well done side so you could choose which one you wanted which I thought was considerate. Also they make all the little deep friend pancakes/dumplings/grilled vegetables in front of you which is kind of cool. The grilled lemongrass chicken was quite good. The dumplings were chicken and not so good unfortunately.   Ice cream/dessert - They had unique flavours, green tea, cappuccino and black sesame along with the standard vanilla, chocolate. They didn't have much in the option of sprinkles/marshmallows, but they did have a cone which I ended up getting. No soft serve ice cream machine. Their cakes/pastries were not that visually appealing, and I don't usually end up eating those so I cannot comment on their taste  Overall I'd give it 3 stars. The quality of the food was acceptable (albeit a bit over seasoned), but as mentioned earlier I felt that there was a variety of foods but you'd find yourself only eating the same foods over and over again. At regular price, I don't think I would recommend it, but at $25 I'd say it's worth a shot. Just be prepared for a long wait and busy parking lot."}
{"text":"I love the variety at dragon legend! Their hand pulled noodles and Peking duck are delicious. The broth of the noodles are great too, and definitely exceed my expectations for buffet place. The sushi is alright... save room for the other dishes."}
{"text":"I tried to take advantage of the Tuesday night dinner buffet deal, but I ended up leaving after trying to make my way through the congested parking lot. I eventually came back for lunch on a Friday, and the crowd was much better. The place itself looks very nice on the inside.. definitely one of the coolest looking buffets I've been to. Atmosphere was excellent and everything was very clean.  The sushi selection was very disappointing. I usually like to start off buffet meals with a plate of sushi, but I couldn't get close to a full plate here. I only found 3-4 rolls that interested me here. I have a feeling that the sushi selection at dinner is much better. The quality of the sushi seemed to be about average as far as buffets go. The cooked foods were a little disappointing as well. Most of the options were generic Chinese dishes that I tend to avoid at buffets. The grilled section was pretty good. The best thing available here was the grilled salmon. The skin was crunchy and the fish was cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the grilled udon.   The noodle station was probably the highlight of the meal for me. The handpulled noodles were delicious, and the spicy soup was very tasty. There was almost always a line because they make everything to order, but it was worth waiting for. The dessert section was also really good. Everything I tried in this section was great, and I found myself wishing I had more space in my stomach to try other desserts. My favorite item in this section was probably the waffles. They had a person making waffles (4 small waffles at a time), and I thought that was a nice touch. I remember grabbing one of the freshly made waffles and inadvertently squishing it with the tongs because it was so soft. I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the waffle with some sprinkles, and it was amazing.  Overall, my lunch here was decent, but it definitely could've been much better. The prices seemed about right to me, and the service was on point. I'm not sure if I would come back for the lunch buffet, but I would definitely be willing to give this place a shot for dinner (assuming the parking lot isn't as crazy). The Friday night oyster special sounds pretty cool, and I hope to try it one day."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet and one of the best restaurants i have ever been. I always grade how attentive the staff is, they didnt even let me ask for refill my water. They walk around so much, make sure every table is taking care of. I can just come over here sushi and the soups alone, they are fresh and delicious. From the the salad section to dessert everything was very good. The selection of the dishes, and they are constantly busy. Make sure to have your reservation before you go and be on time. You may not have any table. The photos speak for themselves."}
{"text":"I accidentally made a reservation with Dragon Pearl and sent half my party there when I meant to go to Dragon Legend... Thankfully, the two restaurants are under the same owner and Dragon Pearl was understanding with my mistake and everyone ended up at the right restaurant.   I made a last minute reservation and they said we wouldn't be seated until 7:30pm. I got there at 7:10pm and they were kind enough to seat us promptly.   Food wise... it is a typical Asian AYCE food choice. I love sashimi and was somewhat puzzled by how people can take as many white tuna sashimi as they would like but they limit the salmon, shrimp, and hamachi sashimi... I practically went back to back 4 times with different plates to get enough for my fix. It would have been better if I could have just gotten the amount that I wanted in the first round. Nonetheless, I love their torched sushi, something different from the usual sushi choices!  I also love that they serve dragon fruit, very sweet and ripe. Highly recommend this place! ^^"}
{"text":"You'd think 4:30pm is too early for AYCE. I'm thankful we ate early because the front was packed with people by 6:15pm with reservations.  Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review of Dragon Legend compared to what I wrote since it's opened. I know how difficult it is, when business just can't keep up with their grand opening quality...you get an updated review (Thanks Yelp for allowing so!)  Parking has somewhat improved since it's no longer new and people forget about places so easily..  Anyways, alot of food choices, from fresh sashimi to cooked, fresh scallops ..quality is fresh and they have a person standing there to serve so ppl don't go crazy over one item..   Hot fooods: steak is gone! BOOO...last 2 times, I was here, no such option...  Peking duck, dim sum, veggies and oh yeah...the *knife cut * noodle they make with soup...thats quite different...to a regular buffet..   I came with a huge crew so we were seated towards the back of the restaurant...we had like 19 peepz...so it was quite difficult to chat due to the amount of people we had...=P  Service was an A-OK...and the prices went up...Monday - Thursday @ $24.99 and Friday - Sunday @ $30.99 is a little pricey too..price going up so quickly when its opening is less than a year...hmm..quality down and prices up.. I never understand that formula..=P"}
{"text":"I would say Dragon Legend/ Dragon Pearl are the best Chinese buffet in GTA. We enjoy the varieties. This is the only buffet that has peking duck and sashimi for lunch......Amazing!!!! not a lot of buffets offer sashimi for lunch.   And!!!! I really enjoy their noodle soups especially they make the noodles fresh and I love the spicy beef broth.  Dessert wise~~~sweet tofu (???)- one of my fav!!  Our overall experience is pretty awesome! I definitely recommend this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"large variety of selections, but $16 is a bit pricey for lunch. Peking duck is only available for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food, you can tell it's quality food! My family as well as my best friends family (table of 12) came here for New Year's Eve. It was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised with the massive selection and quality of food items. However, I did feel rushed, and the customer service is just not there. I'll still be back, but when there is obviously less rush."}
{"text":"I would say this is the best AYCE buffet in town.  You can expect to find high quality Chinese food that you usually can't get at regular AYCE restaurant.  Peking duck, slow cooked soup, grilled calamari are some of my favourite."}
{"text":"Before I start, I have to say, that if I was comparing this restaurant to a buffet only category, this would definitely be a 4 star.  However, rating this as a place to go with comparisons to all places elsewhere, I would have to say it's relatively average.  The variety is great, if not one of the best out of all buffet places I have ever been aside from that one time I went in Vegas. There is a lot cuisines in a buffet that is mostly Chinese in nature, but they have the western styles down pat as well.  My previous workplace loved them because it was a relatively cheap venue and the food is on a holistic level good.    Definitely worth spending some time if you want a buffet experience and want something more than just a normal \"Mandarin\" or typical \"sushi buffet\" experience."}
{"text":"This is a solid buffet! They don't put out huge quantities so it seems to stay fresh. I would recommend you try it once! The setting is clean/grand."}
{"text":"After trying out their dinner buffet when they first opened, we were quite surprised with the quality of food, sweet shrimp sashimi, Peking duck, etc, but haven't been back since. We finally made it back for lunch after hearing about the $11.99 special on Tuesdays.   The parking and lineup inside was a nightmare. The food was below average and was loaded with so much MSG, we all drank at least 6-8 cups of water in less than an hour. The selection wasn't great either, just your typical mandarin items like Chicken Wings, BBQ Pork, Dumplings. The only items I enjoyed were the Hand Cut Noodles, and the Tofu Desert. The staff were attentive, and always collected our plates.   It's worth the visit, especially for $11.99, but definitely not for regular price. Dinner quality is better, but again not really worth $32.99."}
{"text":"Ok, let me start by saying I'm not a fan of buffet type places.  So why go ?  I was there with some work colleagues.   As far as buffets go, this one is huge !  Arrived and we were seated in a huge open room with many tables.  As they lead you to the tables you walk through the buffet area.  Of course it let you see what there is.    The servers were very pleasant and attentive.  There seemed to be many of them circulating and I couldn't ever tell who was our actual server as it appeared we had a new person every time.  No matter all were good.    Went to the buffet and there is a huge selection.  Some Sushi, some Chinese dishes, and even some North American dishes.  There is even a Peking Duck station.  Which as definitely good.  Having been to Beijing, it's not quite Beijing quality, but probably one of the better ones in Canada.  All the food is good, but then for buffet its more about quantity than quality.     Once done, paid for our meal and out we went.    Overall, Service was very good/friendly, and food was good for buffet.  Parking was pretty easy, but then again we were there @ 7.30p on a week night.  Don't get me wrong this is a decent place, and good for buffet.  If my colleagues want to return I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"I came here for yum cha (lunch) and the buffet dinner.  The first time I went there, I was like \"wooh, I'm in China!\" The decors are really like the ones they have in Lijiang! It's like what you would see in those ancient times Chinese movies haha.  The decors and displays are very pretty. I like the teapots and tiny teacups despite the fact that I had to re-pour my tea multiple times because of how small the teacups were lol!   Lunch - ordered the usual dim sums - beef short ribs, chicken buns, shrimp dumplings (the display was so colourful & also very yummy) etc. I'll probably come here again for yum cha with my family.  Dinner buffet - they had a wide selection of sushi and sashimi. My friends and I scurried over to the sushi bar then the grilled foods, hot foods and desserts. Be prepared to eat A LOT, there're so much food. What stood out the most to me was the Kalguksu \"knife cut noodles\" - I'd recommend that with fish broth + cha siu (roasted pork). My friend got 5 bowls of that haha :D"}
{"text":"Went for buffet on a Friday night.  Got there just before 6pm and was able to get a parking spot in front of the restaurant.  The parking lot was packed when we left.    We were warmly welcomed when we stepped into the restaurant.  It's surprising HUGE.  It didn't look that big from the outside.  Decor was beautiful.  Staff was super attentive.  Even came down to taking away my semi-dirty napkin and giving me a new one.  Dirty plates were taking away immediately once you put them to the side.  Water was constantly refilled in a timely manner.  Food tastes alright...similar to what you can get at other buffets.  Had the peking duck, but the wrap was thick and dry.  They had a pretty good sushi / sashimi selection -but I found the rice a bit too soggy and dense.  Roast beef was near perfection at medium rare.  They had some items that aren't available at other Chinese buffets like deep friend plaintain banana, beef ribs.  I actually enjoyed the desserts, lots of traditional Chinese desserts not found in other buffet restaurants like brown sugar cake, sugar egg puffs, maltose syrup over some kind of deep fried dough twist - yum!  Price was pretty steep at $29.99 per adult, luckily we had a 15% off coupon.  I probably wouldn't go back without a coupon.  The experience was worth it."}
{"text":"For a AYCE Asian Cuisine place. Dragon Legend is the place to be. Their food selection is more unique. Like Peking Duck, Ginseng Soup, Sweet Shrimp Sashimi, etc.   Pretty busy place though, so best to book ahead of time. Especially on weekends n holidays."}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews on here, seemed to be pretty decent and I like Dragon Pearl...  This place is more expensive $29.99 on a Sunday and to compare the two places, you pay more here but you get less IMO.  Each one has it's own thing but you can base your judgement on this.  Dragon Pearl - half a lobster, fried dragon pearl and pulled noodles (it's one long strand that they cut, think udon noodles), dim sum, usual suspects and sushi.  Dragon Legend - They have nicer decor, sticky rice in lotus leaf, brown sugar cake (steamed), more authentic chinese food, more extensive sushi.  The taste is lacking though.  The peking duck at DL seems more fresh, that or because you have to line up to get it.  Sushi was just ok, nothing spectacular.  You had to line up to get salmon, butterfish, scallops.  I'm not a fan of raw scallops, didn't want to try it.    The big minuses - there are communal sinks outside the washroom area, one sink and the rest are outside.  Not a fan of this concept.  Also, there are only a few washrooms, DP is bigger.  The layout for DL is crowded, when you are waiting in line you have to bustle with other people just entering or leaving their dining area.    There is a big giant drum you can beat on, but I saw some sticky spots.  Dessert seems to be more abundant at DP.  They may try to convince you that you pay more here because you are getting a better variety of food (ie, shark's fin soup, but let me tell you.  The soup was devoid of any shark whatsoever.  It was mostly egg soup).    One of the big tv's was not playing until an hour before closing.  It was some cooking demonstration, which IMO is better than the war-like flick that plays over at DP.  One more thing, they sell a VIP card for $80, it is valid for two years and gets a birthday person and a guest to eat for free each year.  Other times you get 10% off  for up to 12 people.  Would I come here again?  Nope, which is too bad because the overall decor here is better than the funky blue statues at DP."}
{"text":"Review is strictly compared to other buffets that have similar  types of food.  I definitely like Dragon Legend more compared to their sister location, Dragon Pearl and other buffets like Mandarin, wasabi etc.  They have an excellent selection of food for a great value of $29.99 for weekend dinner. They had a whole sushi bar with scallop sashimi, salmon sashimi, white tuna, beef sashimi, and a bunch of cool assorted rolls. They have all you can GET peking duck. The skin is crispy and the sauce is very sweet and delicious. They had these gigantic fried oysters, which had too much batter on it. If you take some of the batter off, it was good!  They have deep fried frog legs, which give a spicy kick. They  had unlimited  crab legs, but it was pretty salty. I enjoyed the grilled area - they had grilled pineapple, which was good. Like Dragon Pearl, they had a noodle bar where they make noodles from scratch. The fish broth mixed with the spicy broth was good. My only criticism is that they only gave one piece of bbq meat, which is kinda stingey . They should give 3-4 pieces.  Overall, I really enjoyed this buffet for food selection, quality, and value.  I only wished they comp birthdays like they do at Dragon Pearl!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I come here mainly for the pekking duck. Everything else is your slightly better than average chinese buffet. I mean, anything blows mandarin out of the water."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located one light south of woodbine and highway 7, in Markham.  The outside of the restaurant seems alright, I thought the revolving doors was a nice thought to the design.  From first glance... The restaurant seems alright. Nice décor, seems pretty busy. Although I assumed the hostesses were unorganized because I had a reservation and they took more than 10 minutes to find the persons reservation ahead of me.  As I was seated, they were pretty friendly. Onto the food...  The salmon sashimi is very fresh! Although it's also very limited. They literally hire someone to hand out the sashimi because they don't want you to take too much. So much for all you can eat... I was kind of disappointed with that but it makes sense from a business perspective.  Service was beyond terrible - I watched as my glass was empty for about 40 minutes. Of course, during this time, I tried to wave down a server but they just looked at my glass and then kept on about their business. Finally, after a server came - she cleaned off the table and said she'd be back to refill my drink. That took another 10 minutes!  The plates are dirty and silverware wasn't cleaned properly.   In addition to all this, there really is a lack of food in this \"buffet.\" I really prefer a AYCE sushi place over this. The roast beef was dry and mostly fat, none of the food tasted decent besides the sashimi and yellowtail. This is pretty much a tiny step up from mandarin.  I didn't think this was worth the money but the fresh fish gave it that extra star.  2/5. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Dinner Buffet on Sunday night   I'm not a fan of buffets, especially at a steep price of $29.99, but I came here merely for the experience of eating with friends and checking out the elaborate ancient Chinese decor. That said, I lowered my expectations for the food to buffet standards.    The decor is pretty nice to look at. It actually reminds me of a restaurant I went to in China with the deep red walls, dark wood and vases/decorations. I also like the double walled glass tea cups for the dim sum service but didn't try as you have to pay for tea and drinks.   Food Recommendations:   Sushi bar - I would say this was the best section of food. Good selection of special rolls and sashimi. They limit 2 per turn of salmon, scallop and hamachi sashimi , all of which are pretty thick and fresh. (Sweet egg is way too sweet.)    Cold seafood bar - Cold mussels, shrimp, crab legs - not meaty though   Peking duck - the wrap is pretty thin and the duck pieces are thick.   Grilled pineapple  Black sesame icecream   Other food that could be improved:  Sweet and Sour soup - I thought this was ok but could be more sour and more spicy.   Beef Green Onion Roll - too tough to chew   Cooked to order steak cubes - good texture, but overly salty, and some pieces were under cooked.   Noodle Bar - this is a good selling point - fresh knife-cut noodles with choice of three soups (chicken broth, fish soup, spicy beef). A bit underwhelming.   Creme Brulee (individual) - not creamy enough, but i like the sugar on top.   Ginger Milk Pudding - no ginger taste, just milk pudding  Skip the taro dessert!!    Overall, a wide variety of food (sushi bar, grilled foods, Chinese stir fry, dim sum, noodle bar, desserts), but hit or miss on the taste."}
{"text":"Good variety of food. I enjoyed trying it out tonight. This location is way better than Scarborough."}
{"text":"Dragon Legend is definitely the best AYCE restaurant I've been to. I usually go to sushi buffets, so this was a nice fusion of different Asian foods.   We had a party of 10, and they sat us at a huge oval table with two lazy susans, which I think was a bit unnecessary. However, service was great throughout the night. I was thrilled to find fresh salmon sashimi and peking duck, two of my favourite foods. I would also recommend their torched rolls and crab legs. The cappuccino ice cream was also fantastic.  The décor (both inside and out) of this place is impressive. There are many grandiose elements that really elevate the environment. Though pricier than other AYCE meals, I definitely think a visit here is worthwhile."}
{"text":"This is a chinese buffet, but it has many asian flavors.  The night we went there was an oyster special (2 per person, per take).  The peking duck was a highlight, but the duck tasted normal, nothing special.  The sushi was pretty average.  The chinese dishes were OK, but not fresh and crispy.  Seems that they're sitting for too long in the heating stations.  The decor is pretty interesting and the service was definitely great.  I'd go for 3.5 stars, but I'll give it 4 for the effort.  I heard their noodle soups were great, but was too full to try.  The deserts are pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is amazing and overwhelming. We were greeted at the door, and kindly shown to our seats, while being told about the specials and where the washrooms were. That was nice.   While walking to our tables, we had to walk through the buffet area. It seemed rather large with a lot of variety. Notable dishes were Peking Duck, special soup, and giant chicken wings! The prime rib was not bad either, and the sashimi was pretty good. They had sweet shrimp sashimi! Had to peel it myself but, meh. It tasted good.   The salad bar was a little pitiful, but I guess Asians don't like salad? Haha I don't know. I'm Asian, and I like salad.   On Friday's they have fresh oysters rather than crab legs, which would be my preference. But too bad I didn't get a chance to come in on Friday.   The crowd itself was rather.. unpleasant. A lot of pushy people, and rude. But this had nothing to do with the service or food.   I personally like Dragon Pearl better because it's basically the same but you get half a lobster. at $31.99, it's not a bad place to go for a special occassion. Seniors over 65 get 20% off their meal."}
{"text":"Not bad for a buffet, good if you have large groups of people with different tastes. But I'd rather go to specialty restaurants for better quality food. Their menu is always pretty much the same, so it gets old really fast. I like how the they have handmade fresh noodles, but the wait time is too long."}
{"text":"Seriously... What's not to like about this place?  The selection of food is huge - too large to list. There are some premium foods like sashimi (salmon and yellowtail when we were there - the latter is pretty rare for buffets), roasted duck (portion controlled per trip), raw oysters (portion controlled per trip), etc.  It's loud, busy, and crowded, but that's part of its atmosphere. If you want a quiet place and like being served, this is not the place for you.  I caught myself saying to my kids, \"Eat faster so you can eat more before your stomach tells you you are full.\" That's the truest sign of a good buffet."}
{"text":"Very spacious seating area but the parking space is limited. I went on a Wednesday night and had to park on the street. The place was very busy even on a weeknight - be sure to make a reservation. Oh, they also close at 9:30 on weeknights which is way too early.   The actual buffet area is relatively small compared to the extensive seating area (there are 3 sections). Ceilings are high and the dining area relatively dark for an asian buffet restaurant. It was a little too loud for conversation.   Food selection seems to be average but the sushi bar is quite remarkable for a buffet restaurant. Sashimi cuts are large and fresh. Depending on how busy it is, there may be staff serving the sashimi (and limiting how many you may get).  The peking duck was unremarkable but a nice addition to the buffet selection. Roast beef that night was great, as was the grill section. My family particularly liked the grilled shrimp and pineapple. The dim sum selection was average as was the Chinese dishes (sweet and sour pork, stir-fries...) The hand made noodles were great and you can choose from several soup bases.   Dessert section was very similar to what is offered at Mandarin. Chocolate dipped strawberries and creme brulee were prepared on site behind the dessert counter.   The food was good but does not justify the exorbitant price you have to pay. Great to try but would only return for special occasions."}
{"text":"As far as all you can eat Chinese buffet restaurants go, this is probably my favourite, along with their sister restaurant, Dragon Pearl. Having said that, I'm not a big fan of Asian buffet restaurants. I don't find the food as authentic as going to a dedicated Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, or Thai restaurant.  Dragon Legend does a lot of things well. The decor and ambiance are very upscale. For this visit, we had a lot of visitors from the US and they were very impressed. Compared to the AYCE Asian buffets they're used to, there were less choices but the food quality was much better. Having been to two of those places in Florida this year, I can attest to that.  The food stations at Dragon Legend include a salad bar, sushi station, hand-made noodles, grill, dim sum, desserts, ice cream, and more. For dinner, there's also Peking duck. It appears like they cook the food in smaller quantities and replenish often. It doesn't have time to get stale.  If you're looking for a Chinese buffet, try Dragon Legend."}
{"text":"This place is nice, but the service sucked! As we were being seated the waitress tells us there's a time limit. Wtf. The food area was small and the food selection was crap too. I kept walking around trying to decide what to eat because there wasn't much to choose from. I hate how they have to give you the Peking duck and you can't get it yourself. They only have cold crab and no hot crab. They guard the better food like they're serving a homeless shelter. Mandarin is so much better with so much more to eat! Better service too!"}
{"text":"Fathers day dinner at dragon legend last night. Food for the most part is pretty good in comparison to other buffets. Peeking duck is always a treat you don't see elsewhere. Mussels crab and the veggies are good quality. Only issue I had was the time limit. I get it that it was a busy night but the fact they were cleaning up the table while we were eating dessert I did not take kindly on. They are pricey in comparison to all other buffets already. Some consideration would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"Great place for family get together. Food is delicious especially their dragon noodle and Peking duck! I love their chocolate covered strawberries and the service is excellent. Their shows on Wednesday is very captivating as well!"}
{"text":"This review is for the full service dim sum lunch only.   We came for a dim sum lunch on Sunday.  The venue is spectacular. The theme is old time classy Chinese, with red, wood and black as main colors.  There is so much attention to details that the interior design is 5 stars on its own.  The food was delicately made and beautifully presented. They were tasty, relatively not oily and well seasoned.  The ingredients were fresh.  We ordered 5 dim sums and, even they were not as good as the ones at Elegance, I liked all of them.  As far as dim sum goes, Dragon Legend is well rounded.  We didn't order any Japanese food, so I can't comment on it.   The service is polite and attentive. The empty dishes were promptly removed.  One could say that it is very expensive food.  I would counter that this is the type of place that you buy the whole experience, not just the food.  This place deserves my 5 stars for full service dim sum lunch."}
{"text":"The stars are only for the decoration and service, foods are below average. Won't go again."}
{"text":"I find this location to be better than its sister location Dragon Pearl. There is a touch more variety and the food generally appears to be of slightly higher quality. The sashimi cuts are thick and fresh, I was very impressed with this for an AYCE buffet. I'd say the sashimi was better than most Japanese AYCE restaurants and almost comparable to what you'd get at an a la carte Japanese restaurant. There is a grilled meats section, but I'd recommend you pass on the chopped sirloin that they have available to order -- it was tough and dry, even though it wasn't overcooked. They ran out of the tofu dessert and never replenished it while I was there, even though I kept checking over 10-15 minutes. All in all, a couple misses here and there, but it's still definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and have always enjoyed the food.  I love the peking duck! There aren't a lot of AYCE that offer that. There is big variety of tasty Chinese and Japanese food. I loved the dessert too. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese Buffets go, this one is at the top of the list. Having grown up on the likes of Mandarin or Imperial Buffet, I've gotten used to mediocre buffet style food. Dry chicken, same old selection at every location. Then Dragon Pearl opened up near me, and now Dragon Legend.   Food - Dinner includes a fairly decent selection of sushi and sashimi (2 types - tako and salmon). Yes, it's fairly westernized sushi but all things considered it was pretty good. I was surprised they only had one noodle dish (vermicelli) plus the noodle soup station, but it was very good so I didn't even care that there wasn't any chow mein or anything else. They even served frog legs! The stations are nicely laid out so they didn't get too crowded, even when the restaurant is packed. Try the \"Mango Mango\" cocktail, it was delicious.  Layout - despite being HUGE, I found this restaurant easier to navigate than Dragon Pearl. It wasn't nearly as loud either, and more open in the \"main\" dining room. Still really dark in the rooms but seems to suit the ambiance. Washrooms were a bit strange, they are communal sinks with separate stalls.   Service - confusing whether we were supposed to wait for our original server to come back or if we could just grab anyone walking by. Ended up just asking random servers for drinks, and they were quick to bring it back to us.   Overall, this is my new favourite buffet!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here, especially the grilled foods (sweet potato mini cakes, grilled mushroom, etc).  Decent quality and selection.  They feature hand-pulled noodles cooked to order.    Beautiful decor and overall a great place to bring a party for buffet.  One thing I noticed though they took away my soups which were either new or unfinished.   No big deal, just got another one.  They also had two huge projection screens which could be a bit distracting if you're sitting between the two.  Quite busy even on weekday, which is good since the food remains fresh.  Prices are pretty decent.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"We were here to celebrate a birthday with family (6 adults, 3 kids) on a Saturday for 5:30 p.m. seating and it was crazy busy.  They insist on 2 hour time limit for each seating and that was fine by us as the vast dining room was already jam packed with people walking to and from the buffet.    The noodle bot was out of order when we were there which was a disappointment for the kids.  The spicy beef noodle soup I sampled was just ho hum for both broth and noodles.  The line ups at most popular stations like sushi & peking duck were plain silly so I opted out of the peking duck and just did sushi.  Selection is limited for both sushi and sashimi but it was pleasant to see Hamachi sashimi on the menu.  Sushies are on the small side.    They had more non-traditional buffet menus like braised pork hocks and oxtail stew...etc but I never got a chance to sample these as it was just too hard to get to the food with constant push and pull of other diners each battling for their share of food.    In all honesty, their food was no better than any other buffets I've been to but I have to say, the congestion and traffic at the buffet line at Dragon Legend was really something else.  I can't say I'd return to this place in a hurry.    Oh, they advertise \"Birthday person eats free with 4 paying adults\" on their website but they didn't honor that promotion saying it's not valid for a weekend dinner which is not listed anywhere on their website.  Cheap."}
{"text":"An AYCE chinese buffet. The ambience gave a historical and classy feel to the dining experience. The service was average as they fairly often checked on us for refills and clearing our table. On to the food, I feel like there isn't much of a selection of food compared to other buffet places. However, the quality is a bit better with the sashimi and peking duck being the highlights. There was of course a few asian fusion dishes that were just mediocre. The same goes to dessert. The selection of cakes available were a little on the dry side but still had some flavour. Overall, I might come back again for a fun family outing once in a while."}
{"text":"Great Chinese buffet. The selection is a bit limited compared to other large buffets, but the quality is so much better here. The decor is absolutely gorgeous and the interior has lots of seating. They definitely put Mandarin's buffet to shame lol."}
{"text":"Dragon Legend takes everything that's good about a buffet and puts it on steroids. The food selection is formidable while the flavours are excellent.   From Sea Bass, to Peking Duck, to Oxtail, to Sushi, to Stir Fry, to Dim Sum, this place has just about everything to suit every kind of taste, no matter how much of an culinary explorer you are. Even the dessert station is excellent. There's lots of seating here to boot and the decor really adds to the experience.   This place is kid friendly as well, which is a great bonus. Everybody was happy to accommodate our child and there was a high chair available.  If you're looking for a fun family place where you can stuff yourself silly, then this is the place for you. Just expect to gain a few pounds ... I know I did."}
{"text":"For my first time coming here, especially on a Monday evening (it's busy as hell) I am quite impressed with the amount of variety this place provides.   To begin, the design and aesthetics of the restaurant is different from your typical other ayce joints, there is a more majestic and oriental vibe to this place that incorporates some traditional design with modern design.  Generally, you can just say this place looks kinda 'FANCY' if you want to put it in that way.   There is a pretty spacious entrance area, which I found very intriguing since some other ayce entrances are quite small. But enough about the general layout and how the place looks time to critique the food.   First thing I personally enjoyed very much about this place is the variety of how many items of different kinds of food you can choose from. You are able to pick from japanese food ( all the standard sushi rolls, sashimi, tempura) alot of different choices of chinese food ( fried rice, noodles, asparagus,sweet and sour pork,) lots of grilled meats such as sausages, steaks, short ribs, chicken and etc. Plus there is the peking duck which I found was quite tasty for a buffet quality. That was one of the most interesting and favorable things about this place. I very much enjoyed the peking duck and the quality of it, I thought it was very fresh and not like some other trays of food were it's been sitting on the pan for awhile where it becomes soggy and dry. Also the fact that its ayce peking duck too which makes it better since that's a pricy item to eat at chinese restaurants, but this place doesn't limit you on how much you eat. So if your a PEKING DUCK FANATIC and eat,dream and sleep about peking duck then you better come here and chow down!!!!   Also there is bubble tea which you can order for an additional cost. I don't remember how much it costs but it was ok. I had gotten just a black milk tea with tapioca. Pretty large portion in terms of the glass they had given me. Taste wise was just ok but I don't think people would really come to this place to get bubble tea or expect it to taste as good as the bubble tea shops outside. So, not really caring on how the quality the drink is.   They do have a last call notice to let people know when they are planning on closing up shop which I find is a good idea so that people can go for their final rounds and overstuff  themselves *no pun intended*   I had went with a few friends and overall my first experience of this place was very positive despite the price per person is $26 which is kinda steep IMO but I guess for that amount you pay the trade off is, there is a ton of choices of different food you can choose from, so it is worth the money to go. UNLESS  your a big critic and your expectations are set way high above the bar and looking to be blown away by this place, you will probably be disappointed and perhaps you shouldn't be eating at AYCE's anyways lol.   Most definitely would return to this place again, in the meantime need to work out and burn off all that food until the next time ;)"}
{"text":"A typical AYCE buffet which is very similar to Dragon Pearl, its sister restaurant. The price is not very appealing but opted to try it since it was for Chinese New Year's dinner with my relatives.   It was $30.99 per person and there is discount for seniors over 65 with valid ID. Just thought it would useful to mention. As for qualify of service, typical service where they rush around and at times was difficult to get their attention.   Food quality was meh, similar to other buffets but the one thing I thought was interesting was the noodle bar. They have the option to choose type of noodle, soup base and which meat you would like as well. I got the spinach noodles with spicy soup base with duck. That was the highlight of the meal.  Oh and as for desserts, it was nothing special. I tried various desserts and was disappointed. Yes there was a fair selection but nothing impressive."}
{"text":"5 Stars for selection, taste, and value.   Now don't get me wrong. Like any AYCE and buffet places, there's some hits and some misses. But majority of items were made standard at worst, and some were made really well.   I loved the Chinese stir fried dishes section. I wish I can cook like this. Flavours are wonderful, texture is great and crunch is found where crunch is due in veggies while tenderness is found in the meats, fried rice was satisfying and you may be wondering why eat fried rice at a AYCE place? Well because it looked good and then I found out it tasted good too!  Sushi section provides a few choices of rolls and fish. I only really care for salmon and I found theirs to be pretty fresh for a buffet.   Noodle soup section was a great discovery. The homemade noodles are cooked perfectly \"Q\" and the beef soup is absolutely delicious. I want some right now!   Peking duck is a highlight, so is soy bean curd with brown sugar syrup, so is the taro and sago soup, so is sesame ice cream! Okay the dessert table(s) really rocks here!!   Atmosphere is airy, space is big, and decor is dark and traditional Chinese regal. Great for group dinners."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family, definitely very expensive...But you do get a good selection. It's a good place if u all have different preferences because u can all eat whatever u like. The Peking duck was surprisingly very good. Sashimi is pretty good, enough to make ur tastebuds happy (salmon is still on the fatty side though).  I love the sweet shrimp here. They also have good grilled pineapples haha. I came on a Saturday so there were crab legs. A lot of people enjoy them but I personally really didn't. They're frozen crabs so they're mushy and super watery. Black sesame and green tea ice cream tastes like the Hime brand which is good. They have a ton of dessert. There's also ginseng soup and tofu pudding which are pretty popular."}
{"text":"We ate here while in the area... Really good food... Amazing atmosphere. A little pricey but to be honest nothing to. Complain about. Our 8 year old ate free if we paid debit or cash which was a bonus. Authentic food done right. I would recommend this place forsure...  100% 10 stars"}
{"text":"We used to go to Dragon Pearl a lot until we found Dragon Legend. I don't know if they are related, but their interior decoration is very similar.  Very elegant Chinese traditional color and furniture. I like the location because we live in North and it is just a little south of HWY7, cross the street of Costco.  After we had a very big meal, we walked to Costco to shop. They also have a lot of food items, especially sashimi and sushi, peking roasted duck with wrap, hand tossed noodle are our favorite just like Dragon Pearl. So it is now our number 1 go to place whenever we feel like buffet. The opening hours are listed incorrectly on Yelp."}
{"text":"Good but a bit overpriced at 31 per person. Lots of pictures of delicious looking food here that we didn't see tonight. The Peking duck, sashimi and fresh noodles were a treat."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I never thought highly of Asian buffets, especially when it comes to the ranks of Mandarin. My parents insisted we try this place, despite my moderate resistance into eating Chinese-inspired Asian buffets; I tend to prefer Japanese or purely Euro-western AYCE places.  This place, I shall begin, is an epic maze. I counted four completely separated sections of where you can be seated, and I actually got lost trying to find my parents at first (I went to the washroom while they were seated, thinking it wouldn't be difficult to find them). You can have a table to yourself, or you can opt to share a table with others, similar to busy Chinese restaurants such as New City.  The food options here are extensive for lunch. There is everything ranging from noodle bowls to dim sum to sushi to soups to BBQ, Asian desserts, regular desserts, etc. If you love Asian food there's guaranteed to be something there for you!  I give high marks to the dim sum, noodle bowls, BBQ, and Asian desserts (tofu flower and the green bean paste). I particularly loved the BBQ pork, sweet chicken teriyaki, har gow, siu mai, and the pork noodle soup they had. The sushi and regular desserts on the other hand were not up to par (they only had rolls and not actual sushi and the desserts tasted way off).  Finally service, considering the place is huge, was very good! There were always servers available despite the section you're in. They also kindly informed us that since it was the Tuesday $10.99 lunch special, only cash or debit was accepted.  I'm still not a fan of Chinese-style Asian buffets, but for those who do like that style this place is miles ahead of Mandarin in that category."}
{"text":"I went to Dragon Legend on Sunday night. From Dec 6-31, 2017, there are some special promotions every night. For sunday nights, every costumer can get a lobster tail and two grilled scallops! I strongly recommend to make a reservation early before you go. When I sat down on a table, the waiter gave me a voucher for lobster tail and scallops.   Besides nightly specials, its popular food is Peking duck!! I have to say, it is the best I have tried ever! Skin was so crispy and no fat under the skin, and the meat was juicy. The line for Peking duck was always long! But the bad thing is you would get full so quickly.  Their seafoods were good, different ways to cook. But the options of desserts and ice cream were a bit less than I expected.  The price was not cheap! It was $36.99 for dinner and $27.99 for lunch. Basically I would say it is the top price among buffet restaurants."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! This is definitely a good Chinese buffet for those who like variety. I've been to the sister restaurant, and this definitely is better than the other one (it's also more expensive!).  The decor was fantastic and the tall ceilings made the place seem huge.  Seems like the building was previously a warehouse perhaps. There are two large screens in the main dining area which plays loops of videos related to Chinese food and culture. Quite impressive. The restaurant wasn't that busy yet as we arrived at 6pm.  The servers were attentive and quick with taking our empty plates away.  The food was good, and the variety was there. The peking duck was probably my fave! The hot and sour soup was flavourful and the sushi was about the same as any average sushi restaurant. I was hoping to have some toro sashimi but they had only hamachi.  I think that the variety could be more considering how grand this place is. Perhaps more soup and noodle options, and maybe even lobster? They have some seafood like crab legs, fried oysters, mussels and shrimp though.   The price was $31.99 for a weekend dinner. Looks like the price increased in the last year after reading other reviews.   I'd probably come back, but only for a special occasion with my family/parents perhaps."}
{"text":"Simply the best Asian AYCE buffet restaurant I have ever been to.  Try it...you'll probably like/love it!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here on Sunday and First of all, let me say, there was so much hype about this place but I found it to be mediocre. The decor in this place is outstanding though, very creative but their buffet setup was poorly done. Between this buffet and their sister Dragon Pearl, I would prefer Dragon Pearl. The food was alright. Nothing really that spectacular. Service was ok too. I had high hopes about this place after reading so many great reviews but was disappointed with my experience there. I probably won't be back and will just stick to Mandarin lol"}
{"text":"My first time here having very high expectation from all my friends who recommended. Came here for lunch on Thursday and first walking in, it was kind of  medievalish/chinese which was pretty neat and unique and exceeded my expectation. We were seated with 2 large projectors showing chinese television on both sides of the restaurant  Now with the food and honestly I thought their buffet selection was very limited even for lunch and rather a small buffet area in such a large restaurant....tried the dim sum which they had about 8-9 choices, they were all pretty crappy quality and reminded me of those frozen dim sums u buy at the supermarket....the noodle bar was pretty neat seeing the cook slicing the noodles but I would question the cleanliness as they did not wear any gloves while cutting the noodle that touches their hand and picking out our toppings....I didn't find the noodles to be outstanding.....the hot stuff was very limited, they had a dish with snow peas and bacon?!?!?!? Ewwwww, the sweet and sour pork was more like sweet and sour FAT, their sesame chicken was so over fried and barely any chicken, the only good stuff was the fish and fried rice  Their sushi was terrible, I can't believe they can serve that, it's one of the worst sushi I ever had....their dessert area was quite extensive that had cakes, cookies and pastry....oh yea they also had ice cream too which was pretty good, other than that this was a pretty crappy buffet....even mandarin is better  Service was mediocre, had to wait 15mins for my matcha milk shake Will not be returning ever"}
{"text":"Peaking duck is so highlight, overall is good for groups ppl. But I will take a break to go again. First time I love it but second time is good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a buffet since my early adolescent years when my mother would try to disguise me as a 9 year old to get the discounted kids pricing. After hearing a lot of rave about the decor and this place I recommended a friend visiting from China to dine here with me.  The decor was indeed quite bold and interesting. The ceiling is high and made for comfortable seating. It was odd because the decor is very traditional Chinese but they have huge TVs playing a baseball game.  The stars are given pretty much only for the decor. The food was less than impressive. Everything tastes like a 3/10 - either over cooked and under flavoured. The sushi sashimi fish tasted very fishy.   Bonus info: little kids eat for $2.99, yes, two dollars and ninety nine cents. That's the silver lining I guess..."}
{"text":"A little pricey but a good buffet place with lots of food variety. Everyday has their specialty added to the menu. There a different sushi and sashimi, a bar for cold seafood like mussels and shrimp, hot food, grillled food, dimsum, noodle soup and dessert.   Most of the food taste good, i try a little mostly of everything. They serve peking duck, 2 portion each time. I always go back for more. 4 slices of salmon sashimi at a time, it is thickly cut and very fresh. I also go back for more. Lol!  Coconut soup with tapioca is my favorite dessert.  Place is always busy so better call for reservations. Very nice ambiance brings you back to China's palace during the olden days. Very nice for special occasion celebration. Good for groups. Staff are nice and place is kept clean.  ***Tuesday specials is cheaper every week"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the interior design. The restaurant was huge and I was scared of getting lost!  They have a huge selection of food including pizza, sushi, hand shaved noodle, peking duck and sashimi just to name a few. I was excited to try the peking duck because it's one of my favourite thing in the world. I had to say I was slightly disappointed because the pancake and the duck meat was a bit too thick and dry. However, I thought that the hand shaved noodle was done very well and the broth was very flavourful. There was also an assortment of sashimi to try from and although it was cut thick, it tasted quite fresh.  I'm not a buffet goer so I wouldn't come back here. However, for those who love buffets, I don't think this place would disappoint."}
{"text":"Was here for a birthday celebration and we sat at this longggggg table near the back.   The food isn't bad. Everything was freshly made and some were made to order. The Peking duck was pretty good, better than some restaurants. Sashimi was fresh, salad was fresh. The shrimp at the salad bar is a pretty good size and was fresh. The prime roast was also pretty good. Moist and had a nice pink color. The dessert table had a good variety. Creme Brule had a nice crust.  The service was night and day between two servers. One of them was nice and attentive, she even gave me a free refill on my cold osmanthus tea. While the other server just seemed annoyed to be working or was having a bad day.   Overall for a buffet this place isn't bad at all but I prefer the one at york mills more. I think it's the decor but this restaurant seems to be much noisier than the other one. I also felt the other restaurant has more variety."}
{"text":"My fav buffet place for celebrations in the area, the noodle is the best. Much better variety and quality than mandarin. Tuesday night specials are cheap but not worth it. You have to park on the street a good 10 mins away. They swap the good stuff out. Definitely go the show Thursdays or the weekends."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Sunday $31.99. Snow crab leg included. The salmon shashimi is really thick and fresh. And great decor. The restaurant is separated into different dinning rooms with the food in the middle. Great for groups or private events."}
{"text":"Booked a group luncheon here for 30 people and secured a private (VIP) room. Speaking Chinese helps here, and as such they were easy to work with on the phone long-distance for the reservation. Also dropped by locally to confirm details which was beneficial as we discovered that there were cash payment options to secure discounted rates. For large reservations in the VIP room, they requested a $100 deposit in advance. It was $27 including everything for each adult (less for kids and toddlers). As for the actual meal experience, the options were plentiful and everything tasted good. Standouts were the fresh, homemade hand-pulled noodles in the soup, some of the grill items (salmon, beef, etc), and peking duck. The interior and furniture decor is very ornate and high-end, like a Chinese palace. Service was good and there were no issues with the bill. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Every year we come to Dragon Legend at least once for either a special occasion and this year the trend continues with an Christmas dinner, yes you heard me, \"Christmas\" not \"Happy Holiday\" dinner:)  As far as buffets go, this is probably one of the best Asian one in the GTA.  The decor here is just as over the top as their original location Dragon Pearl.  Pretty much everything here is done really well.  The serving trays are much smaller then most places so the food is turned over often and fresh.  Some highlights include some really good quality sashimi, Peking duck, and their \"Dragon Noodles\".  Do be aware they get slammed on weekends especially during the holiday season so reservations are a must.  We went for an early 5pm dinner and by the time we left the place was slammed by 7pm!  Overall a solid choice for Asian buffet!"}
{"text":"Been here about 4 times. The selection for sushi is very surprising. See pics. Food is good. Great for big groups!! One of the better buffets.  Service is good! Craving to go back soon!!"}
{"text":"First meal of 2014! As yearly tradition, first of the new year is always dim sum with the family. After visiting Premier and Paradise combined 4 times this break, my fiancé's parents was worried that we would be sick of the selection or dim sum altogether. They decided to take us to the newly opened Dragon Legend - they thought even if food doesn't wow us, at least we will be taken by the decor!   The decor was the same exact outlandish style Dragon Pearl had. Emperor chairs by the restroom, extremely tall seat backrests, ridiculously small candle size tea cups, throw in a few golden dragon statues here and there. The dining space was huge and yet packed on this early afternoon. We managed to skip the 1 hr wait thanks to my fiancé's dad awesome network (he somehow knows all the right ppl).   After receiving our Oonlong tea, we quickly  turned in our marked order sheet where our server brought over to the register to record and relay it to the kitchen. He soon came back with the receipt which we found impressive because it listed all the items - subsequently each time our dim sum order was delivered, the next server was able to easily identify and stamp the item as served. So much more organized than other dim sum places we've been to where they just scribble and write on all over when we wanted to take off or add on items!   The food was pretty ok but for the price - about $5-6 for just your normal dish of chicken feet or Siu mui - honestly not worth it. There wasn't even one single dish that I'm dying to return for or have a second time. The egg tart barely had any egg. The custard bun's yolk filling was overly salted. The regular and abalone siu Mai and scallop + shrimp dumplings were quite flavorless. U can get way better fried turnip cakes in XO sauce in Congee Wong. The lychee flower cake tasted like straight sugar jello. The unagi seafood tarts - what seafood? U mean minced pork? The only item I did enjoy was the almond custard ball with a layer of crunchy almond shavings - a bit oily but it was unique.  Perhaps since it was New Years and they were overwhelmed by the number of tables, the service was meh. We didn't have any water or tea through most of the meal. I didn't get my mustard til I got my sweets. Our lotus wrapped rice came after we paid our bill and had doggie bagged everything else. Perhaps we should return for their dinner buffet to give this place another try. But after sampling their chefs cooking thru dim sum brunch and experiencing their much needed additional service training or hiring, we won't be hurrying back."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Chinese buffet restaurants I've been too. Great selection of sushi as well as Chinese and non-Chinese items. The General Tao chicken is amazing as is the seaweed salad which I surprisingly liked. They also offer sugar free desserts which I thought was great.  Decor is amazing!  Price is a little high, but on par with places like Mandarin and Imperial Buffet."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow.  I went with a small group of friends here on a Monday night, and I was shocked to see how packed this place got. Mind you, they have capacity for over 200 people, at least. And PACKED.   The service was nice, nothing special. They were rather timely with our drink orders and coming by to take away our plates, replenish our iced tea, etc. By the end of the night, however, they got a bit slower, assuming because of all the people that were leaving and their tables needing to be completely cleared up.  The food was absolutely amazing. Frog legs, sesame chicken, Chinese greens, curried fish balls, all kinds of sushi, and all kinds of stir frys. I managed to go for three rounds of dishes, as well as a soup, and dessert. Everything was excellent, except of the dessert. They had a variety of options, but the best thing ended up being the simple ice cream. And they had some real wonky flavours, besides the usual strawberry, mango and chocolate - they had ginger and SESAME. It was GREY. Looked like we were eating cement. My friends loved it, but I couldn't quite enjoy it as much. After all, I was eating cement-looking frozen sesame mixed with milk.  Anyhoo, overall, definitely a great place to visit with a group, I'd highly recommend it. It was around $35 with the tip and all, so not quite cheap, but if you can stuff your face, it's totally worth the money.  Oh, also, the place looks very nice visually. All kinds of crazy looking Chinese furniture (not sure how authentic it is or not), and they were showing on two huge projection screens some Chinese tourist promo videos. The videos did get old after two hours of the same (15 minutes) being screened in loop, but it was overall a nice visual experience to be in the restaurant.  Definitely will visit again when I can justify spending $35 on a dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food good selection. Traditional Asian food. Service is so friendly especially this one girl. Don't know her name but she is great. My pop had no bubbles she brought me a ice tea the ice tea was all sugar. She was very nice to take it away. Think there pop machine might be out of whack.  Absolutely love the way they Serve tea. Love it!!!  Overall great place for fast traditional Asian food. And a variety so everyone can pick what they want.  Get here early though or you will be waiting a while for oysters and peeking duck."}
{"text":"This buffet is amazing! The interior is very nice, food is delicious. And their Peking duck is the best! If you don't feel like AYCE just order something for take-out or delivery. We always do that with Peking duck. Great place!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best asian buffets I've ever been to. The whole restaurant was very nice and large. The decor was fantastic.   Lots of selections of food. There is a soup station which I loved. I got spicy beef soup with wontons. It was sooooooooooooo good!!   They also had a sushi bar. Everything I got from it was fresh which is pretty surprising for a sushi bar.   Lots of shumai and dim sum to choose from. Great selections of everything else too!! They also had a grill bar where they grilled items like lotus chicken, udon noodles in spicy sauce and scallion pancakes.  Tons of desserts and there is also a ice cream station!   Next time I go to Canada I will definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now with identical results and it's essentially a different version of the Mandarin, so let's go over how they were.  Atmosphere: Honestly, it's pretty cozy.  The dining room is large and there aren't really walls.  Tables are pretty far apart too.  Only downside is that because it can get pretty busy and there are no walls, it gets very loud, making it hard to communicate with your waiter / waitress or people that you are having a meal with.  Food: It's a little up and down.  Some of the food had differing taste / flavour on my two visits so it's not super consistent.    Service: Mediocre at best.  I don't actually recall any waitor / waitress checking up on us once during my first visit - they'd just pick up the plates when we weren't at the table.  No communication, no \"how is the food\", etc.  Some of the stations also need to be more looked after as the dining room, unsurprisingly, can get a little messy with so many people dining in.  I've found that at some of the stations, some of the people preparing the food can start to get lazy and thus, make little effort at presentation or making food at all.  Or just straight up leave it to get cold without replacing it.  Price: $35 per adult from Fridays to Sundays and holidays.  That's a high cost for mediocre food and below average service.  Other: Parking is pretty atrocious so I would highly recommend going early.  Also: They close at 10:00pm on weekdays.  While getting \"in\" might not be a problem, the service starts to nosedive when it starts to get close to closing.  That's WAY too early, especially if your service is going to drop that much.  The place gets VERY busy and without a reservation, you're going to need to wait a while to get in.  So make one for sure.  Due to the high cost, mediocre food and bad service, I really don't think I'll be going unless it's a special occasion with family.  There are better options out there and pretty much every shortcoming is solved by going elsewhere."}
{"text":"In terms of a buffet experience this one tops them all. From the atmosphere to the selection and quality I highly recommend giving this place a try.   I'm not a big fan of buffets but I'd definitely visit this one again. What really impressed me was that they weren't cheap with the ingredients. Peking duck wraps are a must and a couple trips to the sushi bar is inevitable. Watching cooks shave uncooked noodles into a massive wok of boiling water in the the traditional style was a nice touch.  They also have big projection screens playing videos of people preparing food for important festivals so there an educational element as well.   Very decadent and immersive; will be back."}
{"text":"Good Chinese buffet restaurant. Great decor and friendly wait staff.  They have the typical buffet items such as fried chicken wings. The dim sum and Suishi were good much better than Mandirin restaurants.  Will return if I get the chance."}
{"text":"Dragon legend is probably the best chinese buffet out there.  Very clean, spacious and the decor is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews are so high at Dragon Legend. It's a 3 star at best.   I hated the parking. That parking lot needs to be bigger or something. We weren't able to find a spot and had to park on the street (Cochrane Drive). Went here with a large group. The food wasn't that spectacular (think Mandarin, etc.). Lots of people went straight for the peking duck (that was just ok). I found the rolls most disappointing of all. The dessert wasn't impressive either. There was definitely lots of variety though and you would leave stuffed though not completely satisfied.   The staff always cleared our things asap."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group of 25 people.  We had a reservation.    I love the decor and food selection.  Food itself was very good, but I don't like their system for the sashimi.  You can only have a certain amount of each item and you are given every sashimi they have, per visit to the station.  I'm not a particular fan of salmon sashimi, but given it every time even if I said no salmon.  My biggest problem was with my large group, they didn't put us all in one table.   We weren't even split evenly.  Majority of the group was at one table, while 4 people sat at another table to the side of us.  We were there to celebrate, and I felt like I was leaving a few of my guests out."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations but it just didn't meet my demands. The duck was delicious however, the service was absolutely disgusting. We came late to the reservation and as of a result, I expected that we would have to rush. However, what I didn't expect was how the staff told us to hurry despite the restaurant not being too busy. They were eyeballing us and although it was our fault, did not treat us as customers. In the end, the food was ok however, the service is absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Used to be an ok restaurant, but things have changed. It is like the combination of food court restaurants, with a higher price, much higher, and full of greasy food that makes you feel full very quickly. They even try to control the duck portion, probably the only thing that seems ok. You have to tell them how many portions you want every time you want to get it, and they will give it to you. I don't even want the wrap because it is thick, full of flour, and taste horribly. I only want the duck, but it is not an option I suppose. Terrible service, with coupon, they said I have to pay with cash, and cash only. They try to push you to buy drink even before you take your seat. $25 for lunch before tax is an insane price, especially for the food they offer. Definitely not return."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Chinese buffets that I have been to in terms of food and aesthetics. The restrooms were clean and modern. A big difference from most Chinese buffets that I have been to.   There were no issues with parking. We came here for dinner on 7/24/17 and the staff was friendly. The price was affordable. The bill came to $125 for four people (only drank water and tea). The duck  is something to die for. Would certainly come back. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Fast food quality. Sushi was ok everything else was Greasy canadian Chinese and a large selection of other gross foods. It's like mandarins downsy sibling dressed up like a wrestler.  Yorkshire pudding was awful All the meats were super greasy and heavy Little vegetable selection Frog legs are sick, I feel like a monster now. Instant regret  Weird,   What did I expect for an all you can eat buffet?!?. I feel fat and tired now, my stomach aches and I parted with thirty dollars to feel this way.  :( I won't go back.. Not now , not never, no way man... Learn from my pain . Ps luchadores and dragons have nothing to do with each other and the only legend in that joint was me."}
{"text":"Where does the food stop? This place was great! They had a wonderful variety of food and everything was high quality. I thought I saw everything but somehow missed the grilled pineapples until the end! The sushi was delicious and there were so many kinds to choose from. The dessert area was a heaven of different little cakes, flan, creme brûlée, etc... The whole restaurant was themed as well, with carved bamboo animals, an assortment of ornate chairs, and other distinct designs. One thing I will note is that it can get crowded on Saturday nights, so get ready to do some serious plate dodging! This was one of the best buffets I have come across."}
{"text":"It's been quite awhile since I ventured to this side of town, but had to give this place a try.  Prior to eating here, the only other buffet I have eaten at was Mandarin or Imperial Buffet. I'm not really a buffet type of guy, but it had been awhile, and i read good things about this place so why not.  First impression was holy red!! This colour really dominated. I really liked the ambience of this place, it wasn't as crowded as I expected on a Friday night which was a welcome relief. We got seated right away.   The server explained to us exactly what was special on the buffet today, and Peking Duck and Noodle Soup & Oysters!  I always believe in pacing yourself when at a buffet, but that soon went out the window. The food was very flavourful, loved the Peking duck, Beef, BBQ Pork. i also had some Oysters! Food was better quality then the Mandarin and Imperial Buffet by far.  After about 4 plates I was done! Great place will surely come again. It is a bit on the pricey side $35 per person, but other than that, great place to eat."}
{"text":"The Dragon legend mirrors the food coming from other ayce establishments like The Mandarin. The difference lies in both the quality of food that is served and the atmosphere you are in.   Its almost overwhelming, how cool this place looks inside! I am a huge fan of the entire space. The food area isn't huge by any means, but there are lots and lots of options to choose from. The sushi selection is large and the sashimi is great but the rolls are not the best. I am not too disappointed though because afterall, this is an ayce chinese restaurant, not a sushi joint.   Peking duck here is VERY popular. The lineup at some points in the night was outrageous! I have had it before and I must say its quite good. Obviously, as with the sushi, specialty restaurants may do a better job at it but this was more than good enough.   Noodle soup is something that I am always drawn too. I was very pleased to see the cooks pulling the fresh noodles and cooking them right before serving it. They have a great bite to them, just how I like it! They are chewy and I definitely had more than just a couple bowls. I also really liked the fact that you could choose any combination of broth and meat- so many noodle soup possibilities!!  The dessert section was pretty large. There were a selection of cakes, ice creams, pies, and other traditional chinese desserts. I am a fan of tofu with syrup so I was really happy to find it here.   Overall the food is very good, but unless you get your fair share of sashimi, crablegs, peking duck or some other particularly expensive food, the price is a bit high. In my case, I make sure to have my fair share of these foods so the price is justified :) With that being said, I will be back again."}
{"text":"This place will surely put you in a blissful state of food coma.  Hits: -Peking duck wraps -Salmon sashimi: each piece melts in your mouth -Noodles in a spicy beef soup: this is very spicy though! -Noodles and a duck piece in a chicken broth soup -General Tso's Chicken -Har gow -Crème brûlée -Sesame ice cream  Misses: -Sweet and sour pork -Beef short ribs (Kalbi): chewy meat and too much fat -Crab legs: cold and bland -Tuna sashimi -White tuna sashimi -Barbeque pork: dry -Siu mai   Interesting notes: -They had kimchi, a Korean fermented cabbage side dish -There are big screens with CCTV, which I assume is a Chinese TV channel, playing  Weekend dinner buffet cost $32.99 per person."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my parents! Lunch is dim sum while dinner is buffet @$29.99 per person!  Awesome decor! Very modern contemporary style dim sum! Very good service! Possibly best trained staff outside of Asia! They were courteous and polite an help refill ur tea! The place is huge! Food was pretty good! A bit on the pricey side but with the atmosphere, the decor and te service along with creative dim sum (they also do sushi a la carte after 11am) it's to be expected!  Approximately $3.20-$7.20 per dish! Sushi are little on the high side considering this isn't even a sushi restaurant! But def worth a try!"}
{"text":"my second time here at this yummy buffet and no it is not Mandarin Chinese style, it's got some REAL authentic Chinese dishes! From the traditional peking duck, to the steamed herbal soup for \"longevity\" and we could all use some longevity am I right??  It's the sister restaurant of Dragon Pearl, so same decor, layout and food almost but better.  I would suggest coming at the beginning of meal times because near the middle-end of the lunch/dinner rush, they do not refill the stations as well or the food is not pipping hot/freshly made.   The tea is extra and it's served in an artful clear pot on a warming candle with these tiny glass cups which my friends swore were the tea light votives. Amateurs! They are green tea shot cups, duh. It'll save you more room for food =)"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night so parking was not a problem at all.  Then I realized why, because we paid the same price as Friday and Saturday but we don't have any specials.  Especially I was doing the 7:30pm round, the food stopped being refilled around 9, that means we don't have 2 full hours to eat like the 5:30pm round.  A lot of desserts ran out and they said they won't fill it anymore.  And they started cleaning and packing, that kind of giving you a sign to leave.    If you go I suggest to do the earlier round, at least the 2 hours you have will have good being served for the whole time.    Food is ok, I guess comparing to most Chinese buffet this is not bad.  The variety is plenty.  But I don't think it's worth the new price of $34 per person."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, similar to Dragon Pearl.   We've been here multiple times. The latest was a weekend lunch for my mother's wedding reception. Very impressed that the restaurant was able to accommodate 250 guests (half the restaurant).   Food was good, great variety. Lines can get a bit long, and sometimes chaotic. I hate buffets for that reason; you're in line, waiting for the person in front of you to finish scooping their food, when suddenly someone decides to swoop in the opening.   There are huge projectors plying weird videos. One day it was a hip-hop dance competition. Another was a Chinese singing contest. hmm."}
{"text":"Love love love this buffet spot!  You definitely need reservations, and it doesn't matter when you go, there will always be food lines, but they move quickly!  Food is often replenished and hot!  They have an amazing Japanese sashimi and rolls section.  They always have the Peking duck slicers in the middle.  They also have a section for freshly cut noodles.  The dessert buffet is super sweet.  :)  Always looking forward to this place so that everyone gets what they want!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I made reservations for my birthday for 30 ppl and they told me prior that I will have a separate room but I need to put a $100 deposit down to secure the room. We needed a separate room away from people because of the strollers and little kids running around. When we got there, I was puzzled to learn that we were sharing a room with 4 other families. I made the reservations a month in advance and the tables were far from each other, I felt disconnected from my family and friends.   The server sucked. Kept bothering me about who ordered what drinks, how should I know when I am not sitting with them.. It was his job to write down the bills and take orders accordingly.   The food was alright. Nothing to rave about. I think their sister location Dragon Pearl is so much better, with food and service! Dragon Legend, the food was super salty, did not enjoy my food at all.   I don't think I will be coming here again. I loved it the first time I came here but seems like the food and service went down.  Come super early to get parking and make reservations ahead of time!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the setting was dangerous. They sat us at the only table with these short, round, bowed chairs (instead of the tall, heavy wooden chairs) beside the stage. Well two kids had their chairs fall back, and the kids hit their heads on the floor and stairs.  They should get rid of those chairs, as it was very dangerous for all,. Even one of the adults also almost fell out of their chairs as they tried to move their chair back to get out. After the two accidents and kids crying, they replaced our chairs with the tall, heavy ones."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets around here. Also one of the more expensive ones ($32.99 Fri, Sat, Sun & Holidays).  Interior is beauuutiful. Way better than Mandarins...-_- The food selection was big. Dim Sum, Sushi, Grilled stuff, dessert..etcetc. But as expected the  food was only decent. Nothing amazing. Maybe because I'm Chinese and I'm not a big fan of Westernized Chinese food. As a child my mama would tell me to avoid eating anything with rice and noodles in it. Such as fried rice, fried noodle, noodle soup, and sushi. Because 1. It fills you up too fast and 2. Rice and noodle dishes are cheap to make. You won't be able to eat your money's worth if you stuff yourself with rice and noodles. Since I'm a rebellious child, I never listen. I love eating Dragon Legend's hand pulled noodles. I gotta admit, out of all the food they have.. this has got to be the best! You have to try those noodles!  Overall, we had a great time but unless for a family gathering, I don't think I would return considering it's quite expensive and I don't eat much. But I must agree that this is the best buffet around here."}
{"text":"came here on a friday night. friday night is raw oyster night. they only serve 2 at a time so you'll have to make multiple trips to make it worth it lol.  most of my meal consisted of raw oysters with seafood sauce and a squirt of lemon juice, fried oysters, sashimi, mussels, shrimp and peking duck.  the fried oysters were pretty good. fatty as you'd expect and big. 5 different selections of sashimi which as far as i know, is a bigger selection compared to the other buffets in the area.  mussels you can have cooked with the black bean sauce or served cold with the seafood sauce. lots of different shrimp options. shrimp sashimi, unpeeled shrimp you can peel for shrimp cocktail (i know some of you are too lazy to peel it yourself), grilled shrimp skewers as well. peking duck was great, they serve you it so it's quick, and very nice pieces of duck.  after my main meal, i had some fruits. grilled pineapple, watermelon, honeydew. then indulged in some sweets just to try it since i don't really have a sweet tooth. i had the flan, fruit tarts, chocolate covered strawberry, creme brulee, and jello cus i love jello. desserts were pretty standard nothing that really wowed me. except the waffles. the waffles were so light and fluffy on the inside and had the crunch to it on the outside. they also had traditional chinese desserts like the red bean pastes and tofu flower. i was too full to make it to the ice cream bar.  the decor was something i really enjoyed. and i had nothing to complain about in regards to the service. enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I would only come to Dragon Legend for the all you can eat Peking duck, and sweet shrimp, yellow tail sashimi. The crab legs are average. The short ribs are good. A few scallop/shrimp stir fry dishes were decent.  I am ok in indulging in a handful of food I really like, but if you're looking for a lot of variety in dishes - this is not the place."}
{"text":"Okay to be honest this is the best buffet I've been to. Great selection. Oysters on fridays!! I love the dragon noodles and it is cool to watch them hand shave the noodles as well! I love when they have squid sashimi and I think they have a much better and different selection than any of your other buffets. The atmosphere is cool and a great place to bring family or have a party. Another nice addition is the peking duck, delicious."}
{"text":"Ok, so after my lunch review, it is time to do the dinner review. Once the sunset, the dim sum resturant transforms to a buffet. If you seen my review before, you notice the star rating is.... the same.  Decor, please read my previoua review, food, hum..... Fried fish taste bitter. Steak is over cook. Sushi and sushami, soso, not the best, not the worst. The key to sushi is freshness and this place didnt not live up to its look. Don't attempt the cake, green tea cakes doesn't have green tea taste, cheese cake is not made of cream cheese, and the chocolate cake is made of cake mix from no frills.  There are some good news however, the Japanese steak and the noodle are both made on the spot. Not a lot of buffet does that. Specially the noodle, hand cut on the spot and serve directly.   In conclusion, don't expect an epic buffet because they charge an epic price. Stay away from the fried fish, as the guy grilling the steak to serve earlier if you like rare and the noodle is a must have.   Once again Dragon Legend, you are STILL not a legend."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, I'm a fan of this one. My appreciation for buffets has diminished over the years (that metabolism, I tell ya...not how it used to be!) but when you've got fresh sashimi, Peking duck, handmade noodles in soup, right in front of you? Golden.  The highlights here are distinguished by the crowds or lines forming around them. The handmade noodles, for example, usually has a line wrapped around the corner. They have white noodles and green \"spinach\" noodles, and you can choose chicken broth or fish broth (CHOOSE THE FISH), adding bbq pork, or bbq duck (OR BOTH!).   Another kickass thing they have is truly authentic sesame and ginger ice cream. Never do I see these at a buffet, and they go well with the waffles! They also have some very silky and delish tofu dessert, or dau fu fa. The dessert station in general is quite good!  Overall a yummy dining experience. The downside is that it attracts hordes of people, so protect your elbows walking through the crowd...you don't want to drop anything!"}
{"text":"This is the best ayce restaurant I've been to. If you're a fan of Peking duck and sashimi this is the place to go!  The only bad part is the parking. Try to get there before peak hours and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I find it to be OK. I know there are many reviews so I will try not to explain the same things over and over. Lets get to the point... food was OK. I liked the dim sum selections although they were very limited.  Service was good. I expected more after reading all the reviews. I really expected this to be super amazing. The bathrooms are... interesting. I suppose you should go and make your own opinion of this place."}
{"text":"AYCE, fusion Chinese at a price premium.  The ambiance is nice, food quality is not bad, hence the higher price point. People compliant on the print Peking duck... Your only suppose to have the crunchy skin with a bit of meat attached, both the whole duck on your wrap!  The portion of duck meat is so big, I can't even tell if it's BBQ duck out Peking. The selection of sushi and sashimi is disappointing, but then it is a fusion Chinese AYCE not Japanese style AYCE. The delight is watching the making of the Dragon Ball, and noodle. My kids like this place because of the dessert area.  Can't say they are delicacies, but the kids can't tell, they just happy with the selection.  Overall all... You want a clean comfortable AYCE, and willing to pay for it.  This is an OK place."}
{"text":"Probably the best asian buffet you can find in Ontario.  This place is RAMMMED though.  The experience is ruined by how many people there are.  Going to get food feels like I'm walking through the street of Hong Kong during Chinese New Year.  Came here once, won't go back again unless it's on an off-peak time when asian people don't eat at (e.g. 5PM or earlier)"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of items to choose from like King crab legs, hand made noodles, sushi,  robata and peking duck.  The decor was beautiful and modern with lots of different table styles. The only thing I didn't like about this place was the service and location. Our server didn't seem like she knew how to speak English and kept filling our waters non stop. Otherwise I really enjoyed this buffet and would definitely come back.  The price was pretty moderate too."}
{"text":"Took my mom to dinner here for her birthday. As you walk in you get that Asian feel to it right away. The place was pretty busy for a weeknight. Luckily we made reservations.   For me, I find buffet restaurants to be a place where you go and stuff your face with mediocre food to get your money's worth.  So for my first plate I went and grabbed all the different kinds of Chinese food dishes I liked, such as steamed fish, fried chicken wings, dim sum etc. Found the food a little salty. Think they do that to make you drink more water.    I also tried the barbecue garlic oysters. Not great at all!  Which i had to line up for. It had that very fishy taste which tells you its not that fresh! The szechuan beef noodle soup was alright, but in a very small bowl. Another special dish they had there was the peking duck, which was okay. Nothing special. The salmon sashimi was pretty fresh but I had to beg the woman for extra! She didn't seem too happy about me asking for more.  Service was okay. They were very quick to grab your empty plates and pour you more water but when it came to asking them for things like napkins, there lacked the understanding of the English language which was kind of annoying.   All in all in it was a good buffet experience but it's kind of like the Ripley's aquarium! U have to go check it out once but you probably will never go again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday dinner and it wasn't too busy. Peking duck and grilled oysters was the mostly sought for items. A nice selection of sushi and desserts. I found that the sashimi was nice, although tuna, salmon, and butterfish were the only ones available. However, the grilled items were on the unpopular side which caused them to get cold. Some other notable items included the savoury herbal soup, fresh noodle soup, tofu pudding, cheesecake, and ice cream."}
{"text":"This update review of Dragon Legend is based on my Saturday Dinner Buffet ($29.99) experience.  I am never a fan of AYCE or Buffet so this review can be a little bias. But I was honoured to be invited to a special dinner for my Godson's First Month Birthday Celebration and I have a good time eating with my friends.  I doubt I would be back again in a rush....  The sushi, maki and sashimi offering is quite impressive for a buffet restaurant: hamachi salmon, butterfish and scallops were both really good. The rolls and sushi were not bad. Enough selection compare to others I had been to.  In general, the cooked food were average. I would stay away from everything that were deep fried in a batter. As they were all heavily coated and drip in oil. Peking Duck, Dim Sum, Various Stir Fried items were not bad. I enjoyed my little bowl of hand shaved noodle as it was cooked al dente with a choice of broth (spicy beef please!)  Dessert table has various selection of cakes, pastries, pudding. Good on varieties as I tried a few but did not really enjoy anything.....  Since we were in a semi private area at the back of the restaurant, we were only allowed to stay or 2 hour (from 5 pm-7 pm), and right 7 pm, we were presented with the bill... Just make sure you tell your group not to be late!  Dragon Legend is good place for a gathering with friends and families. But I doubt, I would be back just because of the food.....  Sadly, they no longer offers a la carte dim sum for lunch anymore as of April 21."}
{"text":"This new Chinese buffet isn't exactly worth going to. The Mandarin Buffet just down the road is by far better tasting and better quality. The food was served  somewhat hot and slowly refilled. The ambience was cozy and traditional. Service was sub-par. The table was given 2.5 hours to enjoy the buffet; however, we were given a \"last call\" at the 2 hour mark. I'm not one to normally complain, and I understand that the restaurant was busy, but after being told we only had half an hour left I lost my appetite for dessert. All in all this place was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This place is great. My family has been coming here for around 2 years now. It is pretty pricey so its only on occasion, well I guess you are paying for how fancy the place is. The food quality is pretty good, way better than Mandarian. I personaly love the peaking duck, and the steak you have to ask to be cooked! The funny thing about this place is that there are quite a lot of \"China men\" being Chinese myself, but I guess it may be the location, who knows haha.. Overall this place is worth trying, the variety of asian food is awesome, from appetizers, to sides, to mains, and desserts Edit: Its a classier, more authentic, not as disgusting, Mandarian"}
{"text":"The latest spot for Chinese buffet. Although I am not a big fan of buffet-too hard not to over eat - most of the time with mediocre food. But I have to say I really like the foods here. Everything is fresh and tasty. Abundance of seafood like king crab legs, shrimps, mussels. Also generous size of salmon, yellow tail, butter fish sashimi and sushi's. Fresh Peking ducks. Well prepared meats and vegetables. A yummy grilled section. Desserts selection is great and even had me trying some, as I usually skipped desserts for good food. Definitely recommend and will go back."}
{"text":"About: I have been to Dragon Legend four times since they first opened, and it has surpassed the other places to become my favorite buffet. As many people probably know; Dragon Legend is the sister restaurant to the equally popular Pearl Dragon. They even share the same interior decor with red walls, and decorated with Chinese ornaments, and television screens hung on the walls. Its spacious dining area allows the customers to have a more enjoyable dining experience and not have to maneuver in cramped spaces.  Food: The buffet selection at Dragon Legend is abundant enough without overcompensating quantity over quality. Their buffet options showcases an array selection of both Western and Asian dishes. Additionally, they also have a sushi/sashimi station, Teppanyaki grill station, Peking Duck, and an impressive dessert station. There is a good amount of choices for the average diner, and should be something for everyone if you like buffets.  One of the main reasons why I love Dragon Legend; they offer Peking Duck. The staff would place the cooked duck onto a platter, and everything is self-served. Just note that on extremely busy days; they do limit each customer to four pancakes containing Peking Duck on each visit to the station. I saw a girl on a moderate night (around 8:30 pm) taking 10 pieces and they didn't say anything, so it really depends on the nights. The crispy texture of the skin was absolutely divine with the sauce.  Price: The weekend price may be slightly steep at $29.99 for Friday-Sunday dinners, but I thought it was pretty worth it. The quality of the food was rather good for a buffet, and could justify for the cost (for example, you could load up on Peking duck). The price for their Monday to Thursday is comparable to other nearby buffets at $24.99 per adult. I dined here on four occasions (and on different days); Monday, Thursday and two Saturdays. I was surprised to find that no matter what days I went; it was completely busy around the late dinner time (7:00 pm'ish. I haven't tried out their lunch buffet yet but the prices are as followed: M-F ($13.99) and Sat-Sun ($19.99).  Service: On all visits; I thought that the service was excellent as the staff were attentive, polite, and promptly removed our used dishes. The wait for a table didn't take too long when we had a reservation."}
{"text":"I don't usually like buffets, but this one is a step above others. There's no lobster or crab at dinner, but they more than make up for it by offering peking duck and hand pulled noodle soup. Both were surprisingly excellent.  They also offer salmon and butterfish sashimi at night. Aside from that, they have the standard assortment of Chinese food including dim sum. The inside is pretty decent for a buffet too and the service was very fast."}
{"text":"Tried both the dinner buffet and their dim sum.  Tip: Buy the VIP card $80 one it's worth it ...even if didn't find the food amazing because they are kind of pricey. The $80 vip card will give u 10% off any meal dim sum and their buffets. As well you are given 2 complementary buffets during your birthday month. Hey ...its handy if you're lazy to cook on a weekend and just want to dine out. The $80 already makes up for 2 people so your VIP card technically would be considered free.  Food wise ...I thought the noodle to order was pretty delicious ..but how many bowls of noodles could you possibly eat during a dinner buffet? The complementary shrimp sashimi were pretty fresh and sweet. The selection was alright it kind of just reminded me of an upscale buffet with nicer décor."}
{"text":"I think I just ate my weight in pounds of food. . .  Anyways, on with the review!  Coming here at 8pm, we were circling the parking lot (fairly small) for a spot and luckily snatched one at the front.   When entering this restaurant, the decor is really jaw dropping. So many decors of all sort to make it look like you're really in China! There are even movies playing on a giant projector in the food islands area!  As you wait for a table, you are given a vibrating beeper. At that moment, I took the opportunity to walk around and admire the decor.  As we were seated at our table, the ooh's and ahh's kept coming through my mind.  The washroom itself is really practical where there's a main area for mirrors and sinks and then it branches off into male/female washrooms.   GETTING to the food part, I give it a 3/5 overall. Other than the crême brûlée that I've loaded on from the vast dessert section, I really enjoyed the noodle bar as I got to witness the staff handslicing the noodles before cooking it right in front of you. It's quite an art!  I was so bummed out that everyone but me seemed to have a 15% off coupon they had received in the mail! I paid 24.99 for adult dinner.   During the day, this restaurant is a dim sum / sushi joint and at night it's a buffet. This is a good place for a date or family and group gatherings."}
{"text":"Sushi and dim sum at the same time? Yes please!  Dragon Legend is pretty awesome. It's probably one of the largest AYCE restaurants that I've ever been to. Of all the selections, I really enjoyed the butterfish, which had a smokey flavor to it. The salmon and tuna sashimi is heavily guarded by a person who ensures that you don't take more than 2-3 of each at a time. I also tried the steak cubes (made to order), the peking duck, and the hand-made noodle soup. It was all delicious.  The interior is pretty swank. Definitely well decorated. The service is pretty good as well. The biggest disappointment was the lack of parking. I parked across the street at Costco. Would I come back? Very likely."}
{"text":"In trying to satisfy a picky group of family members, I ended up booking us a table at Dragon Legend.  I was a little wary, as my experience with buffets had previously included wearing your roomiest pair of pants gorging on a large amount of mediocre food. I was surprised to find out the Dragon Legend had a great variety of well made food.  The knife cut noodles (dragon noodles) were SO GOOD and there was even a robot behind the counter?  Their Peking duck and their sushi were very fresh.  And I also liked that the plates were nice and small, probably an effort to reduce waste (/waist?).  All in all, a great buffet that has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This is decent Chinese buffets; there are not too many left in the GTA. It does get super busy and crowded on weekends. Food quality is decent and they are fairly quick with replenishing the food.  Feature peking duck with dinner buffet. There a good selections of food."}
{"text":"I was neither impressed or unimpressed with this buffet.  1st, i came on a Saturday night and this place is Jammed pack for dinner service.  overall i found the food all tasted quite delicious... quality is good.  Not your typical manchu wok items.  Here is some pros and Cons  Pro: Quality of food ambiance and decoration dessert section is not too shabby (black sesame ice cream)  Cons: -Line ups! the place is not strategically laid out.  People may butt you in line and those wanting a simple tempura shrimp may fine themselves in the peking duck line waiting for 6-8 minutes.  -a lady stands by the \"good stuff\" limiting you. salmon sashimi and scallops... 2 tiny piece of scallops per turn. 3 pieces of big sashimi cuts.  -selection is small for the buffet section.  and for the price?  i expected more.  -Price of 30 dollars a person is pretty steep considering the amount of selection they have is not as big as spoonful or even the old star walk.  The seating section is very large and spacious.. but the actual buffet section is pretty tiny compared to the space they have.   I think if spoonful moves into markham.  they would take over if people are really willing to spend this amount of money for a small buffet.  (also, no more hot crab legs. only cold super salty ones)"}
{"text":"I came here for their Tuesday lunch special at 1pm . The lunch hour is from 11:30am to 3pm.  The place was packed. There were a few on the waiting list before us. They were well staffed and the service was good. The refill for the buffet food were very well kept too. The decor is beautiful and always makes me feel like I'm dinning at Asian Alice Wonderland."}
{"text":"This is definitely worth trying.  As Chinese buffet restaurant, they definitely serve high quality food and tons of varieties like cook to order noodle soup ( the noodle are home made and cut by a robot), dim sum, sushi, lot of veg dishes, Korean bar, grill section, ice cream bar, sweet tofu soup, desert bar......  my family went at lunch time during the week so sashimi, raw bar and perking duck aren't included but still a great varieties of food.    Some of the reviews said it is pricy however compare to the Chinese buffet restaurants back in Boston, I think it is reasonable especially for the quality.  The place is clean and servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"Dragon Legend is definitely as big and cool as it sounds and fit for dragons. I've been here numerous times now and I really enjoy this place. One of the biggest highlights is the decor with sick details. This place is massive and there are so many rooms that all have high quality heavy wood furniture and awesome pieces such as boats you could eat on. The layout is similar to Mandarin's where the buffet area is in the middle and the rooms are joined to it. It is simple to navigate.  The food is definitely better than other Chinese buffets. It tastes more authentic, and while it is not the best every time, the peking duck, fried chicken, and the fresh noodles are one of my highlights here. They also have a sushi bar, a grill area, large variety of desserts, soups, and quite a large amount of staples in the Chinese cuisine. Every time I come, I am STUFFED. Service is also quite good, they clear the dishes and fill any beverages in a timely manner. Did I also mention FREE WIFI?!  My only negatives are that the parking is hoorrrrible when it's busy. Many times we'd have to park on the street on the outskirts of the place. Sometimes the quality is hit or miss where certain items would be good one day and another not as fresh.  4/5. Dragon Legend is great for renting out as well for events (we hosted a Moon Yute here!). The food variety is great, and it's definitely a place I would take my relatives or if I'm trying to impress someone. ;)"}
{"text":"Food was good, variety of food was great. A bit pricey for a weekday dinner. However, really enjoyed the Peking duck, would have loved to see more seafood choices during weekday dinner since it is over $30/person after tax and tip not including drinks. Great for groups. Will come back to do a weekend dinner but that price tag is close to $45/person. And children 1 and up they charge $2.99 which is kind of ridiculous. Other places children 2 and under are free."}
{"text":"Came here for the dinner buffet on Friday. I booked a reservation for 10 people and they seated us quickly. The table size was very good. The overall layout of the restaurant is comparable to a Mandarin restaurant with the buffet at the centre and rooms spread all around.  I would strongly recommend coming here early (before 7:15pm) on busy nights because there is a limited number of parking spaces and you might have to park on the side of the road which may be an annoyance to people who can't parallel park :).  Some of the food was disappointing, but I did not expect too much after hearing comments from friends who came before.   The sashimi in particular was very bad. The salmon lacked any semblance of salmon flavour and was clearly not fresh. The tuna was slightly better but still below average quality. For a buffet, they had quite a variety of sushi rolls to choose from. They were much better quality than the sashimi.  I have to congratulate them for having the best peking duck I've ever tasted at a buffet, which made up for the sashimi. Perhaps they got lucky with duck being so juicy.  The noodle soup bar was pretty good. You can choose your own soup base and meat. It's hard to find the kind of noodle they used so I would recommend giving it a try.  There were a good number of meat and Chinese side dishes that were of typical buffet quality. The dim sum was good but I personally don't find much value to eat dim sum for a dinner buffet price.  I didn't try any of the salad bar items including crab legs.  The soup choices consisted of sweet & sour, wonton and pumpkin shark fin.  The dessert had the most variety.  I tried the taro tapioca dessert and it was a little too watery but it suited my taste. The fruit was average in terms of freshness and the ice cream was average as well.  The service was not terrible but it wasn't great either because they lacked staff to pick up dirty dishes. It wasn't so bad that we had to call them over to pick them up because they filled the table but it did take awhile for them to come.  It's nice to see a restaurant try so hard on the decor. While I wasn't super impressed, it did give a different atmosphere compared to your typical buffet.  For $30.00 per adult for Fri/Sat/Sun dinner buffet, it is on the pricey side. I wouldn't say you're missing out on too much if you don't try this place out. However, I would come here again for special occasions if a friend wanted to give them a try."}
{"text":"Second time coming, this time with a very large group for a company dinner. Had 2-3 servers for 30+ guests which seemed a bit lacking. Was hard to wave one down to order drinks after the first round.  The food was really good and there's a big selection of Chinese dishes, Japanese sushi and sashimi, saw a random pizza. The restaurant was very clean and the food was organized. There were oysters on Friday, at the beginning they were serving small ones and later they had bigger fat ones. The more expensive food they would limit 2-3 servings per customer which the servers would put on the plate. The noodle bar serves handmade noodles, see someone pulling the noodles into the boiling pot. Never saw an empty platter so the refill speed was quite good.  Overall, a good all you can eat place and will probably come back in the future."}
{"text":"This place has everything: - all-you-can-eat oysters OR crab legs (depending on the night) - sashimi, sushi, squid sushi!! And they're thick-cut sashimi - tom yum soup, sweet papaya soup - fried mackerel fish, fried cod - french fries, fried chicken wings - dim sum (shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings) - fried rice, fried noodles - mainly Chinese dishes (stir fry vegetables, stir fry chicken/beef/seafood)  This restaurant is gigantic, but the food area is pretty small. I don't like crowds, and I really hate Markham crowds. I also hate Markham parking lots... so you get of all the above here. No I didn't calculate this into my 4/5 rating. I'm just giving you a warning!!  The food is great, but nothing to run home about. Service was alright. I'd recommend reservations! (which I got!!)  My table was very close to the buffet, but there are tables that are INSANELY FAR. WOW. What a walk.  All-you-can-eat oysters = really bad, not-at-all fresh oysters  My glass of hot water is SO tiny. They're not coming fast enough to fill my water even though the restaurant wasn't busy that night.  Total was $32 for dinner + $5 \"special\" drink (I had the warm black sesame milk tea, that was delicious! Their drinks remind me of Green Grotto's. The size of these drinks is a Large) / per person + tax and tip = $95 for two people!!   I chose this restaurant because I couldn't decide what to eat, and at the time I was craving everything (sushi, dim sum, I also want soup and ice-cream). Thanks to Dragon Legend, I had everything I wanted!! But then I also know specific restaurants that make fantastic dim sum, another that does authentic soups and Chinese dishes, another that has amazing sushi... so Dragon Legend's food obviously doesn't compare to the specialty restaurants, but it was \"good enough\" for the night (when I wanted everything without visiting 3+ places).  The price however is suuuuper steep."}
{"text":"There weren't too many selective choices.  They said unlimited fresh oysters but were only limited two at a time , by the time your on your 4th plate you would be already full  because you wouldn't just be getting oysters .  What pissed me off was right away we were told there is a time limit of 2 hours . But it's not the point. While we were eating about an hour and 20 minutes in, the waiter came to our table with hot napkins saying it's our last call. Wtf is that nonsense . I talked to the manager Peter and his response was sorry . The room was booked and there were lots of people waiting outside because they came early . That's your problem and theirs for coming early.  We had the table reserved we came on time and are paying customers.  We deserve to eat in a timely manner . Not rush us out ."}
