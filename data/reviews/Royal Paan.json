{"text":"Place serves good chaat type food. Would have given it five stars if the servers knew not to bring the dessert before the food. Perhaps best you inform your server to bring food out so everyone on the table can eat together and dessert co.es after everyone has finished their meal."}
{"text":"Worst place, roaches everywhere. The floor is so dirty that you can tell from outside of the store that it hasn't been cleaned in years. They have all the expired candies and food items, rude staff. No manners for customers. Please be careful with your payments as they tend to over charge on your bill. DO NOT EAT any food there, unless you wanna get sick and get food poisoning. The employees pick their noses and use those filthy hands to prep a Paan for the customers. Their milk which was used in a falooda also tasted sour I think they don't keep fresh dairy either. This franchise has gone to Shits. You want to eat authentic Paan go visit the original Paan house in the heart of Toronto called Baldev Paan. Or even better milan Paan and ice cream in Mississauga where you can get fresh and good food as well."}
{"text":"Not really a place to have dinner though, if your looking for some snacks, then it's alright. Menu includes masala fries, gol gappay, masala soda, kulfi,falooda's, and a wide range of masala dosas to pick from.

I love the ambience of this place. It's a stylish place for sure, but after that that fades away and you realise the scenario about the customer service, very very weak, and the managing is even worse. I don't think there is a Manager here?? There are many workers working there often, yes, but I never seen any interaction with the customers. I also noticed few times, other customers asking the workers questions, seemed like they were or have not been trained. Everyone one is on their own vibe, but not representing Royal Paan's brand. I find this place has so much potential though. They have a different kind of vibe, but the menu needs to be improved, and workers need to start representing Royal Paan. The shirts say they work there, but this needs to confirmed through their actions at work. Sometimes I see too many workers on shift. 4-8 employees (including the cooks) and they are just standing by and looks like the workers are unsure what to do? 

I remember the time I ordered Gol Goppay, I never ever ordered that again. Why? Honestly to me it tasted EXACTLY the same as those Gol Goppay dhabas you get from Fruiticana or Apna Punjab...same taste and everything. No difference and trust me I have tried Gol Goppay everywhere. I know the difference between gol goppays  especially when you freshly make it yourself..you can catch the difference instantly. If you gave me 10 different gol goppa dishes from 10 different restaurants, I could even tell you which restaurant it came from. I wasn't impressed about that....Tell you that much..

3/5 for this place right now. I remember the time they just opened, and I was snooping from outside the window, wondering when you would open. I thought from standing outside was that this is going to be one great restaurant. 

If I see improvements I will be back to bump it up :)"}
{"text":"My favorite new spot for Authentic East Indian street food. A great variety of frozen drinks and desserts. Their Paan was delicious and better than anywhere else I have had before.
Mysore Masala Dosa and Dahi Kachori Puri were awesome and Soooooo Tastyyyyyy. I am definately coming back."}
{"text":"Came here after my family was in the mood for chaat. Royal Paan has a ton of menu options, and their masala fries are amazing! The chaat and dosa are decent, you can find much more authentic places in Calgary. 

The falooda and lassi were really good though, however extremely filling. They also have a wide variety of paan, (hence the name). Staff was very friendly, and I will be coming more often since they opened a new location in the South!"}
{"text":"What an absolute mess inside and outside.  No care about the customer and their needs.  The outside is so littered it reminds one of a slum.  Take care of the inside and outside and perhaps you'll gain more business.  Clean up your act!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  I would eat here again to continue trying something different and learning about this food.  This place has the potential to be a 4 star for me however, here is some improvements that I think could happen to get it there.  The food is pretty unique and tasty and I wanted to try this place because someone told me great things.  I told the server it was my first time and I would appreciate some help selecting.  I also mentioned I wasn't doing too spicy today.  Their advice was pretty soft spoken.  The menu wasn't super detailed.  I think if there were pictures in it would have been helpful.  The East Indian community probably thinks highly of this restaurant because it is certainly trendy, but if you want to attract more foodies or Canadian folk it would be helpful to be a lot more inviting and offer suggestions.  I didn't see much of my server, they didn't check in with me much.  It would have been helpful if they did so I could have gotten some water on a regular basis.  Lastly the shakes and chai tea are both amazingly tasty.  I did find the drinks are what set my bill over the top.  They are incredibly pricey for what they are and the size is disappointing.  For $5 I could get a big Frappuccino or a bubble tea.  They are special and delicious but really expensive.  So could be better in my books with customer service and value for money, but the food is tasty and worth trying."}
{"text":"Came across this place when looking for Kashmiri chai in Calgary. However, their Kashmiri chai wasn't up to the mark but their falooda was amazing. Will def be back to check more of their menu offerings"}
{"text":"Awesome service in and out in 30 mins food was ready in 8 mins very good for fast food we loved it food was delicious love to go again and again girl served us her name is Rajani very polite and nice girl for service thank you so much Rajani."}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere, known for Indian street food and snacks, a great selection of Dosas. This place has always satisfied me and my guests, they are good at what they do. I always get a Indian chai with my food, and also order pani puri which are Crisp round pastry looking things which are stuffed with potato and spice filling and served with a spiced water to dip or drink after you eat it. My favorites I could eat hundreds. Do try."}
{"text":"messed up our order mot only once but twice we had to pay for the unrecieved samosa chat to"}
{"text":"my first time in this resturant...nice concept..we tried falooda...masala chai...and mango lassi...all were authentic...would have given 4 stars if the service was better...it needs to be more organized...especially regarding seating the guests in a proper and timely manner...will go back some day to try their street food items...."}
{"text":"We went twice on a weekday evening and only experienced great service on both visits. The food was made fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting my sister in Calgary and she suggested I try out their falooda. So i went ahead and ordered the dahi sev puri and their royal falooda and both were amazing!! A must try!"}
{"text":"If you have never had access to the immensely pleasurable act of sucking down on a delicious drink falooda, this is your gateway to that parallel universe. What amazing faloodas these guys make and if you love paan, you will go crazy inside this place. Ah, the good life. Have a paan, suck on that fatty goodness called falooda and rent a bollywood movie on your way back home. Oh yes they have movie rentals."}
{"text":"Been here several times, the food is good though the service is horrible. I do not mind waiting to be seated though people who came after us were seated before as they seemed to know the staff. Also, the teas were quite bad as explanation the sales staff said it was made in the morning."}
{"text":"Best authentic Indian street food I have ever tasted in Calgary. The restaurant is not like any other restaurant you would go to in NE for \"real\" taste of India. It's just a month old, great interiors, very clean and organised. They take orders on iPad ( fancy) and customer service is really good. They checked in on us every time they found us waiting for food and followed up as well. We ordered 5 items : pani Puri , dahi kachori Puri, sev batata Puri, vada pav and Bombay chutney. Food was very fresh and you could taste the custom made spices in there. It took them while to serve us but because food was so fresh and good , we didn't mind. They have a \"paan\" bar. It's a Betel-nut leaf filled with mouth freshners of different kinds. Paan was fresh and good in taste. We will definitely recommend this to all Indian food lovers and this place might be our next go to restaurant."}
