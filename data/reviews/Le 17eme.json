{"text":"Pros: nice terrace on the pedestrian street Rue Prince Arthur, friendly staff, two for one beers during happy hour, delicious seafood bisque.

Cons: Shrimp in my pasta dish tasted like they were from frozen, dessert that came with our table d'hote was an extremely dry yellow cake that tasted like it had been in their fridge for weeks, the wait staff's ability to speak English was extremely limited"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant has two names.  The sign outside says Le 17eme, yet inside I saw the name Restaurant Minerva.  The receipt said Le 17eme, so I'm putting this review under the name on the window and receipt.

I had the Le carr√© d'agneau or rack of lamb.  It was a good cut of meat, with a nice sauce some nice vegetables and I believe a potato puff."}
{"text":"Closed. The food must have been great.... no... couldn't have been... they are CLOSED! That's French for \"the food sucked!\""}
