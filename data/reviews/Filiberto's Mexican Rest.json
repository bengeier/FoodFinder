{"text":"Damn you perfectly delicious, mouthwatering wallet friendly chile relleno burro. I can never have enough of you!! Service is definitely friendlier & quicker at this location then the one off of 16th St/ McDowell."}
{"text":"This place was terrible!!! They took over 15 minutes to get the food.. We ended up leaving after paying without the food because they weren't wearing gloves and kept touching lifting up their pants! I will never eat at this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant chain is.. Decent. My bf and I have visited this location a couple times when we are craving mexican food and can't find anything else.   The beef tacos are pretty darn good but everything else is just ok. Beans and rice are very.... Bland just like their customer service. Now that I have discovered los taquitos on 48th and elliot featured on Diners,Drive-ins,and Dives. Boy is their carne asada worth the trip and gas. No more mediocre mexican cuisine!"}
{"text":"Filiberto's is a average fast food restaurant in phoenix. They do have good price on taco Tuesday. I would more then like choose them over your typical fast food mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Woke up so hungry this morning that I thought I would start biting my right hand. Didn't want McDonald's, BK, Jack... I wanted a true Mexican breakfast burrito.  Once I have a foodie vision in my head, I'm locked in and make it an unwavering attempt to meet my goal.  I order the Sausage/Egg/Cheese Burrito. Excited, I hand the Cashier (drive-thru) my debit card. He disappears for what seems like a prolonged time to just swipe my card. I don't mean to be paranoid, but being a past victim of someone stealing my bank info and going crazy in Montreal, CAN, made me this way. He comes back w/ear-to-ear grin. I'm suspicious as how can someone be THAT giddy so early? Maybe he just is. Happy pills? Chronic? I dunno... I think I just think too much.  Back to the food - I race to my place of work and am DYING to bust the seam on my burrito log. Honestly, the sausage crumbles tasted old and a little dry. Cheese grease was seeping everywhere. On a positive note, love their red (spicy) sauce and the verde (tomatillo) sauce. My tummy is pissed and it feels like WW3 going on inside. I'm throwing the rest away.   May return but for lunch or dinner fare. May not."}
{"text":"OMG!  Late night snack and we were in the area...I tried the shrimp, fish, rice, cabbage and ranch HUGE burrito, IT WAS AMAZING!!!  And only $4.99!  I added lime and green salsa, it was so good!!!"}
{"text":"I usually go there . Everything its good  exept when u buy  alot of stuff  they never give good enough sauce  2  at least per person"}
