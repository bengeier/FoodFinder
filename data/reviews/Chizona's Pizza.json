{"text":"This was my first experience ordering their pizza. Our salon does business with them a lot. This place was recommended by some of our stylists because of the taste, definitely not the service. This was by far the most appalling customer service I've ever experienced. After being charged incorrectly, I called on the delivery order that had just come. Upon letting Deb know that my order had just come and I had been charged wrong, she started to argue with me trying to tell me that my order was a medium, and not a small, although I had the pizza sitting in front of me. Once realizing her error she rudely told me it was a mistake and I'd be charged correctly. I was appalled that there was no apology or anything, on top of her being incredibly rude to me. I tried to call back to speak to a manager about the customer service, and Deb answered once again, saying there was no manager, that her cousin was the owner. She continued to deny that she was rude and stated that if we didn't like her customer service, that we shouldn't order from her. The most unprofessional person I have ever spoken to and by far the worst customer service! I wasn't even able to enjoy my pizza because I was so upset."}
{"text":"Don't expect anyone to \"roll out the red carpet\" or provide exceptional service.  Fast food joint that's really slow, but worth the wait.  Italian Beef and Chicago sports memorabilia, makes you feel like you're in The Windy City.  Jardineria was on point."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. I've ordered from them four times total. Three of those for delivery and one pick up. The delivery took over an hour on all three deliveries and I literally live half a mile away from them. The three pizzas I had delivered were all cold, dry, and overdone. The one pizza I went to pick up was OK, but still lacking in taste and was overdone. The restaurant (if you can call it that) itself is quite dirty, and even though I ordered ahead of time I still waited 20 minutes in the store for the pizza to be finished. I will never order or eat here again and would advise everyone to do the same."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Hot dogs too! They deliver or you can dine in. Great Chicago atmosphere. It's a must!"}
{"text":"Wow...just standing here waiting for a slice and the front girl has touched her crotch, her eyes and her nose.  She is sniffing like she is coming down with a cold.  I am afraid to eat the pizza but I have been here before and the pizza is good.  At least she has not touched any food that I have seen so far.  Whoever the owner is should make sure the workers understand hygiene.  The female driver has just ran her fingers through her hair 3 times!  Not a huge deal since she is not working with the food but still.  I am getting my slice now and it's pretty bland but huge piece.
The owner needs to make sure that the staff is properly trained and have attended food handler classes."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and 2 sandwiches off the menu for pick up. Off the charts good. The next time we are in the Scottsdale area we will be hitting this place up again."}
{"text":"If you are from Chicago and enjoy a thin crust square cut Chicago Style pizza then you're going to love Chizona's (Chicago + Arizona ; get it?). We travel from the Palm Springs California area almost monthly for medical care at Mayo Clinic in both the Phoenix Clinic and Specialty Building and the Mayo Medical building in Scottsdale off Shea Blvd. 
Look up our enjoyable review of the Days Inn & Suites at 7330 Noth Pima Road. On our last stay a month ago we picked up the hotel local restaurant list and noticed Chizona's Pizza. They deliver to the room. 

I grew up in Chicago and relocated to California in 1979. It seems that the best in Chicago Pizza, Hot Dogs, Ribs and most North Suburban fast food relocated to Arizona and, with the exception of a few out of the way Chicago Style restaurants there is little to offer West of Phoenix or Tucson. Imagine my surprise to find a rare thin crust pizza cut into squares from Chizonas. My wife offered pasta and we split a salad and an order of garlic cheese bread. This was the best Pizza I had West of Chicago. Sure, I love Louis Magnetic, Gino's East, Rosatis (when they were still owned by the Chicago Family but California Rosatis chain has much to be desired. 
I love luck crust Pizza but at 66 years old it no longer loves me. 
To give you some idea of comparison, there was a similar thin crust Pizza on Milwaukee southeast of Devon called Father & Sons. It you remember this one and enjoyed it then you will love Chizona's. La Rosa on Dempster Street in Skokie also had a great thin and thick Crust Pizza. Going back to 1970; if you went to college at the U of I in Urbana you might remember the Fraternity run Sicilia Pizza Poppa Del's. These were some of the best days for Pizza Lovers. 

Give Chizona's a try and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. 

As a bonus - look for my review of another Chicago Restraint you'll love, Portillos. Vienna Hot Dogs, Poppy's end buns, Charburgers, Italian Beef & Sausage and more. True Chicago in Scottsdale on 90th and Shea Blvd."}
{"text":"The women answering the phones at this establishment should be fired. The worst customer service I've experienced and I'm glad It was over the phone because it was that bad. I've tried patronizing this establishment twice in the last week with no luck.. Very disappointing and sad and I hope other families in the area have had a better experiance than mine."}
{"text":"Just had pepperoni and sausage pizza delivered. Crust is thin and crispy and perfect. Sauce has an excellent spice to it. It was absolutely delicious! Also got the antipasto salad and garlic bread with marinara. Would definitely have it again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. Swung in recently while in town for the Patriots Superbowl and my table got three fantastic sub's, great fries, pizza and salads, all were delicious. Wish I could be a return customer but am shipping off back to Boston tomorrow. Go Patriots! Five star pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and some of the best wings I've ever had. Very friendly owners and staff make you feel welcome. Definitely not a fancy joint, but prices are very good for the portions you get... however,  they lose a star for lack of parking. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Chicago dog first time here and it was splendid! I will be back to check out the pizza. Love the hole in the wall ma and pa places! No a/c but then Chicago was built on sweat!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I have lived about a mile away from this place for 20 years and this was my first visit. It will not be my last!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great greasy, hole in the wall, grill/burger joint in Scottsdale. They also make some good pizza. Prices are more than fair and you definitely get alot for your money."}
{"text":"Thin crust here truly reminds me of thin Chicago pizza.  Friendly service too, and I love the RC cola on tap.  The afternoon slice is a big portion size.  Fries are delicious, and a generous portion for the price too.  Like this little shop."}
{"text":"We won't be back.  We are native Chicagoans and Aurelio's this is not! The sauce is good, the toppings are good but sparse and not enough cheese. But the biggest problem with this pizza is the thin crust, which was so touch we could hardly chew it. So disappointed.  Drove the length of Scottsdale to get it and could hardly eat it."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! It's right by boyfriend's house and all the other pizza places around him haven't been that great. But this is one pizza parlor we will definitely be coming back to.

We stopped in this past Friday night and ordered pizza to go. We got pepperoni and pineapple and were quite happy with it. I would like it a little crispier, but I'm sure if I ask for that, it wouldn't be problem.

They're very friendly here. It's a tiny tiny place so don't expect much when you go. After reading some of the reviews on here, it seems I should try their Pizza Puffs and hot dogs. That's next!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but a bit salty. Delivery was very fast, even on the weekend."}
{"text":"Won't order from here again because the food was horrible. We had three items from Chizona and only the Gyro was edible. The pizza tasted like a cheap frozen pizza but the toppings weren't nearly as fresh. The sampler platter was a soggy mess of onion rings and mozz sticks so over fried the cheese has melted out of them. The bag of chips had even expired - come on you really need to pay more attention to quality. It really shows a lack of respect for your customers when you send garbage like this out."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from them via GrubHub, a small pizza and fried zucchini. As usual, my eyes were bigger than my stomach! The food was excellent* and the delivery driver was a gem. He asks me \"Your first time ordering with us?\" I nodded while signing the receipt and with a big smile he said \"You're gonna like it.\" I dig confidence, so I had a laugh. And once I opened up the food, well it spoke for itself. You can tell that food has been made with love and honor to a recipe by looking at it. This food, yeah. I liked it. A lot. Bravo, ChiZona!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza. Best Frys and roat beer u can get. You must try. Very Quint and family oriented. Little slices make it easy to eat too."}
{"text":"I have been using Yelp for over a year and never wrote a review. I had to after trying Chizona Pizza. I live nearby so was always curious. My wife and I ordered a sub and a pizza. They delivered it and when I unwrapped it I noticed they gave me the wrong sub. I called to let them know, they argued saying I ordered something different. I was very specific when I ordered the first time and the guy even repeated it on the phone at the end of the order, so it was very clear they just dropped the ball. He never apologized once and asked me to drive there to pick up a new one if I really wanted it. I just told him to refund me on my card instead, as he sounded pretty pissed and I wasn't about to risk having a very angry guy remake me the sub I actually ordered. I was pretty bummed about the experience as I was excited to finally order from there. Oh and by the way, we could barely eat the  pizza...it was very below mediocre. Most frozen pizzas are better. :( We should have never strayed from Barros.
.....quick update (months later)...they actually didnt refund the cost of the sub, instead they recharged me just for the pizza. So I paid for 2 pizzas and a sub and really received 1 pizza and the wrong sub. I had to go into the restaurant on a specific day to talk to the right manager to get it straighten out. I also had to provide my bank account transaction history to show it...this is a true story, and it is almost hillarious by the end of it all. Lordy."}
{"text":"Chizona's is awesome. The atmosphere is great, the staff was really friendly and helpful the first time we went in, not to mention the pizza is a delicious traditional Chicago style, which is hard to find around here. I have yet to try the chicago beef, but it's next on the list. Fantastic spot."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings to my hotel room. 
Food was authentic Chicago and delivery guy was very nice. Will order again!"}
{"text":"I never had a problem with the food here, but today I had the most awful customer service while placing an order over the phone. The woman I spoke to was so incredibly rude that I asked for a manager, but of course, I was already speaking to the manager. After telling her that she has the most horrible phone manners I've ever heard, I cancelled my order and will NEVER spend a dime in that place again!!"}
{"text":"Get past the stupid name for the best pizza since you moved away from Chicago.  No, really.  Seriously, not kidding.  

You've tried Rosati's - hit or miss depending on the location, and AZ locations aren't the same as Chicago suburbs.  Little Chicago is good, but still not home pizza.  We've been frequenting those 2 places for years.  It was what we settled into as 'good' pizza.  I drive past ChiZona 5 days a week.  It's a mile from my house.  And the name is so campy and lame I never ever even bothered to consider trying their pizza.  Boy, I was a dimwit!  Because they offered a Groupon, I decided to check out the Yelp! reviews -- and I was surprised.  So I tentatively ordered a Groupon for ChiZona.  Honestly, I figured if it was garbage, my kids would still eat it.  They don't care.  Ok, to the point -- we ordered a pizza there tonight.  And I was blown away.  Well, with all the pizza I ate, it'll take a lot to blow me anywhere right now...  This is the pizza of my home.  The perfect cracker crust, thin and crispy around the edges, still firm in the middle.  The sauce has the right flavor, man it is SPOT ON.  And they managed to put the exact right amount of cheese for a Chicago pizza.  Perfect.  And it's cooked right, getting those amber brown spots throughout the cheese... Oh my goodness.  I could just kick my own a$$ for not trying this place sooner.  But the name of the restaurant is still dumb..."}
{"text":"Stellar place to go eat. A mom and pop shop with the best taste of Chicago around.
Their beef and sausage sandwitches are flavorful and filling, and they come with fries and a cup of Aus jus.
When it comes to pizza, their thin, flaky crust savors on the tounge like butter. With a generous helping of rich, zesty sauce, and their wide selection of fresh toppings and cheeses, you most likely won't regret anything you order in the menu.
While I haven't had the hot dogs, it looks like the full Chicago experience, complete with green relish, fresh onion, and hot peppers.
From great owners to tasty food, Chizona is a good place to visit, and I daresay, a crime to pass up."}
{"text":"I needed pizza and not big-box pizza.  I wanted a real pizza experience.  I knew Chizona's is where I could get it.

I try to go here for lunch as often as I can.  This last trip, I had the \"Big Slice & Salad\" combo.  The subject slice is a quarter of an entire pizza!  It comes with one topping and I went with the standby, pepperoni.  It's a thinner crust pizza, usually sliced across several times to make a slice so large, manageable to eat.  This last time, I had requested the slice remain uncut.  I wanted to pick up the whole thing and eat it that way.  It's a thinner crust pizza.  As the crust goes out from the center it gets crisper, the edge being near-crackery.  With pepperoni grease dripping & the smell of the oregano I shook on top permeating as I took-bite-after-bite, it was the pizza experience I had been craving.

The salad is a generous mix of romaine, tomatoes, the vegetables associated with pizza and lots of shredded mozzarella.  Delicious.  I had it with their Italian dressing but sometimes I get their Ranch.  It's the mix kind that is 10 times better then the crap in the bottle.

I've had sandwiches, gyros, chicago-style hot dogs and their incredible, fresh-made, fries on past visits and everything has been excellent.

The only thing keeping this from being 5 star is the drink selection.  Now, if you like soda, it's OK.  There is no fountain.  Sodas come in cans (that come w/combos, btw).  I'm not so keen on that.  There's no brewed iced tea and no beer.

Despite my not giving this place 5 stars, Chizona's is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We order from there all the time. Deb in the afternoon is fantastic but the chick at night is terrible. She has a very stupid voice and is too busy smoking to answer the phone. Our food was supposed to be delivered in an hour but it showed up an hour and fifty minutes later stone cold. Something has to be done about your night crew and the nasty girl that answers the phone. She is awful and a definite negative to your business   Too bad because we LIKED your food"}
{"text":"Great Chicago hotdog and very reasonable.   Also had a good dinner salad with tasty grilled chicken on top.  A little dirty on the inside.  Reminded me of being in Chicago."}
{"text":"The pizza and fries are really good! But the front of house woman who takes orders is alway super rude and has a bad attitude in person and on the phone. If your not a people person maybe consider a different job!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst pizza I have ever wasted my money on. The crust may as well have been a saltine cracker. Too thin, too dry no flavor. The cheese wasn't totally cooked in the center slices. And worst of all the pepperoni was under the cheese. Not sure what planet these people learned to make pizza on but it wasn't earth."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place while looking for lunch. Great hole in the wall, everything looked delicious. I had the gyro, not too shabby."}
{"text":"Couldn't order at 9:30 on a Saturday night because their phone mailbox was full. Bummer. Will update if this changes and I try to order again."}
{"text":"This is the best place around for great comfort food! I haven't had anything I didn't love. The wings, pizza and fries are particularly great!"}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I wanted a break from regular pizza take out. He suggested Chizona because he remembered it as having good food.  When the food arrived I could not have been more suprised, and not in a good way. Soggy, borderline tasteless fried zucchini, mozerella sticks that lacked anything but the faintest hint of cheese, mushrooms, and onion  rings that a fast food restaurant would be ashamed of. The pizza was thin crust, square cut, and cold.  They low quality cheese was greasy and unappetizing , but pulling it off and eating that on its own was better than suffering through the entire slice. It may be, based on other reviews, that at one point they were good, but clearly that moment has passed."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my lunch break and got the Vienna Beef Hot Dog lunch special. Basket of fries, hotdog and a drink for 5.95 is a great price.

Fries were hot out the fryer and the hotdog was tasty. Great value for the price will be back again."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza, and cool staff. Got the regular cheese Ny style w crispy crust. Pizza arrived promptly and hot, just enough cheese and not too much sauce. The delivery was quick & inexpensive. 5star all the way!"}
{"text":"Love this place.

Whenever I'm in Scottsdale showing property, or doing a virtual tour for one of my clients I stop by and get the lunch special.

EXCELLENT pizza with loads of cheese."}
{"text":"Recently moved to AZ from Chicago and found this place nearby.  Their attempt at Chicago hot dogs was pretty feeble at best... the dog was soggy (doubting that it was authentic Vienna Beef), they used the wrong pickles... the fries were hard and I couldn't finish them.  The pizza that the guys at the next table over were eating looked pretty sad.  And they're from Chicago and don't make Chicago deep dish pizza?  C'mon...

Dead silent in this place, one tv that was positioned so that nobody could see it, no soda fountain.... I had high hopes, but this place missed the mark.  For good Chicago hot dogs and better ambiance, I'll go to Taste of Chicago on Scottsdale Rd and Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good meatballs... But the actual restaurant is kind of gross.  Its always really hot (no AC?) which means I never want to eat in the building.  Its also got a weird soda situation going on where you can buy overpriced off brand two liters.  But, like I said, the pizza is my favorite in town so I keep going back!"}
{"text":"If you're from Chicago you will appreciate this pizza. Somewhat similar to D'Agostinos and Aurelio's with a sweeter tomato sauce on the thin crust perfectly cut into squares. This restaurant is a smaller hole in the wall type with all Chicago sports memorabilia lining the walls. There is a little outdoor area to eat on a beautiful Arizona day. This place was a great find and I try to eat here a few times a month."}
{"text":"i stumbled into this quaint little place out of starvation, tiredness, and laziness. i didn't expect an incredible food experience. our family has always ordered from chains and nooooo more. the pizza was so fresh and tasty. the salad was so green and crispy.... and the dressing. YUM!! the guys were so friendly and accommodating ... i was thrilled. on our last delivery, we found out the guys make their own ranch in house! way to go fellas! i feel great about supporting these midwestern guys. FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"We love this place and I order when in town for the family. They deliver to our hotel and it's always great! Good pizza, great zucchini and love the antipasto."}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday and have never been inside, so yesterday I was feeling the urge for something new and stopped in.  Many items on the menu looked delicious and the pizza smelled awesome, but that sounded like too much food...I ended up ordering the Italian Sub and the Cheesy French Bread with marinara to-go.  I did not realize the sub came with a side of fresh cut fries, so it ended up being a ton of food, but I was not disappointed!  

The French bread is made in-house and tastes good.  It came with Italian spices sprinkled over the top and the perfect amount of cheese, not to mention perfectly cooked (little crispy along the edge).  The only negative, it was a bit skimpy on the yummy marinara sauce.  

The Italian sub was also tasty, no special meat or anything but delicious nonetheless.  The fresh cut fries were a pleasant surprise considering I didn't realize they came with my order :) 

The service was great and the gentleman at the counter was very helpful and informative.  Chizona's has been around 11 years and has a Midwestern vibe inside.  Lots of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls and the smell of pizza, hot-dogs, and pizza puffs...yum!  I should note for all the Chicagoans that it is NOT deep-dish Chicago style pizza, but it looked good (have not tried it yet).  If you want to deliver, he informed me there is a $10 minimum. Also, they have walk-in specials (i.e.  Vienna beef hot-dog, fries and a drink for $4.99).  I have no doubt, I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I, like other fellow reviewers, have driven by this place and noticed it and always wanted to give it a shot.  Now mind you, I grew up in Chicago, so I'm a tad biased on all things Chicago. So if you are from New York or you are a health nut you shouldn't read any further.  

Now if you are reading this, let me tell you about this amazing place.  First thing you want to do is go to their website and check out their really good deals with the coupons on pizza.  Call them directly, I wouldn't bother with the online delivery service. They have a guy and deliver within 45 minutes.  

So while I had hoped they had deep dish like back home, they offer thin and regular crust.  No matter, I figured I'd give the thin crust a shot..and I was not disappointed.  If you really like thin crust you will love this place. I got a medium with pepperoni and mushroom and it took me back to those hole in the wall places of Chicago growing up as a kid.  Cheesey greasy gooey'ness from heaven that you remember you had at birthday parties and after baseball games.  The kind you have to have lots of napkins nearby kind.  I felt like playing Pac Man while eating it....Awesome!!! 

I am going to go back there and try their hot dogs and beefs.  They look amazing as well."}
{"text":"Good local food location. We had pizza, fries and Ceasar Salad. All of which are good. Must see for Chicago fans."}
{"text":"OK,

Pizza delivered to my hotel.  Check.
Opened up the box and the pie looked delicious. Check.
Pizza had ingredients as requested. Check.
Pizza cut in squares, like a true Chicago pie. Check
Pizza cut all the way through the dough. EPIC FAIL.

My oh my.  When you pick up a slice (Chizona's cuts the pie is squares) you want to pick up a slice with all of the ingredients on top of the slice.  Three of us (two who never had a Chicago style thin crust) and not one slice was cut all the way through.  In a hotel room, with no cutlery we tried our best to keep the ingredients on top of each slice, but pulling apart slices, that are not cut, created an awful mess.  We ended up with a bunch of hand pulled empty slices, and trying our best to put the ingredients on each slice.  We gave up.

If you cant cut a pie, which is so Pizza 101, than you create a crappy experience for your customer.  

3 stars for the fresh ingredients, great sauce, the owner adding some Giardiniera (very fresh and tasty). Minus 2 stars for the mess that was created by the pizza not being cut all the way through.

I had so much higher hope's.

Stay hungry my friends..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, excellent delivery time & if I ever come back again I would definitely go there."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Scottsdale from Chandler and happy to have found Chizona's nearby! Love their pizza and wings! Pizza crust is thin but not too thin with a perfect crisp, sauce is delicious and toppings are always fresh. The wings are good size and meaty with a def kick of heat...perfect for upcoming Super Bowl! Delivery is fast/friendly and Kristen has been wonderful whenever we've called or stopped by to order."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Pizza is sometimes just perfect in flavor and size, other times it is too crunchy and much smaller than the box. 
There calzones are really good, but I get it without ricotta cheese. If I order with pepperoni in it, they put a stack of 15 right in the middle...they dont spread it among the rest of the calzone."}
{"text":"I've got to admit, I was extremely disappointed with their service.  We ordered a pizza and waited for 1.5 hours.  When we finally called to see what exactly was taking them so long, they simply said they couldn't find our location.  I understand there may not be many people with some sort of gps device.  However, after giving them the cross streets and not receiving any sign of misunderstanding from their end, I thought they were good to go.  They said they made a phone call to notify us; when we never received one.  I just hope the charge is reversed like they said they would.  Needless to say, I won't be ordering pizza from them due to their poor customer service."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to dine here with the famous Scott D and his lovely wife. We needed something quick to eat before the Doobie tribute concert and this is where we ended up. Sweet!

Located in a small strip mall and easy to drive right past. This is a nice little hole in the wall restaurant with many of the all time Chicago favorites.

Inside is decorated with all sorts of fun items that make you feel like you are back in the Windy City. You can order at the counter and get it to go or just sit down at one of their cozy tables and take the load off your feet.

Ordered a couple of Chi Dogs and had them dressed to kill. Both my wife and Scott's went with the Chicago Dog special which comes with fries and a drink. Our traveling companion choose the Big Pizza Slice special and it was rather large. My main man Scott went with the Giant Meatball Sandwich and fries. It was HUGE!

Really liked their homemade French Fries and had to grab a few from my wife's basket. The pile was very large and she insisted. Everything tasted really good and the portion sizes were quite large.

Looking forward to trying out their Calzones and more of their other tasty treats in the future. Thanks Mr. Scott for recommending such a swell pick. Going to put this on my top secret rotation when in the area. CUBS WIN THE PENNANT!

4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review on this place for years ever since I went here, but have not taken the time to sit and write a review. I got one of the calzones to go.

It was the gnarliest hunk of who knows what wrapped in tin foil.  It was oozing with cheese and grease from the pepperoni.  I split one of these with my partner and still was disgustingly full by the end of this.

No sooner did I finish this meal that I found myself very sorry in the bathroom with explosions.

I suppose it is evolutionarilyy engrained in you once that happens to safely decide not to eat that food again. So, that's what I have decided to do. If you're looking for a cheap, greasy, filling mess, this is your place."}
{"text":"I moved to Scottsdale a few weeks ago.  I ordered delivery from this place practically every other day for two or so weeks and always tipped.  The cheese dogs, pizza puffs, and salad are all great, but the staff itself doesn't respect you.  One day, the delivery driver was late 30 minutes because of car issues and I completely understood things like that do happen.  When the delivery driver came, I shook his hand, tipped him on the receipt, and walked back inside.  On the phone, I was told my next order was \"on the house\" because my food arrived late; at first I thought \"great!\".  Come the next day, I call somewhere between 11AM and noon and redeem the offer I was given.  My order was identical to the one I made the previous day.  Instead of getting a calzone again (which was unsatisfactory), I asked for hot wings since I have never tried them from Chizonas.  The cashier said they were out of wings.  We then talked about what alternatives there were and decided on chicken fingers.  I was careful to not exceed the dollar amount of my previous order, and the cashier said \"thank you, your order will be there in 30 to 40 minutes\".  The order arrived, but the chicken fingers were missing.  I thought maybe the driver forgot them in the car since there was no delivery receipt for the order, so I quickly called Chizonas and asked them to call the delivery driver since he couldn't have gone too far away.  Another cashier than the one I made the order with picked up the phone this time and looked over my receipt.  She said there were no chicken fingers on the receipt.  Instead of the cashier taking initiative and saying \"we're sending it out now, sorry!\", she asked if I wanted the driver to get them and come back out.  It was quite clear this was intentional by the previous cashier; he didn't want to give me valuable food for free (neither wings or chicken fingers).  I politely answered \"no, thank you\" to the cashier and hung up.  After all that I'd done to make it a good experience for them, this was like being spit on.  As I told the owner in my first few orders, I have been to many, many pizza restaurants and italian eateries.  Things like this separate the average places from the great ones.  I will not eat from here again, ever."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place!!! omg it is the best!! homemade ranch dressing for the pizza, some hot sauce and chizonas and I am the happiest girl in the world! its this lil whole in the wall but the most amazing food ever! good prices and I always come back!"}
{"text":"So my dad, mom and I decided to order pizza tonight from a place other than Hungry Howies or Dominoes. We looked at NYPD, Barro's and Streets of New York until we finally settled on Chizona's since it's a few streets up from my house. We called in and ordered two pizzas, one cheese with feta and the other pepperoni and sausage, hot wings and breaded zucchini. It only took about 45 minutes to get to us and when it arrived it was super fresh and hot. That's always a plus. The pizza smelled divine so we sat down to eat and the first thing we noticed was the crust. Maybe we have been spoiled by all the non authentic pizza we have been ordering over the years, but the crust was slightly flavorless and borderline too crunchy to even eat. The sauce and the toppings were awesome, though, and the breaded zucchini was great! I can't speak on the wings personally but my dad ate a few and commented that they were good. One really big plus was that  nothing was overly greasy and it was probably the freshest pizza I've ever had delivered to me.  All in all I'm not ranting and raving about Chizona's,  but I'm not writing them off either."}
{"text":"My parents love this place. They order here as often as possible. 

I am not a huge fan of their pizza. They only offer thin crust, and their sauce is always a little too acidic for my taste. 

That being said, I absolutely love their salads. I always order salads when my folks want pizza and I can make two meals out of it. The homemade Italian dressing is ahhhhh-mazing. 

I'm excited to try their hot sandwiches next time I'm extra hungry."}
{"text":"I am going to befriend everyone that gave this place 5*'s.. Just so I know where NOT to go! Delivery was quick (thank you sir) but the hot italian beef was immensely, utterly, horribly, disgusting   no au-jus, dry as a old lady in the Arizona sun. Pass on this place. Yuck, excuse me while I hop on the treadmill in grief"}
{"text":"Very unfriendly service. We were still in the middle of our dinner, and it was about 15 minutes before closing and they just turned off the lights and stood at the door. We had to leave with our dinner still in our hands and finish outside on the street!  They couldn't be bothered to wait at least 10 more minutes for a customer to finish their meal. It was really inconsiderate - they were in such a rush to leave; it doesn't seem like they care about their guests or the business.

Btw the pizza was average, nothing special. You can tell that they don't put their hearts into the food - they just go through the motions and look miserable. A VERY weak experience. 

And the place is absolutely filthy and decaying. I felt bad for some of the cool sports memorabilia that was on the wall - torn and stained. gross and sad. After 16 years in business, this place needs a reboot really bad."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty tasty but overly oily and was dripping everywhere. The pizza was a 3 star, the service was a 5 star, so we will even it out and say it was a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"here's a 5 star for chizonas. I had their chicago dog and oh my gosh it was so good!!! the bun, the dog, the toppings, YUM! 

their fries are awesome too. 

and the guy working was so awesome!!! 
someone was having spaghetti and that looked amazing so i will probably have to try it. 

ps- single ladies, if you're lookin for a man come here during lunch. i was the only lady there. it was a man cave."}
{"text":"This is the place! I'm a true Chicagoan.....
My family and myself grew up in the restaurant business and we know food. Please people don't knock us down. Lived here for awhile since 2013.
My mom and myself walked into this establishment and thought hmmm hole in the wall dive.. Right?!?
Well being from Chicago there are a few places like this no joke they are a good thing.
 I couldn't decide what to order. 

I ordered a hot and fries and a medium pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions. The BEST!
The food was delicious! Pizza ingredients (SPOT ON)

Pros: Great food especially the pizza!
Cons: Too many fresh cut fries with your order.

This location is worth the long drive."}
{"text":"Brutes. Toppings and cheese don't stay in pizza and seemed like cafeteria pizza or something a kid made at home."}
{"text":"I've called 22 times today and it either goes to voicemail or just rings and rings and rings. So much for delivery. Y'all are loosing a lot of business more than likely. Get your phone issues or perhaps employee issues taken care of"}
{"text":"There's a reason I live within a few mile radius from here. Any time I miss Chicago, I come here and just chow down. Literally with everything possible on the menu that my little body can take. It is a hole-in-the-wall but that's the beauty. No flash, no bling. Just good people with really good food, together with good sports memorabilia. Walk in and the smells take you to the streets or some sporting event.

A true Chicago hot dog should consist of two things: Vienna Beef and all the fixings. Their Chizona hot dog is the super star and probably their best seller. I forego the fries to order more than 2 ChiZona dogs. Somehow it lessens the guilt, if there should be any. The gyros are another fave. And I have to gush, the calzones are as meaty as the men from there. I will warn the ladies that if you're trying to impress a boy, don't eat here until he's total smitten given you can't have the dogs without onions and the buns require you carry a flosser. Just heads up!

It is so affordable that you could go hog wild and have more than two hot dogs. The only crappy thing is the parking backs up against McDonald which can be a musical chair of sorts to get in and out.  I believe you can have two loves and this place lets me be faithful to Arizona and Chicago."}
{"text":"Great, greasy pizza and excellent salads.  Always ask for dressing on the side."}
{"text":"I really liked this place for delivery...then on a busy night, we went to pick it up.  This place is disgusting.  So dirty!  I have not eaten there since.  What a shame, because I always choose a local place over a chain."}
{"text":"I was cruising through the old neighborhood where I lived during high school and stopped into ChiZona's for the first time, just to see what this new-to-me pizza joint had to offer. Well, once I saw Italian Beef sandwiches on the menu, I had to try one as part of my quest for perfect AZ models. Who could resist a second lunch like this? ChiZona's is among the best in the valley, and I was hooked. On a recent visit from South Tempe, I ordered one w/ sweet bell peppers & hot giardiniera. Upon merely opening the wrapper outside at the table, my olfactory senses were bombarded by the unmistakable, spicy aromas of the perfect Italian Beef! WOW! It all screams authenticity, well before the first bite. There's something that ChiZona's does which is essential, yet absent from so many others. And, it comprised an ample serving of excellent beef & peppers, along w/ first-class giardiniera & extra gravy (that's \"jus\" for us AZ foodies)! I was actually surprised that this sandwich was even tastier than I had remembered, certainly exceeding my hopes for a rare treat. The manager even came out to see how I liked it. Of course, I was culinarily ecstatic! My only complaints/recommendations are (1) set up to dip the whole sandwich to serve it very wet, and (2) don't include a side of fries. There are plenty of carb calories in the Gonnella roll. If I wanted fries, I'd order 'em, and I don't want to pay for fries I'm just gonna' trash. Just charge me less for this exceptional sandwich. So, in the end, it's probably good that I moved away from Granite Reef & McDonald after ASU... otherwise, I'd be walking around the corner every day to satisfy my ChiZona cravings!"}
{"text":"The toppings were high quality and I liked the sauce. The crust was a tad to thin but that's only a personal preference."}
{"text":"We love this place. Thin crust Chicago pizza. Italian beef. Just like home. Hand cut fries. Just like home. Owners were awesome. Wish I didn't live so far away. But when visiting talking stick will go again. Loved it. Miss my Chicago food. They have Vienna dogs jays chips. Everything"}
{"text":"I am from Boston and know my pizza,I will be polite and not even comment on there slices, all I can say is that I will not return."}
{"text":"I just love this place! Being from Chicago's south side, I know good food, great pizza and beef sandwiches/sausages. Chizona's has them all, great Chicago food located right here in Scottsdale. I drive all the way from Fountain Hills just because the food is worth the trip. They do offer seating but it's primarily a take out place. If your love great thin crust south side pizza and beef, you have to give this place a chance!!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch. I've tried a lot of things here. Pizza, Pizza Puffs, Pizza Sub, Chicago Dog, hell even the Gyro and they all have been good. Only thing I wasn't too fond of was the Italian Beef. But no worries, I just wont get that again. A lot of people don't like the fries (comes with most meals), but I like them. I think they make them in house. It's similiar to what you'll find at Zipps or Islands. The kind with the skin left on. Just dip it in their insanely good ranch and you're golden. Their ranch is homemade and is definitely the biz!"}
{"text":"One star for the decent chicken strips and fries with homemade ranch dressing, and one for the service cause the delivery guy was nice. However, the pizza crust tasted like stale leftover matzah. Then they cut it into little squares and you couldn't pick a piece up without making a mess. All I want is a good pizza pie and cut normal into slices! I just wasted $28 on a med pie and chx strips."}
{"text":"Great Chicago-style pizza! Their pizzas are a little on the greasy side depending on the amount of cheese and toppings. Convenient location to grab your food and go."}
{"text":"The crust is fantastic! Really like that a lot. The sauce is bland, but the toppings are good. The sauce for me is critical and if it was better I would say 4 stars minimum.

I had a sausage and mushroom pie, it took FOREVER but as it was a Friday night, not to surprised. 

The restaurant decor is over the top Chicago sports paraphernalia, which is cool because I am a Cubs fan, but the walls are dirty and need attention.

The staff are very nice if a little frazzled because this place is BUSY as they can be. They are doing something right because their delivery business is hopping on a Friday night."}
{"text":"You can take the boy out of Chicago but you can't take the Chicago out of the boy. Being from Chicago, I've been meaning to try this place for ages.I mean what a cool name, Chizona, pretty easy to figure it out, some McHenry, Illinois guys running a CHIcago place in ariZONA.

I was jonsing for their pizza since it smelled so good but after having pizza two days in a row, I opted for the Gyro and fries. The gyro came with onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce plus cut fries with the skins on them. I love the fries, they give you a very generous amount. The gyro was great as well, My wife loved their Italian Beef and said it was better than Al's Beef (sorry Al). My only complaint is there isn't a self serve soda machine, just cans of soda for a dollar. I'm definitely coming back for some pizza because it sure smells good.

I've just finished my own personal challenge of writing 100 reviews in 2012."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY Disgusting!!! We ordered pizza & cheese sticks- oil used to fry cheese sticks was  old/rancid. Couldn't get taste out of mouth- threw out a 65.00 dinner!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place, being a huge fan of Chicago Style food I was exctied to try this place. Parking was easy, it's right off the main road so if you're going west on Mcdonald you turn right into the lot.  The inside is decent enough,nice Chicago decor, a few autographed pictures and placards.  The temperature inside was a bit discomforting but since I was picking up a to-go order it was tolerable. We ordered a large cheese pizza, some chicken tenders,and some fries. The chicken was your basic breaded, nothing special, chicken tender, probably bought from Sysco or wherever they purchase their condiments from. The fries were the biggest dissapointment though, they tasted like they'd been microwaved, they were super soft and rubbery, had no texture at all, flavor was ok but way too mushy. The pizza was also dissapointing, it looked like it was gonna be good but I judged it by looks. Its cut into small squares which is fine,but the crust was just not a good thin crust. Maybe they use regular tap-water to make the dough? With the type of tap water we have here it's a big mistake to use it unfiltered.  So you have a great quality cheese,great sauce and flavors,but it's baked onto a crust that is pale,hard,inconsistent, rough to bite through. Maybe it was just me, but I will go back and try some other things because the service was friendly and the hot dogs looked great. Maybe its a better place to eat inside at,because I've never had fries that were so mushy."}
{"text":"I stop. Every time I am in town good hotdogs sub sandwiches great pizza and a good anti-pasta salad what more could you want"}
{"text":"It's moving day and we've just arrived in our new house with no food. Luckily, there's a Chicago-style pizza place just down the street with great Yelp reviews - of course, we tried it! 

The thin crust is well-executed, especially with fresh tomatoes - definitely yummy, hit the spot.  As an added bonus, the delivery guy is really nice, so good service delivered at your door with good pizza."}
{"text":"I, like many, have been driving by this place for the past 3 years since I started working in the area and decided to check it out about a month ago.  It was very reasonable for quite a bit of food and since I love pizza and love helping out locally owned shops, this was a perfect fit! Pizza was delicious, came with a salad and a soda (which I barely ever drink, but make an exception for every so often).  Very impressed.  When I saw the Groupon deal I didn't even wait five minutes before I was entering my card number.  Lunch was on me today for myself and my boss and I have to say, once again I am thoroughly impressed.  The pizza is delicious, the salad is fresh and the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  The man behind the counter, as before, was chatty and very nice and I will definitely be recommending this place to not only everyone in my building, but to friends as well.  I will also be visiting again when I am in need of a yummy pizza fix (which is quite often for me).  I suggest you do the same :)"}
{"text":"This place is a bummer,  
when the girl answer the phone it sounded like she drank a bottle of NyQuil,and then kept yawning throughout the check out process,
I'm disappointed about the food ,the pizza was like cheese on cardboard no flavor, I really don't think this establishment deserves to call themselves from  Chicago, it's kind of insulting  to someone who is eaten Chicago pizza my whole lifeI, I\"ll  go to Rosati's for Chicago pizza, and Portillo's for an Italian beef sandwich, 

plus if I were them I change the name it's goofy, sorry I gave you guys a chance,"}
{"text":"Small business restaurant with a neat interior theme based on Chicago sports.   Lots of Jordan stuff, which in a lebron-obsessed world is very nice. 

It has a small dive restaurant feel... But in a good way.  Cozy. 

They have RC cola as a fountain drink option.  Vey novel.  Haven't had RC in forever.  
The food is petty good.  Fries are nice and actually home made style.  Hotdogs are good too.  

I only take off one star because a guy who turned out to be their delivery driver came within inches of creaming me in the parking lot.... He really wanted a certain parking spot.  And he came in and hung out by the counter all the time I was eating.  Where's the fire, pal?"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of most chain pizza delivery spots. Because of that, I typically steer away from pizza delivery because I can't think of a good local spot that delivers in my area. But recently, I couldn't find it in me to leave my house and nothing in my refrigerator looked appealing, so I resorted to the quick and easy call to a pizza parlor. I did a Yelp search and found Chizona's which is practically down the street from me. I can't count the number of times I've driven by this little divey pizza shop and always wondered if it was good. Well, now I'm happy to finally share my report with the yelp world: it's more than good. It's delicious! 

The delivery process was pretty seamless. I called and ordered my pizza, paid over the phone and it was delivered to my doorstep in less than the 45 minute time frame they gave me. The delivery guy was clean cut and friendly which is important to me when I open my door up to a delivery person. 

So let's now move on to the food. The pizza was better than decent! It's cut into squares, with gooey cheese and nicely cooked bread. It's a couple notches above par but not quite gourmet level. It's pretty much ideal for a fatty pizza night. I ordered a side Cesar salad with it, but I should have asked for the dressing on the side because it was more like Cesar salad with a side of salad. 

After my experience and the quality of food, I will definitely become a regular of Chizona's and next time I will be sure to visit the restaurant itself and try the Chicago dog!"}
{"text":"Chicago Dogs the way they are supposed to be served! Fantastic and friendly staff. Excellent pizza. Doesn't look like much from the street but don't be fooled. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible!!  When I ordered a pizza delivery they put me on hold. I was then promised a 40 min delivery which is sub-par.  When I called an hour later I was met with attitude and they said the pizza was out the door.  I have a ton of patience but I would STRONGLY suggest not ordering from here.   They lied and all I wanted was a pizza."}
{"text":"I have long known the legend of Chizona's, but I just moved to the neighborhood! I have ordered twice off of grubhub, and every experience has been fantastic. Meatball Sub, both times. I have had other selections, and this takes the cake. Authentic Chicago style everything."}
{"text":"Beef and fries are great! Fries are fresh cut. Beef was large and bread was soft and did not break apart! They also have RC cola fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The roast beef sandwich is amazing. Fun cute little place to take the family. Love that they brought the sliders back."}
{"text":"Re-reviewing Chizona. I might have been a bit harsh. I went back last week and enjoyed my Hot Dog and actual fresh homemade fries. The place and employees looked a lot better. Areal plus is they serve RC cola."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, I am fairly particular. More often than not, when I try a new place, I leave disappointed. 

I happened to be driving past Chizona's Pizza and thought I'd stop in for a sandwich. The Italian Beef was outstanding, as were the fries. 

The next time I drove by, I decided to take the risk and try the pizza. It was fantastic. Really. The thin crust was perfect, the sauce magnificent, and the toppings generous. It was so good that although I live over 30 minutes away, if I am anywhere near Chizona's, I make it a point to stop in."}
{"text":"Wish I could have picked 4.5 stars- I don't give out 5 stars very often it this place was close. Picked up two pizzas on the way from the airport to our condo. Crust was crispy and lots of toppings. Mainly a takeout and delivery place- only a couple of tables."}
{"text":"I have had decent hotdogs here but the pizza is really gross. You can find much better chicago style food elsewhere for a better
 price."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! The polish sausage's are the best and their hot roast beef sandwiches are awesome! If you are ever around McDonald & Granite Reef in Scottsdale you have try this place! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"First time here! Got a pepperoni pizza \"Slice\", which is really two huge slices. OMG soooo good!"}
{"text":"Love this place,  I am right down the street from it.. great pizza and love the pizza sub... oh and the clasic pizza puffs.... awesome"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fingers which includes 5 large pieces and a large amount of fries which seem to be made there. Plus a side of ranch.

Chicken fingers were ok, obviously from a bag. Fries have the skin left on and are tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered: 1) gyro with fries 2) chizona dog with everything

The gyro was above average mostly because of the sauce. The fries were not good. They tasted soggy like they had been soaked in grease before fried. 

The hot dog was the highlight. The toppings were well portioned and made the dog a good meal. 

Bottom line: order the gyro but leave the fries. Get a hot dog with everything on it."}
{"text":"I'm a Chicago native that just moved to Arizona. Of course I came here for the pizza puff. It was delicious and I was not disappointed. I also tried the Chicago dog (perfect) and their Italian beef (pretty damn close). I foresee coming here many more times to get my Chicago food fix. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"First the most important part - the food here is great!  I love the pizza and am almost embarassed to say I eat here almost once a week (mostly delivery or take-out). I used to order the mozzarella sticks, but they've recently changed and I'm not as big a fan.

Another thing I love is that you can order online which makes things very convenient. I have signed up on the website and receive weekly coupons.

The only feedback I can give is that I have had online orders get lost, and it almost always takes at least an hour for an order to be ready. Knowing this you can just plan your order to be ready when you need.  This is the only reason it is not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great space and really friendly service. Love the neighborhood ambiance with police officers, construction workers and families all eating there for lunch. I had the Italian sandwich with fries and it was fantastic! Reasonable prices with super cool Chicago atmosphere. A great little \"joint!\""}
{"text":"Chizona is the best in the valley - Every meal is so flavorful - Also great owners & staff - 5Stars"}
{"text":"Awesome Meatball sandwich! I really like the pizza too! I have had the mozz sticks as well and their were decent, really big actually. They deliver which is also very convenient and the price is not too bad also. A good all around go to pizza joint. Next time I will have to try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I haven't had the Pizza here yet.  I'm a huge fan of Pizza, but the reason for my visit is Pizza Puffs.  Yes, those mouthwatering pocket filled morsels of goodness.....it's one of the food items I associate with Chicago.

When I heard this joint had Pizza Puffs, I immediately stopped by for lunch one day.  I ordered an Italian Sub & a Pizza Puff.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=32uwfuBXI-ig7g6METKPKA

The Italian Sub was served hot and came out first.  I kind of wish the Pizza Puff came out at the same time because it takes a little while for the Pizza Puff to cool off....but that's ok.

The Italian Sub was very good.  It was a nice sized portion, not too big & not too small, just right for lunch.  The Deli Meats are tasty served hot and the Bread was very good!

The Pizza Puff was brought out to me a short time later.  I couldn't wait to take a bite....hmmmm, it's just like they serve them in Chicago.  If you've never had a Pizza Puff, do yourself a favor and go out and try one as soon as possible....You'll be glad you did!

Overall, it was a nice lunch, satisfying my taste for Chicago.  They also serve Pizza and Dog's here, so I will be back!

{"text":"Today was our first visit to Chizona.  We ordered takeout on a Sunday evening.

Before we placed our order, we checked Prime Now Delivery and Eat24.  The prices were different on the two sites.  Additional ingredients are $1.00 on Amazon, $.75 on Eat24.  Amazon gives free delivery on orders over $35.

We arrived at the restaurant 5 minutes before the quoted time.  They were extremely busy.  New orders were being quoting 1 hour for pickup, longer for delivery.  Our order took an additional 20 minutes.  I don't fault the restaurant, accepting orders from so many sources (calls, Yelp, Amazon, etc.) must be challenging.  The staff was friendly, and apologized for the wait.

We ordered an Italian Beef sandwich, a calzone, a antipasto salad, and a combo appetizer.  When we got home, the food was still hot.  The sandwich was larger than I expected.  It came with hot peppers (free), and a side salad.  The calzone was very good, and also included a side of marinara and fries.  The combination (onion rings, zucchini, and mushrooms were still crispy.  The batter held up well.  The antipasto salad had a ton of meat and cheese.  It was a meal in itself.

We had a $5 coupon, and our order came out to $28.00.  This was a fantastic value for what we received.  The quality and portion size were well above what we expected, and was worth the wait.  We look forward to visiting Chizona again."}
{"text":"Pizza is not very good delivery was late and the girl on the phone was less than professional going as far as to tell my wife that 1 bad review didn't matter.  If you choose this place for delivery then go with God, ur gonna need his help."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic, but pass on the Gyro.....They should take it off the menu and just sell Pizza.  If someone never had the pizza and just ate the Gyro they might not go back and they would be missing out on some very good za!  I am from Chicago and this tastes like home, but I will pass on the gyro!"}
{"text":"The food is very good , but the service stinks. There have been times when I can't get through on the phone for an hour. Tonight really was the icing on the cake. I ordered a pizza at 545 and was told it would take \"over an hour\". Now when I think over an hour I'm thinking an hour and a half or so.  An hour and 45 minutes rolls around and I called and the only explanation I got was that they were busy. Totally cool, I've been in the service industry I get that things don't always go as planned. It has now been 2 hours and 15 minutes and I still don't have a pizza. Not too happy and pretty hungry... Oh and even better just got the pizza , it was not even close to warm so I threw it away and ordered a new one from Rosatis. I did appreciate them crediting my card back. Never again though .."}
{"text":"Oh, hell YES! 

I am somewhat embarrassed to admit I have lived in the Valley since 1995, yet just today was my maiden voyage to the hidden gem known as Chizona's. As a Chicago girl through-and-through, I go through various stages of withdrawl for the culinary delights native to the city, including but not limited to pizza puffs and green and pink cookies shaped like leaves and dipped in chocolate, sold only at Jewel. (Although, apparently, not anymore, after I dashed in and out of no less than six Jewels looking for them during my most recent pilgrimage, eyes rolling back in my head from the tragedy of it all.)

So, yeah. Chizona's. Total hole in the wall... but you're not coming here for the ambiance. The \"side\" salad/\"one\" slice and pop combo, clocking in at a staggering $6, gives you a ginormous fresh salad with crisp Romaine lettuce, chunks of tomato, black olives, and a handful of shredded mozzarella, served in a Styrofoam bowl, natch. It's practically big enough to be a meal on its own... but then you face the \"slice\" of pizza, which is really a quarter of a huge pizza, cut perfectly into the beloved squares. Gooey and greasy, with a thin crust that grows delightfully cracker-y towards the edges... we are talking down-home, for real Chicago goodness. The pizza puff (which I had to sample for austerity's sake) is a delectable deep-fried gooey handful of cheesy and perfectly seasoned sausage-y joy. Oh, heaven.

The various hot sandwiches -- Italian beef, etc. -- are served on the Holy Grail of Chicagoland bread, Gonella bread, and they are humongous. The fries on the side are so-so, but you can bet your sweet ass I'm not wasting precious gastric space on fries when there's pizza perfection to be had.

Oh delicious and heavenly joyousness. Next time you're too busted to spring for a Southwest ticket to Midway and are feeling the sting of homesickness... just pop in here. These creature comforts will dull the pain... temporarily, at least. Now, if they would only sell the pink and green leaf cookies!"}
{"text":"Customer Service is horrible! I understand it's a Sunday and playoffs are on but for someone to just flat out rude on the phone, and give the customer attitude is not OK! I decide not to order from this place. The women (i think Deb) called me back strictly to argue with me, said her peace and then hung up on me after I asked for her name! DO NOT ORDER FROM here."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious.  The thin crust is perfect and they are very generous with their toppings.  Authentic Chicago Hot Dogs, Sliders, Beef Sandwiches are all the bomb. And i know because I was born and raised in Chicago proper for 30 years.

{"text":"What a DIVE! It's a dive, but it fits perfectly with my image of what a Chicago Dog House should look like. The guy that greeted me at the counter in his white t-shirt (undershirt) further exemplified the Chicago experience. 

When you look into the kitchen you can see bags of potatoes. These turned out to be the beginnings of a huge serving of pipping hot, hand cut fires. They were wonderful!

I had a hard time deciding between the tatsy looking pizza and the dog. The dog won and my diet lost. There were so many tremendous attributes to this, what could have been a basic, hot dog. The steamed poppy seed bun was perfectly steamed. The hot dog was tasty. and best of all, I didn't even have to ask for them to add hot peppers to the dog. It came with relish, onions, pickles, jalapenos, salt and pepper on top. WOW!

The entire experience far exceeded my expectations that had been set from first seeing the shabby looking outdoor appearance."}
{"text":"Ok let's start off by saying my order took over 2 hours because miscommunication... When my food arrived the guy who delivered was kind of a dick. He seemed disappointed with his 3 dollar tip while also charging a delivery fee lI was disappointed with the horrible communication. I am in the hospital and lucky me the dick spilled an Au jus inside the bag. So for communication and delivery they get 1 star 0 really.

The Italian dip on the other hand was really flavorful and delicious. Sadly because the guy who delivered I will no longer order from here. Customer service is just as important as the food. The lady on the phone was nice but her husband or whatever he was killed my desire to order from them again. They got 3 stars because I'm not that big of a dick.  Step up your customer service and you will be solid, BTW \"tips are not mandatory and you should have been happy I gave you 3 after waiting forever."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  Waited an hour and a half.   Was missing items in my order.  The food I did order arrived soggy and cold.  Food was pretty much uneatable."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe that this small place packed such a big punch!!!!! The pizza was fantastic and the super simple dinner salad was soooo good! It's affordable, fun, and so tasty. Just wish they were open more. Always find myself craving Chizona's when they aren't open. ugh. Anyway, I will work my schedule around this awesome eatery."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I just ordered the worst gyro of my life. The meat was way over cooked, crispy!  I was starving so I ate it, don't recommend this place especially for the gyro being 10$"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I called to order 3 sandwiches for employees at Saguaro High School. Woman who answered the phone was extremely rude. I had asked for half of the sandwiches to have no cheese and light sauce. She immediately became very irritated with this request. Told me that they don't make the sandwiches that way, they were going to have to cut them in half (I replied that wouldn't be a problem for us), said she was going to have to explain this to the cooks and made sure to sigh multiple times in her annoyance at our extremely \"difficult\" order . When asking for the name on the order I had to repeat 3 times throughout the conversation because she was so caught up on how she was going to figure out how to cut these sandwiches in half. When she told me the pick up time I told her thank you and that I appreciated it. She followed that by hanging up. 
My coworker called back asking if she had an issue with our order. She replied that it was a difficult order and that's not how they typically made the sandwiches. My coworker explained that I was frustrated when getting off the phone with her because of the way she spoke to me. She responded \"Well I was just as frustrated to have to take the order.\" At that point he informed her to cancel our order and that she just lost customers. 
Called Casella's instead, extremely friendly customer service and no issue with making the sandwich's no cheese and light on sauce. Chizona's loss is Casella's gain."}
{"text":"Moved from Gilbert and ordered Chizona's on moving day!  Pizza was delicious and fresh, and quick delivery too!"}
{"text":"Good food, big pizza. Can buy by the slice which is very cool. I'd recommend, and certainly if you're getting Italian food, specifically pizza, don't buy from the corporate chains. Support local business."}
{"text":"I recently moved near Chizona and was excited to get a taste of Chicago. Being from Illinois I've had plenty of food from Chicago and was expecting the pizza to be deep dish but the thin crust style was still very good. I plan on trying more of their foods but as of right now I can say that the pizza is worth a try."}
{"text":"We've gone here before and the food is okay but without clarifying they charged us an extra $12 for a pizza that showed as $14 online which was $26 for a greasy, disgusting pizza. If they are going to be uncharging that much, they should clarify ahead of time. Barros is a way better, more cost effective option than this. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  Definitely the best u have had around this art of Scottsdale.  I really like their crust and the sausage."}
{"text":"When I read the other reviews for this place I had to double check that I had the right pizza place. 
It was our first night in our house and we had no food. We decided to try Chizona's since it is literally five minutes from the house. 
This is the most horrible pizza I have ever had. I mean it was really bad. The crust came straight from the freezer and you could tell. It was bad all the way through. My husband and I each thought it was equally bad and ended up throwing the entire thing away. 
We vowed to never go back. It is really that bad."}
{"text":"It's a shame that Chizona's doesn't put more of an effort in making even a average pizza. The crust is horrible. It taste like a saltine cracker, no flavor at all. This was our first time trying their pizza and it surely will be the last. Don't waste your money and time."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because we live close by. Unfortunately, each time I've called to place a delivery order it's been a nightmare. They are very disorganized! Maybe it's better if you dine in the restaurant. We've ordered pizza from them twice now and both times we were disappointed with the quality of food and the overall experience- particularly placing our order over the phone."}
{"text":"I have to admit to not trying anything on the menu besides the pizza. It's PIZZA in the name, and since I tried my first one I can't think about ordering anything else. I have been to Chicago many times and sorry but I'm not a fan of deep dish no matter how many tries at it. Give me that low thin crust with a nice fresh cheese and excellent toppings.

First off, this cheese doesn't taste like the others. Like many I ordered chain pizza for convenience. After finding Chizona you remember what pizza should taste like. The cheese is a standout. Something about it just tastes so fresh and it has real flavor. 

Thank you Chizona for your attention to flavor. The sauce, the cheese, pepperoni... ohhh!!! Remember this isn't the thick heavy bread tons of extra flavorless cheese pizza. if you're a fan of thin crust with lots of flavor fan then this is the pizza for you."}
{"text":"If you love mediocre frozen pizza made by terrible service, you will love this place. My husband and I decided to try it after the raving reviews and have been left $26 poorer and very unsatisifed. 

The service was awful. Very unfriendly and when we went to pick up our order the phone rang and the employee literally huffed and puffed, acted like she didn't want to order it and rolled her eyes like \"oh great, more business\". 

There is a freezer in eyesight of the cash register and it is stocked with frozen bags of chicken fingers. Seriously, go to Frys and buy your own. 

We got a salad and pizza. The pizza was thin crust and literally tasted like frozen, premade dough. Very very disappointing. If this is what pizza of Chicago tastes like, I will not be heading to Chicago anytime soon. 

Go to Barros. Thank me later."}
{"text":"My husband and I are very budget conscious but when we like to splurge on pizza, we think of Chizonas, really good Chicago style pizza and convenient! They are right down the street from us and best of all they do deliver. The only downfall is sometimes our orders can get a little expensive but it's nice to have a change compared to dominoes or Pizza Hut. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it was Pizza Den.  Chizona is my go to hangover cure.  The pizza is bomb and the ranch is yummy.  The people are nice and I like that I am supporting a neighborhood establishment.  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome place me and a couple buddies go in on each week and get the extra large pie at my office i would highly recommend this place to anyone keep it up Chizona's you guys are awesome"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I go there at least once a week.  I would going on A Wednesday since they get there meat on Tuesday night.  Order the Chizona's(there fries are the best) , Supreme pizza!  IT IS THE BEST"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  If you like thin crust pizza then this is the place to get it.  Its authentic Chicago thin crust and incredibly delicious.  Honestly, I dont know how the big chain pizza places stay in business with excellent Chizona Pizza around.   Salads are big and always fresh.   Okay, so thats the good news.  Now the flip side:  The staff are not pleasant or unpleasant... just sorta there to take your order, ring you up and get your food.  I have been going there for 8 years and its always been that way with pretty much the same folks working.  Skip the online ordering - works almost all the time but on rare occasion it gets glitchy and its no more work to give them a call.  The online menu prices are not always kept up to date.  You probably wont want to eat there although there are tables inside because it can get really smoky and hot from the pizza ovens. 
All said, I keep going back for absolutely superb pizza - just call in your order and pick it up and you will be hooked too."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. The food is always delicious and the staff is always incredibly nice, even while we stand at the counter bickering over what we're going to get. I usually stick to the deal of the pizza, salad, and drink -- can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Enormous slice pizza. Very tasty, great atmosphere. Great price. Customer service was great. Would highly recommend the pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza was cut up into small slices and very dry. Like they had given me a piece that was reheated and had been seating under the a heat lamp since the beginning of time. Philly cheesesteak more like the \"really weak shit\" had no real flavor to it. The wait time was 10 mins, we were the only two people in there at the time so im not sure why it took so long. People that took my order seemed dead and very tired, barely said a word. Better pizza places in the area for sure."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here a few times now and Chizona's has never disappointed, the pizza has been great every time. We also love the cheese garlic bread. Being from the Midwest, I was also very happy to find a place with a good pizza puff. I haven't had the hot dog yet but I've only heard good things - can't wait to try a couple.

Go Sox!"}
{"text":"sorry I didn't discover this place years ago. fast deliverypizza was very flavorful  and calzone out of this, world."}
{"text":"This place makes the most amazing pizza. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the last 3 times I've ordered from them for dinner I've had to wait nearly 2 hours for my delivery. If you order from here, I'd advise placing your order early."}
{"text":"I lived next door for almost a year before I finally tried this place. Sure glad I did too, the pizza here is thin, crispy, and the sauce is a spicy perfection. Their hot wings are good too! Also try their Greek Salad with a huge pile of tasty gyro meat - Wow! PLEASE try this place before you order another pie from Domino's or Pizza Hut!!! (I recommend delivery or take out - the restaurant's decor is underwhelming)."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood pizza joint. We recently moved to the area and tried Chizona pizza on a whim. We were completely surprised by the quality and flavor of the food coming out of this little restaurant. We have since ordered several pizzas for delivery and they are not soggy or cold. I'd highly recommend Chizona Pizza for your next pizza delivery."}
{"text":"This is based on experience alone, I've never eaten here because the first time the man that answered the phone was super rude and we hung up the phone immediately and decided not to be lazy and make the oh so worth it drive to little Chicagos. My wife and I decided to get over ourselves and really wanted wings so we called again, guess what? They were out of wings, seriously? It's 7:30pm and you're out of wings?? Thy girl couldn't even be bothered to fake say sorry. Do yourself a favors if you're in the area don't be lazy and just go to little Chicagos. They are consistent the prices are fair and they don't run out of chicken wings!"}
{"text":"We moved to the South Scottsdale area about a week before Thanksgiving. Being from Chicago, this was the pizza we had to try. The food is amazing, but the customer service stinks. We've ordered 5 times at least and have had a major delay 2 out of those 5 times. Tonight I placed an order for pickup. It is a 40 minute pickup time, but since the food is great, I agree. I arrived on time for pickup to discover that the woman hadn't even added the wings on to our order. I asked how long for the wings. She tells me 20 minutes. I told her to forget the wings, we'll just take the rest of the order. She then tells me that the order isn't ready and that I am looking at another 20 minutes. Tired from just arriving from a plane trip, I agree to pay upfront and have them deliver. I noticed while I was there that they had taken the phones off the hook because they couldn't accommodate any more orders. Even with $10 off the bill, I am outraged! It took almost another hour for them to deliver the food I had paid for upfront. I tried calling, but phones were still not being answered. No pizza is worth an 1 hour and 40 minute delivery time!!! Especially when it was supposed to be a pick up order to begin with. Good food, but poorly managed. If you have that much business, hire more help and do right by your customers!!! Will not be customers again unless management changes. Too bad, loved their food!"}
{"text":"During the day the service is great. Debbie the daytime manager is phenomenal. The person that works the night shift is the most awful person I've ever experienced in the service industry. Tonight we are promised order within one hour. An hour and a half later we calling to check on her order. We were told that other customers had priority because they ordered first in our order would be delivered soon. The nighttime manager then tells me that the rest of the route had to be delivered before they can get to me. I was less than one block away. The food shows up it's ice cold in the delivery driver has an attitude. Please be aware do not do business with this company after 4 PM. If you do so you'll be highly disappointed."}
{"text":"1st time here.... had the deal 1 item slice pizza with drink, 5.99..... excellent, 1 big slice cut into squares... thin crust...
I'll be back to try different food items"}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials here. Whether you go with the Slice/Salad or Two Chicago Dogs/Fries, you can't go wrong. Or do what I do and go with the best of both worlds: a Slice/One Chicago Dog.

Worth it every time!"}
{"text":"...if you like having enough salt on your pizza to kill a full grown horse, this is your kind of pizza.... I will never eat there again. The owner made no effort to compensate for the worst pizza I have ever eaten. Sorry, there are far better places in Scottsdale to get a pizza than this \"joint\"."}
{"text":"A little hole-in-the-wall kind of gem that has delicious eats. I was in the mood for some serious grub that wouldn't break my bank, and thanks to Yelp, I stumbled upon this place with 4-stars and one dollar sign. Perfect. It lived up to my expectations! 

I ordered the ChiZona hot dog and homemade french fries. This is the kind of hot dog that you need to order as is, Chicago style, with all the yummy fixings to make it great. The french fries are really good, crispy, crunchy, and they give you a large portion. 

My boyfriend got the Italian beef sandwich and he was very happy with his order. It was a giant sandwich so he ended up taking half of it home. Luckily, he is moving closer to ChiZona so I have a feeling we will be eating there quite often. We both left full and happy for less than $20 altogether! 

Excited to try their pizza and chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are awesome.  You get plenty of food for a very small amount of scratch.  However... Chicago Style, it is not.  Not even close.  Regardless, it's a good little place if you're on a budget and cravin some pizza."}
{"text":"They have awesome pizza and wings, their Italian beef sandwich is even better. It's the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I had just about given up on finding a REAL Italian beef sandwich like you can find in Chicago-I've lived here for almost 16 years and this is the very best Italian beef that I have found...I;ve heard their pizza and dogs are also wonderful,I just can't go in without ordering the beef  Thank you Chizona"}
{"text":"great pizza, but we recently ordered for the office, and went to pick it up, the girl never gave us the cups for our drinks, hot peppers on the beef instead of sweet , and she REPEATED the order!! The chizona sliders were  on soggy  buns.. 
the folks at the office were NOT impressed after my recommendation  bummer. the place could be a freakin GOLD MINE...... 
The gal while on the phone was pretty rude, like we were interrupting her...."}
{"text":"Delicious! I am a Chicago native, and not many places out here can get an Italian beef sandwich right, but Chizona's was great. And the fries were amazing!! Delivery took a while, and they forgot my sides of cheese and ranch, but it was a Friday night so I'm sure they were busy, and they threw in an extra order of fries so I appreciated that. I can't wait to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Fairly good cheese pizza here, especially the slices at lunch time.  Nice thin crust that is reminiscent of thin crust examples I've had in Chicago.  Fries are very good as well, and the portion size is very generous.  Negatives, though, are that there's hardly any parking and the place doesn't exactly feel very inspiring with the cleanliness.  Why do they have those privacy drapes for the kitchen doorway anyway - what are they hiding?"}
{"text":"Gotta have the fries!  Specials are amazing, pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"I agree 100% with Lisa T's review!  When I got married and moved down to this part of Scottsdale, I was missing my old takeout and delivery joints.  Then I saw Chizona's sign out front on McDonald, googled their number and ordered up a spinach, garlic and Canadian bacon pie and bye-bye blues!  Chizona's delivers hot, thin-crust (cut in squares) delicious pizza time and time again.  And as I said, Lisa's right; the salads always great too.  None of that bagged crap-- just fresh cut romaine and/or green leaf lettuce with a nice bit of toppings.  And, yes, the homemade ranch is awesome!!  They also have really good wings, Chicago dogs and calzones.  Did I mention that they bring it to your house?  Family owned takeout joint with food made by people who care.  Yeah, it's old and dingy inside, but the food and service rock!  And again, they bring it to your house!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I work at the Scotsdale Salt River Courtyard thats around the corner from this place & I'm a regular there. I always order a slice of Sausage & Jalepeno pizza with a side of their homemade fries & ranch! Always consistant , always delivered within 30-45 minutes. A MUST try."}
