{"text":"Perfect. Perfect service. 
Fresh vegetables. Amazing fish. Wonderful wine selection. Anything else ?
Yes, Portuguese food needs to be discovered. Here is the best place to do so!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing place. Food, service, atmosphere, everything. We were going for a bunch of tapas, and friendly and knowledgeable staff suggested to do a la carte for $55pp which got us 6 tapas and desert. She helped us picking out the perfect menu and wines to go with it. It was perfect. Asparagus salad and rabbit stuffed with fig were my favorite. I went to get breakfast at Cantinho de Lisboa that morning by accident without knowing it was Helena's as well. I'm her big fan now, too bad I didn't get her book.."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great service and great food. I ordered a steak with chorizo sauce on top of thin potato strips it was amazing. The waiters made sure we had a good experience. This is definitely a good restaurant to take your love one to a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Even though we had a reservation and the restaurant was by no means full, our party of four was seated in the graveyard section of the restaurant where we were the only guests and even the waiters barely made it back there. It was an ominous start to a bad evening. 

The food was a mixed bag: Appetizers were excellent, especially the mussels with chorizo. We all had seafood mains, and they were generally executed ok though all of them were over-salted, especially the sauces. Some were only moderately salty and some were barely edible. We pointed out to the waitress that some of the vegetables tasted as if they'd been dropped in a vat of salt, and she said she'd advise the kitchen but never returned with an explanation. Desserts were uninspiring. Natas were good though served with unripe fruit, which I can tolerate in February but not in August. A fruit tartlet was a Frankensteinian concoction of a chocolate bisquit topped with cream, fruit and a white chocolate shell. It didn't help that it tasted like it had been made two or three days ago. 

Service was mediocre throughout and awfully slow, probably a result of us having been seated in the far back. d

I had been to Portuscalle before, which was one of the owner's other restaurant before it closed down a couple of months ago. I loved Portuscalle, but the experience at Helena was a disappointment. We won't go back. There are too many good restaurants in Montreal to waste time and money on the mediocre and overpriced ones such as Helena."}
{"text":"As part of a work function, I attended a dinner at Restaurant Helena.  We were a group of ~10, and set-menu was provided for us to choose from.  The service and the food were both excellent.

For appetizers, we were served platters of grilled asparagus salad with serrano ham;  tomato and goat cheese mousse salad, octopus salad and grilled chorizo.  Servings were very generous, and everything was so delicious that most of us were full before our entrees!  In particular, I would order the asparagus salad again;  the combination of the saltiness of the ham with the sweetness of the asparagus was perfect.  The octopus was grilled to perfection;  a slight chewiness without being rubbery, and the vinaigrette made for a very fresh taste.

I had ordered a pork loin with red wine and mushroom sauce (our choices on our set menu were sirloin steak, fish, seafood rice dish (the name was portuguese) and the pork loin).  Being a mushroom lover, I was swayed towards the pork loin.  The serving was again, very generous.  There were 5-6 medallions of pork loin.  They were encrusted in a peppery marinade.  Good thing I eat fairly spicy foods, but at one point, I did find the peppers overwhelming and the crust was a bit salty.  Due to the large serving size, I sadly left two pork loin medallions behind.

Dessert for our group were a couple of platters, with mini natal, passion fruit panna cottas,  lemon curd, meringue, chocolate chip cookies, dried fruits, etc.  Sadly much was left behind because we were all too full.

If the experience for individual diners (not as a reserved group) matches our experience, then Helena is definitely a destination when in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"This meal was one of the best I've had. We got the medium tasting menu that started us off with 5 different small plates that were absolutely stunning. The four of us then each received a main course of pig trotter and sirloin. To top it off a literal trough of sm desserts were presented and I got a latte that made everything perfect. 10/10 in my opinion and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boss invited my husband and I here, one of his favorite restaurants. When we got there, they couldn't find our reservation. They gave us a table anyway. Our waiter hardly spoke english or french.  The appetizers were ok. My boss ordered a second glass of wine and never got it. As a main dish, I ordered a beef dish. It was tough and full of fat (more fat than meat). For dessert, had sorbet but it was \"granuleux\". My boss ordered an espresso and finally got when we were ready to leave.  Then, the waiter came back and told my boss he didn't leave enough tip. Tip for what? Horrible service and bad food? I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"There was 4 of us for lunch. It was absolutely wonderful. Three of us had salmon and one had lamb. The taste was to die for.  The price for lunch table d'hote was 22 dollars. For appetizer main and dessert. What a bargain for such good food.  The service also was impeccable. Very informed waiters love love loved it"}
{"text":"Inconsistent.  The things that worked were amazing - asparagus salad, desserts, salmon - all three were so good I'd go back for them...but the things that were not so great were dramatically less so.  The cod, in particular, was uninspiring.  The service was also inconsistent. Great when our waitress remembered us,  but she forgot us several times."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel, and boy was she right! Fantastic service, and amazing food. Everything was delicious, and I will definitely be going back on our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Before I start raving about how good was the restaurant let me mention that I only made the reservation at Helena because I couldn't get a reservation at any all highly rated place in Montreal.  Note to self: \"make plans in advance\".  
How come this place only has like a dozen reviews?  The ambiance is so elegant and energetic.  Pictures don't do justice.  Food was impeccable.  For appetizers we had grilled chouriço, pork cheeks with chestnuts and grilled squid (this one was just ok).  For entrée we got layered duck confit.  I usually have mixed feelings about duck dishes but oh that duck confit was so tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Restaurant Helena was absolutely stunning! I enjoyed the scallops with sweetcorn puree, maple bacon marmalade and fois gras for starters, the seafood plate for main and tried both the custard tarts and pumpkin and almond pie for dessert. Each course was as brilliant as the last. I would recommend all three!

The staff were lovely, the service was fast, the restaurant was beautiful and the food magnificent."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening and everything was fantastic. From the moment we walked, we were taken care of. Our waiter, Steve, was very prompt, efficient, knowledgeable, and friendly without being overbearing - some of the best service I've had in a while. We shared the asparagus salad and the parrilhada (seafood in a buttery piri-piri broth served with seasonal vegetables) and everything was exquisite. It's not the kind of place I can afford to go to often, but it's definitely worth it for a special night out!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Helena is incredible. It's one of the finest restaurants I've been to in years. The ambiance and elegance are difficult to match. My wife and I did cartwheels and splits over the place. The next time I'm in Montreal this restaurant will be the first place I stop.

I have a marinade recipe for grilled halibut that's wonderful. Whenever I go to a restaurant and they have halibut I get it automatically. This evening this glorious restaurant had halibut as the fish of the day. The way they grilled it was out of this world. The dish was complemented with an assortment of vegetables and potatoes. It was perfection. My wife loved her seafood stew too. I need to return for shrimps and scallops. The menu is vast.

A wonderful man named Mario seems to run things a bit. He gave us glasses of port on the house when we first sat down. When our dinner was slightly delayed he gave us more appetizers. He basically treated us like royalty. I'm not sure why. Maybe he thought I wrote reviews for the New York Times. A simply wonderful staff at this beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 4 stars after some thought.
The decor and vibe are nice, even romantic.
We were 7 people and maybe because of that the service was terrible. We had to constantly ask for water, wait for an hour for our main course, etc. So don't go there for the service. 
This could go into service or food category but here it is: those cod croquetas that our server recommended, well, they are terrible. If we had no tastebuds, maybe we could have liked them. Please get rid of those or upgrade them to be creamy and delicious. Right now those are dry, leathery and stringy.
The grillade for 2 is amazing though! It's smoky from the grill, the seafood is cooked just right and the sauce it comes in is delicious. We wanted to drink it! If you go to Helena, you have to go there for the grillade."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restos du Vieux Montreal, je crois qu'il mérite ses 5 étoiles. Toutes mes expériences ont été sans défaut, à la fois au niveau de la qualité des plats servis que du service et des conseils qui m'ont été offerts. Si vous êtes plutôt sur un budget, essayez d'y aller le midi l'expérience est très comparable à des prix vraiment exceptionnels. C'est mon option business lunch favorite du centre-ville/vieux Montréal. Et tous ceux à qui je l'ai conseillé ont aussi beaucoup aimé. Valeur sûre!"}
{"text":"Having been to Helena's cafe Cantinho de Lisboa that morning and loving the atmosphere and the food, we were anxious to try Helena's food at her restaurant that night. 

To our shocking surprise, the service unbelievably terrible. My wife and our one year old were on a vacation in Montreal. We brought our little guy to the restaurant in a stroller since it was late and he was fast asleep. Despite having several seats available in the front of the restaurant, the host sat us all the way in the back making another table get up so that we could wheel our stroller in. It was an embarrassing situation for many. I guess they didn't want us to ruin their style by having a stroller by fine tables in the front. 

We didn't have the menus at first - again shows the terrible job the host was doing. Our waiter comes by 15mins later, realizes we don't have menus, drops the menus by, and disappears again for 30mins. 45mins have gone by after sitting down and no one has even taken our order. When the waiter finally comes by, he flips out when I tell him there has been a significant wait to just put in an order.

Needless to say we couldn't stay there any longer. We had to make the other table get up again so that we could wheel our stroller out. The manager tried to mitigate the issue by NOW offering us the table in the front but that consideration came way too late in the process and there was nothing that restaurant that could fix the evening."}
{"text":"Went there on a weekday as I noted their special lunch menu (entre, main meal, desert for 24$), which is a pretty good deal!
Restaurant decor is super nice, classy. Most customers were well dressed business people working in the downtown area. Not a baby friendly restaurant as there wasn't any high chair available only booster, but we did bring our own. Also, not easy to find parking during weekdays in this busy area. 
I ordered the \"Mille feuille étage de raie\", their grilled cod and finished off with the chocolate eclair. Loved every bites! 
We were a party of 4 and each appreciated their meals. They have a variety of choices included with the special lunch menu. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent resto portugais du quartier des affaires. Le poisson est frais et bien apprêté, les saveurs sont délicates et soigneusement choisies, et le personnel est courtois. Les entrées sont créatives sans s'éloigner de la tradition portugaise. Un excellent choix pour un lunch d'affaire."}
{"text":"Too bad there is no single baby chair, and no place to change diaper!  Unbelievable !"}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood and very friendly service! We had the tapas to share and really enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allées dans le cadre de Montréal à table et avons adoré notre soirée.
Le service est à la perfection, digne d'un grand restaurant mais sans trop en faire, la bouffe était excellente: carpaccio de morue délicieux, petit sandwich de porc (typique apparemment) très bon aussi, poisson du jour bon mais peu copieux, ragoût de fruits de mer excellent, et desserts très bons aussi (nous avons juste été un peu surprises par la pâte du profiterole qui était assez épaisse, plus qu'à l'habitude..)
Bref, le resto était plein, et ce n'est pas étonnant compte tenu du rapport qualité-prix qui est très correct.
C'est sûr qu'à ce prix-là, je n'irai pas tous les jours, alors s'il y a d'autres promos du type Mtl à table je tâcherai de ne pas les manquer! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious meal filled with seafood. The seafood parrilhada platter for two is worth the $61, and was filled with shrimp, octopus and calamari. Service was impeccable. I highly recommend visiting Helena for Portuguese food."}
{"text":"Helena helena helena.....

Just fantastic. Great produces. Great taste. Great ambiance.

J'adore cette place pour un lunch de midi. Service impeccable. Le menu change tout le temps. Les produits sont frais et le dessert a coupé le souffle.

Il faut aimer les produits de mer et aussi le melange de saveur est toujours une decouverte. Les plats sont travaillés et tres bien présentés! 

Ideal pour un diner en couple et l'ambiance est chic et classy. Nappe blanche et serviette bien pliées.

Rdv a midi!!"}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce restaurant grâce à sa participation à l'événement \"MTL à Table 2014\". Je dois dire que nous ne sommes pas particulièrement enthousiastes à l'idée d'essayer un resto dans le cadre de promotion de ce genre... nous avons été échaudées quelque peu par notre essai de \"Toqué!\" il y a deux ans ou le personnel regardait les convives venus pour \"MTL à table\" comme la \"pleb\" trop \"cheap\" pour payer le plein prix. Cette année d'ailleurs \"Toqué!\" y participe, mais à un niveau de prix beaucoup plus élevé.

Pour en revenir à \"Helena\" donc, ils participaient au niveau de prix le plus haut parmi les restos réguliers, soit le $39. Ici, pas du tout d'attitude négative! Une réception et un service très professionnel. Une ambiance chaleureuse avec des éléments qui rappelle la péninsule ibérique, mais de façon contemporaine et dynamique.

Ce resto propose une cuisine d'inspiration portugaise, mais interprétée par son excellente chef/propriétaire qui menait sa cuisine ouverte de main de maître. Les plats nous été servis promptement, mais sans l'ombre de pression, nous donnant tout notre temps pour apprécier la cuisine, l'ambiance et la compagnie de mon grand amour qui profitait de la soirée avec moi.

Les prix pour le menu régulier sont également accessible et je dirais que c'est même un excellent \"deal\" pour la haute qualité de l'expérience. Nous serons sans doute de retour!"}
{"text":"Loved the service and the food. We did a tasting menu of tapas, ending with a Branzino. Everything was tasty and not heavy. It had a very modern vibe and took classic favors to new heights. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for work about a month ago and my Canadian colleagues took me to Restaurant Helena. Having traveled quite a bit I am always up for different cuisines. The restaurant itself is quaintly located in Old Montreal and the atmosphere is great, with beautifully set tables, very attentive staff and an overall welcoming vibe. 

As for the food: we ordered the tapas menu which then came with a main entree of red snapper. All of the tapas were amazing, I especially liked the large scallop with the foie gras on top as well as the octopus. The wine kept coming and the service was terrific. It is relatively pricey for my standards but well worth it. I think it came out to about $50-75 per person without drinks.

Overall, a wonderful experience, likely the highlight of my trip to Montreal. Looking forward to returning at some point."}
{"text":"Helena Loureiro's high end sister restaurant to Portus Calle. The food is five star and the service impeccable. It's setting in the old part of Montreal provides a context evocative of Lisbon. The seafood is magnificent. The octopus warrants special mention. I only give it four stars because of its high noise level. It detracts from the dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Portuguese cuisine. Great seafood selection & meat. Very nice ambiance. Great for dinner with friends or business."}
{"text":"J'ai été initiée à ce resto dans le cadre de Mtl à table 2014. 
Malheureusement, je pense donner un 3/5 par obligation et respect pour le nom.
Entrée: salade d'asperges...du déjà vu...rien d'un grand restaurant
Plat principal: riz aux fruits de mer (sorte de risotto tomaté)...belle présentation. fruits de mer frais et bien cuits...par contre, sans saveur ou particularité propre qui me fera revenir. 
Plat que je serais capable de reproduire aisément à la maison.
Dessert: natas. bien réussi sans plus. Loin de battre la petite pâtisserie sur la \"main\" entre deux buildings"}
{"text":"La camarera fue bastante maja. El único problema fue con la música. Fue como si estuviéramos en una discoteca con el nivel de volumen con bass horrible. Además ella causó un derrame de cerveza y por eso, necesitamos cambiar mesas. Más o menos nos gustaron las raciones. Sin embargo, el volumen continuó siendo un problema. Quizás la dueña cree q ella es una protégé de Björk... Joder..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few weeks ago and I have to say that their $22 table d'hote is a superb deal! You have a choice from three appetizers, four mains, plus a dessert. You could also choose to order from their regular tapas/mains menu instead but it definitely isn't as cost-effective. Wine is where they get you - it is a nice list of Portuguese wines though, and there are many options by the glass.

My spouse started with a pureed potato soup (I think it had a chicken broth base - creamy and delicious), and I chose the burrata (think of the creamiest fresh cheese curd sprinkled with sea salt, on a bed of mixed greens with pistachios and pine nuts - swoon!). For mains, we chose the grilled mahi mahi (perfectly flaky) and a seafood stew (tomato-based, loaded with mussels, shrimp, and fish). Dessert was a cream puff served with a variety of fresh, ripe fruit. I was pleased to see that they didn't skimp on quality and presentation even though it was just lunch.

Decor is amazing (think modern Portuguese, a mix of new and old) and so is the ambiance - busy but not just with business folks. Waitress was very prompt and attentive.

Overall I would go again and definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner at Helena a little while ago. Can't remember what i had but i remember food being delicious, well presented tapas and service was great. Id go back again yes!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much. We were a party of 18. The service is magnificent! So prompt and attentive. When I told them I don't eat pork, they got my my own special small tapas devoid of pork! I liked everything I had here. Nothing stood out too much. We had a set tasting menu. For my main dish I would have liked the steak but it is made with pork sauce, so I passed. I had a seafood pasta which was good, above average. I liked my dining experience here. The dessert was good but there wasn't enough of itt. They brought enough so that we'd each have 3 bite sized desserts (mini cake, mini tart and a churro). I'd recommend this place and I'd come back. My bill (no alcohol) came out to be $60 or 70 CAD. Not bad."}
{"text":"Beautifully prepared and great service. Very beautiful atmosphere. I thought the flavors left a lot to be desired and it is spendy. They were out of quite a few items. $12 for a port and soda. I would preferred a glass of wine but tried the suggestion of the waiter. My summary is that I've had much better $70 meals (one entree + a drink)."}
{"text":"I got the most sever food poisoning at this place, We contacted the restaurant in person and by email, they never got back to us! 
This place is supposed to be well known for their sea food and we all know food poisoning from sea food is very dangerous!"}
{"text":"Heard lots about this place through friends and I guess my expectations were too high. The food didn't quite do it for me. We had the oysters and the six course tasting menu. Seemed very bland, and the waiters didn't wait enough in between services to bring the next course. The kale with the mahi-mahi dish was extremely salted, so much my mouth was hurting all night and couldn't even eat the dessert. Good suggestion about the wine from the waitress though.

If you like Portuguese and seafood I suggest Ferreira Cafe instead."}
{"text":"Compared with other restaurants in town Helena is a good option.
Not as advertised as far as kitchen goes but nice setup and staff."}
{"text":"I was recommended this restaurant by a Portuguese lady living in Montreal, and decided to choose this place to host a business lunch. The menu had a selection of seafood - done the Portuguese way of course. Oh ... and cornish hen - if you're not into seafood.  

I eventually settled for the grilled seafood platter (grilled jumbo prawns, squid, octopus and scallop) which serves 2. Seafood was fresh, flavorful and lightly smoky - the way I like!  Portions were not too big - just right for a light lunch with some space left for dessert.

The restaurant's wine menu had a wide selection of exclusively Portuguese wine. The waiter explained that many of their wines are private imports.  Not knowing what to order, we asked for a red that's smooth and around $65 - and they brought out a bottle that turned out pretty good!

Overall I would say that the food is 4+ stars.  Service wise it's also around 4.  Waiters are generally cheery, prompt and attentive.  Being recently opened, the decor is new and tastefully done.

Just to point out that the seating is rather cramped.  Think the layout of the restaurant and tight space forces them to place tables relatively close together.  The heavy lunch crowd makes moving space all the more tight.  (I was so concerned I might knock down somebody's glass as I took off my winter jacket.)  Also, in our case, the table where we were seated had benches on both sides (not individual chairs).  So that was rather inconvenient for the one (yours truly) seated in the middle."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was not good at all at this place. Five of us went there and none of us was satisfied with the our experience. The waiter was rude, not a single smile. 
The lunch menu looked good but the waiter just kept recommending the more expensive $45 pre fixed menu. 
Four of us got the lunch menu. The soup was ok, but the main dish was horrible. The seafood was not fresh, the rice was really hard. None of us could finish it. 
The other guy got the steak, not good either. 

Anyways, wont ever go back again and will not recommend to any friend."}
{"text":"I organized a team dinner here and have to say that they did a fantastic job.

We were a group of 25, so we were able to take up the entire room in the back, which was nice.

We went with the basic group menu which comprised of 5 shared tapas starters, a main dish and shared tapas of dessert, wines by the bottle. It may not sound like much but it was a lot of food.

They were very accommodating to a couple of colleagues who were vegetarians and brought them their own set of tapas, which was nice.

Oh and the food was great!"}
{"text":"1963 Port, need I say more...Never tried a port so smooth but then again where can you find this experience... Helena

I was originally apprehensive about the suggestion, yet any concerns evaporated quickly as we tasted the menu.

Food is above par and the drink selection is impressive."}
{"text":"My experience in this Portuguese restaurant was very good, I went for lunch and had the Table d'hôte special which came with an entrée, main dish and a dessert. All three courses were good! . Service was courteous and quick. Price for the lunch table d'hôte meal: 22$."}
{"text":"Suis venue ici un samedi soir pendant l'événement MTL à table. 

Le restaurant est cozy, une table à deux était réservée pour moi et ma douce moitié. La décoration est sublime, simple et chic à la fois et qui rappelle que l'établissement est un resto portugais de haute gamme: mur jaune ocre,  photos de bateaux de pêche encadrés, énormes assiettes décoratives au mur, un filet tressé avec des coquillages, lumière tamisée et bruit de fond raisonnable. Très harmonieux! 

En entrée, j'ai choisi la pieuvre grillée, concassé de tomate et de pois chiches, sauce à l'encre de seiche--pois chiche. Cétait la première fois que je goûtais à de la pieuvre, mais ce ne sera pas la dernière! La pieuvre était légèrement caoutchouteuse mais tendre à la fois, l'accompagnement était excellent; le moelleux de la tomate mélangé au petit côté croquant des pois chiche, miam! Sans oublier la subtile sauce de seiche. Un savant mélange de textures, de couleurs et de goûts! La présentation était parfaite! Bravo! Je recommande chaudement cette entrée!

En plat principal, j'ai opté pour la morue charbonnière. Elle fondait en bouche tellement elle était tendre. Le petit croquant des légumes d'accompagnement formait un bel équilibre et la purée de pois chiche était goûteuse et c'est une belle alternative à la purée de pommes de terre! Encore là, une réussite! 

Le vin était un vin rouge portugais d'importation privée, un assemblage d'un cépage du pays et de syrah, assez satisfaisant. Rond en bouche et un peu boisé, sans exagération. 

Le dessert était une tarte à l'érable. Croustillante pâte sablée, garniture à l'érable, mais c'est la sauce au sucre à la crème à l'érable que j'ai le plus aimé! Belle décoration de graines de pommes grenade et noix caramélisées. 

Ai terminé par un vin dessert type muscadet, à l'arôme qui rappelait celui de la pêche et de l'abricot. Belle robe dorée. Servi bien frais et sucré en bouche. Rafraîchissant et une belle finale à ce repas mémorable. Par contre, je vous recommande le Messiah 1980, un excellent porto! Belle robe pâle, arôme de caramel et de fleurs, très subtil en bouche, sans arrière--goût! Un coup de coeur pour ma part. 

Le service était excellent et rapide, malgré l'achalandage. Les serveurs et serveuses sont jeunes, beaux et talentueux! Bravo! Helena était présente, elle travaille très fort avec son équipe et contrôle la qualité de chaque assiette qui sort des cuisines! Impressionnant! Longue vie à ce resto et mes félicitations au chef et à toute l'équipe. J'ai passé une excellente soirée et j'y retournerai sûrement!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it was delicious.  The table d'hôte was so reasonably priced for the quality of the food received. 

$24 including an entrée or salad, choice of several main course and a dessert.

The place was elegant and cozy, noise level is reasonable as you can hear each other talk even if it was quite busy. Service was very good and the waitress were dressed nicely. They all had the same red/classy dress so you can identify them rapidly.

Entrée: capacious d'escadron
Fish was very fresh and flavorful (I must say that the fish tasted like fish...compared to my recent experience at Park where the fish was tasteless and all tasted the same )

Main: casserole de riz aux tomates avec fruits de mer (6 mussels, 2 big shrimps & 2 baby calamari).
I really enjoyed this dish as the tomato sauce didn't overpower and complimented nicely the seafood. The rice was also cooked perfectly. I think the amount of seafood in this dish was very generous.

Dessert: carrot cake with carotene sorbet
The cake was moist and tasty. Although the sorbet tasted alright,  I was kind of weird to taste carrot in a sorbet. 

For a high end Portuguese seafood restaurant,  there lunch menu is priced very reasonably. You probably pay around the same price going to Cage Au Sport or Madison. This is definitely of better qualify.

Will be back for sure to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"An elegant but hip nouveau Portuguese restaurant, it's wonderful for the set lunch and the innovative small plates. The grilled octopus is world class, truly delicious. Excellent food, lovely Portuguese wines, chic and comfortable with a great staff. 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"Four star food. Three star price and 3 star service. Too much upselling. Grilled Octopus rocks but don't order too much..."}
{"text":"Just wow, food was amazing, absolutely challenged my taste pallets. Great scallops with foie gras, and the grilled morue melt in you mouth. Service is great and very professional definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This dining experience is haute Portuguese. The Portuguese wine list is overwhelming. Fortunately the sommelier came to our aid, opening two bottles of wine to taste before deciding.

Salads, charcuterie, poisson, beautifully prepared, delivered, or filleted table side.

Arrive early, take your time. Make this a slow food night. Order a bottle of wine and relax."}
{"text":"Great new place. I believe they've been open for six months.  I went here for a business dinner. The staff were very friendly and attractive as you'd expect from Montreal. 
We opt'd to let the Chef decide on the tapas for the table and we finished with fish to share.  Every plate was well presented and we enjoyed every one.
I would go back in heartbeat."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu! I've been a few times and I was never disapointed - I do remember being served a small tartar apetizer on a warm plate but I quickly forgived after tasting awesome fish as a main course. You can do \"a la carte\" or pick among the daily menu. I've done both and enjoyed both options a lot. My only advice would be to make sure you have enough time for lunch as you probably won't be out before 1:45 - 2 PM. Also, we really prefered being seated in the back rather than in the front windows, as these tables felt a little close for each other. You should go!"}
{"text":"I went here last night and di the tasting menu for $65. The dinner and wine where awesome and the service fantastic. My only concern is that when I asked about wine pairing in french, I was told that the waitress could include some wine in my $65 dollars. She began to give us a class at every course and this more then doubled our bill. I was served wines that were $18 for half a glass. I am not sure how that conversation happened, as I was pretty sure that is not the conversation we had. I ended up paying over $300 for two people for dinner. I was kind of shocked by the bill but it was for a birthday we were celebrating. 

Just make sure that you are clear on the bill before agreeing to anything. Otherwise the food, wine and service are great."}
{"text":"Super resto portugais! Je suis allée à ce resto dans le cadre d'un diner d'affaires alors je n'ai pas pris le temps de prendre des photos ou de noter le nom des vins, mais c'était excellent! En entrée, j'ai dégusté la soupe caldo verde, une soupe traditionnelle portugaise. Très bonne et goûteuse! Vraiment parfaite. Ensuite, j'ai goûté à la lotte avec la polenta croustillante, espuma de maïs et légumes verts. Les saveurs étaient riches et raffinées à la fois. Rien à redire! En dessert, un gâteau à la vanille et cacao avec un coulis au citron. Le coulis au citron n'avait pas été annoncé alors la saveur m'a surprise, mais le mix des saveurs était très intéressant! Le tout était accompagné d'un excellent vin blanc (suggéré par le serveur). Il y avait aussi de très bons petits pains à tremper dans une huile d'olive qui donnait envie d'en boire! Nous avions la formule en table d'hôte et il en coûtait seulement 24$ pour les 3 services. Le décor est très intéressant: c'est très bien décoré et raffiné, sans être clinquant ou intimidant. Je n'ai absolument rien à redire sur ce resto! J'ai adoré!!"}
{"text":"I came here two months ago and have been meaning to write this. Old Montreal has a few touristy places that really aren't worth the visit and this place is not one of them. To try them out on a budget.. Like I did, one should go at lunch and get their table d'hote. For about 25$, you get an appetizer, an entree, dessert and coffee. You're full at the end and you're full with really quality food. This resto specializes in seafood like it's sister resto on st-laurent and it did not disappoint. My entree was a piece of seabass-it was great and perfectly grilled. The skin was just crunchy and the meat perfectly tender, cooked and not dry. The side and presentation was equally delicious and beautiful to look at. It wasn't a huge piece of fish but for the price and location, I can't complain. Our appetizer was a super hearty and adequately sized caldo verde soup with chorizo, potatoes and cabbage. Out dessert was a fancy berry-crumble-cake pastry. I'm not that good with remembering pastry names. My husband had the coffee while I opted out but he assures me it came from a fancy machine with good beans. They also have unlimited bread (good bread) with really amazing olive oil. The entourage here is very business casual whereas we were just casual but service was still great. Would go again. Especially at lunch time!"}
{"text":"helena was wonderful from start to finish. we got the meat tasting menu which to our pleasant surprise, also included quite a variety of seafood dishes as well - the lamb is hands down the best thing on their menu. in addition, the ambiance was intimate and the staff was attentive throughout the meal, which made it an even more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Really nice food, good service. We went as a small group a few weeks ago. The food, particularly the seafood, was amazing. Great oysters, octopus, and others. Service was friendly and prompt. Recommended!"}
{"text":"My super corporate but super fun friend took me here for lunch last week and holy mole was it scrumptious! 

I had heard good things about this restaurant, but when I walked in, I kind of subconsciously lowered my expectations because the place just looked really squeaky clean and lawyerly inside. But man oh man was the food gooooooooood.

We had the tomato and goat cheese appetizer salad (perfectly ripe tomatoes, super soft cheese, and general deliciousness), the amazingly yummy asparagus, cheese, nut and prosciutto salad (or parma not sure 'cause I don't eat meat) appetizer, and a seafood dish for two that was smothered in buttery goodness and that made my knees buckle. 

We asked for a white wine suggestion (because I generally dislike sweet wine and go to great lengths to avoid it), and the waiter brought us something that was minerally and fresh just like I like it. 

The place is nice inside, but it has a bit of a fancy corporate vibe going on (think people in suits and older couples). But if you decide that you don't give a damn about picking up a bearded guy who looks like a Pinterest model and just want to make mouth love to some sweet seafood, then you have to try this place. 

Yaow!"}
{"text":"I decided to give restaurant Helena a try on Saturday, November 11th 2017 since they were participating in MTLàTABLE (the city's restaurant week) and had an interesting fixed-price table d'hôte menu at $41. 

Restaurant Helena sits inside an upscale historic building on rue McGill. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant are appealing.

The waiting staff, the bartender and servers were well attentioned.

The presentation of the food was in line with what would be expected from similar restaurants in Montreal.

HOWEVER, I have a hard time remembering if the food tasted anything since there was next to nothing on the plates. I had selected the catch of the day as my entree (halibut). The piece I was served had to be less than two ounces if not less. The serving size was inappropriate or perhaps appropriate for an anorexic person.

Bottom line: When I go to a restaurant, I go for the food. I left restaurant Helena hungry and felt like I had been ripped off. For those of you that decide to give restaurant Helena a try despite my warning, it is good to know that the Five Guys on the next block is open until 11PM."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and tasty food. Excellent and attentive service. However, not much for the vegetarian."}
{"text":"I've been there for lunch a couple of times and have never been disappointed. The food is delicious, the ambiance classy and joyful, and the staff is friendly. On my last visit, I had the lunch menu Table d'hôte, which consisted of a tasty Caldo Verde soup, my choice of halibut, and a dessert. Very satisfying on all fronts."}
{"text":"Restaurante Helena is a Portuguese style place located in old Montreal that opened at the end of June. I was looking for a nice restaurant to go enjoy a nice meal with a friend prior to the fireworks in the old port, so we gave it a shot. 

The menu is a combination of tapas style plates or classic entrees and mains. We chose to stick to the tapas options. First up, we had the cod croquettes with a piri piri aioli. Simple but perfectly done. The croquettes had a good crisp to them without the fish in the middle being overdone. The aioli was a great compliment with just the right level of spice without overpowering the fish.

Next up, clams with chorizo, corn and Sao Jorge cheese. A nice light dish where the extra elements didn't take anyway from the key ingredient here, the clams.

Following the clams, we got the tempura shrimp with bisque sauce following with the plat of grilled octopus, squid and chorizo. Both were very executed and delicious. The standouts of note here were the bisque sauce and the grilled squid. 

All in all, the food was wonderful and perfectly in keeping with what you would want looking for a good Portuguese meal. As with most tapas plates, you always wish you could have more on the plat, but that comes with the territory. The wine options were relatively plentiful - with the caveat that II don't know much about Portuguese wines. We asked our waiter for his opinion and the choices he made for us were wonderful.  I will note here however that it actually took our waiter about 45 minutes to actually come take our orders after bringing us our wine. Because of our discussion at the table, we didn't actually notice until about 30 minutes. Given we weren't really in a hurry, this didn't bother us in the least but I feel like I need to mention this anyway.

Helena was a pleasant discovery and given its proximity to old Montreal, another great option for people heading to the old port. Anyone looking for a good portuguese place would be wise to check it out.

Cheers!"}

enjoyed the Carpaccio de bacalhau, grilled octopus, braised pork cheeks, and particularly the grilled shrimp. the suckling pig confit with clams was very well prepared as was the specialty fish."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Formule à 22$ pour 3 plats. Très fin, bien exécuté, frais. L'aile de raie était parfaite, les accompagnements goûteux, le dessert excellent. Service impeccable. Vraiment super RQP."}
