{"text":"Great poutine, good burgers. Good prices. Easy to find.  The atmosphere is nice. So far my second favorite poutine. Open year round, which is a plus. Lunch only in the winter."}
{"text":"Super service, tous très poli et souriant. Ils ont accepté de nous servir même si le casse-croûte était fermé. J'ai adoré la poutine, frite maison cuite parfaitement, bonne sauce et fromage très généreux. Rien à redire, j'y retourne à coup sûr à ma prochaine visite dans la région."}
{"text":"We love this place! The place is a good old fashioned fast food restaurant which offer up some of the best hot dogs, hamburgers and poutine on the south shore! Fast, courteous service even during a busy lunch hour...we have been there numerous times over the past 15 years and they always are in a joyful mood and the food has always been fresh and tasty! 
Little hidden secrets; try their pizza....the crust and sauce easily out taste any pizza joint around!  An other really amazing meal is the bolognese sauce poutine! Wow! What a treat! Even their smoke meat sandwich is delicious! Last, try one of their daily fresh home made desert cakes! As good as mom's...no joke, I can not believe the care they take to serve up all these varieties of fast food considering this is supposed to be a hot dog and fry restaurant! 

If you plan on going during a hot summer noon, do not be turned off by the line up 'cause you are served up in a couple of minutes! 

Last, This is one of the only places where you can call 30min before to get your pizza cooked so when you arrive its steaming hot and ready to eat either as a take out or in the restaurant...

If you are looking for a quick fresh meal on a budget and have had your share of Mcdonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Mikes, Subways and all those traditional plastic food joints, try out this place and I am sure you will keep going back time after time! Enjoy your poutine :)"}
{"text":"Cute little old school classic fast-food place. You can't go wrong with 1-2 or more steamed all-dressed hot-dog with fries or the poutine! They have soft-serve ice cream and ice cream sandwiches as well. Straight forward menu that is very affordable! The staff is also super friendly and nice!"}
