{"text":"My sister and I had a 3-course dinner there on a Groupon deal. It may have been an off day for them, or maybe it was because we had the Groupon, but the food was disappointing. We both ordered mostly fish items from the menu, and found that most of the fish tasted and smelled less than fresh. The preparation was very good but you can't turn not-fresh fish into a fantastic meal. The ambiance is very nice. The service was just alright, almost impatient (again, maybe owing to the fact we had a Groupon!)."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant in Yorkville to take my hubby to for his Bday. I wanted something special but not super fancy and this seemed to fit the bill. I got the groupon coupon mentioned by several a the other reviews (2 apps, 2 entrées, 2 glasses of wine and a shared desert).   Starting off with the reservation. This was possibly the weak spot. I made the reservation online, but when I called to confirm the day before they couldn't seem to find it in the system. I spent about 10 min on the phone with them before they located it. I then received a call the next morning from them, I assume it was to confirm the reservation but the person who was calling wasn't sure what they were calling about. It was kind of odd.  So I was a little hesitant going in. I shouldn't have been. The service when we arrived was excellent. We were seated promptly and the had somewhere to hang our jackets. I love this! Probably my biggest pet peeve is when restaurant don't have somewhere to put your jacket, especially when there is bench seating, or your wearing a long coat, which when you hang on the back of a chair, touches the ground. This is Canada we wear jackets 6 months out of the year, I would think having a coat rack at the very least would be standard...but I digress :)   The décor was lovely, intimate with just the right amount of hustle and bustle, not too fancy but not 'trying to hard' either, the art work on the wall was interesting, the wine glasses huge, which I really like, and good lighting so you can actually see your food :) My husband even commented on the noise level. It was perfect, we could have a conversation easily across the table without having to shout at each other but weren't dining in silence.  Our waitress was excellent. Groupon coupons make me nervous as often you get shortchanged on the service, not in this case, she was friendly and knowledgeable. For dinner my husband had shrimps which were divine, and the swordfish which was also excellent. I had the shrimp, calamari and small tomatoes in a tomato sauce with little tiny bread rolls as the started which was also good, but not as good as the shrimp. My main was lamb, although cooked extremely well, it was not particularly flavourful. Our desert were these little french toast like things with Dolce de Leche ice cream, - OMG - it was amazing. We added to our Groupon and got a bottle of wine in addition to the 2 glasses, they had several BC wines on the menu which was really great to see as they are hard to find in Ontario.  On a whole a fantastic experience, I didn't feel at all as though we were short changed because we were using the Groupon which I think speaks volumes for the restaurant. The chef even came out into the dinning area to chat with people about their meals which was also really. I will definitely go back, and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried Dyne as part of the Groupon deal with hubby last week, and I'm pleased overall with the experience.  Venue The restaurant is in what looks like a converted large Victorian semi with seating downstairs, bar in the front and kitchen at the back.  There is an upstairs but we didn't check it out.  Ambiance is simple but sophisticated, with compact but comfortable seating.  Service We were there early for dinner and the staff were still setting up and preparing.  It didn't bother us, since we had the entire waitstaff to ourselves.  Good and friendly service, at least when it's not busy.  Food I originally purchased the Groupon because I wanted try the duck.  However, I was disappointed to find out that it was no longer on the menu.  I had the mussels and hubby had the lobster salad, and both were excellent!  The flavour were full and unique, generous portions as well.  Definitely a 5/5! I had the himachi main, which was substituted with Benito.  Fish was fresh good grade and cooked to perfection.  Presentation can be slightly improved.  Hubby had the Cornish hen, which I was told was pretty good.  Desert menu is pretty small for our usual taste.  I had the flan, which is nothing to rave about.  Hubby had the enseimata, which had great home made ice cream.  Would go back, but will probably try more starters and skip the main (unless they bring back the duck)."}
{"text":"I was here on a Groupon deal special that allowed me two apps, two mains, one dessert, two wine or substitute drink. When we were there it was a quiet weekday. The ambiance mood is a bit dark and intimate and they have main floor and up-stairs for special occasion. Anywho...On to the food!  Started with the Lobster cold plate that was cut into pieces mixed with avocado, papaya, macadamia nuts, and some refreshing citrus vinaigrette. This was good portion and very tasty.  Second app was the Cross Cut Short Ribs with rice. This can easily be a light meal, but was part of the apps section. The flavour was very nice and enjoyable. Again this was light for a meal, but great for apps.  Our Main was the Duck cooked perfectly at medium rare. I got the skirt steak which is flank steak for those that don't know, and it was DELIGHTFUL! Cooked well again. The desserts was a puff pastry of some sort which is alright.   Overall very good food here and I def see myself coming by here to get some good eating..."}
{"text":"We had a large party and sat upstairs. Great ambience. Staff were very good. The food was fantastic, we had the swordfish and the ribeye as mains. It's so rare you get a properly done swordfish. Would definitely return.   As a bonus I scored street parking"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I've had in Toronto over the past year! Food, ambiance, service -- all perfect. A rare gem!   I have no doubt this will become a neighbourhood staple like its neighbours Sotto Sotto and Scaramouche.   Went here with fellow diner on Saturday evening and had hesitations given that it is a brand new restaurant only had a handful of other patrons.   Our server was extremely friendly and sweet, attentive, and very helpful with the menu. We could not have been more content with our choices:   Starters: - lobster (9/10) - crudo (9/10)  Mains: - duck (9/10) - hamachi (10/10)  Dessert: - galado (9/10)  Beverage: - house red (8/10)  Definitely on the pricier side so it won't be a weekly venture, but worth it!  I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So I came back... It was a horrible experience. We ordered Tuna and Chickpeas and Lobster for starter, needless to say, it was awful from the start. The Tuna and Chickpeas, had no tuna, maybe the sauce had tuna pee, I'm not sure, and it tastes nothing spectacular. And the lobster, although it tastes good, there were only 4 very tiny pieces of lobster in the dish. The main dish we had lamb and swordfish. The Lamb was tasteless, like it was water boiled. And the swordfish, it was super salty as if the salt spilled everywhere. The desert, we wanted the cheese platter, but we had to add money to groupon for that.The restaurant was really dead, only two other people dinning besides us. House wines, also horrible."}
{"text":"4-1/2 stars  Let me start off by saying that I avoid dining in the Yorkville area code as a whole (save for Café Boulud @ the Four Seasons).  The restaurants are more about ambiance and being seen than it is for good food.  DYNE on Avenue came across my radar when I had heard about the over-the-top Chef's Last Meal; a 34 oz. ribeye with not one, but two lobes of foie gras, butter-poached lobster and all the fixings for $325 which owner and executive chef Richard Andino tells me has fed as little as two and as many as six.  The ambiance is relaxing, intimate and makes for a romantic date night.  Sink into a plush velvet banquette while admiring the details of the décor (my favourite being the mirror above the bar which reflects the window and patio) of DYNE. The background music features a great list of throwback tunes from the 70s to 90s that will have you bopping in your chair while being just the right volume to still carry on conversation.  The private dining room upstairs in this Victorian-house converted restaurant can host up to 46.  The menu divides appetizers into hot/cold and then leads into entrées listed by type of protein.  The food is spun-off from Portuguese and Spanish classics and often feature an infusion of Asian flavours. The wine list highlights Portugal/Spain but you will find a few Ontario wines as well.  The cocktail list makes it hard for one to decide which to get as they all sound delicious!  Andino, who is no stranger to the restaurant business (having started as a busser at the age of 19) and since worked his way up the ranks; all the way to executive chef at Mark McEwan's North 44.  In the kitchen is former Canoe sous-chef Julie Marteleira who shows that the kitchen is not just a man's world.  Drawing from her Portuguese roots, she wows me with Sardines, served with egg, cherry gastrique, Serrano ham and chili-garlic rice.  The combo sounds seemingly strange on paper but you won't need any convincing once you've tasted it.  The slight sweetness and tartness of the cherries works really well with the saltiness of the Serrano.  The sardines are seared to a golden brown and the words \"fishy\" don't even cross your mind.  The Pan Con Tomate is one of the best I've had as the freshness of the Heirloom tomatoes and simplicity of buttered bread served with thin slices of Serrano makes it hard to resist not filling up on carbs before the mains arrive.  The Smoked Oysters with chicarrón are served with pickled daikon and vinaigrette and the mesquite, tart and sweet elements come together really well.  For mains, the Angus Beef Ribeye with Asian chimichurri, scallions, Romesco, fingerlings, oyster mushrooms and sweet corn gives me a taste of what to expect when I return with my posse to experience the Chef's Last Meal (which I am now even more convinced to do).  The steak is seared to a perfect medium rare and the sweetness of the corn cuts some of the richness inherent in a steak.  On the lighter side of things, the Swordfish with bacon, pearl onions, parsley and egg which draw inspiration from traditional Spanish/Portuguese cod dishes.  The bacon added great flavour to the dish.  Desserts feature items such as Pastel de Huevo; a sponge cake topped with almond cream which is a light way to end the evening.  The only dilemma we have is trying to scrape off every bit of the sponge cake without eating the parchment paper that it so stubbornly clings to.   The Torrija is also a favourite of mine; caramelized brioche with whipped cream and sweet milk.  At first glance, they look like pan seared scallops which gives me an idea for my next April Fool's Day menu!  The dream team that sees Andino as entertaining host and Marteleira as tummy pleaser is definitely a win in my books.  If you want to experience full-flavoured food and have a good time, then DYNE is the place to go.  \"Ibericó ham is good, but when it costs $800 a leg and you have to charge for it...\" says Andino and when \"paying $40 for charcuterie and a glass of wine isn't Toronto,\" says Marteleira as we discuss why things like the famed Ibericó ham are not on the menu.    DYNE's philosophy is simply to cook good food and to make sure everyone has a good time.  At the end of our discussion we all agree - good food is good food.  You start with quality (not necessarily expensive) ingredients and it will do all the talking on the plate.  TIP: There is currently a great Groupon promotion going on - 2 can dine for $59.  Includes 2 glasses of house wine, 1 appetizer and 1 entrée per person and a shared dessert.  Click here to take advantage of this great deal! http://gr.pn/1arlvO4"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon to this place, so I didn't know what to expect. Upon arrive I was surprise with the nice stylish interior decoration giving the exterior was blend.  The Server were nice and service was good.  What we order: Applitizer CRUDO - Hamachi, tuna, pickled onion, pea shoots, black vinegar CROSS CUT RIBS - Grilled shortribs, kim chi  Main HAMACHI - candied lemon, king oyster + cloud ear fungus, Yukon chips CORNISH HEN - Fermented pepper, lemon, garlic  Dessert ENSEIMADA - Baked pastry, chocolate ice cream, peanuts, hazelnuts, dark sauce  The food was excellent from appetizers to dessert and the flavors was perfect balanced. I can't imagine a small place like this can have food comparable restaurants in Large Hotels.  Highly recommend to go. Perfect place for a date or any occasion."}
{"text":"party of 5 on a weekday. Made reservations and it was packed. We were able to get seats at the bar while we were waiting. The bartender was friendly and funny as we inquired about the restaurant and the menu. Turns out he was more than a bartender, he was the owner of Dyne. Outgoing and simple personality with hint of class, just like his restaurant portrayed.   My group used two groupon deals. Thank god we were able to use two of them with a group of 5. But honestly, wouldn't have mind paying full price since service and food was extraordinary. I was disappointed that they weren't serving mussels and  waffles that was listed on the menu and they were very apologetic. They gave us their business card and promised us that the next time we make reservations, we can preorder it.   I ordered the seared Tuna and i was amazed how it was plated. The chef was so nice, she came out to explain the dish because I was asking the server a lot of questions about the unique garnish. Ever saw transparent potato chips? cuz I haven't, mind blown.   Overall, service, price, quality and education= perfect!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, outstanding service. In the 3 months since my first visit to Dyne, the restaurant has really hit its stride. The food is on par with many of the top restaurants in the city, and we were treated like we were the most important people in the restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings - so we went on Valentine's day, which is never a good dining night -  Place was busy and we had the Prix Fixed (totally upset me to find out AFTER the fact that we could have ordered off the full menu).  Space is over styled - one too many accents - and I was very aware of the staff.  Slightly Gino / Woodbridge Vibe - and the crowd was high / low - but that is to be expected on Valentine's.  Not relaxed or confident - lots of watching the door, switching stations, with a hovering manager...made me fussy.  The food was creative and intellectual - probably a little contrived, but great flavours and  thoughtfully plated.    We wont go back - not really our speed, but I am interested to hear how others find it once it gets more of a groove - and I think it could work as a fun date spot."}
{"text":"I dined here a few nights ago, my first return visit since the establishment, formerly known as Malena, was sold.  First impression: the dining room has been given a light but very welcome makeover.  Great kitchen art on the walls and a bit brighter with more space between the tables.  Friendly welcome (which later turned into first rate service). We were a large party of ten, so this allowed us to sample a great variety of the small dishes that largely make up the menu (there are a few dinner size plates listed clearly in a separate column.  The highlights were a very succulent pork belly, crisp on the outside and just perfectly cooked; cross-cut ribs served with kim chee; calamari; and grilled sardines with iberico ham and cherries.  There is a fusion dynamic at play -- at the waitress, the very talented Leah, explained the chef is Portuguese and the sous chef is Fillipino. There was one dish that fell a bit short -- paparadelle with sausage suffered from two problems, the pasta was a wee bit overcooked and the sauce so spicy that it overwhelmed what should have been a delicate melange of flavours (and let me note that I am a big fan of piquante food; this was just poorly thought through). On the whole though the food we tried gets top marks and we had a splendid time. The wine list was accessible (price wise), we had both an Okanagon Pinot and a very pleasant Portuguese red (the lowest priced bottle on the list). Certainly will return."}
{"text":"Went here on a travelzoo voucher which was a pretty good deal considering it offers 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a shared dessert. The service was polite and friendly. The food on the other hand was nothing to write home about. I think the surrounding tables were here on a groupon as well.   Appetizers  * Cross cut ribs with kimchi - Well seasoned but did not get what the rice was doing on the plate. I can understand the logic behind serving rice if there is a curry to go with it.  * Papardelle with veal,chicken and thai chili - This is a super spicy dish although our server had warned us upfront. The flavors were awesome but after a few bites the only thing we were getting was the heat. They really overindexed on the thai chilis that spoils the overall satisfaction of this dish.  * Halibut - Bland and boring, sent it back to the kitchen. We don't like strong smoky flavors.  * cornish hen - We enjoyed this dish since it packed a lot of flavors but we felt that our meat was charred and we could get a strong unpleasant taste in a few bites.  * Skirt steak with chimichurri - Very ordinary dish. I could not finish it all.  Dessert * Cashew gelado with shaved pineapple - This was the saving grace for the evening. The cashews in the ice cream were crunchy and interestingly enough paired very well with the shaved pineapple.   Verdict - I would not go here and spend money for what it's worth. It's ok if you have a groupon or other voucher"}
{"text":"I became aware of this place through my Groupon App.; after checking their menu online, I bought the Groupon because they served egg yolk raviolo.  However, being the short attention spanned pig that I am, I kind of forgot about it.  I stumbled across it on my phone today; so I decided to give it a try.   Sadly, the raviolo is no longer on the menu, so here is what we ordered:  crudo, lobster salad, hamachi, halibut, and gelado.  The appetizers were good but oily.  The lobster salad had great flavours and the macadamia nuts were a pleasant touch but the overall texture was slightly mushy.  The hamachi and tuna had too much oily dressing while the pea shoots on the side were tough and the stems were hard to chew.  Even with the small missteps, I thought we were off to a good start.  Even though we got two fish mains, the tastes could not be more different.  The halibut had a tomato/olive sauce which was very refreshing but the fish itself was overcooked.  The hamachi was buttery and fishy (in a good way) but the real star of the dish for me was the charred corn garnish.  It was so sweet and had the \"prefectly grilled\" flavour -- I could eat that corn all day long.  We originally wanted to have the eclair for dessert but it was not setting properly due to the humidity of the weather.  We changed to the cashew gelato which was rich and satisfying.    The food was great (with the few misses) but nothing hard to find in the Yorkville area.  The restaurant itself had an intimate atmosphere and the couches were really comfy.  One major issue I had at Dyne was the plating; both the crudo and the hamachi main basically looked like the leftovers in a dumpster after waste management has come but didn't get everything with the forklift.  Even the ice cream looked a little bit like a cake of mud with some awkward bits and pieces on top.  The only dish with good visual presentation was the halibut.  I would like Dyne if I prefer a quiet and relaxing environment with food that's \"easy to like\" and nothing too out of the ordinary.  All in all, Dyne was not bad, but I wasn't impressed either."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on a friday night at 8pm for 2. Surprisingly this restaurant was not packed. Upon our arrival there were 3 other tables at the time - didn't get to go upstairs but it seems like there was a private event/party going on.   So to start off - the atmosphere (4.5) - more casual than the other Yorkville restaurants and the lighting wasn't too dark either (ooo so I can take perfect food picture so to share here with you guys?!)   We ordered 2 hot appetizers, the cross cut ribs and calamari with calamansi aioli and pepper chilli. The cross cut ribs came with kimchi and rice that I would give maybe a 3 - though with huge portion, it failed to surprise it beyond its presentation. The rice was really dry and the rib was not so flavourful, kimchi was way too sour. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this dish. BUT the calamari was amazing though - perfectly cooked with nice presentation - the black calamansi aioli + pepper chili sauce was my favourite.   For main I ordered the albacore tuna with kale and oyster mushrooms - I was very surprised by the potato chip that it came with. It's CLEAR color - and super crunchy that gives this dish an interesting character. The tuna itself did not impress me though - it seems a little bit tasteless. My boyfriend ordered the lamb shank and WE absolutely loved it - as you know, I had been digging into his plate to try to get a piece of his lamb!   For dessert - we ordered the torrija with cream brulee ice cream and sweet milk whip cream. My boyfriend really liked it even though he's not a big fan of dessert!   We also ordered their special drink the French sweet sparkling and their house white+red wine.    OVERALL - 4 stars. Would come back but sometimes it's hit and miss with their appetizers or main. Good luck!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary on a rainy Monday evening. The place was completely empty but that didn't matter. This place is only about 3 months old but wow, I was very impressed. First of all the decor is beautiful, with unique pieces everywhere but it's not overdone, simple yet sophisticated.  I probably had my favourite meal of 2013 here.  We had lobster salad and ribs for apps. Both were great but the lobster was amazing! For mains we had hamachi - which was so delicious and full of complicated flavours I closed my eyes when eating it; and we had steak, which was nicely flavoured but a bit too salty and I wish it was more well done as I like it.  One great thing that I really appreciated about Dyne is that they offer ethically sourced free range antibiotic free meats, which allowed for many options as I wouldn't touch meat otherwise.  Lastly, we had cassava cake with lemon sorbet. Both flavours worked so well together!   And of of course, our server was very nice and attentive.  Highly recommend trying out this place!"}
