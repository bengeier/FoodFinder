{"text":"While recently attending a concert across the street at Ontario Place i came across Acqua Dolce. The restaurant is located on the exhibition grounds and is right across the street from the lake. Wow what a gem!! My friend and i split a marguerita pizza and it was perfectly cooked. Nice and crispy with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Next came a plate of grilled veggies drizzled in lemon and olive oil. Very fresh and tasty. We finished off our meal with a caccio e pepe pasta that was one of the best sauces i have ever tasted. Bold flavours that left you wanting more! The service was good (they were understaffed that evening but our waitress Amanda managed well) and they had us in and out in time to make it to our concert. This was a great meal and i will for sure be back on the regular!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the staff are friendly. Be careful though. If you come on a game day they reduce their menu. I was less than impressed with the reduced menu and if we had time would have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came here before a show at CNE bandshell. Seems like they are short staffed. It took 20 min to get a drink. No salads on menu, I luckily got to speak to head chef, and she made a fine Arugula salad. Great Location if you are at the CNE.  Hopefully they staff up better."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful inside. The food is excellent. The service is great. It was a little hard to find at first. It should be very beautiful in the summer dinning outside too. We will come again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere inside with amazing it's quite the food was so tasty and delicious it was a feast for the eyes even before you eat it. The servers were very attentive to your every need as well."}
