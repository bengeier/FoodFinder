{"text":"Got some butter chicken and chill chicken from here and each time its been under cooked i don't know why i bothered coming back for the second time,they also have bad staff and when i came to pick up the food it was on the floor which was nasty and also recently one of my friends got food poisoning from here so NEVER COME HERE"}
{"text":"I'm not extremely adventurous when it comes to Indian food, but I crave it all of the time. I arrived about 40 minutes before closing time, and even then, there was a solid stream of customers who were ordering a variety of different items. Their selection of Indian sweets was impressive, too. The man behind the counter was very polite, helpful, and patient with me as I figured out my order. In the end, I got veggie samosas and an order of chicken tikki masala. It took about 15 minutes to receive my food. 

The samosas are quite big and stuffed with veggies and spices. They weren't too crispy, which was a slight bummer, but on the plus side, they were pretty spicy! I can handle spicy food, and these were definitely kickin' in a great way.
The chicken tikki masala was also quite good, though a little bit oily. Flavourful with chunks of veggies as well as a good portion of chicken.

I will definitely come here again in the future :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe Lovely Sweets and Restaurant only has a one-star rating! My experience here was pretty LOVELY tbh. 

I haven't had much of a take-out experience in Calgary--like legit takeout, this is not a dining restaurant. I walked in and ordered two entrees, naan and Indian sweets for about 25 bucks, and it was a 15 minutes wait. 

There is a really Toronto-y or New York-y vibe to Lovely's. And I really enjoyed that quiet hustle and bustle of it in the suburbs. Even though, it wasn't particularly busy when I was there, there was a steady stream of pickups and orders. The staff seemed really organized and the food was 'delivered' as promised. I got my dinner within the 15 minutes. 

So the only reason why I didn't give LS&R a full 5-star rating is that I found the food just a little under spiced. The fish pakora was superb though! The Mutter Paneer was good, but it needed something. And the butter naan and the sweets!! My gosh, heavenly! I am a sucker, for butter and for sweets-- totally weird, I know. 

Get the fish pakoras, butter naan and chocolate & milk bhafi (Indian sweets), so friggin good!"}
