{"text":"Very nice independent coffee shop with good coffee (especially their single origin) and very good in-house baked goods.  Nice place to work from for a few hours as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only is it different from the Starbucks of the world because it is local, great decor, local art on the walls (I could keep going), but it is really, REALLY good! I hate only having soy milk as a dairy alternative other coffee shops. Echo has many more - almond milk is my favorite. Pastries are delicious too! Haven't had any salads or sandwiches yet, but that is my next on my list."}
{"text":"Went to Echo coffee for the first time today on the recommendation of a friend. The service was good, the coffee tasted good. However when I went to the ladies bathroom I was so disgusted by the filthy bathroom that I will not be going back for second time. If I'm going to spend $3.00 or more on a cup of coffee, I will go somewhere where the bathroom doesn't look like a dirty highway service station bathroom."}
{"text":"For being a local business that just recently opened, Echo Coffee is doing a phenomenal job. I have had nothing but great experiences (and none of the snafus that tend to plague small businesses when they first open). 

First, their space is fantastic. It is a clean, open and very modern buildout that manages to feel warm and inviting. The service is prompt, efficient and professional. And finally, the coffee is excellent; each drink has been consistent in flavor and quality. For a nice vacation from daily life, step into Echo Coffee with a book."}
{"text":"Echo is a nice little shop that i frequent from time to time when i'm in that neck of the woods. FIrst time i checked in it was too hot for coffee and ordered iced tea. Awesome Iced Tea! Vibe is great and i have been comfortable every visit. My only issue with Echo is that i just don't enjoy their coffee that much. Have tried multiple times hoping that it was just a fluke, but 2 days ago got the worst one yet. Sadly, that will be the last time i try ordering coffee. 
I will visit Echo again (iced tea only) and like i said i enjoy the place overall, but wish the coffee was better."}
{"text":"Great coffee!!!!!! went before going out to dinner and almost miss our reservation time because we were enjoying ourselves so much. The coffee is smooth....no bitter taste here. The little butter cookies are to die for : ) .Planning on visiting again this morning."}
{"text":"I am digging Echo...delicious Espresso and free wifi!"}
{"text":"Checked it out with a friend. Nice quite place. Super fast wifi. Cool front staff. Great coffee. It's pretty big in there and they have couches in the back. Great selection of music to go with everything."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! I was waiting for a movie at Camelview with a friend and we wanted a place to hang out for a while, so I found this place on Yelp about a week after it had opened. I am personally a sucker for fancy designs in my latte foam, but the coffee at Echo is delicious as well as pretty. Even better is the ambience. The music is perfect-- mellow indie tunes at just the right volume for studying or socializing (so many coffee shops don't get this right!). The staff were all very friendly and my barista was eager to help me select the perfect drink. Anyway, if I lived closer I'm sure I would patronize this place at least a few times a week. As it is, I try to stop by whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoy this little coffee shop right across the street from our house. My husband and I come here (almost daily) for our coffee fix. We like the seating, staff, El Salvador espresso and last but not least Steve! Steve Belt (owner) is such a great guy, very accommodating with our monthly PR meeting/group as well.

If you need a quick coffee fix or a place to work (free wifi), try this place! Quality service and drinks!"}
{"text":"This is a great local coffee shop to spend the day doing work or homework & fast wifi. Nice section of couches if you want to just relax. Drip coffee & espresso are excellent. Pastries are pretty good, wish they had some more food options. Great atmosphere & friendly baristas to chat with especially the tall lady..Gabby? Can't remember her name but she's helpful & sweet. It's also very clean & modern. Music is always at appropriate level which is nice when you are trying to study or work."}
{"text":"Tea is good, space is simple, food delicious, service friendly, wifi reliable"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop featuring:

- tasty espresso - beans roasted on site
- ample parking
- ample seating, indoor and out
- free wifi - password 'titusblend'
- good music, and not so loud it keeps you from concentrating
- friendly staff
- open until 10
- food menu but sandwiches only served until 3 - after that it's pastries, cookies, etc.  (also a pizza place a few doors away.)
- not all tables have access to electric
- no live entertainment that I've seen, though they have held a barista contest and another event featuring Walter, the world's largest VW bus."}
{"text":"Really great coffee!! They have almond milk for my mocha which is a gigantic bonus! Wish the seating was a bit more comfy."}
{"text":"Good studying atmosphere, comfy couches, and equally amazing coffee. They have plenty of seating available if you need a place to work or study. Inviting atmosphere and all around relaxing. The indie/acoustic music fits the atmosphere and adds additional character."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I'm [mostly] able to overlook the snobby attitude of the employees."}
{"text":"I've been sniffing around echo for awhile, have had some good (mostly in the evening) experiences but mostly bad vibes. Morning staff, (2 girls usually) makes one want to smash their head on a tree rather than try to communicate with either of them. Feels like a half-assed organic coffee shop. It's 2017, all milk and alternatives can be 100% organic, especially since they \"claim\" organic. Truth forever."}
{"text":"I visited Echo for the first time today. I liked it. The interior looks a lot like a big name coffee chain (which shall remain nameless) but is nicer. Echo has a variety of seating (chairs, tables, couches, benches, patio, etc.) and is more roomy than the \"nameless\" chain. I ate a very tasty chocolate chip scone with my espresso. I seldom eat scones or drink espresso, but both were excellent - the espresso in particluar, which was very strong and quite freshly ground. I would definitely return if in the neighborhood, but would be more likely to order the chai, as I vastly prefer tea over coffee. Staff was very pleasant and the shop was clean. Would have given 4.5 stars if that was an option. Recommended for anyone who would like to break through the corporate rut; Echo has all the quality of same, with none of the socioeconomic baggage."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good service, good atmosphere.  But the internet service sucks...you get bounced off all the time.  Also, the men's room is disgusting.  I don't think it's been cleaned in months and smells like a nasty back ally.  The urinal is out of order and has been for months.   I suspect the lack of cleanliness extends to behind the counter and the kitchen.  These are management issues, not staff issues.  Whoever runs this place ought to be replaced."}
{"text":"I come in here from time to time to get a fresh cup of coffee. I love that the staff knows everything that they are serving and where it is from. I just find that the place is a little quite from time to time. Some music on the patio would be great. But that is my little gripe for this place otherwise it is perfect in every other way."}
{"text":"Have happened upon this place a few times while on bike rides with friends. Always enjoy the atmosphere, the staff and the DELICIOUS food. Was excited to find a local coffee shop;  as we are always looking for alternatives.

Would suggest for a great date night, a place to stop for a quick cup, or a relaxing night of conversation."}
{"text":"This place is great! I am big on customer service especially in places like Scottsdale where I have heard not a lot of good things. But this place is far from those negative comments! The morning staff is friendly and the customer service is excellent! The coffee shop is laid back; music is not too loud; noise level is moderate; and their wide windows create an open atmosphere. It's a great a great place for studying, catching up with friends, small meetings, and internet surfing. Unlike those other dark dim loud coffee shops. Echo coffee is a great place with great staff and great tasting coffee and espressos. Come see for your self."}
{"text":"Most amazing coffee. Steve the owner is very knowledgable in all things coffee and it shows in every cup of coffee. I love a cappuccino, an almond milk latte or a glass of their cold brew. They also have great pastries, my favorite is the blueberry muffin."}
{"text":"Awkward vibe! Not to friendly customer service either. I waited 10 minutes for just a regular coffee. It's like all the staff had no communication. Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"My second office!! Great place to get some work done and their coffee is amazing!! Specially cappuccino."}
{"text":"So here is the deal with Echo,
Their coffee is great. However the baked goods are sparse and very overpriced just like the whole beans that he sales. Point is that yes, there are much superior beans offered here in AZ. My two favorites are Single Speed Roasters and  Cortez Coffee , Cartel is awesome As well. The best part is they don't overcharge! Look, I love my whole beans from local roaster. I even buy beans from roasters in CA. When on surfing trips.  Sorry to say the vibe can suck like most of the so called art on the wall. But, for a good cap and a random overpriced treat it fits the bill. FYI: don't bother asking the owner for much in the way of info. He thinks his place is a God send to us local coffee and treat lovers, however he misses the big picture of what it takes to be a true mecca for those who seek quality, flavor and culture all in the name of coffee. Perhaps a bit of focus on the culture that is catered to would render a \"For Profit\" establishment rather than scratching at the surface of identity and success."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are really, really good. Sometimes I find myself in a coffee shop or lunch place that has a  salads/sandwich/soup based menu and find myself trying to figure out why more places don't try to be a little more original in their offerings. Echo Coffee has a couple great cold sandwiches and a couple great hot ones, and their pastries are all good too. Their lattes are smooth and perfect and float down your throat at just the right temperature. These people take coffee seriously and clearly love what they do, and it shows."}
{"text":"I got a latte...SUPER strong, but it was good. The employees were nice and quick witted. Really quick service and pretty comfortable setting."}
{"text":"In the midst of the ubiquitousness of a Starbucks in every corner , it's nice that we do have coffee shops in our city with good coffee, a nice place to hang out with friends or alone with a book or laptop.It has both indoor and outdoor seating . Food selection could've been bigger. Still, all said and done ,  I hope we had more places like this in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great coffee, terrible music..and it would be nice if they charged less for refills, like every single other coffee shop in town does."}
{"text":"Echo is a very friendly and relaxing place.  The staff is very helpful and both the food and coffee are excellent.  I strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"plenty of potential, but untrained staff on bar delivering sub-par quality. 
the roast looked good in the hopper and a Dietrich sitting in the back of the shop looked at up to deliver an excellent experience. we ordered a shot, cappuccino and a pourover. the shot was unpalatable; very over extracted and ashy, the same with the cap but buried in milk, and the poor over (auto correct knows what's up) was so under extracted it barely looked like dirty water, nevermind the taste. We returned the drinks and asked for them to be corrected, but a quick conversation with the batista made it clear she isn't being equipped to understand and deliver specialty coffee. disappointed."}
{"text":"Want to wait 30 minutes for a latte? Then this is your spot. One guy working and he was the slowest barista I've ever seen. I would've cancelled our order and left but my bf is a coffee addict so we waited. And waited. Nice atmosphere but not the greatest service. This is my first time here and based on the snail like service, I would not come back. 1 person working on a Sunday afternoon? Not sure what they were thinking"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE THE FACT THAT ECHO HAS GREAT TASTING ESPRESSO'S AND THAT THE BEANS AND MILK OPTIONS ARE ALL ORGANIC!!!  BEANS - FAIR TRADE.
HARD TO FIND COFFEE/FOOD BUSINESSES THAT \"GET\" HOW IMPORTANT \"ORGANIC\" IS - with respect to flavor, health, the environment, etc...
COOL - they roast their own beans at the back of store - super fresh.
COOL - their baker makes awesome treats though, the gluten-free options are sparse (2 granola bar items).
COOL - location central.
COOL - very friendly & knowledgeable staff

NEW EXPERIENCE - barista \"Trevor\", I think that was his name, made an absolutely gorgeous latte art design - a swan with a heart face and swirling waters below - amazing!!!  Will try to post the photos later."}
{"text":"This is where I go to study or use the wifi. The music is not super loud and every one seems really chill. I'm not a huge coffee drinker. I usually just get an iced tea, but it's good. I come here like every other week or once a week to get stuff done!"}
{"text":"This coffee spot is really close to where I live and I only stop here when I am pressed for time or don't feel like driving to places that I prefer. 

The coffee is decent and their menu is simple. Sometimes the latte will be too milky and the coffee flavor does not shine through, but the buzz is strong enough. If you order your drink to stay they give you a little short bread that is nice and buttery. They also have a clean food selection and multiple baked items that are quite good. It does have a good atmosphere for studying as well and the music selection is usually decent. 

At this point you are probably wondering why three starts only? My biggest issue is with the service. The girls working the front are nothing but unfriendly. I often feel like I am a hassle and wonder why they appear to hate their job. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but I also wouldn't say to absolutely avoid Echo either."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop.  This place serves great coffee and food that is inviting for any person...meaning, you don't have to be a hipster to sit and enjoy a cup at this place.  Also the prices are much cheaper than the Starbucks down the road, and are of a much higher quality.  Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a place to study or grab a quick coffee on the go.  The lattes are great!"}
{"text":"My coffee was good but the attitudes from the baristas left a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe it's the hipster attitude but no hello, nothing...just a rude attitude overall. It was my first time coming here and I won't be back, I'd rather go somewhere where i didn't feel like I was putting someone out by ordering a coffee."}
{"text":"Second favorite coffee shop in the entire valley, and only second favorite because of the distance from my house. This is my go to spot for coffee when at my office. great prople, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really like to go to Echo Coffee. It is a great place to get your caffeine fix and work. I've never felt more productive!"}
{"text":"The espresso is the best I have found recently! I absolutely love the atmosphere and the baristas remember my order after only a few times of going there! They have great pricing and a bunch of different milk alternatives. I would highly recommend the americano and or latte with coconut milk."}
{"text":"Love this place. It has a cool coffee shop vibe, plenty of tables, comfy couches and chairs and a bar kind of area.  They've always been super cool and friendly.  Also, they have lots of creamer options including soy, almond, and rice milk!

I've been there 5 times, usually stopping in on a weeknight after work, but once I stopped in mid-day during the week and the owner made it a point to say say Hello and ask how I found out about them.  He was very energetic, positive and seemed like the kind of person who really cares about his business and his customers."}
{"text":"Been to this place 3 times now. Today was the first time I tried their food. My order consisted of a skim latte and their Italian press sandwich. First the coffee, and i say coffee because the latte actually tasted like coffee. Unlike other coffee joints, ahem Starbucks, this actually tasted like their was more to this drink than sugar and milk. Solid drink. 

Second the sandwich. Wow. It was awesome. It had the perfect ratio of meat on it so it wasn't huge but still very filling. The bread was awesome, grilled and crispy but not rock hard like panani presses can sometimes cause. Overall I was very satisfied with it, I will be back to try some of their other sandwiches. The only reason I don't give this place a 5 star is the prices, its not cheap but then again like most yelpers I don't mind paying extra if it supports a local joint."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious coffee. I drink decaf and their slow drip process enhances the bold coffee flavors. Be patient as it wasn't immediate gratifications like other coffee shops."}
{"text":"Decent place with relaxing, quiet music and a nice calm vibe. The lighting is dim, which I actually really liked. We had some hibiscus herbal tea, and it was pretty tasty! Each drink comes with a little cookie, which is cool if you like free cookies. 

My brother asked if they had any yerba mate and the barista guy looked so confused. He did not seem knowledgeable regarding the menu. He was decently friendly I guess, but he seemed to have an indifferent attitude and was not terribly helpful.

The second time we ordered tea he asked my brother to bring up our ceramic mugs. I thought that was slightly odd. I figured he would just come and grab them, seeing as the cafe was not terribly busy. When he brought the second round of tea to our table, he seemed annoyed. 

Echo Coffee has potential for sure, but as others have stated PLEASE train your staff! I thought maybe I had come on an off day, but it seems like poor service is the norm. If there was a little more effort, eye contact, and smiling I would be far more likely to return! Nice, friendly, helpful staff would be a game-changer for Echo."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, great ambiance, excellent coffee.  They are open until 10pm, have WIFI and a lot of people.  I loved my mocha.  All their drinks are excellent. Great place to hang out on the weekends. Will be back!"}
{"text":"good coffee, fair prices, great studying ambience and an overall quiet, clean place. if you're trying to socialize, this might not be the best place but for studying, it's my first choice."}
{"text":"I really like this place overall but a couple of the baristas bother me enough that I avoid coming very often. (There is also a very sweet, cheerful girl who works hard and because of her I feel bad writing this review). One female barista has been repeatedly rude to me and to the people around me. She seems to be friendly only to male guests. Another female barista talks loudly and continually... to the point where I stopped trying to study in order to write this review. If these 2 employees (who seem to be there all the time) would improve their work ethic and awareness of their surroundings I would love Echo, because the coffee is great, the music is good, and there is usually plenty of seating. But in the end, I dont enjoy feeling uncomfortable and irritated in a place meant for enjoyment."}
{"text":"Nice place to work and hang.  Really great espresso drinks, although I don't like the pour-over as much as Cartel's.  Cartel's is less bitter and more floral tasting.  Their oatmeal cookies are good, but not a fan of their food as of late.  Not enough vegetarian or smaller options.  Soup, half-sandwich or half-salad would be nice.  Overpriced, too - a very limited, plain salad (Waldorf) for 7.50.  And that's one of the cheaper things.  No more Cuban sandwich, either.  And oddly enough, the sandwiches come with a little bucket of stale popcorn.  Tastes terrible, and in any case, does not go with coffee at all.  The chef can obviously do pastries - it would be great if he tried his hand at some savory muffins like they have in New Zealand coffee shops (sweet potato, cheese and spinach; bacon and cheese, etc.)."}
{"text":"Best iced latte I've ever had...even with almond milk, the espresso is smooth, sweet, low acidity! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I know for a fact that all pastries and food are made with all natural or organic ingredients and are made in house fresh every day.  as for the baristas they are all quite knowledgeable and professional in their craft. I love this place."}
{"text":"The cafe looks nice, and is comfortable for enjoying coffee and getting work done. The morning staff doesn't have much personality but the afternoon staff is really nice. The coffee is decent. I haven't tried many of the pastries, but the few I have tried don't have much flavor. No other food is offered here which is kind of a downer."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop! Fairly quiet with lots of tables and space for studying. There are also couches in the back to relax on."}
{"text":"Good coffee, stable internet - Nice staff though \"New age\" \"good energy\"  and astrology vibe and talk is staple of conversation. Several Power outlets."}
{"text":"The best coffee shop I've ever been to.... the coffee, the people and the atmosphere is great... Free wifi... great location... 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Always pleased, never disappointed!! Best chai and latte in town! And wonderful place to sit and visit, quaint and quiet. Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been making an effort to explore more coffee shops in the Tempe area to study. I found this place after a few study-friendly reviews.

The shop itself is pretty spacious, a good deal of tables, wifi, and a slew of couches to make yourself comfortable and grade papers, do homework, keep up with your wordpress/squarespace, etc. (Yeah, it's a hip place.) They also have a few art pieces from local artists which I appreciate.

I arrived on a Saturday afternoon and there weren't too many people inside. The baristas didn't greet customers, which I thought was a little weird. He just stared at me. It was a little awkward. We'll chalk it up to him being an introvert like me.

But sheesh was that latte good. The roast is impressive- not too acidic, and the temperature wasn't scalding hot. Some may argue that the price was a little steep for a latte, but I reason that it's because it's some primo roast. In addition they have a lot of non-dairy options which I loved. Soy milk, almond milk, even rice milk. 

All in all- good coffee, study-friendly. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Echo has always been my go-to for 2 things: coffee and a great study atmosphere. The coffee is such an awesome quality that I can taste it with every sip. I truly have never tried something I don't like - although I normally stick to lattes. As far as the atmosphere, the place gives off an incredible ambiance and makes me feel inclined to study. Although it's not always quiet, it somehow works so well for me. Maybe the coffee has a crazy ingredient ;). 

So why 4 stars? The staff. Don't get me wrong, they are barista wizards. They know how to make coffee and make it well. But, wow. Could they hate people more? They always give off a vibe that they 1) don't want to be there and 2) don't want you to be there either. I'm a regular enough to notice some do this more than others (there's a young, tall guy that is always super friendly!). 

Anyways- other than a lack of feeling genuine hospitality from some staff, you should go here. Everything else will outweigh that one negative. Cheers to good coffee."}
{"text":"Let's just say I've also had a few CAPPUCCINOS here at Echo, and if anyone thinks they could get a better one at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, they should probably go have their taste buds examined by a medical professional. Freshly roasted, quality beans, excellent customer service, award winning latte artistry and a high standard for craftsmanship and technique make Echo stand out amongst a sea of fast-food caliber shops in the valley. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf??? ... go back home and pop a K-Cup!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Echo Cofffee that hasn't already been said?  I am a  frequent customer and I feel like I leave one home and then walk into my other home.  I absolutely love lovE loVE lOVE LOVE Echo Coffee.  I have never had a bad experience here and the baristas are my favorite.  The owner, Steve, is my favorite.  And the fabulous customers that come in are my favorite.  I have met so many great people at Echo Coffee.  And oh their menu is grand!  The great thing is everyone that works here is highly knowledgable about their products. It is a great place to meet for business or with family and friends.  I cannot find one negative comment anywhere in me!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, service, amazing coffee... it's all there at Echo. 
I went around 2:30 and it wasn't too crowded, the noise level was low but enough that it was a good stimulating environment. The barista was super nice and friendly and great energy. I ordered a iced caramel latte and there was barely a wait. 

This was probably the best latte I ever had. And I'm usually not a latte person. But this latte was wonderful.

The atmosphere is great- there are fun places to sit ( everything from tables to couches and a patio). It has a very open feel to it, and there is cool art and books and what not. 

I cannot wait to go back again and try some more. I think I'll be a regular there from now on."}
{"text":"This place is probably my favorite coffee in AZ. The people working are very friendly and helpful. They have a nice food selection, not the best but nothing more than I expect. I would probably come more if they had breakfast sandwiches. Anyway, the place is great, the coffee fires you up as good coffee should and the people watching us above average being situated at the corner of Thomas and 68th. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place, namely their cinnamon-heavy chai lattes (which often come with cute latte art!).

Pros:
- Each drink comes with a tiny biscuit/rusk-like bite (yum...wish I could buy a few extra when I get my lattes)
- Wifi is good
- LATTE ART (sometimes)
- If dining/drinking in, they use real glass and drinkware. Beats recyclable stuff any day
- Moderately friendly staff

Cons (being nit-picky now)
- Very limited seating outdoors, even though IMO there is room for a few more tables
- Small parking lot, though I've never had an issue with finding a spot with waiting at max 1-2 minutes for someone to leave"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite coffee spot! Organic coffee with a wide variety of options to choose from. They also serve a few lunch items and baked goods, which are all great! The atmosphere is very relaxed even though the place is often packed. I'm not a coffee drinker per say, but I enjoy iced coffee. Everyone is super friendly working here. Service is quick and on point. There are times when they will now see me pulling up and have my order waiting for me. The brew of ice coffee is super strong and tastes so good I drink it plain and without additional flavoring or with a little Stevia and it's great! U cannot compare the quality of coffee to anywhere else especially their iced coffee brew. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys coffee."}
{"text":"Best latte ever. Very smooth! This place is right next to my hair salon. Love places that carry all the milk alternatives. Cute and good vibes. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"This week my quest for the perfect coffee shop experience took me to Echo. I like the trendy name, every time I told someone I was going there I felt very exclusive. I'm a dork. :)

  I like the big patio with with lots of big chairs. I walked in and was instantly in love. They have big metal shelves right when you walk in that have books on them. Not like lame books no one would ever want to read but actual, recent, best sellers books. The counter was nice n clean with melittas sitting there ready to brew. If you knew me you'd know that I am a sucker for alternate brewing methods and Melittas are some of my very favorite. 

The woman ordering when I walked in was geeking out over the coffee girl's awesome hair and I stood back, relaxed and listened. I'm always open to tips on hair color. The hipster poster child barista asked me if he could get something started for me with a nice, warm, welcoming smile. I ordered a cappuccino, warm, in a for here mug. In fact, the rave reviews of their cappuccinos are what brought me here in the first place. 

When I walked up to pay the girl asked if I'd worked in coffee. Busted. She said she could tell by the way I ordered my cup. I'll take it. 

Enough of the awesome people behind the counter. Let's talk about the cup. Beautiful latte art aside, the cappuccino was a little wetter than I like them to be. It didn't quite have the texture of melted ice cream like it should. Okay, I'm being picky. The cappuccino was great, the people were great. I'm not saying this is the end of my search but I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is so close to my place that I enjoy walking to it. They have great coffee and love how they make their drip coffee. They grind it for you and use the single use filters and individually make them per order. Their Chi is really good too! They are sustainable and use Eco friendly cups and if the order if for sit down they put their drink in glass tumblers. I love going to this place!"}
{"text":"I used to live near this coffee shop and would frequent it often! The coffee is always smooth and  when I order the almond milk lattes they are made to perfection! They have an amazing drip coffee & fantastic pastries. My favorite is the chocolate chip scone right when it's fresh out of the oven, since the chocolate is so warm. You won't be disappointed with their coffee. They also have some comfy couches in the back, so you can read or do some work on your laptop."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of both the drip coffee and the espresso at Echo.  The espresso drinks are truly a work of art and the little shortbread cookie they come with make it extra special.  They also have some great baked goods (morning glory, zucchini & blueberry, banana breads) and some fresh salads on the menu.  Oh, and their 'Best Darned Grilled Cheese' on sourdough is very, very yummy.

While I've been coming here periodically since they first opened over 3 years ago, the real reason I'm writing this review is because over the past three months or so, I've been spending a significant amount of time at Echo.  Because I was preparing for an upcoming professional exam, I was studying every evening from 7pm to 10pm after work and Echo was my go-to source of caffeine and free WiFi.  Over those three months, I can honestly say the staff was genuinely friendly every single visit and the coffee never failed me.  I feel very lucky to have a great local coffee shop like Echo near me and urge everyone to give it a try.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Echo coffee will forever hold my number one spot in the PHX area to get a coffee, and hang out... for an entire day. I'm not sure how I would have made it through ASU without it! The setting is small and quiet for the most part. The staff and patrons are great people - always willing to strike up a conversation during study breaks.

The coffee, drip or lattes, are amazing... and they also have the best dirty chai I've ever had! When you take your coffee in house, you get actual glassware, which is always a huge plus in my book! Then, when you are there for the long hall, they carry small bites and pastries. Just enough to get you through a few more assignments!"}
{"text":"Fantastic art, great coffee, nice chill atmosphere. The pastries and coffee are amazing ! Such a great authentic coiffed spot in this area. Great for socializing and studying"}
{"text":"My review is from January 2011, when I was working in Scottsdale (cannot believe I forgot to review). 

I had several great espressos and coffees at Echo Coffee.  The people  were very friendly and accommodating. Had a great time chatting with owner Steve about quality coffee and running a cafe.  Echo is a great space that feels very comfortable.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped in try Echo today on my way to work. The coffee was VERY good. I really enjoyed my iced latte. Had a great flavor and was very smooth. I do agree that it was a little pricey, but not so much more than other places. 

Atmosphere was okay. There are other coffee joints I'd rather \"hang\" in. The staff wasn't rude but wasn't friendly either.

I wasn't really blown away by Echo Coffee, but I could go back again."}
{"text":"Love Echo coffee, I head over here every morning at 6-7am. They open early and have great nooks for reading and hanging out. Good lighting, wonderful art work and the coffee's bar none. Really strong drip coffee or cold brew available , it's a \"Titus Blend\". Just made an awesome french press with the Titus Blend and am jamming out on la computadora at 4:10am Monday getting a ton of stuff done!
Thanks Echo you rock."}
{"text":"I.almost forgot about this little place until i just passed it the other day...this place is.fsbulous!! My dad would bring our office treats from here almost every week for months and they were addicting...the apricot and raspberry bars are to die for...they are chewy and buttery but not too sweet at all...the chocolate chip cookie is amazing!! i think its the zucchini bread but that is amazing its moist and the frosting is a perfect addition...i love this little place my sis and i used to go here last summer to.get their chai soy iced lattes and they were so good...its completely different then any other chai latte i have ever had...i do not think they add sugar to their chai which is a nice change...dont get me wrong i love my other chai lattes from other places too but this one just seems a little more refreshing and light.  I need to go.to this place.more.often.its not that far from my house or job either...i would recommend this place to everyone and i hope this place stays around for a long time...they offer wifi and its a lil hip place to go and get away for a bit or to get some work done! Try it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a coffee dranker but I do like their coffee out of all the places around the South Scottsdale area including cartel. The baked goods are also delicious. I really like the blue berry muffins."}
{"text":"First visit and I had a drip coffee and the tuna sandwich. Both were excellent. Sandwich though was borderline pricey @ $8.  Service was efficient and prompt. Ambiance was nothing special and had a very much starbucks feel. 

Overall impressions: not bad, not great"}
{"text":"This coffee shop rocks!!  I enjoy the rotating art, music, and staff just as much as the coffee itself. I have ordered the vanilla latte which comes out at the perfect drinking temperature and I'm a sucker for the foam art :) try their sweets too. They also can customize your teas from hot to iced."}
{"text":"Lived not too far from Echo Coffee. This place is really pretty and comfortable, several tables as well as a few chairs, love seats and sofas. What more could you ask for. Used to come here a on occasion. If I were passing by or if it was to late and I didn't feel like going to far from home. They have a good assortment of bakery items here, as well as sandwhiches and other food items. Big glass windows that look out onto the street and the other side looks onto the parking lot.  Echo is not so much about loud noise it's more of a place for quite contemplation or study. Not as hustle and bustle as some of the other cafes in the area. But that's just fine it's a really nice cafe. If you find your self in South Scottsdale or any where on East Thomas road. Skip Starbucks and pop into Echo Coffee, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and enjoy some good coffee or tea."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee drinks.  I got my mocha to go and they even took the time to make the cool foam design on it even though it was soon covered by the to-go top.  Very friendly staff and I was in and out in a flash.  What more could you want?

Try:
- Mocha"}
{"text":"I love echo coffee.  This is a great study spot with delicious lattes."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Echo. I tried for the last year that I've worked nearby, being that it's so close and not a chain. I don't like Starbucks because I drink my coffee black. I just can't find anything to like about Echo other than ONE of the staff members, the rest I have to greet myself when I walk in. I am first to say, \"hello, how are you\" and being in customer service my whole life... I don't think that's a lot for me to expect. But nope. Not even a smile. Nothing genuine. Ever. On top of that, the coffee inspires a sour face from me, regardless of how I switch it up. I tried getting one pump of chai for flavor as I usually get at other shops. (Yes their chai is a flavor pump, not real chai) and it was all at the bottom of my iced coffee. Never mixed.  Thanks guys. Glad I tip every time just to be treated like garbage and hate my coffee. I tried for a year and have decided it's worth it to go out of my way to another shop.  I give 2 stars simply for the quiet atmosphere. Although the couches are tearing and the bathroom is broken. :/"}
{"text":"So it's taken a few years for really good coffee places to get a foothold in Phoenix.  This is one of the best.  Great coffee - excellent cappuccinos and baristas that know the art of good coffee.  Also very good quality naked good.  Blueberry muffins are delish!"}
{"text":"Just got the cold brewed coffee, and carrot bread. Both are fantastic. Super friendly staff, and chill environment that is nice and quiet. Very nice coffee shop, first visit and not the last!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a raspberry danish and Latte while waiting for new tires to be installed at the nearby Advanced Auto Service and Tire center.

I didn't really know what to expect since this was my first visit.  I found the place to be a great place to hang out with a coffee while reading or surfing the web.  I found the latte to be very good and enjoyed every sip of it.  I will definitely be back to try some other coffee drinks and possibly try one of their food items."}
{"text":"Echo Coffee is hands down the finest coffee shop in the valley! Its absolutely my favorite for a number of reasons. Megan and Ayla are phenomenal baristas! Their award winning drip coffee is something special and their mochas and Americanos are to die for. The atmosphere is perfect for students & professionals as they have fast internet, great music (especially when Ayla is there) and great coffee. I can honestly say that Echo Coffee was apart of my recent completion of my MBA. Thanks Echo and thanks Ayla & Megan for being apart of my life."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the coffee. I love the fact that the owner and most of the baristas seem to have more than a touch of perfectionism running through their veins.

I'm just a skinny latte girl, and they not only don't mess it up here, they make it right.  I like the tiny shortbread cookie they give you (even though mine usually disappears), I like the fact that they brought in different types of milks, and I like that you get organic milk without paying extra.

I also like the fact that when sisters and I have kids in tow, we never seem to get any flak for it. From patrons or employees.

The only thing I would say is if the baristas make a mistake, don't get pissy with each other for bad communication.  Fix it.  They all seem like they could relax just a tad."}
{"text":"Better lattes than Lux or Cartel !!!! They have great loafs too -- especially like the blueberry one. Pecan pie was good as well. Ambiance was lacking but would choose their latte over the other cafes above."}
{"text":"Pretty decent coffee. Pleasant atmosphere, friendly baristas and a cool vibe make it a nice place to chill. The coffee wasn't exceptional per se, but it was pretty good, and Phoenix is rather lacking in good coffee. Would recommend if you frequent the area."}
{"text":"Echo Coffee house rocks.  This recently opened coffee house/restaurant is a real treat.  It has a friendly staff, lots of seating, good salads and sandwiches.  There is free WiFi, which is great.  They don't care how long you stay.  It's not in a strip mall, but a freestanding, beautifully designed building on the northwest corner of 68th Street and Thomas. In our part of town, there haven't been many choices, but with the opening of LoLo's and now Echo Coffee, we're on a roll."}
{"text":"So friendly! The employees here are great & always give excellent service. I found out Echo Coffee was opening in my neighborhood on twitter & facebook, so I followed the pre-opening progress & was excited to see it open.

The owner Steve is super nice, & always willing to listen to customer feedback. It has become a great place for me to get work done at and occasionally hang out with friends. Steve roasts the beans in the shop & is very serious about putting out a great product. I've noticed the staff gets better at making the drinks every time I go in there.

I'd love it if there were some surge strips to plug more computers into, but hopefully that will happen soon. Nice to have coffee that's 100% higher quality than the Starbucks we've been stuck with in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I always get the stag beans, today I decided to also get the titus beans!  I am very very happy.  Titus is AMAZING.  thank you"}
{"text":"Echo Coffeehouse is off of 68th Street and Thomas in a brand new building shell.  They did a great job with the TI's and are right across the street from TT's Roadhouse. 

My wife and I stop there because it is a convenient place to meet, always has parking and they do a great job with the coffee (I get Iced Coffee; she gets Tea or water) and an even better job on the sandwiches.  I recommend either the Tuna Sandwich (made of white beans/tuna/light olive oil on flat bread) or the Curry Chicken.  Both times we ate there the food was fresh, well made and well presented.  I recommend this place to anyone who likes well-made, light lunches with a good, cold coffee drink.  

What would give it FIVE stars would be for it to survive the summer and host live music and/or art stuff at night."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally stopped by Echo Coffee together last Saturday night after having dinner elsewhere.  It was slow and quiet, but that was just fine by us.  We went there to have a good cup of coffee and talk, and that's exactly what we got.

We arrived at around 8:30pm to find only one employee working the counter.  She was busy making another customer's coffee, and I'm pretty sure she expected us to place our order to her back.  I waited until she was ready for us, though, and she almost seemed annoyed that I did.  She was pleasant enough but not very friendly or conversational.  She just took our order and moved on.  I thought part of the charm of local businesses was that they care about your patronage and show it....  Nevertheless, the iced latte I had and the Americano my wife had were both very good.

I'd definitely visit Echo Coffee again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it, either."}
{"text":"First time at Echo today - stopped in and grabbed a Latte.  REALLY good espresso.  Nice staff.  A pretty serious crowd - almost full - and everyone either working or studying.  Super glad that everyone is hanging there, but it was a bit library like with everyone working away and virtually no conversations going on.  Anyway - great caffeine - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Okay I have found my new favorite \"home office!\"  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been to Echo several times in the past few weeks. The coffee is wonderful. I had one experience of the coffee simply not getting ready and finally checking and somebody had forgotten to make it, but in general it's been fine.
My biggest complaint is that the bathroom is really filthy. I mentioned it today when I was in there and got a pretty surly look from the young woman at the register, which was discouraging. Business owners should want their places to be clean. Of course, she is probably not the owner, but she needs to learn a little about customer service and at least pretend that she likes to make the customers happy. I'll be back next week, and hope that someone has gone after the dirty bathroom!"}
{"text":"A nice spot, modern decor, friendly staff, tasty house-made goodies, and a great latte...oh yes a parking lot too. Thankfully not a Starbucks clone."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've known Steve (the owner) for a few years and he's a great guy. 
Disclaimer: I'm also a coffee dork and even though I know Steve and he's a great guy I wouldn't pull punches if the place wasn't up to par!
Disclaimer: I think I'm addicted to disclaimers now...

This place has great coffee, a great space, and a great attitude. Steve roasts his own coffee and is very passionate about the quality of the beans he's producing. If you catch him there, ask him about it at your own risk. You will get a LOT of great info.

There is a lot of thought in their menu, though it may not be apparent at first. For example, there are no blended drinks (like Frappucinos) not because Steve is a coffee snob, but because the blenders make a lot of noise and he wants people to be able to relax and work without being disturbed. Their space is very flexible with several couches, tables, and chairs for a casual conversation or to get some work done.

The coffee menu is also fairly simple, encouraging discussion between employees and customers if there is something specific they want. The staff is very accommodating, and willing to help or explain.  They have a nice set of food menu items to accompany the drinking portion of things.  It's a very well rounded, very great addition to the local coffee scene!

Disclaimer: This is the last disclaimer."}
{"text":"Walked in around 730 pm on a Wednesday night.  Almost thought I stepped into a library.  Every person in the place had laptops open and was studying.  Kind of wierd.  Anyways, library or not, this place can make an espresso! Very good and served in a ceramic cup. Will definitely be back.  Maybe I will bring something to study"}
{"text":"I visited Echo Coffee even though it's far from my neighborhood because my friend Carylann is the chef.  So that's my full disclosure.

I ordinarily don't enjoy Scottsdale-I never feel dressed \"right\" and I hate navigated the parking downtown.  I don't venture into the city often, but I would definitely hang out here.  The shop is easy to find; it's on the corner of Thomas and 68th on the northwest corner.  The parking lot is plenty big.  When you enter the shop it's modern without feeling pretentious or too hipster-y. Ample seating and gorgeous lighting by way of large windows and light fixtures.

The coffee menu is straightforward and I like the way they prepare coffee.  It's unusual and feels true to the product.  They pour hot water into a coffee filter for each cup, and it pours through into the mug.  My friend Susan ordered a cappuccino which was appropriately sized.  Each beverage was served with a tiny shortbread cookie-nice touch and something I've never seen done in Phoenix in any coffee shop.

The food menu was small but had a nice variety of pastries, sandwiches, and quiches.  I tried a bacon/spinach quiche and it was delicious!  Carylann also brought us out a piece of coffee cake.  Drool. I am still thinking about driving back for seconds.  The top was crumbly and generous.  She told us a story about when she was a little girl, she'd always order coffee cake and wish it had the topping inside the cake as well.  So she included a topping layer on the inside of hers! Yum!"}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop that is much needed in the heart of the \"starbucks controlled area\" in old town. Each drink is made carefully with time put into it. Not a great place if you are in a rush for this reason. Nice decor throughout."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee experience.  It's so pleasing to find a go-to coffee joint in a new city.  I only visit Phoenix for work once in a while, but Echo will now be my place! 

They roast their own beans in-house, they grind only seconds before the brew, and they slow brew right in front of you.  They have a pastry chef as well!!  It was hard for me to resist the beautiful pastries and opt for a banana - alas, due to my random burst of willpower I cannot attest to the pastries.  I'll have some food next time around, and at that point I expect I'll boost my score from a 4 to a 5. 

They do have Wi-Fi - you get a code on your receipt which allows you access. 

It's an experience.  Go!"}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere, great coffee, and top notch friendly baristas. Great place to be productive!"}
{"text":"Coffee that is dripping right in front of your eyes was the highlight of this visit. The individually dripping coffee didn't taste much different than coffee from a pot, so despite the show I'm not sure what is the big draw with that item. Also snagged a fresh choc. chip scone and that had a few good bites. Barista was in a pretty grumpy mood, but everyone has a bad day or three. Good local coffee shop if you live in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered a large coffee in, not to go. Just more hot water is added to the large not more beans as I watched both sizes being made. Also sat there getting cold as they prepared coffees to go for others. This is the second day in a row it was bad coffee. Done with this echo coffee. Let me remind you that 50% of your states budget is dependent on tourism dollars.
Seems like to many people want to get rich quick with bad service and less quality."}
{"text":"I just got back from this place just now, Nov 21 at 3 PM.  I created a Yelp account just to review them I am so annoyed.  I initially went in this morning and got a coffee and a pear muffin.  I drank my coffee on the way to work, it was excellent.  I started to eat my muffin and noticed there was no pear taste.  Thinking maybe it was a muffin with pear compote in the middle, I sliced it in half.  No pear.  So basically it was a sugar muffin---obviously I opted to refrain from eating this.  No big deal, I'm not an irrational person, I realize things happen and people make mistakes.  But at $3 a pop, it wasn't cheap.  This place is very close to my house, so I decided to stop back on my way home and exchange the muffin for another one, NBD right?   I went to the front and explained that the pear muffin had no pear, and could I please exchange it for another one.  I received a skeptical \"ok\" and a dirty look from the barista.  No sorry or even a remote hint of understanding of any kind.  She then proceeded to give the other barista an incredulous look right in front of me.  I took my muffin, said thanks, and left.  To the owner of this establishment: you have great coffee (Seattle native), but you may want to coach the barista working 11/21 in the afternoon some basic customer service skills.  This is honestly one of the worst customer service interactions I've ever encountered, and I lived in Boston at one point.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Echo is a decent neighborhood spot with a few issues.  The positive things here are the pastries- which are always great. The coffee is good too, for the most point. Service is always friendly. 

The negatives include slow service (possibly understaffed?) and a weird seating area. I wish they could have a consultant come in and help them set up the place more efficiently. It's a large sized space that can seat 7 people for some reason. Also on the far side of the place are some sofas and love seats that look like someone has been murdered whilst sitting in them. They are seriously beat up and stained. I know it's no fun buying new furniture - but damn these are really in rough shape. 

So to recap- decent place but there are opportunities to improve."}
{"text":"Checked this place out finally. I am a fan. Guy roasting his own stuff is great. drip to order  is good. Chatty friendly non stuck up staff is excellent. 

I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a FIVE STAR review. Coming here for about a year. Customer service has NEVER been their strong suit, but the products themselves are always top quality, so I keep coming. 
Starting with yesterday, I came in and ordered a shot in my latte and did not receive one. No big deal. I also ordered one of their delicious slices of bread and it turned out they gave me the wrong one... Unfortunately, I discovered all of this after I got back into my car, on my way to work...
Well today I went in with the same orderand kindly let them know that there was no shot in my latte yesterday and the cashier kindly comp'd me for it (best customer service yet), while the barista (same from yesterday) gave me \"the stink eye\"! Surprised by his reaction, I forgot to say almond milk. So when the cashier told him, after he had already started making it with regular milk, he threw his head back and rolled his eyes!!!!! I could not believe it!!
Unfortunately, this is what has finally prompted me to write my review. 
I hope the hiring manager is able to read this and considers hiring a better staff. And then train them on proper customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome local spot without the hipster pretentious attitude. The beans are amazing - I usually keep their in house Titus beans stocked at my house. The baked goods are to die for and worth all the calories. They are usually piping hot and fresh, too. I usually go for the Americano with some added agave syrup and a hot scone. 

Only downside is one or two of the baristas can be a bit slow-mo but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We used to come to Echo because we thought the coffee was so good, smoothe and tasty. Today, we decided that none of the adjectives applied to the coffee we had today. The staff lacks any enthusiasm and pride and the place is so chopped up wth this station and another place for this  and yet another station with a frigerator ....Furniture is old and used to the point it should be replaced by IKEA . It's in need of help with products, staff and the interior. I doubt whether we will go back unless I see some raves about the basics of nice staff. Sorry, but you can't treat people with total
Lack of enthusiasm and expect us to return! I get better service at the  national chain!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's in my neighborhood, so I often stop in for a coffee or a chai tea. Echo serves the best chai tea, by far my favorite that I've found in scottsdale."}
{"text":"Open architecture which is nice. Pretty quiet setting. Quite a few people hanging out for the long term study session. 

I had coffee there with a friend and got a decaf pour over drip coffee and a gluten free chocolate chip peanut butter bar. 

The coffee was too acidic for me. I drank about 3/4 of the cup but by the time I got to that point, I was not enjoying the flavor.  The bar was very good."}
{"text":"Great cappuccinos and drinks and the best study environment. The staff are also very friendly. If you have alot of work and need a good place to focus then I deffentily recommend echo."}
{"text":"Wow, I cannot believe I have somehow missed a review of Echo Coffee when I have been telling everyone that I know about it!

I love that it is local.  I love that it is NOT bohemian (though I like those types of coffee shops too), meaning, it has a certain atmosphere of modernity and professionalism.  It is less frenzied than many other coffee shops I have frequented.  I love the food, and I think it is significant to note that they offer more than donuts and sweet rolls; the salads and sandwiches are great!  And ya gotta love it when they say, \"Please sit down, and we'll bring it to you when it's ready.\"  Yea!"}
{"text":"Coffee is always fresh. Sandwiches are great. Service is fast and the employees seem to be cheery and helpful.  I like this cafe. Try the turkey and brie."}
{"text":"This is a great location to grab a caffeine boost during the day or on the way to work. It's conveniently located if you're in the Old Town area and the service is quick. The coffee is pretty good too. Mine didn't have an overwhelming taste; it was pretty smooth and subtle. I ordered a flat white (my favorite - no, it's not an espresso or a no-foam latte) and they whipped it up without much hesitation. The only drawback of this establishment is that the seating is kind of awkward, crowded and uncomfortable. It is nice that they have some plush seating if you can snag some property lol"}
{"text":"Their coffee is to die for. It's fresh, smooth and their simple menu is lovely. Their handmade pastries are on point!! All of the breads- morning glory, blueberry cinnamon- and scones are so amazingly good. Their prices are fair and there is never a long wait. It's easy to find and open at the perfect times when you need and want coffee. I always get the iced mocha latte with almond milk and it's beautiful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome lattes, a wide array of seating, chill music, and free wifi what more can you ask for of a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Echo Coffee is rockin'!  I am in love with their coffee and espresso drinks.  

I have gone in several times a week since they opened and I see that Echo is getting more popular.  I usually run in for a to-go cup, but last weekend I met a girlfriend there and we visited for 2 hours.  They offer sofas and table with chairs, so it's quite comfortable to sit and talk or get some work done (with their FREE Wi-Fi).

The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I haven't tried any pastries yet - not because I haven't wanted to because they look delicious.  I had a small cookie on my latte saucer last weekend and it was delicious. 

Echo Coffee is proving to be a great little independent coffee shop.  Their beans are roasted on site and I can tell it's a labor of love for the owner."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a really yummy cup of coffee and do some work (free wifi & lots of tables). The interior reminds me of Starbucks, which is a compliment in my book. There are outdoor tables, indoor tables, bar stools, and sofa seating. The people working there are really nice and will bring your coffee to your table if you're staying. The thing I love most is the standard cup of joe is an amazing cup of freshly ground pour-over coffee and it is absolutely perfect. Smoky, thick, hot, and delicious. It's miles ahead of normal drip coffee. Thinking about it makes me want to drive over there for some."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee, decent atmosphere. Their furniture, however, was in need of a deep clean last time I was there... The couch in the back was incredibly dingy and dirty."}
{"text":"Love this place. Personally I like modern, contemporary styles of coffee shops. If you are looking for that atmosphere, you should try this amazing coffee place. People are super-friendly here, the latte tastes awesome.
Last sunday, I tried the drip coffee, the taste of heaven. 
The most important thing! good place to read and study. 

I have been trying so much to find the coffee shop like here, this place was the best ever for myself in scottsdale/tempe/phoenix area.

I will definitively return,, maybe on coming weekend?! :D"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I love coming here to study or read, they always have good music. The coffee is local and organic, and their latte art is so great! Food is delicious as well."}
{"text":"(Full disclosure: Proprietor Steve Belt is a friend of mine, but trust me, if he'd goofed this up, I'd say so...)

Here I sit, sucking up the free wifi at Scottsdale's newest independently owned coffee shop, Echo Coffee.

Over by the comfy couches and chairs, there's a coffee roaster cooking away as I type (TV is on the way). Steve is serious about his coffee and is watching over that thing like a mother hen. 

Some delightful looking fresh-baked cookies and pastries and a basket of fresh fruit are available if you're hungry. (Steve & company are fleshing out the menu).

The atmosphere is great, and there's been a steady stream of customers coming in.

Oh, and the coffee is spectacular. 

My only beef is it's not in Gilbert and closer to home. I could hang out in a place like this all day...."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and helped me choose a drink. I ended up ordering a latte. It was OK. Music is loud inside, outdoor seating is not ideal as it is located right on 68th st. Food looked tasty, I'll probably order a baked good if I come again."}
{"text":"1. Solid cappuccino. The other coffee drinks are probably just as good, but I haven't tried them so can't comment.
2. Great pastries. I've tried the vegan chocolate sandwich cookie (dark chocolate flavor), banana bread (yum), lemon loaf (more yum), chocolate chip cookie....all have been quickly and happily consumed.
3. Free wifi! And it works!
4. Nice baristas.
5. Decent number of outlets for charging your i-Things. 
6. Trendy atmosphere in unassuming strip mall in south Scottsdale.
7. Local shop!
8. They roast their own beans.

Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Espresso: Decent
Food: Oatmeal was good.  It was obviously microwaved - a little too much for my taste..
Vibe: Drive here and hang out. New.
WiFi: Yes - fast and free
Plugs: ?.
Soy Out?: No.
Score: Good study vibe"}
{"text":"Very nice and off the beaten path. Lots to read. Excellent coffee and the sweets are soooo good."}
{"text":"Love this place for pre-work coffee meetings! Echo has good coffee without hipster- or Scottsdale-brand pretensions. Also, decent parking if other businesses nearby aren't open yet."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and needed a good coffee. Thanks to Yelp members, Echo had great reviews. Their decaf espresso did NOT disappoint! Rather, it weilds a smooth buttery sweetness with a very satisfying aftertaste. They use single-origin Brazilian beans. It's safe to say that you will not find a better coffee without much effort.

We preferred to take our coffee out as the ambience didn't match our moods."}
{"text":"Echo is right around the corner from my house. I'm not a big coffee drinker so I stop in only a few times a month. 

The atmosphere is hipster chic like pretty much every other coffee place in the area. The staff is friendly and the service is usually pretty quick. I like supporting a local biz so I always prefer coming here over Starbucks. They make a bomb Chai Latte and I love they have almond milk as a diary substitute.

My only complaint is they only offer two sizes and the large isn't very big. Maybe it's the fat American in me but sometimes I want a monster sized coffee and can't get that here. 

Great coffee but gimme more!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife to meet up with a friend.

I walk in and think this place is pretty neat. It's  got a good feel to it and the barista was very nice. 

I had an Americano -- one of the best I've had in awhile. 

It's out of the way for me, but if I'm ever in the area I would totally go back!"}
{"text":"Too loud again!  Is like a disco in here.  Is this a nightclub?  Was having a relaxing time here until the music got loud.  I used to go here twice a week.  But haven't been back in months.  Just got too annoyed with not being able to hear myself think in there.  Great coffee.  Decent baked goods.  Once I saw the staff made themselves great looking sandwiches that they ate in front of me, so I asked to order one and was told I couldn't."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots.  Plenty of tables chairs and couches to work or relax at.  Good coffee (not the worlds best but still very good).   Their espresso drinks are pretty good too."}
{"text":"The location is convenient for me, but not only are their lattes delicious, the atmosphere is great, and the people are so friendly without being obnoxious."}
{"text":"A strong 4.5. (Yelp? Where are the halfsies?) 

I love this place. Great coffee, good food, great service all wrapped up in wifi and a super cool, large space - with parking!!!

There for a working lunch with my business partner, it was the ideal spot. We both had sandwiches. Partner had tuna, I had chicken pesto. I'd give mine a solid B (I'm pretty opinionated about my pesto...) - bread was fresh, chicken moist, red peppers were raw on a hot sandwich which would have been okay if they were thinly sliced. Pesto was plentiful but not quite spot on for me. I can't speak to the tuna - partner enjoyed it in its entirety. Brewed coffee was delish. Service, awesome. We both said we would come back. And bonus points to echo's owner who thanked us as we left. Ahhh the humanity."}
{"text":"They have the best iced tea and banana walnut bred. Definitely a cute and delicious place to try!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place which is close to my house I had to go check it out. Great atmosphere. Owner is very involved and seems as willing to talk to you as you are to him. Staff is upbeat and that's always a plus in my book. I'm not the biggest coffee drinker but I had a latte and it was excellent and last but not least if you can't stand Starbucks because it's too much of a coffee Walmart, this has everything you need (good lighting, free wifi,etc). 

Bonus: I got to bump into Yelp's own Gabi, Queen of the Phoenix coffee shops."}
{"text":"First time here and the service was speedy. The iced toddy in my humble opinion was of everage quality. It was very drinkable but nothing to throw a party over. The baked goods are very tasty however they don't seem to prewar their pastries which I've also had happen at other places (maybe it's a new thing) parking is limited. Multiple 30 minute only parking spots. The regular spots with no time limit seem to get taken up quickly by the other businesses and their patrons. If your coming here to work you may have to move your vehicle although I was not asked to. The staff is very friendly and they have very plush sofas that are super comfy (I suffer from spinal neuropathy) so the plush couches are a plus. I'm definitely going to be giving echo a couple more shots. Their price point was very nice. 3.50 for a large toddy. I'm used to 4.50.. they are equipped with out door seating and the WiFi is pretty rockin as well. They are also bicycle friendly. There's also a bike shop next door to them."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, good customer service,  and very laid back environment! This is a great place for those looking to relax or study over a great cup of coffee. My boyfriend and I went for the first time yesterday evening around 9:00pm. It wasn't very busy, but there was still a good amount of people considering it was 9:00. I ordered a Chai Tea latte and was very pleased with the quality! 
I definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Almond milk latte is my new favorite thing in the world. And this coffee shop is my new go-to for a spot to study. Good internet strength, comfortable inside and out for lounging, working or eating lunch, and for the most part friendly and nice people behind the counter. Mostly mellow indie music playing, but not so loud that you couldn't tune it out with headphones. My dogs love to hang out on the patio while I work, and the staff are great, when they're not super busy they bring the dogs water and my drink out to me. 

This place gives Cartel a run for their money with good drip as well as espresso drinks. Good roasted blends available to bring home, though Cartel might have better beans for home brewing. 

Also, if you're going to be posted up for a long time, Pizza Re is basically right next door, and you can grab a slice real quick and come back and get back to work. 

Did I mention great ambiance?"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a coffee break.  The drip coffee is uber fresh and delicious, the beans were smooth and not too acidic, we didn't need to add sugar or milk as the coffee was quite tasty nor too strong.  The atmosphere is laid back and if you need to get some work done and have a cup of joe then this should be a good spot for you."}
{"text":"The coffee ain't bad but the owner really rubbed me the wrong way. I ordered an iced Americano and wanted a bit of vanilla syrup in it. The owner then gave me a look and went on about taking away from the true coffee taste. It looks like I am not the only one who has experienced this either. I'll be back simply because the coffee was pretty good and I like supporting local but will avoid the owner for fear of getting an inferiority complex."}
{"text":"As a cafe and coffee lover, out of the many cafes I've tried in AZ this one is one of my favorites. The espresso is just right and every time I order its always satisfying."}
{"text":"I came here to try to get some work done one day because the hotel room was just starting to give me cabin fever. I am glad I found this place because they're open late, serve food, are friendly, have great wifi and plugs EVERYWHERE ... and make excellent coffee.

I admit the latte art wasn't blowing me away, but I like that they serve a little snack with your coffee like a lot of European coffee shops do. Their lattes are pretty smooth and for the most part good except the foam to coffee ratio was a little ridiculous. 

The cafe is dark, so if you come in the evening hours, just make sure your eyes can adjust to your bright screen and the dim-ness around you. They have indoor lighting but for some reason its super weak.

I like that the parking is easy, it is located near an intersection, on a major street, and there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available. Recommended for coffee snobs!"}
{"text":"Second time around, this place was much better. The latte I ordered was very smooth and tasty. I had a chocolate peanut butter bar and that was still just okay. Maybe I caught them on an off day the last time. Not great, but definitely good and I'd come back."}
{"text":"I don't normally give stars lower than 5, but this coffee shop doesn't deserve my 5. 

I've been driving past this coffee shop and have always been curious to see what they have in here. So yesterday, I finally got the chance to see what's up. 

They're open until 10pm everyday which I think is pretty cool because most of the coffee places around the Scottsdale area close up pretty early (I'm used to seeing coffee shops like Starbucks open for 24hours which is not a common thing here). So I come in, and Look at the interiors, I loved the paintings on the wall and how they decorated the place. The food server was nice, their coffee was good and their chocolate PECAN pie was bomb! HOWEVER, with the area in general, they have what looks like some kind of machine across the room which made the place look a little messy with some random ace hard ware bucket on top of the machine. AND, at the time of my visit, there was only one person working who was pretty much doing everything around from taking orders, making coffee, to cleaning up and bussing tables and serving. And I feel so bad because there were a decent amount of people last night and one of him. My 5 stars goes to the server and the food but the overall place doesn't deserve my 5 stars.

The coffee shop has the opportunity to be a much better coffee shop and I hope the owner sees it and do something about it."}
{"text":"I am in love with Echo Coffee. It's tucked away in an unassuming strip mall in Scottsdale that you likely wouldn't notice if you weren't looking for it, which adds to Echo's charm. The small coffee shop serves up delicious drinks and a great menu of lunchtime classics and snacks that are sure to please. 

I showed up for the first time on a day when the power had been out in the store for most of the morning. It had just come back on and the staff were friendly as can be. I must say, my favorite part was the soundtrack playing in the background, which featured some of the best mellow, coffee shop music I've experienced in town. It's a great place to meet a friend, study, or settle in on the comfy sofas with a good book and some comfort food. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here last week. It has a great atmosphere. The iced chai tea latte was delicious and my boyfriend really likes the espresso and drip"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time and the atmosphere was nice. The girl up front was friendly and this feels like a place you want to be. I asked the girls what she likes because I didn't know what to get and I basically ended up with a carmel latte. It was good but I've had better. I'd come here over Starbucks for sure and they have a gluten free BLT on the menu I'm dying to try. Really deserves 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. Some of the BEST drip coffee I've had. Their yogurt parfaits with fruit are also really fresh and delicious. I love that they're open till 10pm. Sometimes my fiance and I will stop in pretty late just to get some dessert. Great to have this place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"But far the best coffee in town. Pastries are always so yummy and fresh they can't be beat. I love the chai latte (I get mine with almond or Coco milk). My fave sweets are the brownies. They are decadent and rich bars of chocolate heaven. I can come here alone or to meet with friends or family.  Sometimes I come with my daughter for a treat. Check them out."}
{"text":"Close to the office. Way Cheaper than SBux!...

There have never been more than 2 people in line when I come in, so I am not sure how to rate the speed of service. The music playing in the background is nice. Oh, I almost forgot! The Best thing about Echo is that the 'ToGo' cups do not leak all over my work shirt!!!"}
{"text":"It's always nice to stumble across a locally owned coffeeshop, and this one is no exception. Not only that, but it's all organic, a place after my own Colorado hippie heart. And if that wasn't enough, they have cupcakes!

Their chai was delicious (although presweetened, so those of you who like to put in your own agave are out of luck), and my partner enjoyed her iced latte, saying it tasted fresh. The made-there coffee cake was incredibly messy, but also incredibly delicious.

I like the decor; great artwork, soothing colors, some chairs/tables and some comfy chairs, and great music that we really enjoyed. I love the easy to access free wireless as well. I can't stand places that charge at this point in my life. I'm no trendy college student.

Prices are good for drinks, but seem a little high for the food items, especially the wraps.  The owner was super nice, but didn't seem to \"get it\" when I spoke to him about gender neutral bathrooms, which are of importance to me, my partner, and queer friendly groups I would love to have meet here in the future.  I'm hoping he'll change the two single stall rooms to be gender neutral -- eliminate lines, and make everyone feel welcome.

I'll be back, for sure. I have to try the cupcakes!"}
{"text":"Fast and reliable WiFi, great coffee, comfortable chairs and tables.

This is my favorite coffee shop in the valley.

Love it."}
{"text":"Echo coffee is the best in Scottsdale! The atmosphere is great and the baristas are really nice. I like their scones a lot too! I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Quaint. Relaxed. Casual. I wish this review was for my dentist but it's not. Great place to chill with compadres, take in a book or do some computer work. Free WiFi so, \"WiFi\" not? See what I did there? Ahem. Personally, I recommend any of the iced beverages because they are tasty. The hot stuff is pretty freaking satisfying as well. Must stop in sometime. If I'm in there, you can make fun of my hair."}
{"text":"The third time was the charm! I am from Seattle and I admit, I am a coffee snob. I am always looking for the local coffee shop with a great latte (not Starbucks!). Being in the area for 3 days, I tried 3 local shops. This was by far the best! When ordering a coffee \"for here\" I expect it to be in a ceramic mug...this was! The latte was the right temperature and the foam was perfect....velvety, and most importantly, the flavor was great! They roast their own beans and even their decaf (which my husband had) was good. I like that they offer pour over coffee and a pots of French Press. The atmosphere was nice with abundant local art work on the walls. This should definitely be the local favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Scottsdale and have been working from home (which means out of coffee shops) the last couple of weeks--and have been pleasantly surprised by all the great indie options in Old Town (Sola, Winfield's). Echo is no exception.

Equally great atmosphere for doing work or just hanging out, Echo has the added bonus of a made-to-order lunch menu. To top it off, my americano came with a tiny little bite-sized sugar cookie, just enough to satisfy my afternoon sweets craving. I'm sold."}
{"text":"While spending the weekend in Scottsdale, we attempted to try as many coffee places as possible (at least until we were overloaded on caffeine - 5 doubles is pushing my limit in a 24 hour period....).

The store is very clean, new, and modern.  They've got a La Marzocco Linea and a serious group of grinders - Mazzer Robur, Elecktra Nina, and Two Compak K10s - they mean business. 

I had a double espresso - described as a Papua New Guinea single origin with citrus and berry flavors.  It was pulled more of a traditional volume at 2oz+, but I was getting a little sweetness with some earthy flavors.  They have a couple of espresso bean options, so trying others might have found one a little more to my liking. My dad had a latte, which was pretty good - maybe the coffee works better in milk.

The barista was friendly and open to talk about the coffee, which was nice.  They roast on site, which is a plus too.  The place has a lot of potential, so it will be interesting to see what they do in the future."}
{"text":"Just moved across the street and this place is a gem! I came in around 11:15am on a Tues and the place was full but not packed. They brew REAL COFFEE, the kind that you can drink black, no sugar. I got a simple drip, nothing added and it was very flavorful. I also found that they have a selection of gluten free baked goods, yayyy! I tried the peanut butter chocolate chip oat bar and it was delicious! They have a great selection of drinks and snacks, with healthy and organic choices. Cute spot, very friendly and personable staff. Rare to find a coffee spot like this in Scottsdale. Reminded me of a small town coffee shop in Colorado, so I will definitely be back again soon, probably tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Sweet little coffee shop, I had the BEST dirty chai tea, I've ever had. You know its good when your wife is drinking half of it! They must have some awesome WIFI, I was the only one without a laptop in here.  THUMBS UP!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee! The owner is super nice and the environment is great. Wish it was in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop.  They \"hand\" brew their coffee one cup at a time and the results are exceptional tasting coffee!   They make wonderful banana nut bread.  Free Wi-Fi and every friendly staff.  The place is very clean and large with comfortable tables and chairs (like what you find in a college library)."}
{"text":"I'm kinda hesitant to let the world know how great this spot is for fear that they might get too busy! Echo is one of the few coffee shops I can think of that has good coffee, good service, and isn't pretentious. I'll be back regularly."}
{"text":"Lots of study space and the coffee was great!   Recommend the french press... the carafe is enough to keep you going all night!!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the coffee is great and there are a few stellar baristas working here.  However, the majority of the workers here are just not coffee shop people. They are not friendly, they don't smile or say hello, or ask me what they can get started for me.  I walk up to the counter and they just look at me and wait for me to start talking.  I often don't feel welcomed and although the coffee is always good, I just don't enjoy my experience here and it is totally because of the employees."}
{"text":"Defiantly come here to eat! The Pecan Pie is the best I have ever had, and their peach almond muffin is to die for! Their zucchini bread is amazing also! Coffee and a perfect pairing of snacks available if you enjoy pastries. 

My go to is the black iced coffee. It's perfectly delicious."}
{"text":"Inefficient and my latte was all milk and what seemed like 1 shot of espresso. For a large that's entirely too little coffee. If you're looking to sit down and stay a while, this might be a good cafe to do so. If you are looking for a quick cup to go, you may want to look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service and an incredible green tea, unsweetened it's still sweet!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a total package. They have 1. GOOD COFFEE 2. Yummy treats 3. Stuff you can read for free 4. Comfy couches to sit you while you read your stuff for free 4. charging spots 5. Fast Wi-fi 6. Open quiet space and lots of windows! Well, that's only six..but I think you are convinced?

The coffee here is so flavorful and strong!The quality truly stands out compared to more mainstream coffee shops. It gets the job done!This place has a very homey feel and the quiet atmosphere is perfect for studying or just hanging out . Oh, and their pastries are delicious."}
{"text":"Coffee was warm, not hot like most coffee shops.  Taste was okay. Server had hubcaps in his ears~ but cool. Said he'd bring it to me. Then a girl yells out \"regular coffee\" and sat it on the counter. No room for cream.  So good place for stoners to hang out I guess. The place was clean.  Maybe just a bad day. How much trouble is a up of Joe....."}
{"text":"I had a cold brew with coconut milk and sugar free vanilla; it was okay, but the after taste of the sugar free vanilla was a bit much, so I swapped it out for just the cold brew and the coconut milk and all was well.

The ambiance here is chill, the wifi is strong, the place is clean and the staff is friendly. There is also a plentiful amount of sitting space and plug ins.

Overall, I prefer echo coffee to Starbucks, and it's a cool place to get some work done!"}
{"text":"This place takes a lot of care in their coffee. They roast the beans on site, drip the coffee before your eyes and have a wide selection of classic, high-quality espresso drinks. 

The decor is calming and cool with plenty of comfortable seating and ample wi-fi. I'm looking forward to several return visits."}
{"text":"The espresso drinks are decent...on the smoother side, but not my fave. The iced almond milk chai, however, is absolutely phenomenal! It's cinnamon-y and sweet and unique. I've had it with soy milk before (when I hadn't realized that they offered almond milk) and it was very good, but with almond milk it was even more delicious! It's definitely not syrupy sweet, it's just the perfect balance of sweet and spice. 

The atmosphere is pretty cool, with many different seating areas, though it was tough to find a seat when I went. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The coffee and pastries are amazing. They prepare lattes and macchiatos the original way without using sugary syrups to mask the flavor. Perfect Sunday homework spot."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week at the suggestion of the person I was meeting.  She got there early and had a salad before I arrived.  When I arrived she said it was not very good and didn't recommend the food so I just got iced tea and a muffin which was good.  My friend went up to get me a refill and told the person that her salad was not good.  His answer \"sorry\" and that was it.  He also told her he would have to charge her for another iced tea!  I've never been to a place where they don't give you free iced tea refills.  He had every opportunity to turn the situation around by offering my friend something else or a coupon for next time or not charging me for my tea - but he did none of that.  I wouldn't go back and neither would my friend."}
{"text":"I'm warning you. If, after I publish this review people start bombarding this cafe - thus making it impossible for me to enjoy it - you will be in big trouble. BIG TROUBLE!

Having relocated from the SF bay area, I miss the local coffee shops I used to frequent. However, curiosity brought me over and I have been happy to have found this little gem ever since.

Let's start with the coffee. My usual order is an iced latte (these days the weather just doesn't inspire me to try anything hot). The espresso is deliciously smooth and the milk just makes this creamy goodness one of the highlights of my day. (Note: I always order this with whole milk. Don't judge. I like a little junk in my trunk. Plus, I like seeing all the Scottsdale lululemon snobs gasp at my full fat drink. Alas, I digress....) A big plus is they offer drip coffee and French press coffee (things that are to me, very SF). The shop has a small coffee roaster, which tells me that this is why their coffee is so yummy.

During my first visit, I told the gal behind the counter that I just moved to the area and she was so nice - giving a newbie advice on how to handle this insane weather is always a big plus in my book! Since then, every counter person I've ever run in to has been quite nice.

Another thing I love is that the place is quiet enough so that I can get some good work done. Though it can get a little crowded at times, I've never had a problem getting a table. Yay!

So AZ is definitely not Cali. But I'm adjusting. For now, I'm just happy I found a decent coffee joint!"}
{"text":"Personable staff, great musical selections between 7am-12pm and 7pm-10pm, free wi-fi, and damn good drip. This place is sure to become a staple in anyone's weekly routine."}
{"text":"I love drip coffee, and I really do adore the atmosphere at Echo. The baristas are very friendly, and yesterday, I was able to enjoy outdoor seating before the Arizona heat blazes up in the next few months. Perfect time to catch some wind and get some work done. Be aware that there can be the occasional catty folks who don't know how to lower their vocal pitches, but all in all, that's not going to stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that this review is not from malice, but that Echo used to be one of my favorite places and I hope to see the level of care and customer service it one had - but if serious changes aren't made, I don't know that it'll be around in another year or two..

Went in on July 4th, it wasn't too busy and ordered a large latte, went to pay with my card and the internet was down so was asked \"do you have cash?\" Luckily I had $6 on me for my bill of $5.25, I paid and went to take a seat. I had all my books in hand and there were about 5 open tables, all covered with crumbs and dirty - so I grabbed a napkin to clean my own off and sat down and started reading as I was there to study. About 5-7 minutes passed and I saw there was now a small line, I walked to the front and was asked by the same younger kid \"Can I help you?\". I asked on the status of my coffee and he said he should be able to get to it shortly... About 17 minutes from ordering I finally got it.. I felt bad it looked as the kid was there by himself!! This probably explained why it was taking to long and the tables were dirty... by himself, register issues, making the coffee, cleaning tables, busing empty cups, etc... tough to do it all as 1 person!!!

But I then noticed that he wasn't, the OWNER was there on his laptop looking at coffee makers while this poor kid was drowning in orders and running the register by himself and the place was filthy. Then I started looking around at the place probably in my own head looking for the issues...

-The tables were filthy. 
-The floors were filthy. 
-The walls scuffed, maybe never cleaned.
-Under the couches, disgusting.
-The tops of the bins they use to roast their own coffee - ew.
-The lights, maybe never dusted, ever. 
-The catch under the water dispenser.. worse than a dirty fish tank. 

The good news here - the coffee is great, and these are all easy to fix. Please either clean this stuff, make it a job task for your employees, or hire a cleaning company!! But there is only 1 person to look at here, and that's the OWNER who was also there for at least 2 hours I was there so no excuse and no blame on anyone else. Please feel free to write back and I'll try it again and update my post. In the meantime... hope the health inspector doesn't come because that place is gross."}
{"text":"Echo Coffee has a comfortable atmosphere, drawing in a unique crowd of caffeine lovers. On my visit I had the soy latte and the blueberry zuchinni bread which was divine! I particularly love how they make all of their pastries in house out of their little kitchen. I suggest you all take a chance to experience this cafe next time your in the area."}
{"text":"I like this place. Super close to home. Kinda too busy for me at times. But good for them!
Dirty Chai latte....amazing.."}
{"text":"When you order a coffee, it is ground fresh for your order.  Nice touch.  The quality of their beans really stands out.  Atmosphere is quite comfortable - good seating and not cramped.  Good background music."}
{"text":"I live this place. Even their standard roast is amazing. I am here maybe two to three times a week! Got to also love their French press roast... Also they are open until 10 pm every night!"}
{"text":"So this is my local coffee shop.  There's something about this place, leaving the busy street outside to the absolutely chill vibe of Echo...maybe its just the thought that I'm about to enjoy some primo coffee.

When I read Rachel's review of the place, it was almost deja vu, as I asked something similar, \"What kind of milk do you have.\"  What followed was a list of possibly every milk possible, which caught me off guard and ended up just getting it black.  When I get flustered, who knows what to expect.

There's always a good mix of people here, varying ages, but its always quiet enough to get work done, but not too quiet to seem weird."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite coffee shop of all time! Owner Steve Belt is both talented and knowledgable when it comes to coffee roasting. The coffee blends are a delicate balance of different beans roasted to perfection. Each cup of coffee is made to order making the coffee drinking experience superb. The ambiance is both inviting and eclectic. Many different seating arrangements and styles blend together to meet every need while at the same time pleasing to the eye and very comfortable. The icing on the cake is the eye candy on the wall! I highly recommend Echo. I'm certain you won't experience a better cup of coffee anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Echo Coffee.  I don't drink coffee daily or at home, so when I do its a treat... The first time I had Echo coffee, it was a REAL treat!  The coffee is some of the best i've had.... Not acidic or burnt... Yum! What a change from the typically over-roasted starbuck$ latte.  Coffee is fair-priced and doesn't take 10-20 minutes of wait time to get (ahem, Sola.)  I haven't yet tried their sandwiches, but hope to soon.  Keep up the delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"Best thing about Echo coffee is they are CONSISTENT, which sadly is really hard to find.  I travel almost 15 minutes each direction almost every day, passing countless coffee shops to go to Echo, because it is the best.  I've never had their coffee, but the espresso is delicious. I always order an icced soy hazelnut latte, you should try it! Would love for them to offer a loyalty program, but sadly they don't."}
{"text":"Better late then never is all I can say! While Scottsdale was pretty slow to get on the independent coffee shop bandwagon, they're finally stepping up to the plate and this is one of the newest shops to hit the block. 

I've been to Echo a couple of times and I've been pleasantly pleased every time I went. Situated on Thomas, just south of Old Town, the shop is clean and trendy. Free wi-fi is always a coffee shop bonus because let's face it...most people who visit coffee shops want free internet access. Yes, Echo Coffee might call a strip mall home, but don't let that fool you. As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was in a trendy city-style coffee shop. If I closed my eyes, I could almost pretend I was in SF. 

The staff is very chatty and friendly. The coffee blends are unique and dynamic. While I haven't had a chance to try the food, I saw some plates come out and I am counting the minutes before I can go back and taste every option on the menu. They also have a nice selection of pastries; my weakness. My favorite part of Echo coffee is the atmosphere for working. It's perfect to work for a couple of hours or meet a client for a business meeting. Another plus? Outlet plugs to charge your computer. It baffles me that some places lack this simple amenity. 

So all in all, I add this to my list of favorite independent coffee shops located in the Old Town vicinity."}
{"text":"Comfy seating, quiet atmosphere, amazing coffee, and cool music selection makes me happy!!!  Stoked to be here!"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee shop in the valley. It has great coffee that they roast in the shop. Also, it's not too loud, so a lot of people study in there. If you are looking for good drinks and a spot to write a paper, go here. Don't go to SB."}
{"text":"Calming atmosphere and attentive staff. Great environment to study in or to catch up with friends. Definitely will come back here!"}
{"text":"By far the best iced coffee in the area. Very friendly staff, awesome environment to hang out or work in. Love this place"}
{"text":"I love their espresso! I usually prefer my coffee beverages to have a significant amount of milk to balance out the bitterness, but at Echo, I can drink an Americano without anything in it. It's sweet and smooth; very easy to drink. I love that they do offer milk alternatives other than soy. I occasionally get a bit of almond milk in my Americano. The staff is always nice and personable. I don't feel like I have to be super hip to go in there. And they have a tasty vanilla poppy seed muffin, which I'm sure means all the other pastries and breads are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"So I will NEVER write a bad review unless I have been to a place at least 2 times with BAD service. This is the 3rd time I have been at Echo.. All I can say is UGH! This place has miserable people working there. Could you please put on a smile on your face and at least fake it? I mean come on, I am paying $3 and change for a coffee, at least smile and say thank you or something, ANYTHING. I have seen similar reviews, where people say they are rude and I hear their pain. I guess maybe if I was sitting there ALL DAY drinking a glass of water they would have been nice to me, like some of the others, but since I bought a coffee and a bottle of water they are rude? Not sure why, but when I walked out I said Thank you and the people behind the counter said nothing, not a word.
 I am so sick of trying to support local business owners that hire cheap horrible labor, and this is how I am treated. I am gonna stick to Starbucks, I go in there everyday and they always have a smile on their face, faking it or not... I kinda stumbled around putting the cream in my iced to go coffee, (since they put it in a small silver creamer container, instead of in the coffee) so I could see if maybe it was me, but they were the same way to the woman behind me who ordered in. She looked at me and I looked at her, just kinda confused like what is going on? I bet she will not be back either, unless she gets better service from them while she dines in. Echo.... I will go down the road and support my local Starbucks chain. Sorry.... I tried to give you a shot, but this local business will not support yours anymore...."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great - people, coffee, service, etc.

I cannot wait to get some beans to try at home."}
{"text":"On the best days, you'll walk in to the smell of freshly roasting coffee beans, a special blend created by the ever-present owner, Steve Belt.  On the second best days, you'll wonder if it can be any better, and then you'll walk in on one of the best days, where you'll smell the freshly roasting coffee by ... wait, I said that already.

To top off the atmosphere, which is extremely conducive to working, because the music isn't blaring, like some other coffee shop near Indian School and Central (which has its place), the menu is excellent.  Carylann Wooton, a transplant from Liberty Market, created it from scratch, and uses nothing but organic ingredients.  My favorite is the Mediterranean Tuna.

Excellent quality, excellent service.  Prices on food?  A bit more than I'd like to see, but oh so tasty."}
{"text":"I loved their coffee so much and this is one of my favorite coffee places in the valley. BUT something has been changed. The latte is not hot and taste nothing. Spoo dispaonted. I never want to go there again."}
{"text":"This is the best almond milk chai I've ever had. Expertly made by the barista working tonight. I paid for a medium, and he on accident grabbed a large cup, so made me the large. Perfectly steamed; this girl is happy!"}
{"text":"My coffee was good, but I also only ordered a vanilla latte.. 
When I asked what muffin was what, they told me \"uh, I don't know what those are\" no effort to find out what kind they were because they obviously could care less ... How do you not know what muffins you're selling on display?.. Overall, probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Their coffee is really good (not phenomenal, but really good), and they offer almond milk for lattes! (and soy, rice milk, organic milk) - low calories, not overly processed, almond milk is the way to go.  Food wise I've only tried the Turkey and Brie, and that was before their menu changed so it might be different now, but it was really good.

The best thing about this place is the atmosphere - its a cute coffee shop, and its perfect to put in long hours studying. Its not overly loud or distracting, there's always plenty of options for seating, and the wifi is strong.  The baristas are also really helpful and will take the time to talk with you about the various drinks to find you something you'll like.  

Keep it up Echo!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since my first visit and have been suitably impressed with the food and coffee. 

The service is still less than warm, but hasn't been rude.

It's nice to know it's here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The BEST latte. Strong but not bitter or burnt, plenty of foam, and just the right amount of milk to smooth it all together. They give you a little cookie on the side when you enjoy it \"for here\" that's equally delicious. The atmosphere here is not too loud and there are tables outside when you need more space. It's not overly crowded, but there's enough going on to let you know it's not a library. This is the perfect coffee shop in the greater Phoenix area for getting work done while drinking a superb latte."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the area. I have some friends and family who always request to come here when in town. They make their pastries, and their scones are scrumptious. Love their loose leaf tea selection, for time I'm not I. The coffee mood. Big fan."}
{"text":"Great coffee, nice study environment! The baristas were very welcoming. Plenty of tables with scattered outlets."}
{"text":"Love this coffee  place, nice workers and good ambiance and good coffee too!"}
{"text":"Quiet, relaxing atmosphere. Tables and couches available. Pretty good coffee. Beats Starbucks, if that's your standard. Friendly staff and use dishes for orders that are staying in. The only little thing is my coffee came out a bit lukewarm."}
{"text":"Sleek, nice, and smooth -- no I'm not talking about the coffee.  It's the place.  Not your typical Starbucks my friends.  Echo is a quaint local coffee shop that has some good pastries and a nice place to lounge and hangout.  I enjoy their couch area -- very homey.  Anyways, I always enjoy my coffee in a coffee mug - not your \"Starbucks\" cup.  Yeah I'm getting sick of those - granted they keep my coffee warm; it's just not the same as a mug :)  I had some oatmeal cookies here - yum!  Indeed goodbye six-pack; we had a good run :(  Haven't tested out their Wi-Fi yet, but I found a new location to study....if I ever have time to study hehe - enjoy!"}
{"text":"A really nice preppy coffee shop,  relaxed ambiance, plenty of space great coffee and pastry. 

The only reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 is their choice of music - they play loud  heavy metal music back to back ... makes it hard for a student like me to read and concentrate. Would have preferred jack Johnson, Coldplay, reggae ... but overall a great coffee shop."}
{"text":"The coffee here is stellar. There really isn't much else to say besides this: order the coffee, it tastes really damn good."}
{"text":"I always order chai tea because I'm not a coffee drinker. 5 stars for the chai, 4 stars for the pastries. I've ordered a couple different ones and haven't been impressed. Pleasant and quiet atmosphere but nothing that really stands out. All of the employees are nice!"}
{"text":"Slowwww service. Cold dry food. Waited 10mins for a small cup of coffee while all the specialty coffees that were ordered after me were done before. First time and last time!"}
{"text":"Ok, look.

I spent the better part of my 20's and early 30's not drinking coffee so I can't consider myself a life-long coffee snob.

But I learn fast.

And after learning that Starbucks is not the end-all, be-all when it comes to coffee - I can almost say that I am no longer a complete rookie when it comes to great coffee.

And in my opinion, Echo Coffee is great coffee.

Top off the great coffee with free wifi and a top-of-the line interior fit and finish of the building and this can probably be declared the best-little-coffee-shop in this part of town.

It just opened today and I got an iced coffee, straight. No sweetener, no additives - just the straight dope.

And yes, it was fantastic.

But I have to admit - I have a big problem with this place and it is one that I will be wrestling with for some time...

It is a little too far from my house to go every day.

Which begs the question: is this place good enough to cause someone to sell their house and move just to be close enough to go to it every day?

I will if you will."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  Stopped by before a hike with my kids and almost hesitated because the establishment looked so nice and was worried about having the kids in there.   The people working could not have been nicer to the kids.  The granola bars were amazing and yogurt was delicious.  Highly recommend.  Very cool looking place and even better food and coffee.  Had a great visit."}
{"text":"Looking for a non-corporate cup of coffee and an espresso! Found this joint through Yelp! 
Great coffee and fun looking spot!"}
{"text":"I like this place for its local charm but after today, I may not be back. It is so unprofessional for employees to fight and cuss at each other right in front of the coffee bar for everyone to see and hear. I understand there might be disagreements but do it in a back room and not at the front counter. I hope the woman yelling was not a manager because she was extremely degrading to her coworker and made being a customer very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The drip really is as good as everyone says. The atmosphere is cozier than my living room. The music is reliably awesome. The service is great.

The owner is here tonight, added bonus.

According to another patron, this place \"Attracts the Awesome.\" I'm inclined to agree."}
{"text":"Perfect iced coffee equals instant 5 stars from me.  Smooth enough to not necessitate any cream or anything!  I've also had a really delightful warm vanilla latte there.  The vibe of this place is very quiet and it has the best wi-fi I've encountered at a coffee shop.  Seating is a bit limited because it's been full of people every time I've been there.  It's really far out of my way but is worth the drive in my opinion.  In terms of the pastries I haven't tried much, there are a lot of vegan options which is cool.  I want to try a sandwich sometime but the window is very limited (like noon to 3 PM) and they're also really expensive.  Maybe someday I'll give it a shot."}
{"text":"It's been a year since my last Echo Coffee review, so it's time for an update.  Actually, despite the fact that Echo is super close to where I live, work, and play, I'm not a regular... but I did go in a few days ago and was reminded of how much I like the place.

This update is actually more about the food and non-caffeinated drink options, since I'm caffeine-free as of late.  Note that the chef changed in the last few months, so the menu is fairly new.  Lunch is served from 11am - 3pm, but if you go before or after that, you're fairly screwed when it comes to food options.  Luckily, I arrived around 1:30 so I was in luck.  I ordered the tuna sandwich (Tuna, apricot, and shallots tossed in an apple cider vinaigrette with avocado, sprouts, roma tomatoes, and swiss cheese on whole wheat).  The bread was a tad bit dry but I liked the sandwich nonetheless.  And I loved the little side of homemade seasoned popcorn that came on the side.  I washed it all down with a wonderful tart lemonade.

Whether you're looking for a cup of coffee, a lemonade, a place to get some work done, hold a meeting, or have a decent lunch (between 11 and 3), give Echo a shot."}
{"text":"I would get coffee from here rather than starbucks or anywhere else. Hand drip, fresh and their coffee beans are of very good quality. Too bad this place is far from my home."}
{"text":"What can I say about this pace but OLD SCHOOL.  It's more like a quite study hall than a bustling coffee shop.  

This place is no Starbucks! You aren't going to get your name on a cup, or shouting out orders as you wait in line but you will get a damn good cup of coffee that rivals Starbucks.  

I know,  how dare I but it's true.  I was shocked and amazed by the quality of coffee they were serving. 

Boy, was it delicious!

I had an Americana hot and my hubby had one iced, they were both awesome. 

Don't get me started on the raisin, coconut and carrot loaf.... shut the front door..... I was licking my finger and trying to scrap the crumbs off the plate.  This is sad and I just finished my own amazing banana loaf slice.  

How greedy can one human be!!! No guilt here....

The pastry selection is small but everything was good!

Try this place, it's a hidden gem that needs to be discovered.  

Seats are limited so go enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here for quick lunch.. Ouch- my $7.5 salad had CANNED pears. \"Fresh\" and \"from scratch,\" Echo online menu? Not so much! Very disappointed. Wouldn't come back as all other times weren't positively memorable either. I love supporting local business (especially when coffee is involved), yet I am left anticipating higher quality when it comes to food AND customer service. Is that too much to ask, Echo?"}
{"text":"We are home Toddy-ers and swear by the STAG roast after having it here one day. Now we're hooked.Toddy is much smoother, with much less acidity so you can enjoy more of the good stuff. We drive out of our way to get here and highly recommend to others. Nice, bright atmosphere and perfect for meetings or social. Pastry case looks good too but proud to say I haven't tried yet. Good beans. Good atmosphere. Good find."}
{"text":"Echo is an awesome spot in old town for studying or reading. Friendly staff and good coffee. It's one of my 3 go-to spots and has never let me down. 4+ years. 

To anyone who complains about service: I stopped in the other night to do some work, there was a younger guy working alone behind the counter. I left him a decent tip and when he came to give me my coffee, he brought change with him because he figured I had made a mistake. That kind of integrity impresses the s$$t out of me and it is a reflection of both that young man's moral compass as well as the values that echo imparts on its team. If you find yourself offended by the extremely kind and honest staff at Echo, you should frequent Starbucks more often where you can find other low caliber customers. Smile, be kind and the world is a much nicer place:)."}
{"text":"Decent coffee. My review is based on global coffee standard, not local standards, so will be lower than most.

They roast their own beans in-house which is nice. 

Ordered a cortado as I'm untrusting of straight espresso at new places. They do full extraction shots, not ristretto shots. They really need to do ristretto shots with their beans. The coffee is bitter even as a cortado. Hint of sweetness in the background. If I can convince the barista to do a ristretto shot, I think their coffee may very well shine and I'd get an espresso. Next time, maybe. 

Based in local standards in Phoenix, they'd get 4 stars, maybe a 4.5 if they were extracting ristretto shots. I can see their dedication, but they need to spend a few weeks traveling to major cities and seeing what others are doing, lots of room for improvement here, but so far the best coffee I have found in Phoenix.

WiFi is weird. 4 ms ping is amazing, but really slow speeds. Need to ask for password, which I think is better than an open network as it cuts out the leeches. 

Restrooms were clean and fresh. 

Global score, 3.  Local score, 4."}
{"text":"The one-star review is for 1-thing only and will hopefully be removed.  We'll see.

The 1-thing?  Abominable customer service.  Here goes:  I was having a horridly difficult day yesterday with meetings scattered around the Valley  starting late difficult traffic  arrived at my 3PM at Echo at 2:55PM, waiting on line 7 minutes before I could order.
At 3:02PM I asked for a coffee and sandwich (I hadn't eaten anything since a quick 7AM scoop of oatmeal and was famished).
I was told the kitchen closed at 3PM and they would not consider making a sandwich.  They offered me pastries from the front counter.  That does not a lunch make.  I declined, got my coffee and had my meeting.
I didn't eat until I got home at 6PM.
They hadn't closed the kitchen door when they refused to make a sandwich and I could see all of the ingredients sitting on the kitchen's work counter.
I didn't take issue with the young woman who stridently advised me a sandwich was impossible.  I don't argue with subordinate staff who are presumably only following orders.  No one senior to her was in evidence.

I will simply avoid scheduling meetings at Echo and try to persuade people who want to meet there to meet somewhere else.

When I have clear and abundant evidence this customer service standard has been vaporized I will return.  And change this 1-star rating."}
{"text":"After a few visits, my feelings are mixed for Echo coffee. 

What I like about Echo coffee is that they roast their own coffee beans in house, offer a variety of different non-milk options (soy, almond milk) and have plenty of comfortable places to sit and work or relax while enjoying a beverage. They have couches, chairs, and plenty of tables inside not to mention seating outside when the weather permits. Also great that they offer free wi-fi and there's a good number of outlets available inside to work. 

What I don't like about Echo is the hipster, \"I'm too cool to care\" attitude of some of the baristas. Now, don't get me wrong - some are quite friendly - but on several occasions I've encountered male baristas that really didn't seem to give 2 cents about my satisfaction as a customer. For example, I had a great cappuccino one visit and returned a few weeks later to enjoy another delicious cap - only it was really not tasty AT ALL. I added sugar and then finally swallowed my pride and told the barista that I hate to complain but the cappuccino is stronger and tastes differently from what I had before. Rather than offering to re-make the drink, he argued wth me and told me I probably had a latte last time. Which is funny, because I took a photo of the drink so I knew it wasn't a latte and explained this. Anyway..he offered to add vanilla syrup and called it a day. Not impressed. 

I want to support a local business and love that y'all roast your own coffee beans, but c'mon..get it together! Be nice to your customers and they'll happily return. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I think you should serve a great coffee drink every time not just when you feel like it."}
{"text":"A great coffee shop! Love the environment, iced coffees are perfect and the side choices of pastries are perfect compliments. I love that this is my neighborhood coffee shop. It is also a great place to sit down and hang out. Would recommend this joint to anyone!"}
{"text":"Well it's an nice place. I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but since Yelp still doesn't allow half stars (seriously Yelp, do something about it!), 4 stars it is. 

I was meeting a friend for a laid back Sunday afternoon coffee. I have never been here before, and I always like exploring new places. Atmosphere inside was good, although little too quiet. Don't get me wrong, there was music playing, but everyone was so into their iPads and Macs that I was afraid to talk without half whispering. There is couple of tables outside and eventually we moved there. I like that barista/owner brought the coffee to our table which was a nice touch.

Coffee is very good. They offer soy, almond and rice milk also. I still take mine with just plain ol' cow's milk, but I thought that was a nice touch for all those coffee hipsters. There is variety of pastry, looked good but I haven't tried any. However, it is pricey, so if you're in the mood to spend money on good coffee, this is you place.

I live way far from Echo Coffee, but if I am in that area again, I will probably stop by (provided I'm not in frugal mood)"}
{"text":"Echo is the neighborhood coffee shop I was waiting for. What I wasn't expecting was for it to become my neighborhood lunch spot as well. I'm stuck on the Cubano. It is all kinds of yummy roast pork and stuff. Since I can't break away from that, my wife tried the Mediterranean Tuna sandwich and it was so good that we split sammiches next time.

Keep up the good work, Echo. You definitely deserve the following you're garnering. Plus, I'm glad to see that building put to some good use. Hopefully some other quality businesses will fill in the open spot(s) and we'll have even more reason to make it a destination. A kickass Mexican market would be awesome. There is definitely both the Hispanic and Gringo crowd to support it in the area.

As for the lack of free refills... doesn't that imply that if I didn't drink 1 gallon of tea that I got ripped off? What about all of us 1 big beverage drinkers who are satisfied with the price we pay for our 1 drink. Are we supposed to feel stupid for not maximizing our liquid intake? To me, free refills make sense if you're at a sit-down place that is primarily about food and you're going to be there a longish time due to the food service. For a place that is primarily a coffee/beverage spot with some good food, allowing people to sit and drink free drinks all day would be a bad business decision. If you disagree, open up the Free Refills joint next door. Prove me wrong.

Perhaps a compromise is to add a discounted refill to the menu. That will please the regulars who hang out and abuse the T3 and serve those who suck down lots of liquids in a short time.

(a T3/DS3? really? i have my doubts that an entire T3/DS3 is being dedicated to this shop. that's enough bandwidth to serve a good-sized office building and host some websites with good traffic. a simple Cox cable connection is a fraction of the cost and often far faster.)"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee! Love the atmosphere! Great vibes for studying. I love the fact that they have a super open space with lots of light brightening up the whole shop! They roast their own coffee which is super unique and impressive with their small space!"}
{"text":"Not a lot you can say about a coffee shop. They all seem to follow a Starbucks model, but Echo Coffee does ratchet up the quality of the drinks. I am green tea drinker and I am used to ordering a jasmine green tea and getting a green tea with little or no jasmine flavor. Echo's jasmine green tea tastes like jasmine! Well done!  The atmosphere is relaxing and of course they have WiFi."}
{"text":"I wish I'd ordered a latte after seeing other people's reviews and pictures. I ordered a nonfat iced chai. It smelled a bit like older milk, but wasn't awful.

The shop is really large with a decent amount of seating, but very few outlets. You also need to get there pretty early if you want a seat because it seems like there are a lot of regulars who come early and claim a spot. There was a good mix of seating - stools at the bar, couches, arm chairs, and tables with wooden chairs.

Overall, nice atmosphere but again, the lack of outlets was a big issue since I was there to study for a few hours. It would have been perfect for hanging out with a friend."}
{"text":"Wow the coffee is superb, there's no doubt about that! I got an iced dirty chai with rice milk (they were out of almond milk. Bummer). Hubby got a cappuccino. Excellent execution and flavor.

But I just don't feel comfortable here. Service, while not rude, was not warm and definitely not friendly. I walked up to the counter and the guy basically stared at us. It was awkward.

I also feel like it's overpriced. My regular sized drink was $5.25! 

We usually like to chat a bit with the baristas or owners about their coffee and what not, but we were just not digging the vibe of this place. Maybe because we had our kids with us that we kind of got the cold shoulder? It's not like we were staying and hanging out. I don't know. 

Coffee 5 stars for sure. But customer service/atmosphere I give that 1-2 stars."}
{"text":"Echo has great coffee, and the baked goods are amazing! The almond milk latte is great. I love how they come with a little shortbread on the side! On my most recent visit, I had a walnut brownie, which, not even joking, was probably the most divine brownie I've ever had! 

There are several small tables (some outside and some inside), a few seats at two bar-type areas, and couches, which make Echo a great study spot. 

Sadly, I have been less impressed by the service. On a few visits, the baristas have been kind of rude, but a few friends who have been in have not had the same experience. I'll keep trying, though, because the food and coffee are great and the atmosphere is great for a study sesh!"}
{"text":"Echo Coffee is the place in Scottsdale that most reminds me of the kind of coffeehouses back home that I liked to visit - quiet, good place to study,  excellent drinks and sandwiches, and not too pretentious or hipster.

First, the atmosphere is fantastic.  There is the prerequisite lounge-y area with the overstuffed couches and coffee table where people can read a book or meet up with friends.  But the main area is filled with tables and chairs - almost like a library - and there are plugs available everywhere.  This place was meant for people who intend to get some work done.

I've only had the drip coffee and the iced tea, and both were fantastic.  The drip isn't charred or burned tasting, and still has that natural sweetness that proper coffee should.  Creaming and sugaring good coffee like this should be a crime.  The iced tea is unsweetened, but is accented with some fruit flavors.

They have an honest to goodness chef on staff, so the sandwiches on the menu are actually pretty good.  The turkey and brie, the pressed Cuban, and the pesto chicken, all simple and all excellent.  One huge plus for this place... and it adds to the ambiance more than you'd think - they use real, high quality plates, cups, and glassware for folks eating in.  This is beyond restaurant grade, it's pretty much the nice stuff that your mom keeps in a drawer and takes out for special occasions.  Yes, this makes a difference.

Prices are a little on the high side and it doesn't take much of a crowd before it's way too crowded.  Remains the only coffee shop I visit when I'm in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"They have a nice blend of coffee. The staff is friendly.  The restrooms need some improvement."}
{"text":"Ceramic mugs, delicious coffee, and awesome baked goods. All that satisfies the tongue and tummy. The great ambience and comfortable environment also make it a great place to meet friends or get some work done.
I also love the accessibility. I started coming here a couple years ago. At that time I was in a terrible accident and was getting around in a wheelchair. The ramp up to the plaza, the open space, and the roomy bathroom with bars to grab were an asset! Back on meet feet and still loving it here!"}
{"text":"Drinks are always good, coffee is fresh.  Don't come here to eat though.  They have some pastries and a few \"bars\" but that's it,"}
{"text":"I've driven by this coffee shop a couple of times and was finally able to go today. It was really cute on the inside and the staff was very, very nice. I got their drip coffee and a chocolate chip muffin. The coffee was really good, but to be honest, I'm not a HUGE coffee snob so I don't know how trustworthy my opinion is. What's really cool is that they roast their own beans and sell them which I love because anything local is lovely. 

Although I'm not a coffee snob, I do LOVE food. Their muffin (which they make themselves) was yummy. It was a little too sweet for my taste because they sprinkle sugar on the top, but the inside was nice and fluffy and they put a TON of chocolate chips inside which I definitely was a fan of. It was actually so big that I took it home for 2nd dessert :)

I do want to try their lunch and latte one day. I love lattes a lot-ay (ha...) and was jealous when I saw other people getting it. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went in for the first time on Sunday. I loved my Iced Latte and the service. The place is happening, and super cozy. I met the owner, Steve, and was super impressed! He is very friendly with the perfect dose of smarty pants :) I will definetly be back!!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Got the iced chai. It was super delicious. I also got a lemon poppy seed muffin which was ok. I came in at around 1 so the muffin was super hard and dry. That's why I'm giving the place a 4 star. The atmosphere and everything else is cool."}
{"text":"Clean, crisp and friendly comes to mind when you walk into Echo. Located in a small shopping center, Echo is hidden gem in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It was my first time here tonight and I had a pleasant and interesting experience. Customer service is A++++!! I'm bummed I didn't asked for anybody's name. My lady barista made a bomb latte for me and personalized my drink, she asked me where would I put my drink in the sweet-o-meter, not exactly that but you know, how much sweetener would I prefer which was a great gesture and my latte was on point!! 

Coffee: 5/5
Customer service: 5/5
Cowboy cookie: 5/5
Ambient: 5/5
Fostering my forgotten wallet and keeping it safe until I realized I left it there: 100000/5

Would def come back, would def recommend!"}
{"text":"I recently tried Echo on a whim one weekday evening last month. Went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Excellent customer service, the barista was friendly and helpful in every way possible. Even brought my friend and I our drinks to the table. The coffee was perfect and the location was relatively easy to find. Seating both indoors and on the patio was available. Definitely recommend this place - give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Meh.Eh.Just okay, I had not been here in yrs decided to give it another try.Latte was lackluster, no worth the $4.25 price tag for sure no flavor nothing special at all.Barista was \" so tired\" don't you know she has to wake up @4 in the morning ? I do because she said this to customer in from of me.No \" hi,\" to us order was actually taken by another guy behind the counter who was the only one to say \" thank you \" to us.Barasta was a brunette who needs a nap and a lesson is customer service."}
{"text":"They roast their own espresso and the bags smelled great but the place itself didn't have a distinct smell. Kind of disappointing, they must have an amazing air flow system. A lot of vegan bakery options, but since I'm not into that, there wasn't much for me here. My chocolate chip muffin was pretty good, though. My latte wasn't that great - I should have gone with a mocha. Overall, a typical local coffee place that caters to the hip."}
{"text":"I absolutely love what this coffee spot stands for. Organic, fresh, and supportive of their local roots. I believe Carolann is the chef, and Steve the owner are quite possibly two of the nicest and passionate people I've met through the process of them getting this locale up and going. Congrats and best of luck with Echo Coffee!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. The barista was nice and I love the chill atmosphere. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Tried several times to get myself to like this place. Coffee itself isn't bad; I just wish it wouldn't come along with the pretentious attitude some (note SOME, not all) baristas there have. It seems like their world is shattered when one has a simple customized request. I simply asked for a dry cappuccino, and they stressed their \"traditional\" cappuccino comes in a small cup. I just wanted a bit more milk, four shots, and foam to make it dry and not a latte. Don't see how this is too hard. I didn't ask for coffee with a side of attitude."}
{"text":"Good coffee and good service. It wasn't amazing, I wouldn't specifically come back, but it did the trick! They didn't have a lot of selection for food, but the banana bread was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Schuyler, Richard, Dylan, Rob and Amanda are always welcoming, play good music and make amazing coffee. It's a nice and quite which makes it the perfect study place, I'm here pretty much everyday now."}
{"text":"Still not in love with it.

Again with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking?

meh."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street from here and I would stop in to get an iced dirty soy chai on the way to work. They make an amazing one, but it is really expensive for a small drink. Free WiFi is nice."}
{"text":"Support your local coffee shop- Buck the Bucks!
The coffee here is roasted right on premise and tastes delicious! The atmosphere is welcoming and comfortable- the perfect place to work, have a business lunch or a great cuppa joe! The baristas are friendly and each cup of coffee is hand made with TLC. They really go to great lengths at Echo to provide an outstanding product. They also have a yummy sandwich and salad menu all made with fresh, local ingredients. So BUCK the BUCKS and grab a CUP at Echo coffee!"}
{"text":"Best cappuccino I have had in Old Town. Balanced espresso/froth . the little latte art, and a nice ceric cup of the right dimensions. Little cookie on the side. Friendly, fast service. My friend got a piece of cake/bread and said it was yummy, too. Americana was hot and full-flavored. Sat outside and listened to the hum of Thomas Rd while sipping my cappuccino. Kind of a perfect afternoon, really."}
{"text":"Echo Coffee is a great place to hang out and sip on some good coffee. The coffee isn't as good as some other coffee shops, but it's the best in the area and the environment is great. The service is also great."}
{"text":"Only came here once. Everything was satisfactory. I didn't try anything they had which was a specialty to them, so that's why only 3 stars. Wasn't blown away by anything, but I will come back if I am in the area, and would love to up the stars  on this review :)"}
{"text":"Echo coffee satisfied me with a sugar free, almond milk, vanilla latte. They have a awesome pour over station right up front. The price and service was great! Very efficient and fast the staff moved with urgency. The restrooms were under some sort of re-construction that was very dirty. 
A great place to take your laptop and study :)"}
{"text":"Along with Cartel, this is one of my favorite coffee shops in the area.  It is slightly less hipster and a bit more relaxed than some other places, with good coffee and a wonderful staff.  Comfortable, high ceilings, decent acoustics, and plenty of tables, couches, and chairs to work, chat, or watch."}
{"text":"Everything at Echo Coffee is roasted in house on Tuesday.  That's how fresh it is.  Kona special right now is awesome."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee you will put in your mouth around Scottsdale!  They even give the hardcore hipster places in Downtown Phoenix a good run for their money too!  The staff is always pleasant to deal with, and they know what the hell they're talking about, go Echo!"}
{"text":"I've swung into Echo a few times and haven't ever had a bad cup of coffee. The cappuccino is pretty solid and the zucchini bread I had for breakfast one day was a win. If I recall correctly it came in a cute little box too.

For some reason I've never been able to feel relaxed and at home enough to chill and enjoy an afternoon or evening there. Not sure why, but just haven't."}
{"text":"Defiantly..OK next time I'm feeling like an angry anarchist, rude rowdy rebel or just a wee bit piggishly pugnacious I will march my way to ECHO..sounds perfectly perfect ..MERIBAH'S review made my decision easy because now I know where I can get great coffee and I don't have to be all smiles..DEFIANTLY...lol"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Echo coffee. 
The baristas are always super helpful (and patient when you don't know what you want.) They also always put a cute design on top... call me trivial. 
They have a variety of milks (whole/ half and half/ non fat/ soy/ almond) and do an awesome espresso pour. 

They roast all their beans in house. It is my favorite smell to walk into the door and they are roasting... it's intoxicating. 

The owner is super nice and when he is around always willing to answer questions about the roasting process, where they get their beans and any coffee inquiries you might just be wondering about. 

Always recommend this place to people if you're going to be in the area. 
*They do offer sandwiches and salads from 11-3 and have pastries all the time. 

Chill enough to go and grab a cup and hang out... can get a little crammed but most everyone there is really polite and will even share a table if you're up for it. 

Definitely worth a little drive if you're into checking new coffee houses out. 

Great hours, open 6a-10p every day!"}
{"text":"I've been to Echo a number of times and I'm never disappointed. Their lattes are delicious, the ice tea is so refreshing but the real winner is the chai tea, it is literally addicting. It's a good study spot and also a good meeting place to catch up with friends. The customer service is a great Skyler (the barista that is always there when I'm there) and I are on a first name basis. He makes it a point to have a conversation with you and be hospitable. After writing this I think I might have to get a chai because I've been thinking about it ever since I wrote about it. Dang it haha."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in town. Desserts are great. The cold brew never fails. Great place to study."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Echo when I was in law school and needed a place to study that wasn't Lux.  Echo was reliable in that I could find a seat and camp out a while.  My experiences were limited to occasions where I was staying for several hours, thus speed of service never stood out. 

Fast forward to present time (by that I mean December 2016).  I didn't have time to make coffee before heading downtown for work.  Rather than stopping at any of the several Starbucks on my way, I decided to keep it local and visit my old hangout.  Bad call.

I popped in to order just a medium dark roast, expecting a quick in-and-out.  I could not have been more incorrect in my judgment.  After my transaction was completed I saw them pull out the pour-over to make my coffee.  I wasn't thrilled, but I had a couple minutes so no big deal.  I parked at one of the bar stools and waited for my coffee.

Several minutes pass.  No coffee.  I'm starting to wonder how long a pour-over takes and trying to recollect how long my pour-overs at home take me, to no avail (I've never timed it...).

After over 10 minute pass, with the staff lollygagging behind the counter and/or chatting up an apparent regular, I approached the counter and asked if they had light-roast ready to go.  They informed me that, no, it's all pour over.  Frustrated, I walked back to my stool, but there was a glimmer of hope as they appeared to be finishing my coffee.  Alas, that glimmer was quickly snuffed out as they merely applied more water to the pour over...something that could have likely been done much earlier in that preceding 10 minutes.

At that point I was at the end of my rope.  Admittedly angrily, I told them to just give me whatever amount of coffee was available because I didn't have time to wait around any longer.  [No, that's not just me being self-important, they took me from being early to work to being late.]

The coffee was good, at least.

But after spending at least 10, if not 15, minutes waiting for pour-over coffee, I decided to run a few trials at home using my pour-over system.  I found that in under 10 minutes I could boil a kettle of water, grind the beans, and make well-over 20oz of coffee.  Echo couldn't do that and they had the head start of having heated water already.

I emailed Echo using the email address on their website to tell them of this visit.  My thought being I'd contact them first to give them an opportunity to respond before I reviewed them on this experience.  It's been almost two months and no reply at all.  Hence, my disappointing last-visit (double-entendre intended) is now a 2-star review."}
{"text":"Good coffee and food!

Baristas range from totally awesome to automatons.

However, it's no secret that the music here is not only repetitive, but terrible. Everyone from baristas to customers tends to agree on this point, which is why you will see a sea of headphones if you look around. Seriously, one can only take so much Bjork, and any James Blunt at all is too much James Blunt, right?

This probably doesn't help the community feel. It's rare to make friends here, since everyone is in their own audio zone."}
{"text":"I really love this coffee house. I actually visited it twice today-once for a meeting and later just to hang out. They have -great coffee ( real macchiatos, and proper cappucinos), great treats and quiet enough to get work done if you need. Only complaint is the music-yes, I'm happy they don't blast rock-there's a time and a place for loud music but the generic soft rock they were playing this afternoon lead us outside to escape-I suggest they do a bit of research, or ask a hipster barrista or customer to give them a play list of acceptable soft-quiet music-I'm thinking Andrew Bird, Iron and Wine, Nick Drake, etc. if you want to keep the mellow mood, don't resort to the piped in muzak version."}

2.5 stars.

First time @ Echo Coffee!  Funny, I expected a lot more polish and flare, trippy ambience, highly-charged even (!), after looking at the glossy online photos, but the space looked tired and neglected; I certainly didn't feel like I had to occupy this space any longer than to grab a cup of coffee and some pastries.  Even the merchandise section (cups, bags of coffee, and poorly-stocked Echo-logo shirts) was in disarray.  Who would feel like they'd like to buy a souvenir from here?  Unfortunately, even the photos I took of the pastries mirror the sad state I found their former home in :(

If you like cranberry-oatmeal cookies, then you must try Echo's version- chewy and moist, CHOCK-FUL of dried cranberries, oatmeal, and nuts (almonds, I think).  All the ingredients balanced each other out so that the cookie wasn't cloyingly sweet.  The slice of banana bread, which came highly-recommended by the server/cashier, was a different story; Hefty-portioned, it also looked moist and full of delightful banana-goodness, but felt very dry, hardened almost, and didn't have much flavor.  I felt duped into paying for a day-old (or maybe even two days-old!) slice.  Dipping the cake into the coffee didn't help matters.  All the dipping did was deposit grease into my black coffee...  I just chucked it in the trash.  Shame on you, Echo!

Ah, but I might still come back, bec. the drip coffee and cookie filled my need for speed.  Caffeine and sugar, that is.  I really appreciate the fact that everything served here was made w/ organic ingredients!  I will say that the customer service was friendly and helpful- always a plus!"}
{"text":"pretty cool joint. food was good, drinks were good. nice lounge areas. definitely a great spot!"}
{"text":"One of those neighborhood gems that you want to see succeed. 
Good coffee and specialty coffees.  Fun places to sit and chat with a variety of choices.... couch, counter, bistro tables etc.  and it's CLEAN!"}
{"text":"Really good drip coffee that has a rich yet smooth dark lasting flavor. Helpful and cheerful staff, pleasant environment with both couches and tables, medium volume and light, easy to relax or get work accomplished. Separate and clean bathrooms. Pleasantly cool on the crazy hot summer days!

They also have an assortment of pastries and deserts. My GF loved the chocolate pecan pie!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick meeting here.  Perfect little neighborhood coffee shop.  $4 for a coffee, great pastries.  

However, the regular clientele was very frightening.  I immediately discovered upon entry that ECHO must be the place where all of the hipsters in the East Valley gather when they are not out publicly complaining about everything in the world. 

Hipster Alert!  HIPSTER ALERT!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really bummed. I've been here a few times to study and overall had a decent experience. This morning I stopped in for an iced chai and decided to try their food for the first time. Aweful! I ordered a vanilla poppyseed muffin and it was dry and tasteless. I told the guy behind the counter, so he took the muffin and threw it away. After a few awkward seconds I asked for a refund. He siad he could get me something else, but couldn't refund $2.75 for a muffin. I thought he was joking and laughed, then he said, \"No I'm serious. My system doesn't do that.\" I asked for the owner or manager's email and he curtly told me it was on the website. Sad to have such bad food and service!"}
{"text":"Echo Coffee is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Scottsdale! I go 4 or 5 times a week! The staff is always friendly and helpful, their music selection in rad, and their muffins and scones are out of this world delicious! 
I better go get a latte right now!"}
{"text":"Great chai! Lots of milk options like almond, soy, and coconut, which is a plus. I enjoy the variety of homemade baked goods as well. Nice seating area inside and a table out front as well. Free pw protected wifi. Good place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Echo Coffee is great! I would probably go there on a regular basis if I lived close enough.
The coffee is delicious and well made.. and organic. I always feel good about myself when I eat/drink something organic.
The people are great there and I love how they give those little cookies.. it makes it 10x better because at most coffee places you only get a coffee.

Plus the coffee looks so beautiful when they hand it to you, I always have to wait a minute before I drink it just so that I can admire that beautiful coffee."}
{"text":"I'm a big coffee drinker (at least a cup a day), but that being said I'm not much of a coffee \"snob.\" Sure there's some places I like better than others, but I'm perfectly fine w/espresso over ice from Starbucks or *gasp* coffee from Dunkin Donuts. 

That's probably why I'm not blown away by Echo Coffee. Sure, I like local coffee shops like this. Even though I only stopped in for an iced coffee to go, the place seemed to be a nice spot to hang out at. I liked the high ceiling, the \"open\" atmosphere, and the plenty of seating that they offer, but quite honestly, the coffee was just okay. Maybe I'm just used to the \"cheap stuff\" (I DO drink Dutch Bros. at least 2-3x/wk), but the coffee here just tasted a bit acidic. 

I don't have an issue with this place charging a bit more compared to chains, but at the end of the day, I'd rather pay a little less for coffee I like better. 

The baristas here are friendly, though. I came in wearing a Berkeley hat, and I chatted it up w/an employee from the Bay Area for a few minutes who was very nice."}
{"text":"Never had I ever thought I could hate a coffee shop. How wrong I was. My woes first started 3 years ago when I walked it to apply for a job. I was a youngster, innocent to the world of employment. I walked it,more nervous than I had ever been. I asked if they were hiring, and the owner/manager looked me dead in the eye, and the cruel, unforgiving words rolled off his tongue. \"DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN MAKING COFFEE?!?!?!?!?\" I told him I did not, not really thinking about making coffee as something you need to have 'experience' in because it's fucking pouring milk in espresso. He sneered at me with devilish content. \"I only hire PROFESSIONAL baristas@%@$!&!%\". My heart dropped in my poor little chest. I nodded and got some coffee, which tasted of defeat and failure. I've been back here only several times and my coffee has been burned every time. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Coffee is great. Although the \"hipster\" barista(s) have a bad vibe. It seems like if you have a \"I'm  too cool hipster vibe\" they love you. If you're just a plain Jane run if the mill the ignore you or drop off your coffee with a \"your bothering me\" attitude.  Excuse me if I don't shop at the local thrift store and ozze out Chromeo through my ear buds while wearing miss matched clothes."}
{"text":"This is really 3.5 stars, but that's not really an option, so....

I was there all day, so I sampled a few different things on the menu. First I had a CAPPUCCINO that was decent. I had a better one at The Coffee Bean earlier in the week, though.  

Next I had the PEAR AND WALNUT SALAD.  For a place that has a mantra \"Fresh. Local. Organic.,\" this salad was way off the mark.  The pears were clearly canned (blech!) and the balsamic dressing was the consistency of BBQ sauce. I'm guessing high fructose corn syrup is a main ingredient. :/  It's served over romaine, which is admittedly better than iceberg, but seriously? Where is the spinach, or at least 50/50 blend?  The chicken also had an odd taste to it. The salad wasn't gross, it just wasn't that good, especially coming out at $10.50 (chicken is $1.75 add-on). Wouldn't be so harsh if the place didn't have \"fresh and local\" as a selling point. 

Finally, I had the DRIP COFFEE, which is definitely worth trying! It's flavorful and each cup is done individually.  I also, like other reviewers, felt guilty adding cream. (It's just how I take my coffee, okay?!)

The baristas were friendly.  The place is A-OK. 

Caution: Come with your laptop charged if you plan to do work. There are very few outlets."}
{"text":"Coffee quality here is great. Boyfriend ordered a chai latte and I ordered a regular latte. I dont normally like chai's but this one was the best I've tasted. It wasn't too sweet or overly nutmeg'd out. The cookie accompaniments are a nice touch. My one gripe is that the ambiance is a little odd. It was packed but dead quiet. I felt as if I was imposing if I engaged in much convo with my bf. It's almost library-esque."}
{"text":"Usually great service, but today was horrible wait times .. so far been waiting over 25 minutes for 2 cappuccinos then finally asked if we were waiting for anything. Couple next to us had extremely long wait for hot choc and cappuccino, and when they finally got them they complained that they both were served cold. Hope service is better next time."}
{"text":"I'd say that since my last review, they've definitely upped their \"treats\" game, and now their pecan pie is a regular \"must-have\" item in my life (along with their banana bread). I don't know if everything is made on-site, but honestly I don't care because it's damned tasty and their coffee is excellent.

edit:  Okay, their treats are made on-site. Another feather in their already quite feathery cap. Come here and treat yo'self!"}
{"text":"Working on work and studying in here currently, as I have regularly in the past. Coffee shops are good for that I would think... Suddenly punk music is blasting over the speakers, the employees seem to find this normal? I have some Nordic death metal and bigger speakers if that's the angle Echo Coffee is suddenly going for..."}
{"text":"Though their drip coffee is good, they don't offer refills even at a discount.  No drip coffee is worth $2.50 PER CUP!  Their service was \"meh\".  It took nearly 10 minutes to get a cup of drip coffee.  If they had to have brewed it, I could understand.  But he just pulled it out of one of those insulated pumps.  I also tried their cranberry scone which was good.  Not overly sweet as so many shops have a tendency to do, nor so dry it is like eating dust.  Overall a nice pleasant atmosphere.  But their overpriced coffee will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"--Good coffee

--Good prices

--Friendly staff.

--Nice, comfy decor.

--Easy parking."}
{"text":"Fantastic espresso/coffee.  Really cool atmosphere.

Wish for more food options."}
{"text":"First, I don't know any of the owners and I\"m not friends with anyone at this place.  this is just an honest review.

Overall, this is a cool place.  Most important, the coffee is good.  It's not burnt like starbucks.

it has free internet.  The place is very clean, has lots of seating inside and plenty of parking.

The only reason 4 out of 5 is that it's a bit sterile.  it's not your typical \"coffee joint\" like a hippy place.  it's kinda like starbucks feel but better coffe.  the other reason is no real selection of morning food.  no muffins or pastries.

conclution:  recommended as a solid option"}
{"text":"I will start with the good.  Coffee and food are good.  I cannot get past the fact the staff is so rude.  I think I am done.  Courtesy people... you are in customer service and the practice of being nice is good for society too!"}
{"text":"Ah, the ubiquitous American coffee shop. Made famous in film noir and faceless by Starbucks and its ilk. Echo Coffee is single-handedly putting the face back in the American coffee shop. 

Whatever your pleasure, Echo Coffee has it. Although specialty coffee drinks aren't sufficient to entice the former presidents living in my wallet to seek a new venue, each time I've been at Echo Coffee, those ordering them have remarked how delicious they are.

If you are in the mood for something to go with your coffee, you'll find ample choices in their dessert case.  My favorite is the walnut brownie, but you should be sure to have someone help you eat it, as it violates the rule, \"Never eat anything bigger than your head!\"

The coffee is outstanding. As noted by other reviewers, they make one mean cup of drip coffee. If you want to treat yourself, order the French Press.

Best of all, if you can't get to Echo Coffee every day, they sell their delicious roasted beans, either whole or ground to your taste, for use in your own coffee maker.

While coffee shops have become as ubiquitous as gas stations once were, Echo Coffee is a standout and worth visiting frequently. In addition to delicious coffee and pastries, the staff is first rate and routinely demonstrates their advanced skill working a coffee maker. They are always welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Great beans! This is where I go to get my afternoon jive on! If you're looking for some quality beans look no further, echo has you covered!"}
{"text":"The outside has the minimalist look--with clean lines. Personally I like it! My favorite green color too! Super tall (floor to, well not ceiling because those ceilings are way up there) windows inside. Lots of them. Windows. Yet the sun wasn't blaring in because there were lovely see-thru screens!

The roasting machinery and scales sat idle, and the beans were in big white buckets. Lots of tables, but also an area with big comfy couches. Young crowd.

Beautiful latte art but my latte was warm (think almost cold). Would have loved it to be much hotter.  Perhaps serving hot lattes a tad warmer would be my suggestion.  It had great taste, and I also loved the addition of the little shortbread cookie!

Several choices for milk options, so customers should be able to find the perfect formula for a drink. 

The bakery/pastry options looked wonderful. Carrot, walnut, coconut loaf named Morning Glory(that has to be healthy and delicious). Everything else looked super healthy. 

Big parking area, which can easily be accessed from 67th or 68th depending on which way you are traveling.

With so many coffee houses to choose from, it is fun to experience different ones before deciding on a favorite! This place is definitely health conscious, which I love!"}
{"text":"I loved it here! The staff was super friendly and effecient. So far we've tried the Chai Tea Latte (heavenly), waldorf salad (perfect for a hot day), and their green tea. We love everything and we love Echo :D"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Echo Coffee from afar. I wish San Diego had a place like this. Back in January, my fiance and I went to Scottsdale for a weekend to visit a friend of his. Sad news: I had a major exam to study for and had to scamper off while they enjoyed life. Happy news: I found this little gem right across the street from our friend's apartment!

So yeah...two trips here in a weekend, totaling more than twelve hours. Those drip coffees are the shit (I should know, I had four of them during my second visit). I also enjoyed a chai latte at some point...not the best one I've ever had, but solid nonetheless.

Food: The breakfast yogurt and granola was awesome, but what really rocked my world was the cold curry chicken salad sandwich I ate for lunch. Seriously amazing...please order it and enjoy it, since I can't.

The service was great too. Apparently they don't kick you out even after you've been there for nine hours straight. There was a point at which I hadn't ordered anything in two hours, but one of the employees still approached me to ask if I needed anything, and to take my trash.

Free wifi, so ask for the password. Cute, modern decor. Good study environment, but also good for a nice meal/chat with friends. Food is perhaps a bit more expensive than other coffee shops, but it was pretty darn good. As was the experience in general. 

And thus continues my hunt for a coffee house just as awesome that isn't 370 miles away..."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here for years. The baristas are helpful and cheerful. They have amazing coffee. This is the perfect quiet place to study or hold business meetings! I wish they would build another one closer to my house but I'll make the drive anytime!"}
{"text":"I had a meeting here the other day, and only ordered a double shot espresso.  That being said, it was one of the most enjoyable espressos I've had in awhile!  I'll be headed back there to see if I can get another pour like that one!"}
{"text":"ella makes the most wonderful cappuccinos in the valley!

very chill place to relax or to use their wifi.

steve, the owner, appreciates all his customers' feedback!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start out by saying that Echo has some truly exquisite coffee. Anytime I feel like blowing a small paycheck on coffee, I come by to treat myself. If you are coming in for a single serving (drip, latte, americano etc), their prices are pretty comparable. But God forbid you are looking to buy whole bean. Then you will be paying upwards of $20/lb. The owner claims this is cheaper than any place in town but I have yet to find a place that has charged me more for beans. 

Anyway, will I continue to get my coffee here occasionally, probably. It is good. Is it \"that\" good to make me a regular my response is \"It's coffee, not ridding the world of global hunger\"

As for the coffee snobbery reports in previous reviews?? I wrote a nice email saying how much I love love loved their coffee, and simply asked if they would consider reducing the price of beans a little so I could buy them more often and here is the email I received back, you be the judge:

\"Regarding our prices, in the marketplace, for the quality of coffee we offer, we are one of the lower prices in town. Countering this, my wholesale costs increased by 80% on green coffee last year, and accordingly my  margins eroded substantially.  I was able to contain most of that cost increase, with a slight 5% increase in my whole bean coffee prices. 

In comparison, I know of no other product I routinely buy where the business owner was able to absorb such a huge price increase, and not pass on more to the consumer (imagine that happening to milk or gas). 

So here's the thing: specialty coffee, like I use and sell at Echo is expensive.  Only 5% of all coffee produced in the world is good enough to be considered specialty coffee, and that's all I use.  That other 95% costs substantially less. Sure, I could switch to this inferior product, so that I could charge you less, but it wouldn't taste as good. 

Anyway, I regret I can't charge you less. Truth be told, what you are asking me to do is very close to just giving it away. As much as I'd like you to drink my coffee, Echo is trying to be a for profit company (a goal we have yet to achieve).\"

Thanks Steve. A simple \"I wish you could but I'm sorry, great coffee is really expensive\" would've done the job. I appreciate you making me feel like crap."}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about this place. I have been coming here now for a little over a year and am obsessed with everything about this shop. From the homemade baked treats, quiche, atmosphere, PHENOMENAL employees, and well of course the fabulous coffee. (Their coffee really is one of a kind) keep up the great work, Echo!! Much love :)"}
{"text":"I used to visit this place mainly for monthly committee meetings for a non-profit I used to do some work for.  I also have occasional \"coffee client meetings\" here.  My prior experiences would have warranted a 4 star rating.  Usually at least friendly and acceptable service with a decent cup of coffee and atmosphere.

Unfortunately, I just had an inexcusable experience here and it knocked my rating down to 2 stars.  If based on today only, this would be a 1 star rating.

Environment is decent.  True to many other reviews, this is not a Starbucks type of place.  Definitely has a more local type of coffee shop.

When I walked in today, I was met by a barista who was less than excited to be at work.  She was working hard to clean up and worked non-stop, and did what she was supposed to, but was MUCH less than enthusiastic and friendly about her work. Not a smile to be seen.

On this lazy Sunday afternoon, I ended up on the phone with a friend of mine, who decided to come and join me.

We were sitting at the bar closest to the barista.  After a short visit, the barista suddenly said (in a not a very friendly fashion), \"I'm sorry.  I don't have anyone to take the next shift and you are going to have to leave.\"  We were shocked and didn't really understand, as closing time was later and we hadn't hear her say anything to any other patrons.

We were apparently the first.  We watched her walk through the packed coffee house to every table and kick everyone out abruptly.  When I say abruptly, we were outside on the sidewalk within 3-5 minutes.

I understand that life happens.  Coming from a lifetime background in the hospitality business myself, I truly understand scheduling frustrations, etc.  However, the LAST people that need to experience your bad day is the customer!!

In our opinion, this barista could have been much more friendly and her customer relations skills were pitiful, at best.  She put absolutely NO effort into being friendly and communicating her needs.

If this is the experience that Echo Coffee has come to offer, I will not be coming here again.

If not for past experiences in this place, I would NEVER come back.  As it stands, I may try one more time.  If I experience another \"angry\" barista, this place is off the list."}
{"text":"I am SO glad that this place is doing well.  The coffee is great and the atmosphere very chill.   SOOOO much better than any other coffee place around my area.   Thanks for coming to the hood!  I love the friendly staff and the assortment of chairs, vibes, and diverse reading/info!"}
{"text":"Their iced chai is far superb. I am very picky with my chai and it's the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. Almond milk is my preference. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming! :) SO happy I found this place so close to my house!"}
{"text":"I remember coming here the first time on whim and got some good studying in while enjoying a hot latte. Went back this past weekend and was surprised to find myself in an unfamiliar setting. For some reason, it seemed less like a homey/study environment type of coffee shop this time around. However, the iced dirty chai latte was served to perfection. I enjoyed every sip of it. 

Then my airheaded self accidentally left my phone by the water counter. Fortunately, they found it and kept it for me until I returned. This gives them an extra star."}
{"text":"I love the coffee. It's really rich. The atmosphere is excellent too, the coffee roaster is actually in full view and you can watch the coffee being roasted. The sweets at the from counter are top notch! The Pecan pie is the bomb."}
{"text":"Much better than coffee bean in my opinion. The American coffee is really actually a European style long espresso and I love it. This is a good place and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Echo Coffee has simple offerings, but everything is high quality, and the ambiance is far superior to Starbucks. I met a friend here for coffee today, and we both ordered iced lattes.

Our iced lattes were perfect. The espresso was rich and creamy, the perfect treat on a hot day. There was plenty of seating, even during a popular coffee break time. I can't wait to return and try their French Press!"}
{"text":"I drop by here when I'm in the area. Always great coffee and friendly people. Fast service and free wifi makes it a fun meeting place."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for great cafes that serve up a good buzz and provides an atmosphere to optimize productivity. Though Echo is quiet and quaint as a corner cafe, I found the coffee lacking. I ordered a latte which was provided with a tiny shortbread type of biscuit and found it to be too drowned out with milk and with a poor, over frothed foam that dissipated quickly. The shortbread biscuit was nice, but too small and fit as a dog treat.

The shop itself is probably the best part, great for lounging or working. I found outlets readily accessible and loved that it was quiet, but not dead silent. People here are respectful and take their calls outside, thank you.

Unfortunately, this cafe that roasts their own coffee and serves up Organic whatever has a little bit more work in it's craft. Perhaps try something besides their lattes, as there seems to be a reoccurring theme within these reviews ... so I must not be the only one."}
{"text":"Great coffee! 

There is a lot of coffee out there, but believe me it is NOT all good. 

Echo has great coffee! 
Isn't that enough? 
What more do you want?

Ok, they do have food and other drinks . . . . but if you are a caffeine fan, go for the coffee. The other stuff will be a nice accompaniment. 

That's all."}
{"text":"Coffee is fine but damn $6.75 for a 20oz iced mocha! I could even live with that but they should at least give me a smile with it, not even a 'thank you' I mean come on! You guys need to remember you are in a customer service industry..."}
{"text":"Great handcrafted coffee. Very personable staff and their pastries are home made. Delicious cranberry scone that was still warm"}
{"text":"I personally love Echo coffee so much that I travel from the west side of town just to get a bag of coffee. My entire family are faithful buyers of your coffee beans. Thank you again for putting a smile on our face with each cup of brew"}
{"text":"I love Echo Coffee, and here's why:

1(They're open late

2(There are lot's of outlets so you don't have to fight for laptop-charging privileges

3(The drinks are excellent

4(Customers here actually know how to use their indoor voices

Like I said, the drinks are great; I've never tasted burnt espresso once. Honestly though, it's the atmosphere I love most. Most of the customers are there to study, and the one's that are there to socialize are mindful of the fact that the rest of us are working. Unfortunately my other favorite coffee shop, The Coffee Plantation on Shea, always seem to be full of obnoxious teens, speed chess players, and other forms of loud patron. Of course, this isn't a bad thing business wise (well, the teenagers are actually pretty bad, but I can't Yelp people's parents), but it is nice to be able to come to Echo and get away from the bustle. Also, they play really good music!

My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the girl at the counter isn't particularly sunny. I walked in while she was flirting with a customer, and I could tell that she was annoyed that she had to stop to take my order. The gentlemen, however, are always very pleasant."}
{"text":"I love the espresso! It's strong, but thankfully not bitter, unlike many other places. They sell Maya Chai, so it's the same great quality as Cartel, King Coffee, and other local shops. 
I enjoy the spacious seatibg and decor. I'll definitely be back when I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Echo Coffee is GREAT great!  They are really friendly and they know their coffee.

My espresso drink was flawless in it's execution.  FLAWLESS flawless!

I loved the atmosphere.  Modern and sleek but warm and welcoming at the same time.

The pastries looked great but I resisted the urge to purchase one...then my mocha arrived with a dainty little shortbread cookie alongside-it was delicious. 

Echo Coffee roasts their own beans on site-a hallmark of a true coffeehouse.  EXCELLENT! Excellent."}
{"text":"They really take their coffee seriously. To the point that I felt guilty for putting milk and sugar in mine. But I should feel a little guilty. The coffee there is artful. 
 I was really enjoying the pleasant conversation with who seemed to be the owner. Until He made a comment that people of my \"gender\" are really bad at ordering coffee. Then immediately insulted my age. I was pretty taken aback since we were chummin it up until then.  Overall a great coffee joint, if you don't mind purchasing your cuppa joe from the coffee nazi"}
{"text":"I just love the atmosphere. The Staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable. I've never had anything on the menu that wasn't spectacular and I'm kind of a coffee snob so it's great to go to a place you can count on quality product all across the board!"}
{"text":"I discovered Echo Coffee a few weeks ago, and now I've been there twice. I had lunch once, and dessert once. Everything I've had was delicious. 

I love that the shop has tons of options for milk - I've never been anywhere else that offered almond milk, which is delicious. I had a sugar-free hazelnut macchiato with almond milk, and it was heavenly! Their coffee is very good. 

Food: what I've had was good, though the grilled cheese is a little overpriced. I will definitely repeat this at home - toasted bread with three types of cheese, including blue cheese, which is a brilliant idea. The chocolate-blueberry brownie is an absolute must-have, so definitely have it!

Overall a great place to chill at lunchtime or after dinner. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Echo is okay as far as independent coffee is concerned.

I've had a hazelnut latte with almond milk, a regular latte, hot chai and iced chai. The middle two were really good. The hazelnut latte somehow did not taste like anything, and the iced chai I got today was also extremely weak and flavorless... I watched the girl pour in an entire cup of milk so I'm not sure how much of that was tea or the chai mix. They use a LOT of ice, which seems like they're trying to water it down almost.

I dunno, but if I'm going to order frou-frou coffee drinks, they should taste like the excessive flavors and sugar I'm paying for. Ya dig?

On the monetary note, $4.50 for an iced chai was pretty steep.

Also, I asked for a cup of water today and she just handed me a cup full of ice with a lid. I felt pretty stupid asking \"Wait, where's the water?\" so I looked around for maybe a DIY spigot deal, but there wasn't one. I'm still really confused.

My friend says the black tea is really good, and it's a cute little shop though, and a pleasant place to hang out in with local newspapers and art to read and of course, wi-fi, so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"They reallllllly need to work on their customer service. Not a crack of a smile, never a thank you. Just rude, seemingly unhappy girls making coffee. Who won't repeat your order to you, so make sure it's not complicated. The coffee is fine. Oh, and there's a tip line, so give them extra if you're tipping for product and not the bitches behind the counter. If you're choosing between Starbucks and Echo, it's a toss up! Starbucks coffee sucks but you never feel like a burden in their stores. Echo coffee is better than Starbucks, but it should be preceded by some Zoloft or another antidepressant so don't leave more pissed off than your pre-coffee morning self."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night before meeting a friend. I heard some great things about Echo Coffee so I tried to give it a try! One of the things that impressed me was how bright the inside was. I'm a student looking for the optimal study spots. This seems like a place that I can write a paper in and spend all day in. There are so many tables and I love that the night time has lots of lighting. =] I ordered an Iced Coffee, and to my dismay, it wasn't the best I've ever had. I still have lots of hope for this place, so I'll just have to give a couple other drinks a try! I wish this place was 25 mins closer to my place, because I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Thins place is so good I love coming here for there coffees and there teas. It's quite enough that you can have a conversation and even (like me)  get some school work done and there pastries are good as well."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, fresh in-house made pastries and treats, good place to sit and study or enjoy a chat with friends. Only complaint, wish it was open until 10:30 or 11pm. Always people still in there when they close and this neighborhood needs a place that stays open a bit later that is not fastfood."}
{"text":"The chai latte is superb! Great ambiance, the music is always just right. Tasty pastries and parfaits."}
{"text":"So I have made this my new place on my way to work. Today being my 6th time in. First you have to understand that for a profession I am a designer of business protocols . One of which this one is missing on many levels. Each of the six times I have come in my wait in line is less than 1 min , fantastic .. Here comes the buts.. For some reason the staff finds it very difficult to make any eye contact or have any desire to stop talking to there other team members about there own personal lives. I have had to refrain from the casual UM Hum 3 of the six times in. I don't think I'm being critical. Maybe this is the model that they are trying to achieve . Drip coffee is on point . Music is at a perfect volume . I will continue making this my morning haunt."}
{"text":"What's great about Echo Coffee is it seems to be on the way to everything - to work, back home, to events. The convenient location and quick service means I can get in, get goodies and get out. When I do have the time to sit, the easy access to power and wifi makes for a great workspace.

My must try list? Organic lemonade, mocha (great for those that don't like a strong taste of coffee, but love chocolate) and the chocolate-chip cookies."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!  Great coffee with fast and friendly service.  The music and ambiance is also very nice."}
{"text":"Local taste is always the best, great vibe for first date, studying, or just to relax away from home. Echo has the couches and the ambiance to do so. The shall cups of coffee are really small so carefully look at cup sizes"}
{"text":"I can only review this place after a brief stop in for an iced coffee. The iced coffee was delicious - one of the best I've had. It probably was good enough to drink black without any soy milk or sweetener, but I always add them in out of habit. The young woman who took my order wasn't really the most friendly but at least she got the job done and my coffee was ready pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Visiting echo coffee for the first time today was a very pleasant experience. The expert craftsmanship of the Batista's working there produced by far the best tasting Americano I have ever had the good fortune to taste. The coffee bar itself is fresh, clean, spacious, furnished well and smartly decorated. I would definitely recommend echo coffee to anyone and everyone who loves americano's."}
{"text":"Best latte ever!!!  I missed my local coffee shop in Phoenix and I stumbled upon Echo.  I am so happy I found this place.  Free Wi-fi and AMAZING lattes have won me over!  I recommend the Turkey & Brie sandwich.  The pear made the sandwich.  They have a great music selection and they don't crank up the volume.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Watched the Ignite Phoenix #7 viewing party here on Friday Night. Thanks for hosting.  Had a lovely Americano while I watched.  Great drinks and cool interior.  The other guests seems to be talking about their food as being very good.  This is a little out of my neighborhood so don't know how often I will be able to stop by, but if I am ever remotely close and need a little java, this is a great little spot."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee spots in Scottsdale!  Great service, great coffee and they serve almond milk-the kind that comes from the fridge not a nasty hot box."}
{"text":"The coffee is always delicious and well made. They have a variety of milk options which is a plus. The baristas are always helpful and give some great recommendations. They have multiple pastry options that cater to those who want to indulge in sweetness or want a slightly healthier version of muffins. Just wish they had a drive thru!"}
{"text":"The baked goods are very good,  coffee is good to very good (depending on whose behind the machine), the service is a fail.  Unless the owner is there or the young man whose typically around after 3, expect to be served by two sullen and/or supercilious pseudo-divas behind the counter.  They are a testament to their generation and a good reason not to make a great coffeehouse a habit."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee. Comfortable seating and free wifi. Prices are the same as Starbucks but it's a local business which helps keep money in the valley. Meets all my needs!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee.  Good atmosphere; not great but good.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  Free WiFi which makes getting word done easy."}
{"text":"Pour over was good. I gave 3 stars for this place for  several reasons. First, the lack of pastries / breakfast items besides bagels. Second, no toaster available for the bagel. Third, the barista wasn't friendly."}
{"text":"I love Echo's coffee so much better than Starbucks or Coffee Bean. It just tastes better."}
{"text":"I got to eat a very tasty little shortbread cookie that was served with my cappuccino. I tried the cappuccino here for a change as I always seem to order a latte and I wanted to try a slightly different flavor.

There is easy ordering at the register near the entrance.

Coffee pick up is very minimalist as they pass your coffee to you through a small gap beside the coffee machine.

Nice wall art. It represents a variety of different art genres.

There are quite a few tables both 2-person and one that will seat eight. There are also stools for working at a counter. Two comfortable sofas and one chair allow for a relaxing meeting area for friends.

I think one of the walls is painted a light avocado green which gives the coffee shop a retro feel. The ceiling is the usual silver exhaust pipes on a matte black background. Pink lighting gives off a warm tone.

Unfortunately, the five white buckets stored beside the coffee roaster detracts from the overall stylistic impression of the establishment(I assume they are temporary)."}
{"text":"Coffee is clearly the breakfast of champions. 

The classy looking building caught my eye driving down Thomas Road (which I often do) and I was excited to try it out the following morning. I was greeted with friendly service and contemporary decor. The area was littered with young professionals tapping away on laptops using the free wifi service (which earns them a star on it's own, IMO).

My vanilla soy latte was priced only slightly above average cost, which I am happy to pay to support local business.

The taste was great- not too sweet and a good, strong flavor. Here's the kicker though... As an avid coffee aficionado, I don't often get a caffeine \"buzz\" but this latte had me WIRED. Please don't take this as a bad thing- I miss that feeling and boy did I get a lot accomplished that morning! 

I'll be back, Echo Coffee!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find this cute coffee shop in Scottsdale before heading back to CA. Echo Coffee is located in a small plaza with its own parking lot, so parking wasn't a hassle at all! 

I personally loved the ambience of Echo Coffee. It's very similar to the more \"hipster\" coffee shops in LA. You can tell that they're serious about their coffee! Their decorations revolve around coffee, and they also have a ton of artwork featuring local artists that customers can buy if they find a piece that sits well with them. 

I ended up only ordering a large iced latte, but it was worth the price! The latte was in a decent sized cup for the price I paid. (Large is $4.50 and regular is $4.) Coffee taste was strong and pretty smooth, although it was a tiny bit on the bitter side for me - which was perfect for my dad. I think it could have been a touch sweeter, but that's just me. Seeing all the pictures of the pretty latte art, I definitely wish I could have gotten the drink for in-store rather than to-go. 

The pastries and baked goods looked fairly decent. There's lots of sofas for people to relax on as well as tables and chairs for studying. There was a good number of people that occupied the place on a weekday morning, so that's saying something! 

tl;dr - good place for some authentic coffee!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place - crowd, music and decor all work.  It's fairly busy and lots of WiFi activity.  The coffee is great.  I can recommend the the Carmel w/a bit of Vanilla Latte.  Yum.  By default they make it at drinking temperature (which Is about 120 from my experience) - so I could have slammed it in a couple seconds - its that good and ready.  Everything they use is Organic and they roast medium - you get all they flavor and caffeine in their preparation without a bitter after taste."}
{"text":"I came here to do some work on a Saturday morning. I ordered a regular latte, which tasted OK. It did not really have that delicious taste of coffee that I normally get when I order a latte at other coffeeshops. My order did come with a quarter sized shortbread cookie, which was fun, but not too tasty. 

The overall ambiance of Echo was ok. There was a decent amount of seating, though I did not see too many outlets around. Also, the baristas, who were not very inviting, were pretty loud throughout my time here, making it hard to really concentrate at some points.

All in all, I probably would not come back to Echo and would rather make a farther drive to a different coffeeshop."}
{"text":"Coffee roasted on site - Sunday afternoons. Good coffee, usually quiet atmosphere. very nice staff. sanwiches are a bit over priced, but taste good. Focus on the coffee and you will do well. Have gotten alot of work done here and have held many meetings outside."}
{"text":"I come here at least a few times a week the coffee is really good and tastes great. They have a regular staff that is very personable as well. If you like coffee shops and don't want to deal with the very loud ones around then this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"So I finally experienced Echo Coffee and I realized I should have been there many times before.  It is a great little coffee shop with patio seating and lots of places to relax inside as well.  They offer free Wi-Fi which is a plus.

I went during breakfast time so I had a blueberry scone which was good lot's of Blueberries and good flavor.  I also had a Caramel Latte which was very good.  They had great presentation as well in the foam.  

I will totally go back next time probably for lunch they had some great sandwich's on their menu."}
{"text":"Love independent coffee shops and this is a good one. Very nice staff and good coffee choices. Pretty good sweets too. Try it out. Only reason it's not 5 is the atmosphere could be a little better. It's nice but not top shelf"}
{"text":"Nice staff and good drinks.  Plenty of room to mix and mingle.  I wish they still had sandwiches but after all it is a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Coffee that repeats itself?

I can do that all by myself!

I just need to forget to take my Prilosec, and my morning cuppa Joe will \"repeat\" most of the day (is there much of anything more unpleasant than being on the receiving end of somebody else's coffee and onion bagel burps, complete with acid reflux \"grace notes\"?).

So I make sure that I take all my medications (when you get to be my age, you are pretty much at the mercy of the medical profession...I personally seem to be held together entirely by surgical grade Super Glue, titanium rods, Teflon inserts and a pharmacopeia of truly staggering proportion!).

Anyway, the match that lights this particular rocket every morning is coffee!

Sometimes I take my coffee at Echo (I have said it before and I will say it again...I really do not understand how some of these places get their names...what does sound reverberation have to do with coffee and the accompanying treats, breads, and what not...what?).

And a pretty decent cup of coffee it is...each cuppa, is individually drip brewed and served in a nice big ceramic mug...perfect for warming up on these chilly 80 degree autumn mornings!

According to Steve at Echo, they do not have muffins, croissant, bagels (no, not even onion bagels, ever) nor breakfast sandwiches to carb you up to face the day.

According to the message from Steve...they do have Blueberry Scones.

As anyone who has read my little stories will attest, accuracy in my recitation of menu items is of critical importance to me!

OK...

My visit's have been for coffee and I glanced at the bakery case (I was sure that I saw some of the above, but apparently not), but I don't really eat the pastries anyway.

I can only comment on the coffee and the place.

Echo is open and airy, nicely decorated and has lots of big communal workin'/eatin'/drinkin' tables to set up shop and while away the hours (you know, looking for work/writing your novel/surfing Hulu/updating your FB status like that's your job), until you have to go home and face reality (no internet, no cable, no power, no...well, just no).

Echo is convenient to me and easily found by pretty much everybody...Echo also has plenty of parking in the lot for their building (unlike so many of their coffee house brethren), so I take the occasional meeting at Echo.

Finally, a very nice aspect of Echo Coffee is that there is, in fact, no echo at Echo (unlike places like the Grand Lux)...I can actually hear my conversations at Echo!

Give Echo a try...they have decent coffee, at not terribly exorbitant prices, and Echo provides a reasonably comfortable place to have a conversation or just enjoy your coffee.

Echo is a pretty solid 3.666666666666666666666666666666666666 stars (oop's...my 6 key \"echoed\" a few times), and as always...no rounding up.

Thanks for the correction, Steve."}
{"text":"Swallowed my pride, as well as lunch at Echo... Man, was that tuna sandwich worth the wait. That's not a sentence I say more than like, once a decade.

Apricots, apple cider dressing, avocado... What would I do for a Klondike bar? Far fewer things than I would for this sandwich. Well done, Echo, I tip my hat to thee."}
{"text":"Solid, well rounded coffee shop. Echo has a super friendly atmosphere and caters to everyone. I love that they make all pastries in house, and they are awesome (and well priced!). One thing I love is that my wife and I can go to echo and both get something we prefer. They serve both classic dark, bold roasts as well as bright, flavorful single origin roasts that cater to coffee lovers like me.
They also have friendly service and good music (that isn't too loud)."}
{"text":"So I went here on Sunday morning for 'breakfast' (just coffee... ha) with the BF as part of the Coffee Tour of PHX....FTW. The shop is really cold feeling... not in temperature. It just doesn't have anything really cool about it and it doesn't have he warmth in the type of seating or the lighting... I dunno, not my style. The baristas were nice, but really slow. The BF got drip coffee, which I was not a huge fan of.... it had a weird flavor and even though there wasn't much cream in it, the cream flavor overtook the coffee flavor. I got my usual, a latte. It was ok, it tasted good but was not my favorite flavor. I guess that's personal preference, but I thought it was just ok. Also, the cups were kind of crappy... they were eco friendly, which is fine, but did not protect my hand very well from heat... not so pleasant. Anyway, this place is fine and it's better than starbucks for sure, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Echo coffee shop is everything I have ever dreamed of in a study spot. I order a hot almond milk latte (sometimes 2) each day when I study there. The atmosphere is mostly people doing work, which I love. The employees are friendly and prompt and deliver the latte to your table. Thanks for being great, Echo Coffee!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. They have great coffee! I love their lattes, both hot and cold. I wish they had more iced tea selections (only black), but it's seriously not even a big deal. They have plenty of hot tea options, though. They have great desserts--I recommend their cheesecake brownie! They also occasionally have salads and fruit parfaits for when you're doing some studying and need some fuel. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Very personable staff. Great coffee blends and awesome flavor. Restaurant was a little hot for my liking. Turn on the A/C for the love of Mike, we live in Arizona! Coffee was a little overpriced. Otherwise, really good local coffee."}
{"text":"Echo coffee spent way more money on their decor than they did their coffee beans. I stopped in one afternoon for a snack and afternoon java jolt. The espresso coffee was on par with illy, the brownie was clearly from a duncan hines box. I can pretty much get both of those at home. Bottom line: Why go here when Orange Table is around the corner and makes homemade goodies?"}
{"text":"The coffee was great but the price was steep at $30 for two coffees and two bagels (not even toasted or shmeared). A cool vibe and mixed crowd but I cant justify the cost."}
{"text":"If I lived a little closer, I'd always be here. I love the coffee here and the baked goods are always fresh and delicious. Perfect spot to recharge your batteries and reading or studying. Wi-fi is fast, just get the password at the cashier. Staff is not overly friendly like it used to be but still professional. The only problem is that it's always packed, sometimes you don't even find parking in the front. Other than that, it's one of the best coffee shops I've been to."}
{"text":"Great coffee..unpretentious..but great side orders..cheesecake or otherwise..been back several times."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in all of Phoenix. 

I really don't want to rave about them, because I want to be selfish and keep them to myself. 

First of all, the coffee, is delicious! Every drink and food item I have had there is awesome. 

However, it's really the ambiance of the place that I love! They have these ridiculously comfy couches and chairs that I love curling up in with a good book. The staff leaves you alone to do your own thing. It's never too crowded or too loud. Everything about it is just right for me!"}
{"text":"I totally 100% support all local businesses! Especially coffee shops.. I'm all for it! Great coffee  at this place. It was packed when we went. There were a lot of studious people with their books and laptops. I can see that this place would be conducive for that purpose."}
{"text":"A mixed bag.
For the amount of traffic this place gets, the inside is non-intuitive and orders get lost in the mix with a frequency that rivals the over priced $5 latte (which does not boast a flavor to match).

The staff is nice and seems genuinely interested in the art of roasting but their frequent gushing over the bitter science turns long lines into a snaking ouroborous that runs head first into the logistical problems mentioned above. 

A decent enough place but I doubt I'll come here a third time."}
{"text":"I am trying to stay away from the big chain coffee houses, so I thought I would revisit Echo. I had been here one other time when the restaurant was brand new. 

On that occasion the owner greeted me, told me the story of his coffee house, and generally made me feel warmly welcome. 

This time I walked in to the staff all looking at their phones.  I asked about one of the food items, and it was all I could do to get the person too busy on their phone to even look at the item I was inquiring about. 

I placed my order, (black coffee and a granola bar) and was given my food immediately. I went and found a place to sit and waited for them to bring my coffee as they were delivering drinks to other patrons. 

After several minutes I went back to the counter and asked about the status of my coffee.   The employee said \"here it is\", and produced it from the counter. It has obviously been sitting for a while as the coffee was lukewarm at best. 

Looks like they have a decent neighborhood clientele. The space is pretty dated however, and not real clean. 

Sorry for the poor review, and I hope mine is the exception, but this was not a positive experience"}
{"text":"Their pastries and coffee are delicious, but the atmosphere is a little lacking. While their coffee bar is cute and well-decorated, the rest of the room lacks character; the furnishings and art are like those found in the ASU library."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place to work in early morning and late evening. and very friendly staffs :)"}
{"text":"Prety good music, good coffee and good sandwich. The seating is plentiful, but the WIFI was a bit slow and dropped a few times. I am in IT and have solid gear so no it want my gear. I will be back and often."}
{"text":"Pros:  Free Wifi, lot's of outlets and seating

Cons: Pretentious, doesn't seem to be community friendly, not very welcoming

My experience began when the owner gave me a funny look for wanting flavor in my coffee.  I later overheard him telling a customer that a flavor masks the true taste of coffee.  Seemed a little pretentious to me.

The shop, while very large with lot's of seating, isn't very warm and inviting - both in terms of service and decor.  I felt like I had overstayed my welcome after working in the shop for a few hours (after buying food and coffee of course).

The shop owner also was also kind of putting down Mac owners right in front of me, as I was working on my mac.  

I asked if they had a place where community groups could put up posters about events, and was pretty instantly shot down.  I can understand not wanting to advertise all over your shop for other businesses, but to me it kind of goes against the grain of a local coffee shops to not support the community - I've seen more local flourish at a starbucks.

My advice - this is a fine place to get some coffee and get some work done.  But personally, I would definitely look for another coffee shop before coming back here."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time visiting this location and I absolutely love it! My fancy coffee was not only well decorated, it was also very tasty. Staffs are friendly and it has a relaxing seating area for my friend and I to spend almost 2 hours together. Most guests respect the quietness and I saw few people working on their laptops while they were there. I will most definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Great coffee in this little neighborhood joint! They offer free wifi which proves to be very popular with the student and professor crowd that hangs out here. They used to serve food at lunch hour and they made a mean grilled cheese sandwich but they stopped serving lunch last year which is the only reason I can't give this review 5 stars. You will see me at Echo grading papers and munching on one of their amazing bakery items-hope to see you here too!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Phoenix from the northwest so I was elated to find this gem! I  ordered a vanilla latte that was creamy and delicious. We also splurged for this chocolate coconut cake that was to die for. Free wifi is awesome and a really chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have a nice atmosphere and good coffee.  It is easy to get vegan coffees/ lattes.  They are starting to have some vegan baked goods, which is great!"}
{"text":"Until today, I thought I had at least heard about most cool coffee shops around town. I was wrong because I had never heard of Echo and just happened to drive by a few days ago. Today I decided to stop in and was pleasantly surprised. I can't judge a coffee shop by coffee because I have never had a coffee in my life....so I judge it by its ambiance and its Chai Tea Lattes!!!! Yes I said Chai. 
This place has an amazing Chai! and I like the unique feel of the place. It seems like its a neighborhood coffee shop stuck in a corporate-type building/possibly the wrong building for this place. But it was still pretty cool. I'd go back. 
(and the couch is amazing)"}
