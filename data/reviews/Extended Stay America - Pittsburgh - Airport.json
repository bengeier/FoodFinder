{"text":"As stated in the \"check in\": AVOID!
 
This place is low class from the front door to the rooftop. The staff is about as unfriendly as possible. They always make it seem like you are putting them out by having to do anything! The \"grab and go\" breakfast consist of granola bars, muffins, oatmeal and coffee (I would say hot chocolate; but, they ran out of that on my first morning and two weeks later had not restocked it.) They want you to grab one small muffin, one single granola bar, and a cup if coffee. That is not breakfast. You pay for breakfast; but, you are getting a snack. Housekeeping is done once a week (it appears that they make the bed and leave). On the weekend, however, they will barge in to see if you are still in the room. Seems simple enough...I did not check out, so, I'm still in the room! They offer basic meal/kitchen items. Both pans that I received had busted handles. I was given one each knife, fork, spoon, plate, bowl and a broken spatula. The toaster kept throwing the circuit and the coffee pot was disgusting.

Needless to say, if I had an option and my company had not paid in advance for this stay, I would have checked out after the first night!

So, remember.........AVOID!"}
{"text":"Affordable and that's all I can say. First room the bathroom door wouldn't close at all. I don't know about you, but I like to have a little privacy when I use the bathroom. The front desk seemed a little annoyed when I asked to switch rooms because maintenance wasn't available until the morning. The second room was right down the hall - completely smelled like smoke (in a non smoking room), rotting bananas and a cell phone cord were sitting on the table when we walked in - right next to the room has been inspected for cleanliness sign. Finally the third room is a charm. I'm happy the front desk was accommodating but housekeeping - you can do a better job. Oh and since we're only staying for 3 nights we're not eligible for housekeeping. Ugh! Not staying here again."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for at this cheap, mostly adequate suburban extended stay hotel:

The Bad:
- Wet dog smell (pet friendly)
- Big clump of long black hair on bathroom floor
- No shampoo or anything but a bar of soap in the room (shampoo is avail at desk). No hand dishsoap for dishes either
- Hard-as-a-rock bed killed my back

The Good:
- Relatively clean
- Room was \"bigger than (bf's) apartment\"
- Full size kitchen with pots and dishes for 3
- Good water pressure
- Walking distance to lots of restaurants and shopping and close to highways
- Free parking

Was it tolerable for one night? Yeah. Would I go back? Nooooo!"}
{"text":"Checked into the hotel. Went to go to bed and the bedding was filthy. Went to the front desk-they gave me all new bedding-which I had to change myself as no housekeeping staff was on duty. I emailed corporate and have not received a response. Pretty poor customer service. I don't expect a lot from these types of hotels, but a clean bed should not be an issue. I will not stay at this chain again."}
{"text":"For $40, I can't expect too much, right?  It's decent enough. Cleanish. Terrible lighting in the building, an affront to my delicate nature.  Mattress is super firm. Not bad for the price.  Just kinda 'meh'.

The more I process my night here, the more disgusted I am.  There were clumps of hair on the bathroom floor.  The mattress was like sleeping on cement.  The couch was stained. It smelled of wet dog.  Ech."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give it zero stars! Room spelled like recently smoked marijuana, headboard had mysterious splashes on it (posted pic), bedding had black human or dog hair in it, and I was disgusted enough to not take my shoes off, or unpack for fear my belongings would smell like the room! Worst hotel experience. Asked for a new room but told it was the last one. I cannot believe we paid $100 for this. I want my money refunded!  DO NOT STAY HERE EVER, no matter if closest hotels are sold out, driver further from airport, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Amazing front desk guy!
Fast painless check in
Friendly house keeping 
Little breakfast with good coffee and muffins
Huge spotlessly clean room with full kitchen and great living room area.
Across from a Plaza with a so so nail salon,  subway, and great Buffalo Wild wings.
Close to shopping and airport 
Let me check out late without any issues
Close to a great arcade for all ages"}
{"text":"Good value if you can get a room for under $70.  Spacious, clean room with a decent bathroom and a comfortable bed.  What more can you ask for?

The only negative is the elevator is extremely slow.  Will definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"\"No shampoo or anything but a bar of soap in the room (shampoo is avail at desk). No hand dishsoap for dishes either.\" Did someone really write that? Who travels to a motel and dosen't bring their own essentials? that is pretty hurtin especially when there is a walmart super center right next door.

Anyhow, the location is only ok and that is just cause the mexican place across the street is awesome. The girl at Subway is an idiot, said she did not know what I meant by, \" please put the cheese on top of the sandwich after everything is on it. \" And as we all know Buffalo wild Wings is awful."}
{"text":"The room itself was ok and the price was fair but even though we checked in on a Friday we were told that our room service wouldn't clean the room until the following Friday.  When it wasn't cleaned after a week, we notified the front desk.  After returning the next day it still wasn't cleaned and we received a note from the manager indicating it would be done the next day (yes...9 days uncleaned) BUT we were leaving the next day so that didn't help at all.  No discount or considerations were given as a result until I filed out the questionnaire presented to me via email.  The grab and go bfast was skeletal with only a muffin, fruit, granola bar and very weak coffee.  The night clerk was foreign and did not communicate well.  They initially charged my card well over the online quoted price but then gave me the quoted discount after the room charge...very confusing."}
{"text":"I stay in hotels frequently, and I'm really easy going about hotels... as long as the room is clean  there usually isn't much for me to get fired up about.  This particular Extended Stay property is my first experience with the franchise, and it is pretty much what I expected it to be.  The folks I dealt with were friendly enough. My room was clean, albeit very dark (yes, I had the lights on) the AC didn't really work and the decor outdated... but it was clean. First impressions of the property from the outside of the building is that it is pretty nice, but the inside is a bit dingy looking.  All in all for $80 there isn't much not to like... It is a better value than crappy Red Roof Inns at the same price (or better).  The place could probably use a face lift though, but oh well."}
