{"text":"I really enjoyed Zog Dogs!  It's simple, freshly made and very tasty!  I think the limited number of toping selections is a bonus.  In reality, there is only one acceptable topping for hot dogs, and that's mustard.  I ordered two \"Zog Dogs\"  with Stadium Mustard and a side of fries.  The dogs were delicious, natural casing, with just the perfect amount of.  The *snap* of the casing is something that's so hard to find in a restaurant hot dog these days.  The fries were crispy and salty.  Darn good dogs!"}
{"text":"Giving a bad review to Zog Dogs is like kicking a puppy.  You WANT to like them, because they've got a homey atmosphere that just begs to be loved; from the children's drawings on the walls to the hand-lettered menus to the friendly staff, the whole thing screams \"Family business, just trying to get by!\"  

But alas, I don't eat companionship.  (And if there's a restaurant that serves companionship, I refuse to participate in your cannibalism, sirrah.)  So what we get here are thoroughly mediocre hot dogs.  

There aren't a lot of toppings; ketchup, two kinds of mustard, chopped onions (not grilled), dill relish (no pickle relish), a handful of others.  Nothing you couldn't squeeze or chop yourself in little time.  The buns are straight from the Wonder Bread emporium.  The signature \"Zog Dogs\" (which are what I had) are thin, sausage-cased dogs that are hard to bite through, and not particularly filling.

I also had the chili cheese fries, which were traditionally Cleveland - a grayish chili with strange meat, doused in cheese from a can.  The fries were nicely soaked, though, I have to admit. 

I want to think that this is them working out the kinks, but my (queasy) gut tells me that this kind of hot dog is what they strive for.  Admittedly, The Perfect hot dog is a huge matter of contention - you may note that there are several burger chains, but only one half-hearted attempt at a national hot dog chain (and Nathan's is not, to my mind, particularly good either).  But even if I really wanted small, sausagey dogs, I'm afraid this wouldn't do it for me. 

But please.  Go there.  I like the people.  Just not the food."}
{"text":"I decided to stop into this little hot dog place for lunch today, and much to my surprise they offered a Polish Boy sandwich.

It had everything that a Polish Boy should have - kielbasa, cole slaw, frech fries, and BBQ sauce.  The BBQ sauce was a bit on the sweeter side and didn't have any spiciness to it, but that's a personal preference.  Thankfully, they have bottles of hot sauce on the tables to fix this.

The kielbasa was flavorful, and had a good bite to it.  The frech fries at first looked like they were Ore-Ida frozen fries, and they very well might have been, but they were fried to a crispy perfection.

All in all it was a good & fast lunch."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the previous review.  I really like Zog Dogs, so much that I have taken friends there.  I like the 'Zog Dog', it is a beef dog in a natural casing so it has more of a 'snap'.  They have a bunch of toppings, including the normal ones and some different ones, including tomato, slaw, and sauerkraut.  The owner Mary makes homemade potato salad which is very good as well.  Last time I was there they had started making funnel cake strips, which were also yummy.  The staff is nice and the place is super clean."}
