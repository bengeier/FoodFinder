{"text":"3 of my friends and I came to Malena on a busy Friday evening. Since the space isn't very large, I'd recommend making a reservation. The restaurant is located in a converted home and I loved its warm yet cozy atmosphere.

What we ordered:

Fritto Misto del Giorno  - House made mostarda & pickled cherry peppers sott'olio ($16). To be honest, simply reading the menu, I had no idea what this dish was. After quickly searching it up on Google, we discovered its translation was \"fried mixed day.\" Fried? Sold. This turned out to be a great starter - great for sharing! 

Grilled Ionian Octopus - Braised chickpeas, crispy onions & pancetta brodo. I thought the octopus itself was just okay (but I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of octopus in general). I also found the chickpeas to be a tad undercooked as they were still quite hard.

Nduja Sausage & Little Neck Clams - Ouzo & shallot brodo with crispy polenta ($16). The portion of this wasn't very large as it came with only five or six clams. However, they were well cooked and the sauce, which contained bits of minced sausage, had a bit of a kick to it and tasted quite nice. My favourite part of this dish was the crispy polenta, which actually came in the form of a polenta stick. I don't normally love polenta, but if it was always served this way, I'd enjoy it a lot more. 

Squid Ink Tortelloni with Lobster - Mascarpone, heirloom carrot & brown butter sauce ($28). The highlight of my evening. The portion wasn't very large, but the filling sure made up up for it.. The filling contained large chunks of lobster and the mascarpone filling with the brown butter sauce was incredible. 

Perth Farms Berkshire Pork - Grilled shoulder chop & confit belly with caramelized cauliflower ($29). Amazing. Perfectly cooked pork and a large piece of rich pork belly. Simply delicious. My only complaint was that the caramelized cauliflower was really oversalted.

A great Italian restaurant in the Yorkville area - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Malena, the new Avenue and Davenport darling, that took over the space of the Pink Pearl is a good addition to the the strip known for it's abundance of cheap flowers shops.  David Minicucci one of the owners is also co-owns it's neighbor, L'Unita, has menus inspired by Southern Italy and Greece with a focus on les fruits de mer (seafood).  Dimmed candlelight make this restaurant intimate and elegant without a pretentious air which is reflected in it's clientele it serves.  The customers are not the hipster urban types you see out on the town but more of a refined group of sophisticates

{"text":"OMG delicious seafood with Greek and Italian roots. good ambience. great service. a bit pricier than what i am used to but so worth it. has gotten rave reviews so necessary to make reservations."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. So happy we were able to get a reservation for the time we wanted because I LOVED this place, and I'm not biased because \"Malena\" is one of my favorite movies!!

The ambience is great, especially around the bar which is beautiful. Very classy and elegant. It is known as a seafood place, so I did try the squid ink chitarra which was really tasty and their mediterranean salad which was great. 

I really want to come back here and just sit by the bar!"}
{"text":"Definitely as good as a gets. A great cozy ambience especially on a cold night.  We were lucky to get special treatment from the sommelier because my husband imports Canadian wines and it made the night a real treat (we were the last patrons out). Hands down the most succulent lobster we have had (comparing that to Petros in Manhattan Beach, Kokkari in SF and a few other places--including Venice, Italy).  For the main, I had the squid ink chitarra & lobster which was phenomenal-a very elegant dish."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try out Malena for a while, and finally found the opportunity to do so on a Friday night. The dining room, tucked in century-old home, was small but elegantly homey. Our reservation was for 8:30 pm, and by this time, there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant that was already on the dessert course. We were both quite surprised about the emptiness given that it was a Friday night.

Soon after placing our orders, we were served two types of bread with olive oil- focaccia with fennel seeds and some sort of sourdough, I can't remember exactly. The focaccia was particularly excellent. It had an incredibly spongy texture, almost reminiscent of a sponge cake. It was so dense and satisfying, and the fennel seeds added such a lovely dimension.

Winter caesar salad ($14)- garlic sautéed kale, white anchovy, bacon, focaccia and cauliflower purée. I missed the usual crunch and lightness of the romaine lettuce. In comparison, the kale felt quite damp and heavy. The components that I did enjoy were the focaccia and cauliflower purée. But other than that, I didn't care for the salad.

Fior di latte mozzarella arancini ($15)- caramelized onions, aged balsamic and mustard seeds. They were delightfully crispy on the outside and hot and gooey on the inside. I also loved the pairing with the tangy balsamic and mustard seeds, and I wanted more of that.    

Fritto misto del giorno ($16)- the daily selection of fresh fried seafood and vegetables included calamari, oyster, and zucchini, with black olive tapenade and fresh lemon. I wasn't a great fan of the olive dip, but everything was so fresh and tasty that a squeeze of lemon was sufficient. My favourite component was (surprisingly) the fried zucchini!

Roasted 'sous vide' chicken ($25)-house made mostarda, potato purée and farm fresh egg yolk. The chicken was incredibly tender and juicy. There's nothing I hate more than dry and overcooked chicken, and in this case, the meat was cooked to perfection and the doneness was uniform throughout. On top of that, the potato purée was absolutely scrumptious. I have nothing but praise for this dish!

Apple pie cannoli ($10)-cinnamon mascarpone, candied pecans, apple caramel. I've never really liked cannoli all that much, but this version definitely won over me. The cinnamon mascarpone filling and the apple caramel really brought out flavours reminiscent of the apple pie, but the usual rich buttery crust is replaced by the fried pastry roll. I really enjoyed this refreshing take on a traditional dessert.

Dark chocolate smores torte ($10)- white chocolate crackers, honey marshmallow, and dark chocolate sauce. It was also visually stunning, and I couldn't wait to dig into it. I personally preferred my apple pie cannoli, though the smores torte was undeniably delicious as well. On the whole, I thought both desserts were fantastic!

With the exception of the salad, the meal was truly wonderful! My favourites were the \"sous vide\" chicken and the apple pie cannoli. But I still couldn't understand why the restaurant was so empty on a Friday night. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the meal, and I look forward to checking out their sister restaurant l'unità."}
