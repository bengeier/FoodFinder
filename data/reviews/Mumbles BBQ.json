{"text":"I enjoyed Mumbles Bbq restaurant in my visit to Madison In. The most of the food was good and the outdoor atmosphere was quaint but excellent. 

My family and I decided to give this place a try as we were looking for a local restaurant.  We took an outdoor table as the inside was kind of small and it was a beautiful night out.  The view of the Ohio River was awesome from our the cheap metal table we were sitting at.

There seemed to be only two employees working that night and we were the only ones there, the were very polite and social. The jukebox had a great selection of classics that we promptly took advantage of.  There was also a deck of cards in each of the indoor tables that we played with while waiting on our meal.

We ordered our food from a moderately short list of menu items, all of which were standard bbq items (pulled pork and chicken, brisket, etc.) The special that night was fried cod which was also ordered.  The wait was a little longer than expected but we didn't mind because of the cards, nice view, and wonderful music.

The pulled pork and chicken were good, not the best I've ever had, but good none the less. However, the fried cod was the best meal. It treated fresh and the portion was large.

Overall, my Mumbles experience was good food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We asked a man walking down the street where to eat and he recommended Mumbles BBQ.  I'm glad we listen to him.  Excellent beef brisket sandwich.  Perfect smoked flavor.  Good homemade chips."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ! I had the pulled pork with homemade chips. Service was excellent. Meat was smoked just right with light sauce. Just perfect! The chips were amazing! And it's right on the river so I recommend getting it to go and eating down by the water! I will definitely be visiting this place every time I go to Madison!"}
{"text":"Very subpar food!  We ordered the sample meat platter to go with two sides and it looked pathetic, very dry, small portion of meat. the green beans were like 1/4 cup. It took forever to get the food and it didn't have silverware in the bag. The girl working the front was sweet but the place in general needs a revamp!"}
{"text":"When searching for places to eat at locally on my second trip to Madison I looked into Mumbles. I was hesitant due to no reviews and I had reason to be so. After eating at this establishment, I don't recommend it. The service was horrible, the food was just ok (lacking in true BBQ flavor) and BBQ portions were small. The bun was far bigger than the Pulled Pork. They ran out of sweet tea, just to name one item. Also, they couldn't keep orders straight. At my table I received my food, of 3 people, last and only after I asked for my plate. Other tables also had issues with their service."}
{"text":"First time here. I had pulled pork bbq sandwich with home made chips. It was delicious. The chips were crisp and just right. The pulled pork was tender and served on a fresh bun. The bbq sauce was tangy, not hot, with a really great taste.  I look forward to coming back and eating outside enjoying the riverside view."}
{"text":"Food was good, had the brisket sandwich which was smoked just right. There was not a lot of BBQ sauce on the meat which is how I like it. I can put more if I want but cannot take it off. Nice atmosphere and beautiful view of the river while sitting outside on patio."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pork sandwiches with fries for my family $35 wow we felt robbed after we left my husband was still hungry! Wait staff was horrible no refill don't waste your money!"}
