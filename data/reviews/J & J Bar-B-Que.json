{"text":"I dropped by today for a quick lunch while in Kensington. The first thing that threw me off was the complex menu which didn't make it very easy to order a few things to try. I asked what they would recommend and the chef told me everything was really good, which didn't really help the decision making process if I'm honest.  I settled on a half pound of spare ribs and it (somehow) came to $12 including tax. I didn't question it at the time but looking at their website it should have been $9 plus tax which comes to $10.17. The chef did weigh the ribs before serving so perhaps it ended up being more than 1/2 lb, but it definitely didn't end up being a cheap lunch.  While the ordering system and menu wasn't the best, the food itself was AMAZING. I loved the peppery BBQ rub and the meat was fall off the bone tender. If you're ordering 1/2 lb of anything on the menu and intending to share it don't - the portions are quite small, at least for the spare ribs. Also, $12 for what amounts to three (admittedly very tasty) ribs is not the best from a value standpoint. I appreciate that good BBQ takes time and money, but I ended up having to grab something else from another restaurant afterwards.  Definitely the best BBQ I've had in Toronto in quite a while (with the possible exception of Barque) but some sort of sharing/combo BBQ plate would make it a lot easier to try a few different meats and share between two or three."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good raves about this place. So I went in grabbed 1 lb and little bit more of the brisket, had a taste it, it was plain and boring. It had a big burnt taste and no real spice/seasoning. Only thing that was good was the BBQ sauce.  P.S. I tried to give them the a second chance and third chance by going back on a day they were supposed to be \"Open\" for operation. But the two times i tried to go back they were closed and did not leave a sign at the door."}
{"text":"A new cowboy has come to the Kensington market corral. J&J BBQ is a Texas-style BBQ place new to the area but given that this place is delivering high quality barbecue, it would seem that this is NOT J&J's first rodeo.   The restaurant is simply decorated with a long table (no chairs) where you can stand and eat your grub. No pretence here. This is the kind of place where you can (as I did) unapologetically eat a meat-heavy meal for lunch and love it. They specialize in ribs and brisket. They carve out the meat by weight. If you're looking for a light lunch, 1/4 lb of brisket with a side might be sufficient. They also have brisket sandwiches and a delicious roasted turkey sandwich with avocado and tomato that was flavourful and by no means dry.    My eyes were hungrier than my stomach so I ended up getting 1/2 pound of brisket and a side of slaw ($16). I ate and still ended up taking the other half to eat for lunch the next day. The brisket was moist and glistening near the fatty edge. I like that they have lots of condiments to eat with your meat, as well as slices of complimentary white bread to eat your meat with for a DIY sandwich.   I will definitely be back to try their Mac and cheese stuffed sausage as well as their ribs and banana pudding."}
{"text":"J and J just recently opened in the Kensington Market area. They specialize in authentic Texas style barbecue. My mom and I were in Kensington this past Pedestrian Sunday and we decided to check this brand new place out. I've never tried Texas style BBQ before, so this review is based on someone who has very little experience with this cuisine.  The place is clean, but it's on the small-ish side. The walls are covered with a floral pattern, and there are literally no chairs, just tables. It's a standing only place, so be aware of that if you plan on coming.  My mom ordered the combo with beef brisket and mine was the combo with the sausage. Both were very good. Both came with pickles, onions, and white bread. We also got coleslaw and potato salad. The brisket was well cooked, and the sausage was crisp on the outside and soft/meaty on the inside.  Overall, it's worth coming if you have a craving for good ol' American bbq, and/or if you're walking around the area and want a full meal.  Hope this place does well, it's a cool addition to the neighbourhood :)"}
{"text":"Great brisket. This place succeeds where others only pretend. They also do turkey, sausage, and a good selection of side items. Banana pudding is 4$.  My five stars are solely for the food. After many attempts to find great BBQ, J and J knocks it out of the park.  While the food is great, you should note...  1. There are no stools. You can eat in, but doing so requires that you stand. This kind of sucks.  2. You must go into the restaurant and up to the counter to see the prices. Brisket is 14$ per half pound. (They don't have an easy to compute pricing scheme, such as a BBQ plate and two sides for 17$) This, coupled with one side and a fountain drink will run you over 22$, not a bargain at lunch. Try to ask for less than a 1/2 pound (perhaps a 1/4) and opt for a cup of water to keep the price down."}
{"text":"This was soooo good.  We ate: - 1lbs of Ribs (5/5): Delicious. Want to try the chicken next! - Corn bread (2/5): I am NO expert on corn bread, but I found this to be quite textured and dry, but that might be a personal preference. - Slaw (2/5): It was okay. - Complimentary sauces, pickles, and onions (5/5): EAT THIS  So overall, I would totally go back for some BBQ and sauce."}
{"text":"Sandwich of the day was Pork Loin & Brisket. Really tender. I would skip the cheddar next time and put hot sauce or mustard.   Ordered a piece of spare rib had a dash of a sweet rub, really flavourful. Meat could be more tender compared to the ones I've tried in the past (Adamsons, Mud, Big Crow).   It's a small space, and ventilation isn't great in those old buildings in Kensington so probably opt to order for take out going forward."}
{"text":"Tried the brisket and both the hot guts and mac n cheese sausages, corn bread and biscuits. Brisket is fall apart tender and juicy sausages are very tasty. Although I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce, theirs is good. A little pricy for what we picked up but we have lots of leftovers for another meal. Disappointed the smoked cabbage was not available. Not sure if it was sold out (opens at 11 picked up food at 12:30). We will definitely try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"J&J Bar-B-Cue is a newly established Kensington Market smokehouse that is bound to become a hot ticket sooner than later. The co-owners - Jay and Jon - are passionate about the traditions of Texas-style BBQ and it shows the moment you walk through the front door.  A 1/2 lb of spare ribs ($7) is a good deal, as the meat is seasoned nicely. It won't fall right off the bone but is the right kind of chewy. They do their cooking on a white oak-burning offset cooker outside in the backyard. Turkey and brisket are also good choices to start with. Classic sides like beans and slaw can be ordered on the side.  Sandwich options are also available, which include: chopped brisket with bacon, cheese and jalapeños on a danish ($12), and smoked roast beef dip on a pretzel bun ($12). The sandwich menu seems to be switched up, on occasion.  Must-try items: Turkey/Brisket/Ribs Potato Salad Mac & Chz Sausage Big Red Cream Soda  The list of mouth pleasers doesn't stop there, though. You can also grab other treats like banana pudding, cheddar jalapeño cornbread, pecan pralines, pretzel fluff bars, for a few extra bucks. Mains, sides and desserts can be mixed together for an interesting meal on every visit. Get here early, because the shop closes once the food is sold out.  Hip-hop heads will enjoy the nostalgic blend of tunes playing softly in the background. The decorations and complimentary self-serve condiments (all the water, bread and pickles you ever needed) give customers a home-like feel, along with the kick-ass friendly service. It's standing room only here, but there are large enough tables to accommodate plenty BBQ lovers comfortably. J&J has instantly become one of my go-to places for grub."}
{"text":"J & J, I like you. My American husband says you're legit, and I think you're delicious, so that's enough to get me coming back again and again. I love your smokey smell, spicy sauces and rolls of paper towel to help me keep it neat. I enjoyed every part of my lunch, especially the imported cream soda I washed it down with, Big Red.  A little warning for your wallet: If you're kinda terrible at figuring out weight of meat and dollars as it relates to this, don't go for the beef ribs. Though they were perfect, my friend and I ended up splitting a $75 dollar lunch."}
