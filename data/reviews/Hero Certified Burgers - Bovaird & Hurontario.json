{"text":"I had th turky fiesta which was delicious.  The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars is that the fries are too soggy for my liking.  Not sure if that's the way they're intended to be.  My first experience with Hero Burgers was at Sherway Gardens and their fries were nice and crispy each time I had them.  I likely won't be as frequent a guest as I otherwise would be if the fries were crispier,"}
{"text":"For those who have never eaten a burger other than artificial beef of mcDonalds and Burger king will never be able to know what a good beef burger tastes like. The answer is Hero Burger. 
If you are here, might as well drop the dieting dumbness and go all the way! I tried their double patty beef burger with hero sauce- it was amazing. The poutine was not as good as they say it is. But you are here for the real deal and go for the beef burger. Experiment around with the sauces but for the beef it self and the freshness, i give them 5 star. 
And everything is HALAL except the turkey! 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a fresh angus burger but instead got a burger that tasted frozen and tasteless."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome! The staff were attentive and very positive and were handing out promotional coupons.. walked my order over to the table I was waiting at for my takeout. I went all the way home and opened the bag to find out they gave me someone else's (it tasted like a veggie burger, but could be wrong) order. 
I feel bad for whoever got my order of a beef burger if they are vegetarian.. But seriously wow.. I paid extra for sweet potato fries as well.. not impressed."}
{"text":"Ate here early January 2015. I ordered the lobster burger. I wasn't impressed with the burger patty (I prefer the works beef patty). What surprised me the most, was the burger was topped with a chilled lobster salad infused with mayonaise, in some areas it was nearly frozen which really took away from the burger experience. In fact, I did not finish the burger.  I would rather have a lobster salad sandwich, so the two wonderful ingredients aren't competing. 

My husband on the other hand, claims its the best burger joint in town. He ordered an 8 ounce beef burger and pounded on every topping they suggested, such as turkey bacon, guacamole, fried egg, fancy cheese and peameal bacon to boot! He loved it!!!

I found the physical restaurant to be cold in temperature, which threw me off, I had to sit with my jacket on to eat.  The new coke dispensing machine was really cool and had lots of drink options. Overall our lunch of two burgers, fries, onion rings and drinks  (pop not beer) came to $40. Seems expensive for not including any cold ones. If I wanted to impress a girl on a date of how many burger toppings I can afford to eat, than would pick this place."}
{"text":"My go-to burger joint. Representing the GTA in sponsoring the Leafs and Raps, you can feel good about your sports teams while devouring your juicy burger. Now to the food. With a plethora of options, Hero burger will never be boring. The burgers are flavourful, the toppings compliment the no-hormone beef, and the buns are fresh and unique. The fries are lacking, this isn't the place for great fries. However, their Coca-Cola freestyle drink machine allows for thousands of drink options and customization. Service is friendly, I know two of the cashiers by name (Amber and Mona). Hero Burger is an awesome burger joint inside and outside Brampton."}
{"text":"Hero Certified Burgers is one of the latest trends in the quick serve segment. Conceptwise, branding and food offerings gives it 2 thumbs up. Today I ordered 2 Soul (veggie ) burgers with  regular poutine and 2 drinks. The burgers were pretty standard veggie burgers with that similar taste. The poutine came with their non-beef gravy, cheese curds and not so crisp fries. The cheese melted and a 1000 strings of cheese were born! The Coca Cola freestyle machine failed 3 times when I tried to get Barqs root beer.  Each time I had to wait for the computer to be reset. This was a bit frustrating but, the staff were quick to remedy the issue. 
I would recommend this burger place because there are numerous flavor choices for any palate."}
{"text":"Was terribly disappointed with the burger and fries. Perhaps I'm a bit of a burger snob but when I read about a burger being 100% Angus beef, free range, grain fed etc etc, I'm not expecting a tasteless frozen patty. The fries also tasted like frozen fries that were cooked in the oven. Soggy and not fresh.  *Hightlight-Cherry Vanilla Mr. Pibbs zero. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Warm smiling faces and attentive service and quality recommendations. I ordered the blue moon burger but in a value size as I wasn't overly hungry"}
{"text":"Oddly enough, between the fries, burgers and onion rings, I find the onion rings are the tastiest item at this location.

The burgers seem greasier than I recall at a Toronto location."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The meals were much rather pricey for my liking, however I was here with a friend who decided we should try it and see how it goes.

I ordered the fish burger, i cant for the life of me remember what it was called but I ended up throwing it away because the bun got really soggy and I realized I shouldnt be using a knife and fork to eat a burger.

However, one of their poutines my friend bought was pretty good, not the greatest thing I've waten but still good nonetheless.

Would I come here again? Probably not, would I recommend the place? Depends on what everyone feels like eating."}
{"text":"In my one and only visit to Hero Certified Burgers I was thoroughly unimpressed. The interesting name had me curious but I found the burgers bland and lacking any real flavor. For a place wanting to compete in the premium burger space my visit was flat and boring. Maybe another chance is due at some point, but nothing is driving me back."}
{"text":"Customer Service here is great, the new owner really knows how to deal with customers and listen.

Food quality and taste is up to standards with other Hero restaurants.

Customer service goes along way in wanting customers to return."}
{"text":"When my family and I crave a burger near by, it's a toss up between this place or 5 guys (across the street).  I prefer this place because you can get a baby burger, under $5 and it's still filling.  It's their 4 oz burger.

Sometimes I order it with blue cheese, but then it can get too overpowering, because they put a lot.  I guess that's a good thing for some.

It's pricey, compared to Harveys but of course, the taste it not comparable.  The patty is just so juicy.  It shows on the menu that they'll charge you extra if you get a sauce as your dipping sauce.  I've never been charged, for all the times that I've been to a hero burger.  When I ask for the sauce, I ask to have it on the side.  Maybe it's a smaller container than a regular sauce for dipping?

For this location, it's usually clean or there's someone already cleaning it.  The staff has been very friendly to us every time we go there."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Best burgers in town. Filling and satisfying. Also the service was amazing. Great customer service and will always go back for more. Thanks Hero burger for being my hero last night! Lol xo"}
{"text":"If you want to feel less guilty about having a burger this will work. Burgers are good, nothing overly special but if you are a fan of pop or soda then their soda machine will make you feel like a kid again. Many flavours to choose from, some I didn't even know existed and you can mix flavours too!"}
{"text":"Especially for fast food like this it's a really great burger. The onion rings are real onion rings classic old style. The service is great. And you can even get a pretty good milkshake.  Great value for the money 
... tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"How excited I was to see Hero Burger come to Brampton! There are not many places that offer a gluten free burger with a bun that actually tastes like bread, and not spongy, crumbly foam. If you are gluten free, you are likely craving a burger. Always. You see, we always want what we can't have! So thank you Hero burger. Thank you for coming to Brampton! 

Now for the downside. The only real gluten free menu is the burger & bun (yay!). The fries on the other hand share a fryer with the onion rings, so they are not gfree. Sadness. For what is a burger without fries? 
It's great to see a sign that actually dictates what is gfree, especially in terms of toppings! The coca-cola machine is also cool with 100+ drink combinations, but you will probably find a line up, because with so many options (and many completely new options to us), people stand there for ages testing out drinks and combinations before they realize 10 people are behind them. 

Price is a bit much for a burger, but pretty spot on when you figure in the quality of the ingredients :)"}
