{"text":"What a find! My friend reserved this restaurant to celebrate her birthday. It is an absolute marvel. The decor inside, Middle Eastern look and feel. There is spot where you can wear the jacket/shawl with hat; to look like a Jordanians, and with the decorated background, we can take pictures. We had a lot of fun with it! 

The service was was excellent. Everyone is super friendly, helpful and patient with such a big group. 

My side of the table decided to order 1kg grilled meat. So we got kafta Kababs, shish taouks, filet mignons, fries, rice, grilled onions, tomatoes, taboule salad, hummus and pita. It was Food for 4 people. It was so delicious that there are no words to describe. For desert, watermelon was served and it was included. For all these food, divided by 4 people was 15$ each. Unbelievable! 

Here is the special surprise, I asked for a cake and candle for my friend, since it's her bday celebration... they did bring the cake but also the played the Happy Birthday song over the stereo, the whole restaurant knew it's her bday.... that was perfect.

It's an amazing restaurant; excellent food, beautiful decor, and lovely service... it is a must!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant that offers you delicious traditional Mediterranean food. The service was amazing, the cook came out to greet us and offer us some fresh falafel he had just cooked up that were delicious. I ordered the shawarma sandwich and some kebbeh and it was amazing and very Home made. I managed to try the hummus and garlic sauce and they were delish! At the end of our meal we had the chance to try some delicious deserts made fresh to order. I really recommend this place. I see myself becoming a regular."}

{"text":"We just crossed by this restaurant and saw the decoration out of the window. It was very original and attractive so we got in.

The place is very nice and the grilled mixed plate is one of the best I tasted in Montreal. The hummus and mtabal eggplant is so delicious. 

They offered us jus and dessert as well. Simply, I suggest that you try it when you are in downtown. 

Family friendly and they have a corner yo take photos on a traditional background with a water fountain."}
