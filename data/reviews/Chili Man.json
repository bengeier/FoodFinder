{"text":"Seldom in life do things live up to the hype.  Chili Man's hot dog cart blows the hype out of the water.  

The wait was a bit long but every dog is finely crafted.  Yes I used the term finely crafted for a hot dog! It's worth every second though when you take that first bite.  The wait goes by quickly listening to the Chili Man talk and entertain.  

You can't get a better experience for only 3 bucks a dog!

Lifechanger and backside burner! Do it!

Edit to add: Follow him on facebook at Vic the chili man for information on when he's open.  This would have helped me the three other times I went out looking for his cart!"}
{"text":"the BEST BEST hotdogs!! If you havent tried chili mans hotdogs or even met the chili man, well im sorry you are missing out. 5stars no doubt!"}
{"text":"I LOVE these hotdogs! Super inexpensive, and super satisfying! What more could you want?"}
{"text":"There's a reason the locals in uptown Charlotte are willing to wait in line at a hot dog cart for 30 minutes during their lunch hour - Vic the Chili man's hot dog creations are the best you will ever have. You'll not only love the food, but you'll also love the lively banter as Vic makes the wait in line an entertaining experience with his stories.  Must try if you find yourself in Charlotte."}
{"text":"BEST HOT DOG IN MY LIFE.   Very clean and gives you a good laugh as well.   I can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"After coming here for the first time last Wednesday, I've already been back 3 times. It is far and away the best hotdog you will ever eat in your entire damn life. If you go here, don't play it safe, be sure to try one of Vic's crazy creations like the Frito Pie dog or his weekly special- they are absolutely killer. Insanely good hotdogs, insanely good company, you owe it to yourself to make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Glad to see you back! Still the best hit dog in Charlotte. Arrive early and expect to wait 15-20 mins but well worth it. Try his unique sauces for a twist in the traditional Chilli dog. He also has a vegan dog if that's what you prefer. Everyone has their favorite so I will not offer suggestions. I would recommend that you go off menu"}
{"text":"It has been a few years & I MUST HAVE another dog from Vic!  Where are you hanging out these days?  I'm coming uptown just to find you."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in uptown area, the chilli dog was awesome. Ask him to make it spicy and you will be like wow! The vendor was also very kind and friendly, I recommend chilli man...."}
{"text":"MUST MUST MUST!!! Seriously, the best chili-topped hot dog I've ever had.  This is not your typical street hotdog!  Vic is an absolute pleasure to talk to.  This is a man who found his calling in life."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dogs and hot dog purchasing experience I've ever had.
Vic's charisma and passion for what he does is instantly apparent and much appreciated.
The Man, The Meat, The Legend."}
{"text":"Alright, seriously! I'm from NY. Land of the famous \"dirty water dog\" and didn't think anything could match up to that. Well, I was wrong. The dogs were amazing and Chili man definitely lived up to his name. Wow."}
{"text":"Long time eater, first time reviewer.  And what better way to start my first review than with the best lunch in town.  Note I said best lunch, not best chili dog or street vendor.  Everything Vic serves is top notch, starting with the buns, to the dogs, to the condiments (especially the spicy mustard and ketchup he makes himself), to the toppings.  But the real star of the show is the chili.  We're not talking browned meat with a little sauce here.  We're talking about chili that is loaded with meat, beans, spices, and flavor.  Chili that travels the region and wins prizes at festivals.  Chili that has been crafted and refined over a lifetime.  Chili that will make you slap your mama!

But wait, there's more!  You don't just get a great meal, you'll get entertainment, too.  Vic is a heck of a personable guy, and none to shy.  Depending on the time of day the line can grow a little long.  But it's always well worth the wait, and Vic's hospitality will make the time fly by.  So treat yourself when you are downtown.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"One of my colleagues told me I \"had to\" try the Chili Man's dogs.  So today I did.  

FANTASTIC!  I had what I think he called the Chili Man's Special and a Q-Dog.  The former had delicious homemade chili (thick, meaty, spicy, tasty with beans) and a delicious spicy mustard.  The latter had homemade BBQ sauce, tasty coleslaw, onions and perhaps some cheese.  Can't remember for sure.  Both were incredibly good.  I'll not forget that chili any time soon, and I'll be back for more.  Everything was top quality -- buns, dogs and condiments.

And, as others have mentioned, the Chili Man has a way with people.  Very engaging guy.  I love to patronize businesses like this."}
{"text":"I don't even really like hot dogs and this thing was amazing.  I had low to medium expectations - was really just in a hurry and it exceeded expectations by a mile.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I discovered Chili man 2 years ago from some of my colleagues and it has turned into my go-to for lunch 1-2x a week since. Besides the amazing wieners with combinations of toppings galore, Chili man provides a much needed break from the grind of the day. Sometimes the line can take 30-40min at peak times but you will be entertained by Vic the entire time with his color commentary. Follow him on facebook to keep up with the special creations he comes up with on a weekly basis.
 Oh did I mention it's the best hotdog in town, period!"}
{"text":"He said I'd be dreaming about his dogs later. I ate 2 and wanted 5 more. This dude is legit."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue since the first time I devoured a hot dog from the. \"Chili man\" i was pregnant with my now 3 yr old. It is amazing.. Now stop.. Wait in line... And enjoy..."}
{"text":"Vic, aka \"the Chili Man\" has been serving hot dogs out of a mobile hot dog stand for almost 3 years now. While we've seen a lot of mobile vendors appearing downtown in that time, none of them come close to the Chili Man in terms of quality or taste.

He's not called \"the Chili Man\" for nothing. His homemade chili is award-winning stuff, garnering prizes at multiple local and state chili cook-offs. It's so good you could eat it by the gallon. (And if you let him know in advance, he'll sell you a gallon so you can give it a try.)

Vic toasts his buns, uses high-quality dogs, and also makes his own spicy mustard. He has all the toppings you could want, including slaw, cheese, and kraut. He even makes a great chicken salad that you can get on a croissant. (Not available every day.)

On top of all that, he's got a great personality and is a blast to talk to while he's making your dogs. He's only there from 11-3pm on Wednesdays and Fridays, so you need to plan ahead.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and proclaim this the best dog in Charlotte. Seriously."}
{"text":"So I FINALLY made it to the Chili Man...I was underwhelmed to say the least. It's not bad, meh', but it's not something that I MUST add to my quick bite rotation either.  Vic, the owner is friendly, fast, and engaging.  He's very creative in his spin on hot dogs, but the fixin's are \"out of the box\" ordinary.  I was expecting a delicious home-made chili, and sauerkraut...DENIED!  The kraut was out of the bag and the chili (tasted out of the can) had beans in it...YUCK!! I was expecting SO much more.  I didn't try one of his sauce varieties because I didn't want my taste buds to be confused.  I'll say if you want a creative dog, stop by!  If you want a dog with a little more \"soul\", go to the stand outside of Little Hardware Store down the road..."}
{"text":"I remember last year when someone joked about leaving a 4-star review for Chili Man. The typical jovial light fell from Vic's eyes as he stared down the errant patron. His throat uttered an inhuman growl, with the clearly discernible words \"I will cut you\" flowing forth from his lips.

Oh wait, that guy may have been me. It'd be really brave and edgy to give these chili dogs 4-stars to break the hot streak, but at the end of the day it'd be just incorrect. Regardless of threats of bodily harm (not serious in case you're wondering) the ratings are here for a reason.

I won't repeat too much of what other people have said, but it's pretty crazy that Vic's been able to elevate tube meat to this level of an art form. However I will say some things that are important to note before you decide to try a dog:

* There are non-spicy options that are sublime, but I do believe that in general the spicy options are your best bet.
* Because of the large amount of ingredients and his mouth, if there's a line there will also be a wait. Expect about 4 minutes per person in front of you. I consider it worth it when there's  less than 6 people in front. Please don't be the guy who orders 10  dogs for the office. Get them to come with you outside.
* This is a street dog. It's served from a grandfathered in open hot dog cart. Vic wears gloves most the time and uses hand sanitizer. If you're expecting clean-room food... first why are you getting a hot dog, and second this place isn't for you. HOWEVER let me be clear - I've probably eaten at least 50 hot dogs from here (oh god) and have never seen or experienced anything untoward in regards to food safety. Just an FYI.
* If you want to know of specials, locations, and if Vic's even gonna be out on the street, you should check FB."}
{"text":"First time there! Well worth the wait. Best hot dogs I have ever had... Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I have had several amazing dogs from the chilli man. He is a true hot dog hero. My most recent dog, the chicken parm with pesto, was an absolute masterpiece. He has amazing prices for uptown food. He's like the soda machine with last decade's prices."}
{"text":"Great dogs, great dude! If you have not tried.....stop what your doing...right now...and go find Vic the chili man! Best hotdogs in CLT!"}
{"text":"This guy is the man. Its very obvious he is passionate about what he does, and the food is better because of it. I went with a classic bratwurst and spicy mustard, and hot damn, was I impressed. Not only was the food fantastic, but he is quite the personality as well. Youll never eat better at a food cart. His sauces are the bomb. What else is there to say? Skip the other over priced DT resteraunts and hit up the chili man on Tryon St. on your next lunch break, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC hot dogs!!! Thee Best hot dogs in Charlotte.  Life Changer and Frito Pie can't be beat.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants something special in Charlotte.  Then once you're hooked on the hot dogs,  He has a line of sauces.  CRAZY GOOD!!!  they can be served on the rocks or straight up.  I'm drooling right now thinking about it and I already had his hot dogs twice this week...its Wednesday and he doesn't work on Monday.  :)  go see this guy!!"}
{"text":"Best chili I've had from a vender. Have to get there when he opens or you'll stand in line for a bit. I can lookout my office window and check when I need to go. This is a must try."}
{"text":"So I am so happy that I chose to forfeit my salad and join some fellow Yelpers in finally grabbing one of the Chili Man's dogs. Man.....it's obvious why he is one of the best rated \"restaurants\" in Charlotte.

Vic the Chili Man operates out of a cart with an umbrella. It's typically set up in Uptown a little down from Trade and Tryon. Honestly, if he is there, you can't miss it cause there will be a line. Wait in said line, it's worth it.

Vic is a pretty cool guy. I couldn't help but crack a smile while he was talking and entertaining us while we waited. He makes each dog perfectly, including even toasting the buns. I mean, who does that?!?

I ordered the specialty dog of the day, the Stupid Black Garlic Dog (I only got one cause I had eaten have of salad mentioned above). The dog had a black bean chili, brie, some black garlic sauce of deliciousness. Heck, there could have been something else on there. I dont know. It was just amazing. I mean, it was a Guy Fieri style of bending over so you don't get your shirt messy while eating this amazingness of a hot dog. This dog was $3.50 too!!

Vic is the real deal."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in Charlotte. Vic makes everything from scratch and it's always amazing. Try \"the life changer\""}
{"text":"Simply the best.  Vic is \"Top Dog\" for street food and restaurants in general.  Such creativity for a hot dog is hard to find and the long lines prove it.  Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love him last year when he will come around . He is never there for long and sometimes you will not see him for day ... But when he comes around oh man .... His hotdogs are so good and if you don't eat pork he has all beef hotdog. The chilli is homemade by him and you can't taste it .. You not only limited to slaw , he has so much toppings. I hope to see him this summer ."}
{"text":"For the last 18 months that I've been traveling down to Charlotte, I've been walking past this guy, dubbed \"Chili Man\" and his cart, off Tryon.  On my last week traveling down to the Queen City, my colleague and I were on our way to the usual Dean and Deluca lunch when I spotted the Chili Man and thought - dude, if I don't try the top rated Yelp \"restaurant\" before I leave this place I'm not a real Yelper.  

My colleague is vegetarian, and the Chili Man has veggie dogs and veggie chili (sometimes!).  

I got the two chili dog combo with chips and a soda for $7.75 - great bang for your buck.  I went with the Vinegar bomb and the Life Changer.  Best damn chili dogs I've had.  The vinegar bomb has some of my favorite hot dog stuffs - chili, sauerkraut, pickles, and pickled jalapenos.  Those who love your sour veggies would love this.  The Life Changer was pretty life changing indeed.  I'm a spice lover and this did not disappoint.  The addition of the \"fried cheese\" sounded weird, but made for a delicious combo.  I'd get both of these again.

I'd also like to make a note that the Chili Man is super cool.  He's a no-BS kind of guy who is very friendly and chatted it up with me and my colleague while he put his love into our food.  I like to support people like him who run small business - keep it up, Chili Man!

Forget your diet - these dogs are the real deal."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was excellent! I absolutely loved the chili dogs and Vic was awesome. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and I was not disappointed. I had the vinegar bomb and mar-matt-Lon and both were delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"These are the best hotdogs I have had. Always a fresh twist on things, had the Bhan you Bhan Mi today it was awesome. Yes there is a line, because it is worth waiting for. But the wait is always entertaining."}
{"text":"All I can do is backup everything others have said. The best Hot dog in the City, rivaling NYC, this coming from a New Yorker. I am upset his hours make it so difficult to get to his dogs, but my arteries are probably better for it.

{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte 11 years now and yesterday was the first time I stopped by to see Vic. Friends have been raving about Chili Man for years so I am not sure what took me so long. I had a life changer and the frito pie dog, both were delicious. I have to make up for lost time so I am headed back today..."}
{"text":"This guy is a riot. He swoops into Uptown only a few days per week, but his little cart is jammed the whole time. Most of his products are homemade, home marinated, or home smoked, and definitely worth the effort. He has the awards to prove it. Ask him about any of the meats and he'll tell you the painstaking process that he went through to prepare it. But don't ask if you don't have time - each answer comes with a heaping side of Charlotte lore and Southern storytelling."}
{"text":"Absolutely splendid! I almost regret getting the perfectly cooked regular bratwurst, not because there was anything wrong with it, but because it was outshined by the incredible NACO DOG! Taco + Chili DOG? Yes please. The flavors blend into easily the best hot dog I've ever had."}
{"text":"A buddy introduced me to Vic in the summer of 2014 and I enjoyed it several times that year.  I was later saddened to learn Vic takes off the winter, and therefore was one of the first customers on opening day, March 17 2015.  I'm proud to say I devoured 4 chili dogs that day!  For any newbie attempting 4, I might recommend a sort of \"step up\" as follows:  1 regular chili dog to truly enjoy the homemade chili, 1 naco dog to enjoy the cheesy goodness, 1 heroine dog to enjoy one of many homemade barbeque sauces (my favorite is \"drunken pineapple\"), and 1 \"life changer\".  If I had to recommend just one?  Sorry, I can't eat just one.  But if I had to recommend two, it would probably be the naco and the heroine dogs.  Vic is also a cool dude.  And apologies to fellow yelper David S. who always seems to get stuck behind me and my large orders."}
{"text":"This guy is amazing. Best hot dogs ever. It's a whole experience to go chat and get a hot-dog.
Must try in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when you get lunch from Vic. Whether the stories or the food, it's all good. Be prepared to wait though because demand is high and always a line waiting from open to close."}
{"text":"Vic still continues to amaze me with his innovations!  I absolutely love that he makes all of his sauces himself. This is about as gourmet of a hot dog as you can get while still be totally laid back and casual. 

I don't work Uptown anymore, so unfortunately for me that means less trips to see Vic. When he posted his specials today, I knew that I had to head uptown for lunch.  Special #1: Mac 'n cheese, chili & crumbled bacon. Special #2: peanut butter & his homemade bacon jam.

That homemade bacon jam is truly out of this world --- Vic, pleasssssse start to use this on a more regular basis. It would be a great accompaniment to many of your existing dogs.

Keep innovating the hot-dog world and putting that Vic man 'soul' into each of your ideas!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Chili Man's dogs and tell you what? I tried the Naco-Dog and it`s THE most delicious hot-dog I have ever tried in my life and I`m not exaggerating. Plus to the great hot-dogs, Vic, the Chili Man is very friendly!

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are my jam, I can eat hot dogs anytime of the day, when I'm traveling, I will buy a hot dog and take a couple of bites even if I have just eaten, just for the love of hot dogs.  When I read about The Chili Man, I couldn't believe I didn't know about him! 
I once was lost but now I'm found.

Weekdays (except Monday) you can find The Chili Man's food cart parked in front of BofA and Chima on Tryon.  He is serving up delicious hot dogs with homemade chili, slaw, mustard and spicy ketchup.  

I would recommend going with someone so you can order three or four and cut them in half, so you can try different styles!!

Food cart, canned soft drinks, chips."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Both my dog and my son's were delicious. 

This dude's hotdogs are incredibly amazing! Kudos to the home-made condiments."}
{"text":"Not your average dog! Handmade sauces like pumpkin curry BBQ and a spicy one that uses the reaper pepper. And he has veg dogs and veg chili to boot. Super cool friendly guy that clearly loves what he does (and does it well). Check him out when you see his cart in town."}
{"text":"We just moved out of Charlotte and had a small list of places we absolutely had to visit before we left, Chili Man was one of them! His hot dogs are amazing and waiting in line for them is totally worth it (there's a reason there's always a line). Best hot dogs in town! If you're adventurous, let him recommend one for you. I recommend the Naco dog, which has grilled cheese (literally, cheese put directly on the grill until crisp and placed lovingly into the hot dog bun). You can't go wrong here, I promise. GO!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is new that I can add that hasn't already been said. Vic's street-side hot dog show is one to see (and taste) to believe. While walking down Tryon I saw the line already forming at 11 and knew exactly what was going on. Even though you may have to wait a bit, Vic provides an experience that is worth the wait. On this particular day he was spinning stories about winning big at high stakes bingo on a recent Disney cruise he took with his family (not a huge surprise considering his mickey mouse T-shirt that matched his tattoos), but talking with others around me this is the kind of light hearted funny banter you can expect from Vic. Then there are the hot dogs. His names are none other than creative, and I ended up ordering three hot dogs since I'm never in uptown at this time. The Frito Dog I ordered was definitely my favorite followed closely by his hot dog of the day with bacon and mac-n-cheese. The fact he grills his dogs and buns and has some amazing home sauces creates a unique flavor. In the midst of the Charlotte gourmet hot dog movement, Vic is certainly worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Vic the Chili Man and his cart for many years. His 'dogs are by far the best anywhere and his home made chili and sauces are amazing! His ability to combine so many amazing flavors and textures on top of a tasty grilled hot dog and toasted bun is what makes his food so incredibly delicious. I have tried other hot dog stands in and around town, but none of them even compares to the quality and taste of the Chili Man. 

Vic is extremely outgoing and friendly - kind of like lunch and a show - he is quick witted and quite entertaining! Even though the line can be pretty long during peak times, it has always been well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We hired Vic to cater hotdogs at our law firm's porch party.  I've eaten a many hotdogs in my lifetime, and Vic's were far and away the best I've ever had.  I ponder whether you should even call them hotdogs since each one is so unique.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Vic to cater an event.  He'll be at every one of our firm porch parties moving forward.  I forgot to mention that Vic, separate form his food, is a walking entertainer. I could BS with him all day and our guests loved him."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure what was on my hot dog.  And after eating it, I'm okay with that.  Vic knows his stuff."}
{"text":"I have been going to chili man for years and I always enjoys his customer service and food. Keep it up o love the food."}
{"text":"Vic is a hot dog master! He did an event at my apartment community at a great price and brought all his homemade hot sauces and chili, which were amazing! (I hear he does some mean catering too!) I wish I were lucky enough to be able to frequent his cart for lunch: his specials and regular menu are both incredible!"}
{"text":"Yeah, 58 5-Star ratings (as of 3.31.16) isn't a fantasy! Vic the Chili Man's food is LEGIT! He's a great guy serving up great food. I shouldn't have been surprised there was a line only :30 min after opening. I'm not one for lines... The day before I paid for Express Lane passes at Carowinds! But, I can honestly say, the wait is worth it. Just be patient and it goes pretty steadily. It's actually quite impressive for a one man show. 

Order: The Life Changer, Q-Dog and Fritto Pie Dog. Even if you'd never dream of eating 3 hotdogs, order them all and have a few bites of each. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp's highest rated hot dog, and rightfully so. He has a number of staples (vinegar bomb, nacho dog, etc...) that constantly keep the line long, but I equally enjoy his specialty dogs that change on a weekly basis. They are super creative, fun, and always delicious. Some of my past favorites have included the \"Banh Mi dog\" and a \"bacon jam dog.\""}
{"text":"Hands down best hot dogs in Charlotte. Can't go wrong with any of Vic's creations. Keep a look out for the weekly special."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try The Chili Man's Choice because the mustard on it is \"The Carolina Reaper Madness\". To me that sounded like something out of an episode of fear factor, but between Vic's charm and a friend of mine who is a regular, I folded. I'm a sucker for mustard. Oh man! This mustard has just enough of the pepper to put a spring in your step. The magical chili mingled with that and the perfectly cooked hotdog and the toasted bun had me hooked and wanting to get back in line for a second one, only I had a Mac & Cheese Chili dog waiting for me.

I have a weakness for mustard but nothing compares to my compulsion for ordering Mac and Cheese. OH MAN! I was not disappointed.
This Chili guy must be some kind of wizard. He ruined all other dogs for me with just those two. I can't wait until he's back in the spring for me to try more."}
{"text":"Yes, Vic's stand really is as good as all the reviews rave about.

First time here, I ordered the life changer... I don't know what kind of wizardry Vic does, but I didn't know hot dogs could taste so good. 

For anyone working in uptown, do yourself and go here for lunch. I've had too many disappointing meals costing me at least $13 each time. You'll spend half that here, treat your taste buds, and you're guaranteed to get some interesting convos with Vic!"}
{"text":"These are the best hot dogs you will find anywhere in the Charlotte area!!!! The menu is awesome and chili man kills it! Great prices and very convenient!!"}
{"text":"You would think that Vic would just rest on his laurels and accept that he's found the perfect combinations of dogs. Don't change things up, just keep it normal, right?

To heck with that. I got news for you: Chili Man wasn't just hibernating over the Winter. When Vic wasn't working on his SHRED fundraiser, helping families with extraordinary medical needs, he was in the trenches of the kitchen coming up with borderline-insane menu concoctions.

Just how many slam dunk combinations can you put on a Hot Dog? Take my advice, don't get him started!

The Mac & Cheese & Chili & Bacon dog is a fine example. It's a huge fan favorite and only comes up as a special a few weeks in the season. How could you possibly add anything to this without it getting lost in the other flavors? How about looking at texture first, then backing that up with supreme taste: Parmesan and Garlic flavored Panko bread Crumbs to top it off. Do I have your attention now?

Last week he was going Canadian with this awesome Beer Cheese and Potato Stix on top. The week before that was a \"No Snail Escargot Dog\" that had button mushrooms to die for. I've got a feeling that we haven't seen the end of these international flashes of brilliance.

The flowers are blooming, the last frost of the winter is (hopefully) behind us, and that crazy, 'almost family friendly' guy on Tryon St is still at it. If you had a hot dog for lunch and it wasn't from Chili Man's cart, then I'm sorry, it was a boring dog compared to this.

Keep on keepin' on."}
{"text":"First time going today and I ended up getting two. His chilli is AMAZING! Even better than the hotdogs I got in New York last summer! 
You must try!!"}
{"text":"Vic's hot dogs are damn good. I've never had hotdog chili this good from a cart or anywhere else. (It has beans, like his sign.) It's not that canned pre-made crap you find at other run of the mill hotdog carts or dairy queens. This is why he is indeed the Chili Man. 

I've been all up and down the East coast. I've been to the Varsity in Atlanta, GA, and up to the Happy Dog in Cleveland, OH, and many other hotdog places on this side of the states and I have to say Vic the Chili Man has them all beat.

The Chili Man's Choice has the perfect amount of heat. (With its cheese, reaper mustard, and the chili comboing beautifully on a perfectly cooked hotdog.) If it's your first time, and you like a little spice without stifling the flavor, get this dog."}
{"text":"On the top of my daily Yelp email was \"Hot Diggity Dog\".  As A hot dog lover I had to take a peak.

Walked down to corner of Trade and Fourth (right in front of Chima) and was surprised at the long line however good things come to those who wait.

Coolest thing is all toppings are included in the very reasonable price so whatever you want its good.  Great guy to chat with and just an overall great spot.  Thanks for the email Yelp!

Tip - Get the melted cheese (it comes on some of the specialty dogs and he will be glad to put it on anything if you ask)."}
{"text":"Vic aka \"chili man\" works across from our food cart on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I must say does have some of the best dogs I have had.  Super nice guy, chili and BBQ sauce maker extrordinaire.....like with awards and stuff.  If you are uptown on those days come over to 4th and Tryon and give it a try for a top quality dog and good conversation."}
{"text":"If you're in Charlotte Vic is a must! Hot dogs are so good! Might be a wait but it'll be well worth it and Vic's stories are always funny! I recommend the Frito Pie Dog!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with Chili mans hotdogs.... I wait all winter for Vic to come back downtown and serve his AMAZING hotdogs !!! Everything on his menu has been good every bite. My favorite hot dog is the frito pie dog and then the Lifechanger. The way Vic comes up with all the tops is amazing and are great combinations. The line is always long but it is always worth the wait. Vic makes the wait enjoyable with all of his funny stories or random visitors that come by that are entertainment as well. Chili Mans is really a Charlotte gem and a must try !!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Vic is awesome and his dogs rock!   I love the homemade condiments and attention to detail. Definitely a must visit when in CLT!"}
{"text":"Wow, last Friday I had one of the best hot dogs ever. Its rare I venture beyond some simple ingredients on a hot dog but this time my wife and I had one with Mac and cheese and bacon. Wow, what a great dog. The owner truly loves what he does and he talks with everyone. Great experience and we are looking forward to more samplings in the future.

thanks
Mark G."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Vic's hot dogs for a long time.  It's a bit of a drive so I never was able to find time to head down there. Finally went today and it def lived up to the hype. It's an experience for sure. Vic is a character and tells stories while you wait in line.  Really funny guy and makes a great dog. I got the heroin and the special which was a Mac and cheese, chili  and bacon dog. The chili is amazing def worth a trip if you ever want to check it out"}
{"text":"In case you were wondering, my lunch consisted of the best damn veggie hotdog, with a toasted bun, a layer of grilled ghost pepper cheese, spicy mustard and veggie chili.  
To say I'm full and happy is an understatement.

Vic has awesome food, great prices and some funny conversations to keep you entertained while you wait for heaven on a bun topped with your choice of flavored. 
My lunch was so great yesterday with the vinegar bomb that I had to go back for another today.  He's friendly and remembers everything!  You gotta have a dog here!"}
{"text":"Every city has hot dog carts, but I have never visited one like this.

These are truly a gourmet experience at standard hot dog cart prices. I have never had a better hot dog at home, or another venue.

Vic, the proprietor and chef, is always fun, as he serves up his witty banter and dogs. The cooking is always on point. 

There are homemade sauces, and he frequently offers a special recipe dog so that you can try something different.

The Life Changer is my go to order.

I advise getting there early, because the line can get to be a bit absurd. It is very convenient, that he also takes Square payments."}
{"text":"Heard about the Chili man through online food reviews. I decided I would try to find the man, the myth, the legend in Uptown. I got my car and began my quest to find they one called Vic. As soon as I saw the strange, ponytailed man, I parked my car and headed for the massive line. The line felt like forever, but once I got to the front, ordered the Life Changer, and took a bite, I knew it was all worth it. Pure ecstasy filled my mouth. The name of the dog, much to my surprise, is such a huge understatement. The most delicious hot dog I think I will ever have. I Definitely recommend the experience to anyone with taste buds. Vic, if you're reading this, you have made a new fan."}
{"text":"This guy Vic is hilarious! Just an added bonus to his very innovative menu of hotdogs and brats.  Maybe not the best place for the faint of heart as the Chili man speaks freely (very freely) and doesn't really give a s***.  I got he the Chili Man's choice and vinegar bomb, chips and a drink all for under $8 and was very pleased with my meal.  Only down side I can think of here is that his lines get really really long so try to get there before noon on nice days.  Other than that its just something you gotta try if you're in Uptown.  Nothing more to say but I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing food cart on the corner of 4th and Tryon -- today it was right near Chima -- I got there before 11 and there's already a line. A good sign of an amazing food cart is the crowd it attracts. This is a place where you'll see all the people of Uptown; businesspeople that work in the local companies but also construction workers, parking enforcement, and even tourists on Segways will stop by and talk to Vic if not order a dog from him. There was a guy today that had a box just so that he could carry hot dogs back to his office.

Vic is a friendly guy with a very good sense of humor and will talk with you as you're waiting in line for your hot dogs. These aren't just plain jane hot dogs (although if you want, you can get that) but amazing gourmet quality hotdogs at a plain jane price. I mean, where else can you get 3 loaded hotdogs for $9.75 for lunch in Uptown? Today's special was a peanut butter and homemade bacon jam hot dog and I don't think I'll get anything like that ever again anywhere else. Who would've thought that those two things go together? I mean, this is probably sacrilege to say but I thought that bacon jam was better than the one I had at the Ashbury. Plus that chili was amazing on the other dogs that I had (backslide and the life changer) and I wouldn't mind having just a cup or a bowl of that chili on its own. I will definitely be back later!"}
{"text":"The chili man is an awesome guy with an exceptional talent for making hot dogs. Simple but amazing. Talk to him about skating or his competitions with local chefs. He always has a great story and may even let you try his Cincinnati chili that he hasn't come out with yet! Some of the best hot dogs I've ever had!"}
{"text":"So, I finally found Vic the Chili Man. And I love him. 

I got the Nacho Dog - best. idea. ever.I can't even describe how excited I was when he put the cheese right on the grill top. OMG. delicious. The dogs are cheap, compared to the experience. He takes credit cards, with no minimum. And the line is worth the wait. 

Vic is so friendly and welcoming, that you feel like you've known him forever. He talks you through the line, so don't despair, get in on the conversation. Its obvious that he loves what he does, and loves the people that he meets. He's one of those people that you never have to think twice about saying hello to, you say hello and then chat for 20 mins about New York or Amsterdam. Seriously, we chatted about both yesterday. He's the guy that you go to get a dog, and bring your family and friends to meet Vic. 

After my experience here, I'm not surprised at all that he has such good reviews, or such a long line. You can't blame people!! Vic is fantastic."}
{"text":"Best dog around and it comes with free entertainment! Vic makes the time pass if you get stuck in a line, but I try to go early. Love the homemade condiments and tend to like my dog kind of basic: mustard, onion & relish, but then I break down and ask for the homemade chili. I can't resist. Try it and you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"Best. Hot dogs. Ever. And really, the only street food I eat...Vic is a great guy that helps Charlotte get great food! I love the Life Changer :-)"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to run into the Chili Man truck during my bachelorette party this past weekend. I was in town all the way from Texas so naturally I had to get the frito pie hot dog and it was AMAZING. I'm so sad I can't have 12 more!! The food was great and Vic was super friendly, do yourself a favor and find the chili man, you won't regret it!

Thanks again Vic
-The Bride :) (2 of 6)"}
{"text":"I saw that Vic got a four star review, so I have to balance it out with a five star review because his hot dogs really are the best. I always try to go for a special when I can, and I remember the one time he made an Italian style pepperoni dog, it truly was the best hot dog I've ever had. I like Vic's jokes because he's able to be funny without ever being offensive. Vic for president!!!"}
{"text":"Had my first visit and Vic is the best. The line was 10 deep at 11:15am and he charmed the crown as we patiently waited for the best chili dog I have ever had. The Boogie Down Dog was so good I wasn't sure that Southern all the way would even come close. Both were outstanding. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Chiliman Vic, takes Hotdogs to a whole new level. I had one if his gourmet Chili dogs and was completely blown away. He definitely serves the best Hotdogs in Charlotte, and I will recommend him to all of my friends. Oh, by the way, he's funny too. Great entertainment while he does your food. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"When I first started working Uptown I wanted to get a \"street hotdog\" since I had always associated the downtown life with a great frank (don't ask me why, maybe too many movies). On my third day on the job I went to find a hotdog stand and was successful. However, it was just a plain jane hot dog with a little ketchup and mustard. Good but not really anything to look forward to again.

Fast forward a few weeks. I am walking the streets of Tryon looking for something to inspire my palette because I'm in one of those rare moods where I just can't decide what I'm hankering for.

I came across the Chili Man stand on Tryon between 4th and Trade and saw a few people ordering and being chatted up by the owner. Loving verbal engagement I wandered over and stood in line meanwhile listening to a random story being recounted by the Chili Man himself.
There are essentially two main options on the menu: Hotdogs and Brats.
Fortunately I happen to like both and ordered one of each.

Then I got to pick my toppings for my meal. For my brat I just got brown mustard and Sauerkraut (major kudos for even offering a brat with kraut, which is surprisingly rare). I took my dog based on his recommendation which included spicy mustard, spicy ketchup, chili and cheese.

I will say both were great but the chili just put things over the edge. It did not seem like a generic canned chili and I have been told (though not confirmed) that he makes it himself. It would not surprise me. It does not matter if you don't have cash because he is up on the digital age and can accept credit cards.

So the food is fantastic but one thing that makes you want to come back and what puts this place at the top of my Uptown lunch list (besides the chili) is Vic \"the Chili Man\" himself. I do not think this man has ever met a stranger. He always has a great story or conversation topic that has nothing to do with the weather, sports or politics. It is refreshing to say the least. If you are ever in a downcast mood, this man can lift your spirits with a good conversation or story. He is not intentional about it, it is just who he is.

Come for the dogs, hang around the cart for the conversation. Be prepared to repeat."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a hotdog eater but HOLY SMOKES this dude can fix the ultimately delicious hotdog. There may be a little bit of a wait but trust me it's totally worth it. Also the attitude, and hospitality of The Chili Man is like no other. If your in uptown definitely give Vic a try!"}
{"text":"You gotta love Chili Man (Vic) and you gotta love the dogs!  This is a Charlotte staple and once you've waited in the line and heard Vic's stories and then had the chance to devour several of the dogs (you can't order just one) then you'll know why!
Love it, keep up the great work... and looking forward to trying the Pink Panther dog (in the ever changing name of the pink sauce series). ;)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dog I've ever had. Today was my first time eating there. I got the Vinegar Bomb and the Chili Mans Choice. Got lunch and show! Lol. The Chili Man was a one man show and if you were going to wait in his line he was definitely going to make sure you knew he appreciated your business. Loved this place, going back tomorrow, & a short wait in line in the sun was more than worth it!

You should absolutely try it and don't forget to tip the cook (aka the show)!"}
{"text":"I would have to admit that I have never been a fan of any hot dogs until I tried Chili Man's hot dog. So many options to choose from: spicy, specials, and plain ole type of hot dogs. I always got for the Chili Man's choice!"}
{"text":"Vic the chili man is worth every one of his five stars!if I could give him five more I would."}
{"text":"Best hot dog vendor ever!!!!!!! Super personable and fantastic customer service. Has all kinds of hot dogs and makes up his own combinations. Very funny and pleasant to be around!"}
{"text":"One word: yum! We loved Vic! I got the Life Changer (rightfully named) and my boyfriend got the nacho dog and the stop light! Delicious and reasonably priced! Liked buying from a guy like Vic!"}
{"text":"Hands down best hot dogs in town, heck I'd say that they are the best in the country, Vic is friendly and makes sure that every hot dog is perfect and he takes pride in serving the best hot dogs that money can buy. If you are ever in Uptown Charlotte around lunch time during his serving season stopping at the Chili Man hot dog stand is a must!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for Chili Man, I knew I had to make it a stop while in Charlotte for the weekend. I ordered two dogs, the Frito Pie and the Life Changer. The man who runs this stand is incredibly friendly and seems to want to create an experience for his guests and not just push them through as I've experienced at other stands. If you are in line at a hot dog stand for 15+ minutes and people are not getting out of line there is a reason for that. 

He quickly worked on my order as we chatted about Yelp and local restaurants. Food was bagged up I grabbed my soda and found a nearby bench.

As I opened my mouthwatering deliciousness that sat before me, I couldn't wait to try it. I started with the Frito Pie. Simply amazing!! Followed by The Life Changer, and I do think I saved the best for last. The life changer is a perfect combo on flavors that just work perfectly together. 

If I have time on this trip I'll definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"The chili man was great! He catered a private party and all of the chili dogs were a huge hit! He's a great guy and the food is AMAZING.  Try it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best dog in the world! Vic is amazing and entertaining as well. If you havent tried one of his special dogs like last weeks wing dog you are missing out."}
{"text":"Vic transforms hot dogs into mouth-watering flavorful goodness. 
\"You will never order another dog from anyone else again after the Chili Man.\" 

I've been going to the Chili Man for a couple of years now. I'll stop by a few times a week. Make sure to select one of Vic's specialty sauces (homemade). I like to have a combination of sauces. Mixing some of the Spicy, BBQ, and sweet sauces, you create this explosion of flavor. 

The perfect combination, order: Heroin Dog (it's on the menu!) a few of us awhile back founded the creation of that dog; its flavor became popular. You want to have Vic's homemade chili, fried cheese, Naco Sauce, a BBQ and a Sweet/mango sauce, topped with chopped onions and extra shredded cheese. I can not emphasize enough that a simple hot dog just isn't going to cut it anymore. Vic sets a new standard! 

If you like Hot Dogs, the Chili Man is the way to go! Nothing else compares."}
{"text":"You know that quote \"Children are the orgasm of life\"? 

WELL IT'S WRONG.

Vic's hotdogs are THE orgasm of life. They take your tastebuds and your tummy to the most fulfilling places. There's no other way to describe it. Your tastebuds will climax. The wait in line is the foreplay and the contact with your salivating tongue the climax. 

And you'll want to do it again and again. 
TRUST ME--You won't mind the cleanup afterwards ;.p."}
{"text":"Chili man is a must try and deserves every bit of its #1 ranking on Yelp. Not only do you get amazing hotdogs with made from scratch chili and sauces but Vic also provides entertainment with all of his stories. You'll never be bored waiting in line for a hotdog with him behind the grill. Initially I went down the build your own route which was fine but Vic's recommended hot dogs are the way to go. The Life Changer is a definite life changer and the Frito Pie is another great one. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook to find out where he will be."}
{"text":"I hate I missed the worlds best dogs! My son played in Gus Macker 3 on 3 and said he had to have a dog or 2 after every game. The chili .... no words can tell you how good. You got a new follower."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying the Chili Man with some fun friends the other day.  There was a line, but well worth the wait since Vic definitely entertains you while waiting.  There is also the problem of deciding what you want since the menu is so delicious and you can't really go wrong with any choice - even build your own.

I had the Naco and the Heroin.... both of them were gone in 60 seconds.  Since Vic is a one man show, you can see how much love and personality he puts into all his hot dogs... which is unique when you think of a \"hot dog cart\" on the street.  Definitely a great staple to add to your Uptown Charlotte experience.  

Even after my dogs were secured in my belly, I was watching Vic interact with the customers and everyone definitely walks away with a smile and one hell of a chili dog.  There is a lot to be said in putting pride into your work and it definitely pays of for the Chili Man.  I've never seen a hot dog vendor chop a fresh onion (most are pre-prepared or soaking in liquid for who knows how long), but that's just one of the man details that this man puts into his creations."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I made the trek from South Charlotte.  Wow, was it worth it, worth the wait, Holy Cow!  We couldn't decide what to get, so we both got two.  The life changer is just that.  I lived in Chicago as a teenager, and USED to think a Chicago dog was the best there is...no longer.  Chili man's life changer is the best hot dog I've ever had.  Can't wait to go again.  I think he's right, my husband may have a problem with this, but I may be waking up in the night saying, \"Chili man, that's a life changer\""}
{"text":"Just when you think you've already had the best dogs in charlotte you run into chiliman.  What I think I like most - and find most unique - is that he puts fried cheese on a lot of his dogs. He will throw a pile of shredded cheese on the grill and let it cook until crispy. He will then lay that down on the bun and proceed to layer on the other toppings. The added texture works really well - plus it helps keep the bun from getting soggy. 

As others have said, Vic is a riot. I asked for the \"Life Changer\" dog and he replied with \"that it will my friend\". I then asked if he had any other dogs he recommended. After a long pause he tipped me off to a \"hidden\" dog that's not on his menu. Think \"Life Changer\" with a Cajun twist. Both dogs were really really good!  

He also serves up a really tasty chicken taco as well if he's offering it on the menu. Another must try if you ever find yourself at chiliman's food cart. 

The homemade sauces are over the top good. My favorite was the blueberry but they were all really good."}
{"text":"We went to Chili Man and had pretty high expectations.... and WOW - it surpassed those expectations. It was hands down the best hot dog spot I've ever been to. I was with 4 other people and we all had 3 rounds of deliciousness. We started out with the Life Changer (which I ended up getting twice...) and then he made us a buffalo / bleu cheese something or other... just wow. The food was crazy good, but Vic - Captain Awesome as we call him - is an all around awesome dude. 

I would recommend him over and over again.. and I'M LEAVING THE 50TH 5 STAR REVIEW.  :)"}
{"text":"Vic is a riot!  Go see him for some great food and (likely hilarious) conversation.  The guy is dedicated and makes his own condiments for goodness sake!  A must-try lunch in Uptown."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dog I've ever had! It was so good I even went back and got a second one! I flew to Charlotte from Arizona for a bachelorette weekend, and these hot dogs were definitely part of the memorable experience.

He had so many amazing choices including creating your own with a variety of toppings and sauces. Vic was incredibly personable and friendly!"}
{"text":"Come for the great dogs, stay for the conversation. Sidewalk socialite and local philanthropist, Vic will definitely put a smile on your face :)."}
{"text":"This is my 200th review! I have been scouting the Chili Man out since I kept seeing such amazing reviews on Yelp! I agree with Nikki W, it's strange that a Yelp Elite is bestowing 5 stars on a hot dog vendor. Well you better believe it! 

First off, he is a super nice and friendly guy! He knows his regulars and jokes with them. He engages the new customers. Word has it, that Cam Newton eats there at least once a week. I thought Cam was a pescatarian but if anything is going to make him turn to the dark side of beef, it would be the Chili Man's hot dogs. 

Every week, he has specials and they are interesting takes on a ballpark snack. His regular menu is amazing itself. Next time I go, I am trying the Vinegar dog which is dill pickles, saurkraut, jalepenos, and mustard for toppings. The chili dog is also amazing and I could eat about ten of them. If you are reading this, try it out! Its worth your wile!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs and conversation in Charlotte! Veggie dog and chili are both really good & the vinegar style (I know sounds iffy) is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the \"chili man\" is the most appropriate name for Vic because ALL of his hot dogs are good, and not just the ones with chili. He's an entertaining guy as others have said, genuinely cares about his customers, and he always provides awesome dogs with great service. 
My favorite part is the dogs come exactly as you like. While there is a list of the famous \"named\" dogs, you can change or add unlimited toppings to them for no extra charge, and he'll make things exactly as you like. Want a TON of spicy mustard? No problem. Just a little BBQ sauce? Same deal. He even asked me if I wanted the BBQ sauce on my \"Q Dog\" to be spicy, sweet, or fruity and how much. 
The hot dogs and buns are solid quality, but what sets the Chili Man apart are his toppings. The chili is really beefy, flavorful, fresh, and clearly not from a can. The spicy mustard is awesome, the slaw is vinegary but just slightly sweet, the taco sauce is good..I could go on and on about every topping, but the point is they're great. If your dog has \"fried cheese\" he even puts a little cheddar cheese directly on the griddle to crisp up before adding it to the dog which is perfect. 
Go to the Chili Man, order a few hot dogs depending on how hungry you are (I'm partial to the life changer with extra mustard if you like fairly spicy things), pay the cheap price, thank Vic, and enjoy your killer lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality & experience. Homemade ketchup, homemade mustards, homemade chili, etc. Not your typical streetside food cart."}
{"text":"Well, this is my 300th review and I can't think of anyone more deserving of it than the Chili Man. Sidenote: I'm writing this review while eating a salad. This is the definition of torture.

I know what you're thinking, 300 reviews and she's giving 5 stars to a hot dog street vendor?! Vic is a lot more than that. He takes great pride in making quality toppings and creative menu options. On top of great food, he is a one man show. If there's a line, it is completely worth the wait. From his stories and anecdotes, to the menu descriptions and Chili Man facts, you'll have a giant smile on your face the entire time. You can't possibly have a bad day when you see Vic.

On to the food, he has different specials during the week. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter to see what he's got cooking. #SeeWhatIDidThere. Vic has told me for weeks that I need to get the Life Changer. I don't want to say a hot dog changed my life, but hot damn I do believe it did. It definitely deserves that name. Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard. It took a lot of restraint to only eat two hot dogs.

Things to know: don't see something on the named menu you like? Don't worry, you can build your own. Dogs come with unlimited toppings. Say what?! He does take a credit card. Don't work uptown and need a place to park? I like to park a couple blocks away on Poplar between 3rd and 4th streets. There are meters here and it's way cheaper than the parking decks. Don't have change? Use the park mobile app. Takes all of maybe ten seconds to park and pay. And trust me, you'll be thankful for that little walk back to your car after the dogs.

Review #300 is in the books. Here's to the next 300!"}
{"text":"This guy is amazing and the food never disappoints! Come early though, cuz everyone else knows it too and the line can get pretty long! Definitely leaves the taste buds dancing!"}
{"text":"Thus guy is a famous icon now.  So he's not here everyday, sometimes he goes out hired for an event, sometimes just weather.  

I had his best 3 selling dogs.  They are better than avg, but by all means they are not blown u away as what everyone saying.

Overall im happy this cart is around.  Quality food and decent price.  Hope their hrs is bit more consistent."}
{"text":"I've been stopping by Chili Man's stand for almost five years and I'm never disappointed. Great dogs, great toppings (A+ spicy mustard), reasonable prices, and entertaining conversation. Vegetarians may have to put up with a few wisecracks but the veggie dogs are delicious too. 

If you need an event catered I highly recommend as well. Chicken salad is phenomenal. Seriously."}
{"text":"My biggest regret is waiting to try his hot dogs right before my employer transferred me out of uptown. Now whenever I have a meeting I go out of my way to stop by.  The Frito Lays is my favorite off the original menu but the blue cheese hot dog he has on special is the best I've had yet. He's got a great personality and is funny to talk to which helps make waiting in line worth it. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best hotdog I've ever had! Definitely worth the wait. So much great flavor and unique dogs!! Highly recommended! 

Just hope he opens more often and not just in uptown! SouthEnd is a great spot as well"}
{"text":"I have tried most of the hot dog vendors in the uptown area and \"The Chili Man\"  is by far the best!  Also, you always get very good conversation while you wait!  What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"I had my first ever hotdog here (Yep..new to the US..they dont have decent hotdogs back in India) and omg it was so delicious..I tried the Life Changer and Turkey Bacon Ranch Hotdog and both were equally good.Especially loved the Chili, you can tell all the ingredients were fresh.Vic is funny,so you dont get bored even if there was a queue. :)  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"It is very telling that as of the time I am typing this review, every single review I see is a 5-star review.  This is the best hotdog in Charlotte, along with a side of personality and flare.  Vic used to come to the law school for lunches and now I seek his cart out when I need my hotdog fix.  Definitely give his cart a shot.  If there's a wait, make sure you stick around because it is worth it."}
{"text":"If you're searching for a great hot dog this is the place. Chili Man, an Uptown vendor, offers a variety of dogs--basic chili dogs to special, one of a kind. Lots of regular customers and Vic is entertaining to say the least. Get there early--they run out of dogs quickly. Open M-F from around 11a to 230 ish. You have to visit Chili Man. Located on N. Tryon near Chima's."}
{"text":"These are the best hot dogs I've ever tasted. I try to go every Wednesday. Where else can you go to get some good street meat and be properly insulted by the cook? Truly the best hot dogs in America."}
{"text":"Today is a sad day for me. This is the last time I will be getting a Chili Man hotdog.

No Vic is not going away, but I am moving down to Atlanta so the 3 1/2 hour ride it too much of a stretch to get his wonderful lunch time treats.

Vic has got the Chili dog down to an art form. 
Are you having a bad day at work? Go find Vic and get a hotdog. I have enjoyed the 10 minute break of food heaven for the time I've been in Charlotte.

It all started when the work crew came back from his cart carry his dogs. And ohhh man did they smell good.  After a little bit of hunting around on Tryon I found him, \"and the well deserved line\".

If you don't get there when he opens up, there will be a line. Vic does his best to tweet/Facebook out when he will be around, but it's best if you go for a walk and look for his huge green patio umbrella.

And yes......

It's That Good"}
{"text":"Vic is the best! He always has crazy and delicious specials, but my standard go to is the Frito Pie- so good! The perfect Friday lunch for under $10. Can't beat it! The line can get long, but Vic always has entertaining stories and the dogs are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Vic's dogs where one of the biggest things I missed when I stopped working uptown. Need to make a trip sometime soon."}
{"text":"Can't get much better than this.  A great variety of toppings and homemade sauces and his special grilled cheese.  Sounds cliché, but the hardest part of going here is deciding what to get.  My top two are the frito pie dog and the traffic light but I add one of his special sauces (like siracha ginger).

Get there early, there's often a line.  If you search him on Facebook, he often has \"special\" dogs for just that day, too."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like a valued customer go here. If you want awesome hot dogs go here. If you want entertaining during your lunch time go here. Literally everyone that walked by was like \"hey Vic\" or \"what's up chili man!\" It was quite entertaining. 
I got the life changer and my husband got the backside destroyer (hopefully it doesn't live up to its name...for my sake). After we devoured our hot dogs in less than a minute we went back and got the special which was a Greek dog. Sooooo good! Go here!!!!!!!
Best hot dog in Charlotte and we basically have eaten all the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Best hot dog place in Charlotte! It's a great deal and he has many speciality combinations on the menu or you can pick whatever you want on your dogs. I go with chili, cheese, and jalapenos. He's not there every day so you have to look for him."}
{"text":"Very good hot dogs and a variety of homemade toppings - can't go wrong.  I love just the basics chili, cheese and spicy mustard."}
{"text":"By far the Best Hot Dog I have ever had in my life plus the lovely gentleman behind the counter was  super friendly. Going back before we leave town!!"}
{"text":"Omg Vic and his dogs are awesome sauce and then some! My boyfriend has been raving about the Chili Man and his stand for months now. I was finally able to have him come down during his lunch break for some of these amazing hot dogs. 

The Chili Man hot dog stand is parked right in front of Chima's steakhouse Tuesday-Friday from 11a-2p. There will be a line, but don't let it deter you. Not only are the dogs delicious but Vic is friendly and funny. Despite the fact that you'll be waddling away after chowin down and may need a food coma nap afterwards, the Chili Man experience is worth it. JUST DO IT, as I will tell you in the next paragraph, even vegans don't have an excuse. 

What really had me sold was Vic now has vegetarian friendly tofu dogs! Seriously most thoughtful hot dog vendor EVER! I walked over with my bf just expecting him to fulfill his craving, I wasn't going to get anything since the last uploaded menu on yelp only consisted of red meat hot dogs. But to my surprise I was able to have one too, I was so happy! AND the Chili Man even offers VEGAN Chili Wednesdays complete with vegan hot dogs and TVP chili. So rad. 

Ok I'll stop raving now.. Lol so my boyfriend had the life changer and I had a vegetarian friendly life changer with a tofu dog and minus the chili. We didn't talk to each other while eating, hell, I don't even think we took a breath. That's how good the Chili Man dogs are. All in all, the Chili Man is THE man and his dogs are righteous. Goes without saying he will be seeing me every week..which brings me to my next quest...I need to find a good gym. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The lunch, the personality, the stories! You can never go wrong when you get food and a show and Vic provides both of them. The food is good no matter which selection you go with and in the time it took him to make my wife's Life Changer I heard three stories that made me want to pull up a seat and hear some more."}
{"text":"I don't always eat hot dogs but when I do they are out of a street cart, and you get a side of humor thrown into the mix with Vic the Chili Man!  

This was my first trek and my only \"negative\" is that it took a little bit to get our food (and in his defense, it was his first day open for the season) but when something is good - others find out about it and it's typically worth the wait!  I wasn't disappointed!  Got two dogs and a bottle of water for $7.  I got the Heroin and the Life Changer.  Typically I can't comment on Heroin but I can tell you this hot dog is quite addicting, and that the Life Changer, was in fact life changing!  I was advised in line to not look like a rookie and go with the \"named dogs\", btw.

Look forward to getting back and enjoying this experience again!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. The guy is awesome so friendly and really loves his job, I love grabbing a dog or two from him. I am vegetarian and the veggie dogs are great lots of choices and really tasty, take an extra few minutes as cooked fresh, but that is no bad thing."}
{"text":"Vic serves up the best chili dogs in Charlotte - with plenty of stories to entertain you while you wait.  Look for the line of people on N. Tryon St. around lunch time spring to fall.  Vic toasts the buns, grills the cheese, and serves 100% beef Khans dogs with vegetarian options, too.  You'll laugh, enjoy a delicious chili dog, and get a souvenir on your shirt to remind you to come back again."}
{"text":"Let's just say that Chili Man IS The Man!  The guy takes the time to make his own ketchup and spicy mustard so that should tell you something right there.  The dogs he serves are seared to perfection on his carts flat top and my goodness, he's not called Chili Man for nothing.  This is some darn good chili he puts on the dogs.  

As others have noted, if he weren't Chili Man, he would be Chatty Man because the dude has never met a stranger and you are guaranteed some lively conversation as he works on your food.  An A+ street food vendor and his work is much appreciated."}
{"text":"Stopped by Chili Man for lunch earlier this week.  Luckily there wasn't that long of a line.  After reviewing the menu, I decided on a pimento cheese and chili dog and a southern dog.  There is good conversation between Vic and customers in line as the dogs are made.

In no time, the dogs were in my hand.  Two dogs and a water for ~$7 isn't bad at all.

The chili has beans and peppers so don't expect \"hot dog chili.\"  However, it has a good taste and a nice spice.The pimento cheese helped to cool it down.  Very good.  I had asked Vic to add the spicy mustard to the southern dog but there was some confusion because I think he added the spicy ketchup.  It blended with the chili and almost made a sloppy joe flavor.  Not bad but not exactly what I was expecting.  I really liked the slaw he uses too.

I'll definitely return to Chili Man next time I'm in the Uptown area for lunch."}
