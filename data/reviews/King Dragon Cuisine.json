{"text":"So slow.  Food never came.  We waited for 30 minutes and still no food.

Never again will I visit this place again"}
{"text":"Table booked few days before. Arrived 15 mins early, the waiter told us they gave our table to another person.  We notice on the table booking sheet they wrote 'haven't arrive' beside it.  So we question the remarks bedside our name.  The waiter told us it was mistake.  It was very disappointing.  
Food wise parents come here for dimsum.  To be honest, food are mediocre.  There are way more chinese restaurant have better standard."}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience. Overbooked restaurant and took an hour for the first course to be served. Even the servers admitted they couldn't handle the amount of customers.

Edited :  food poisoning alert. My parents threw up all night after eating here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service for dinner with a party of 12. Contacted Albert Chan, manager, three days earlier, took his advice for a special \"banquet\" meal. Everyone was happy I did, cost was reasonable. He took special care of my gluten intolerance and I was able to eat  four of the eleven courses. The dining room was full and we had to wait a little bit between courses. Wait staff was courteous and never rushed us. Contact Mr. Chan by email if you can't get hold of him by phone."}
{"text":"The decoration is fancy, much better than the pevious restaurant of the same address.   When passed by the fish tanks, there ae not too many seafood there.

The durian dessert smells strong once you stirred it.  Lucikly the waitress is fast enough to collect the glasses once they are done.   The pork dumpling with the scallop all over the place, not on top of the dumpling.   The presentation has to be better.  The congees are very good, comparable to the specialty restaurant.  The rest of the dim sum is average.

The toilet is clean.  With patterns engraved on the floor tiles, it may be very difficult to clean in the future.  

After we chat with the manager about the dim sum and ask him for a dinner menu, he forgot once he left us.   For a newly open restaurant, he should be more enthusiatic to promote the business.

If the chef is really from Lee Wah Heen,  the standard is disappointing."}
{"text":"I been sitting here since 7pm for my dinner and finally now at 9:34pm lobster came out and they want us to pay 80$ for four piece of small lobster meat (they tried convincing us that's how many pieces in a lobster.but we have experience and know it's a lie)...this is ridiculous for Chinese New Year eve dinner. They should be prepared for business and have some sort of system going on. They are running all over place, and EVERY TABLE is asking for their LOBSTER
Holy the stress! All servers were rude.
3 hrs for dinner end up sending it back. 
Disappointed all the way."}
{"text":"Friday night family dinner with 5 people. They had a special going on there it was order $60 of food, (from the black book menu only) you can add on 2 double lobsters for $10. 

Ended up ordering 4 dishes plus the lobsters. The oyster hot pot had 9 pieces of oysters for $18. We also ordered a tofu hot pot, crispy chicken, and beef with veggies - which wasn't listed in the black book menu, and when we asked for how much that would be, the server said around $10.

When the bill came, we noticed they charged us for an extra bowl of rice. Also the beef and veggies ended up costing the same as the oyster hot pot! Ridiculous. They also charged us more for the tofu hot pot. Seemed like they just randomly priced the dish, and we had to show them the price in the menu for them to fix the bill.

The food is good, but the service is really lacking. Definitely need some help on that end."}
{"text":"This place has decent food. Kind of hard to find as it is hidden on the second floor of commerce gate. But worth a trip. Had a 10 course there and each dish was nice and flavourful, only faults I could find were in the fish dish, where the fish was slightly overlooked and kind of bland, and the fried rice, which was mushy and too moist. 
The roasted chicken was impressive, the white meat still remained juicy which is very very rare for this dish. 
Service was ok but they did seem like they are trying to rush you through the courses."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and my last 2 visits have been very dissapointing. The service was terrible, when I would ask for something I would get ignored or the server would call someone else because they didn't want to do it (LAZINESS). A lot of my food was cold. Today dinner we had to wait 1 hour and 30 minutes before getting any of our food. And then we had to wait an additional 45 minutes for an $80 lobster that in my tables opinion was not worth the amount. The lobster was lacking in meat and was rather small, I've eatin a lot of lobster so I'm aware of the size and price of my lobsters. We returned the lobster after they dropped the price down to $60.
Doubt I will be dining here anymore."}
{"text":"We came here after waiting over an hour for a table at Dragon Boat. Maybe it's because we were starving-but the food was incredible. The sesame balls with custard in the middle were our favorite. All the rice rolls were fresh and hot. Pay cash and not credit for a significant discount."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Chinese banquet restaurants in toronto. The atmosphere is clean and the food is great. The 10 course menu is fairly proceed and fresh. The servers are very kind and show you great hospitality by getting you what you need and provides great explanations on what they're serving. 

The plaza on the other hand can be crammed as it is one of the popular ones in Richmond Hill but if you squeeze through then you can park in the underground. 

Watch out for the red clothes used in placement of napkins. Leave them on your lap too long and you may get a permanent red stain on your pants. I learned the hard way and stained my lap.

Overall a great place to eat and a great bank for your buck."}
{"text":"Service is very slow, the kitchen is oddly placed in between the front door and waiting area. The food trolls from the kitchen across a crowded waiting area and into the dining room. I had to replace my bowl and spoon since it was dirty to only receive another dirty spoon and bowl. Since the service was so slow I found it upon myself to dig in the cabinets to find a clean spoon and bowl. The food was sub par and the service was slow."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for dim sum.

They now have all day $2.90 dim sum which is a great deal.  Their har gow (shrimp dumpling) is the best I've had in a long time.  Also, if you purchase over $20, you can get a rice bowl (in a stone bowl) for $1.99 (i think it's originally $5.99).  They have a large selection of dim sum and the quality is usually pretty good.  They are upstairs at the Commerce Gate plaza and also have wifi.  You can also get a stamp card... after a certain number, you get a free dish or something.  I think it changes based on supply."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Canada Day with my parents early in the morning hoping for some Siu Mai (steamed minced pork dumpling wrap in wonton skin open face).  It is my favourite dim sum.  The food started arriving 20 minutes wait after we ordered the food.  That's a long long long wait considering Chinese dim sum restaurant standard.  The congee we ordered had a bug in it, and after we spoke with a waitress to exchange for a new one.  However, it seemed like she was doing us a huge favor to switch the congee.  Did they want us to report this to the local health unit before she will exchange it.  I was like \"lady, wtf..xoxo...\". (A whole bunch of chinese swear words came to my mind).  Of course, I didn't say that out loud since my dad love to seem polite and had \"face\".  

Anyhow, we waited another 25 minutes, and finally most of the dim sum arrived.  And they were okay quality, just average.  I was particularly not satisfied with not having \"siu mai\".  This is my favorite dim sim and the waitress told us either to wait or cancel the order.  What kind of customer servce is this and their dim sum is not even cheap, and I did not like how it doss not match the expectation the restaurant stated at the front door.  \"Star worthy restaurant\".  I think that maybe  a minus minus minus star.  lol.  Well, just to be nice, I still give this restaurant two star.  Unless, you really want dim sum and is out of option, I recommend you choose somewhere else.  Have a fun long weekend guys!"}
{"text":"I come here often for dimsum with my gf and her family.  It's a very nice restaurant and the decor is grand and well put together.  The place looks fancy from the dining area to the washrooms.  All I see walking around is gold trim and elaborate carvings on the walls and floors.

I mainly come for dimsum, but the dinner menu is clean and really well cooked.  The fish is usually very fresh and there are many choices on the menu to fit anyone's needs.  The dimsum menu is nice and the food tastes amazing.  After 1:30-2pm is also the cheap dimsum menu so you can save a bit if you eat later.  My favourite items are the staple rice cakes in banana leaf, siew mai and deep fried squid tentacles.  The tea is also nice and refreshing and the servers are prompt in refilling your tea pots!

Overall I really enjoy coming here and like the atmosphere and food.  They also have a nifty points card to allow you to trade for toys, appliances, rice bags or discounts off your next meal!"}
{"text":"Cheapie cheapie dim sum. So ridiculously cheap! Even if you go after the early bird dim sum, the deals here are still good. The food is decent but the service is rushed, and it definitely feels cramped (like too many tables?) so comfort isn't really high on their importance list.

They've got some really great lunch deals include $20 for a braised lobster noodle, a lobster fried rice, and a plate of vegetables. Seriously, $20. Or if you're one of the first twenty (?) tables, you can order a rice pot for $1 (but they choose which type of rice pot you get). So I mean, how can you go wrong?

This place is busy once 11am hits, and the staff are... nice enough, considering how rushed they are. It certainly feels cramped though, so be prepared to elbow it up at your table or to bump chairs with your neighbour. 

Worth it? I say yes. And their winning dish (besides the $20 set meal)? the egg yolk sesame ball dessert. Okay, now I want dim sum."}
{"text":"We were here for dinner for a family gathering (about 40 people or so) on a Saturday evening at 7:00.  All seats were full at the restaurant and I believe they were running some sort of special for about $250 per table for a 10 course meal.  To begin with, I typically do not like these \"set menu\" type of dinners because I am a picky person and would be happy to never see another piece of abalone for the rest of my life!

The courses included fruit salad (with some sort of mayonnaise on top), fish maw soup, steamed fish, lobster, abalone with green veggies, crispy chicken, e-fu noodles, fried rice, \"wu-gawk\" (yes my chinese is really that bad, it's a taro thing with a scallop inside and the outside looks kind of fuzzy). and another dish that must not have held my interest.  The dessert was one of the sweet soups and almond cookies (I could have ate the whole plate myself...did I mention I'm pregnant?).

The good: 
Lobster - this came on a huge plate and there was plenty for our table. The flavor was very good and the lobster wasn't \"old\". 
Crispy Chicken - I typically do not even eat one piece of crispy chicken and normally only go for shrimp chips because this dish is usually very dry to me, like sawdust crumbling in my mouth.  I am so glad I ate this dish, the chicken was moist and flavorful and I almost didn't notice that it didn't come with shrimp chips.
Taro Thing - I prefer this with ground meat, like it is typically served at dim sum, but the scallop was a nice twist and I would have ate two if there was another one available!
Almond Cookies - These were nice and crispy and had lots of almond flavor. I did have two of these, but resisted having more. 

The ok:
All the other dishes mentioned - many of these dishes, I don't really care for at any restaurant, so I can't say if they are fabulous or not.

The bad:
The service! Our reservation was for 7:00 and we arrived at 7:15 (the rest of the group was already seated).  I don't think we received our final course for at least two hours.  There were large gaps between the courses and large gaps between when our table and another in our party received the exact same dish. I am sure the reason for this must have something to do with the special on offer, but the kitchen just could not keep up. 

Overall, it was a good experience and next time we are in the area, it seems that this place could be a great option to try for dim sum!"}
{"text":"This review is just for dim sum.  We have never had dinner here but been for dim sum numerous times both on weekdays and weekends.  Sometime in the summer they introduced discounted dim sum throughout the afternoon and not just before 11 and after 1:30 like it used to be.  So it's 2.90 for everything even on weekends which makes it a pretty popular spot.  The food is always piping hot and fresh.  The selection is pretty good.  The only thing we had that wasn't so great was the chicken feet.  I can't explain why it wasn't good...it just didn't taste right.  The service however is sometimes slow and there's been a couple of times where our order didn't come out."}
{"text":"if we are talking strictly dim sum in the richmond hill area, the \"big 3\" has always been dragon boat fusion, premiere ballroom & convention center and golden court (in that order). However, this place might... JUST MIGHT..have dethroned golden court (it's typical for some dim sum dishes like shrimp dumplings to cost more but golden court took it to the next lvl with their wtf price inflations per dish). All dim sum priced the same here, regardless of size like Angel said.

Didnt realize it at first but this place has all-day dim sum (a plus for ppl who really need to satisfy that dim sum itch! lol).

overall: 3.5 stars

p.s. yikes, so many ppl complaining about their dinner experience... will prolly come back for dinner just to see for myself"}
{"text":"Plenty of small tables to accommodate couples and small parties; didn't wait more then a few minutes on a Saturday morning to get seated for 2. However larger parties waited well after we finished ordering (dim sum cart service not available, paper ordering only). 

I was promised great value and tasty dim sum by several of my colleagues. Overall I wasn't impressed, as some of our Dim Sum was lukewarm or cold in the centre. And if you can't read or understanding Chinese well, you might not be able to take advantage of their gimmicky specials. Such as order $XX amount of dim sum and get something at a discount or visit a number of time and get a percentage off the bill. Sounds like extreme desperation for business, but unfortunately I won't be returning to take advantage of them. Too many good dim sum places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Extremely nice furnishing. Classy seats and tables, utensils, and decor. There was also small TV screens in each room, which was quite nice.

In terms of food, the dim sum was pretty tasty as well, with a decent price. The variety is decent, pretty much what'd you expect at a good dim sum restaurant. The location was a little hard to find (you have to go up the stairs), but not a big deal.

Overall, a decent dim sum place to go to for groups. Not a bad place to go if you'd like to impress your friends."}
{"text":"I've been here for both Dim Sum and Dinner.

If you come before 11:30am it's cheaper.
however there is a very long wait, and those that made reservations have priority, I would NOT suggest waiting... just go somewhere else, it's not worth the way. The Dim Sum is nothing fancy or special. Just like all other Dim Sum menus.

The dinner, they have a lobster special, if you order $100+ you can add +20 for a 5lb lobster (and yes it's very big and delicious)

they will up sell you on the order of $100, so you will order over that amount, and it doesn't included fry noodles/fried rices etc, so after you order that $140 worth of food for the lobster, you have to order extra plain rice if needed. Comes with your family of 5 people +

the Peking Duck was pretty good, you see the person in front of you carving the duck, and the skin is very crispy, with nice thin wrappers.

however the other dishes lacked in skill, the honey oysters was gross, $20 for 6 pieces of mushy oysters, it was not crunchy/crispy with sweet honey taste like it supposed to be. The individual steamed oysters are a better choice in this case.

I enjoy the dinners here more than the afternoon tea."}
{"text":"I don't recall the last time I walked into a Chinese restaurant with a point exchange system at the front. It's been so many years. It kinda looks like a garage sale is going on. Perhaps that's what it is, although some of it is definitely a point exchange thing. There's a rack or two filled with odds and ends including assorted stuffed animals and if I recall correctly, some sort of thing that looks like pebbles for plants. 

Dim sum's fairly average here. Nothing particularly stood out. If anything, it was just slightly below average. That being said, they seem to have all the dim sum standards (until they run out of them). Phoenix talon/chicken feet were not the bright red I'm accustomed to. These ones were slightly less sweet and slightly more black bean flavored. 

They have a pine nut and green tea pastry on their dessert menu. It's actually more like a fried glutinous rice flour cake thing. It's got a mochi-esque texture, and it's covered in little (pine?) nut bits. The green tea is the floral kind, not the matcha kind. I was expecting something a lot more earthy, and a lot less like I just had some shampoo. Quite disappointed.

That being said, I wouldn't mind coming back because their taro nests filled with minced pork were quite tasty. Surprisingly, so were their steamed beef balls."}
{"text":"Food took forever to come out. 1/2 hr passed before even spring rolls came out. Took another 15 minutes before the next dish came. Food quality is average, not worth the price imo. The rice rolls and har gow wrappings fell apart when you try to pick it up. Siu Mai was lacklustre and seem to be factory made. Lots of MSG all around.  Service was sufficient and about the same as everywhere else. Place was packed (why) tho. Plenty of other places around that's better"}
{"text":"Most of these reviews aren't even relevant. Have you people ever been to a restaurant? The atmosphere, furnishing, temperature, decoration and EVERYTHING blows other restaurants out of the water. I've been to many Chinese restaurant in Scarborough, Markham, Richmond Hill, Newmarket, Aurora and Thornhill and NONE can compete with this one. There's a reason why it's sometimes rented out as a wedding ceremony place, karaoke, dance floor...etc. To put it into aspect, the ceiling is covered with chandeliers and expensive/good-looking glass decor. The floor is either beautifully carpeted or gold tiles (including the bathrooms). there's a nice view of uncleared nature from the 2nd story, and the walls are covered in embroidered wallpaper! There are also TVs everywhere to keep you entertained. The food itself is about the same price as any other place...but taste much better. So as you can see, there's really no con to this restaurant...they even have a reward program, as if you wouldn't come often anyways!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Everyone who works there shows a lot of courtesy. And the dim sum is very delicious. Would like to come back and try dinner. However...Once again, located near Highway 7 and Leslie, arrive early since this second floor restaurant is located in the midst of an extremely busy region, so it may be difficult to find parking during peak times."}
{"text":"I find this place a bit hard to find in the plaza, you gotta find the small door to get to the elevator/stairs; it's on the east side of the plaza.

As for space, it's pretty spacious and isn't very full. Many of the tables appear to be filled but it isn't bustling.

The food, pretty decent. They got some \"special\" items that are more expensive. Saw a pic by JenniferK of this abalone chicken flake; let me say the picture makes it look A LOT better than it really is. Expect a small litle thing in a bowl that is too big for the pastry. The pastry is more steamed bun as well. Not worth it in my opinion.

General standard fare is quite good like the shiu mai and har gow. The fried taro dumpling has chicken instead of pork and it taste very good. The curry cuttle fish is not really traditional cuttle fish but is like octopus legs is how I'd describe it.

In general this place is a little more expensive than your traditional place. It's not out of place for Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"3 stars overall...

Service. Food. Pricing.

Some of the food is quite delicious...such as the shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings are delish...

Others were an a-ok. Didn't like the pork stomach tips cuz they were a bit weird...the seating area is comfortable and a/c is turned on just right...

It's portraiting itself to be a posh restaurant but hard to say about how successful they are in that... 

No pressure to leave , watching game while being here. Which is nice. 

I gotta say Chinese dim sum places need to make more effort for better food. 

 Good for groups and private rooms also availible."}
{"text":"Came here once for dinner with my auntie and uncle.  The restaurant manager provided very friendly service.  My auntie and uncle came here with expectation but ended up were a bit disappointed with the food.  Honestly the dishes we ordered tasted fine but definitely no surprise."}
{"text":"I think every weekend now, I'm out with inlaws for dim sum. So in a way it's nice to try out new places and I get to yelp about it :) 

This restaurant is actually inside the Commerce Gate Plaza, inside the main building on the 2nd floor.  But the bad thing is there is no signage that indicates that it's on the 2nd floor. We were informed about this restaurant, so we were lucky to drive by and spot the signage upstairs. Once you are inside the building, you'll have to go up the escalators or take the elevator up.
Again no signage, so we had to guess where to go to seek for the restaurant entrance. 

The entrance itself only has the Chinese name, but on the side of a maintenance door, they slapped a temporary print out of the restaurant name with the English name.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very bright. But I think the decor is a bit tacky. There is a lot of gold but there is also full colour floral decor too..

The area where we were seated was a bit small and the tables were a bit close together. 

Their chopsticks were nice, but the rest of plates, bowls & drinking cups were all plain white. 

We ordered around 8 dishes, then the wait staff told us that if you order over 6 dim sum dishes, you can order the dim sum rice for only $1.50. Regular price is $4.95. So ya why not! 

The dim sum at first came out 1 by 1, but by the 3rd dish they came out quickly. Food in general is not bad. I can taste that they don't have much MSG and less salt which is great for elders. Their shrimp dumplings were huge, I think there was at least 2 whole shrimps inside, the skin was a bit thick but still ok. The siu mai (pork dumplings) were also big in size with a whole shrimp on each one. But I didn't like the thick glaze that was on top.

They also have a promo now where seniors in the month of April, tea is free for seniors only. 

When we got the bill they also gave us a discount card, where you collect stamps. Once you hit 16 stamps you get a free bag pf rice! Lol"}
{"text":"Been here for both dim sum and dinner.  The dim sum I would give it a 4/5 stars but the dinner is definitely a 2/5 only. That's why overall I'd give it a 3/5. Below are the reasons why: 

DIM SUM
Dim sum here is great. This place is one of our go to restaurants when it comes to dim sum. We tend to order the same food each time: har gow (shrimp dumplings), siu mai (they used to have it topped with scallops, now its with shrimps), BBQ pork buns, chicken feet and other typical dim sum foods. Most of the food is pretty good and service is quick. It can get busy on the weekends so make reservations if you can. 

DINNER
Every time we come for dinner, we tend to order the set dinners. It's not as good as the dim sum in my opinion. The food takes a while to come (as in it is VERY slow, if you are in a rush this is not a place I would recommend). The food was a bit too salty for my taste and the red bean soup was really diluted down. 

If you come here enough you tend to get free stuff. We got oysters the other day during dinner. They also have a rewards program in that every time you come you can get 1-2 stamps. After you collect enough stamps you can redeem prizes. We usually just get rice but they have other things like citrus juicer, dolls, etc. It's a cool concept if you ask me."}
{"text":"As of late, the quality and service of this place has gone way down for the dim sum hours. Not sure if the chef has left or change of management, but food was being brought out cold and portions were inconsistent."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum at 11:45am and waited until 12:35pm and not a single dish came out. We complained 3 times to tell the kitchen to speed up the service but still nothing. This is unacceptable. This must be the slowest kitchen in the world. If you want to eat in a timely manner do not come here. I left after almost an hour without eating and will never be back again. Terrible."}
{"text":"King Dragon Cuisine restuarant is HARD to find.  It is located on the 2nd floor.  The non-descriptive entrance is located in the west end of the building.  Fortunately, there is a big sign on top of the entrance that tells you there is a restaurant on the 2nd floor.  Yet you have to find that hole in the wall, naming the door of the entrance, first to see the sign.  Rant done.  

Once we overcame the challenge of finding the restaurant, I saw a glamorously decorated interior.  The ambiance screams that the restaurant wants customers who vaunt their wealth.  There is no grace or taste in the collection of glittering decoration, in my opinion.

Having said all these, why the 4 stars?  The food.  The quality of the dinner food here is decent.  We ordered 3 entrées for dinner.  I forgot their names.  I recalled that they were well made. well seasoned and well portioned.  The ingredients were of reasonable quality.  The vegetable was very fresh.  The hot pot was piping hot.  The food reminded me of the food of some middle-high end restaurants in Hong Kong, but in Toronto it is featured in a restaurant that presents itself as a high end restaurant.  The only other Chinese restaurant in the vicinity that boosts similar food quality is Judy Cuisine, with Judy's food slightly more contemporary and better made.  The services at King Dragon is better, though.  

So yes, I recommend King Dragon for dinner.  It is more expensive than average, but the portion makes up for it.  The services is good.  The ambiance is, well, subject to your personal preference."}
{"text":"Pretty typical dim sum restaurant. I saw many pictures that were posted that got my interest like the layer cake but sadly it was not on the menu anymore. Service was a tad slower than other dim sum restaurants. All the staff were working really hard but I think there is not enough workers. Almost everyone working there look like they were having the worst day ever. 

No real complaints about the food but nothing really special to point out either. Just average."}
{"text":"This review is for dim sum only. I came in for morning tea, and the food was below average. With this price per dish, there are places with much higher quality foods. A highlight of the main offenders: the dough of my har gow completely fell apart (but the shrimp was cooked \"al dente\", if you know what I mean); the dumpling in soup had canned mushrooms, foods that were definitely not seafood, and really bad and crusty dough; and lastly, the curry cuttlefish had a pubic hair in it. Will not be back, and I definitely do not recommend coming for tea."}
{"text":"I had dim sum here on a weekend, and it was super packed and busy. It took a while to get a seat, but it is the norm at most dim sum places on the weekend.

Some of the dishes were great; the har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) were super delicious and jumbo sized. The siu mai (pork) also had a shrimp on top, which was definitely nice. Overall, the quality of food was good; they also currently have a deal where all dim sum dishes are 2.90; which is very reasonable. There were some misses on dishes as well; the fish ball in watercress soup was seriously under flavoured and bland. 

The customer service was average; they were all friendly, however - the food came out really slow (compared to other places). As well, we ordered durian puff deserts, and they didn't tell us they sold out. As such, we waited a long time before they told us.

I would recommend coming here for dim sum, but maybe come on the weekdays when there is less people?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their dim sum. The price isn't bad either ($2.90 for S, M or L). The place is often crowded and you should probably call ahead to book a seat before you go if you plan to go on a weekend. the wait staff are very friendly and very polite. 

My favourite dish of theirs would have to be their Deep Fried Milk. They make it just they way I like it with milk inside is still steaming when you bite into it. ^_^"}
{"text":"After trying to go to Dragon Boat Fusion Cuising at east beaver creek (it was a 1hr wait for less than 10 ppl in line.. their tables are all large and they seat two people at them..), I opted for this place nearby which had many tables open. Decent food, great service. Free asian newspaper. Special prices before 11:30am. The pumpkin congee was sooo good with big sandy chunks and the chestnuts were an excellent combination. For the rice noodle roll, the ratio of filling and noodle was good and the consistency was not bad! Decor is nice and everything is clean. Waiters are polite and quick. The 5 star is an overall rating considering many factors including availability of seats, service, and above average in quality of food. I would definitely come back and recommend hands down."}
{"text":"Came here with my in laws because we wanted to try a different dim sum place. As others have stated, the restaurant was hard to find unless you go directly to the underground parking. It is an ok size, not too big not too small and the tables were not crowded together. The dim sum was delicious except for the BBQ pork bun that did not taste that fresh. I really enjoyed the chicken with spinach siu mui.  The price was also reasonable."}
{"text":"For your everyday dimsum, this place isn't bad at all. They've got a good selection of dimsum, including my faves of spare ribs, Har gow and bbq pork puff pastry,  and they have good customer incentive programs going on. Regulars have a VIP stamp card to collect points to redeem for items (bags of rice, toys etc), and they also give %off coupons for next visits. The biggest one I've seen is 40% off, which can be used for dinner... Not too shabby at all! I love being seated near the window, because unlike other dimsum places, they've got a bit of a view, overlooking a little Creek and some of Highway 7.

Oh and all dimsum is $2.90 per dish, no matter of size, starting at 1:30 everyday of the week! Awesome deal!"}
{"text":"King Dragon Cuisine, opened recently at Commerce Gate does have an interesting dim sum menu.

This location used to be Commerce Gate Dynasty and King Dragon did a complete renovation and it looked totally different from the previous business. A lot of glossy marble, sparkling crystals and more lighting.

We were here for dim sum, as it is 10% off with complimentary tea. There are some interesting dim sum items on the menu and we ordered a few to share:

Pork Dumpling w/Scallop (L)
Barbecued Pork Bun (S)
Abalone w/Chicken Meat Pastry ($3.90 each)
Truffle w/Shrimp Dumpling ($2.90 each)
Creamy Coffee Pudding (S)
Durian Pudding (M)

Overall the dim sum are of good quality. I would be back for more.

Cleanliness and attention to details though need some work. The plates were kind of dirty with a gluey film on top and one of the bowls has some leftover bean sprout in it??! The staff that set up the table should have caught those... dirty dishes are just gross!!

For dinner, you can order a 4 headed abalone for $750. I might have to pass on that for the time being.

Apparently the Chef used to work at Lai Wah Heen, so you might find some of the similar offerings."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum. The food is pretty good, and well prepared.  They have all the standard dim sum fare but they also toss in a few unique items. This time we had a green tea paste that they shaped like leaves. Tasted like very concentrated green tea. 

Its always busy there bit the kitchen manages to get dishes out rather quickly,  and very well done, not just slapped together.  The only hold ups we have ever had was with the wait staff getting the food to the tables quickly. They sometimes don't have enough staff so service is slow. 

But the food us great. Thumbs up, would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's ooooooookay here. I visited recently for dim sum and again for dinner. The dinner, don't even bother! It's bad. Set dinners (decent price for large families) with the usual dishes: fish, chicken. We had peking duck here, it was actually decent. Maybe 3 stars for that.

The fish was gross!! It tastes a tad off.
Chicken was meatless. The fried chicken was overdone so the skin was tough and thick.
Fried noodles and rice were very, very plain. I've never had plainer fried rice than this place. It felt like it was made in a rush. I guess on the positive side, it's less in sodium!! (Hopefully??)

Soup was nice, I've had better.

Dim sum was acceptable. Afternoon service is fantastic though. My godmother visits here all the time. They make this pumpkin congee that tastes pretty nice. I dislike both pumpkin and congee but I was able to eat theirs without puking. I even ate two bowls of it! 

This restaurant is located upstairs, dimly lit fluorescence lighting. Like a haunted office with flickering lights. The restaurant itself is quite dark, perhaps to save lighting bills. After all it has a few small chandeliers!"}
