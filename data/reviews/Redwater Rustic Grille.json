{"text":"Awesome awesome location in Aspen Landing

Finding a parking spot in this complex can be challenging though. 

You walk in at the top level and head downstairs to the hostess stand. The dining room and lounge overlook the pond and get a slight mountain view on a clear day. 

We ended up going to brunch here because our local favourite haunts had ridiculous wait times and remembered that red water recently launched a brunch service. 

Service was a 4 out of 5, all staff were competent and friendly. 

I ordered the huevro red water, the eggs cooked perfectly and the maple BBQ sauce was super tasty and wish it came with more.   Oh forgot to mention the complimentary yogurt, fruit and banana bread thing. 

It was a nice surprise and touch. Overall really enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Contemporary upscale decor and really fine food. I chose the chimichurra as the sauce for salmon and it was delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly. With two choices of sides, I had the broccolini and the squash - they don't take potatoes for granted - yay.  My dinner companion had a steak with brandy peppercorn sauce and one of his sides was an elegant scalloped potato dish. This is a restaurant with imagination. Classics done well and lots of twists - perhaps most exemplified in the dessert menu: Maple Pumpkin Crème Brulé, Dupre Chocolate Cake (Vegan) w strawberry sorbet, Amaretto White Chocolate Cheesecake w dark chocolate swirl, Warm Caramel Banana Bread Pudding. Nice wine list, helpful but unobtrusive staff. We're going back again soon - to this Stadium location even though it's out of the way."}
{"text":"Came here for my convocation celebration service was great and the food was awesome.


I had the strip and shrimp with mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked the way I wanted it and seasoned just enough. The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly. 

The portions were on the smaller scale for the price but I was full after my meal so I left with a full belly. Our server was so sweet and so accommodating to any dietary issues and other requests. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Awsome food and very clean decor. Caution parking can be hard to find when Stampeders are playing"}
{"text":"This is a strange restaurant.
I mean, take for example the last time I was there.
Strange, because I ended up with a table on the patio...which is inside the mall of Bow Valley Square.
And strange, because you're sitting on leather chairs, watching people walk by...but indoors.
Even more strange is the chef's interpretation of the menu descriptions - I ordered the Southwest Pulled Chicken BLT...and it was a cold chicken salad sandwich.
Now, I'm not saying that strange is bad, it's just bizarre.  The sandwich is quite good - I've ordered it more than once - I like the zip of the mustard dressing and the nice sweet taste of the chicken salad.  But I was expecting a hot chicken breast on a bun.
Either way, this place has a really nice vibe to it.  Its interior is dark, cozy and hip, and the food is high quality and always tasty."}
{"text":"I was there on a recommendation from itsdatenight.com. Tuesday nights they serve bottles of premium wine for $20.00. There were about 6 selections and we found one we liked to pair with appetizers. 

We had the scallops (my dates favorite!), stuffed mushrooms (my favorite!), delicious soup and the beet salad. Everything was spectacular! The truffle oil in the beet salad was delicious, although I did find it a little sweet, so probably too much honey for my taste. The fresh, still warm, in house baked sour dough bread was so good I could have eaten ten loaves! 

Service was very attentive, very friendly and knowledgable. The restaurant itself had a nice quiet ambiance. 

I'd definitely go back. The only thing I'd change is to add some more complex flavors or combinations to the menu. As it stands, it's very down-to-earth and wholesome."}
{"text":"Red Water is an absolutely beautiful restaurant where I definitely recommend people to check it out.  After I walked and drove past a number of Red Water locations, I have been wanting to go to it for sometime.  The only thing that held me back in going was the apprehension that it would be like so many other restaurant franchises (*cough cough* Metropolitan, Moxies, Earls), who cater to the public through the use of atmosphere and decor rather than through the avenue of creating good food.

It just happened so that my boyfriend's birthday was fast approaching.  Being in the position where I had no idea what to get him and didn't have the time to buy presents, it was a perfect opportunity to take him out to Red Water and get that stupid steak dinner that he would so jokingly hint about.  The northwest location in Calgary is like a hidden gem amongst a pile of rocks; with it's fanciness it looks a little out of place in a shopping plaza of older businesses.  Walking in, you'll notice right away Red Water's open layout, where tables are nicely spaced apart on the floor as u-shaped booths line the wall.  With a darker colour scheme, splashes of red and off-whites colour the room to give an intimate and comfortable feeling.  Although I wouldn't say Red Water is an upscale restaurant, it definitely caters to a dressier and more mature crowd (when I mean mature, I mean not being annoying idiots in a restaurant).  Although it isn't necessary to get dressed up, it is within the stated dress code.    

Unlike other restaurant chains, Red Water executed in giving great service as well as great food.  The waitress we got that night was extremely professional and knowledgeable of the menu.  My boyfriend and I both ordered wine, and upon it being poured, the waitress did ask if we wanted a taste test to ensure that it was right to our palette.  With dinner, I was not disappointed where Red Water lives up to its \"rustic grille\" and \"steakhouse\" title; I ordered a scallop and shrimp dish while the birthday boy ordered a steak...both dishes were cooked to perfection with great tasting sides and sauces.  Unlike most steakhouses like the Keg where they serve a dish 90% meat and 10% sides,  Red Water served a good balance of portions with beautiful presentation.  Like what other people have said, the menu offers great choices in mixing traditional classic dishes with a modern and inventive twist in flavour.  For those that are vegetarian or have a gluten-free diet, don't shy away from this restaurant where they have a few choices to choose from.  The cost of items is quite reasonable, but not exactly cheap - ranging from the $14 to $40 mark of the main course meals, do be prepared to spend a little more.  The bill for the two of us was around $88.00, however it was definitely worth the price in both service and food.  Although this won't become my go-to place, I will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Redwater was the perfect setting for a recent birthday party I attended. The decor was gorgeous and we had our own semi-private dining room for the evening. The service was excellent with our waiter giving some good advice when choosing our entrees. We started with some appies: Margarita Lime Chicken Tacos and bruschetta. Both were amazing. For dinner, I decided to go with the chef's special. It was a New York striploin served on a bed of duck confit risotto. My steak was a little overdone but the risotto was good. They have a great wine selection here. To go with my dinner, I had a glass of St. Urbans-Hof riesling and it was simply amazing. We ended the night with some flourless chocolate cake and cappuccino. Redwater is not cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I continue to love this place. I had dinner here with friends from out of town and they quite enjoyed the experience. Because I'm a creature of habit, I had to have the same entrée I had on my last visit. Redwater did not disappoint! They are definitely consistent. My 10oz New York striploin was cooked to perfection and the balsamic vinegar reduction that decorated the plate was just amazing! It made the already flavourful garlic poblano butter just that much better. At this rate, I'm not sure I want to try anything else on their menu. The steak was just that good."}
{"text":"I had salmon w/ seasonal vegetables and fries, fiancé had 8 oz tenderloin with mac and cheese. Sides were sold separately and a little pricey for the size of them? Dessert: we had the creme brûlée, it was infused with cranberry which I wasn't absolutely crazy about and it was pretty runny but it was yummy! Would love to try the plain one. We also had the Sandhill Pinot Gris which was phenomenal! Waitress was so friendly and checked in on us just the right amount. We paid about $115 in total, plus tip. A little on the pricier side, especially when you consider that the food isn't totally gourmet. (Obviously we wouldn't go there every weekend. But worth it once in a while!)"}
{"text":"Best date place ever!! 
My husband and I go to Redwater a few times a year as a special date night (anniversary etc) and we have never been disappointed. The service is always great but the food is the best part. 
We have never had a poorly cooked meal ever and the menu selections are always delicious, seasonal and fresh. 
Portions do not leave you feeling bloated or stuffed but they are not too small either. 
The atmosphere is nice and the wine selection is plentiful. 
I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Very, very good food... but you pay a hefty bill for it. Everything is delicious, well presented, perfectly cooked. The menu items are delightful and are such fun to dive into. Definitely make a reservation, or else you won't get a table (as mentioned, this is a very trendy joint)."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received. Who gives a new server 6 tables on the patio? I did feel sorry for him but literally we had no refilled drinks, no cutlery at one point, no salt and pepper without asking...we were afraid to ask for anything because we knew we would never get it! And in fact we never received part of our order. Meanwhile the manager is putting up umbrellas in shady areas in front of us where we are sat with empty drinks! He never offered to help the new kid and when he asked how our brunch was...we said \"ok\"...he never even asked why or what the issue was! Poor management. At least food was good because we were never asked for any drinks after our first ones."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Nice atmosphere and very clean. 

Now for the bad. I ordered the ribeye which was not even editable. 

Now for the good. The waitress saw me struggling and came over and apologized. They took away the steak. The manager came over. She said they could plainly see it was a bad cut. They recommended the sirloin and offered me an appetizer while I waited. The second steak was very great. 

Given the way the situation was handled I gave them 4 stars and I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I went to the downtown one, i think it is call Bow Vally, for my friend's birthday party, it was on a Friday, but the restaurant was not busy at all. We had a reservation, because we need a big table and we had 8 people together, otherwise i don't think the reservation was necessary because there were a lot of empty seats.

The atmosphere was good, and quiet, but the first server ( we had two servers) was not friendly at all. We waited about half hour, because one of our friends was late. The first female server seemed vary impatient, she asked us couple times when we were ready to order, and we had to tell her that we need to wait for another one. i don't know if it was the end of her shift, or she just wanted to rush to home, but we need to wait until all the people come to start ordering.

After that the first server just left us behind and disappeared, even though all the people came and we were ready to order and nobody took care of us. Then the second server showed up and took all the orders. the second one was very good. one of us dropped the camera's screen cover on the floor, and the server helped us search around for almost 2 minutes and finally we found it.

the food was fantastic. I order the duo of wild shrimp & sea scallops. the seafood tested fresh, appropriate cooked,and came with the side of pasta and seasonal vegetables, but it was kind of small, recommend order with other appetizers. Most of my friends order their steaks, and they all satisfied. while we were dining, the second server keep coming and served us perfectly."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience after 3 hours we finally got our last meal to take out. Service was non-existent. Don't go"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. Not too many people in our party of 8 actually finished their plates - I don't know if this means the portions were huge ... but personally, I think the food wasn't worth the extra calories hence why so many of us didn't finish our plates of food. I don't think it was worth the ridiculous price they charge. Beautiful view. Service was okay but could have been improved. Other locations are better. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great, but I was expecting more... I reminds me of Moxies or Earls... I'm picky thought as I am a cook myself.."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for mother's day. When we arrived we were told that the only meal option was the buffet. This would have been fine had the website mentioned this. Being a diabetic buffets are a waste of money. The 30$ was overpriced for the quality of food provided. Disappointed with what is usually one of our favourite places to eat."}
{"text":"Over priced in light of the inconsistency in quality and menu items. I have had mostly good meals here and good service. The cost is greater than the value. 

But I  have a real \"beef\" with their meatballs. :)

They used to make some great bison meatballs that I loved and constantly visited just knowing I would enjoy them even if the meal wasn't up to snuff. They took the bison meatballs off the menu in favor of beef. When I asked I was told they sold very well but mysteriously disappeared. 

IMO the one thing that made this restaurant not just another beef joint was the bison meatballs. I don't go there anymore because I can get just as good of food from other restaurants without the 30 percent premium -- and for what?

I tried the beef meatballs and I don't like them at all. The marinara sauce they use on them is perfect for the bison flavor but clashes with the beef."}
{"text":"Always an amazing meal.  Try the pork.  It is blow your mind good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! A big treat while on our business trip. Ordered the ahi tuna and savoured every bite!"}
{"text":"This is a good, not great, restaurant. I keep going back mainly because it is the only decent restaurant to take my guests (visiting scientists, recruitment candidates, etc.) to that is within walking distance of the Foothills & Children's Hospitals.  The menu has a reasonable assortment of pastas, steaks, and continental entrees. The service, decor and plating are upscale, but the main problem is that the food preparation & quality is inconsistent.  For example, I have ordered the 6oz tenderloin with yam fries a few times: some times it's fantastic, other times the meat is chewy and flavourless.  The fries have been crispy sometimes, flaccid others.  The menu boasts that the side stripe prawn garganelli is made with \"sustainable shrimp\", which would appear to derive from the fact that they caught and cooked virtually no shrimp to make this pasta dish.  The butternut squash agnolotti on the other hand are really nice..salty and earthy.  Long story short, you may have a 4 star meal here based on the potential of the menu and setting, but it's not guaranteed in my experience."}
{"text":"Made reservation one week previous. Hot eve for Calgary. Told when asked about the patio to be seated that you can't reserv these tables. What!  Those who don't reserv get first choice. Not impressed as you can tell."}
{"text":"Tasty appetizer, interesting desserts, well prepared but standard entrees.

Both the baked brie and mushroom dip were quite good and very quickly inhaled by everyone at the table.

The main dishes were the standard steak, chicken, fish and lamb. Having said that, the portion sizes were decent and properly cooked. 

The desserts was where redwater really shined. The warm caramel banan bread pudding was drop dead decadent and delicious.    

Overall good meal but not amazing."}
{"text":"The Bow Valley location has great food I will give it that. Unfortunately the service is SLOW SLOW SLOW. If you have 2-3 hours for dinner and 2 hours for lunch this is a great place to go. I have been here several times when time was not an issue so the slow service did not really bother me however recently we went for a work dinner, 12 people. We were seated in a separate room that I am assuming from the large TV on the wall and all the cords hanging from it is used for conference meetings. There were maybe 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant - including the lounge. We were told we would have 2 servers. 15 minutes after we got our menus 1 server came back to take our order, 15 minutes after that we got our drinks, another 15 minutes after that the acting manager came in to tell us there was no roasted chicken left for those who had ordered it .... really our order was put in over a half an hour ago and it took you that long to figure out you were out of chicken!?! Should you not know this before the table even sits down and let those ordering know when the menus are given out!?! Our 1 waitress was very good but slow and service was somewhat scattered, some of us got drink refills, some of us did not, those drinking alcohol got refills however with one of the guests his beer re-order came while he was having dessert. All the food did come at once and was all placed on the table at once - I think the entire wait staff that night was used in order to do that. 

Bottom line, the food is excellent but only go to this location if you have time to kill."}
{"text":"We have been to the MacLeod Trail location several times for special occasions (Valentine's Day, Birthday, etc). I have also been several times for work lunches. I have always found the food to be excellent and the service to be very good. We have had appetizers, main courses and desserts and all the food is excellent. It is a very busy location so I would recommend reservations. The atmosphere can be on the loud side but great décor and it is a city restaurant. The menu changes occasionally."}
{"text":"The food and service are spot on. My dining partner wanted to hug the chef after devouring the Bison Meatballs with its lip smacking good sauce.
These guys are doing it right! If you love wine and food stop in soon."}
{"text":"Wow. My mushroom risotto is wow. It comes with a truffle oil and fresh grated Parmesan. The flavors come through clear, strong, and oh- so- good. If you go to Redwater, you (or a member of your party) needs to order it. The roasted tomato and corn soup was great, and the warm scallops on a salad was yummy. They have an alcoholic drink that was essentially lemonade with ginger. A member of my party thought it was okay, but would not order the drink again. The decor is clean, sleek- rustic made modern. Our waitress, Anna, was very knowledgeable, telling us that the ravioli sauce was a bit bland, what about the seafood risotto?"}
{"text":"Disappointed!!

Waitress could not wait to get us out of there and it was early and the place was empty.  Can I take your drinks appetizers, and mains order now so I don't have to come back?   

Crab cakes were not good, very fishy taste.  I figured it could be fixed with the filet experience.  I ordered the big filet, going to turn the dinner into a big success.  Their order instructions were very clear, I go for broke and order rare with the Romaine heart salad to start. Order of mushrooms on the side. Mmmmmmmm. 

Guess they had too much time in the kitchen.  Salad arrives with all the mains - no real apology - too bad for me. Steak is well done and I mean extra well done. Mushrooms have so much salt on them, I give up on them - a crab couldn't digest them.  

Everyone eats food. I'd had the salad first so as to salvage what I could of the meal.  Not much heart, mostly leaf.  I think the plate was warm and the lettuce died before it made it to my table. People eat, I look at their food hungrily.  Wife gives me half her meal.  

Steak comes, extra rare but that's OK. I want to go home and finish cooking it along with a side I can eat.  The next day I do just that. 

Summary, qualification required to serve at a class restaurant is to have eaten in one and not had your parents always pay the bill. Next, offer of extra ketchup does not compensate for a poor total experience. Tab was $275 for 4. Not only was expected to pay for everything, I think an apology costs the customer a $20.  

I vow to never return. Suggest you seek out some place from all the great alternatives."}
{"text":"The Redwater Rustic Grille is a blissed-out sanctuary amidst the noise and gaudiness of Calgary's MacLeod Trail. The earthy tones of wood and stone give the restaurant its warm rustic charm while the clean design and tasteful décor suggest urban sophistication. The diners are attired in everything from suits to jeans and smooth jazz drizzles out of the speakers.

The spectacular cylinder of glass reaching from floor to ceiling is a full wine cooler stocked with a variety of boutique and renowned labels ranging from $10 per glass to $350 per bottle. I start off with a glass of instant bliss; Bridlewood Reserve Viognier. There are consistently several servers in sight, all unabashed about stopping by tables outside their section to ensure the comfort of diners. Speaking with several servers over the course of the evening, I found them all knowledgeable, friendly and professional. And in a chef and sommelier driven award-winning restaurant like Redwater, they should be.

Redwater Executive Chef Christian Penno has been an onsite presence since 2006 and a familiar name on the Calgary culinary scene for 15 years. Christian and his crew are charged with the Grille's seasonal menu of rustic regional cuisine that features fresh foods from local distributors. The chef's robust dishes include pizzas, pastas, Alberta beef, bison, seafood, soups and salads, but again, the menu changes seasonally according to availability.

We are presented with a complimentary serving of warm oven baked wholegrain bread and Redichi, Redwater's signature spread of sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, roasted red peppers, basil, beets and other savory ingredients. It's delicious enough to set off little fireworks in my brain. I also try an appetizer of Margarita Lime Chicken Tacos with a lively Minted Pico de Gallo sauce and invigorating Cilantro Cream. As if the place isn't sexy enough already, the entrees are served naked, meaning they are accompanied by your choice of sauces and two side dishes. After much waffling over the lavish possibilities, I opt for Wild Shrimp and Scallops in Chili Garlic Butter with Forno Roasted Button Mushrooms and Sautéed Broccolini, which arrived nicely portioned and cooked to perfection, tasting fantastic individually and phenomenal together.

Prices range from a $7 soup to the $38 Bison Rib Eye and every morsel that I sampled from the Pan Seared Scallop Warm Spinach Salad to dessert was packed with favour. Like many Redwater diners, I was eager to experience as much cuisine as I could. The restaurant offers a desert sampler featuring your choice of three sweet creations presented in shooter glasses. Selecting Tiramisu, Mango Sorbet and Triple Chocolate Mousse with Mango Filling, my sweet tooth was happy enough with the variety to dance a jig.

When it comes to flavour, presentation, ambiance, skilled service and price, Redwater Rustic Grille delivers on all fronts. This a superb place to feast in Calgary's Southeast."}
{"text":"I love redwater! Upscale/casual setting with good service. I love the fact that they use a lot of all natural ingredients (which will keep me coming back for sure). Great wine list too!"}
{"text":"I don't often frequent this place because it is always busy but I really like the atmosphere. The feeling is calm and lively in the evening hours, I've only been here two times and both times the food was served hot and fresh and the service was fast. 

Their Caesar Salad is absolutely delicious and one of the best, if not the best, Caesar Salad I have tried in town. I usually order the Sunrise Farms Chicken with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and find that the chicken is very fresh, light. The mash potatoes are also fluffy and very delightful. Somewhere to go if you are spending a quiet winter evening with your SO or a couple of friends."}
{"text":"We did not try any of the desserts as the mains filled us up.  The food was quite nice, we have had better but not at this price.  We will go again."}
{"text":"Great service from our server. The staff were sweet about accommodating us with our child for an early NYE meal. We went because my husband takes his clients for a quick lunch (usually burger & fries) and said it was good. As a ex-chef, I trust his choices. Food was...ok. Not the worst nor the best meal ever. I thought the food was ok until I got violently ill 4-5 hours after at around 10:30-11:00pm. Was it the food handling? I don't know but I was fine by about 1:30 am when my stomach settled. It is possible but not for sure that this was the source since my husband had exactly the same food all day-he prepared at home (he has food handling courses and experience).  Also, I had no other symptoms after. We are super hand washers and use hand sanitizer all the time. I know a sneeze could transfer germs but I try to be cautious, avoiding ill people. Luckily, what my husband and child had didn't make them sick. My child said (after crying until I stopped vomitting), \"No more Redwater\" I am not sure about that, but, it was a New Year's Eve I hope to soon forget. Note: I had one alcoholic drink, a small glass of wine. This was the only alcohol I had that day/night. A nurse confirmed it could be related to food handling, for example someone passed germs or was ill...I will consider trying this place again in the future. Staff deserve five stars because they were super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago for my work's Christmas party. There was 13 of us, so we were a bigger group. But our server Kasey did a great job of checking up on us and always made sure we had everything we needed. 

We started with some appies. We had the Mini Bruschetta, Brie in Phyllo, Crab Cakes and Bacon wrapped scallops. For the most part, they all were tasty. My favorite was the Brie in Phyllo. The cranberry added a nice tartness to the creaminess of the Brie. The Crab cakes were alright. I personally found they were quite greasy and the fish wasn't very fresh. But that is to be expected in a land locked province! I got the tomato soup to start, and it was nice and light. I had the Steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The steak was cooked perfectly and I love me some good mashed potatoes. I finished the meal with the White Chocolate Cheesecake. All I can say is YUM. So so good, I would order that again. I liked that it came with a gooseberry, as it helped to offset all the sweetness in the cheesecake. It was a great way to end the meal.

Overall, we had a lovely dinner and it was great going out with all my coworkers. My only complaint would be the Crab cakes were a bit disappointing. Also we got there at 5 (when our reservation was for), and the doors were locked. There was at least 20 people outside waiting to go inside and we finally had the Coca Cola delivery guy let us in. If it wasn't for him, who knows how long it would have been for all of us to get in. Otherwise, Kasey took wonderful care of us and it was a good way to start off a fun evening."}
{"text":"I've never actually written a review on anything before but I am so upset, I took the time out of my work day to do so.  Had a company function at this location.  Food wasn't too bad and the service was actually pretty good.  What made my blood boil was the manager on staff.  I leave after lunch to discover a parking ticket on my car.  When I went back in to the restaurant to inquire the manager immediately goes off on a tangent about how they will not cover it, they have signs all over the place, it's not their fault, there is nothing they can do, etc.... 

Not only does she come off extremely confrontational but does so right in front of other guests.  This took what was a pleasant experience in the restaurant and turned it on it's head.  

Not only will I never go back, I will go out of my way to share this experience with family and friends.  

WOW, pretty brutal."}
{"text":"I only recently learned that this restaurant was part of the Vintage Group. Now it makes sense why it's so good! I have only been to the one on Macleod Trail. I understand that there is a location downtown and another one somewhere in the NW. 

My review is restricted to the Macleod Trail Restaurant as I've been there a number of times for lunch. Going there has always been an absolute pleasure and delight. There is ample parking, the interior decor and design, is very elegant, unique and distinguishing. The ambience is one of upscale casualness bordering close to fine dining. Always pleasant and attentive service. And I've found the servers very attentive and very clued up about the menu and wine list. Oops. No, they do not have a list. They definitely have a Wine Menu. 

An amazing and superb collection of new world wines, and of course, our traditional European favourites. Some very affordable wines for a lunch break, to some very robustly priced wine for closing those special business deals, and of course, when you are having a three hour dinner, celebrating a very special occasion. As a sweet tooth, I was also most impressed with their fine selection of ports and desert and ice wines.

 I have not even spoken about the food yet! Their food appears freshly and locally sourced and prepared, and tastes the way fresh food should taste! teasing the palate with sensational flavours and lingering aromas. They have an unusual selection of bison meatballs and bison burgers, feta lamb burgers, and things you simply don't see on menus in other local restaurants. My favourite incidently, is their Pan Seared Scallop Warm Spinach Salad. Their Roasted Tomato and Golden Corn Soup is also superb! 

They are not cheap, but the service and food are superb and well priced for the location. So take a drive down Macleod. Try it, you will not be disappointed. You'll leave with a knowing smile on your face!!!"}
{"text":"We had a date night here the other day. Really really perfect steak. The appetizer of \"tiger prawn shrimps\" was delicious but definitely not tiger prawns and definitely not worth $17 (for 6 small shrimp). It was delicious though! 
Also had the maple BBQ sauce and the peppercorn sauce with our steaks and they were both so good we asked for more! 
Great service too! Over all I think we will be back."}
{"text":"Like has been said already....where to start...
Had a birthday dinner planned, mine lol and I was the youngest at 54...

So, for a bunch of oldies and goodies we found this place to be excellent. They seated everyone with space between so we had privacy, the food was excellent....just the right amount and was not plates heaped with food....the atmosphere was also excellent.....not too dark yet not too bright....as much as other restaurants are also good but have a loud noisy atmosphere this was a nice modest level of noise....and the service....well all I can say is it was fantastic....there but not hovering, knowledgeable, and had a sense of humour...giving and taking....

So, if you were to ask me if I would go back??.....resounding yes"}
{"text":"So delicious, party in your mouth.  Great for going with a bunch of friends to share Appetizers."}
{"text":"Food was great, waitress was great, view was great... Then a spider crawled across my plate. Needless to say loss of appetite.  Was surprised they didn't offer to comp meal let alone apologize."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, wonderful food!

It was our date night so we got all dolled up and took ourselves here for a nice meal. Unfortunately we did it during the Calgary Stampede which means every worker in the city has to dress like they work on a farm, which I don't like at all, but I can't blame them for that. I love the Calgary Stampede, it just needs to stay on the stampede grounds and not in every restaurant in the city. 

We had booked a reservation just in case but it was a super quite night when we arrived. The environment was very charming and the staff were very friendly and made us feel very comfortable. We ordered and it didn't take any longer than I would expect for such lovely food to be prepared. I had an amazing margherita flatbread (they were cheap on the basil, next time I am asking for extra) and my partner described their dish as \"the best salmon I've ever had!\". We ordered dessert as well and at first I was super disappointed in how tiny it was but then I tasted it and it blew me away! The name is too long for me to recall but I believe the server just called it the \"Blondie\". It was SO tasty."}
{"text":"Came back for a second time this week. brought some friends. everyone enjoyed it (not surprised at all) we all got steaks!!. so goood Onenof the best steaks in Calgary hands down!. I want everyone to try it atleast once you won't regret it!!! SO GOOD I WANT TO AMERICAN PIE THESE STEAKS hahaha!."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where to start....

The place itself is beautiful, the lighting very intimate and staff are unbelievably professional. I went there for my eighteenth birthday almost three years ago and have been hard pressed to go somewhere else for any special occasion.

I generally go there for their steak, as it is absolutely one of the best I have ever had. I would recommend the rib eye with a shrimp skewer, broccolini and buttermilk mashed potatoes. I generally get a side of Bearnaise sauce, but that's just me.

My boyfriend got the chicken Oscar and he said it was delicious.

Their wine selection is awesome and the waitress was able to help me select a bottle that fit perfectly with my meal and my tastes.

We shared a double chocolate brownie and that was so yummy.

We left full, happy and with a desire to return, as is the norm with this place.

Recommended for a date night, business dinner/lunch, or just a general celebration!"}
{"text":"Our meals were absolutely delicious. Shrimps, scallops, steaks, vegetables, as well as desserts and cocktails were all done to perfection. 
Top this off with some of the best wait staff ANYWHERE and you have a 5 star experience"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here, and have to say is was pretty near perfect. Great atmosphere and excellent service. The food was plated with care, I had a salmon dish (can't remember what it was exactly) with a side salad. Nice greens but the salmon stole the show. I agree with Erin D., the dishes here are perfectly portioned.

This is a great place for a business lunch, the volume level was just right for conversing. it's busy during the lunch hour so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Have eaten at both locations many times. The menu offers a good selection and the dishes have always been delicious. Fairly extensive wine list. It's dark and cozy like one might expect a steak house to be."}
{"text":"The food was great they did have some good vegetarian options however the service wasn't an impressive. The table we have reserved was given away to a bigger party without any notification. Orders kept getting mixed up and the table was never cleaned. So to summarize it, i loved the food but wouldn't go back because of the poor service."}
{"text":"I've been to Redwater in the south and twice to the NW one, and every time I have had an enjoyable experience. The contemporary decor and dim lights really make for a relaxing dinner and put you at ease. The servers are often very professional and knowledgeable about the menu, which always helps.

The only thing that bugged me though: On my last visit to the NW Redwater I was with one other person and we were seated in the middle of the restaurant where they have a few sets of really large red chairs. First of all, these chairs look nice from a distance, but once you sit down you feel like Alice in Wonderland who just drank the little bottle that shrunk her down to size. These chairs are absolutely uncomfortable and make you feel 10 times smaller than you are. They are also too low for the tables they are seated at, which makes eating or drinking anything really quite uncomfortable and you feel like you're sitting on the edge of the seat trying to reach up. I did ask to be moved, explaining that the chairs were uncomfortable. The server promptly moved us to a 'normal' table. I wish they would get rid of those chairs.

The food was delicious. My duck breast was perfectly cooked, and the veggies on the side were great. No complaints about the food. Really great restaurant overall. Would go back."}
{"text":"The server was friendly and knowledgeable and the ambiance warm & classy. But it wouldn't have even mattered if I were eating in a back alley for the AMAZING food! 

We had prosecco alongside our hot and creamy baked brie and fresh sourdough bread. The highlight was the steaks we ordered, cooked perfectly to our requested medium rare. My fiancee had the peppercorn sauce and I had chimichurri (I have no idea the spelling!) but what matters is that it was olive oil based with plenty of garlicky flavour, a perfect steak topping. To be honest, the steak was so good that I forget my side dishes!

To top it off, the absolute HANDS DOWN best carrot cake of all time for my dessert. It was so moist and great cream cheese frosting,  along with house made pistachio ice cream. So good that we went the next day and bought two slices for a take out treat. Seriously. 

Highly recommend this place (my mom raves about their lamb fyi). Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Redwater never disappoints. Service was awesome and the food was super. 
Filet Mignon with chimichuri sauce. 
Yummy and then some!"}
{"text":"The food is always consistently very good.  The same goes for the service; our waitress was excellent.  We had a party of 12.5 consisting of 4 kids and one upset baby. She managed to serve the children first and gave the adults theirs shortly after.  Nice play.

We had booked a bit late, so we were unable to reserve the private room - which is nice for large (loud) parties.  Had we done that, maybe we wouldn't have received the suggestion from another wait staff \"to move the baby elsewhere....\" hmmmm.  I thought I had not heard that correctly so I verified it with the waitress.  Not long after, we received an apology for the comment.  No harm done.  Will try to aim for the private room next time. 

Nice wine selection and the desserts are fantastic.  Will be going back next week for yet another celebration."}
{"text":"Redwater Rustic Grille is a restaurant that I don't really think about going to.  It's a chain and I like to stick to indie restaurants.  However, it fit nicely into the location where I needed to be so I decided to give it a try.  I like the room, and the ambiance though I wasn't thrilled with being given the very front & center table in the restaurant.  It's hard to carry on a convo when there are diners milling around your table incessantly as they enter & leave the restaurant.

The menu had many items that piqued my interest.  I decided to try the roasted salmon sandwich.  It was quite tasty though it left me with wicked heartburn after.  Not sure if it's me or the sandwich though.

My lunch companion ordered the burger, which they were out of, so he ordered the southwest chicken BLT.  

Overall the food was good, the service was good and the room was nice.  Not a \"wow\" experience but definitely an a-ok experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here this past Friday night, we had a 6 p.m. reservation. It was my first time there, my wife's third time. The restaurant itself is very nice inside, and has a huge wine \"cellar\" in the center. The service as well was pretty good. We shared a couple of the starters. Chicken cilantro tacos, and crab cakes. I was a little disappointed in the taco appetizers, as the chicken was dry. The mains we picked were first, I had was a feature surf and turf. Steak that came with a two ounce lobster tail, served on mashed potatoes and brocolini. My wife had some kind of a salad, with salmon. I asked her how it tasted, and she said it was very good. I have to say my meal was good as well. I like to add to my reviews that my wife and I don't drink alcohol. The total for the evening, without tip was around the $80.00 mark."}
{"text":"I dug this place. The had a nice room in the back to accommodate our group.
The steak was good, but I was distracted by the waiters wearing stethoscopes."}
{"text":"Saturday night, empty restaurant, 2 hours to receive our mediocre meal. Both waitress and manager vaguely apologized for a kitchen staff that was clearly unable to accomplish the most basic of duties. Bill was received with no acknowledgement of the poor service. Upon asking to speak to the manager (there was a small line up of other customers waiting to file their complaints) he offered standard lip service. Couldn't even buy the table a round of drinks.
Brutal.
On the way out we spoke with another customer who was leaving before his dessert had even arrived due to such awful service/food. 
Good luck Redwater its a competitive market."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for our lunch with no communication not even refilled water glasses.  When we asked where our food was the server sent the manager over who explained there was a group in front of us - no apologies not even for the bone in the tomato soup.  Even though my pasta dish was very good the lack of communication and overall feeling that we were not important left us lacking a desire to ever return."}
{"text":"Classy. Warm. Modern. 

All words that crossed my mind right when I stepped in.

The night didn't start off classy though. I was left standing at the front awkwardly eyeing staff for 5 minutes to seat me. I can't remember the last time I've never seen hostess or staff to greet patrons, especially at a high reputable place like RW. 

I was there for a company meeting, and RW has a nice private room at the back. We had amazing service. A lot of attention to detail. Servers were very respectful to us and of our time.

The bison burger didn't quite hit my meat craving. Too thick of a bun. My co-worker next to me had a delicious looking lamb shank. I'll think twice next time, especially when it's on the company's VISA.

Overall, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Very professional and friendly staff but the food quality is really bad. We tried this place a couple of times and we were dissappoited every single time."}
{"text":"Business trip to Calgary and wanted a local restaurant that offered local beef. They had  great service and wine selection. I had Tenderloin Steak and tossed salad. I would rank this higher than The KEG!"}
{"text":"I visited Calgary to speak at an internet marketing conference that was right across the street. So while there, I ate at the Redwater Rustic Grille 3 times. The first time, I had salmon. The second time, I had halibut. The third time, I had the filet mignon. All three were outstanding.

The service was excellent too. The wait staff recognized me on the second and third nights and made a point to come up and say hello. They checked in regularly but not too much and were quick to respond when I needed anything.

I thought the prices were a bit steep.  That's why I'm not giving it 5 stars.  In particular, the halibut on my second visit was the special and the waitress recommended it. The salmon the day before was $24 but when the bill came, I realized the halibut was $34 ($10 more). It's not a big deal but I wish she would've told me at the time she recommended it. Perhaps I should've asked. Anyway, as good as it was, I didn't think it was worth $34.

Overall, this place has a great ambiance, good food and nice service ... but be ready to pay for it."}
{"text":"These days, extremely rare to be swarmed by great service, and our service experience at the Red Water - University was a treat!  5 by 5 on service!

For a Friday night 630 reso, the place seemed quiet with maybe only 5 other tables seated at our arrival time.   Throughout the night the place filled up and not once did we feel neglected.   Our Server was attentful and at least 2 managers were by to see how everything was going.

I ordered the Ceasar to start, and my wife a glass of Riesling.   Ceasar was very well made and if I wasn't driving I would of had 2 more.   I ordered a shrimp appetizer that includes 5 tiger prawn, a cream cajun sauce (well balanced with my ceasar), served over foccacia.   It was too much bread given our mini loaf of bread arrived moments before.  

My main was the rotisserie chicken.   I chose to go with the cimichuri sauce and mac n cheese as my side.   The chicken was served over some asparagus.   Cimichuri is very liquidy, and would have been best served on the side, nit directly on the chicken where it ran right off onto the plate.  Unfortunately the amount of the sauce was too little for the 1/2 chicken served and proved overpowering for the asparagus which were now smothered.

My pet peve with chicken, especially marinaded chicken, is that sometimes the blood stains the bones and as you eat it you see red or pink by the bones.  Generally speaking, it's totally food safe and not actually blood anymore.   However,  I never have this issue when I cook chicken so it's a matter of the technique used by the kitchen.   Moral of the story: don't make me second guess whether the chicken is safe to eat or not.

My mac n cheese side was amazing with a slight chipolte pepper heat.

Overall I would say food was a 3 by 5."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week... I was very impressed all in all. The service, atmosphere and food were all of very high quality. Their wine selection is MASSIVE, and their scotch one is also very large as well. 
The food was very nice, steak cooked to perfection, my girlfriend's pasta were very tasty (a little to al dente to my taste and hers, however). The complimentary bread is awesome.
The meatball appetizer was my only disappointment; they were good, just not very much so. 6/10, simply did not prepare us for the amzing-ness that was to follow. The dessert was great, the three chocolate servings were excellent (especially the mousse-my God that was amazing).
The server was also very good and made us feel very comfortable and relaxed. The food was quick to come out as well.

Overall, a great establishment. I will now be recommending this place to everyone who asks me where to go out for a nice and affordable dinner."}
{"text":"This is a chain steakhouse.  Similar to Flemmings down in the U.S.A.

Generally speaking, the place is overpriced for what you get.  Steak selections are not extensive.  Quality is just ok.  Sides are pretty plain.  I would say its not as good as The Keg, which is right across the parking lot.  Wine list is very limited and overpriced.  Grocery store Barbara almost pushing $100."}
{"text":"Went here (not by choice) one night after dinning at the location by the University.  

Again, I think the value is not there.  The meal selections are not great.  The quality is OK.  But the pricing is nuts for what you get.  For the money spent here you can go to Ceasars."}
{"text":"Hmm too bad there's no half point here, because I think Redwater deserves 3.5 stars (not yet a 4 stars though).  I guess 3 stars for now it is.  

I organized a staggette party for my sister tonight.  It was definitely a great night.  Everyone had lots of fun.  The waiter service was okay.  He was not rude but at the same time not exactly friendly either.  Just O-K if you know what I mean?  He does seem a little bit nervous though, maybe a room full of 13 ladies makes him nervous?

The food is good.  I have only been to Redwater twice and both times I have ordered this appetizer - beef mini burger.  One order comes with 3 mini burgers.  They are the perfect size and they are delicious!  We also ordered their calamari.  I think I am on a mission to find the perfect calamari.  I don't know if I am too picky or what, it seems like either the calamari is too bland or too salty.  Yup, I found their calamari too salty but I must say, this one is one of the better ones I have tried.

I ordered a half size Chicken Pappardelle.  Let me tell ya, next time I will order a full size even though half size was a good portion for me....cuz the half size costs me $13 whereas the full size is $17 but the portion is obviously at least 2.5 times more than the half portion!  Yup I felt I got ripped off for sure.

One thing I really like about Redwater Rustic Grille is that they have private room(s).  It is great for parties and/or with a large group of people."}
{"text":"This year was the first year separated from my friends and family on my birthday so D and I wanted to go out for a nice dinner together.  He'd always wanted to try Redwater and the menu online looked decent so we thought we'd give it a try.

To start we had the Braised Squid.  Being from Vancouver I have had a lot of kalamari, but nothing like this.  It was chewy but not tough - it had a fresh texture to it and light flavour.  The toppings were very Mediterranean with lots of kalamatas, sundried tomatoes, and a light hint of citrus from the orange and lemon.  Definitely worth having again!

For dinner we shared part of a bottle of Ca'Momi Merlot which was lovely (half of it came home), great flavour and a hint of bite to go nicely with the steaks we'd ordered.

We each had the 8oz Tenderloin paired with the Calabrese Mac & Cheese and green beans.  His tenderloin got the Maple Ancho BBQ sauce, mine got the Chili Garlic Butter and it was delicious.  The meat was cooked to just the right medium rare, the beans were well seasoned, and I loved the sauce on mine.  He wasn't entirely sold on his but I think he was expecting something closer to a traditional bbq sauce.  The Mac & Cheese wasn't as large a portion size as we were expecting but they came in little cast-iron pans that kept the cheese hot and gooey through the meal, and the spices were a nice touch.

For dessert we split the cheesecake but had them add some of their spiced peaches along with the berry sauce.  The peaches were warm and the cheesecake was delightfully light and fresh.

All in all a great meal, we were very lucky it was a quiet night so we got exactly the environment we wanted for the evening."}
{"text":"Love this place and the atmosphere. My wife and I came here for our anniversary and the staff members went above and beyond our expectations. Complementary champagne and desert, ensured we were looked after throughout the evening and the food was simply amazing. My wife ordered the salmon while I ordered the ribeye steak. My steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection (medium rare) and it was delicious. My wife loved the salmon as well. 

We have been here 3 times now and have had great experiences every time. Great staff members and fantastic cooks! 
Thanks again Red water rustic grill for an amazing evening!"}
{"text":"This was my last dinner in Calgary with my family and it was one of the best meals. The view and decor of this place was beautiful. 

The service was top notch. They made accommodations for my Aunt with food restrictions. The kitchen was already informed about it when we made reservations and the information was passed onto the rest of the staff so we didn't have to go around in circles. Now that's great service!

I'm from San Francisco, so we know our sourdough bread BUT I have to say they did it a little better here. There I said it. I'm used to the sour in the bread, but they had a nice balance here. The bread was served warm with a nice crusty top that wasn't over baked where it tore the roof of your mouth. The herb butter that went with it was also delicious. The waitress was thoughtful enough to bring plain butter for my aunt without us even asking. 

I had the tenderloin with brandy green peppercorn sauce. The meat was cooked exactly the way I ordered it and was really tender. They didn't over sauce it, just enough to get a taste in each bite. The garlic mash was also good, would have liked it  more whipped, but that's just my personal preference.

All in all, this was a great way to end my trip. Great food, great service, great view and amazing company."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was awesome. They have gluten free pasta and are willing to make any substitution to accommodate (in my case) a son with a gluten free diet."}
{"text":"We went in here for dinner, excited to try the chain, our expectations up very high from all the positive reviews.
We were set up at the bar until seating became free in the lounge as it was going to be 90 min to be seated. The bar is this tiny strip of quartz where having a drink is not so comfortable. You are in the zone where the waitresses converge, waiting for their tables` drink orders.
A glass of red wine at $9 appears to measure about 3 oz in the glass. It was 5 sips worth and then gone.  Good though, I had asked for a Malbec.
The menu looked interesting - but very overpriced.
Ordered: crab cakes to start as a shared appy - $13. Tiny morsels (2) dressed in thousand island dressing with tiny can-like crab flakes and hunks of potato that should have been crab. I had asked not only our server what was good at Redwater before we dove into our menus. Needless to say I was let down by this suggestion.
My husband ordered the steak which upon asking staff was told that it was quite comparable to the Keg in how they prepare it and present it. Wrong. The steak looked awful on top of mashed potatoes (those were good at least) surrounded by a few beets slices. No pizazz, no colour. Not worth $26 and that was for the smallest 8oz! We were so hungry so we did eat our food but our server could see we were not impressed. We had asked for more bread - that was also good, served with a pomegranate butter that gave the bread some good tang.
I had asked for a pasta substitution which would have cost me another $7 - no. I just ordered the mussels, again recommended and they were just - OK. Very bland in a tomato sauce but not as bland as the poor steak sitting across from me. We had to pour some of my mussel juice on top of the steak to give it a bit of flavour. You are able to choose a topping for your \"naked\" steak and my guy chose the garlic poblano butter which did absolutely nothing for the meat. To be fair, the cut of meat was good but the grill surely was not hot enough when the meat was put on as none of the steak had any kind of colour to it, limp, no char. 
A manager had come to our table after some time and asked if everything was good and we answered that it was just OK. She prompted us for comment and we politely told her our issues with the food, giving some positives as well such as - our server was nice and the restaurant itself was beautiful. She thanked us for feedback and that she would talk to the chef. She asked to buy us dessert but we just settled on a coffee each. It was not enough to make up for what we had to pay for.
Not sure we will return, never to this location anyways on Uxbridge. Maybe the one on Macleod is better... ?"}
{"text":"It was one of my favourite streak house, but today when I bit my rib-eye, it tasted sour, then they changed me new one, not sour anymore but still not  fresh. That makes me so disappointed , think will not come again."}
{"text":"Yesterday we dined here for the second time. Our reservation was for 7:30. The food was good quality but the experience was poor. They were out of 1) the Special. At 7:30?? 2) the veal and 3) mushrooms. Really? A steakhouse runs out of mushrooms at 7:30??  Very disappointing as it was our company Christmas celebration."}
{"text":"Super good food and the service there has always been excellent! We don't get to go there often but I know that when we do the pasta or tenderloin,  or really whatever we order will be good.  It can definitely be expensive, but it's pretty much worth it!!"}
{"text":"It seems this chain has gone downhill. Not sure if it is the bad Alberta economy or reason. 4 of us went for dinner Friday night. We were greeted with our server informing us they were out of 2 entres, salmon and veal parm. Both items that we would have liked to eat. 
My wife had Sable fish instead, & it was a very small portion & it tasted ok. I went with the surf & turf. The steak was very good but the description on the menu indicated steak & prawns. These certainly not what I think when I hear prawns, but instead 4 very small shrimp. 
Service was fine, not great, and food was average at best. 
When I am paying that much for dinner, I expected better than average, & don't know how you can not have 2 of your entres on th the menu. 
Better restaurants in Calgary for your money than this."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Redwater for my wife and had grandma come by to watch the kids. Date night!

We were eating early (5:00), because bedtime with two kids under 3 years old can be tricky.

When we arrived at the restaurant we were told by the hostess that we could only stay for two ours, because they are 'pretty full with reservations' - This after she CONFIRMED our reservation.

Message #1 received: Despite my having a reservation, it is not as important as someone else's who isn't even in the area yet.

I should also note that there was another couple ahead of us that were a walk-up, and I didn't hear the same \"greeting\"  spit at them.

Anyway, I decided to let it go and try to enjoy the evening. With a nearly empty restaurant we were seated in arguably the worst table in the place.

Message #2 received: Our comfort is of zero significance.

After stewing about it for a little while and trying to figure out what the heck was going on, we decided it was best to take our money elsewhere.

When the waitress looked over at us I explained why we were leaving to which she replied \"well, we are very busy with reservations.\" 

When I said that I had made a reservation the day before, she was a little taken aback. Regardless, it was time to leave."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going at this place, but for $40+ entrees, you sort of expect a bit of a departure from the norm. What I mean by this is, the management should be asking families to remove themselves when their children are acting up in the restaurant. Honestly, there were kids running around and screaming. This is something I expect from Jack Astors or Kelseys or the such. It was beyond annoying (to everyone in there).

My 8oz striploin was overdone, but the sides were pretty good (had broccolini and mushrooms).

Normally I don't worry too much about the atmosphere. But with prices as steep as they were, the place felt like a low budget family diner."}
{"text":"This year we decided to take our vacation in Canada. We first went to Vancouver and stayed at the L'Hermitage while touring the city. We found everyone to be kind, polite and helpful. Today while in Calgary we by chance stopped at the Redwater Rustic Grille. 
It was around 11:30am when we entered the restaurant and noticed it was 3/4 empty. We were met by a young kid in a tie. He gave us the once over then asked if we had reservations. We said no and his reply was a totally rude, snobby and stuck up \"We only have space available in the lounge at the moment.\" His attitude was enough for my husband and I to decline and leave. We were dressed appropriately. We were polite when we inquired about eating there. There was absolutely no reason for us to be treated so rudely. 
We were enjoying our vacation until that moment. We had nothing but kind things to say about Canada and it's people. We will not be returning to Calgary ever. It only takes one bad experience to ruin everything and I really resent some snot nosed kid being allowed or trained to be such an ass.
We co-own businesses and I would be horrified to have anyone who worked for us to behave like that to a customer."}
{"text":"One of my fave go to restuarants! They have a delcious menu, which does get changed now and then, and they will cater to the seasons. They always make a new flavor of butter, and they have GF bread, which I appreciate. 

The staff is always friendly, knowledgeable and make sure you are enjoying your experience. Being a celiac, I asked our server which sauces, sides and plates were GF. He wasn't certain on a couple of the items, so he went to ask the chef to be certain, which again I appreciate. I had the 6oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and brocolini. As always, it was a good meal, everyone enjoyed theirs. 

Being that we were there for a birthday, they gave my mom a special chocolate tart, and we all had some dessert wine. 

It's a great staple resturant and I prefer it to the Keg."}
{"text":"How can a restaurant not get it?  It is a very simple formula...good service...good food...make money.  They failed...miserably!
My husband wanted to go and take a friend of ours for dinner...I wasn't sure about the choice...but everything is worth a second shot.
Short story...waited 25 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. Finally got a drink...and waiter spilled wine all over table.  Had to ask for a cloth to clean up( this is 10 minutes later...when I was expecting this to be a no brain situation) ....because glasses were dripping off the bottom...
Food was ok...but marginal. 
I sat and watched other tables getting anxious on equally bad service.  How bad can it be...when I can just waiting for what table will blow their top first? 
Really folks...go the to the USA and get some tips on customer service. Money is tight in Calgary right now...and anyone heading out for dinner probably does not have an expense account.  
We asked for a manager...no one showed up....don't expect us back...and trust me... I will be sure to use social media to make you realize your stupid, elementary mistakes.   

URGGGG......How can you not get it?"}
{"text":"Was excited to go, but short staff made experience not so good. Waiter was friendly which was the good part. They ran out of what some of the group wanted to order and food was not up to par."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a celebratory dinner and we were both very pleased. He ordered steak rare and it actually came that way and I had a tuna steak. The food was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and hot, even though it was a packed house. Desert was also excellent. I would recommend the Creme Brule, it was the best I've had in Calgary. The drinks are nice and they have a wonderful wine selection. I was also impressed with the serving staff, professional, prompt and good natured. I rarely leave a restaurant completely satisfied, but this was a happy exception."}
{"text":"I had the Cobb salad that was seriously undervalued.  So small, too much dressing and mostly just lettuce, cheap on toppings that usually come with the salad that make it a meal. I left hungry. Service was meh, no water refills. The glass of wine I had on their recommendation was like vinegar."}
{"text":"Place was great.  I had the stuffed mushrooms and salmon, for lunch, and the food was fantastic.  The service was quick, would definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.. great decor/interior.. It's a little pricey but i think it's well worth it. Quality of the food is great and portions are just right. They're not too small and not too large. I ordered the Ahi Tuna and I was a little skeptical at first being that I was in Calgary, Alberta.. but it tasted great! 

we ordered crab cakes, brie cheese and spinach salad, as an appetizer, and meals included the ahi tuna, the sirloin, duck breast and the marlin (fish special). There were no complaints about either meals!"}
{"text":"My wife and I consider this restaurant the best restaurant in Calgary.  The prices aren't extremely expensive, nor are they cheap, however the entire experience at Redwater was flawless!.

I have and would recommend ANYONE who is looking for an EXCELLENT evening.   The service is 10/10, the decore and environment is 10/10 and the food is 10/10!.   10/10 is pretty good, and not only that, but it is consistently 10/10.

We love it there so much that we had our wedding dinner there, and our entire group said that the experience was perfect.  The servers are excellent, on time, polite, and know their products.  

TRUST me when I say that you should be going to this restaurant.   

I have only eaten dinner on the MacLeod Trail location."}
{"text":"Ordered a 6 oz Tenderloin, and it was delicious. I asked for rare and it's cooked perfectly. Corkage fee is $25 but I rather I have own wine. Nice atmosphere, service was great."}
{"text":"I've only been in Canada for a week and it seems that most restaurants are quite expensive, but it was nice to see that this place had some decent lunch choices that were under $20.

I forgot the name of my dish but it was some type of pasta with a cream sauce. It was quite good and the service was good as well. The waitress spilled water over our table but I admit it was a freak accident as the cup of the water snapped off out of the blue when she tried to hold the base. 

The manager did give us a 20% off discount for the mishap anyways which was nice. Overall great establishment with some pretty good food, I would have given it the coveted five stars if it wasn't as expensive...I mean it is lunch after all."}
{"text":"Great location but overpriced food for what they are offering.  One good news is consistency of food. Good ambience is another reason for my pick."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find!!  We went here by accident. Did you ever hear of a fantastic accident,  well, this is my first one!! No insurance claims necessary! :-) 

Great staff, highly efficient - polite. 
They will give their opinion when asked,  about what is amazing to order that night, I have adored every suggestion. 
Their food is always delicious. Some restaurants are a hit or miss, 
this one is super consistent, I (we) love predictable, when its about restaurants and food.  
It was, and  has been every single time, mouth watering delicious!!


Great place, a pretty place, delicious meals and fabulous staff!!

Our new, go to - restaurant!!!

Enjoy everyone!!"}
{"text":"Thiis place has gone down hill fast. The food is nothing short of disgusting. It used to ne amazing. I will no longer take people there. Very disappointing to ne served a bowl of grease by soneone who smells like a cigarette
Twice in one week the food came out disgusting. Im never going back. I have taken my clients here for over five years. Never again."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking.  Why go out on Valentine's Day when you can have a quiet, unhurried dinner at home? Sad to say, our beloved kitchen is a construction zone, so here I am with my hubby on Valentine's Day.  Why not go to one of our favourite restaurants in the Northwest? Sure enough, despite the fact that all of the tables were booked for the evening(it's always a good idea to make a reservation on OpenTable), Redwater delivered excellent food and top notch service. 
Our server was friendly and attentive throughout the entire evening.
I started out with a complimentary sparkling wine topped with a half a strawberry.  Hubby and I chose the Valentine's Special set menu at $65.95 per person (drinks not included).

Wild mushroom velouté en croute: a nice, earthy, creamy soup with a light, flaky puff pastry crust.  I wished that they'd had served it in a larger crock bowl (like what they use for French onion soup).

Spring artisan lettuce salad, sweet Merlot poached pear, champagne lemon emulsion and sunflower seeds: my poached pear was perfect--it was soft but still firm with a hint of the Merlot.  The tartness of the lemon and sweetness of the champagne just brought this dish up to another level!

Coffee and peach pork belly with pear gastrique, arugula and strawberries: I tasted my hubby's dish and went to heaven. What an incredibly clever combination of flavours!
The pork belly was so juicy and tender; the flavours of coffee and peach were subtle without being overpowering. 

Veal osso buco, thyme mashed potatoes, local vegetables and rosemary demi glaze:
this dish was utterly amazing.  The veal shank was tender and perfectly seasoned.  The show-stopper was the rich, creamy marrow from the bone (some of which I combined with my mashed potatoes). I found the demi glaze a bit salty but most of the sauce was off to the side on my plate (instead of drenching the potatoes or the osso bucco).  I also thought the tender crisp carrots looked a little lonely; some baby beets would have been good. 

Chocolate dipped strawberry sorbetto with roasted hazelnut: oh my... What a refreshing, light dessert to top off an excellent dinner!

Best of all, we didn't feel rushed at any time (it looked like our table was booked for the entire evening)--we must have been there for at least two and a half hours."}
{"text":"worst restaurant i've ever been to.  All other chains, including mcdonalds are thousands of steps above.  All the reviews on this restaurant must be rigged, or paid shills.  They all seem to be going for 20$ bottles of booze, maybe they are too drunk to know what they are eating.   

I went there for dinner for two, we had the steak and tuna.   The steak came out like a brick, smothered in sauce.  The tuna came out like a rare bulb, barley cooked.   I'd never eat here again, when we looked around only 80 year olds were dining.  This restaurant is the geriatrics cafeteria.  I'd avaoid this chain like the plague, dont listen to the shills for redwater who are too drunk to know they are eating cardboard.  McDonalds is 1000x better than this.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, but to be honest I find it over priced. Service was decent and food was good, but nothing to write home about. Wait, I don't know when I've actually written home, but still. 

I may return, but would prefer to give other restaurants a shot."}
{"text":"The place is very comfortable and has a nice decor.
Staff are very attentive and make the visit very pleasant.
Food is good and much better than most of the other fare in their vicinity.
How expensive is it? I had a small soup, a flat bread which is really a small pizza and 3 glasses of Malbec and with tips it came to 60+ dollars.
I'd rev commend this place for a good business lunch"}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner, although we kept it fairly light due to a long day traveling.  We agreed that the mushroom risotto with garlic shrimp was the best. The tomato-corn chowder was flavorful, but was served luke warm.  Would've been better if a little hotter.  The salad with scallops was very good, with large, nicely cooked scallops that had a lot of flavor.  The spicy chicken parpardelle noodle entrée was enjoyable and large.  For dessert we shared a lemon bar with raspberries. Delicious.  A very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"DOWNGRADE 3.5 STARS. Something has changed since the glory days of this restaurant a few years ago. This is a good restaurant but the pricing does not match the service and food. I wish I had walked over to the Keg across the parking lot. Does anyone smile at The Redwater Rustic Grille Uxbridge Drive location? Maybe it was just an off night? Who knows. I'll be going somewhere else to take my friends. Sorry."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. The downtown location of the famous Redwater Rustic Grille doesn't live up to the Northwest (cozier with personalized service) and Macleod Trail (classy and refined dining) locations. The design, ambiance and service is better elsewhere. The downtown location wants to be all things to most people - part sports bar, part after work watering hole, part night spot for a few young people and part sophisticated dining. This might work from a business point of view. However, to discerning eyes and ears, this place works hard to pull it together but, alas, one is left wondering what the Redwater Grille - downtown location - wants to grow up to be. To be fair, the food is still very good and worth noting here. Past that, for the dollar and the dining experience, there is better elsewhere. The service is not overly special and when they get busy, the food quality suffers. Drive to the other locations - worth the time and effort. Expen$$ive."}
{"text":"A - List. Highly Recommended. This is the only restaurant group to receive a five star rating . The food, wine, service and ambiance is first-class and world class. They use only the finest ingredients, expertly prepared. The interior is clean, modern, visually appealing and very comfortable. Seating is varied and plush. The lighting and background music are superb. The staff is intelligent, efficient and well trained. The service is on the mark. There appears to be ample parking. They seem to have thought of everything. Bravo! You get what you pay for. Expen$$$ive."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's never been crazy busy and I find it to be a bit of older clientele. They do a good steak and have a pretty decent wine list. The side Mac and cheese is a little runny and the gluten free pizza crust is so tough, don't even bother. But the meatballs rock. It's a nice place for date night, cute little tables in corners or big group tables as well. Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic!  Food was pretty good. I had the flatbread and liked it. My gal had the shrimp and scallops but the scallops were plain and had no taste. She didn't finish them. 
The best part is the atmosphere and the service. Probably the best server I have ever had. 
We'll be back but we'll order something else next time."}
{"text":"Nobody puts baby in the corner! And that's where they sat us, in a little 2-top next to the back corner wall. Meh. 

I thought the idea of having two servers was ingenious, until I realised that it meant we only had divided attention at best, and the main server was a bit abrupt. Our plates were blazing hot when the food finally arrived. Not sure if that was intentional, or again, due to the inattentive service. Love the free-pour glass of wine (but wouldn't mind a little more!). 

The meal was fantastic. I had a sirloin with buttermilk mash. My Aussie bf had lamb (but of course!) Loved the decor. The lounge looked way more my style, and will try that next."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Redwater Grille (McLeod Trail Location) when we went for a birthday dinner.

I found the atmosphere to be very cozy and comfortable. They had a great decor. Even for a Wednesday evening they seemed decently busy.

Our server was fantastic, I wish I got her name, she was very personable and friendly which is something I often find lacking when I go out to eat in Calgary. Often I find slightly pretentious servers who make me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. This was not at all the case wt Redwater she joked with us, made menu suggestions, and added to the welcoming environment of the restaurant. 

For dinner we shared the shrimp appetizer and I had the Salmon while my BF had a steak. We had both with the chimichurri sauce which was recommended by our server. My salmon was done perfectly and went really well with the chimichurri which isn't something I would have picked on my own. My BF said he steak almost melted in his mouth and was done to perfect. 

We were to full for dessert but I am sure it would have been just as good. Overall I would definitely recommend coming here for dinner as I left very impressed."}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase and explain why this Redwater is one of my favorites. From my most recent OpenTable review: had a bowl of the mushroom and barley cream soup to start this time - very rich and flavourful (loved the thyme). My entree was the pan seared scallop and warm spinach salad - delicious as usual, and pleasantly filling. Service was attentive and upbeat. Always a pleasure to dine here.

Update from 25 Oct 2010: Dinner - our son started with the roast corn and tomato soup, we had the ahi tuna carpaccio. For mains, our son had the bison meatball spaghetti, I had the duck breast, my wife had the oven fired salmon. For dessert, our son had the almond creme brulee, my wife and I shared the cheesecake. Pairing: Paul Zinck Gewurztraminer 2008, which has a strong hint of lychee in the top notes, as this varietal should. All good."}
{"text":"Red Water Grille is a great place to get a great lunch or dinner. They use top quality, local ingredients that shows through in their food. Try the reuben for lunch or the tenderloin or salmon for dinner. Yummy! Also, the wine list is one of the better ones in the city."}
{"text":"Had a reservation and was sat by a smiling hostess right away. Ordered a drink a looked at the menu for 10-20 minutes. Let Craig our waiter know we were going to camp and he welcomed us to stay as long as we wanted. We had the stuffed mushroom appetizer and the chicken tacos. Both delicious. Had a few more drinks then ordered a sirloin and a surf n turf. Both the steaks had a few chewy/sinew parts but all in all delicious. Carrots and beets were yummy. Had the feature wine with dinner and we were ready to go. Thanks Craig for a great night! Would've been 5 stars if the steaks were perfect but oh well."}
{"text":"Redwater Rustic Grille came highly recommended by a former colleague.  So our first anniversary following that conversation, I decided on Redwater for our celebration.

The decor of Redwater is fantastic.  The best word to define it is already in the name, rustic.  From first arriving, to sitting down, to enjoying the meal, and leaving, Redwater has a feeling of tradition that is thoroughly enjoyable.

The service was excellent, which is always one of the most important points for me in enjoying a restaurant, especially one that is of the higher class variety.  The food was fantastic and really made the evening complete.  I hope to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Dinner with a great friend which was special with fantastic fool. We will definitely be back. Well done guys"}
{"text":"Gave this restaurant a chance to respond before writing this but they don't seem to value client  opinions.  Stay away, don't waste your money.  Boils down to the fact that this is basically a blah, run of the mill, food factory with NO customer service or attention to details.  Very disappointed by the dinner they did for my daughters birthday.  Server and manager could care less- we were just another number to them.  Both food and drinks were extremely slow, and food was sub par at best.  Find a place with a personal touch!!"}
{"text":"I came to Redwater recently for a Christmas party, and might I just say I love it. That is, barring my almost death when my boot slipped from under my feet on the slippery bathroom stones. Bottom line is winter, snow and stone make for potentially dangerous situations.

Fortunately the rest of the floors had a bit more traction. I loved the lighting and decor of Redwater - it was intimate but avant garde. The party had wine and delicious appetizers that all seemed to be a spin on more traditional Canadian dishes. We ate well, the service was impeccable and I was very impressed. Everyone had a great time at the cocktail party all thanks to these guys."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough positive about Redwater Rustic Grille.  Amazing service, fantastic food.  Our party of 12 had to be in and out of the restaurant in 90 minutes on a busy Saturday night.  They accomodated us without making us feel rushed.  Every person in our party was raving about their food.  I felt like a hero for simply suggesting the restaurant."}
{"text":"Five of us made reservations for Friday night at 5:45 pm. Upon arrival I waited at the front reception area with bartenders, and wait staff passing by without asking if I had been helped. Ten minutes later, wait staff came by to seat me with my group. At this point the restaurant was not busy. 

We had ordered our meals by 6:15pm and by 7:50pm our meals has not arrived. The manager upon request came by and insincerely apologized for the late meal and began to explain that it was because one of our group members had ordered a well done 7oz steak...I'm sorry but this excuse wouldn't even fly in well acclaimed steak houses.

Our meals arrived approximately 15 minutes later but several were cold or luke warm. 

To their defence and in compensation,  they did bring in a salad, offered to replace cold items and in the end when we asked for a bill adjustment and they could tell we were not pleased- covered our entire meal. We dared order dessert what in itself was probably a mistake as that too took a lifespan to arrive and an order was missed and needed to be fixed again.

We recognize that restaurants get busy and short staffed, but leaving the restaurant 4 1/2 hours later when the reservation was placed before rush hour is absolutely unacceptable. Despite the restaurant compensation, I do not feel they were sincere in their approach and are obviously very new at this.

I frequently dine at all of the other Redwater locations in Calgary and have experienced only exceptional service. Returning to the Aspen location will never be considered."}
{"text":"Terrible.
Service was SO SLOW and by slow I mean drinks were ordered then appetizers and then main courses... Appetizers came out and were cleared BEFORE drinks ever arrived. After which we waited and waited and WAITED for our meals which did not seem to have been ordered at all until our waters were empty we flagged down the waitress to get more water. At which time she said they must be plating them.

Mine was cold - veggies were warm but my medium steak was well done with some rubbery shrimp and a scallop on top.

Apologies for taking so long seemed insincere. I didn't dare send the food back in fear of having to wait longer."}
{"text":"Over an hour we waited for our pasta dishes, mine came out so overcooked (soggy pasta, tough rubbery chicken), and bland, and ick but i wasn't about to send it back and wait another hour while the family ate theirs.
No apologies for the wait times, and the restaurant was not packed.... not sure why the waits.
To be fair I like the other locations just fine... this one just seems to have stopped caring."}
{"text":"We saw the post on It's Date Night about $20 bottles of premium wine, and had to go check it out there were about 6 to choose from so we found a red to pair with appetizers. It was fantastic. We shared the soup, scallops (my favorite), stuffed mushrooms (MR's favourite) and beet salad. Everything was great, so fresh and tasty, I LOVED the scallops and vanilla puree underneath them.
 The fresh, still warm, in house baked sour dough bread was so good MR could have eaten ten loaves! 

Service was great! She was very attentive, very friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant itself had a nice quiet ambiance."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary!! We had our mini wedding reception dinner here with 18 of our closest friends and family. They always provide us great service and the food is great!!

i recently took a client and co-worker there for a late lunch. Once again, I was extremely pleased with the service. I will keep coming back again and again! :)"}
{"text":"The prices are way to high for the quality of food and you have 3 cooking methods boiling hot, hot outside/cold inside or way under cooked.  If it wasn't for microwaves, then Redwater Rustic Grille would be out of business.  If you are going to work in the service industry, then take a culinary course.

The sad thing, the waitress' know they have a bad food, you can see it in their face when you complain about it.   At least try to look like you care about the customer."}
{"text":"I love the location and the view on the lake.
the fact that you can easily fit large groups for a brunch on the balcony is worth 5stars, but the quality of the brunch itself would get 2stars at most.

The staff are professional and very friendly and helpful, but the egg benedicts and especially the toasts were disappointing.

I would still go back here though :-)"}
{"text":"They were very busy when I went for lunch but I was seated promptly and got great service despite lots of large groups - this says a lot about their training and customer service level.

Kale Cesar was impressive - very delicious and fresh.  Don't fear the kale - they use a baby kale so it's not tough.

I had the steak sandwich as an entree.  It was an open faced sandwich which was a surprise but it was pretty tasty.  Not the tenderest steak I've had (even for a sirloin) but it was a good value nonetheless.  They also have a great wine menu and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch while working downtown today. They had two seats available at the bar and we were served relatively quickly. I ordered the salmon and my girlfriend ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, both were delicious!! I also had a cocktail and our bill came out to just under $40. I noticed they cater to gluten allergies as well, which is always a plus. We were in and out in less than an hour. Awesome lunch spot in busy downtown Calgary - I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went there twice so far and both times excellent service and delicious food!  Will definetly go again any chance I get!"}
{"text":"Ah, where to start.. 

Our first real date out since having our little girl (4.5 months old now) and we were super excited to be heading to Redwater with gift card in hand. A near-free evening of wining and dining and enjoying what we heard was a great food experience! If only you could see the disappointment in our faces as we left the restaurant. 

To begin with, a reservation was made via Open Table for two people for 6:30 pm on a Friday night. Brilliant, right? Well, after dropping my wife off and finding a parking spot, I was surprised and dumbfounded to find her sitting at a 19th Century stage-coach-sized table for four complete with captains chairs that, honestly, made me, a 6 foot tall guy, feel like a Lilliputian.

So, the next time our server stopped by I told her I wasn't too keen on sitting at the four-person table and if there was a table for two available, we would greatly appreciate it. That didn't go over very well. Apparently, a customer's request for a different table, a table more suited to the actual number of people in the party, is grossly overstepping the boundaries of the server's willingness to make a customer feel welcome. \"You want a different table\"? she asks with a furrowed brow. \"I'll have to go see.\"

Just as she turned to walk away I exclaimed that \"it's only if there's another table available\" and that \"in the mean time, I'd like to order our drinks.\" Her response was, \"well there's no point in getting your drinks if you're just going to move tables.\" Right, well, I had a feeling we were in for a good night.

Next thing we know, a front house staff member shows up at our table. \"Is it you who wants a new table\"? she asks.

I had just started to explain again that \"only if there's another table available,\" when I was rudely cut off with a roll of the eyes and the response: \"just come with me.\"

Wow, at this point I'm starting to wonder whether I've been completely out of line, but remember that I too was once a server and this was why I was asking in the way that I was - with polite candor. But enough was said and our new table was perfect for us and we weren't going to let it ruin the evening. 

Our expectations of the food were relatively high. But let's face it, when one is paying $10 per glass of wine, $33 for a steak and $29 for a seafood medley, one would expect very good quality. 

If I may... 

The wine was free hand poured and barely touched the middle of the roundest part of the wine glass. Now I fully understand portion control, but for $10 per glass that thing better be at mid point or, better yet, just over. You can't tell me the 150% margin on each bottle is going to get sucked up by adding an extra ounce per glass. Poor form in my opinion.

My $33 New York sirloin was cooked perfectly, and it would have tasted perfectly had it not been dry, leathery and not the melt-in-your-mouth steak one usually gets for $33. The veggies were fine.

My wife's prawn and scallop medley was probably the best part of our evening. It was cooked perfectly, tasted great and portioned to the point of being satisfyingly full. All good here. Also great was our bison meatball appetizer.

Total bill by the way, with an appetizer, three glasses of wine, two entrees and a shared dessert, was $114.

The ultimate question is whether the experience we had at the Redwater will make us go back. That answer is easy. No. It's just not worth it. Especially since The Keg is right across the street."}
{"text":"Service was indifferent and mediocre.  My guest found a hair in her burger.  Pasta was OK but felt like I bit sand on one bite.  An hour later and I became violently ill (the ill only food poisoning could possibly cause). The fact I had not eaten anything that morning confirmed this must be the most filthy kitchen in Calgary.  Repeat...hell no. GLTA"}
{"text":"To be honest my expectations were really low going in as I've never had good food at any of the Redwater locations. This time didn't disappoint .. and by that I mean it was still awful.  On a good note the kale caesar salad was quite nice however my pasta was atrocious. I'm a vegetarian and asked that the chicken be left out and add more mushrooms/spinach (the other two ingredients in the dish).  There was maybe 4 mushroom, ZERO spinach and they added about the equivalent of 2 full raw zucchini's .. yuck
The other leaky part was that it was an hour and 15 minutes before our food came out once the order was placed by our table.  Oh ya and it was freezing cold so they had an old busted up heater to try to make the area warm. One problem- the heater was broken.  That will be the last time I give them \"another chance\""}
{"text":"We were brought here by Taste of Calgary, and I must say, we were glad that we went. The service was superb. Our host, our waitress and the manager came by to check on our evening.

We decided to go with the 3 course dinner. A salmon appetizer with pickled cucumber. Delicious!! Followed by pork tenderloin wrapped with prosciutto served on mushroom risotto. Amazing!! Dessert was chocolate lava cake with scoop of amaretto ice cream, that was fantastic as well. All this for 35!!! Epic!!

My only problem with the dining experience was that I didn't come here sooner."}
{"text":"Had the special which happened to be grilled Atlantic char, with herb butter and a quinoa dish. Bartender was great as was the food. 

They had an issue with the front door as wouldn't open although the hours of operation said open. They fixed the door.

Nice staff and customers.

{"text":"I've been to this Redwater Grille twice now, both with a large meetup group of around 10-15 people for lunch. So, keep in mind that we get a private room and don't wait at the front to be seated. I've never been here for dinner either.

Likes:
-Service staff for our room is always attentive. Knows how to fill drinks and serve food without disrupting conversation. Always willing to help, polite and perfectly balanced professional/approachable attitude.
-Love the food, actually! Their portions are great and I always leave full. I'm a big fan of their tomato & corn soup. Delish. Sandwich options are yummy and interesting.
-Great atmosphere and modern decor. Definitely a place I'd take a client.
-Food presentation is elegant

Dislikes:
-Not very memorable in general..I forget this place exists until the next meetup.
-Parking is really expensive if you are coming into downtown from elsewhere (not their fault, but has to do with location)

I gave them 4 stars because my dislikes are not deal-breakers by any means. I'll definitely be back some more for lunch."}
{"text":"Did we have a couple of issues with our meal? Yes. The appetizers (prawns and Asian pork ribs) were great. Cocktails and wine were excellent. The mains came out over-cooked....a tenderloin and a beef salad were tough and over-cooked. But I will always argue that the quality of a restaurant NEEDS to be based on how they handle 'issues'. Because 'issues' will always come up in a restaurant....whether it's a 5 star restaurant or not. These guys handled our concerns in a way that left us feeling comfortable (for complaining), and extremely satisfied. A re-fire, some prosecco, an apology from both the waiter and GM, and a free dessert....we were very well taken care of. We've been here lots, and we have never had an issue...so don't expect this experience.....BUT....if you do have any concerns, you'll be treated to an experience that I would refer to as 'top shelf'. We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Calgary to eat beef. And that means something in this beef crazy cattle and cowboy town! Great wine selection and reasonable for Calgary too. We have come here many times and they are consistent and top notch. Waiters also are cheerful and attentive. They also have a private room for groups and we have used that ."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Redwater Grill on Macleod Tr. For years but this location for some reason is probably the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at for the price. I've given it a couple of chances and the latest one was the nail in the coffin. Went for brunch with my family. Service was terrible, but the food was the worst. We ordered brunch for 4 and all of our meals came out about 10 miins apart so by the time me and the kids were done our omelettes, my wife's finally came out. The toast was burnt and our coffees never refilled. Too bad the new Diner next door was lined up. This place needs some serious help."}
{"text":"Parking is a joke. Stay for more than three hours and you have to pay in a run down strip mall. No parking meter near by"}
{"text":"I've been to Red water a few times and have had a couple of great meals there..however, today I tried the soup and salad combo and I must say I was rather disappointed. I am a very big fan of cheddar and broccoli soup, but this seemed a little lack luster. Definitely was not my favorite. I won't completely cross Redwater off my list and look forward to giving it another try."}
{"text":"I've been to Redwater a few times. I've always thought it was pretty good. I really want to give it four stars because overall I do think this is a 3.5 to 4 star restaurant. The food is great. The service is great. The reason I give it three stars this time is because when I went last all the courses we ordered were okay and only one was  fabulous.

Steak is a difficult thing. I've eaten steak at so many restaurants by so many chefs. And I think that you should take this review with a grain of salt because I've become considerably choosy and picky over the years.

We ordered the meatballs and shared chopped salad to start. They split the salad perfectly and each of us thought it was absolutely delicious. Then ate a ribeye with Mac n cheese and broccoli rabe. Dessert was great. The sparkling water was really good. Our server was the sweetest girl. She was very professional and positive. Absolutely no complaints there. The other staff also was great. I'm only giving it three stars because of the steak! The steak was okay.

The best steak I think I've had in the city was at Caesars Willow Park. The Mac & cheese here was so so as well. To the best mac & cheese I've had in the city so far was at Farm.

Now... What was the best dish at Redwater Grille? Surprisingly it was one of the best Cobb salads I've ever eaten. It was really really good. Many of you will disagree with me for comparing the cob salad to a Caesar salad, but I am basing my comparison solely on taste and freshness. I love both salads. So .. It rivaled the Caesar salad at Caesars and also rivaled the Caesar salad at Teatro, which I thought was magnificent.

Still, the ambience, service, and quality of food overall at Redwater Grille is good."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals I have had. The service was great, even our waitress who had to deal with a table of idiots kept her cool and remained smiling and friendly. The current chefs menu was to die for, had the bison short ribs accompanied with gnocchi, mushrooms, peas and pearl onion all sitting in the amazing drippings of the bison!! My boyfriend had the New York Strip-loin and he said hands down the best steak he's ever had!! Highly recommend it. New favorite restaurant and worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Slobber, slobber!  Redwater Rustic Grille fed me the best steak I've ever eaten!  It was such a juicy cut of meat and cooked to perfection.  They certainly lived up to their reputation as a great steakhouse.

The thing I loved about Redwater was the fact that I got to choose my sides, as well as the type of sauce used on my meat.  They had many sides to choose from including roasted mushrooms, mashed potatoes and a delectable risotto.  The sauces included chili garlic butter, passion fruit dressing, maple ancho bbq sauce, as well as a couple others. 

This restaurant really understood what I meant when I said I wanted my steak rare, and what my boyfriend meant when he said 'blue rare.'  Both of our steaks were just what we wanted; not over or undercooked.  The meals are a little pricey, but are definitely worth it because they are so delicious!  Remember, you pay for quality!

The service is attentive, but not badgering, and the staff are very knowledgeable about their menu items.  Redwater makes a nice date restaurant since it's quite formal and has excellent ambiance."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Great ambience, great wine selection, good service.  Menu reads well but the salads were under-dressed; soups were bland; and main dishes (we ordered chicken pappardelle) lacked flavor.  I think the concept was good, just needs a bit more oomph.  For the price you shouldn't have to add your own salt and pepper to the dish.  But it is a nice spot to meet with clients or friends.  Just don't expect to be blown away by the food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice and elegant. The lighting is dimmed and wine glasses and silverware is all organized neatly on the table. The waitress was extremely courteous even though we came about 20/30 minutes before they were about to close. We took FOREVER to decide what we wanted to order but all the waiters were still very helpful and nice.

We basically ordered every appetizer and a lot of steaks. Since we were new to this area we took recommendations from the hotel clerk and she definitley steered us in the right way! The food was delicious and it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend who loves the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant. Located in a suburban fancy strip mall the place has a real west coast lodge feel. This is enhanced by the landscaping and rock waterfall that sits back of the outdoor patio. The place is really beautifully designed and thought out with a selection of tables in a lounge, dining room, patio or bar. The tables in the dining room include booths that all provide for an intimate and relaxed dining experience. The menu has a few unique options including soups, salads, sandwiches, steaks and sides. I opted for the tuna poke nachos while my friend had s chicken sandwich. The food was good and served promptly by quick, attentive and polite waiters but I hate when menu items do not include everything included in or on the dish. If you are going to be fancy listing ingredients, list them all."}
{"text":"We actually had a very lovely meal here tonight.  Visiting family that lives here in Calgary.  We had the ribs, surf&turf, and the salmon.  Everything was presented well and the tastes were very delightful.  The service from our server Amanda really added to our evening.  She was very friendly and helpful.  We would return time and time again.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Fort Mac, stumbled across this place because it is next to Cork liquor store ( amazing) in the Bow Valley Square. 

Ordered lobster tacos (meh) and red pepper dip (mmmmm) meatball were okay also. Wine bottles are half off!!! They renovating tomorrow so lucky us. Service was great even though our party turned from 2 to 6 people."}
{"text":"Redwater on Macleod is a fantastic place to go for dinner. Both the service and food are great! It can get a little noisy though so that would be the only downside.

I would recommend the Sirloin & Shrimp with the Chili Garlic Butter sauce. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the redwater grille! We have had great servive each time we have gone (one time we had AMAZING service when it was a birthday with some free champagne and cake). The food is always top notch. I enjoy the shrimp appetizer (with chimichuri sauce) and have had the lamb and steak dinners. Meat is always cooked properly. Gluten free dining here is great as they have gluten free bread and many options on the menu. they are also willing to work with you to make a dish allergen/gluten free. Really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Redwater looks like a place with well established clientele - pricey, slightly snobbish, attempting to be more expensive than it really should be.

I was not impressed by service, missing my table while working with \"preferred\" clients. I'd expect same treatment for everyone, not excluding the drive-in customers.

Food quality was quite decent, real professionals in the kitchen - but hey, for the money, it was just about right. Nothing wrong with having things right - but isn't it nice to discover something way above average quality for way below average price?

Not the case with Redwater.

Solid, serious place - looking slightly better inside than outside. Could be a good \"plan B\" in case you want to eat something professionally prepared, and all your favourite places are packed up as you're trying to book too late."}
{"text":"Having gone to the location on MacLeod Trail and really enjoying it, I had expectations for the one up in the NW to be just as good.

It was quite busy, which isn't a problem, but there were kids screaming and playing hide and seek.   When you are paying a lot for an an entree, part of that comes with a certain dining experience.   If I'd wanted to hear children I'd have gone to a FAMILY restaurant and eaten there for a fraction of the cost.

Our waiter was overworked and very odd.  His first visit to our table, and he proposed waters, and didn't ask us for a drink order.  I was fully wanting to order an alcoholic drink but he didn't even give us the chance to ask.   With it being super busy, our water arrived quite a lot later, and then we had to ask for our drinks.. again he didn't ask us if we wanted appetizers.   I guess he couldn't multi-task..

After we got our alcohol we ordered, he did know the menu quite well.   My appetizer was the salad greens, which were very delicious. I ordered the salmon with broccolini and beets.  The vegetables were delicious, but my salmon was cooked just barely enough.   I'd prefer it to have some crispy outside, and not a majorly soggy inside.

Parking was also a nightmare, its a large complex, with not enough spaces.  We had to park in the Wendy's lot."}
