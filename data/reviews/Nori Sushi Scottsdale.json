{"text":"Some of the best sushi in phoenix! Mr. Lee, the sushi chef and owner, is a true artist with everything he creates. The atmosphere is really nice with really good music. The staff is very attentive and also have great recommendations if it's your first time. You can count on this place being consistently great every time you go there!"}
{"text":"100% the best sushi I have had in Arizona, and maybe even California too.

Ahi tuna done very well. Las Vegas-esque roll rolled in panko, check. Calamari, thanks much. Waffle dessert with vanilla ice cream, holy *#%^.

Proud girl from the bay, I know my fish baby.

Oh, and manager boy...hey ;)"}
{"text":"Ilona was awesome. Great recommendation on food and drink. Very friendly.  
Sushi and all food great.  Yes on the waffle dessert.  Must try.
Will return"}
{"text":"Honestly it takes forever to get your order, sat for nearly 30min and haven't received my rolls and it isn't even Packed, people after us got their food before us, bad service and the food is decent but not worth the wait, pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"Have had sushi numerous times but this was certainly my best experience. Food and Service. Cant wait to go back !!!!"}
{"text":"Service and quality of the food was exceptional as always!! Love walking over for happy hour"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi. Wonderful presentation. We come here once a month and the food is consistently good. Also check out the daily specials."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Our new favorite sushi restaurant! We had nigiri, delicious garlic chili edamame, and several rolls. The service was great-- thanks Mike! And the sushi chefs at the bar were talented and friendly. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"After being told how great this place was we decided we had to check it out. Hands down the best sushi we've had in awhile. Everything tasted extremely fresh & was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend the lobster tempura. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So, been here 3 or 4 times since my first visit and initial review. Place is still amazing. Food is always fresh and tastes amazing. Twice now we've had Lynnae, another manager, who is always great, very personable, and makes the entire experience more enjoyable. Between the food, service, and staff, this place has quickly become one of my favorite places to go to, lunch or dinner.

{"text":"Super friendly staff for lunch. My husband and I know good quality fish and we do have to say the quality at Nori was very good. We are pleased with the quality of three sushi restaurants so far, Shin Bay, Toyoma and Nori. Hope this place could lower their prices a bit. For lunch we spent $100 that's a lot!"}
{"text":"Nori seems to have it figured out.  Food is incredible with freshest of ingredients.  You feel like everything is made just for you.  Sashimi and sushi rolls that melt in your mouth.  We love to get the sashimi sampler platters. 

Service is always great and management  makes you feel they appreciate your business by acknowledging you as a valued customer.  

Atmosphere is casual, our teenage daughters enjoy going with us also.

Don't leave without having the green tea waffle with homemade green tea ice cream.  ENJOY :-)"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out so I was already anticipating a bit of quality loss. However, I was pleasantly surprised at just how great everything was! The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was absolutely delicious - everything seemed fresh and the favors were on point. Our entire experience was wonderful and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Craving Japanese style noodle soup since I was feeling poorly, found this place in the north reaches of scottsdale. 

Service was prompt; drink was a delicious non sweet green iced tea. Ordered tempura udon and a Philly role to try out sushi. Sushi is pretty basic but good, hard to screw up salmon cream cheese and cucumber. 

Star of show was udon; initially surprised by a smaller portion sizes served in small pot but it was perfect! There were not so many noodles that it made it hard to eat, and the vegetables were fresh as well. The broth was lighter, slightly oily and had a rich background of savory and heat. Noodles appeared to be home made to. They warned me it took 20 minutes to make but was in table in less than 10. God lunch spot if you work in the area, or looking for lighter fare in the summer"}
{"text":"I ordered Crispy Green Tea Waffle. It is really awesome. The waffle is all sinked in sweet green tea flavor, crispy and soft. I'm regretting I was so full before I came."}
{"text":"We saw a review in the paper and tried it out Saturday.  Excellent food.  Great service and atmosphere.  If you like sashimi no better place.  There seafood pancake was novel and absolutely delicious. Not cheap but what good sushi restaurant is."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying this place is clean, tidy and nicely lit, however upon receiving our orders which the quality of the food looked nice as this was for a party of 3, unfortunately we were extremely shocked at how stingy they are with the food portions! and it's not right for paying Top-Dollar prices yet getting a kids meal size portions! Now I've been to other Japanese Restaurants before and all of them had the same similar prices but with a whole lot more portions including extras such as side salads w/ dressing & miso soups, Here at nori is non existent! This may explain why this restaurant is never fully packed, considering for a Friday evening!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that I have been to Nori at Desert Ridge... not that impressed! 

This location however, was great. 

Friendly staff. Fresh sushi. Beautiful patio. Dog friendly. And minutes away from the hiking trail. And, open for Sunday lunch. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Ordered katsu chicken, it came with white rice and a side salad.  It was delicious!  Best rice, I've ever eaten.  They allowed my puppy outside on the patio, which was really awesome!  The location and the decor is fantastic.  You can see McDowell mountains!  The food came out in a decent amount of time.  Where they fell short was the waiter service and the price.  The waiter was not attentive, even though it was dead slow.  She failed to give me a napkin and I had to ask for soy sauce.  But, she was very nice.  I'm not sure that I will be back again for lunch, maybe dinner is a different experience."}
{"text":"I love sushi so trying new places is always fun for me. I tried almost everything on the menu because there were so many unique items. Honestly, there was not one thing wrong with anything I ordered. I highly recommend trying the seafood pankcake, Chilean sea bass, EVERY sushi roll & of course their green tea creme Brulee. Make sure to ask for Michael as your waiter. He was very friendly and entertaining throughout the whole dinner. I highly recommend this place for atmosphere, clean healthy food, and great service :) very accommodating if you are on a clean diet!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and frequent the Bell Road location pretty often (about 1-2 per month).  Usually, the experience is awesome.  And while this place would usually be deserving of 5 stars, I'm only giving it two because of my last two visits.  Both on Mondays and complete disappointment with the service. 

A few weeks ago, it took over 15 minutes for the server to get to our table.  Waters came 10 minutes later and for only half the table.  Ordering was nearly impossible and I was half-tempted to walk my sushi order to the sushi bar myself.  I walked over to a cart outside and helped myself to napkins and chopsticks for the table.

Tonight was a similar experience.  No server for a long time, and our appetizer came after our food.  No apologies, no \"let me take this back for you\", just matter of factly dropped it off, and it was cold too. (Supposed to be hot).  

So, what could be a five star place is really suffering on the waitstaff side of things - and it's not improving. I don't think I will be back. 

Disappointed."}
{"text":"Large selection menu.  Good service and overall a good North Scottsdale restaurant.

Good appetizer with a fantastic Sushi plate for sharing."}
{"text":"We are from LA and like to have sushi a couple times a month. While visiting Scottsdale for the first time we definitely wanted to try a local sushi place . We Yelped to find a close sushi restaurant and  we were drawn to Nori.  We were NOT disappointed. First off the asahi draft was ice cold and went well with the hot saki they serve. Not sure what kind it was but it had a nice clean taste....no bitterness whatsoever. We started with the chili garlic edamame and a roll that included jalepeno, yellowtail and tuna..... . My 15 year old gobbled those down so quick we were lucky to get any! The roll was frsh and flavorful.....in fact im craving it right now it was that good. Onto the main course. We shared a bowl of shrimp yakitori, and each had a calamari salad. The yakitori was flavored so well, not greasy at all and had plenty of large shrimp. The salad was AMAZING. Bits of candied nuts and strawberries with a light flavorful dressing and LOTS of calamari!  We usually get lots of hand rolls and nigiri when we go out to sushi...but tonight after the salad and noodles we decided to just share some spicy tuna and a Philly roll, while my son had spicy tuna and a Cali roll.  Once again we were delighted. Such great flavor. I like lemon and lots of sirachia but you really didn't need anything extra. The fish was fresh and flavorful......so yummy. Then my husband and son topped off their meal with the green tea waffle with vanilla ice cream. OMG you HAVE to have this if you go. So light and tasty.......very satisfying without being heavy......cannot wait till our next visit to come here again! Oh and Ilona, our waitress , was so attentive and nice. Thank you for a wonderful evening!!!!"}
{"text":"having lived in San Francisco for 19 years I was spoiled by the small restaurants with the freshest fish and Japanese chef who treated sushi as an art form to be enjoyed from many perspectives.

When I moved to Scottsdale/Phoenix in 2005 I was disappointed by the lack of any sushi restaurant that represented what I was used to in SF. They were all big, impersonal and I never had conversations about the food with the sushi chef as he was too busy cranking out standard California rolls. There was no art, no Japanese culture and basic fish.

I saw a review for Nori 5 weeks after it opened and it caught my eye. I was interested, but concerned it would be a repeat of the plain-Jane, boring sushi place that occupied the space previously.

So my wife (also tired of boring sushi factories) and I tried it one Sunday night.

BAM!! They had Japanese chefs, you could talk to and order from who looked to be creating edible art.

Our first bit of sushi and sashimi was served over a bed of ice with fresh wasabi and dicon. Really, fresh wasabi! The fish was cut in large tender pieces, as opposed to thin strips I see in other establishments. In another nice touch they have good Japanese beers on tap and their sauces (ponzu and the like) are made with fresh citrus juice and not bought from Sysco.

Nori impressed us a lot and reminded us of our really good places in SF.

We went a total of 4 times in 7 days for lunch or dinner our first week after discovering it."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and were the only patrons... This worried me a bit since I had not been to this place since it was Satori Sushi. We sat on the awesome patio.. Actually ordered something other than our usual rolls that we get everywhere. Seriously the freshest sushi I have ever had anywhere. If we still lived in the neighborhood we would probably eat here once a week at minimum. Our server was fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Ah, if you love sashimi like I do you'll never go to another sushi place again! They have a great variety of fish, from Toro to Snapper, always fresh, and the presentation is beautiful. Plus, and this is a real delight for me, REAL Wasabi! The restaurant itself is very pretty, with such a peaceful patio, complete with a waterfall and all. Also, I haven't seen anyone mention the playlist they have, which is fantastic. The staff is very knowledgeable and personable. It was recommended that I try the green tea waffle. I was skeptical at first,  but my goodness, it was to die for. Definitely the best sushi in town."}
{"text":"Excellent service and sushi!  Really enjoyed the visit."}
{"text":"Of course you can't rely on the people of Scottsdale on their yelp reviews, sad. Anyway, on to the my review. Ordered regular philly roll with miso soup. Both bland and something I wouldn't go back to - which, glad I didn't, looks like Nori Sushi has 4 food violations according to CBS 5 news.

{"text":"Worst sushi ever in my life!! Roten eggs !!! Never it Uni here!!!! Never go!!!! No stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.  I've been there twice, and both times the food and service were impressive.  First, let me say, I am not a great fan of Japanese cuisine.  Tempura and spicy tuna sushi are about as much as I can handle of Japanese food.  That being said, the Tempura and sushi at Nori were excellent.  We did order a chef's special sushi roll (everything was cooked) and it was delicious.  I adore the vegetable tempura...I think it's an appetizer...but it was just perfectly done and oh so good!  I love the ambiance of Nori.  Intimate, with a great bar, and no one rushes you...that is to say, both times the service has been excellent!  If you like a great atmosphere and Japanese food, I would think Nori would be a perfect choice."}
{"text":"This place is for sure the best sushi in Scottsdale, and we eat everywhere. The yellowtail was like butter everything has been great and never fishy. 
Even the little things are good like miso soup and sunonomo. The uni is great also. 
The best."}
{"text":"I am so glad my friend and I tried a new sushi restaurant because we were both so in love with this place. Our server Erin was awesome and she gave some great recommendations. We ordered the seafood pancake, spicy sashimi salad, and the grilled butter corn salmon. Everything was absolutely delicious!! I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been just craving some udon. Having visited Okinawa, I've come to really enjoy a good bowl of broth & noodles. My server seemed to come over in a reasonable amount of time to take my drink order and he returned in ample time to take my order, a bowl of udon & urchin nigiri sushi. And that's where it ends.... I waited quite a while for my urchin & it was about 45 minutes before my udon arrived. As it turns out, they got hit with a large party and the kitchen was overwhelmed. Sorry, you are in the business and you should be ready for a rush like that. So, as I waited, I saw my waiter only when he looked my way & could see the frustration on my face. I decided not to walk because the reviews on the food seemed pretty good. The manager apologized & graciously comped my meal, for which I am grateful. Besides, the udon should be pretty darn good. Well, I don't see me ordering udon over there again anytime soon. The broth was salty, very salty. Disappointing. The noodles were good, the soup was hot and the tempura was done well. But, salty broth & udon do not go well. Not sure about giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Our sashimi was awesome. And the ahi poke was fresh and on top of a cinnamon dusted cracker. We loved the tabiquail egg."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. The fish was very fresh and just melted like butter. The rice was just right. My husband had the hamachi collar bone and stopped speaking . His face was full of joy. Miso soup delicious as well. Not cheap but great quality"}
{"text":"I always like to support the businesses close to home and can honestly say the quality of the sush is outstanding! The last sushi joint that was in this exact location before was always dead and even though I supported it I knew in due time it would be closing. I have been to Nori twice in the last couple weeks and it is always filled with people."}
{"text":"I came here for sushi with a party of 10. We called ahead to make a reservation and they had the table ready right when we arrived. The service was very friendly and they kept our drinks full at all times. 

The sushi was really good, we ordered a variety of rolls and everyone was really satisfied with how they turned out. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi, great service.  Had to wait 30+ minutes for the sea food ramen so ended up canceling it. Wish the server let us know it takes this long to make because we were done with everything and had to sit there and just wait for a while.  We will be back to try the ramen but sushi was very good."}
{"text":"We just left after having lunch here.  Will was awesome!  He made the best drinks and the food was amazing!  Lunch prices can't be beat for this area and the quality.  We will be back soon for happy hour."}
{"text":"Good food for the right price. Kind a fast food sushi but with a good quality product. Needs more parking spaces expecially on weekends."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere. I'm sad Paul the bartender is no longer there. He was always such a good conversation piece. I hope his replacement steps up his game."}
{"text":"wow this place so deserves a 4.5 rating.  It is well designed and decorated and you can feel comfortable dressed either casual or well.  They give you a nice warm towel when you sit down which is a great touch. Service is exceptional (reception and table-side) and the ratio of staff to customer is perhaps the best i've seen in a reasonably priced restaurant.  

If you are looking for a place to take the lady I think most will love the vibe here and it will feel like \"a date night.\"  Though Nori is more or less a strip mall, once inside and you are in another world that feels contemporary, clean and rich.  Steady grooves of Thievery Corp and Nightmares on Wax sneak around all night at just the right volume.  Great lounge vibe.

Sake is served elegantly and correctly in a wooden box and mine had an integrated ice compartment to keep my sake cold.  Sweet!

The fish quality is very good.  They had bluefin toro a few of the nights I've been there and it was old school good.  They also seem to consistently have fresh Saba and fry the bones correctly afterwards.  Their presentation wows you every time and they have great plate ware and garnishes.  

All of the sashimi as very fresh and high qualify right up there with some of the best.

On the down side I would say that I typically enjoy talking to the sushi chef and interacting on and off throughout the night but there is not a lot to work with here.  They are a little indifferent and a little too serious.  If this was a language barrier than my bad but  I didn't detect that in our limited interaction.  They do certainly know sushi so this is a minor gripe.  

Kanpai"}
{"text":"Excellent. Some of the best sushi we've had in Scottsdale or Phoenix. 
The daily chef specials are especially good. 
We will try happy hour next."}
{"text":"\"Life is short, eat dessert FIRST\"

The wisdom of this slogan will become apparent as you read my review.

My partner and I visit Japan several times a year and are always looking to find sushi that compares to Tokyo. Up until now, we've struck out in Scottsdale.

Kudos to Nori. Finally a sushi restaurant that is on par with the freshest sushi we enjoy in Japan. It took a Korean chef to create the ultimate Japanese sushi restaurant. How BRILLIANT is that!

The service is another standout. I hope Jenny, our fabulous and attentive server, reads this. JENNY is probably THE BEST SERVER we've had the joy to meet here in Scottsdale. That's quite a compliment as we go out to eat at least 7 times a week, if not more, as we usually go out for lunch during the week and breakfast every weekend. That's a lot of servers that we get to meet. What impressed me most was that Jenny knew exactly when my beverage had to be refilled AND she brought a fresh, cold glass every time! It's the little things that make a difference. 

But I digress...lets talk about dessert. From the minute I glanced at the menu, I knew I had found the ultimate home away from home. As not only does Nori offer the finest & freshest sushi in town, it also offers homemade gelato. We had to pinch ourselves, as finding our two favorite foods under one roof is unbelievable!!!

If you don't order the green tea waffle with homemade gelato you'll be missing out big time. 

In conclusion: it doesn't get any better than this if you are eating sushi in the desert. We leave tomorrow for Tokyo, but it will be nice to have Nori to come home to.

PS) special thanks to Brett for his patience in directing me to Nori. I wouldn't have found it without him."}
{"text":"The sushi was great, not the best, but pretty great, but also pricey. Nice atmosphere though, will be back if I'm nearby. Oh, and their green tea waffle with ice cream is a blessing."}
{"text":"Should have known better. Went here with family since it was in the area and  got Food Poisoning 4 hrs after eating there."}
{"text":"We stopped by Nori, just a few miles from our house, and I expect we'll become regulars. But it's also worth a trip if you're not from the neighborhood.

There's been a dearth of good sushi in the immediate neighborhood for a long time, but Nori is among the better options we've tried in the Valley. The fish was fresh and flavorful, and didn't rely on gimmicks as seems to be the norm these days. Regular rolls are $7'ish and specialty rolls are roughly double that. But the specialty rolls seem to rely more on good fresh fish and other ingredients, rather than being slathered with heavy sauces. The crunchy roll, for example, had a unique and subtle flavor that made it a favorite, despite its relative minimalism. Another standout was the tempura, which is among the best we can recall. It was light and crisp, not doughy or greasy. Well played, Nori. 

Though we didn't try it this time, it was nice to see some noodle dishes and other Japanese staples, for those days when you want your food cooked."}
{"text":"I personally think this place was overrated and really expensive for the food quality"}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of any sushi restaurants in Scottsdale as they are all at best a hit or miss. Nori is the best Sushi restaurant in Scottsdale...hands down. 
After your done shopping at Kierland or Scottsdale Quarter....this place is worth the quick drive. 
Jared also delivered amazing service! 
Thank you NORI!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Udon Soup with tempura. Mmmmmn! And simple green tea, the waterfall and perfect setting on the side of the mountain make for a zen-ful meal.  I love the Udon soup with thick noodles and whole mushrooms for a grounding, cherish-able meal."}
{"text":"Okay, I thought this was going to be a 4 to 5 star experience after looking at the menu.  So it's Sunday nite and I ordered online to pick up a to go order.  

So..here is where the fun begins.  I waited 25 minutes after I ordered before I left, which was about a 10 minute drive.  35 minutes to prepare exactly---1 miso soup, 1 cucumber salad and 1 Ahi specialty roll.  That's it.  Arrived and was told \"they are getting it ready now\".  Sunday nite, only 4 tables in the entire restaurant, hostess was rolling silverware.  Not much going on it seemed.

10 minutes waiting at the bar, I ask \"ah where is my order\".  The response from the bartender was \"oh we were really backed up, but it's coming right up\".  Another 3 minutes later finally it came and the bartender was nice enough to say he included an complimentary edamame.  Normally a great thing but no one asked if I needed a water, or how about just letting me know someone screwed up and it took 15 minutes to make one roll.  Soup and cucumber salad was already made ahead of time.  No empathy and the apology was lack luster, like it had to be said.   So here you go, your apology!

Now let's get to the food-  The Miso Soup was good, but no chunks of tofu that I always love.  The cucumber salad had no seaweed or anything else but cucumber.  The cucumbers seemed like they were just cut and thrown into the vinegar compared to marinating to get the flavor. (as a side note, what is the shame in saying you ran out of something and don't want to half throw something together.  I would have totally understood).

The Ahi roll was good, almost bordering on really good but not quite.  The real kicker was that edamame that was complimentary- guess what?  No salt what so ever!!!

I hate to say this since I live in North Scottsdale, but what is the lack of customer service or caring that seems persistent in this city?  Nori has so much potential but the bartender who probably doesn't see what he does as a representation of himself, could care less.  The rest of the staff didn't have that much concern either that a customer's order wasn't even ready 35 minutes later but instead opted for a lame excuse instead of just saying \"hey we made a mistake\".  Lots of 5 star reviews for actually what is a bit above average sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi in the desert .... oh YA!!
We tried several rolls and types of Nigiri and were NOT disappointed by any of it!! A good Japanese beer and vanilla gelato as a finisher. Our host and waitress were attentive, informative, friendly and FABULOUS!!! We are visitors from Iowa and know we WILL be back next visit."}
{"text":"A sushi restaurant in a strip mall, we did not expect the combination of ambiance and food quality. Impressive both inside and at our outside table, we enjoyed the experience and value for money. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. I came in during bike week in Scottsdale and sat at the bar. The bartender Will (I believe was his name) was awesome and very knowledgeable of their menu as well as things going on in Scottsdale. I would have to say coming from a coastal city I didn't know what to expect from sushi in AZ but I have to admit, it was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted great until the food poisoning settled in later that night. After puking about 10 times I decided I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Sad to say I have to remove several stars from my original review. The food is still 5 star and so is the service.... well except for the head sushi chef. He alone drops the score. If I were only going by him I would have to give negative stars. Apparently his pride comes before what a customer wants. Very sad! They have interesting items on the menu but if you need to modify any ingredients for dietary reasons well you might as well have insulted his mother. Please Mr head sushi chef you need to understand good sushi bars in Scottsdale are a dime a dozen you must give the customers what they want, even if it doesn't match your grandmother's accent recipe."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was slow and confused. In fairness I think they had trainees that night so that's OK. Gnats on the patio were a major problem and have been before, so beware."}
{"text":"Super clean and good service. This place is a little neighborhood treasure. Food is always fresh and drinks are good. I eat here a lot."}
{"text":"Great service and food! A bit pricey but worth it. I hate noisy places with loud music and this was none of the above. I am looking forward to sitting outside when the weather cools down."}
{"text":"Have you ever considered finding the best sushi restaurant in the middle of dessert? I understand if you haven't, but I strongly suggest this one to be your first and last great experience of sushi in AZ. Especially, please have a seat in front of the head chef and follow his lead. He surely knows what he's doing and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They get 3 stars for the kindness of the staff.  The kitchen gets 1 star for being the slowest in town.  I also think the prices are a little high.   The green tea waffle is unbelievable.   Best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"This place continues to go down hill. I've been a regular for quite some time and the continual turnover of staff and lack of quality experience is less than enjoyable. Tonight was a night that was less than acceptable. While we were sat right away, we waited over an hour to receive our first roll. It took another 45 minutes for round 2. I should have waited the 30 minutes to be seated at The Vig."}
{"text":"Great casual date with fantastic sushi!
Always quality food and friendly service.
I find it more authentic than other places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. I love the staff and could eat here every day. I dont even like sushi but LOVE the food here and the bartender is the best mixologist in the valley....truly a hidden treasure....the place is packed on Friday and Saturday nites due to the great vibe so come early."}
{"text":"Best quality grade sushi I have had in Arizona. It's pricy but it's worth it. I'm a sushi addict and to finally find something that's great quality makes me so excited to have found this gem. The sakana trio, nori  and big eye rolls are to die for. For sure will be back"}
{"text":"If anyone knows me I typically don't show face in sushi joints.  I have texture issues with anything slimy, mushy or fishy smelling near my mouth or olfactory buds.  Joann and I were craving something new and exciting..and guess what Yelp just happens to have a Hot and New category to explore!  Yelp is always my go to, embarrassingly I admit even in my hometown of Phoenix.  I lived in North Scottsdale for a couple of years and it is still foreign to me when it comes to food, which is a cross I'll bear, there I said it!  

So, sushi...let's get to it.  I found Nori under the Hot and New category and wowzers we enjoyed ourselves!  It's a little hidden gem with a fabulously relaxing and quaint patio complete with bamboo stalks, water feature and breathtaking mountain views (I know, people don't know we are surrounded by mountains in the Valley).  Joann and I gussied up to the perfectly set sushi bar next to a Canadian family that was consuming mass amounts of the raw rolled stuff.  I am a connoisseur of just sitting in awe at the knife skills of these clearly talented sushi chefs.  I applaud those that can wield a sharp object like a surgeon without the anger management issues and produce artful masterpieces that I'm supposed to consume.  

The GM Brett talked to us the entire time we were there.  He was delightfully engaging, even spilling the ancient Japanese secret to their green tea waffles...nope, I'm not telling you, that's for me and me alone peeps!  He told us that there were 3 locations of Nori (Desert Ridge, Hollywood and this is the newest location).  He also told us that their green tea waffles were 'Valley renowned', that people would trek near and far for these palate pleasing mind blowing desserts.  

So after chitchatting for a bit are hunger pains took over and after perusing the menu, which was not overloaded with run of the mill crap, I decided on Golbi (Korean short ribs) and Joann did not disappoint with her choice of Chilean Sea Bass.  It's always a gamble at a new place to go hungry and expect to be satiated when you are done...this was definitely the case!   Presentation of our plates was spot on; from the pedestal of beautifully dark and savory forbidden rice that the Chilean Sea Bass was strutting itself on like a new pair of red soled Loubitans to my personal cast iron cauldron full of short ribs that saturated my palate with a dark and stormy sweetness that urged me to gobble them up.  Dessert...wow...Brett didn't lie.  If it were possible for me to have more kids (which are all Ginger's for those that don't know me well) I would name them Nori after the dessert experience we had.  I felt apprehensive about anything green tea flavored, I love actual green tea but gelato and waffles?!  Let's start with the delicious aroma that came wafting out of the kitchen when the batter hit the waffle iron.  Joann and I looked at each other and we knew that it was gonna satiate our inner fat girl cravings for anything sweet.  When they presented our dessert it was masterfully upgraded like Beyonce with her weave...lattice work of some sugary concoctiion under the waffle, green tea macha powder dusted around the Picasso of a waffle and for the ultimate diabetic ending, the green tea gelato on top.  It was not overly sweet but the crunch is what had us..yes, I said crunch.  Brett just stood there watching us eat it and finally fessed up to the ancient Japanese secret..again, nope, not telling' ya.   It had hints of vanilla, and the green tea was most apparent in color but subtle in flavor, it was amazing!  I won't lie, I dreamt about that damn thing for several nights..it was that good!   

To top off the great conversation, service, and food was the prices.  Nori isn't some overpriced place that you can only afford at happy hour (even though that is pretty spectacular as well).  This is someplace that you can take the family and enjoy yourselves and not worry about having to send your kids to wash dishes at the end of the service.  Relaxed atmosphere, beautiful surroundings...count me in again and again (well when I'm home).  Excellent job Nori..thanks Brett for welcoming us and educating us!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, excellent sushi can't think of any recommendations for this location."}
{"text":"I liked it. I think when I order \"spicy yellowtail\" though, there could be a bit more spice. But overall, service was quick and easy, and I still had sushi that tasted great. I just wanted a bit more spice than what comes with the wasabi."}
{"text":"Food was good, fish was fresh and rice was near perfect. Went for lunch and ordered a special. I had to ask for the included miso soup. Waiter  for tea let drink empty twice for some time. Ordered a set of salmon maki, delicious. If service was better, would've gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"I go to Nori in West Hollywood often and enjoy it.  Here half the good items are not on the menu at this location and all the carpaccio a were seared fish which is not a carpaccio. Where is your sishito peppers and your spicy tuna on crispy rice? Would not return."}
{"text":"Well what can I say about Nori Sushi? EVERYTHING!!!! All that is good, all that is great, everything you're looking for sushi related is here! 

We came here after we picked up our 9 year old daughter...it was around 4pm. We were super stoked that they had a happy hour going on. Rolls for $4, yes please!

We also checked in on Yelp and received a complimentary edamame, yeah baby. 

We sat at the sushi bar and Chef was so dang nice to us we had to leave him a good tip in the tip jar. 

I'm watching my carbs so I ordered the lollipop roll and the salmon was soooo fresh. This is now my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"Quality sushi and sashimi here! 

We enjoyed the warm vibe and the scrumptious sushi. I wouldn't say I had the best sushi in my life but it was definitely higher quality than average sushi. 

Service could have been better, though. Although the waitress apologized a few times, our food arrived very late, even the complimentary edamame that you can receive if you check in on Yelp. 

Salmon sashimi was the best, although the quantity was meager."}
{"text":"Tonight we had Mike as a server and he was amazing. Hands down the most knowledgeable server on gluten I've ever had. He double checked everything and made sure it was safe for us to eat (we have celiacs). He also gave us tips on how to order sushi to make sure it's safe. We so appreciate him! 
He suggest a tuna roll with jalapeños in place of spicy tuna. And it was delicious. 
Thanks Mike!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Rolls came out fast just after drink order of Sake. Whole family enjoyed the experience. A place to visit and enjoy atmosphere. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Walked right in and immediately greeted by the friendly hostess. Sat in front of \"Chef Taco\"serving up the sushi with extreme expertise skill. He had a smile as we watched him make the delicious creations. Everything we had was amazing! The coconut shrimp was my favorite. We also enjoyed the crunchy rolls, tempura shrimp and checking in on Yelp got us a free app Edamame!!! It's my birthday and our exceptional waiter \" Mike\" comped my dessert, Creme brûlée... creamy and the perfect size with fresh blueberries and strawberries!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nori has solid sushi.  Rolls and nigiri are decent as they lean toward the traditional - i.e. they don't revel in deep fried sushi or use cream cheese as a staple.  It is more than ample for a sushi fix, but will not go down in your mind as the mother of all sushi experiences.  For those living in the area, Nori is a good local sushi place within stumbling distance.   For those living more than a few miles away, it may not be a destination restaurant as the location is smack in the middle of Suburbia."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Yes, I am so glad we ended up going to Nori instead of anywhere else for our anniversary dinner. 

So my husband and I did not have a chance to make official plans for our 1st wedding anniversary. Sad but true, we ended up just having \"a dinner\" somewhere. No worries though cause our experience at Nori was great! 

We walk in yesterday at around 8:30pm. Not sure if it was too late to be dining in a restaurant or particularly because it was Sunday but there was only 1 occupied table inside and one outside. This kind of discouraged us at the beginning but we were so hungry and particularly in the mood for sushi, we decided, oh well, we'll give it a try anyway. We were offered a seat anywhere so we chose a table and sat to review the menu. The server (who at this point was also the seating hostess) asked us what we'd like to drink. We just ordered water, came out in a sec. We were given sometime to look at the menu and she came back to ask for our appetizers. Well guess what, you are offered a free Edamame when you check in. They honored that and we got are hot salty edamame. Great start. 

We ordered 5 sushi rolls off the menu. I cannot remember all the names (I was in a hurry to eat!) but I've included pics of what we ordered. The first three orders came out when we finished our edamame. Out of the first three, our least favorite was the Sakana. It was good but not as good as the rest of our order. The next two sushi rolls took a little while to come out but that was because we had a baked order I guess. We selected 2 baked rolls it seems. One came out before the other but no worries, they were both so worth it!

The food was delicious!! The presentation absolutely wonderful and the portion size is just right! I am so pleased with the food there I am definitely going back again soon! The ambience was also great and the music was very suitable for an evening out for dinner. The prices are average with their specialty sushi rolls ranging from $14-$16. With 5 sushi a (4 special) and 1 of the more expensive ones from the regular menu. We ended up paying $78 (inclusive of tax). For the quality we had yest, we didn't mind that at all! 

Give this place a try Yelpers! You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous little place, nice ambiance, friendly and personable staff, quick in and out at what should have been the lunch rush.  Prices are competitive, as are the portions.

Checked out the happy hour menu, wish it didn't end before I get out of work (6pm)

Try it."}
{"text":"They do it right here.  That's pretty much all you need to know.  The fish is exquisitely fresh, and while the price for a meal can get up there if you're ordering a slew of nigiri it's worth it!  I'd much rather pay more for something that I know is fresh than go to some place with conveyer belt sushi serving crap.  I also like the fact that the sushi chefs are Japanese which at least creates the illusion that they know what they're doing more than someone who had on the job training in Arizona."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is fantastic. This review is for the service. 

My friends and I eat here almost every other week for the past year...never again. The host is always awkward never knowing where to seat, the servers consistently mess up orders at every visit. Beverages always come out randomly and even after food (including water). When it comes to the bill, don't even attempt to ask for the Check split if you want it right. Even if you announce it at seating. 

The last straw for us was the extremely rude and disrespectful manger. When I presented a $10 gift card coupon to use with my Check he informed me I could not use it at this visit, that I had to use it at a future visit. The copy clearly stated that I could in fact use it at my current meal. The server even informed me that multiple people had also brought this to their attention that day. Instead of letting me use it on our tables large bill, he told me that I could not with anger and threw his hands up in the air and snarled at me and walked away mid conversation! He has zero people skills. 

This is an expensive restaurant and my whole table was shocked with how this manager treated us. 

We will try the other location and see if we have better service."}
{"text":"Loved the sushi at Nori - the service was great, and sushi tasty.  Need to check out happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon sashimi, a rainbow roll, and a shrimp tempura roll. Everything was fresh and delicious! The iced green tea was fantastic too. I am so happy to have found a sushi place of this caliber so close to home!"}
{"text":"We have found our favorite Sushi place! I loved it here. Everyone was super friendly and helpful from our servers to the GM. I don't need to look any further and it's right in my neighborhood! We had several rolls, all good and filling. Can't wait to try more......And sit on the patio when the weather cools off. It looks very relaxing."}
{"text":"Great little spot for fresh and different sushi. Saw it go into our little shopping center and finally got the DH to go. Boy are we glad! 
Great food, fair prices, nice servings and really fun and friendly service. We've been twice and we're hooked. Found a new strawberry sake that is cool, refreshing and smooth. The Seafood Green Onion Pancake is like an asian quiche minus all the eggs. Big enough to split too. Hubs had three kinds of rolls, California roll, a panko roll and Shrimp tempura. Oh and the coconut shrimp was tasty but a little oily for my taste. We had Michael as our server both afternoons and he could not have been nicer. 
TRY the chocolate lava cake with fresh strawberries! SO good! Really recommend this place! Coming back very soon for more!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place. We've seen it passing through the Basha's parking lot. Wow! Nori deserves your attention. The sushi was remarkable. Compared to certain other sushi restaurants in the area that I'll leave unnamed, the sushi here was beyond delicious. We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender, Chris. He recommended our drinks and our entrees and everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. The service was outstanding. Quality and freshness superb! Will be going back very soon to this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Terrific sushi, Service needs a little work, would been five stars if it wasn't for our server. I ordered a lot of sushi that was not on the menu and the sushi chefs we are incredibly accommodating"}
{"text":"Hamachi Roll is amazing! Great neighborhood spot - staff is friendly, everything we've tried has been flavorful and fresh. 2nd time we ordered by phone for pick-up for a quick dinner at home and it was thoughtfully packaged and ready to go."}
{"text":"Great sushi with very generous portions and sooo fresh! The salmon nigiri was outstanding! Will definitely be our neighborhood sushi hangout, and they have a great happy hour menu!
The service was great, everyone was so friendly and our server Jennifer was great with recommendations  and obviously loves working at Nori!"}
{"text":"Have made going to Nori Sushi a main stay since moving back to Scottsdale 3 years ago. The sushi and other menu options are always made just right and the service and usual limited wait time even adds to their lure. 
Even my 7 year old daughter who is a very picky eater and is not a fan of fish, will often devour their salmon filet when ordered.
They even accommodated her request for coloring material even though it was not the norm for them to do so.
If you like consistently great food and service, this is definitely a spot to try."}
{"text":"Such fresh fish, like it just came off the boat!  All of our sushi was amazing and we tried a bit of everything at our table. No overpowering sauces or gravy-like cover ups here. The fish took center stage. Enjoyed the fried tofu appetizer, too!  Great place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service :( the restaurant was almost empty and it was a few hours till close...we received no greeting and stood around for a while; after approaching the sushi chef he said we could seat ourselves, so we did...it took several more minutes for a waitress to come.

I look at the menu for a while and decide on teriyaki chicken which came with a salad...after what seemed like FOREVER, the waitress came to take our order. Guess what??? She said I can't order that because she gave me the lunch menu. I ask for the dinner chicken teriyaki, which she say does not come with a salad. I'm disappointed, but no big deal.

It takes even LONGER to get our meal, which was picture perfect when it arrived. However, the chicken was very dry, there was very little teriyaki sauce to compensate, and the veggies were practically raw with a little sauce over them... It doesn't end there...we order a green tea waffle dessert which had decent flavor but was inedible because it had the texture of raw bread dough thought eeeewwww...

Anyways, the actual sushi was okay; I would not come back here seeing as there are probably a dozen other sushi places in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Me and my friend sat on the patio during happy hour.  You definitely do not feel like you are in a strip mall when relaxing by the fountain and enjoying the view of McDowell Mountains! The service was outstanding and the Happy Hour menu is great!  We had the seaweed salad...very fresh!  I usually avoid the seaweed salad once I learned that it is often soaked in a high fructose corn syrup liquid. But not at Nori!!! It is made fresh! My friend had a mixed drink.  I cannot remember the name (I posted a picture) but i had a sip and it was so tasty!! It was made with Asian lemons and local honey, garnished with a sprig of rosemary.  I cannot remember the name of the sushi restaurant that previously occupied this space (which wasn't bad), but Nori is SO much better. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am so excited about this place! It was totally perfection! I'm originally from SoCal and the quality of sushi I've had thus far in the area has been mediocre. We live up the street from this place and decided to try it based on yelp reviews. So happy we did, it's a total gem. My husband had the scallops, we had a baked lobster and a tuna tataki roll. We would order every single dish again! Lindsay our waitress was great as well. It just tastes fresh ... Finally! We have already declared ourselves regulars. Thank you for opening a location in Mcdowell!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi place! We were traveling to Scottsdale and have tried sushi in every town we travel to but this place is a a gem! Great service, great atmosphere and top quality sushi! Definitely a must visit for our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner, looking forward to trying a new sushi place. The main thing I left with is how SLOW the service was (or more likely how long the kitchen/sushi chefs took to make the food). Literally all we ordered was a chicken skewer appetizer and two single orders of sushi, and the restaurant was not at all busy, so I have no idea why it took so long. It was also awkward how they brought out one order of sushi long before the other (my husband was nearly finished eating his by the time mine came out). The other biggest negative was the cost for the food. Veggie rolls (6 small pieces) are $7. And three TINY chicken skewers are $7 too. The food was decent (I'd say a 6-7 out of 10), but not worth the wait or the cost. One more thing to mention is they sat us right next to a table with a family with two small children who were very loud and obnoxious the entire meal. The kids being loud isn't the restaurant's fault, but as I had mentioned, it was quite empty in there, and an experienced staff would know to look for a quieter area of the restaurant without small children in which to seat a young couple clearly looking for a more \"date night\" feel."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is excellent.  The outside is uninspiring with its strip mall location, but inside is charming.  What makes this place great is the fresh and delicious food.  I had the filet mignon which was tender and wonderful and quite spicy in a yummy way.  Everything was high quality including the miso soup and the edamame.  I also had an order of salmon sashimi which was perfect.  Our waitress was lovely and attentive.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it wasn't particularly inventive but that takes nothing away from how good this place is."}
{"text":"When you are a relatively new resident of the Phoenix metro area, it is quite easy to get your bearings wrong relative to whether a business is located in Phoenix or in Scottsdale. So what's the big deal?
The big deal is that I posted my original review for this restaurant under their Scottsdale location whereas I was reviewing their Phoenix location. So what's the big deal you ask again?
The big deal is that the two locations are like Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Hyde. 
I have in the last year visited both locations a number of times and this review is intended to set the record straight. 
I still stand by my original review but that relates to the Phoenix location. My multiple experiences at the Scottsdale location have been highly sub-standard. 
Earlier this evening my 2 grandkids and I along with their Dad spent an evening from hell at the Scottsdale location. 
The quality of food was not bad. But the service? It was service from the devil himself. And BTW it wasn't all the server's fault: it was the kitchen, the sushi chefs and the front of the house. Seldom do you see critical failures at all these touch points. Somehow these guys managed to accomplish it. Bravo!!!!
At every juncture the excuse was: \"we have a party of 20 and that has created all kinds of problems\". Oh, so anytime more than the usual number of customers show up, it takes upwards of 30 minutes to bring out mochi for the kids. Were you making it after the order was placed or was it being delivered from Japan. 
Get this: you order Shrimp Tempura and they bring out Maki. You send it back and 15 minutes later they bring the same damn thing again. It was, this evening, a comedy of errors (but really not funny). 
So my friends at Nori, Scottsdale I bid you adieu forever. Nobody deserves this pathetic service."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from the miso soup to the sushi rolls. Best California roll iv ever had. The baked lobster roll was TO DIE FOR, was creamy crunchy and savory. The service was great as well, my server never let out waters go empty and we drink a lot of water. No complaints what so ever. Loved the atmosphere also the patio is great, loved the waterfalls."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I've had in the valley.  I'm so happy that they replaced the mediocre-at-best place that formerly occupied this space.  The sushi was very fresh, nicely presented and delicious.  This should give you an indication of the quality that they put out: bluefin toro flown in from Spain!

They were busy and the service was a little spotty although friendly.  The manager was all over it though, hustling and doing everything he could to assist.  That makes a huge difference, even when the waitstaff is struggling a bit. 

Unfortunately, it's pretty unique to have a restaurant that focuses on quality food in this area.  Most other nearby places are all show with blah food.  Not here.  The food takes center stage and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"There is a \"but\" coming, however, first let me say the food was delicious and the ambiance was terrific, as usual. I've been here a few times now, as well as other locations, and the food is always spot-on.  BUT, tonight I came in to celebrate my birthday, and despite telling my sushi chef and waitress...nothing, nada, zilch.  I didn't need anything comped, but something to make my experience special would have been, well, special. Instead I left feeling unimportant. Oh well."}
{"text":"The food was great, unfortunately, the service was very poor. Granted they had a large party to accommodate but somethings were inexcusable: 30 minutes to bring our mochi order, bringing out a wrong entree order not once BUT TWICE, and not knowing how many pieces would come in the sashimi platter. Also, other than platitudes, we didn't get much else--a better run establishment would have offered more concessions besides deducting ONLY ONE order of mochi. The Desert Ridge location definitely runs a tighter ship. Not sure i'll be back to this location..."}
{"text":"I took myself on a date here for the first time and sat on the patio! It was quiet, clean and relaxing. I ordered the spicy sashimi salad and hamachi, both were amazing and really fresh. Kristina was my server and she was really sweet and efficient. She didn't come over too much and had perfect timing. My new favorite sushi place"}
{"text":"I have lived in scottsdale for 5 months now and have yet to find a sushi place I loved.. Until I found nori & it's right down the road from me! 

The portions are huge and everything taste fresh & great! The waitress was knowledgable on everything & her recommendations were spot on. 

Only reason I gave it a four star because the price was a bit much, but not horrible. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sitting at bar, the bar was dirty, waited forever for food .. got my edamame, then waited 40 mins for first roll .. been here for almost 2 hrs and still don't have the remainder of our food ... bartender us nice, but they pare clearly understaffed .. sushi roll was ok."}
{"text":"I ate here recently and was really impressed.  Phoenix area in general doesn't have the best sushi scene in the world.  Nori, however, reminds me of the kind of quality sushi joint you would find in Seattle or LA.  Great ambiance, creative sushi, and incredible bar make it the best sushi establishment in the valley."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, reasonable prices and a great atmosphere! I tried the tempura shrimp and spicy tuna roll. We also had teriyaki beef! They have a terrific happy hour. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great place. Still new so it was not that busy. We sat outside and the ambience was perfect. There was a waterfall and the heaters kept us warm. Everyone was really attentive and went out of their way to be helpful; they let us try the \"real\" wasabi and brought me a cute little desserts for my birthday that worked with my food allergies. Michael was our server and he was entertaining and nice. 

The food was great. We had edamame, miso, and galbi (pork) for appetizers. They were all better than average. The sushi was fresh. We had the tuna tataki roll, tuna roll, shrimp and tuna nigiri, and cali roll. 

I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio on a cool evening. Great, cozy, quiet atmosphere. Our waiter, T.J., was friendly, polite, & knowledgeable -will ask to sit at one of his tables again. We came here wanting to try the green tea waffle & gelato, and should have taken the advice of the reviewer who said \"eat dessert first.\" Ok..next time. I started with edamame and a seaweed & sesame salad. Both were fresh, light, & tasty. I ordered a baked lobster roll and it was over the top delicious. It had a scrumptious rich sauce and I just couldn't make it to that daggone waffle...I will go here as #1 choice for date night!"}
{"text":"Such a classy place now that Nori moved in! Sat on the patio, just wanted a quick happy hour beer and roll. We had sweet & chili tofu which was unique and delish! Also Las Vegas roll which was great, too. The plants and waterfall are relaxing and the menus on wooden boards were really awesome! I do not remember our waitress's name, however she was exceptional and checked on us several times. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent food and ambiance. We came here for a birthday dinner with a larger group. The service was very inattentive, we were all going to order more but everything was taking so long we decided not to and then had to wait forever for the check. After asking our waitress twice for separate checks she still brought it all on one bill. After asking her again she walked away with a sign saying \"this is going to take a while\". She came back a few minutes later and set the entire bill down asking us if we could separate it ourselves. Like really? Service ruined it for me"}
{"text":"Great food, pleasant staff, nice atmosphere - what more could you ask for?
If only the green tea waffle dessert was calorie free...."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday afternoon for lunch and surprisingly, was greeted with a half empty restaurant. The restaurant was very cold and unwelcoming even though our server was nice. She was the only server and was also the host sitting people so it was tough to get her attention at times. I was cold that I was shivering throughout the whole dining experience. Even ordering miso soup didn't warm me up. 

We decided on the ahi tuna poki, the hamachi fire roll and the nori tempura roll. Prices are on the high side and the portions are not generous. My favorite was  the ahi poki. The hamachi fire was spicy and the nori tempura was really spicy!! If you like spicy food, then you should order this. Although, for 6 pieces at $15, I would rather order something or even order somewhere else. 

Overall, it was good but again, a tad bit expensive and the atmosphere/restaurant didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place in town! We ordered the eel avocado roll, the Nori tempura roll, and the incredibly delicious baked lobster tempura roll. I cannot stress how incredibly good this lobster roll was, I could eat it every day of my life and it would never disappoint. Do yourself a favor and order it. We went when it was slow so we had the entire place to ourselves. Service was great, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh sushi. I have eaten here many times and it never fails to impress. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Living in Scottadale I had come to expect that I wouldn't ever find amazing Japanese food, let me say all of that was shattered on my visit to Nori. 

Having been to Japan and had local cuisine, I can say that Nori is by far the best sushi and sashimi that I've had in the USA. The atmosphere in the restaurant is peaceful and the decor is minimalist with light background music and you have a great view of the sushi bar from any of the tables. 

The food was simply outstanding! Delicious, fresh and flavorful sashimi, nothing stale or old tasting!! I went at lunch and had the Sashimi Special with Tuna, Yellowtail and Salmon(my favorite) all of the food was delivered to our table quickly and our server was so amazing, her recommendation of the Tuna Tataki roll was excellent!

I sat there enjoying my lunch and looking through my pics of my most recent trip to Japan, it made me decide I need to go back soon! 

Nori, your amazing and I will spread the word and continue to enjoy your amazing food, often!"}
{"text":"This place is immaculate, has great service and off the beaten path.    We enjoyed our time here, but I gotta admit it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had.   The imitation crab meat is kind of the dividing line for me.   They rocked the hell out of it up until the sushi came out, but that, and and the limited menu of rolls knocked a couple of stars off for me.   Pay no attention to me, I'm a bit of sushi snob.   

What they have, they OWN.   It's a nice place, but I've had better for the price. 

Ergh, It didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Delightful! Went there for lunch and had the Salmon Bento Box. Saw another diner eating the Tempura Shrimp and Vegetable Bento which also looked delicious. The Bento comes with Miso soup which was very good and there are generous portions of rice, salad, stir-fried veggies and gyoza with the meat or fish choice. The iced green tea was the best I have had. Was not expecting the matcha and that was a nice surprise from the typical watery/weak green ice tea at most restaurants. The service was great from Emily and I enjoyed sitting on the patio next to their water feature. The music was a little different but other than that, a tranquil spot to enjoy a nice lunch.  While I have not tried the sushi, I am giving 5 stars for my first time Nori experience!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!!!  TJ and the other team members are awesome!!!!   Super fresh fish, including amazing Toro.  It's my Valley favorite right now."}
{"text":"Sushi and miso was good 4/5* - nothing exceptional, just standard Japanese sushi in Arizona. Not sure they're wanting new customers as the staff was in no hurry to seat us, take our order, bring us food or bring us the check. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Came here with the kids after swim lessons.  Both of them inhaled their lunch and asked for more.  Prices are slightly high for tempura roll and spider roll, but very fair for the California Rolls and squid nigiri.  Both kids have already asked to come back again.  Manager offered to buy the kids dessert after hearing about my son's ballgame.  Extra touches like that make a big difference."}
{"text":"great miso soup. sushi really fresh and artfully prepared. Don't skip dessert. The green tea gelato and waffle was a shockingly delicious surprise!"}
{"text":"Check in here and you get 1 free serving of edemame.

Had lunch here for the first time and I was the first customer walked in at 11:45, but the place was empty until I left around 12:45pm. There were few people at the restaurant, but most of the tables were available. 

I had spicy tuna rolls which was average, green tea was good and the ice cream mochi mango and green tea flavor was yummy!

The waiter was nice, the restaurant itself look very clean and up to date decor. The only thing that this restaurant missing is the ambiance, where are the customers??"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and I never encountered the issues with service like others. The lunch bento boxes are tasty and each option is tasty - the BBQ ribs are my favorite.The green tea waffle with vanilla ice cream is worth the extra miles on the treadmill!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot. Fresh sushi and excellent service.  Great happy hour too!   I love their hand rolls and the sea bass is outstanding."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Fresh, buttery, melts in your mouth fish. As an avid, picky, sushi lover this is the best sushi bar in town! It's not an Americanized, heavily sauced, deep fried type of sushi bar, it's more of a traditional style with a flair type of sushi bar. I pretty much tried every fish they serve and I am amazed at the quality, texture and freshness. From their rice to their sauces are light and simple yet the complexity of the flavors make my mouth taste like heaven. They also make their own tamago (sweet egg) which was amazing. Lol a bit much? Well I'm not exaggerating it was amazing."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and all the food I ordered was delicious. They have toro here, fatty tuna. This is only offered at the finest joints. Came in for happy hour and ordered some specials and the chicken yakitori which was fantastic. I ordered a beer and they said I could add sake for only 1$ more. Wow what a steal of a deal!  3 skewers of chicken for only $4!  This is not the same place that used to be here so if you think you've been here better be sure!"}
{"text":"good experience  ! People are nice, chef very good! I like chef who put wasabi into nigiri and they did it. Fish very fresh ! 30mins from my home and I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Changing to two stars because the service is just really terrible. By the time your whole order is ready half your food is cold. So disappointing because I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN, the best sushi I've had in Scottsdale. The fish was so fresh and cold.. Mmm. Just melted in my mouth. 
The chili garlic edamame was sooooo good too! Definitely order the specialty rolls. I ordered two of them and don't have a pic because I ate them too fast! Emily our server was top notch. She was attentive and so sweet! I can't wait to come back! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for sushi. Their happy hour is solid, great service and the food has been great the 3 or 4 times I've been there. My biggest recommendation is their green tea waffle, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've been exploring all the foodie places around in my  neighborhood and can't believe it took me over two years to find this spot! I was craving some serious sushi, and typed  into maps the places around me. I had to venture a little out of my normal bubble in North Scottsdale, but not far at all, and soooo glad I did! It's right off the Main Street, Bell, but hidden in the tucked away shopping center next to Bashas grocery store (and almost adjacent from The Vig. 

I went on a Sunday afternoon and beat the rush after lunch. The place was super clean and everyone was immediately very friendly when I walked in the door (but not the annoying kind where they pretty much attack you with awkward hellos  ). 

I peeped the rolls, placed a take out order and my two rolls were ready in about 7 minutes, which was super fast for the two other groups that were already in there waiting on food. The host was SO friendly, and came over to chat with me at the bar while I waited for my food. I asked him about HH, and now I definitely want to go back for that. $5 select rolls, apps and booze! Can't beat that, especially at such a nice place.

This place on average $15/a roll, but SO worth it. Both of my rolls were so incredibly yummy, and I'm sure everything else on the menus is, too. I had the Big Eye Diver (jalapeños spicy yummmm) and the Caterpillar rolls, SO TASTY!! 

Can't wait to try the other selections! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their edamame was pretty damn incredible.  As for their sushi, it was just good.  I wasn't blown away by it, but it was fine.  I'd come here again if others wanted to, but it wouldn't be first on my list for sushi.  

Service was great. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty Dressy Eaters (instagram: @pretrydressyeaters) Back in town and this place gets friendlier and cooler every time we come here. Adrian the bartender is personable and knowledgeable about the menu which gets better every time we are here. It's never very busy, but that's the awesome part about it."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, friendly staff, service is quick and food is fantastic. The poki with sprinkles of doritos, I know...different but... excited my pallet like no other. The sushi is like butter, melts in your mouth, and the tempura is not greasy, not heavy , just right. One place that I will be coming back to for a long time. Customer service is excellent, their ice green tea is awesome. Lots of parking and was able to be seated right away without any reservations. Their signature sushi plates are all very tasty and all reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever. Why? Because there was NO sushi. Beginning with a waiter who did not know his product, I should have known this would be bad. The party was myself and one other. While he was served I waited over twenty minutes before the hostess picked up on that we were upset. We had been talking about leaving in order to actually be served food. This was after our drinks had been filled multiple times. After people who arrived after us were served. After people who had placed pick-up orders at the bar had been fulfilled and left. I was so disappointed. The hostess asked the chef how long my order would take, because we were beyond done. The chef thought maybe five more minutes. Yet of the three chefs working tonight, only two were actually working. The third, a scruffy looking man, was busy holding the counter and wall in place. Quite disheartening. I stated to our hostess I was not interested in waiting any longer. Then the chef started calling me out trying to convince me to stay by yelling across the restaurant. I left. The other party with me asked for the check. Upon not being given it after much time, he gave up. He went to the hostess station, asked when they opened the next day and stated he would be back to pay for what we did have the next day.. Maybe when they had time to pay attention to us. At that point, he left. That is when all of a sudden someone cared. A man who never identified himself by name or position ran after our car after we walked to our car, we were pulled out of our space and almost passed the location. He yelled at us. The party I was with returned to the restaurant to settle the tab there and then. What was he given? A check for drinks, the food he had been given AND THE FOOD WE NEVER RECEIVED. What a joke. The party I was with paid for what we were given and gave an almost ten dollar tip to the hostess who at least acknowledged there was a problem. The restaurant is a farce. It is an insult. I will highly promote how horrible our experience was wherever I can at this point. Especially since the two of us went to the competition within ten miles and after ordering a similar order by a staff who were more plentiful and actually doing more than standing around, we had our complete meal in five minutes. Yes, five. We actually timed it due to our frustration. That broke it for us. A wonderful time was had, but certainly not at Nori."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and appetizers! Ordered the lobster roll, spicy tuna roll and California roll. Had the chicken lollipops and salted edamame.... and of course to end the meal a green tea waffle with green tea ice cream.
Everything was awesome! The service was attentive and helpful while ordering."}
{"text":"This place is hands down unbeatable, I've been here on many occasions and haven't had a bad server yet. As a matter of fact all the servers I've had have been outstanding! On our most recent trip we came for happy hour and ordered 3 rolls: California roll, a spicy salmon roll, and a Las Vegas roll. For drinks we had house flavored sake (pomegranate) and a bottle of nigori sake. Lastly we had a green tea waffle and vanilla bean ice cream for dessert and it was AMAZING!!! A must try! The bill was 41 dollars, yes FORTY-ONE! That is incredibly reasonable for the quality of food, drinks, and service here. Do yourself and try this place (and happy hour) NOW!"}
{"text":"So happy to have this place here in McDowell Mountain Ranch!  We have been here 3 times now and every time it is better than the last!  Every time has been wonderful.  Highly Recommended.  They even have the  difficult to find Echigo beer that I absolutely love!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi.
Great place for quiet cocktails.
Staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"My friend and I haven't been here in awhile, craving sushi, and was in the area for lunch, this was our go to place. Nothing has changed, great service and great sushi. I noticed some of the staff has changed, but didn't change the quality of service.

We sat at the Sushi Bar and ordered Yellowtail, Salmon, Uni and Fresh Water Eel Nigiri, all fresh and tasted fantastic. Upon receiving the check and paying with a Gift Card, we ran into an issue with our card which was quickly resolved by the Manager. Thank you!

Love this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is my international healthy and happy place! Will be back again soon. My fav is their spicy sashimi salad paired with a wonderful glass of Dark Horse. Yum!"}
{"text":"My daughter, her fiancé and I had dinner there last night. Everything was delicious!!!  The green tea cream bruelle was really good. Yummy. My only concern was the menu. It was disjointed and I do not think everything they have is on it. I could be wrong, but I think they should make the menu easier to decipher.  Very tasty sushi and shrimp tempura."}
{"text":"Need to leave a second review on this one.  We've been here several times because it's in the neighborhood.  Wow.  Amazing lobster roll tonight,  as well as other dishes.  Better than sushi brokers and Pure.  Delicious."}
{"text":"I love my FISH, I love my sushis and ramen. Before moving here someone once told me \"Don't eat any sushi places in Arizona it's not the same as in Hawaii!\" Well ummmm I really really have to disagree with that person a total 100%? what in the world was he talking about... Never ever listen to that statement cuz it's in the desert!

This place is/was amazing! My hubby wasn't feeling well so we went out looking for a ramen place and of course we used Yelp! Mahalo Yelp for your findings! Low and behold we drove up to this finding!

It was already late in the afternoon, hardly anyone in there so it was nice and quiet! The food is really good! They are known for their sushi and udon noodles and I'm sure many more!

Nice customer service very quaint and food came out quickly. Ramen that we ordered was okay nothing to spectacular with the broth and noodles, but, the sushi was really good and tasty! We will be back for their happy hour selection 

I'm glad I did not listen to a friend whose a fool and knows nothing about eating sushi in Arizona! What he's missing out!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"You have to try Nori's happy hour menu. Pretty amazing they charge so little for such high grade fish and high quality prep. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We found this gem while visiting Scottsdale! Chris the bartender was so helpful and nice! We ended up getting take out 3 times over the 6 day visit! Food uis PERFECT and fish super fresh! All in all a 10"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  There are not very many places that I will trust eating sushi.  But, I do not hesitate to eat everything on the menu.  it's all fabulous and extremely fresh!  The people I've sent here have gone back several times.  I go here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The lobster roll was amazing! So was the hamachi collar. I would recommend coming here anytime. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in here randomly on a Friday afternoon around 2:30pm when most sushi restaurants are closed. We were still given the lunch special pricing menu which featured bento boxes and sushi/sashimi specials. I opted for the chefs choice nigiri plate (7pcs) and the fish was awesome! Perfectly cut in thickness and length sitting atop perfectly seasoned rice. Thanks to Yelp we also got a free bowl of edamame for checking in.

FYI, the miso soup comes with mushrooms in it, which I liked but my friend was taken surprise at. If you are allergic or don't care for mushrooms, please take pre-caution.

Bonus: Shinbay is the celebrity chef at this restaurant!  He has a small side menu of 4 items he prepares for Nori. My next visit will definitely include these dishes as I was a fan of his former restaurant. And yes, his famous Omakase is on the menu!! Shinbay's Omakase is the reason omakase would be my last meal on earth (if you check out my Yelp profile)."}
{"text":"I love Nori! They have great lunch specials that run till 2 or 3. The fish is flown in from California a few times a week. It's the freshest sushi your get in Arizona. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Very satisfied! Great music, vibe and prices. We sat on the patio right next to their fountain. It is a very nice set up and we will definitely be back. Service was also excellent!"}
{"text":"The sushi is awesome, for an Arizona spot. Uni is the best in town. The wait staff is good, usually always friendly and quick, but the sushi chef's are unbelieverably rude. Horrible attitude, and mostly never respond to anything you say. My 6 year old daughter said thank you and they said nothing. I come for the good sushi but the vibe is terrible and  it makes me not want to come. I literally only come for the sushi craving and would almost rather drive to Los Angeles and go to a real sushi restaurant that knows how to treat people that spend hundreds of dollars on sushi. And we tip 25/30 percent on top of our bill. I work in the restaurant business and know how it's supposed to be done. Go here for the sushi, but don't expect to be treated well. #bitchdontkillmyvibe #sushiconnoisuer"}
{"text":"Service was poor and sushi was lackluster. 

We sat at the bar to wait for a table outside to be cleared and weren't greeted when we sat down- very unusual. We pretty much got the \"give me 1 minute\" finger instead. A minute or two later and still no \"hello\" or \"I will be right with you.\" We decided not to sit at the bar and wait for our table- what's the point without any service!?!!

When we were taken to our table it was not even cleared yet and there were several other tables that still had dirty dishes hanging around. Gross- no one wants to see that. 

Wasabi wasn't \"spicy\" and the sushi was just OK. 

We left and finished our sushi Friday at another restaurant. 

Do not waste your time if you appreciate good Sushi."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, cocktails and appetizers. The service was terrific and staff was very friendly. Definitely try the coconut shrimp and caterpillar roll!! Yum. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ahi poke is very good. Jiampong soup is ok / average. Overpriced. Server is really nice. Receptionist is ok. Will not come back due to price."}
{"text":"A solid sushi joint in N Scottsdale. Their prices are very reasonable  (even outside of HH) and the sushi is spot on. Don't forget to check in on yelp for a free steamed bowl of edamame. The patio is also very calming on a nice night. Enjoy! ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"I have had better sushi but this place is decent. I think the best part is actually the kids meals. They come with lots of options so I know my kids will at least eat something on their adorable sectioned plate!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. The Maki are large, fresh and tasty. The service was very good. The double dragon roll was exceptional. The only down side was the price. Very expensive. A bit pricey for a family meal. Some of the best miso I've had in town."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here! Came from SF 9 years ago w/ the best quality sushi.  Finally we have a local sushi restaurant, Nori, near our home that rivals Ebisu, SF, CA! The fish is top quality, served beautifully over ice. The chefs are Japanese artists & the staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"We LOVE-LOVE-LOVE Nori! Every time we go anywhere else, we always say, \"It's not as good as NORI!\" My husband is half-Japanese, so we eat Japanese food 1-2X/week. We always order salmon sushi, a Cali roll, steak skewers, the baked lobster specialty roll and my middle daughter loves the dessert of a hot green tea waffle w/ green tea ice cream!  We love the. cute little Scottsdale location east of the 101 @ Bell & Thompson Peak (by Basha's), however the Desert Ridge location is bigger and busier. Happy hour is alway terrific!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite sushi place. They are quick, have the best servers and the food is delicious! Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Try pure sushi. So much fresher and better tasting.
Ordered 4 sushi rolls here. People super friendly. Service was fine. The sushi just doesn't taste fresh or flavorful"}
{"text":"Tonight was my 2nd time to Nori Sushi and again they delivered excellent food and service.  I went for happy hour and the prices were low enough that I tried an assortment of their offerings and they were all good.  

Our waitress Jenny was super friendly and down to earth.  Our bartender Burke is so down to earth and friendly and makes amazing cocktails like their aviation and french 75.  

Service alone I would say is 5 stars, but coupled with their food its a must to visit them.

I'm from Hawaii so I really enjoy good sushi and their sushi chefs from Japan are top notch and offer great dishes.

This is probably one place that I would want to be a regular.  

If you're a local or visiting Scottsdale, you should definitely visit Nori."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour sushi specials! The food is fresh, exciting (they make things for you that are not on the menu if you ask) and delicious.  We come here at least once a week - it's terrific!!!"}
{"text":"Very bad sushi experience! talked to will twice on the phone, once to make a reservation and again when we were ten minutes away. the first time I told him I had never been there and that we only go out weekly to Sushi because my wife will not pay to eat anything else. Will told me that he was going to make this a very special experience. He asked if there was a special occasion, I replied yes, we were celebrating two birthdays, my wife's and brother-in-law's. he  said great, what do they like, i said my brother-in-law likes deserts, my wife sushi. he said great, I will do something really special. When I called the second time to let him know we may be a few minutes late, he said no worries, and said he will make it special. 
We arrived and my sister and her husband were already seated via the reservation, they had them around the corner against the wall and next to a storage area, completely ugly location and the place was almost empty.

 It took forever to get any service and then for the drinks to arrive. I ordered  appetizers for the table, then we ordered dinner, we ordered Sushi and the other couple ordered off the menu. They brought the Sushi before the appetizers. There was no room for much and it was getting crowed on this small table. when we finished the appetizers, they never took our plates, in fact they never took any plates.The other dinners arrived now we were just uncomfortable and were no enjoying the experience.

We ordered a dessert and they still did not take the plates until we had to call them over, then they only took some of them. The dessert came and there was no mention of any birthday or anything special as promised in sushi for my wife's birthday.

We go out at least once a week with friends and spend around $150 like we did here, and more often by our selves and spend about $50-$75. The Sushi portions were very small too! 

. I had a conversation via Facebook when the phones were down and I was trying to make a reservation, the person from the Facebook site, responded immediately, but when I posted this same private message to that sane site hoping to get an apology, nobody ever replied and why I decided to post this after giving them the opportunity to respond.

I would not waste your money on this place and I see why on a Saturday night it was almost empty"}
{"text":"What a surprise! This unassuming restaurant caught my eye with Flame Heaters outside for the comfort of diners. The food was exceptional! The quality, texture and flavor of the sushi was a welcome surprise. The crab cake was excellent. The seafood soup was packed with shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels, noodles and vegetables. I have never tasted anything like this. The dessert was delightful. The waiter Shawna was pleasant, knowledgeable, professional and provided fast service. The restaurant was clean and ambiance pleasant."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and asked the sushi chef what was the freshest fish. Well, he was right, it was DELICIOUS! Too bad we don't travel or live closer. The restaurant is located in a strip mall, but don't let that stop you from enjoying fresh, amazing food! 

He's quite funny too! We went to a spa earlier and the spa gave us some bath salts and when he saw the bag ripped open in my purse, he gave me a funny look and joked I had some substance leaking and it didn't look appropriate. We all had a good laugh, but my daughter was embarrassed."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok. Not bad, but nothing to rave about. The one star is for the chef. What an a**hole.  I'm talking about the skinny, clean-shaven, douche with the glasses. He      didn't say hello, didn't say welcome, didn't even smile. To be honest, I don't think he even looked up at me once. The only words he said to me were, \"anything else?\" Didn't even say thank you when I asked for the check.  He puts out a very off-putting vibe. And, considering there was not a single other soul in the place, and I sat right in front of him, it made for a very uncomfortable 30 minutes.

To the chef who served me - use the $.52 tip I left you to buy a personality.

To the owners and management - get rid of that guy. He's the reason why your restaurant is empty during peak lunch hour."}
{"text":"Have to change our normal 5 star rating for Nori to a 1. Last time we visited we ate here twice and were so happy with service and quality of the food. This time we got here around 11:30. There was only one other table the entire time we ate. One person in our party ordered a bento box which arrived 25 minutes prior to our sushi rolls. I ordered a simple spicy tuna roll which was bland. My husband ordered the ahi tuna tataki which was mediocre at best. Ten minutes later his big eye diver came out. It was supposed to have scallops inside instead it was a mayonnaise mess with what looked like imitation crap. My husband ate 2 pieces and left the rest. The server was quick to get us out and didn't seem very apologetic about the wait or food quality. My parents own a restaurant and when that much food is left untouched it's usually because of the taste. Yet this server just cleared it away, never asking if we enjoyed our meal. After a $65 lunch ticket, waiting forever for crappy food and still being hungry, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Over priced and over rated. Wont be back. Service was good but the food was not exceptional. I would rather eat grocery store sushi. 15.00 for one specialty roll? Come on! I can get way better rolls for under 10.00. I don't know how they got this many stars obviously friends and family must be reviewing! Some of the worst sushi I have ever eaten. Btw I used to live in Hawaii. I know my sushi!"}
{"text":"Nori sushi was actually pretty good - between this location and the Desert Ridge location, I liked this one more. There were two Koreans and one Japanese guy working at the sushi counter. I had an amaebi (sweet raw shrimp) nigiri, aji (Spanish mackerel) nigiri, hotate (scallop) nigiri, and a roll with crab. The rice was on the less sweet side, as it should be. The fish was fresh and the service was quick. They do have a lot of drink options as well as some appetizers and entrees, but I would come back again just for the nigiri sushi. If you're nearby, this place is a good option - but I wouldn't go out of the way for it, since it's pretty far up north Scottsdale. When I went, it was close to 9pm and the whole area was super dark."}
{"text":"This place tucked in the NW end of Scottsdale has great environment.  The portion is very French but it is what the essence of the true Japanese cooking should be.  The Uni (Sea Urchin) was very fresh almost as good as the fresh catch ones that served from the shell but I know that is impossible but the chef served it on large clam shell to imitate it as best as possible with a bed of ice with ginger and wasabi as garnishes.  The Korean chef really had made an great effort on presentation which is pretty rare here in the Valley.  $18 for uni is a little pricy but it is well worth it.  The eel was served in a rice bowl which I thought was a little different since most were served in the bento bowl.  It is slightly overseasoned but this is how most Korean likes it.  I totally understand.  It was overall a great lunch and service was very attentive."}
{"text":"The sushi was fantastic and the service was awesome! The place is a bit too green, which is ironic because it wasn't expensive at all. Would definitely come back if we were staying in town any longer."}
{"text":"I'm not super into sushi but this place rocks. Don't go here for a birthday, though. We told the sushi chef & waitress that it was my husband's birthday and they didn't do a single thing. A small gesture would have been nice. Great service. Modern, clean ambiance with a nice sushi bar & regular bar. Small place in a strip mall that will surprise you with its cool vibe. Delicious miso soup. My husband loved the poke poke roll with Dorito chip crumble & the lobster roll (I didn't try the former and the latter was tasty, but too rich for me). Good California roll. Good sake selection."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of asian cuisine (sushi in particular), I was very excited to try Nori. I had heard great things, but the actual experience was far better than I had anticipated. The service was superb - each employee was kind and helpful and personable. The ambience was wonderful - sort of a modern asian/fusion vibe.. and the music was a nice touch.

Now for the food - What makes a good sushi restaurant is freshness and flavor, and boy did Nori deliver. The fish was delicious and fresh, and all of the ingredients used in the Spicy Tuna and Philadelphia rolls I had were fresh, flavorful, and well made.

I also had one of the special rolls - sushi that was deep fried and presented with a nice drizzling of sauces around the plate. I often get frustrated at fried sushi that is too greasy, or that has been overdone... but this was perfect. Crispy, flavorful, and beautiful to look at.
Prices were good considering what you were getting, and the quality of food is high.

Since moving to Arizona last summer I have been searching for \"that\" sushi restaurant, and THANK YOU Nori for being just that. I WILL be back."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMY experience and Sushi that is fresh and hits the spot.   Washed down with a couple bottles of Hot Saki.  Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"The quality of the fish was outstanding and prepared with great skill at the knife.  Wonderful, attentive service.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The wait staff is incredibly attentive and professional.  A little pricey but the food quality/customer service is well worth it. My family was treated very well and that always makes me a happy customer."}
{"text":"This place is near my house, but I hadn't tried it until recently.  It's got a nondescript location in a supermarket based strip mall. But it turns out the sushi/sashimi is really high quality and the selection from the main menu is also fantastic.  I usually sit outside in the garden, which has music,a waterfall feature and lots of bamboo trees (at least that's what I think they are). It's very relaxing.  Service has always been pretty good to excellent.  But again, the selling point for me is the quality of the sushi.  The prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, every time I've been there, the place is almost empty.  Not sure why, or how they stay in business.  So TRY IT! I'd hate to lose another of the very few (if any) really good restaurants near my home. I'd give it 5 stars for the sushi!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. We had the Las Vegas roll, crunchy roll, and Poke Poki roll. The first two were apart of the happy hour menu. They were all amazing. The atmosphere was calm, clean, and nice decor. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but the prices were a little higher than I am used to.  The employees were nice, but there are other places with a more energetic atmosphere and sushi dining experience."}
