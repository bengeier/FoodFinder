{"text":"Being in the Stoughton area for a hike, we decided to try Bella Roma.  It was an interesting experience, as there were both nice surprises and disappointments.  We were seated right away on a Saturday night even though the restaurant was pretty busy.  We placed our drink order, with my son ordering milk.  The waiter was kind enough to offer up chocolate milk which of course any 4 year old would say yes.  After it arrived, my son said it was not chocolate milk and in fact, it was just white milk with only a tiny bit of syrup mixed in.    After ordering our entrees and also side salads, we waited for some bread to arrive.  Soon, our salads, which were fresh mixed greens, arrived drenched with the vinaigrette dressing which is the only option.  After eating the salad, we admire the olive oil on the table and wonder when the bread arrives.  Shortly after, our food arrives.  The pollo parmigiana was good but nothing special for $12.  Also ordered was the nightly special of shrimp scampi, which consisted of 5 smallish shrimp and pasta for $15.  On a more positive note, our son ordered a $4 cheese pizza from the kids menu.  We expected a 4\" pizza but instead, a homemade 8\" thin crust pizza showed up.  It was very tasty too.    The biggest disappointment was the lack of bread provided with dinner.  I can't remember going to an Italian restaurant and not being provided with either fresh bread or breadsticks.  Next time in the area, we plan to stop by again to give it another try due to the kids pizza which was a great deal, good service, and the nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Bella Roma tonight was outstanding. Very affordable prices for wine and food. We started off our meal with a salad. We split the Bocconcini salad for $5.95. This set the mood. The salad was full of mixed fresh greens, not iceberg, but real fresh greens. They added diced fresh mozzarella cheese. Yes that is correct, FRESH mozzarella cheese! They also had cheery tomatoes and basil. For a dressing they used lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. It was delicious! Very light, fresh and very tasty. The red wine was only $3.50 a glass, that is a deal in today's market. For dinner we enjoyed a pizza. They have both 16\" (Medium) and 20\" (Large) pizzas. We choose a Medium (16\") Marghetia pizza ($12.95), that included tomato sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil. We added sauage for $.75. The crust was nice and light, not too thin and not too thick for our taste. Not a lot of sauce, just enough, and that was fine with us. The waitress had us try their bread with our salad and that was very good. The bread would work well with extra virgin olive oil or to wipe your pasta bowl after eating all the pasta. Speaking of pasta, we will be back to try their pasta and dinner entrees. Pasta is $8.95 for a large bowl, your choice of pasta and sauce. From what we observed, the pasta dinner was generous and good (the table next to us cleaned their bowls). The dinner entrees are a nice selection of Italian favorites, including steak, chicken and veal dishes. Overall, the dinning experience was outstanding and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am between 3 and 4 stars for this restaurant. The food is good but uncreative, the restaurant is very clean, the staff friendly and service was good. My first visit was four stars but my second visit wasn't as good. My dish sat under the warming lights way too long and the pizza was soggy with grease in the middle. We'll go back again but not too soon."}
{"text":"Being not a huge fan of Italian food, Bella Roma was a trip of curiosity outside of the normal realm of Mexican cuisine offered by El Rio Grande. Bella Roma occupies where Marsalas last was and it keeps the same great building. It had been a while since I have been to Marsalas there and cannot quite remember what has changed or not but it looks great inside.   I ordered an Eggplant Parmesan which is one of my favorite dishes from the cuisine. I declined on getting a salad so I cannot comment on the quality of it but it did look good. Homemade bread was given as a free appetizer with 2 types of olive oil to dip in. One of the kinds had a bit of a kick(well, not really, but I could detect some spice.) Being a big fan of bread/olive oil, I definitely appreciated this.  Their menu was fairly extensive and surprisingly cheap for what I expect of most Italian sit-down restaurants. I ordered a glass of Black Opal red wine which I believe was around $3.50-$4.50. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was great. I have had Eggplant Parmesan before that was soaked in oil but this stuff was pretty balanced. If I go again, I'll definitely explore other menu options. They had a very interesting \"build your pasta\" type concept where you could choose the noodle and sauce and there was a lot of choices for both with whole wheat options as well. It is VERY possible to eat here under $10 , especially if you got a pasta dish and soda/water."}
