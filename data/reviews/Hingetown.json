{"text":"I love Hingetown. It's such a cool little area.  I think it is SO important for local investors to lift up pockets of our fair city. Hingetown is legit one of my favorite places. It used to be a neglected area, but now some of my favorite businesses in Cleveland are here: Urban Orchid, Young Kings Record Shop, Cleveland Tea Revival, Rising Star Coffee, Harness Cycle, Beet Jar Juicebar, SPACES Art Gallery, the CMA Transformer Station... so much more. It's called Hingetown because while it is part of Ohio City in Cleveland, it is at the hinge of Gordon Square Arts District, the Market District, and the Warehouse District.  Really guys. There are some cool businesses on this street. All local, all lovely, all ran by outstanding humans, and all relatively inexpensive. If I need to go spend an afternoon working, Hingetown is a fast, easy win for me. Its also fabulous people watching. The environment itself is a lovely, walkable street with easy parking and fun public art. There's ever changing murals throughout the area and a perfectly manicured living wall outside of Cleveland Tea Revival in the spring. In the summer, there are tables and chairs set up outside of must businesses, as well as a garage door style patio outside of Rising Star Coffee. People ride their bikes, walk their dogs and enjoy the sunlight. Hingetown has my heart."}
{"text":"BAHAHAHAHAHAH!  I cant believe someone named this part of Cleveland, \"Hingetown\".   Just cuz some white suburbanites move here, go to a few city planning meetings, put up a sweat yoga studio and a bunch of new bars with one word titles doesnt make this a new neighborhood.   I wanna see you tell Mrs. Jenkins up the block that her neighborhood is now called \"Hingetown\".  You sound like a twat...stop it.  What next?  The area on Hough between E. 71 and E. 79 is gonna be called \"Puddinville\".  Yeah, lets do Puddinville...I like puddin..."}
{"text":"A very,very cool little area! Hingetown's Jukebox is one of my favorite bars in CLE, sporting a roomy patio, exceptional drinks/victuals, and an exciting concept wherein diners receive tokens for songs on the good ol' juke with each drink. The juke is loaded with a mixture of classic favorites (90's hip hop is far from underrepresented), but the offerings lean more toward a modern sound with plenty of the new school indie darlings. It is like listening to my own spotify playlist while I drink at a bar--who wouldn't like that? Beyond the Juke, Hingetown has some other cool businesses to check out. Rising Star Coffee Roasters is right down the road and they serve some of the best coffee I've ever tasted. The Rufus Dean House of Fun has many fun oddities that I won't reveal here for fear of ruining any surprises. Overall, Hingetown is a hidden gem in Cleveland, and absolutely worth a look."}
{"text":"There are a couple cool businesses here. I go to some of them. I don't like calling it Hingetown. It never used to be called Hingetown until about a year ago. It feels unnatural for me to call it that. I guess that is how the Native Americans felt when they turned this land into the United States of America. This area was once Cleveland's Gaytown. It was anchored by Bounce. Other notable establishments were the Tool Shed and Man's World."}
