{"text":"I tried it because it had good reviews and I want to add my vote. I only have first tried it since I'm from out of town but it was really good. The food was fresh. The service fast and very friendly. The prices very reasonable. I will be back on this trip to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Love it! We r lucky enough to live close.  The gyro is so big you have to eat half of the meat in order to pick it up.  My family loves the baklava. One piece of this pastry is enough for 2 people  definitely will go again"}
{"text":"I went there to get a pastrami sandwich b/c of the Van G. post.....and YES ! it does melt in your mouth,,,,,and yes it is SUPER good ! you guys gotta try this place"}
{"text":"Finally, Medina has a great deli, restaurant, and carry-out that is second to none.  
Slyman's have always been my gold standard.  But move over Slyman's!  Fresh food Deli produces a corned beef and Rubin sandwich that equals Slyman's at a great price.   Their breakfast menu for pick-up or sit down is good too.  I liked the  Pita scrambler (2 farm fresh eggs on hot pita, topped with tomato, onions, green peppers, and your choice of meat).  The have a large selection too numerous to mention.   Their baklave is great too."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Always fresh and delicious. Great prices. Their Greek coffee is the best! Take the time and stop in. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Gyros are great and fresh cut fries are amazing. Large portions and always fresh. Stop by and give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in right before closing.  We ordered gyros to go, and we we received great advice on how to make them at home.  The food was fantastic, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. Owner was great, food awesome...a high quality deli. The portions are really big. Instead of junk food on the road ,stop and support small and local. You'll be glad you did. So happy we found this."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly a really good place to eat.  I yelped a list of restaurants at the Medina exit off of I71 to stop at on the way north.  We didn't want fast food so this seemed like a good option.  The building doesn't stand out as a great place, but the food was amazing.  Gyro, salad and desserts were the best Greek food I've had! The service was great too!"}
{"text":"I grew up not liking Greek food. After coming here I understand I just didn't have proper Greek food. This place is a real gem. The food is absolutely incredible. It could easily be an anchor restaurant in any major metro area. If you are anywhere near this place you have to stop."}
{"text":"Got the Grandslam Sandwich. It was big enough for two people to share. Can't say enough about how good the meat was. It melted in your mouth"}
{"text":"We were a lil nervous when we walked in, but the food was AMAZING.  The best rueben I've ever had. Best lunch I've had in years."}
{"text":"Crossing Ohio I stumbled across this place. It's amazing! Best Greek and deli food ever! The meat was tender and flavored delicately with herbs, the pita bread soft & fresh, the vegetables fresh & perfect. The waiter was the owners son and he was warm and charming and funny. Great baklava and almost as good as my Armenian mother-in-law's (which was as close to perfect as could be). And my daughter got some great college advice to beat!"}
{"text":"They just moved right next door to where I work, tried it for the First time today. Perfect food, and the service was excellent. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Grabbed a couple of Gyro platters to go for the fam. Wow, best gyros I've ever had since moving down to Wadsworth 10 years ago! Meat was cooked perfectly, serving size was huge and the price was good. Can't wait to try the corned beef and patrami, but if you are looking for a good gyro, you HAVE to try Fresh Food Deli Really, REALLY good.Service was freindly and fun too."}
{"text":"Very friendly, fresh food. The service was a little slow. but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best gyro ever!! My husband and I went here today for the first time after reading all the good reviews and we were happy we did. We will be back!! The owner is a lovely man :) such an enjoyable quick lunch today."}
{"text":"Ok this is a very pleasant surprise.  This place was totally shocker on how great it is. Owner is extremely nice and food was awesome.  Don't let the look of place scare you away it's great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly owners!  I always get the fried eggplant salad, and my husband always gets the gyro, which is too big to even pick up.  He loves it so much he hasn't tried anything else on the menu yet, though we plan to. Hopefully they stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"I ordered the pastrami club sandwich. Terrific sandwich!  Pastrami had a lot of flavor and the hand cut fries were tasty. I'll definitely stop back."}
{"text":"Can't argue with anything written in other reviews. Food was plentiful, fresh, delicious. Restaurant is certainly bare bones, nothing fancy. But best food I've had in the 5 mile radius on my frequent business travels to the area. Very reasonably priced. And the owner is super friendly and genuine. Good place to support."}
{"text":"this place is a great place for take out and to dine in. They are a true family owned greek restaurant. If your in the mood for a gyro or a corn beef sandwich its crazy good and you are def not leaving hungry. It is very well priced. Everyone should give it a try for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! In town for a couple days and noticed this little place out in front of my hotel. Checked the reviews and was excited to see what people were saying. They were spot on! The gyro was one of the best I have ever had! And by far the most filling. Had to weigh in at over a pound. Also had an excellent greek salad. Might have to extend my trip so I can try something else tomorrow!"}
{"text":"My entire family goes here all the time, because they have the best gyros we've ever had. And they're huge!"}
{"text":"We were very excited after seeing all the great reviews to give this place a shot. Showed up on a Sat night about 6pm with 3 adults and 2 kids.  1st knock is no kids meal or pricing. Second knock is it's seems like there were only 2 people working; owner and a cook. When we arrived there were 2 tables checking out and no one else in the restaurant. The owner say us and was very pleasant. Got our drinks promptly. We ordered our food. My wife got the gyro, I got a burger as did the 3rd adult. 3rd knock is my son wanted a plain cheese burger with ketchup. It came loaded with all the fixings and swiss cheese. He never asked what kind of cheese and they had options. So of course my 7 yr was grossed out by the stuff he doesn't like on his burger. The owner saw this and made no attempt to appologize or offer to fix it somehow.

The biggest knock was how slow the service was. It took us almost 45 min to get our food. And by the time we ordered he had a total of 3 tables. It's hard to keep a 2 yr old still for 45 min....esp at dinner time. 

When the food arrived itcame out in stages. Burgers, almost 5 mins later our fries followed by another 3-4 min gap of my potato salad.

That being said the food was good. But it's not family friendly at all. And to take 45 mins for 3 burgers and a gyro is crazy. 

Giving 2 stars because the food was good once we got it"}
{"text":"I had the most pleasant experience here today !!!!

I wanted to try their gyro meat... so I got the gyro salad. Presentation was spot on. All though I really wish it had more meat than what it did. I now know to get the platter next time since I do Keto and skip the salad. Lol. 

The owner was very sweet and helpful talking \"shop\" with me. And his son, was a gem too. 
I will definitely be back to talk again. I enjoyed that the most I think :)) 
Nice, family run operation who has a passion for their craft--- just how it's supposed to be.  
Very clean and simple. Gotta give this business your support!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good stuff. They do a great job in the kitchen. I knock off a star for the decor/interior/signage needing a make over. Also, I hate getting plastic cups for drinks. Especially old looking ones. Glasses, way better. It's an old Mexican place and it is kind of weird inside. 

But the sandwich and the gyro we got was top notch. I think if they had a better location and the outside/inside were better, this is the kind of place that would have a line consistently."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional. We had he pastrami and corned beef and it was delicious. The gentleman, who brought us our food, was so nice."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious it was my first time here.I would recommend it to anybody and the server will make you have a laugh or two.They also have a big selection of food that anybody would find good."}
{"text":"Outside is bates motel...with a motel behind it...no shit. AC leaks on tables.  Water spot visible on each. Bad location check. Took several minutes for owner to appear check. Ok 30 seconds and it was weird. Uncomfotable stares between me and wife, check. Nobody but us here. CHECK. Do not let on to the kids. Hmm. Should be packing today maybe?  Then sweet, possibly greek owner comes out. Confused. CHECK. Hmm.  Leave now I glance at my wife who would get us killed at charades? We are early diners. Kids. You know. After he realizes we are not trying to convert him or something it is 5....ok 4 star treatment. Disappears in back after telling us to pick a table.  Slowwwwwwwwww service.  Heard mad veggie chopping and dish clashing after order. To be fair signs say call ahead. It is a deli.  Well. Not too shaby, man. 2 lbs of gyro meat, pita, veg, a beer, and a decent but not toasted and hot Reuben with 0.75 lbs of good corned beef later...and sadly limp fries as an after thought later and I am out around 40 bucks with tip and left overs.  Kids happy, wife sad at cool Reuben and Dad glad. Quirky but worth a second shot. To owner...make gyro meat cheaper at deli counter. Cheaper to order same amount of meat with platter that includes pita, sauce, and veg. Hot Reuben!Will stop again when in the area. Would put several restaurants out of business I think eslewhere, but does not look like it gets a lot of traffic here. Check it out. Save a small business with good food, low prices and some character."}
{"text":"I stopped at this restaurant on the way home from vacation and it was an excellent choice.  

The food was fresh and full of flavor!  I got the Mediterranean gyro and fries and my friend got the pastrami sandwich.  The portions were huge! Enough to take leftovers.  

The server/owner was very nice and takes pride in serving fresh flavor food."}
{"text":"The food represents the  name, everything from the salads to the pitas are super FRESH and delicious. Definitely recommend ordering ahead if you are in a rush. The portion sizes are huge so you more than likely will need a to go box. They offer alcohol, seasonal specials and sauces made from scratch. Definitely would recommend the veggie pita for $5."}
{"text":"Just passing through town, but thought I'd give this place a try, and I'm so glad I did!  Hands down beat hot pastrami on rye sandwich I've even had - and I've had a lot!  Tasted like they smoked the pastrami in house, but they don't - comes from a supplier in Chicago (go figure). The flavor was amazing, and it was too peppery.  They even toasted the bread.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way to Cuyahoga National Park to grab sandwiches. Owner was great! We loved the sandwiches and pasta salad. Would highly recommend. Will stop on future trips thru this area."}
{"text":"They have the best food in Medina.  All the sandwiches are the greatest. Even the mustard is interesting."}
{"text":"Father and son have been open about a year.  It is hard to get to, approximately across from the antique mall but worth the effort!  

They are doing a lot of stuff excellently - nice atmosphere, ciabotta bread, good tomato, great lettuce, big and tasty pickle spears, fresh deli turkey, great Rueben, soda is a good vintage - you know what I mean!, great cut on the fries.  Hershey's ice cream. Party Platters.

Things I would like to see - mayo, chips, bacon.  As I suggested to the son, walmart.com ships free for orders over $50.  You could get the variety packs of chips and Duke's mayo (from the south and oh so tasty!).  

Maybe try your hand at homemade chips because those fries are delish!

I'd change the name of the Turkey Club to Mile High Turkey if you aren't going to have mayo, bacon and ham on it.

We drove 40 miles to look at RV's and we are glad we decided to come to Fresh Deli!  We'll stop by again, if we get over that way."}
{"text":"My new go to in Medina for a great sandwich! The pastrami is outstanding! Can't wait to try the gyros!"}
{"text":"The Venetian Chicken was the most tender flavorful chicken I had in ages! Pita, vegetables, and Greek sauce were all fresh and tasty. Good food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Just beginning to explore this place's menu, but what we have had so far was A+++.  Not just quantity - you can find plenty of that around here -- but also awesome quality.  Loved it.  Great gyros!!!"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. I ordered corned beef on rye with Swiss, hubby ordered pastrami on rye with Swiss we thought we'd trade halves. Not happening way too good. Huge portion, he ate his whole pastrami, I ate half CB for lunch and then dinner. Will def go back as they have so much to offer. So want to try gyro.

Went for takeout a second time, wanted to get something different but ended up with the same hubby got pastrami which he swears is the best. I changed from the regular corned beef sandwich to the Reuben. Really delicious except I thought the sourkraut  should have been rinsed more as it was a bit to salty for me. Will def be back soon.

Went today and got the ultimate gyro platter. It was excellent. So much food we will be grazing off this for days!"}
{"text":"This was amazing.  It's fairly unimpressive from the outside,  but the food is delicious.  Huge portions,  very reasonable.  The owner waited on us and was very nice.  Have to try the gyro. Delicious."}
{"text":"I really want to give 5 stars but there were a couple of things...

First was the fried eggplant. Maybe a little overdone but definitely very greasy. I suspect that the fryer was not hot enough. 

Second was the chicken noodle soup. It had nice big chunks of chicken but I don't believe the broth to be home made. Tasted like instant packaged stuff or bouillon. And the noodles over cooked and fell apart. 

I had the gyro platter. WOW! Seriously a whole pound of tasty meat with fresh chopped veggies. Great pita and sauce. Wife had reuben sandwich with tremendous amount of corned beef. Both of us could (should) only eat half of the servings. Father-in-law had Greek sausage sauteed with vegetables. Much more sensible portion size. 

Prices are great. $10 for my gyro platter that was good for two meals. 

Owner very nice and attentive. There were four of us. He took our orders and repeated back without writing any of it down. Good for him!

Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Weird vibe. At noon on a Friday, did not see any employees to assist. Very little food in the deli display. I left to go look for something else."}
{"text":"Wow...the pastrami sandwich melted in my mouth,  the meat was so fresh!  Nothing to look at inside or out, but the food was great.   Came here only because of the reviews---Had to see/taste for myself.  I'm from out of town and now wish we had one of these in Minnesota.  I'd be here all the time.    How am I going to get back here to try the corned beef?"}
{"text":"Got the Reuben but added pastrami for carry out and it was the best one I had in a while.. started out putting 3 stars because the inside decor wasn't very sit down friendly. But the pastrami and corned beef were top notch flavor wise and shaved super thin. Will try carry out again soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh Food Deli is a jewel. Great food. Terrific value."}
{"text":"Man I'm so happy I discovered this place.  The same owners used to run the \"Original Greek Gyro\" in Cuyahoga Falls and I was very sad when that closed.  I went a year without a decent Gyro.  We were in Medina on some errands and looked to Yelp for a lunch idea and this place had the ratings to draw us in.  As soon as I got inside I recognized the faces, the food, and the decor.

Order the Gyro, it's the best one I've ever had in my life.  I get the platter because it's like three Gyros in one big plate.

Everything there is fresh made, fresh cut, and made with love and care.

I'm so happy I accidentally re-discovered one of my favorite places to eat that I thought was gone forever."}
{"text":"We've been going here since it opened, Great  Greek food and deli sandwiches, try the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) too they're delish."}
{"text":"I found Fresh Food Deli on Trip advisor.  The reviews were great, and I love Greek food.  We went on Sunday, but they close at 3.  We went back on Tuesday evening.  There were two people waiting for carry-out, and a table of four.  We sat at a booth and were greeted by Demetrius, the owner's son.  He is personable, but doesn't overstay when it is time to eat.  I ordered the Gyro Platter, because I wanted leftovers.  It was enormous.  I could not even eat half the of it.  The meat was delicious, and not overcooked, which happens too often at other restaurants.  There was a grilled pita underneath, and another was cut into wedges around the platter.  The platter was garnished simply with diced tomatoes, onions, and fresh parsley.  Tzatziki sauce was served on the side.  This was a serious platter of meat, unencumbered by lettuce.  My partner had a wonderful corned beef sandwich piled high on rye bread with brown mustard and delicious pickle spears on the side.  I tried to finish my platter tonight, but there is still enough left for another light meal.  If you like Greek Food, or deli food, you really should eat here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The gyros are always very good. The kids now ask for gyros after eating here. The desert is also great."}
{"text":"I was greeted and waited on by Yianne, who I'm guessing is the owner, but I've been wrong once or twice in my life.  His service was impeccable, and the food was delicious. I ordered a classic gyro, which could have easily fed 2 people, and 3 if they weren't super hungry. The meat was phenomenal, the grilled pita bread was some of the softest and most delicious I've ever had, the tzatziki sauce was flavorful, and the tomatoes and onions topped it off perfectly. I took off at least 1/3 of the meat before I started eating to save for later, and ate the rest with a fork and knife because it was too big to pick up. Every single bite was a pleasure. I also ordered a side of fries, which I could have done without due to the size of the sandwich. However, I think they're fresh-cut in house, and they are thick, cooked perfectly so they're soft on the inside, and are lightly sprinkled with herbs and salt. I suggest ordering the combination plate with the smaller-sized gyro with a side of fries (or soup or salad) unless you're sharing. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. 
     We will be in town periodically for Irish dance practices, and I will definitely return. If I lived near here, it would be Yianne's service (and the food!) that would keep me coming back. I watched and listened as he treated guest after guest like family, welcoming them in and serving them attentively. He is personable and a wonderful conversationalist who listens. My only suggestion for improvement would be to set the temperature a few degrees higher. It was quite chilly inside and I was thankful I had a thick sweater under my jacket. Then again, I'm almost always cold."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch while driving north. It was awesome! Definitely way better then any of the fast food options on that exit. I ordered the pastrami and swiss on rye. It was the best pastrami I've had in a very long time. Sliced thin and piled high with a ton of swiss. The rye bread was really good as well, it was thicker cut so it held up to the nearly pound of meat and cheese that was on the sandwich. The girlfriend had the gyro, which was basically a fork and knife sandwich, it was huge. The gyro meat was really delicious and juicy. My only complain, and its a small one, is that the food took a while to come out, which we didn't expect since there was only one other table. But the food was hot and freshly made so I'm not complaining a lot."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick take out order while driving through Ohio. It's easy to find from the high way and super easy to get back on. 

I ordered a Gyro and it was one of the best I have ever eaten. It was a straight pound of food. In fact after a couple bites I had to stop eating the pita because I'd rather finish all the yummy meat and veggies inside. I also grabbed a piece of baklava which was enjoyed much later and was great! 

My order came out fast too. Granted I stopped for a very late lunch. Also the gentleman who helped me was charming. 

I will be back the next time I'm driving through and need a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Friendly service, incredibly cheap and large portions, and absolutely delicious. Will be going back again tomorrow, my new favorite place to eat in Medina."}
{"text":"Great gyros and owner was so nice when I picked up to go order. The prices are fantastic.  Must try the French fries!"}
{"text":"First visit and food was OUTSTANDING. We had the gyro and the Flavors were great and the owner was very helpful and knowledgeable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"THE BEST!! The owner is wonderful and his Son is too.  The food is incredible and Yani will take orders and make you the best food ever!!  I am Greek and this is just like my YaYa's cooking!!  Huge portions, great food, great service!!"}
{"text":"This deli was awesome!  Everything is hand made to order. Three of us had burgers that were great, and our other co-worker had the Grand Slam.  It was so good, he ate the whole thing. 

Because everything is made to order, the service is very slow.  No problem, it is worth it. They do offer order ahead service."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for lunch while traveling as it is right off the highway. I was thankful for something other than fast food. The gyro meat was probably the best I've ever had and it was a sizable portion. Excellent, friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Great pastrami.  As an ex New Yorker I'm picky about pastrami. This was the best in a very long while. The owner is very friendly.  Don't be put off by the outside appearance. The food is great."}
{"text":"Great service and food.     Picked this place from Yelp and glad we chose it.

The Reuben sandwich was the best I have had.      Big helping of meat.     

The chicken gyro was great.  
Everything was so fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food... one of the best Gyro's I have had in a long time! Yani, the owner was so personable and very helpful! I had heard great things about this little \"store \" and it did not disappoint! My BF had the burger special and was equally impressed... the fries were fresh cut! 
I can't wait to go back and try the Rueben!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled...this place looks like a whole in the wall, but a local recommendation and it's high abundance of 5 star reviews on Google and Yelp drew me in. Another determining factor was it's extremely close proximity to the Quality Inn I was staying at directly behind it. Prices are reasonable and serving size was excellent. The XL original gyro was excellent with its side of yogurt sauce. Tasted fresh and had great service too."}
{"text":"Idk what to say! The reviews do the talking here. I'd definitely give them an 8 out of 5 stars. The staff and owner were so nice and hospitable. I ordered the gyro platter and it did not disappoint. For $11 we had a very filling dinner(the wife and I)and lunch for the next day. The gyro meat was so thick and cooked perfectly. Will definitely be going back soon. The outside and decor look a little cheesy but never judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"yo this the spot . and the prices are legit. the food is good. idk what more u could want? the owner is nice and recognized me and remebered what i ordered the first time i went. he even referenced some conversation we previously had. go eat. i went everyday while i was in medina/cleveland/akron  working.  nut rolls are legit."}
{"text":"Rare to find a restaurant that doesn't use bag lettuce and frozen burgers. This is THE place for fresh. Burgers are fresh sirloin not ground beef. Yum. Salads are made for you. Homemade dressings with a Greek flavor. Generous portions served by welcoming owners. Restaurant is on south side of of Medina Road so if you come from from the east you need to do a U-Turn at the light to find it. The Greek pastries are the bonus!"}
{"text":"really good place enjoyed the gyro and homemade fries will definately be back brought home dessert and the family loved it will be imterested how rest of menu is"}
{"text":"Don't judge this book by its cover! Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is absolutely worth it!!! Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We were craving a \"big deli sandwich\". Found this on Yelp and gave it a try. Not super quick service because of a rash of large take-out orders ahead of us, but SO worth the wait! We shared dolmades, a big salad and a Grand Slam . . . the quintessential \"big deli sandwich\"! All the meats were luscious. The owner was fun to talk to - informative and personable. We will absolutely eat there again, and I plan to make this my corned beef and pastrami headquarters from now on!"}
{"text":"Arby's says they \"have the meat\" but this place actually does.  I had a great Ruben sandwich that was overflowing with really good, tender corned beef on proper rye bread.  

Skip the chains & give this a try."}
{"text":"Owner was very nice and Friendly service - family atmosphere. Food was fantastic- Gyro is great - would recommend anything here to try - nice to have a family business in the area of 71"}
{"text":"Best gyro in town and fabulous tzatziki sauce! The owner and his son are absolute GEMS!"}
{"text":"Good food great value! I love the Gyro! Great for take out too. The pastries are very good too. 
I've been Now about a half a dozen times and the quality is always the same. The owner is always there and he is very proud of his food and it shows. 

Enjoy and come hungry!"}
{"text":"Don't let the look fool you. Looks like a dive outside, cases inside look pretty sparse but this is not a counter deli like you might be expecting. Food is fantastic and the father/son owners are great. Gyro is amazing, baklava is out of this world, rueben is heaven. My big problem is choosing - it's all fabulous."}
{"text":"This is great find and super close to the highway, which makes it even better. Authentic Greek food :)"}
