{"text":"Though I couldn't find any reviews on the Lofty Cup Cake since the Lofty Lunch Box is the same deal I thought I should let everyone know what happened to me on my wedding day. I chose the lofty cup cake because they were the cheapest around and when I tasted their cup cakes they were really good. My husband and I chose specific ones for our wedding day. When I got to the reception hall I noticed right away that the ribbon that they provided to go around the stand was falling off showing the particle board in every picture that was taken of my cup cake stand.   We were told that we were going to have cup cake boxes so people could take home cup cakes and I would have a topper box, their were no boxes!  It was getting close to cleaning up time and they still had not came for the cup cake stand so my mother disassembled the stand and later on two teenagers from what they looked like came and didn't speak to me or talk to me and (I had no idea who they were) took the stand that I put a 100 dollar deposit on. Later on we packed up the cup cakes in tin containers that the dinner caterer had left for us. The tin containers were not made for cup cakes so my topper got damaged.  Later on, the next day we were eating the left overs at my parents house and friends and family came, we notice that most of the cup cakes that were left over were not the CUP CAKES WE HAD ORDERED. In fact some of them were really screwed up white cake raspberry filling with mint icing yuck! And almost all of them where Apple flavored. I don't even like apple filled anything. We were highly irrotated because we paid close to 450 dollars and we didn't get what we ordered.  I believe that the Lofty Cup Cake is very disorganized because I had conversed with them almost a dozen times through email about how I wanted my cupcakes to look like and which flavors.I feel they did not fulfill that. We also did not receive the proper receipts and documentation of anything that we purchased or we would receive it through the mail a week later.  I also wrote them an email telling them how dissatisfied I was with how they did things and have never received a response back, It has also been 2 weeks and I have also not got a follow up call or email asking me how things went. I believe they knew they messed up and are not avoiding me!  I would not chose them to do a wedding and I would not recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Every changing cupcake menu alongside a daily lunch menu in a former drive through coffee shop.  I used to come here weekly when it was a latte shop last year... but I don't get to this side of Tallmadge much these days and noticed there was a new store in this building when we stumbled on The Daily Bread next door.  The website has a pdf listing of what the 2 daily lunch specials and 1 side will be for each day of the current month... I wish I hadn't JUST picked up some General Tso's at a Chinese place before stopping or I would go back tomorrow when it will be the special... the Loaded Grilled Cheese (with salami or turkey) sounds fun... I definitely plan on coming back for a lunch soon...   Cupcake Review  There is a dry erase board next to the drive up window that lists flavors, but it wasn't up to date so the owner listed all of the flavors she had available... which seemed like more than 10... but it was difficult to keep track so I ordered the standards... something chocolate... red velvet... and I caught the word caramel as I tried to absorb the list.  The Facebook page lists coffee as an option, but there wasn't a menu for flavors so I stuck with just the cupcakes this time around.  Overall I didn't like the balance of frosting to cake... not that there was icing piled high... but it was REALLY thick... and the cake REALLY light...   Death by Chocolate - for the true chocolate lover... fudge frosting... a more liquid chocolate filling, and a devil's food cake... but the cake was way too light in structure for my taste... it was plenty \"chocolaty\" enough... but it was hard to keep it from crumbling around such thick frosting.  Caramel Apple - The website says the frosting is caramel... but we only tasted vanilla... the apple pie filling was nice with a hint of cinnamon, but the frosting was really thick and the cake really light.  Red Eye - Espresso frosting with Red Velvet cake... nice balance between the thickness of the frosting and the soft moist cake... easily my favorite.  The frosting wasn't too coffee tasking... the non-coffee drinking hubby loved it.  I would try the cupcakes again... BUT... I will bring my own container... the plastic cups were really hard to get the cupcakes out of... we had to place them in the refrigerator for almost an hour so the frosting could set up and the cake became firm enough to lift them out of the cups with 2 steak knives... I tried it with the cupcakes at room temperature and the cake caved in and the cupcake wouldn't lift.... if the cakes themselves weren't so tasty... it would have been a 2 star deduction for the frustration and loss of frosting... but they were really good!"}
{"text":"The lofty lunchbox and lofty cupcake is the newest hidden gem in town! From the fun and different lunch options available to the AMAZING cupcakes, I promise you'll be impressed!   The lofty cupcake made cupcakes for my wedding over a year ago and people are still talking about them. There are SO many unique flavors it was hard to choose, but with many \"wedding options\" my guests and I were more than pleased! The owner, Leslie, did all the set up and everything looked exactly like I wanted it, she pays attention to every detail. I've since bought cupcakes for bday parties, baby showers, etc. and will continue to order from here as I've honestly never had a bad cupcake.  Tallmadge needs a place like this & everyone should check it out whether it's for a quick sandwich at the lunchbox or to order a dozen cupcakes for your next event."}
