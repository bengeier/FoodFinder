{"text":"Delicious food, far out staff, and a great experience all around! Came here the night it opened and I was super excited to finally have amazing pizza 5 minutes from my home. Tony's Slice House did not disappoint! I had a slice of pepperoni and it was heavenly. Steaming hot, ooey, gooey cheese and perfectly crispy pepperoni on insanely good crust...what more could a girl ask for? 

I see a few people complaining about the price, but I felt it was very reasonable for a casino food court. Yes, a slice is about $6, but it's huge! I have yet to finish one without the help of my always-hungry boyfriend. Aside from it being a large slice, it is also the best quality slice of pizza that I have found in Henderson. It is only about a dollar more per slice than Sbarro (which is what used to be in this location), but the quality is undoubtedly superior at Tony's. 

I love that there isn't only pizza on the menu here, but also salads and subs (maybe just one sub? I can't remember exactly). I haven't tried any yet, but I like that I have the option to get a salad with my slice or a sandwich instead of pizza. They also sell a few beers, which I believe is unique to GVR's food court and just plain awesome. Who doesn't like pizza and beer? I do think a bigger selection of beer would be nice though as there were only 3 when I went. 

Overall I really loved Tony's Slice House. Ricky, Victor, and Leo were all friendly and gave my group exceptional service. I have a feeling this is going to be a regular lunch spot for me!"}
{"text":"The first few times I had slices of pizza from this place the pizza was fresh, service was friendly. Now it's the complete opposite, the convict behind the counter was a grumpy Gus. My last two visits the pizza's were swarming with gnats!!!! I can't believe the health department hasn't been called in. I had to eat panda where the food is gnat free!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe some of these reviews. This is definitely the best pizza this side of the Mississippi and I'm including California in this. They have got the sauce recipe just right not too much oregano, the crust is perfection not too soggy or too thick, maybe they import the water from New York. The toppings on the slices always seem top notch. Also the people serving are always really nice. The only thing that bugs me about this place is that there isn't a location closer to me since I moved away from Henderson. Please move to Red Rock Casino, our family loves you."}
{"text":"Consistency plaques this place. I have now eaten here 4 times and I will not try this place again until they get this corrected. I had a \"great\" cheese slice the day after they opened and have not had a good slice since (lack of cheese, burnt slice, and overall dull stale flavor - like it sat there for days). I've also tried the meatball sub and it has been inconsistent. First of all it's a bit on the skimpy side in my opinion. The first time it was very tasty; second time awful (did not finish); third time: it was very good (not skimpy on the third attempt).

In my conversations with other people, most have a similar opinion and a few had a slightly better experience. The full service restaurant will open in a few days and I hope management will give that place more attention to the restaurant food quality."}
{"text":"This place is supposed to be the quick and easy version of Pizza Rock. The only things they had in common were the outrageous prices and uppity attitudes of the staff. 

Pros:
The plain cheese and pepperoni slices were okay

The ceasar salad was decent 

Cons:
The Stromboli was raw! I mean like raw, uncooked dough in the middle and burnt crust on the outside. We asked them to put it back in the oven and the guy was visibly annoyed. He put it in the oven for a few minutes but when we got home, still raw. Stick with the basics and don't order the Stromboli.

Who knows how long the pizza has been sitting there!

The salad was $8 for a small portion!

The slices are $4.50!

All in all, not the best experience. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  If it wasn't for the bartender, wine, TV's & ambience at Pizza Rock, I'd say this is my favorite, the best, even better for strictly the pizza cause the PR menu is larger & has a nice variety (FYI under the same ownership)

Besides that it's by the slice..
-I love the Grandma Slice omg!  The peppadews, sauce & dough all fit together like out of this universe!  I wish I could eat more, but have even split one slice it's so huge!  It's way too big for me to get a whole pie so the slice is actually perfect.  (Not on PR Menu)
-You can try many unique slices & make a whole unique pie of your own.  Like BYOP lol.  Hey, they should add that!  
-The Picante is one of my favs, but one whole pie gets to be way too hot & spicy for me.  The Slice House makes it w/ ricotta so it cuts that heat w/ a alil sweet.  If you do order a whole pie at PR, add the ricotta cause it doesn't come on that Picante.  Mmm!

Pizza Rock told me that I could bring the slice back there to eat so I will do that next time.  All of the pizzas are great & super good like at the restaurant.  I have eaten at both numerous times & the consistency is on point.  I do wish that one of the two would bring back the square Detroit Green.  It was to die for!"}
{"text":"I was sooo excited to try this new place at Green Valley Casino. I heard that the restaurant was called Pizza Rock and the quick serve was Tony's Slice House. I wasn't super hungry so I thought we would try the Slice House and save the Pizza Rock for another night.

Sadly, it fell short of my expectations. I am actually glad that I tried the quick serve place before the restaurant because I would have been really ticked if I had to pay triple the money for a whole pizza that was majorly salty at best. I ordered a Sicilian sliced pepperoni, sausage and onion slice. I asked for it to be heated and well done. It was heated, not as well done as I had asked. I would have sent it back to the oven, but I know that is a health code violation so I just dealt with it as I didn't want to waste food. First bite, holy biting into a block of salt. I am not sure if maybe it was because the pizza wasn't hot enough, maybe the amount of meat, cheese and thick crust all together had too much salt cumulatively or if someone dumped salt on the pizza itself. I ate 1/4 of the slice, because I couldn't take the salt anymore. I was drinking water with my meal and that is probably why I was able to eat that much in the first place. 

I also ordered the side salad with Gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts. Great salad, too much dressing dumped in. It would have been better on the side so perhaps I could have gaged the dressing. 

The price for these two items came out at $9.95 which is reasonable. They do have some good specials like a slice of pizza and a beer for $8.00. They sell wings, meatballs and garlic bread among other things. So good variety. 

The employees were very upbeat, happy and great at suggestive selling. It's just too bad the product they are selling didn't live up to the hype. I am pretty forgiving and will eventually try this place one more time to see if my experience is different. New places need time to work out kinks and modify recipes but it would seem to me that an award winning chef should have this done before the doors open. 

I will make sure to update my review if my next visit is different. For now 2.0 -2.5 for this one at best. Sorry guys, when a place makes me wish I should have ordered Fatburger or go to the casino cafe, that says a lot. 

To improve, I suggest always asking if the customer wants dressing on the side, when re-heating the pizza, check to see if the pizza looks fresh like it came out of the oven. The cheese on my pizza was not even melted when I got it, this could be a potential food poisoning opportunity if not heated properly. Also, please check out why my pizza was this salty. I have never experienced this before on any pizza I have ever had, even ones loaded with more meats than this one was. Good Luck."}
{"text":"My husband raves about tony! So I needed to visit his new pizza place in the food court. The meatballs are AMAZING!!! The lasagna is really good and the pizza is very good. Nothing less from the 11th time pizza champion"}
{"text":"Didn't want to sit down at Pizza Rock so tried Tony's slice house as a quick alternative. Pizza Rock is really good (downtown location) so I assumed Tony's was the same. It was, but the only guy there was the worst. He gave attitude as we were deciding on our 2 slices...then again when we got a drink...to the one person in front of us...and again when we were paying. 

We literally went there to just take 2 slices to go. We were not expecting any extraordinary service but we didn't do anything to get that attitude. 

I get it...he doesn't want to be there. Thanks for taking it out on the customers. 

1 star for the one slice. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have higher hopes for a place with Tony's name on it, but this counter failed to measure up to even an average mall food court. First visit got me a greasy pepperoni slice served with some of the rudest service. Was it a misguided attempt to add to the authenticity of the NYC experience? Don't know, didn't like it, or the slice.

Returned to try their $6 slice of the day, said to be a featured specialty pie. Phone calls to get info were unanswered, arrived to a basic pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza. Opted instead for the CA Veggie slice ($5.50), which was happily packed with veggies but marred by a half-cooked crust that was so soggy my fingers sank through in places. Award-winning pies? I think not."}
{"text":"Love love this pizza tastes so good!!! Wish it wasn't $23 for a whole pie though  staff is friendly, pizza is made fast! Love the sauce! They should make chicken parmesan"}
{"text":"The Pizza here is excellent!! Large slice that may leave you wanting more. The prices are a little on the high side but if that doesnt bother you youre in for some delicious Pizza options"}
{"text":"This pizza place just became a top spot in Vegas on my list! Great slices under $4!! Brittany was a great hostess Definetly coming back. Best Pizza in Henderson"}
{"text":"The cheese will please! The sauce is boss! The crust is a must! Ruben was the awesome gentleman running the shop like a well oiled machine and serving piping hot slices of goodness.  

Located next to Fat Burger in the Food Court. Easily the best choice there considering both price and flavor. They serve real pizza, no gluten free nonsense calling itself pizza. High gluten flour is a key ingredient in pizza making! You goofs can find another spot. This spot is for pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"This place is sullying the name of Tony Gemignani. I got excited to hear that Slice House is open and not too far from my house. For me, there is two places I go to for pizza in this town, Pizza Rock and Grimaldi's. Since the owner of PR owns this place...I'm expecting the same high quality product as his other establishments, but that's not the case with Slice House. The only thing they have in common is the ridiculous price for one slice of pizza. 

No one should ever have to pay $4.25 for one basic slice of cheese pizza. It's just wrong. I refrained from writing about this place until I gave it two visits. I'll start with the workers. For some odd reason, the main guy at the counter... seems to always have to go in the back for something. It's like he does it after every customer. The guy making the pizzas takes forever. I would be fine with that if he was putting out a quality product. The pizza looked so bad Saturday night that I had to ask him if there was anymore fresh ones coming out of the oven, since the ones in front of me were just too burnt, or looked like they been sitting there for hours. I decided to wait for a new pie. I order one cheese slice. The pizza is improperly cut, so the slice is more round that triangular. He then puts it back in the oven...and guess where he heads after?? To the back! By the time he comes back out, he forgets about my slice, I have to ask for it...and now I have a $4.25 slice of burnt bread (barely any cheese on it). 

This place is trash. Pizza looks and tastes like crap. Get it together Tony. Quality control is needed."}
{"text":"A little bit better than Sbarro or Villa Pizza, but only a little bit. The ingredients used are quality, and the slices handed out are larger than average, but it's a ho-hum and doughy crust with air bubbles a plenty (both slices ordered, different kinds of pizza, had air bubbles)."}
{"text":"Give 3 stars for the  newer guy.. wears his hat backward ( would have given less but the 2 other guys are so nice!) . Zero personality.. poor customer service .. and just a bad attitude for whatever reason .. trying to shoot the breeze with him so it's not just this exchanging of good and money but he had no desire to give me even just a few words.. ha and forget a smile ..pretty sure he hasn't smiled in years ( guessing obviously)
Thank you Ruben .. your the constant over there and he ( Ruben)truly thrives to make the customer feel welcome and satisfied. So five stars for you mad.. and like - 1 for  homie in the hat"}
{"text":"The pizza was okay but not as good as the owners other restaurant downtown.   The sauce was to thick and sweet for pizza.   I thought the pizza would be the same but obviously they use different ingredients at this place.  If you ever get a chance try the pizza at the downtown location....YUM!"}
{"text":"If you've been to one overpriced food court pizzeria you've been to them all. 

Tony's is a newly opened pizza spot in the GVR food court and it definitely does not seek to impress. Selection is pretty standard, cheese, pepperoni, veggie and a few specialties pies. Portions are pretty big but at around $6 for a slice its pretty pricey. Add on a $3 drink and by the time you are done eating you realize you should have gone to Pizza Hut. 

Pizza while not bad is not overly impressive. Thin crust with some tomato sauce slopped on and some generic toppings. Meh. Service was pretty friendly but certainly didn't make up for the mediocre pizza served. Nothing really to see here guys move along."}
{"text":"I don't know what that guy was smoking in that 1 star review complaining about the workers, etc. you say he's always going in the back as if you're stalking the place watching what he is always doing? And you're bitching about the price of a slice it's pretty much the same the Villa pizza charged before but this is real pizza, with real pepperoni, good sausage......only children order cheese pizza or cheapskates, the have a veggie slice if that's your excuse

So your experience sucked well, I've been there five times GvR is a  home away from home, and the real pep, the size and quality of the slice, the Amazing square-Sicilian pieces are awesome. I've been to Pepes and Sollys in New Haven Connecticut I've been to pizzeria Due in Chicago I've had pizza New York City and I will say for a food court this is as good as it gets. Oh and I didn't mention the lasagna which I ordered the last two times, huge portion for nine bucks an amazing quality top 5-10 lasagna I ever ate

Can't wait for pizza rock to actually open up this is just a teaser and good for a quick bite"}
{"text":"For 5 bucks a slice.... decent taste but waaaayyyy tooooo overpriced....next time I will just starve n hold my appetite!!"}
{"text":"Headed down to Green Valley Ranch today for lunch. 

Heard Tony the Great opened his new Slicehouse.

Couldn't wait to try it. 

Didn't see Tony making any pies. 

Not only was it expensive...$6.00 for a slice plus $3.00 for a drink (no refills), but it was overcooked, dried out, cold and old.  

Bummer!

I was expecting so much more!

I give it a generous 3 stars because it really wasn't bad Pizza, just not good. 

I will probably try one more time to be sure it wasn't just a bad day. 

Hope springs eternal..."}
{"text":"Boy I tell yuh what. Slice house is 5 min from my residence and they keep me well hydrated and fed on the regular. Now they have a special $8 for 1 of any beer and one of any slice. A well balanced meal deal. Now all the cheapos can stop whining and start drinking. If you have any questions about the slices or unique ingredients ask the manager there Ryan P. (same name, different guy) he knows his pies."}
{"text":"Had slices of cheese pizza on 12/18/2017.  Very disappointed.  Slightly burned and tasted like it had been made the day before.  Three stars instead of two becasue we have eaten here before and the pizza was good."}
{"text":"Next time help me and I'll keep it nice. Was waiting for the guy who seen me walk across the counter space. While standing there he doesn't acknowledge me but he looked at me so yup I just was looking at the pizza and seen this little homey claiming his part of the slice. . -3 stars for bugs in case w pizza. -1 star for no service when the worker seen me."}
{"text":"I visited Slice House with my 91 year old grandmother. Ray, the manager, was so kind and went over the entire menu with us. He helped my grandmother find the perfect pizza. Thank you Ray for the amazing service and fabulous pizza!! P.S. the honey walnut & Gorgonzola salad was wonderful!"}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would. They were serving inedible burnt pizza  and got attitude when I sent it back. I would never come back here. Also, the food is all overpriced. The wings are extremely tiny, you only get six and it's eight dollars. Paying all this money to starve. The pizza is nothing special. I'm highly dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
New York Slice with Pepperoni
Sicilian Grandma Slice with Teardrop Tomatoes and Fresh Basil

Following the lead of Dom Demarco's new slice shop in the Caesars' Food Court with a celebrity chef of their own, Green Valley Ranch launched \"Tony's Slice House\" to coincide with the opening of the second Pizza Rock location and although early word of mouth and better judgment certainly gave me pause I simply couldn't help but take a taste for myself...the results far worse than I'd ever thought possible, and not at an insubstantial cost.

Purportedly featuring the works of Tony Gemignani, the eleven-time award winning pizzaiolo whose multiple ovens and unique pies have been making believers of folks visiting Downtown Las Vegas ever since the original Pizza Rock opened up shop, it was just after 1:30pm that I approached the long counter and ignored for a good five minutes as the lone employee milled about aimlessly I admittedly nearly walked away, his eventual greeting of \"what can I getcha,\" answered by inquiry about the freshness of several options and an order eventually settling on two slices billed at a steep $9.75.

Obviously requiring a quick trip to the oven as not a single pizza was proclaimed as less than 45 minutes old it was perhaps three minutes that I waited after paying the bill and soon porting the two paper plates as far away from nearby smokers and slot machines as possible a quick fold and first bite told all the story one should need, a slick of pepperoni grease quickly coating both plate and forearm while the flavor was not one bit superior to Sbarro, let alone any number of Manhattan haunts charging 1/4 the price.

Taking one more bite of the flimsy slice before discarding the rest in disgust it was onward to the Grandma Slice that the tasting progressed and, although nowhere near as oily, the minimal oven time left the thick square merely luke-warm as half-melted cheese of average quality melded with thankfully robust sauce and basil while teardrop tomatoes dislodged at each bite and simply fell to the table, no aspect of this Sicilian nearly as impressive as that of Cugino's or Montesano's regardless of branding, pedigree, or 'major award.'

Certainly not as 'wowed' by Pizza Rock as many others, and generally annoyed by New Yorkers who cite the 'slice' is some sort of landmark dish, it should go without saying that I approached Tony's Slice House without substantial expectations and yet somehow the Celebrity Chef money grab underperformed them all, the combination of shoddy service, subpar ingredients, a smoky casino, and high prices making this place one of the worst dining experiences found in Las Vegas thus far."}
{"text":"When I 1st noticed this pizza spot, I didnt realize it was IN the GVR casino so was kinda bummed about that, but I happen to be in there 1 day and was hungry so I decided to give it try.

I got a slice of pepperoni and a soda. Kinda pricey,  but thats what ya get when you get food in a casino rather in an outside business. Unfortunately,  I didnt think the pizza was all that good either. Didnt really like the crust plus I dont like the small pepperoni that they use. Definitely not a typical NY style pizza. The crust was too thick and kinda hard. 

 but luckily being that its in a casino its not a place I would frequent anyways"}
{"text":"The Sicilian grandmother's Slice Pizza $5.25 was very good. It has fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, garlic, oregano, romano and basil on the thick Sicilian crust. It was very good."}
{"text":"I can not believe that the individual shops 3 Stars.
I shop here in the pizza eating until now is special.
Please by all means eat everyone. Be sure to satisfy."}
