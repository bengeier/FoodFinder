{"text":"Saw many great reviews and decided to try it today. Ordered take out and when I arrived 40 minutes later (the time I was told) I waited another 20 minutes to get my order. Butter chicken was bland and luke warm, naan was unsalted, biryani was cold and tasted like lemon juice was poured all over it.  Will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The menu flexes to suit your taste(within reason) everything was delicious. Biriyani is to die for."}
{"text":"The owner is from India and he really knows his Indian dishes. I tried the curried lamb and was left in awe .. amazing flavour and tender .. his Biryani was amazing and his homemade pepper paste is incredible .. he will prepare almost any dish to order as he is a professional chef, amazing .. the business is only 4 months new so his prices are very low at this point for the quality/quantity he's providing .. I'll let him earn his five stars as I plan to eat hear once a week"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for weeks and was finally able to try it today! I can't believe there aren't more reviews and raves about this joint because it has some of the best Indian/Indian fusion/Chinese food I have ever tasted. Some of my favorite dishes were the butter chicken, beef curry, chicken biryani, Hakka noodles, and fish biryani. For a place with a variety of specialties they do it very well as the food has great flavors and taste. The prices are extremely decent and the portion sizes are big.   The interiors are modern and extremely clean. Especially the washrooms were spotless. The environment is a comfortable home feeling and you will feel just as home as the staff are always accommodating.   The owners are very nice and humble people who are always there to make your experience pleasant and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some South Asian cusinies, take out and catering. I know where I am getting my next event catered from! The food is mouth watering and delicious."}
{"text":"First time , place looked sketchy , but it's actual amazing food and friendly people."}
{"text":"This location has been a rotating grab bag of small places over the past few years. I'm so glad it's now occupied by SS. The decor is very sparse, but the food is amazing, and the portions are very generous. I had the chicken biryani, the chicken curry, Chana masala, beef kabobs, naan and samosas. Everything was delicious and well spiced, and the owner was very friendly and helpful when I wasn't sure what I should get. The 2+ person combos offer a great variety for a great price, when most Indian places force you to get a single dish at dinner prices. Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time , was recommended by a friend . Really good food ! I would highly recommend the fish biryani, something that you rarely see . I paired that with some beef curry and it was amazing ! Tried some Haleem from my buddy's bowl, defiantly getting my own next time ."}
{"text":"The uncle running this place is very friendly.   They have only been in business for about 5 months. The naan is a big size. I am happy with it. My friend really like the butter chicken.  The ginger chicken did not have any Ginger taste at all. And the fried rice simply did not have taste. I would recommend the Chef to taste their food before providing it the customers."}
{"text":"The man we've seen running this place has always been really nice the few times me and my friend went in! Plus points for hospitality :)  Their shawarma isn't amazing or anything, but at $5 each (when we went in), it was a great deal! The biriyani was pretty good as well, although we ordered the one with boneless chicken and accidentally got a couple bones in there...   All in all this place is seemingly the only decent Indian food we have in the area, so I don't mind popping in now and again when the South Asian cravings hit!"}
