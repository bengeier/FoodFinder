{"text":"Ate here based on a suggestion. Waitress was friendly but when asked what she recommends, she spoke really quickly and we didn't understand any of what she recommended. 

Food was very yummy but very small servings - I guess that's tapas for you! 

Cucumber Mist cocktail was great. 

Fantastic view. Best to request a window seat or even a table on the patio. Sat by the window and we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined here on April 20th. It had only been open to the public for about a week and I must say everything was amazing. We were seated right away for our reservations even though the place was very busy. The restaurant is very bright, not your typical Vegas dining so we were kind of caught off guard by that. But nonetheless, it is gorgeous inside with a beautiful, contemporary feel that has an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. They do recommended 3-4 plates per person but I think that is kind of a lot for two females. We had the bruschetta, margarita pizza, red wine risotto, lamb ragu pasta and the filet with Gorgonzola cheese. By the time the filet came out we were already so full. We didn't have anything to drink since we were going out right after but some of the neighboring tables' cocktails looked amazing. Our bill came out to be around $80 which we thought was pretty cheap with the quality of food. Everything tasted amazing and I cannot wait to come back again. The lamb ragu pasta is a must! Probably one of the best pastas I have had. Also, the margarita pizza was amazing too.  The service was awesome too. I'm very happy Bellagio added this new restaurant and I think it will be doing great there!"}
{"text":"Amazing view and brunch was delicious, duck polenta was marvelously very tasteful!!!! Thank you Albert and Julian for an amazing brunch. BUT you can't beat the chocolate fountains"}
{"text":"I was in town from Columbus, Ohio when some friends and I stopped into Lago for happy hour. I was over all extremely pleased with my visit. There was an excellent wine selection and 3$ craft drafts. Once we had a couple drinks we decided to order some appetizers. My personal favorite was the calamari. The service was excellent. Becca was attentive and made sure we were having a good time. 

I will definitely return to this location next time I am in the area. Happy hour with friends was fun, but I could also see it being a great date spot for wine and a romantic dinner.  Great location, great atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"You cannot beat this location! So beautiful! Denise, Jenn and Matthew (the som) were awesome! You have to get the carpaccio and if they have the artichoke special you have to get it!"}
{"text":"Came here with several friends for some good food.  It is very loud here we could not talk across the table. The food is good quality but very small plates of it.  We were disappointed and felt rushed by our server."}
{"text":"Good food and nice service. Rich flavors and a great patio atmosphere. I'm from chicago and this was on point with what I am used to."}
{"text":"Lobster Gnocchi. OMG this dish was out of this world amazing. I'v never tasted such good Gnocchi. Meatballs and calamari were also good. Just can't say enough about the Gnocchi lol."}
{"text":"I was here for a work conference and had a hosted dinner here. The ambiance is amazing particularly if you can get on the veranda and dine outdoors with a view of the fountain. I was so disappointed in the food we were served. We were served three starters: a bruschetta that was delightful, a flatbread that was ok and a scallop sashimi that was fine. Next course was two kinds of risotto - both were bland and undercooked. Next we were served three meat dishes: a steak and potatoes dish - meat was under seasoned as well, meatballs - which looked fantastic, but alas were not seasoned well, and a white fish - not bad. I did not get to see a menu or order my own food, so I don't know if dining off the menu would have been different, but I was severely underwhelmed by what we did get. It is Such a beautiful location and my dining expectations were not met. The 6 other people I was sitting nearest also felt the same."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Vegas! Amazing food, drinks, service, and views! I love the Princess drink."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE! The food was horrible. The steaks were all overcooked, and the ravioli tasted like it was straight from a can! The best thing there was the Fiji water that was charged without our consent. The service was horrible. IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE! Aside from the overpriced food, DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ARE NOT WHITE! We had a party of 14, and the only person they approached was our \"white\" friend. They were not attentive whatsoever, and we were seated smack in the middle! I was there to celebrate my 30th birthday with my family & friends, and I honestly regret bringing them to Lago. Never again! I've had better service at McDonald's! Oh, and I'm only giving 1 star because there's no negative stars."}
{"text":"On a recent weekend trip to Cleveland, I chose Lago as my dining destination to celebrate my anniversary with my dining partner. Overall, I was pleased with my experience. It started off a bit slow, I don't know what was going on with the wait staff that evening but it seemed everyone was having very slow service and the restaurant wasn't even full. Maybe they were understaffed? Any issues with the speed of service were made up for with the food. Everything was absolutely delicious. My dining partner had the gnocchi and just as everyone else on here has said it was phenomenal! I decided to get one of the specials that evening, lobster ravioli with a filet on top. Mine was delicious as well. We had the mussels and clams as an appetizer which was good but nothing out of the ordinary. And for dessert we enjoyed the goat cheese creme brûlée which was very tasty. Overall I give this place 4 stars based on the food. Hopefully others will have slightly speedier service!"}
{"text":"The gentlemen in the front with the hostesses was rude. I had made my reservation the night prior. When I arrived, I requested for a table near the window for a bday. The guy mocked me. I was surprised by his lack of professionalism. I understand it's not a guarantee and I would be fine if you're unable to fulfill the request. There was no need for him to mock a guest that is about to dine at the restaurant. His action had made me decide to leave and dine elsewhere. What a shame! I still can't believe this happened at a Julian Serrano's restaurant."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 30th birthday here with 8 friends. It was my first time at Lago. Food and drinks were great, but service was very poor. I called and spoke with the manager, Aubrey, the next day about the experience. The service recovery was phenomenal! She took the time to write a letter apologizing and sent a gift card to come back for a better experience. She definitely made it right!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Once with family and once for work and both times I have been disappointed. They are really missing the mark when it comes to seasoning. Their meat has been cooked perfectly, bit had zero taste."}
{"text":"I had dinner here a couple of times and I would have to say that I've yet to be overly impressed with the food. Everything has been sorta \"meh.\"  The service is absolutely great, and the wine list is also very good but dinner has felt very anticlimactic. 

In addition, is it just me or does the decor in the restaurant  cross the border from classy into cheesy? I mean, I realize what they are trying to do but the painted brick/landscape....really? Feels a bit Olive Garden-y to me. 

I may be up for trying it one more time, but honestly, with so many better options in Tremont the odds aren't looking so good..."}
{"text":"We went for brunch, highly recommend it if you are there, it is really nice. The food was great, fabulous  view of the fountain show. We were staying there for our 25th anniversary. The staff was very pleasant. Our waiter was very attentive,  gave use nice little dessert plate with happy 25th anniversary written in chocolate. They have a great drink deal to go along with the prefix brunch menu if you choose, we did not. My hubby and I had the breakfast burger which we both agree was delish as was  the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to blow me away but I was pleasantly impressed with my experience here
Highly recommend the caprese salad as an appetiser
Pistachio-crusted salmon entrée was an 8/10
Highlight - one of the best espresso martinis on the strip  Just a slight wait on beverages but as is expected on a Friday evening
Excellent service & friendly staff all around"}
{"text":"Please keep in mind while reading this that many of the 4 and 5 star reviews on Yelp are by people who were provided a free meal and gift card for the opening of this restaurant (marked Elite'15)...

Perhaps this restaurant isn't meant to be geared towards a medium sized group in their 30's. The room we wound up in was an odd L shape with our table wedged in the corner like a bad afterthought. In order for one person to get out the entire side of the table had to get up. Our server kept insisting the best idea was to order a bunch of items and that the table share them to get to try everything. That concept doesn't really work here since some items are just 1-2 pieces of food.  How do you share one scallop with the table?  The better idea is to stick with getting 2-3 plates per person.  I like the small plates concept and chose several other restaurants during my visit to Vegas that used it and seemed to execute it better.

The food was prepared well and the flavors were good - but that's just it - it was only \"good\".  Not great, not amazing... just good.  With the total bill the size it was, I expect more than \"good\".  It certainly wasn't innovative with the flavors and menu items. There are certainly better options on the strip for the same prices with better menus, experience, and flavor.  You probably have a local place serving modern Italian and doing it better than Lago is, so skip this while in Vegas.

The bar/lounge area was the nicest part of the restaurant, but with a large group, their iPad menu made drink ordering extremely slow since they only had one to give us for 6 people.  Staff was friendly and attentive and worked so well together it was hard to believe this place opened only a few weeks ago!"}
{"text":"Yes the view is nice, but the food is outrageously overpriced for the miniature portion you are served. It was comical. If the food was amazing it may have been ok, but it wasn't. The 6 mini raviolis were cold, the two pieces of bruschetta were not up to par. Not sure how they have any repeat business. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Lago for Restaurant Week 2016.  The \"Week\" menu was a great offering of the menu items.  We arrived early and gathered at the bar for a drink.  Instead, we bought a bottle of wine as it was more economical.  The bartender, Christopher, was fabulous.  Gold star for Christopher!  He let us taste a couple of different wines before we bought our bottle.  We chatted with Christopher for a bit and then wandered to our table.

I was not terribly impressed with our service after we left Christopher.  While the we were there early, and there were lots of wait staff milling about, it was an ordeal to get a basket of bread.  It was also an ordeal to get a second bottle of wine.  However, amazingly when it was time to pay, staff were readily available -- a personal pet peeve of mine!   

Our first course of the five course \"Week\" offering came immediately.  However, there was a huge time gap to get our second course.  We were NEVER given clean eating utensils between courses, which I found strange given this is a upscale, pricey establishment.  Another irritating issue was there was no clear path to move around in the restaurant.  Excusing oneself to use the restroom was like playing the game Operation in that I hoped to not knock somebody's arm, purse, table or plate of food.  The tables were close together and in a random set up.  

With that being said, the FOOD was FABULOUS.  It was all very tasty with unusual offerings.  I cannot complain about a single offering.  Each person in my group picked a different offering, and we shared the plates around the table.  I can confidently say that there was not a disappointed person in the group.  THE FOOD MADE UP FOR THE OTHER SHORTCOMINGS.

Finally, let me take this minute to vent about the MGM properties (Bellagio) and the new pay to park policy.  it is bull crap!  I had to wait in a line to get off the Strip into the parking garage, and while I am a local, I still resent that fact that the MGM thinks I need to pay to spend money in their properties.  Each member in my group spend over $150 per person to dine.  What an insult to think at some point we will also have to spend an additional $10 per car to dine.  Quite frankly, if this day arrives, I will not be frequenting Lago's or other fine dining establishments in MGM properties, or if I do, it will be few and far between!   I hope the restaurants who are owned by outside companies take note of this issue and do something about it!"}
{"text":"Lago is a must-go! The ambiance of this place alone is enough to keep me coming back. That in addition to superb service and exceptional food makes this one of my favorite dining options on the strip. I walked in and was greeted by two very friendly hostesses. I was meeting friends and as soon as I sat down a server handed me a menu and asked for my drink order. I had a mimosa which was made perfectly and garnished with beautiful sugar work and a glitter dusted raspberry. My server was so patient with me even though I changed my order and was very indecisive. I started with the ahi and then I had the eggplant parmesan benny. Definitely order the Benedict, it was to die for! I finished off with the desert tastings. I have to say I felt like an un-attended minor at a birthday party because I had no self control and had a little bit of everything! I loved that there was such a variety so it was good for everyone in our group. From fresh fruit to a chocolate fountain, they had it all. My personal favorites were the crepes and the fruit tarts. 
Overall, would definitely recommend. Perfect for a girls outing or a cute date. This place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with three friends. Each of us enjoyed our meals immensely along with the hip atmosphere. We began with the meatballs as an appetizer. Wonderful! Just like my Italian mother's recipe. The warm bread served is also a great sign about the restaurant. Often restaurants throw down a cold basket of Orlando bread. Not at Lagos - attention to detail; thank you very much.  I ordered the veal tortellini with Parmesan sauce. For a cream based sauce, it was not heavy or overdone with a heavy hand. The tortellini is handmade and quite delicious with the ground veal. Mixed into the dish were peas. Just superb. Overall, all of us thoroughly enjoyed our dinners. Nice wine list. I had a Sangiovese blend recommended by the waiter - very lovely.

We went on a Friday night. Around 10 pm, they had a DJ that played very hip club style music. The place transforms into more of a club until closing. Nice bar area inside and out with a patio area. 

I highly recommend this restaurant if you enjoy Italian food. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience! Make sure to get a table near the fountain and enjoy the view during the water show at night.

The risotto with red wine is out of this world. So is the octopus and the gnocchi. Everything was incredibly good. One of the best restaurants I've ever been."}
{"text":"Ambiance is excellent and would be even better if it was for dinner with the water show. Panini was not what I have expected with the Focaccia bread and doesn't have much taste. 

The veal piccata, branzino, salmon salad and salmon carpaccio was good. Service was always very nice."}
{"text":"Service was horrible' didn't take our drink order and food was mediocre at best.nor worth the money or time!!"}
{"text":"The food was quality, staff and their service fantastic & atmosphere was cool.
The scallops were to die for! The cavatelli was amazing! Finally a great addition to our downtown scene!"}
{"text":"The patio is awesome. We were there in December and it was not too cold. The food did not blow me away. I've eaten at Julian Serrano at Aria and liked the food there a lot more. 3 stars is too low, but 4 stars would be too high for the unexciting food. I tried the Caesar,  Gnocchi, meatballs, and  the seafood risotto. Maybe I'll go back and try some other dishes. I did like the Sicilian gin and tonic."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great wine list, great view!

Our servers volunteered to pick our dishes for us based on popularity and our wine selection.

The somm was very knowledgeable and recommended a Tuscan white.

One of our servers (Frank) was also a certified somm and nailed the pairings.

Favorites were branzini, agnoloti, fusilli with lamb ragout, filet mignon with gorgonzola and the chocolate cake."}
{"text":"We were at Lago restaurant yesterday evening (11 August 2016). This restaurant and the views were amazing. The staff was very kind and very friendly. The dinner was fantastic. The restaurant is expensive, but the quality was very, very high. It is worth to go. The quantity of the food is not big. Then, if you love to eat until to bursting, don't go. But, if you can afford, you will not be regretted. Indulge yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Fine Italian high class. Small plate portions. The view alone was worth the price of the meal."}
{"text":"We loved Lago! Had a seat right at the windows overlooking the fountain. The food was amazing. We had pizza, which was so incredibly good. We also loved the risotto and the filet. All great!"}
{"text":"We had the quaglia saltimbocca, nduja, caraofi & granch, risotto frutti,cannelloni, and fusillioro. Most everything was fantastic, particularly the cannelloni. Will go back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite in Vegas! Best location, best view of the Bellagio fountain if you can get window seat. Staffs are friendly and welcoming. 
We ordered Margherita, spaghetti chitarra (clams in garlic sauce), polpette di carne (meatball) and tiramisu at the end. It was all so delicious! Margherita is a small pizza for appetizer and really light. Both spaghettis are small portions compared to other restaurant yet the quality is very good. Tiramisu is yummy! I will  go back again for sure."}
{"text":"This is my worst experience I ever had. Service was so Pathetic. The waitress misunderstood all the time what we ordered. It was 3 times that went wrong, either the dish came in cold version or it was a totally different dish. 3rd dish we returned. We wanted a seating with view, when we got, it was too cold to take. Finally the table what we got had minimal view. Overall, it felt people(waiters) were rushing and crowding the place. I don't expect food to be great always(which wasn't), however the service was extremely horrible for such a high ended place. We wanted to give the best experience for the bride to be, which went in vain :("}
{"text":"We celebrated a 60th Birthday here this past weekend with friends who had not yet been to Lago.  The service was amazing (as always) our waitress was so kind and attentive as well as all of the staff that helps out!  Our friends loved everything about the restaurant and we were so glad since it is one of our favorite restaurants!  Nicole and Fabio are amazing at creating a great menu with awesome food and great atmosphere whether its a dinner for two or group get together!   Love it here!"}
{"text":"Went to Lagos on a friday night and were seated right away.  The food was decent, the waitress was helpful. but the service was slow."}
{"text":"For an Italian restaurant, pastas are too cooked to start with. That is the first no no.
Then the chicken was dry, the veal scallops too salty.
The only dish i like was the little pizza, otherwise i will never go back there.
Julian Serrano should stick to the Spanish tapas food (the one in Aria)"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but nothing stood out and the flavours did not really convince. For the steep price and tiny portions we expected more. The service was good overall although we felt a bit rushed at times. 
This would have been a 3 star review, but it will only be 2 stars because the manager behaved incredibly patronizing towards us when we asked for the (rather expensive) red wine not to be served extremely chilled, but at a normal drinkable temperature. Arguing with your customers, telling them to \"google it\" (which we did and google agreed with us for the record) and that they are wrong and have no idea is simply rude and terrible customer service and ruined the whole meal. 
It was a shame because the location of the restaurant is great and the view is stunning and as said above the service overall was very friendly and efficient. 
The quality of a restaurant is always noticeable in the little things and Lago showed tonight that it really isn't more than an wannabe gourmet restaurant that cannot deliver what it promises."}
{"text":"just simply not impressed. we have better food in our tiny po dunk town back home. meatballs were prepared by Chef boyardi 7 and 7 was bland. risotto was ok. and the pizza was a joke. you get 2 stars for having a great staff and killer view, which is clearly what the price tag was for. sorry guy."}
{"text":"Food was okay - 3/5. Service was terrible - we had a reservation and requested a view of the fountains twice before we showed up. Got there early and were quoted different wait times by three different people. One hour later we were finally seated and everything seemed to be an imposition on the staff. 

At least the view of the fountains was nice!"}
{"text":"They were rude seating our group of 12 women, rude taking our orders and rude about splitting the bill up.  Way over priced and did not feel the need to be polite as they automatically put 20% tip on the bill. They acted like they thought they were 5 star but...RUDE."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant.  When we arrived, we asked to be seated by the window so we could enjoy the bellagio fountain, but was told that this area is reserved for people staying at the Bellagio.  Why?  We pay the same as they do.  We were staying at the Aria.  They should have been honored that we spent money in their Restaurant. instead we were placed several seats away where there was a lot of traffic.  They didnt put alot of thought into the seating arrangement.  People had to squeeze through our table to get through and that was very distracting and annoying.  The servings were very small, but expensive.  $160.00+ later, we were still hungry when we left.  We will not be going back to Lago, and I will be sharing my experience at Lago with my blog followers."}
{"text":"Great location, ambiance. Wine list is good but super pricey. Service was excellent. Food was very good - small plates that can be shared."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place EVER in Vegas! The view is unbeliveable. I've been here for dinner and for Lunch,  have no words to describe how amazing my experience was. Last time we went, our waitress Monique made our lunch even more special, she recommended us to try a Brunello di Montacino and OMG, what a great red wine!     The Patio was full so we got a table by the window. My friend had a Polpo D'avola and a Linguine Frutti Di Mare and I had a Crudo Platter which is a salmon, scalopp and tuna 
We let Monique pick the desert for us since she made so many good recommendations and she brought us a platter with Mattonella, Amalfi and Djoto, it was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this place for either dinner or lunch, for a special ocasion or for just a Sunday brunch with this perfect view! 
Thanks Monique and Albert (GM) for making our experience memorable and special!!!"}
{"text":"I had a superb experience at Lago! The food and the staff were absolutely wonderful!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was very attentive! The ambiance was great also! I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"First off, outside seating is a must! They just started brunch and it's starting to cooling off outside- the perfect setting for their amazing mimosas and complimentary fountain show! One of my new favorite brunch spots, and you will find the value well worth your money. The quinoa salad is the perfect starter, light and refreshing and the dates and blood oranges make the best complement. Next I had the chicken florentine style, a popular choice with so much flavor. My new favorite Sunday brunch, highly suggest."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant. Quality and Nice people around! Staff are friendly. Delicious tapas! But the portions are really small. If you are hungry, you should order pasta :) i saw that ppl like pasta!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, and a really nice setting, however, the food was very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Some dishes are hits and some are misses. Big hit is the octopus dish. Big miss is the $15 margarita small size pizza with burnt basil. Bartenders are very nice and helpful. The mojito drink was boring. The ricotta on focaccoa bread was boring."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Lago with my wife and we were disappointed with the the food.  The atmosphere was great and you can't beat the view sitting on the glass for the water show."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our friends' anniversary on a Saturday evening. The bar and cocktails were good, but the restaurant experience was lacking. One of our party wanted to ask for another server. The servers (not just ours) seemed distracted rather than attentive to their customers, though it wasn't crowded. The food descriptions and reviews sounded great, but 3 of the four dishes we ordered were at best average, certainly nothing special (Angel Hair, Campanelle and Sweet Potato Ravioli). My wife did love her Penne, but not enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Hey you, you little meatball you.
I met a girlfriend a couple of weeks ago at Lago and we sat at the bar.  She had whiskey and I chose a fancy drink with lemonade and honey and I don't know what else. Nor do I care, it was just really good. The bartender was a doll.  Delightful personality, fast on the draw, exactly the type you want behind the bar representing your restaurant. As a matter of fact everyone who worked there couldn't have been more welcoming and pleasant.  I read so many reviews on Yelp where the food is excellent but the attitude of the bartenders, servers, hosts and hostesses (do they still call them that? Am I politically incorrect, like calling a flight attendant a stewardess?) ruins the entire experience.  Here this is not the case.  We got the menu, and I loved that they had full plates and half plates.  We both got the Caesar salad and it was the best I've had in years.  My friend got a couple of meatballs with sauce.  I got the pasta with one meatball.  I never thought a little ball of meat could make me so happy.  It was tasty, the sauce had a little after-kick, and most important to me, I didn't find any surprises. No little hard things, bits of bone, gristle, or whatever else a ball of meat can have to offer.  That was one smooth meatball.  This will be my last review for Lago because I don't want to be a bore.  I'm just going back for more meatballs and that's all I'll ever order in the future.  My tastes are very pedestrian.  I don't like bone marrow, pig face, anything like that.  Just give me a Lago meatball and I'll be very happy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love it here, but there are a lot of other better Italian restaurants on the strip. The staff were great and very attentive as we sat on the patio overlooking the fountain views. The price point didn't live up to the taste of the dishes... I don't mind paying money for good food but Lago you have disappointed us."}
{"text":"This has to be the one of the best if not the best dinner I've had in Vegas. First of all I LOVE tapas style dishes because I get to try it ALL. I came here last year (2016) for my birthday and I was 9mo preggo and believe me I tried it all. The ambiance is gorgeous. We sat outside and saw the fountain water show from the Bellagio. We even saw a proposal happen with the table next to us. Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! What a fun spin on Italian cuisine! It's so nice to leave an Italian meal and not feel so so full. I highly suggest the chicken liver, lamb ragu, scallop crudo and blue cheese gnocchi! 

The atmosphere is modern, cozy, young with lots of energy. If you can, try to get a table near the windows or outside to watch the water show! Best view of the Bellagio fountains."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie & dine all over the Las Vegas Strip Resorts 4-6 times a year, but rarely endorse any restaurants...I also don't like to drop names or status & everyone that knows me knows how humble & generous I am...I even paid for an elderly lady's gelato, at a dessert shop, that night because no one wanted to translate in Spanish & she just wanted one scoop.

Having that said...Management at Lago are a piece of $#!+ (PoS). We made reservations the minute reservations opened over a month ago & physically went there the night of our reservations to request Patio/Fountain outdoor seating...They told us to come back 45mins after our reservation & the outdoor seating was ours. They call us 45mins later & gave us \"highchairs tables\" near the bar...It's Mothers Day Weekend & my Mom is reaching 80yrs old, how do you expect her to climb onto a highchair?!? Management tells me that the whole restaurant is booked & we just gave your seats and 4 other couples' seats to a party of 10 WITHOUT RESERVATIONS because we know large groups are better clients...Really?!? WTF?!? Don't give me a lecture on that type of research & statistics...I drop 10X the average US household income at the Bellagio & Aria every year and I don't have to walk around in large groups.

I feel sorry for the 4 other couple that took whatever crap management gave them...I literally had to argue with them to get a table & get off the high table w/ high chairs.

It was too late to dine elsewhere so we did end up dining there...The food is excellent (took pics of each dish), but so is Picasso at Bellagio Resort & Juslian Serrano at Aria Resort. It is mainly Italian cuisine served tapas style, so expect to order 5 to 7 dishes & one main-course per person. Enjoy the wonderful food, just arrive early to make sure you have room to put up w/ their crap...Or arrive in a large group & hog the restaurant patio WITHOUT a reservation.

Chef Julian Serrano, if you read this I challenge you to fire the manager that was working May 9th & let me (someone like me) take over, for a fraction of his salary...In return I ask for equity on that establishment. I assure you that if you don't put a performance matrix on management, they WILL bring your restaurant down.

Incompetent managers taking advantage of nice people = NO MORE Mr. Nice Guy!!! Definitely NOT coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sunday brunch! Delicious food , cocktails and desserts. They even have a chocolate fountain for desert . Exceptional service by our waitress Monique. I'm definitely coming back with my girls!!"}
{"text":"Good portion and taste. 
You won't find this quality easily.
You should stop by this Restraunt while you in Vegas. 
Hard to book though"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We ask for a table. They tell us we can sit in chairs and order drinks. Then Went outside and saw tables and manager said we could not sit out there unless we were going to order dinner. Still sitting waiting for a server to ask for our order where we were actually told we should sit. Finally get up and leave and they say have a nice night. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing!!! I went for brunch on a Sunday and the egg ravioli is unreal! Mostly all of the dishes were great, but the best part is the variety of the mimosa flavors! HIGHLY recommend for anyone who is looking for a beautiful brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Bitch for a bartender.  Horrible attitude and gave me a beer I did not order and told me to pay for it.  Never treated me or guest with any curtesy.  Never going back"}
{"text":"The food was ok, a little on the overcooked side, the atmosphere was nice... but after being ignored for 10 minutes, the bartender,  after being told by \"another customer\" sitting at the bar to notice the guy who had been sitting there waiting, finally came over. 
So service terrible, food wait times forever, but... I was the bartenders \"buddy\"!  Everyone wants a tip, right? ... would advise all the Aloft patrons to search elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good !

Wow, what a beautiful restaurant.  You walk in and the first thing you see is a modern, double-sided fireplace.  The decor is gorgeous.  Probably, the nicest in town.

I ordered their Mojito and it was the best I've ever had. Smooth and minty without over doing it.  For lunch, I had the SPAGHETTI ALLA CARBONARA (with yummy pancetta bacon and peas) and my friend had the GRILLED TUNA STEAK.  Fabulous !  For dessert, we both had Mitchell's White Chocolate Ice Cream, which tasted just like a white chocolate Easter bunny.  

All in all, a great place to go, and pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"I bit overpriced for the food. We shared plates since it was a bit over budget. What we did share was great! the Calamari was out of this world."}
{"text":"En tourisme à Vegas j'ai eu l'occasion de dîner au Lago. Il y a une vue exceptionnelle sur les fontaines du Bellagio.
Le service est impeccable et le décor très agréable.
Le rapport qualité / prix est honnête, avec une entrée très bonne : la pizza zuchini. Un très bon assortiment de desserts.
Je le recommande bien évidemment."}
{"text":"If you get tables at the end or patio, the view of the Las Vegas Strip is amazing. The prefix for lunch was not badly price. The food quality is good. Didn't give 5 stars because they need to improve the prefix dessert a bit. Next time, will go there during Belagio water show."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food presentation, the ambiance nor the value of this resturante. I  don't think it will be on my list of restaurant recommendations."}
{"text":"This is a ripoff
The dishes are so small that it does not make any sense.
Copious is $18 and the size is one spoon only."}
{"text":"Started with tomato soup and antipasto, had eggplant ravioli, and mango sorbet.  Food was so-so, the waitress who served us had a sulky face the entire time.  And the prices were quite high for its portion and quality.  Would not go back there."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the quality of food. People in our party who ordered entrees were more satisfied than those with tapas. The scallops, branzino, 7&7, and pizza were mediocre at best. Only item that was ok were the short ribs"}
{"text":"Ate here on March 29 , 2017 - made a reservation for 6:45, and luckily secured an amazing seat on the patio.  

Food wise, the restaurant serves most of its portions appetizer size, so you'll probably need to order 3ish dishes per person to get full.  That being said though, the food is utterly excellent.  We ordered the ribs, scallops, rapini, duck, mushrooms, and clams.  The seafood was very fresh, and was, for lack of better terms, really really good.  The ribs were ridiculously tender - how did they do it!?  It also tasted incredible, and the duck was done perfectly as well.  I know rapini and mushrooms are just veggies, but they too were of the highest quality.  The dishes are around the $20 mark each, so it's around the same price as the higher-end buffets if you go with the 3 portions per person formula, but I'd say the quality is definitely a step up, even compared to a place like Bacchanal.  Service was excellent as well - staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and definitely added to a positive experience.

I'd be remiss to finish this review though without talking about the view.  The \"reverse\" view of the fountains, looking out towards Paris, is phenomenal.  I highly recommend getting to Lago a bit before your reservation to try and secure a patio seat - they're given on a first come and first serve basis, and for the most part, can't be reserved (you can make reservations for indoor seating, and getting there before your reservation time gives you a better chance of securing a patio seat in the event that one opens up).  It's hard to hear the music the fountains are dancing to from the patio (you can still make it out, but you have to try), but the spectacle is wonderful regardless.  I've posted a couple of pictures of the view to try and illustrate what it's like, but nothing beats being there.  

What more can I say?  Excellent food, impeccable service, and one of the great (if not the greatest) restaurant views in Vegas - the best meal I had on my trip, and an easy 5/5."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of tapas-style dining lately. I love being able to try a bunch of different dishes. I couldn't wait to eat here as soon as I heard Bellagio was getting a restaurant  like this, and Italian, one of my favorite types of cuisine.

Service was awesome, especially for just opening this month. We got sat promptly with great views of the Bellagio Fountains. Best view on the Strip. Restaurant was lively and energetic. Love it. 

The offerings at Lago were really unique and really good. Our waiter explained to us that we should be ordering 3-4 dishes per person which sounds like a lot, but turned out perfect. Prices ranged from $10 to $20 each plate which is pretty normal for a nice dinner on the Strip when you do the math. The margherita pizza and ricotta cheese pizza were awesome. The Fusillioro pasta served with lamb ragu and ricotta cheese was delicious. 

We also ordered one \"main course\" (these are a bit larger than the small plates)...the veal shank, as recommended by our waiter and it was some of the most tender meat I've ever had. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive wine list and dessert didn't disappoint. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service food was great and desserts are over the top..Loud but great abiance"}
{"text":"The staff was horrible. Would not recommend this place. Did not grant our request and were not friendly what so ever. The view was nice but will never return again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Everything was mouthwatering. This is a very nice restaurant that pays attention to details. Every dish was beautiful. I can see why so many reviewers are taking pictures--they want to show their friends how food is supposed to look when it is served. We had:
SALMONE | Skuna Bay salmon | crispy caper 16
FUNGHI TRIFOLATI | mushrooms | olive oil | parsley 11
GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA | flat semolina gnocchi | blue cheese 14
RAVIOLI AI GAMBERI | shrimp-mascarpone stuffed ravioli | fresh tomatoes 17
AGNELLOSCOTTADITO | grilled lamb chops | garlic| rosemary 20
POLPETTE DI CARNE | tomato braised beef meatballs 15
The lamb chops are the best you will ever have. Everything else is very good.
We had an assortment of desserts. It would be difficult to pick one out as being superior to the others. 
As for ambiance, we sat at a table on the water. My wife and I agree this is the best location of any restaurant in Las Vegas. A table overlooking the Bellagio fountains on a pleasant April evening is hands-down the best locale in Las Vegas. 
All in all, it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I am a fan! I would come back again for sure!
I was debating between 4 or 5 stars and I'm giving it 5 stars for the waiter we had!

Location: great view of the Bellagio fountain
Service: 5 stars!! Our waiter was EXCELLENT! Such a nice guy. He definitely is a great asset to this place.
Food: small plates, share. Good quality, beautiful, fresh, appropriately priced. We basically ordered almost all the dishes off their menu.
Dessert: beautiful and delish! They also provided house dessert for b-day and it was really good--I think this was the service from our waiter!"}
{"text":"From beginning to end it was an ejoyable experience. The staff is friendly with great customer service. The chef is spanish so expect small plates (tapas), but very palate pleasing. Again, for being a Spanish chef it was the best Oso Buco me and my girlfriend have ever tasted. I was little surprised by the vast and varied selections of wines they have here. Kudos to the sommeliers, they look young and could pass for your next door neighbor's kid, but knows what he's talking about - so listen to him. Great ambiance, spectacular views of the fountains. Again just be prepared that they serve small expensive plates (tapas), great selection of wines at reasonable prices for the strip, and sitting out in the patio - the best view on the strip."}
{"text":"Where to begin with Lago!

I love eating at Bellagio and definitely expect great food and service when I'm there, but wow, Lago is above and beyond.

You could never tell it just opened this week. Service was amazing! It's shared plates-style dining so the dishes are small but plenty, which is awesome because you get to try so many flavors. Our server was welcoming and explained the dishes and cocktails in great detail. 

Speaking of dishes and cocktails, OMG. Chef Serrano does an exceptional job adding exciting twists to Italian classics with five-star presentations. The \"7&7\" (lobster and gnocchi) is to die for, and the salmon and scallop crudo (served raw with lemon aioli and some blood orange awesomeness) are ridiculous! The cocktails paired well with the food and were presented unlike any way I've ever seen. My bellini even came with a gold-dusted raspberry.

Perhaps the best part of dinner was the atmosphere. Very lively and modern with great vibes. Floor-to-ceiling views of the Bellagio Fountains--just breathtaking! The only way to get closer is swimming in the lake...which you probably shouldn't do. :)"}
{"text":"Lago has only been open for a couple weeks but you'd never know it judging by the efficient service and solid food. A beet salad was spot on. Goat cheese croquettes were perfect as part of a refreshing panzanella salad. The scallops had lots of hints of basil so beware if you're not into it. If you do like basil, you'll love this dish. Additionally, the scallops were cooked beautifully. A caramelized onion pizza was fairly salty but still a good dish. The pizza was plenty for two people and a very good deal. Until the east bank fully develops, Lago will be somewhat isolated but its well worth a trip down the hill."}
{"text":"Nothing in this restaurant is over the top. All the the food was average . Loved it when it was Circo.  The decor is not grand and it's not to the standards of the other fine restaurants  in LV. I would not go back. The $200 tomahawk steak looked great for the table but our server told us about other entrees .  The service was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experience in Vegas! Food was amazing, I would never guess that a Spanish chef can execute Italian food so well. Pasta is cook to perfection, and the desserts are to die for"}
{"text":"Went to their bottomless mimosa brunch with another couple.  I've never seen a three course brunch before.   We ate by the window and had the most beautiful view of the fountains.  The staff was amazing - manager checked on us for brunch!   This was the day we headed home and we had so much fun at brunch - and a number of delicious bellinis - we were considering changing a flight to stay another day."}
{"text":"Very poor quality for the price. Fruits look like fruits but it didn't  taste like fruit. Desserts seemed as if they were bbought at the frozen food aisle in the grocery store. And so on just go elsewhere my recommendation Caesar Palace Buffet."}
{"text":"This was a very good experience from start to finish. Our server was amazing. We were there with children and adults, and he made sure that everyone's needs were met.
The food --  we tried 6 appetizers and 6 main courses. and 4 desserts.

I am too lazy to type all of it out- but the highlites are -- seafood, cooked perfectly. Pasta, al dente. Dessert, sublime.

Pricey - yes. Should you care? No.
Go"}
{"text":"I went to Lago for the first time last night and it wasn't bad.  I was impressed by the service-- our server was friendly and attentive, the executive chef came out to say hello to our group, and the ambiance (excepting the music, which was a little too loud) was overall pleasant and upbeat, especially for a slow weeknight.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the food.  The calamari appetizer (which is supposedly one of the favorites) was rubbery and bland.  I preferred the antipasto platter, which was quite good.  Most of the members of our group ordered just a pasta or secondi course.  Each dish had a beautiful presentation, but I thought the portions were undersized-- and I am not a big eater (but I'm not docking Lago any points for that, because I find it refreshing that an Italian restaurant doesn't feel compelled to serve me five pounds of pasta).  However, the food itself was lackluster.  I had the veal tortelloni-- I enjoyed the sauce with peas and prosciutto, but the veal was dry and the dish didn't have a lot of flavor.  My partner had the lobster gnocchi, which had a nice lobster flavor, but not much else to it.  Other members of our party enjoyed their dinners, but nobody was raving about their meal.  One friend's soup was over-peppered, but other than that I think everyone was content.

I guess my three-star review boils down to value.  I would have felt much more pleased with my meal if it had cost half as much.  But for the cost of a night at Lago, I expected much more of a \"wow\" factor with my food-- something memorable, complex, or at least interesting.  I think Lago has the basis for an excellent dining experience-- an inviting atmosphere, talented staff, and a grasp on the tricky concept of a \"modern Italian\" restaurant.  If they can just make their food consistently as good as the menu sounds, they'll be fantastic.  Until then, I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"A must on the LV Strip. Do yourself a favour, make it worth the money you spend on this meal and make a reservation asking for patio seating. You will have front row seats to the Bellagio fountain show every 15-20 minutes. The decor of restaurant is modern and chic.

The food was really, really good. All meals are made to share so to give you an idea, my boyfriend and I ordered 4 plates and a desert, we each had a drink, and the total came up to about 150USD."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here at Lago. My fiancée made reservations for us and requested a window seat so we could get a full view of the Bellagio water show! We arrived about 5 min early and we're seated straight away in a beautiful corner booth over looking the Water show :) I loved how the waitress asked if we had any food diets, then i told her I'm Vegan & she was quick to let me know what I was able to eat off the menu and what could be modified. I ordered the minestrone soup with no cheese and bruschetta as they made it vegan by also making sure there was no cheese. I would definitely come back here to Lago again, I definitely recommend it to anyone local or visiting as it's a fun place to eat and see a show ;)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is chic and the food is phenomenal. Make sure you request a seat by the window or out on the patio for the fountain show. It is such a beautiful way to dine! Service was excellent (host and bartender were so-so) and we were never left wanting at our table for anything. Food & ratings:

Cesare salad- very light and delicious, not overly dressed
Tonno- such fresh ahi tuna with sweet oranges and a salty twist
Ricotta infornat- ricotta and balsamic is awesome
7&7-lobster cooked to perfection and gnocchi so creamy
Quaglia saltimbocca- only dish we weren't really impressed by, we had never eaten quail and not sure we liked the taste of the meat

For dessert we had a lemon bar with some sort of fruit sorbet which was very tasty and so beautifully presented. 

All enough for two people without feeling too full or hungry. 

Would definitely go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday the 10th. Me Wife Daughter Fiancee around 6:00. Lago was a little more than half full with not one table outside seated and was told by the receptionist they were booked. I said there are a lot of empty tables and she kept saying I'm sorry and offered us seats at the bar, I declined. I'm sorry she kept saying and said but people are going to be coming in. I said but there is nobody here now! I asked if a Manager was here and the receptionist just kept saying I'm sorry. We went to another Restaurant and had dinner. When we were done we went back to Lago and it was still only about half. The receptionist then said hey I tried to chase you down acting as if she could have seated us. I just told her we had dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food was great. The ambiance was terrible. Whoever the owner/manager wearing the OSU jersey and cargo shorts was awful.  Just go away. Nobody wants your shots. Ruined many peoples dinners. This guy was a Gordon Ramsey manager to the T."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Cocktail program was good. 3 stars only for the lack of communication. Manager sat us at the lounge communicate they were almost closing it was 10:30pm, that the kitchen would be closing soon. We order as fast as we could. Long story short they still seated more guests at 11:30pm they order food they did not rush them. The food was delicious. We felt rushed it seem last call was B.S. I would expect that behavior from maybe New York New York. Not Bellagio.
Lounge Server was very polite had great recommendation."}
{"text":"Fast, courteous valet coming and going. OK maitre d's. Exceptional service in terms of knowledgable and personable as well as very effective in making things happen.  Bread to die for--lots of crust and two varieties. Pleasant salads.  Above aver soups. Fish great.  Pesto penne average.  Ditto risotto & peas but really large portion.  Peanut butter dessert terrific.  Carrot cake great with way above average blend of cream cheese frosting and cake--you don't feel uncomfortable after eating it.  Place jammed Sat night, Dec 28.  Very noisy.  Difficult for conversation.  Packed bar."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere in Lago. Foods are good! I love Italian foods anyway. But the wines were kinda expensive ! :-( 
$25 by glass. Plus the portion each plate is kinda small. 
but customer service is amazing tho."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place. Im surprised by the good reviews w/ so many better places out there. Maybe I just picked the wrong dishes but for the price I don't feel encouraged to give them a 2nd chance. 

Beef Carpaccio - 3/5 If your in Bellagio just go to Olives for this. After eating it there anywhere else you have it will seem sub par. Lago's version can't even begin to compare to Olives. 

Kobe Beef - 0/5 The meat itself was literally the size of a matchbook, I knew it would be tiny but was still excited to try it. I cut the meat up (even though it was itty bitty bc I was trying to be dainty). Question, Have you ever bit into a piece of meat that made your mouth water, looked tender and flavorful only to have an explosion of grease fill your mouth? Ya me neither and it caught me off guard. I couldn't even finish this TINY sad piece of meat that's how bad it was. Was it deep fried? We paid $39 for this?..this animal died for you to turn it into something completely inedible. Shame. On. You.

Fusilli Ragu - 4/5 Had great flavor but the pasta was overcooked..like I had to scoop this shit bc it fell apart. Im not a stickler for al dente but this was ridiculous. Everyone liked the flavor though.

Caesar Salad - 4/5 Would have been the best part of my meal but had a little salty aftertaste. Wasn't bad just different.

Meatballs - 4/5 They're just meatballs what else is there to say."}
{"text":"Celebrated my hubby's birthday and I ordered a Seabass - (sea bass | capers | olives | tomatoes | roasted asparagus). I could say it was really, really delicious that wishing I could have their ingredients. The birthday dinner really looked cool and all our friends kept asking of what was that oval shaped next to the cake, they thought it was a Balut, commonly sold as a street food in the Philippines lol"}
{"text":"I reserved a table here for a surprise romantic dinner with my girlfriend with a request for outdoor seating, we showed up a bit early and were still able to be seated. We were right at the  edge next to the fountains of bellagio and had a nice fire next to us to keep us warm. The food was beyond delicious (despite small portions). My girlfriend was awed by the beautiful view and I might have earned the best boyfriend of the year award ;p I had a great experience here and a memory I'll never forget. Staff were kind and professional, food was amazing, view was amazing, I would highly recommend this and highly recommend sitting outside if you're there at night just be sure to reserve a table ahead of time."}
{"text":"Rather disappointing. Long wait to get a table even with a reservation. All the food was under seasoned. Drinks and desserts were good. Restaurant was incredibly loud and it was a very bad ambiance."}
{"text":"Very upbeat atmosphere, average service, food is good but not as good as the original Julian Serrano at Aria. This the the italian version of spanish tapas. 
Our server was so busy with so many tables that each time you need something, it would be 10mins before you can get a hold of him.
Food: creative menu, average execution, very small portions (about 5-6 plates per person, unless you plan to go eat somewhere else again)
Conclusion: worth trying once, but not good enough to come back"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying... My Husband is the \"Elite Yelp\" guy... So I never write these...Well this time he wasn't there.

My background is I'm an Event Planner.. With that being said I always look for Customer Service FIRST. I 've been a regular visitor to Las Vegas for over 30 years! My recent location to stay is the Mandalay Bay. I am the type where I usually get all Accommodations comped! Room, Food, Beverage. 
This was a trip we've been planning for years... Finally my Baby was turning 21! Her ultimate plan was to go to VEGAS!! 
Having a ton of experiences with MANY restaurants there I searched for days trying to find the perfect fit for my daughters 21 Bday dinner! There was 6 of us and I wanted an Experience plus amazing Food and of course impeccable service! So of all the Restaurants we could choose from... We chose Lago! 
It had the Water Show view, (experience), Great reviews on the Food (amazing Food) Great Service (Impeccable service) We only found those things out by reading these reviews and asking those who were familiar.

That turned out to be quite a bit difference from what we read... 
The Food Was AMAZING!!! The Server (I believe her name was Monique was AMAZING)
But we had to get past the WORST part first! Dealing with Albert Najem (the GM)

We made reservations on Open Table, made it VERY CLEAR it was a Special Occasion and Requested to sit by the window for the water show...
I then called the hotel and asked to talk to someone inside the restaurant (not a call center) I made sure I was talking to someone in the restaurant. They claimed they were one of the hostess in the restaurant! I confirmed that we would be seated by the window and that was one of the main reasons were were coming...
I also said that we will be arriving in in a limo with a time the limo would be waiting to take us back and they said our seating request and timing would be fine!!

So here we go..........When we arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservations we were greeted by Albert Najem (General Manager) he told us without hesitation that there was over an hr wait for the tables by the window... I said we had reservations specifically for that and told him I even followed up with a confirmation to the restaurant... He still said well I cant help that. his demeanor was very condescending and he really didnt care that I was so upset! 
He then offered us 2 other tables (1 being in the middle of the room- only being able to see the water in the sky... and the other a small shoved in the corner table with our backs to the water) he couldn't have been more UN accommodating. Didn't care that I took so much to make this reservation... was REALLY POMPOUS! He offered no gestures of an apology except for the sending over 2  Lemonchellos (1 for me and 1 for my daughter) TOTALLY CLASSLESS! At least i could have been a round... We never ordered them... we all had ordered drinks and he could have easily come over to say im taking care of your drinks and dessert... 
I then asked our server to have him come over... he did and I told him the least he could do was comp our drinks... you would have thought I asked him to take care of the entire restaurants dinners checks!

the experience was totally RUINED by Albert and I will pass this on where ever I can!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing. Food was perfect prepared. Service was spot on and the ambiance beyond hip."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant ever. Terrible customer service. The food was disgusting. The pasta is not homemade. Our waiter was atrocious and obnoxious and so we're the people at the reception. We were freezing and asked to go outside to have the heating lamps, not to move us they said there was a wait to move outside even though the terrace was EMPTY. the only good part was the fountain. I wish I could give it 0 stars. 
DISGUSTING. Go to Yellowtail instead. Gross. Ew. Never again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  As a foodie that travels all over the USA and beyond, I did have great expectations of this restaurant, despite reading some of the bad reviews, and taking into account the \"tourist trap\" location.  The food was underwhelming and bland.  Some of the items seemed to me to have been pre-prepared and stored in the refrigerator, because the tomato & mozzarella salad and the cheese plate we were served were chilled to the bone - a dead giveaway. The risotto was under cooked - risotto should have a sheen to it, and be cooked through - not served al dente \"crunchy\" as this one was.  Honestly, I can't even remember what else we had, it was that unmemorable.  We paid our bill quickly and headed to the roof top bar of the Mandarin Oriental for drinks and dessert.  Now that part of the night was incredible..."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a variety of crudos, cheese plates and pizzettes over a bottle of champagne and it was a really refreshing meal.

Sit out by the lake if you can! You get a great view of the Bellagio fountain show and it's a relaxing break from the craziness of the casinos."}
{"text":"Came here for a GF birthday dinner (we're Vegas regulars) ... Ambience was on point, but food disappointed ... Had the Caesar salad, and the lamb Fusilliro pasta  and the Osso Buco.  Everything was great except for the veal Osso Buco ... Taste was completely off ... Very bland ... Tastes like pulled pork, not veal ... GF tasted it and was also disappointed.  Expect more for $170"}
{"text":"Website said casual. Showed up for lunch wearing nice shirt, nice pants. Hostess looked us over and said \"I'll see if we can accommodate you\". The restaurant was empty since they had just opened for lunch. Everyone that did show up was wearing suits and dresses. 
Ordered a Rosso Belini, sea bass and veal with a dessert. Food was blah! Tasteless, no seasoning. No salt or pepper. VERY DISAPPOINTED! 
Best I can say is the view is amazing and the restaurant is super clean. 
Lunch ended up costing us $100.00.
Left there feeling like I paid $100 for a tastless snack. 
Will not go back! Totally not worth the money."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday for first time. The over all decor is very nice as was the staff. The Arancini had decent flavor but sauce was not made with much thought. It was like reconstituted tomato paste with a little flavor added and too much salt. My main course was the baked half chicken over white bean purée with escarole and \"Italian barbecue sauce\" on the chicken. The bean purée was cold and heavy on the salt. Escarole was good. Chicken was cooked perfectly. The barbecue sauce tasted like the sauce on the Arancini just with a little barbecue flavor. A few of us ordered dessert, tiramisu - was ok but I would never recommend it to someone. Lemon panna cotta with raspberry sauce was good. Service was slow they could have used another server or someone out on the floor helping. 

I would recommend this restaurant with hesitation. I expected higher quality from this place but just didn't find it. It will probably do well by default, meaning the people who are not interested in Ken Stewarts extravagant steaks will go here since the only other option is willeyville for those that work in the Ernst and Young building."}
{"text":"Nice surprise, Pretty good food, and knowledgeable waiters. Started with the salami anti-pasto, overall pretty good, not too rubbery(!) like lost of the crap we get over here, followed by the quail (a little over cooked), best described as a paillard, two very thin filets, very tasty and a massive serving of the mushroom side which was excellent.

4 stars, mainly because a conference was in town so they had row after row of 10 seater tables to pack 'em in. VERY loud, with nothing soft on the walls at all.

Oh, and also had a lunch there: spaghetti frutti di mare was excellent, and a lot quieter."}
{"text":"The food was good but not excellent. The flavors are original. The service was good but not exceptional. The decor is amazing. Tried this place twice but I still prefer Julien Serrano Spanish tapas original namesake restaurant. 
Food 40/50
Service 20/30
Décor 18/20

Total 78/100"}
{"text":"We were staying at Bellagio and just wanted to eat somewhere decent for lunch and came across Lago. The reviews and photos looked pretty good through Yelp so we made an appointment really quickly (the morning of, maybe about an hour earlier) and went for lunch.

The decor was not appealing (for me), but couldn't judge too much on this as most Vegas restaurants are the same caliber in design. One great thing was that they gave us seats along the windows, which overlooks Bellagio's famous fountain. The restaurant was not full, so all the customers had at least some kind of view of the water show!

The customer service was good, nothing bad nor absolutely amazing. But the food was just okay - nothing was really delicious. We got the Agnolotti di Vitello (veal ricotta stuffing) and Ravioli al Gamberi (shrimp) and both were mediocre. The agnolotti was at least interesting, but we didn't really fancy the taste much - though eating it with the dark sauce definitely helped. The ravioli was really just underwhelming with a simple tomato sauce - just super basic and the tomato sauce was too bland and didn't have much character for my taste.

All in all, it was just an okay restaurant - everything's overpriced in Vegas so I'm not necessarily looking down on the pasta prices because it's just a bit over the \"average\" we'd pay in LA (agnolotti being $17 and ravioli being $18).

The customers next to us got the pizza and that looked pretty good - though, pizza is tough to mess up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on our anniversary before seeing Cirque du Soleil \"O\" at the Bellagio. Great food, on the patio, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. 

Lago serves small plates for sharing, think of Spanish \"tapas\", except Italian. They do have some \"main-course\" meals, which may make sense if you are eating alone, but part of the great appeal of Lago for my wife and I was being able to order a selection of wonderfully prepared dishes without stuffing ourselves. 

When I made the reservation, I asked for a patio seat. It turned out to be one of the coldest days in Las Vegas. I asked the hostess if we should sit inside near the windows instead and she said that they heated the patio and suggested we take a look first. Glad we did. With the heaters we were comfortable. Some other folks had light coats on, but we had just come in from Minneapolis, so perhaps our tolerance for \"cool\" weather was higher :-)

I highly recommend sitting on the patio. Being able to watch the fountain as you eat really adds to the experience. Actually, I would only want to sit on the patio or next to the large windows overlooking the fountains. We had an early reservation, so had no issues having our seating requests accommodated (though I also make the request when making the reservation). 

The seating in the front part of the restaurant might be okay if you are there with kids, but I would avoid it for any more intimate dinners."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, one of the best in the strip if I can say so myself. Small plates but the flavor is well emphasized in every bite"}
{"text":"I went to Lago for their weekend brunch and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Lago is a gem that Cleveland should be flocking to. Very affordable, especially considering the location and decor. Flat breads are amazing. The lasagna is enough for 2 to share and the bone in Filet is hands down one of the best. Please treat yourself to the scallops for an appetizer as well. Impressive wine selection that I was actually surprised by too. 

The service has always been stellar and the staff super friendly. (I almost always sit at the bar). Not stuffy at all. The bar tenders are both witty and on top of their respective game. 

After dinner you should stroll to either the WXYZ upstairs to try one of Justin's signature Martinis in the aLoft or next door to Ken Stewart's to try a Moscow mule. 

Great job to Fabio and his team."}
{"text":"Cool space that Is in the new flats.   Kinda cheesy connected a hotel.  Staff dressed well but looked like they wanted to be some where else. 
Service was solid but when the food came the dreams were broken.  The meatballs were still frozen.  I returned them and they sent out ok ones.   Then we had some pasta dishes come out.  Totally disappointed. Is there any good food in the flats ? 
Sad.  Next time"}
{"text":"I had the meatball sub got 3/4 of the way to notice the bread was molded. (Disgusting)
Never again will I go there. This is what happens when you cut corners. You loose customer s and then the business goes to hell. Will not ever recommend rather go to Ken Stewart's."}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for her B-Day dinner and she loved it.  First request a table by the window or patio so you can see the Water Show.  It's an amazing view, since we were celebrating a birthday they gave my wife cannolis on the house.  The food was very good we had both a cheese and salami platter and two tapas.  The bill was under $100 keep in mind we didn't drink any alcohol."}
{"text":"Pappardelle Polpette aka spaghetti was simply amazing!  Small amount of spice, HUGE meatball that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Dear Chef Serrano,

Congratulations and thank you for what you have contributed to Las Vegas and to countless of food lovers.

Your dishes continues to be true to form.  Based of time proven classic cuisine and delivered with flair.

On behalf of all those you have trained during the years I say than you as well.

My meal was spectacular.  The service was spectacular.  The view, pretty much speaks for itself.

My only regret is San Francisco loosing you to Las Vegas.

Still nice to know I can always come and visit and ALWAYS have a spectacular meal as long as you are at the helm.

Of all the superstar chefs of Las Vegas I know of no one more dedicated that is there in person night after night to let nothing less than perfection leave the kitchen.

BRAVO and again thank you for what you have given,

MFH"}
{"text":"I booked a dinner for 40 people.  We had a prefixed menu.  It was very expensive per person and I must say it was extremely disappointing.  It was served family style and the servers did not even give us serving implements.  The food was mediocre at best.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Amazing in all aspects, food decor service....fruits infused with Wasabi were awesome"}
{"text":"While trying to make a reservation at another Bellaggio restaurant, the person I spoke with recommended this one.  I made the reservation there because the time fit into the show we were seeing.  

When we arrived at the restaurant they said they couldn't seat us at a table with a view of the fountains for another 90 minutes, and the restaurant was really bright inside.  We said we would try somewhere else.  I went back to confirm something with the time, and magically, they were able to seat us at a table with a view.  That was REALLY irritating.

However, I must say the wait and bus staff were excellent.  There were plenty of people around and our server was particularly visible, helpful and available.  Because this is a tapas restaurant that is KEY.

Some of the highlights were:

Crostini with chicekn liver 
Scallops with orange and pistachio
meatballs
Risotto with tripe and mushrooms (I never had tripe before, but this was a good dish)

The crostini with salami and gorgonzola was just ok, as were the baramundi, 

Presentation was lacking on almost all of the dishes, but, they are still working out the kinks.

All in all, I would go back again and would recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"It is on the pricy side but the food and cocktails will not disappoint. I had the Kobe Beef with asparagus potatoes and it was delicious. Every bite was the perfectly seasoned. I would make reservations since this place gets busy on the weekends. The cocktails are unique and strong so I would recommend trying ones that are aligned with the liquor you are accustomed too because they are strong. I note there is nothing wrong with strong drinks and personally prefer them that way. It was a great experience eating hear and when I stay at the Bellagio again I will definitely be making my reservation."}
{"text":"This was such a terrific dining experience. The wait might be long if you just walk in, but it is worth it. The service was prompt and attentive. The view of the fountains is a nice bonus, but the star of the show is the food. Everything was expertly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and just the right temperature. 

The little 4 oz filet was divine. The duck, artichoke with crab, branzino, and the tuna crudo were also favorites."}
{"text":"We went to the dinner service on Christmas day, and what a disappointment. The reason of the 2 stars is for the way the manager handled things, the food deserves 0 stars; this restaurant NEEDS a new chef urgently. We ordered;
2 margherita pizzas $15 each
RAVIOLI AI GAMBERI
RISOTTO AL VINO ROSSO
LINGUINE AL PESTO
CANNELLONI
 First the pizza was less than 8\" super skinny and flavorless, Celeste's frozen pizzas have more flavor. The canneloni was supposed to be PULLED short ribs, I received a disgusting dark paste inside two cannelonis, flavorless and definitely NOT fresh. The linguine was extra hard, no flavor, the ravioli tasted like COSTCO frozen shrimp ravioli. Honestly nothing is worth the price they're asking for. There's no creativity in these plates. The best thing about it is the environment, that's it.
We complaint, returned our dishes and spoke to the manager. She covered the only two things that were eaten, which it was the pizza for our kids. Honestly, for an \"upscale\" restaurant in Las Vegas, dinner service should be made to impress, this was a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Just don't.  The staff was rude, the menu did NOT deliver and was over-priced.  There are so many other better places to eat in Vegas, do not waste your time and energy here.  Stop in for a cocktail and drink in the design; it is a beautiful spot.  And the bartenders are professional and kind.  But eat elsewhere, anywhere elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stumbled here by accident. Everything we ordered here was amazing. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very attentive to us. The food was absolutely delicious. We had the pizza (awesome), fussili with lamb ragu (amazing), and osso bucco (the meat was incredibly tender and full of flavor). My husband and I were nearly licking the plates."}
{"text":"One of the only places open for lunch at the bellagio. Food was good but service was really slow. I would recommend getting the ahi tuna crudo and the charcuterie plate."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Excellent service. especially love the scallops. My first experience here was outstanding. While waiting on our scallops, our waiter gave is meatballs, calamari and dessert all bc he said our order was taking too long (we hadnt even noticed!!) now thats service! The menu is amazing and the food is terrific"}
{"text":"Wonderful, creative, Italian small plates, beautifully presented. The staff is charming and gracious. The drinks are imaginative. The decor and atmosphere are lovely. There is a beautiful view of the fountains outside. The prices are not bad for Vegas. I had Kobe beef, which was terrific, and some chopped liver on toast. The food came with an olive bread, and some mouth watering basil infused olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. This is a great place to eat and share small plates."}
{"text":"I don't understand how there can be so many good reviews for this restaurant. I actually would give 4 stars for the patio location. It's a nice view overlooking the fountain. But the food was extremely disappointing. We had the crostini with chicken liver. It was overly salty and didn't have a lot of taste. We also shared the salmone which was actually ok , but also had very little taste, which to me means the salmon wasn't that great in the first place. Quality salmon should melt in your mouth and have a rich flavor. Next we tasted the gnocchi with lobster and then the shrimp stuffed squid. The gnocchi appeared cooked and then broiled, which I know can be done, but shouldn't be. It tasted like they had cooked the gnocchi earlier in the day and then reheated it to get a bit of a crunch.  Good gnocchi should be light and tasty. This was chewy. The lobster tasted of nothing. The shrimp stuffed squid was the worst dish of the evening. The squid was super chewy like eating a rubber band. Very unpleasant. The dish also had very little flavor. If you are use to good food then go elsewhere. If you like Olive Garden then you are probably ok eating here."}
{"text":"The brunch is unreal. The service was perfect and it wasn't too busy. Expensive, but worth it"}
{"text":"The lobster gnocchi is absolutely amazing! Love the environment and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"We visited for a birthday dinner and the whole evening was perfect.  The best Caesar salad I have ever had!  We also had the wild boar lasagna, meatballs and veal tortellini - everything was delicious.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful interior design and colors. Food and cocktails were spectacular. Love the small plate concept, which you can try different dishes. I will definitely come back again and recommend Lago to my friends."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here last night! For us the pork ribs and the chicken pate crostini were the highlights. We tried a few other dishes that folks recommended like the 7x7 and the Caesar salad and I wasn't blown away.

The view was phenomenal though! Request a seat near the window if possible. It's rare to find a restaurant with a nice view and good food!"}
{"text":"First time in a Julian Serrano restaurant and it was a pleasant dining experience. The outside dining room was booked so our group (6) sat overlooking the fountain area. Drinks at the bar were excellent- cucumber cocktail and a Sicilian gin/tonic. 

The place has an upbeat mood along with efficient service. The waiters will recommend some shared small plates so take their lead but order as they come out as you may over order if all up front.  Everything was very good and portion sizes were fine. Especially liked the short ribs, pasta, veal and assorted Pizza's. 

Suggest trying different deserts (were out of cannoli) - especially liked the light fruit panna cotta and lemon desert. Wine list was also diverse and although priced on the higher end, you should be able to find a nice reasonably priced wine - IL Borro super Tuscan 2012 was excellent. 

Fun place especially with a group..."}
{"text":"Attended Lago for Valentine's dinner.

We were incredibly excited for this, and made reservations three months in advance to ensure we were able to visit.

Could not have been more disappointed... Yes it was Valentine's day, yes it was busy. But we arrived two minutes prior to our 8 p.m. reservation, and were told there would be a 30-minute wait, and we should wait at the bar. What? Okay, I'm guessing by the other reviews this is just what they do to try to get one more drink on everyone's tab, but that is unacceptable in my books. Oh, and the cocktail I had was awful.

We were then seated in a corner, small table, with literally no view of the fountains. My wife received a rose upon seating, which was a nice touch.

Our waiter could have cared less about serving us, even after we ordered a $180 bottle of wine (having said that, the person keeping our wine glasses full, who was not our waiter, was very kind and attentive). We went easily 20-minutes without seeing him, and when it was time to pay the bill, he disappeared for 30 minutes (seriously, we timed him); upon which I went to the bar to ask if I could pay there. They said \"where's your server, he will serve you\" ...

The food was seriously nothing special at all - in fact, it was quite tasteless and very poorly presented. Again, maybe this is because it was a busy \"holiday\" night...

Lago is located in the Bellagio near the North Entrance - skip it."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Food and service were remarkable. They made a special dessert for our anniversary.  
We will be back. Lago is now our new favorite in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We came to Lago Restaurant for New Years Eve. We made reservations a month ahead of time with the Concierge desk at the Bellagio.  We were looking for a place where they would have entertainment, good food, and outdoor seating. We were promised that the Lago would have a very good entertainment program and for a hefty additional fee, they could guarantee an outdoor table. Which we have agreed to pay. 
We made reservations for 10pm. They seated us on the outdoor patio. All the New Years decorations were inside, none were present outside. They had a DJ again inside, but nothing for the patio. They distributed party favors inside since 10:30pm, they did not get to the patio area until 5 minutes before midnight and at which time they ran out of men's hats. 
Many of the outdoor heaters were not working. The fix menu was OK. The kitchen lost all the tickets so the food took for ever to get to the table. We ordered Champagne at 11:30pm so we may get it by midnight for the toast, we did not get it until 12:30 after repeated requests. 
To add insult to injury, at 1AM they started putting all the lights on and the few outdoor heaters that were working,off.  They wanted everyone out. 
In conclusion, food average; service, entertainment, embiance all MEDIOCRE at best."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Red sauce served with the calamari is delicious.  On the late night bar menu there are fabulous tacos with mandarin oranges.  My husband and I just kept reordering them.  We also love the burger there.  Food is always great!"}
{"text":"Pasta dishes were delicious....ambiance was nice and had overall good service.  Had to wear my sunglasses at our inside table because of the ridiculous amount of Sun coming in.  Turns out the drapes/blinds are all show and do not actually function.  Prices were fair for a nice eatery.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for lunch. It was a beautiful hot day so we wanted to sit out on their patio. Service was good and we never waited long for refills on our drinks. I ordered the caprese sandwich and it came with rosemary chips (as did other sandwiches). It was delicious! Others in my party ordered the meatball sandwich (came with three huge meatballs) and the BLT (several thick slices of bacon)- both of those were delicious as well! I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A minority opinion here: overpriced and overrated. Not bad, but this place would have been barely passable at 2/3 the price.  Expect to be fed, not to dine. 

Service: slow and not responsive.
 
Drinks selection: wine adequate to barely ok, beer seriously subpar. 

Food: Apps: salumi plates could not be mixed or matched, and the salumi served was no better than you can get in an average grocery store.  $5 for five slices of bad salami, another $5 for not very good prosciutto.  The only pizza option with tomato sauce was bland."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best. But the reason for the low rating is the horrible service and the horrible horrible attitude of the staff. We called in advance to reserve a table. The number on the yelp page is the hotel number and not the restaurant and they failed to actually send the reservation to the restaurant. We made a reservation for 7:45 and got there at 7 to realize that our reservation has not gone through but were told that our table will be ready in one hour. We sat in the lounge and ordered drinks and appetizers. The server said the portions are too small and we need to order 3,4 menu items per person. That was not true and the portions were not that small. Overall they were trying a bit too hard to make you order more and more.  And they are not friendly at all and at times even rude."}
{"text":"Just sit at the bar. Called ahead to find out, sadly, Olives was closed. So, we tried Lago as recommended. My call was transferred to concierge who said patio seating was first come first served. Asked to make a reservation but was told they weren't busy so no reservation needed. On arrival, told the opposite at the hostess stand. Sat in the bar for our wait time of 45 minutes. Got excellent personalized service there and great food. After getting our patio table outside, we waited over 35 minutes with no attention and no service with empty drinks. Finally walked out and nobody tried to stop us. The manager was minimally apologetic and offered no assistance to convince us to stay. Walked away. Will never return. Went to Aria for an extraordinary meal, drinks and excellent service!"}
{"text":"We should have known what we were in for when we got to our seat and the cushion was upside down in the chair (I turned it over to find it stained with food or a drink). 

Boyfriend and I ordered brunch, which was a choice of many different items. First we ordered coffee which came in a tiny cup and was lukewarm (diner quality). He got the Mac carbonara, which he later compared to Chef Boyardee, and lobster Benedict, which was ok. I got the shredded salmon pesto salad, which was fine but the temperature contrast of the hot salmon and room temperature salad to the clearly refrigerated apple was a little odd, and the Italian sausage burger which was fine. Dessert buffet was a major letdown - tasted like pastries from a middle tier grocery store (think mass produced). Strawberries in chocolate fountain were good, though. Best part of brunch was by far the Bloody Mary, which was extra spicy and actually quite good. On the flip side, it was fun to sit outside and watch the fountains. 

Overall, NOT worth $90 per person."}
{"text":"Tapas restaurants are always fun and exciting but this place blew every tapas restaurant I have ever been to out of the water. The food was absolutely decedent and actually not unreasonably priced when you take into account the quality. We each ordered two tapas and the portions were very decent. The service was impeccable ofcourse and the theme of the restaurant was a stunning and clean ocean theme. I would recommend this restaurant more than any I have been to on the strip."}
{"text":"The waitstaff was perfect. Our guy was not only personable and always around at the right time, but also recommended a martini that would be coming off the menu as the season is set to change. He was so right; It blew our minds it was so good. And it wasn't even the most expensive martini on the menu.

The food was delicious - some of us got scallops and others lobster gnocchi. Fried goat cheese balls on one of the salads was also a major hit. Also, get the creme brulee. I can't wait to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Why didn't I find Lago sooner?! Best view of the Fountains in Las Vegas, incredible customer service (ask for Jennifer as a server) and AMAZING food. I went for Sunday brunch and had the duck and polenta to start followed by the filletino (small filet which was so tender I didn't even need a steak knife) and it came with asparagus and hash browns. The steak was very flavorful. 

Definitely go for the bottomless mimosas- it was different than any other one I've had. Comes with this cool flavored wand and a gorgeous, edible sugar decor with the glass. Very lively ambiance and despite how busy they were, the managers (Albert and Lucio) made an effort to make sure we were happy and felt at home. 

Now I'll have to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"Always incredible. The food is amazing and bartender Christopher never fails to show us a good time, plus the man makes a damn good drink. Make this spot a priority the next time you are in the area."}
{"text":"Breathtaking! We were lucky enough to have fountain-side seating. We were celebrating my fiancé's birthday and we started it off with a bang. She was in love with the view. It was beautiful. Our sever FABIO was fantastic....nice, funny and educated on the menu. My fiancé has certain dietary restrictions and he created a menu for us. It did not disappoint. To the point where we basically needed to be wheeled out of there. Thank you for a memorable night. Won't be forgotten and will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow... This is not good! It has been 10 years since a new restaurant has opened in Bellagio and with Lago, it is disappointing. The service is dreadful. I mean... The Bellagio... This service was terrible! The food was also just okay. The tomato and burrata salad was just typical. The way it was plated was very boring. Next up was the zucchini pizza. Not bad, but again typical. We went to our next course which was the lamb ragu. This was pretty tasty, but the presentation was lack luster. Everything that touches the table, including the napkin and beverage naps has the Lago Logo on it. Very Cheesy!!! I think I get where I was dining. I never looked up and said... Where am I? From our female bartender to the Sommelier, the service they offered was very poor. The restaurant was not that busy, but yet they made it look like they were running around like crazy. I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was a great place food wise, especially the tapas. We had the oysters, pizza, summer squash soup, antipasto with burrata, and the caprese salad with fresh mozz and heirlom tomatoes.  Also had one of their signature gin cocktails. Expensive, but not disappointing at all. In a city where everything is overpriced, at least this one doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Had two wonderful dinners in a row here! Denise is such a pro and makes you feel like you are her most important priority. The food is excellent, the gnocchi was the best I've ever had, they truly taste like little heavenly pillows smothered in a firm Gorgonzola cheese sauce. This place is worth the money and the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Great staff, food, and decor/lighting."}
{"text":"Drinks were generous with alcohol....good point. Service friendly. The food was quite 'pay'thetic (sic)...skip the food and, no, would not come back for the alcohol either. Puck, Oh Puck, disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner and a show. If you're able to get a table close to the Bellagio fountain it will add to the ambiance. We enjoyed the small plate style and spent most of the evening slowly moving from plate to plate. The food was excellent with a staff that enhanced experience. The wine by the glass list could be expanded but this is only a minor item."}
{"text":"First off, the food here was SO good. It's Italian tapas style so all dishes are small and meant for sharing. Everything was fresh, and the flavors went very very well together.  The gnocchi with lobster knuckles was AMAZING as was the canneloni. The service was also impeccable.  Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing and took notice of the fact that I was OBSESSED with the Bellagio fountains - he offered to walk me to their outside tables and take my picture while the fountains were going. so sweet!

The only thing I would change was (1) we ordered a bottle of champagne that came out after almost all of our tapas were out (5 dishes).  That was a little late for the champagne for me... I think they could have brought out a few dishes and held off on the others while they waited for the champagne to chill. just IMO.  (2) the red wine risotto we had was heavy on the wine and low on the other flavors. since we ended with this dish, it left a sort of sour taste but we let it go since everything else was SO good."}
{"text":"The worst \"Fancy\" restaurant we've been to in Vegas. Made a reservation at 7:30pm, got seated at 8:20pm, what's the point of a reservation?  Our server was not too informative, no recommendation and seems too be very rushed. Maybe want to turn all his table around quickly so he get more tips. Food was a Ok and below, drink was good. Luckily, I had a $100 food credit from M-life, so I ended up paying about $80 out of pocket. If I had to pay $180 for this meal, I'll cry a little."}
{"text":"We ate at Lago on a Sunday evening and our tablt overlooked the fountains of the Bellagio. We reaally enjoyed the small plates dining ad we were able to share many different dishes. The lamb ragu padta and pata negracwere off the hook good and the wine list was exceptional. Our server was very knowlegable and guided us expertly thru the entire meal.

Highly reccomend this restaurant."}
{"text":"A reason to return to the Bellagio! Something new and exciting at the former Circo property by Julian Serrano. The renovation was well worth the wait and one of my top places that I was anticipating. We were greeted at the front by very friendly hostesses that informed us we were free to view the restaurant while we waited. Wannee was especially helpful and informed that our beautiful table on the patio was ready and what a beautiful night it was to be outside.
The room is very modern European with a nod to retro.  The color scheme starts with warm orange and red tones near the front, then graduates to cooler blues in the back of the restaurant with white the backdrop. Straight ahead is the view of the Las Vegas Strip and the famous Bellagio fountains, to the right is the lovely patio.
We were seated right at the edge just as the fountain show began, there was even fog on the water which made the view even more special. The weather was perfect and the Strip in the background was ever so pretty.

We chose a few small plates to try. Brian our server suggested the crudo sampler, there was tuna, scallops, and salmon.  We also had a Cesar salad, the risotto, short ribs, and their famous gnocchi and lobster dish that melted in your mouth! Oh I cannot forget to mention the quail saltimbocca!!! Try this twist on the classic saltimbocca, I like it much better than veal or chicken versions. They have a nice choice of cocktails and even the bartender made me Virgin cocktails that were refreshing and beautiful.

Dessert was also excellent, the menu being on same Ipad list as cocktails and wines. Very fun and interactive. Sharing is encouraged here and this is a spot pre-club kinda place. Where you can still eat good food and feel comfortable to dance the night away. Hyde is located next door and Lily and The Bank are very close.

Thank You Julian Serrano and the Bellagio for bringing me back to this end of the Strip. With Omnia across the street, I feel there is a new pulse of life into the Las Vegas dining and club scene!"}
{"text":"Great to go with a group of friends because it's all shared plates.  We got the truffle mac and cheese, tomahawk, sausage pizza, and scallop crudo.  When we go out to eat we always have the server pick out our menu because the know what the best plates are."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! From the service to the food, everything was impeccable. My reservation was on time and we were seated on a table overlooking the fountains at Bellagio, beautiful. Our server Mickey was beyond attentive and recommended to speak with the sommelier to order the bottle of wine for the dinner, which was, by the way, perfect for our meal. We ordered about 7 dishes, they are \"tapas\" style so portions are smaller than usual. They were all very well executed and flavorful, but my favorites were the 7&7, the cioppino and the canneloni, to die for! I'm not a dessert person but I wanted to have the full experience, what a great surprise! Definitely go for it. I totally recommend this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I really wasn't sure what to expect. Kind of assumed the food was going to be overpriced and terrible and, well, it is really expensive but we had some real winners. I plan on returning for the spaghetti di fruti di mare alone. It was amazing. We also tried a gnocchi dish which was really different from any gnocchi I've ever had - really light almost fluffy, not gummy. The mushroom risotto was the least impressive - I've had better at Disney World! I'd also say this wasn't the romantic venue we were hoping for. The location/view were amazing but the restaurant is super crowded and loud. The service was great though.I LOVE it when restaurants have a server just for drink refills. We left a hefty tip."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my parents while in town .The view of the fountains was very nice (well, would have been very nice had they been on when we were there) and there was a lovely area to eat outside if one wished.  The meat patty sandwich (think flattened meatball) was well received and my chicken Caesar salad was perfect, with the chicken remarkably moist and the anchovies not at all over powering."}
{"text":"This place is your typical tourist trap.  You pay big dollars for small amount of food.  It would be justifiable if the flavors are worth it, but sadly it's not.  I would skip this one.  I suggest going off the strip.
Staff that don't have a clue. Especially our server and the Manager. Food came out very late over 35 minutes for the first serving and at different times for the remaining hour. I  just wanted to have a nice dinner with friends and they had eaten and finished their dinner and my basic seafood risotto still didn't hit the table. 
I have many qualms about Lago.  First the place is so loud you cannot speak to your company.  Second the service is pushed, too intense and not at all relaxing. 
More importantly the food was just so so.  Small portions, way too small in my opinion.  10$ for three slivers of lettuce is a joke.  The Sea food Risotto was Chef Boyardee out of a can quality!!! 
I hate going out to a place with mediocre food and leaving $150 poorer and still have to go eat elsewhere because I'm hungry 2 hours later.   Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Like Johnny Manziel, I'd go bananas too if I had to eat this stuff more than once.

Arrived at Lago on a late Saturday night (9/26/2015) for drinks and dinner.  Excellent waterfront location, complete with a fireworks show at the mouth of Lake Erie.  The high points end there.

Stewed* calamari was okay, with small rings served in a tomato sauce so thin that dipping table bread was required for consumption .  Ordered a variety of flatbread pizzas, which was a mistake.

Unlike the excellent gourmet grilled pizzas of Al Forno (Providence, RI), or even Trade (Boston, MA), in which light, crunchy crusts supplement simple (or fancy) ingredients, Lago's crusts were nearly concrete.  Even after vigorous sawing with a steak knife to reduce the size of pre-sliced pieces, each chunk took dedicated chewing with water or wine to soften the bite enough to be swallowed.  Similarly, cheese and toppings were dessicated by the cooking process, eliminating any saving sense of flavor.  In summary, I ate garlic-flavored hard tack.

Unable to eat the pizza, I ordered more wine.  Maybe this is their business plan?  Or maybe this is why Johnny Football remains an alcoholic.

*Edit made post proprietor comment. Admit mistake made on memory of calamari. Flatbread pizza, however, was fundamentally bad. Comparisons were meant to indicate that it is indeed possible to not botch this menu item."}
{"text":"Overpriced, extra tiny portions, and staff was frantic with half of the restaurant empty. Get it together! I ordered a caprese salad, came with 3 slices of mozarella and 3 slices of tomatoes for $16! Can I at least have a full tomato for $16? :)"}
{"text":"Had reservations made by M life a month before the restaurant was even open at 7:00 on Saturday for my husbands birthday. We were seated right away unfortunately at a high top table by the bar. The music was extremely loud and it seemed like the whole place was shouting over it to hear. It was hard to carry on a conversation. Started with olive focaccia.... Tiny & too greasy. Next we had the red wine risotto and gnocchi with lobster. Risotto was absolutely fabulous!!! The gnocchi was good but it was not the consistency of either a potato or ricotta gnocchi...more like a rolled mashed potato with a firm exterior. Both portions were very small. Couple bites each. We ordered clams and the filettino for the next round. For the $$ they were both shockingly big portions and both very good. They surprised my husband with a desert for his birthday that was wonderful & very thoughtful. Even though our food & service was good we can't see ourselves going back. If I'm going to spend a lot of money on dinner I at least want to sit at a nice table and carry on a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"If you want a great dining experience, let's be honest--you can find it anywhere at Bellagio. They definitely have this whole food & beverage/amazing service thing down. Still, Lago is just beyond. From the location (floor-to-ceiling windows and even an outdoor patio overlooking the fountains--pretty flawless) to the decor (sleek, modern & gorgeous), let's just say I would be here every night if they would have me (what would it take to get my name engraved on one of those tables...?)

The menu consists of small plates meant to be shared (they recommend 3-4 plates per person), which you'll love if you're like me and want to try ALL THE THINGS. If the menu is overwhelming (everything sounds amazing. hello!), your server (shoutout to Frank!) will guide you through the best of the best.

Some of my favorites include the \"7&7\" lobster and gnocchi (want to eat this, exclusively, forever. will die happy if this is my last meal. you get it.), all the crudo plates (the scallop one is ridiculous. didn't think I liked scallops before this. game changer), the focaccine with ricotta and honey, margherita pizza and the osso buco (veal shank). I assume there's a word-count limit here, so I'll stop myself, but just know that I could go on... 

I'm still working my way through the fabulous cocktail offerings, but so far I've been blown away. No detail was overlooked in creating these beautiful drinks (the Rosso Bellini straight-up has a caramel nest propped atop the glass with a golden raspberry nestled inside. Is this real life?). The Cucumber Mist is super-refreshing, and I may or may not have had two of them back-to-back. I also loved the Passion Fruit Mojito. But, like I said, won't quit 'til I try 'em all #goals and will report back. And, do check out the bar area--great atmosphere if you're just looking to try out a couple drinks and small plates.

Thank you to Chef Serrano and the entire Lago team! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love love love Lago!

I've been there three times.  Each time, we received exceptional service, great advice on wine, and, most importantly, delicious food.

I love the inside.  It's kinda dark and swanky, but it doesn't feel oppressively so.  I enjoy the water glasses--trivial, sure, but for me, little things like this make a difference--in their icy blue shade.  They are also not too heavy or big.

Pear Martini is the frickin' BOMB.  So is most of the wine we've tried.

Waitstaff is so friendly and gives you time to make up your mind.  They also realize that you're probably going to want more bread, and they ask you if you'd like it before you have to track someone down to bring it to you.

One of the three times I was there (yesterday) was a Vegetarian Monday, as the other reviewer mentioned.  It was spectacular.  I, too, tried the vegan Caesar, just to give it a shot, and - wow.  I told my husband last night that it could have definitely been the best Caesar salad of my life.  The romaine was crisp and refreshing, and presented still in long stalks instead of already chopped, which I thought was a nice touch.  Also, the roasted tomatoes on the plate (not usually in a Caesar) were out of this world.  And the dressing....I don't know how they did that creamy deliciousness without milk or cheese, but, I gotta hand it to them.  Amazing.  My husband tried the bruschetta on polenta last night and was also wowed.  We've also had the vegetable cannelloni, a regular mixed salad (one recommendation:  order the dressing on the side; it can be a bit overpowering), and some fried mozzarella appetizer.

I have NEVER been disappointed in an entree from Lago; in fact, I always have quite the opposite reaction.  I have had the airline chicken--succulent! atop vegetable lasagna which could have been its own dish (in other, more \"chic\" cities, they would never consider pairing these, mostly because it's like you're getting two meals for the price of ONE!), the lobster gnocchi, the ravioli, the sundried tomato gnocchi with garlic cream sauce...all great.  Last night, though, was by far the best.  I got the pasta special--veal tortelloni with pancetta and peas in cream sauce--that had me almost licking the plate.  Apparently, this is a dish that constantly goes on and off the menu and came highly recommended.  I asked the waitress, \"Why do you ever take this OFF the menu?\"  She replied, \"We gotta keep you guys wanting it.\"  I guess that might be part of the appeal...but I haven't had an Italian dish that well done since I used to frequent Little Italy in NY.  I only wonder why Lago doesn't seem to get as much business as it deserves."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing and almost made up for how atrociously disorganized the Bellagio is. 

So let's start by saying I got ditched at dinner because my friend got called to poker after being skipped all day (we'll get to that in my review of the bellagio). 

The staff was so sweet and accommodating. The views were gorgeous. The food was great. I would absolutely go out of my way to dine at Lago again even though I will not be staying at the bellagio ever again and probably will avoid doing any further business with ANY MGM casino/resort.

The staff was very attentive and professional. I worked in the restaurant business for years so I know what to look for and I was highly impressed by their over all presentation and quality."}
{"text":"Didn't like the ambience of the restaurant. It's very casual and served pizza which is OK but would expect more for a restaurant that considers themselves fine dining and has great reviews. The decor in my opinion was tacky there was really no dress code so people came in very casual."}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant. On the pricier side, but all of their food is worth it. It is a tapas style Italian restaurant and bar. 

Started the night off with a beautiful cocktail (I forget what kind it was but it was fruity and delicious, a recommendation from the bartender). We had drinks while we waited to be seated. 

Once we sat at our table, we were greeted by our servant who took very great care of us. He recommended multiple dishes and they were all delicious. The pappardelle was cooked exquisitely, al dente, and the veggies that accompanied it were very fresh. The branzino was thinly cut and flavorful. We got the cheese platter to accompany the branzino and they went well together and separately. We got other items plus dessert, but honestly I don't remember the names of them but they were all very delicious. Though expensive, every penny was worth it."}
{"text":"Boring dishes, ceasar salad was unnaceptable. Wine list had zero wow factor. Service was fine. Wont be back"}
{"text":"We had a table right next to the window. If you go during the day just make sure they aren't doing maintenance for the fountain. Still really good food, I had the margarita pizza and my wife had a shrimp pasta dish. They were the perfect size portion for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance, great view of the Bellagio lake. Great varieties of selections for any occasions. My favorite was lobster gnocchi, and got to save some room for dessert too, hazelnut praline, yum!! Can't wait to visit again to try out more of the menu. Definitely recommend this new additional of Bellagio!"}
{"text":"Have been to Lago on multiple occasions, and now will never go back.  I purchased a deal from Living Social where $40 gave you $80.  After we ate our meal and presented the printed coupon, we were told by the manager that they were not accepting these coupons from Living Social.  He told us that Living Social set the deal up illegally and they would not honor the coupon.  We were also told that we should have received an email informing us of this, and that our $40 should have been refunded to our credit card by Living Social.  We received no email, and certainly no refund.  I took exception to the notion that the Lago manager repeatedly took the stance that it was Living Social that made the error, and they were doing nothing wrong by insisting we pay the full amount of the bill.  It was, and still is, my feeling that Lago certainly could have taken ownership of this situation, and taken care of our meal.  Shoot, even if they'd posted a small sign at the entrance that Living Social coupons weren't being honored it would have been better.  After all, Lago entered into the agreement with Living Social as a method of attracting new business.  Unfortunately, to take the stance  that they were completely blamelss and nothing was owed to us was a slap in the face to to us, who were, until now, repeat customers.  In the spirit of customer service, this should have been handled differently, and as a result I will never visit Lago again.  There are many great places to eat in Cleveland besides Lago, and I'm sure they will appreciate my business."}
{"text":"I had my surprise engagement here Saturday and all I can say is Mike Nadolski and the whole Lago group could've have made the night anymore special. From the venue to the food and drinks, everything was absolutely perfect. I'd been here once before during happy hour and enjoyed it but their service was awesome and the day would've have gone nearly as well without Mike!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while i was in town, very glad as the caprese panini was delicious. My wife had the linguini with clams and was very happy with hers as well. EVErything was very fresh and the staff was friendly. The price is not cheap but worth it for the taste of the food. If I'm back in Cleveland again i hope to stop again."}
{"text":"I was recently in Vegas with a large group (over 20 people) and was pleasantly surprised when I found out we would be dining at Lago for dinner. This place was on my list, so getting to check it out was fun!

First of all, the decor and ambiance of this place is top notch. It's gorgeous on the inside and has floor to ceiling windows that provide a good view of the fountains from many of the tables. We were seated directly across from the bar close to the pizza oven (so about halfway into the restaurant) and could still see the top of them. I would not want to sit at the front of the restaurant because it's open to the casino and just doesn't seem quite as special.

Second of all, the food! I enjoyed almost every dish that we ordered. The plates are small and pretty pricey, so take that into consideration (the 4 star rating), but hey, it's Vegas. It's kind of part of the whole deal. We ordered...
- CAPRESE
- MARGHERITA PIZZA
- RISOTTO AI FUNGHI E PARMIGIANO
- FUSILLIORO
- GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA (My favorite... like clouds!)
- COSTA DI MANZO
- SCALOPPINA DI VITELLO (the only thing I didn't eat bc I don't eat veal)
- CHEESECAKE

I would definitely recommend this place for a true Vegas dining experience. Get a table close to the fountains for sure. You can even order a $60K bottle of wine while you watch! :)"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice modern ambiance! I really  love the concept of smaller plates, Tapas Style. Our waiter, Marcello was very nice and taking good care of us. 
Every dish (and we had many) was delicious. 
The Chef recommends to order 3 to 4 dishes per Person. As we were hungry, we both ordered 4 dishes. ....and that's, what we didn't like so much (only 4 Stars instead of 5), we suddenly had too many dishes on the table at the same time. Some of the food got cold before we even could taste it.
I also think, that the Dessert Menu could be bigger.
Since LAGO not only serves Mediterranean Wines, it would be nice to follow the trend of a lot of fine and good Restaurants and have Gruener Veltliner on their wine list.
My husband and I definitely will return to this Restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant that overlooks the Bellagio fountains. We came here for lunch and they had a variety of food from pasta, pizza, salads etc. the food was delicious I was tempted to order seconds because it was that good. However be prepared to be waiting. The restaurant was not crowded but it took our server an unnecessary amount of time to take our order and bring us our drinks. Note that the food took about an hour to prepare was well but at least that was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Had reservations and had to wait an hour before being seated. Food was good, but not the best bang for your buck. Great view of the fountains."}
{"text":"Food quality: ~3-4 stars

My favorites were:
1) Kurobuta Pork Ribs
2) Cannelloni 

+1 for the fountain view."}
{"text":"I can only review my experience because I never actually got to eat at this restaurant.  My husband made reservations two weeks in advance of our trip to Vegas and when we showed up for dinner they didn't have a table for us. We were told that it would be a 45 minute wait and the hostess would call us when a table was ready. Over 2 hours now and we haven't gotten a call. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and sat in a beautiful corner booth overlooking the fountains. Ordered the lunch prix fixe and selected the seafood salad, followed by crispy, perfectly fine branzino. We finished with the tiramisu and chocolate cake. Beautiful lunch in a gorgeous setting. Prix fixe was a terrific value for a 3 course lunch of 28 per person."}
{"text":"Food portion is tapas style so it's small snack size just FYI.  The restaurant was filled with more of an older crowd but the ambience was nice. It's located right beside Hyde nightclub.

Came with a buddy who happens to be a pro poker player. I will explain why this is mentioned later.


Had the mussels, clam, whole lobster, 7n7(lobster and potatoes) spaghetti di fruiti (spaghetti with seafood) and the Kobe beef. 

mussels sucks. Don't get it.

Clam was really good especially the sauce.

Lobster was ok.

7n7 was the best dish, highly recommended

Spaghetti sucked. Wasn't stingy with the amount of seafood but the sauce was very lacking especially since I had similar dish at diners and Italian restaurants in New Jersey that were much more flavorful. It was what the server recommended

Kobe beef was good but very small. Maybe two oz at max.

My biggest gripe, and maybe I am being bitter about it was the service. My buddy who I mention is a pro poker player been to the restaurant many times which he mentions to the server. He tells the server that this is my first time on this restaurant and she needs to explain and provide service to me. 

So in the beginning she was somewhat helpful with a great recommendation of the spaghetti which I will not recommend to anyone who bothers reading this review.  She asks what the occasion is for our visitation. And we tell her that our buddy is here for a poker tourney.  Her attitude immediately changes for greater once she finds out my buddy is a pro which wasn't a surprise. However the ditz completely disregards me and not once after asks if food was ok, if service is ok, if i needed anything. She asks him only if he wants desert. My buddy seeing the way ditz is acting asks me if I want deserts hoping she would get it but unfortunately that's not the case. I said sure and she brings out a desert menu which she lays in front of him and starts going over what's good.. Once again only to him. My buddy asks if I want anything and I tell him nope but she doesn't hear me obviously and keeps trying to recommend to my buddy what's good. We politely decline and ask for our check. Of course the ditz put the check in front of my buddy which I kinda took offensive too but whatever. We have it charged on the room and since it was my turn to pay for the tip, I generously gave her 15% which was 15% more than she deserved.  The helper? Who was dressed in black company outfit and not in a dress, was actually much more helpful and provided better service.  Sounds like I'm writing this review out of jealousy lolol.  

I was taught that if you ever run across a daughter who you are interested but happens to be with her mother, you always treat and entertain the mother first and foremost. I hope the ditz get it one day instead of being blinded by greed for more tip? Or just trying to find a meal ticket out of her life."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the taste of some dishes but the patio is unbelievable. It is the cutest place to sit out on a date with one of the best views of the bellagio fountain. I'd come back just for the view."}
{"text":"Best prix-fixe in Las Vegas. $28 for a 3 course lunch. I had seafood Salad, lasagna Verde, and a beautiful dessert. Outdoor table facing the Bellagio fountain and thw Paris."}
{"text":"Food 3-4 stars 
View 5 stars (sit outside)
Staff 5 stars 

What we ordered: panini porchetta, insalata di mare & sausage on the side, and italian fries. 

salad: lacked flavor because it needed salt! I couldn't taste the grapefruit in the dressing... which was unfortunate because I only got one small finger size sliver of grapefruit! I love grapefruit! Other bites were just okay oily bites.. I love seafood, so it was good bites of variety of seafood... BUT again...even a tad bit more salt would have made a world of difference! Good thing I ordered the grilled sausage on the side! Sausage was delicious!!!

panini: i had few bites and it was yummy! 

italian fries: twice fried. you can't go wrong with twice fried fries! It was awesome! 

Our server was great! Our view outside was spectacular!"}
{"text":"We selected this location for my husbands birthday lunch. I saw where they had a tasting menu only to find out they didn't. But wait!!! They brought us a tasting menu and said we were more than welcome to order from it. The service and goodness did not stop there. The miso plate, lasagna, and oh SO beautiful birthday dessert all while sitting next to.the Bellagio fountains make this place fabulous!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I've been to any other place where we had somewhat of a bad table and still loved everything about our experience.

Our seat wasn't terrible but did not have a real good view of the Bellagio fountains.  We reserved for brunch ($38 pp).  I expected to get little value for money but I could not have been more wrong.  

The brunch is technically 4 courses: bread and pastry basket, second course entree, third course entree, and a dessert buffet.

The second course was a selection from roughly 10 items.  My date opted for the duck and polenta, which was pretty amazing and I selected the carbonara pasta which was decent but not mind blowing.

Our 3rd course, was yet again a selection from list of items available. She chose the scallop and shrimp over rice and I ordered steak and eggs. I was extremely jealous when I saw her plate but one bite of my steak and I couldn't have been happier.

The final course was a dessert buffet with pies, cookies,  crepes, bread pudding, and a chocolate fountain with fruit and other items for dipping.  We tried a few thing but were pretty full.  

They did have bottomless Bloody Mary and mimosas for 28.  Maybe next time.

Really awesome place, at least for brunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful lighter options for lunch. We ordered a variety to share. Pizza was average. So many good pizza places around the Strip; it didn't stand out. The branzino and agnolotti were both delicious. 

P.S. For all parents, I wouldn't recommend ordering milk here. It cost us $6 for a cup."}
{"text":"One of my TOP 4 favorite Vegas Brunches that I frequent & LOVE!  Lago's Sunday brunch & bottomless mimosas & bloody Mary's all to die for.  Julian Serrano has never disappointed me as a matter of fact, he personally introduced himself to me twice & recommended a certain  thing which will be part of my Yelp on his Aria restaurant.

Lago's brunch is a magical & artsy display of colors & beauty overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Order both the bottomless mimosas & Bloody Mary whichever you prefer first, but definitely try both.  Come w/ an appetite & take all that this 3-course brunch has to offer!  

The pastry basket is an Italian twist of yummy cornetto, zeppole, muffins, scones, croissants, donuts, cinnamon rolls & bombolone.  I've eaten here many times so will not steer your taste buds wrong.  In order of my favorite & highly recommended, let's begin!

First Course choices...
ANTIPASTO MISTO:  Burrata, prosciutto, salami, olives, bell peppers.  Awesome w/ one of their wines from a fantastic selection of wines. 
MAC CARBONARA:  Pancetta, eggs yolks, pecorino, black pepper.  Rich & decadent small macaroni noodles mmm!  I'd add a lil spice to it of course.  
CAESAR SALAD:  Roasted chicken & hard boiled eggs.  It was good, but needed more dressing.  

Second Course...
CHICKEN \"FLORENTINE STYLE\" A-Must!!  You could cut the moist chicken w/ a fork.  It's stuffed w/ this delicious spinach-ricotta!   So tasty & my absolute fav!  I want it on the menu everyday!  
ITALIAN SAUSAGE FRIED BURGER:  House made Italian sausage & fried egg.  Large so share everything!  Even though they are known for small plates, the whole brunch is very filling.
EGGPLANT PARMESAN BENEDICT:  Exactly what it says w/ a poached egg.   I actually didn't like this at all.  Bland, tasteless, but perfectly poached egg lol.

Lastly the BEST part!!  Why you shared & saved your appetite is the unbelievable DESSERT DISPLAY!!  
The PANETTONE PUDDING oh melt in your mouth!  It's like they made it w/ love as your mom or grandma would.
CLASSIC TIRAMISU & NUTELLA CRESPELLE also do.  

Let's get back to the artsy wonderful mimosa & Bloody Mary's.  I squeezed all the creatively placed Tabasco, horseradish & soy sauce droppers stuck in a cucumber display all into my Bloody Mary.. Mmm tasty & so good!  It's also filling.  The mimosa taste is ok, but the lavish golden sugar display on top is absolutely the most beautiful mimosa I've ever seen.  Picture worthy!  

Overall, I love Lago's for all meals, but especially brunch.  Treat yourself to all of this from $50 to $80.  It's worth every second & starts your week off on the right foot."}
{"text":"Superb service, amazing osso bucco, picturesque view. Love this spot, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Our original plan was having a dinner at a fine dinning with the entire family. Unfortunately it's not kid friendly so we got recommended Lago and I'm glad that I gave it a shot. It wasn't quite fine dinning but it's nice a good enough. Like any other Bellagio restaurant, the decor is elegant and service was top notch. My lamp chop with tomato sauce was great. It carries nice balance hint of rosemary as well. My kids had the clam spaghetti and they loved it. We will come back."}
{"text":"+1 star for the view, +1 star for service, -3 stars for the food. The food was not worth the price. $55/person for 3 course brunch on Mother's Day. The \"burger\" was a fancy egg and sausage sandwich. We expected to be amazed, instead my entire family was disappointed with the food quality."}
{"text":"Well. I left less than charmed with my meal at Lago.

My friend and I popped in quickly without dinner reservations at the tail end of the night. We were seated in the lounge chars in the bar area which I would recommend against sitting in if you are planning to eat a meal. The seats and table height are awkward so eating off of plates was slightly uncomfortable. 

We ordered the following dishes:

-alla ricotta e miele: ricotta cheese with a layer of honey on a densely packed focaccia roll. For 8 bucks, you get a dense piece of focaccia bread with a ricotta spread and drizzled with honey. It's...good. The first bite was great, but overall, the bread was heavy and I didn't anticipate such a sweet dish to start my meal. A more savory dish would have probably been more satisfactory. I would recommend ordering more than one if your party includes more than 2 people. 

-tonno crudo: ahi tuna slices garnished with orange segments. 4 slices for $19. The tuna was rather sinewy which I didn't expect. The chewiness was a distraction from the rest of the dish. No good.

-spaghetti chittara: tomatoes, clams, garlic oil all tossed over al dente spaghetti noodles ($16). The noodles were perfectly cooked and this was probably the most positive thing I can say about the dish. It was bland. I ordered the dish expecting the clams to infuse some sort of seafood flavor into the broth, but I got none of that. It felt like the clams and tomatoes were just garnishes over very well cooked spaghetti noodles. 

-fusillioro: corkscrew pasta tossed with lamb ragù + spuma di ricotta ($15). This was the most flavorful dish of the night. It was robust and had nice touches in flavor, but was slightly unremarkable. 

Lago is the epitome of Las Vegas: fine dining with a so-so menu, but nothing spectacular. If you're looking for a nice place to dinner at in Vegas, I would suggest that you put in that extra ounce of effort to scout out an amazing meal. Lago needs some time to develop."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Wonderful service and exceptional food. Authentic, good Italian food. We ordered seafood spaghetti and it was so yummy. The coffee liquor drink is a must! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesomest place to have desserts in Las Vegas with an amazing view. Their dessert menu is to die for.. and they have so many vegetarian and vegan small plates. Wine collection is really nice. We sat on the outside patio, facing the Bellagio Fountains and the Eiffel Tower Restro and by the sunset, the feeling was so soothing so relieving and so romantic.. 

We loved the desserts so much, that we visited it again to try the once that we missed in first visit. Would love to go again."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant that over looks the Bellagio water fountain. However, the food here isn't something I rave about. 

started off with some bruschetta- the ripe, fresh tomatoes were delicious and flavorful. The bruschetta was simple but yet super tasty. It was served on top of grilled buttered toast. 

steamed clams- the white wine broth was a little too light and the clams were a little fish tasting. There could be more seasonings to help mask the fishiness from the clams (perhaps some garlic)

steak- the steak was perfectly cooked at medium rare, but the sauce was way too overpowering and salty. It would have been nice if the sauce was a little lighter and the focus would be on the meat rather than the overpowering sauce. 

seabass- the mild flavor of the seabass was a little boring. It could have use more of a springy lemon taste. It taste like seabass that was just cooked on a grill with no flavor. 

Overall, Lago you were a beautiful restaurant, but little details of flavor were lacking."}
{"text":"Here is the 3-1-1: 
Food: Tapas, Tapas, Tapas.....and every size and type make this an excellent place for small and big parties. The grilled octopus over squid ink cous cous is a must have and the ceaser salad which a simple small serving of 3 lettuce bunches and anchovy dressing is refreshing. The vegetarian pappardelle is great for sharing as the vegetarian ragu does not disappoint.

Service: Dishes come out quick and the wait staff is super helpful on recommendations and how much is too much. 

Ambiance: Well lit and décor is bright and colorful and if you are lucky enough to be seated by the window the Bellagio fountains are an added bonus."}
{"text":"Great ambience, service, view, decor... And the food!   Wow. 
It's a contemporary take on Italian small plates so a perfect opportunity to try out the myriad flavors and food preparations all while overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. 
2 highlights of the meal-
The 7&7 gnocchi and lobster was exquisite... 
The Agnolotti di Vitello was extraordinarily decadent...
Make sure you request a table by the window be ready for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"My fiance took me here for my birthday dinner and it was one of the best meals we have both had in some time. 

We started at the bar with a few glasses of happy hour wine and snack of house made chips. Our bartender suggested we try the chips with parmesan on them and they were out of this world. The owner offered to buy us a round before heading to our table and once again the bartender recommended our new favorite wine! The experience only got better from there.

Table service started out with delicious bread. The server was very welcoming and attentive throughout the entire evening. I opted for their delectable and creamy lobster risotto and was surprised about the amount of lobster in the dish. It was so filling I could not finish it all. Their short rib fell off the bone was some of the best we have had. 

They ended the evening with a surprise tiramisu (complete with birthday candle) that was to die for! It was the perfect balance of flavors and great end to the evening. 

The combination of quality service and product make this a top contender for the next date night."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night for a late dinner.  I ordered one of their special drinks that had bourbon and lime in it.  I can't remember what it was called but it was very good, not too sweet.  We started off with the calamari and meatballs for appetizers.  I personally found the calamari a little rubbery but my companions loved it.  The meatballs however were fantastic.  You get three rather large meatballs and I initially only took half of one, but it was so good I had to eat the other half.  For my main entree I ordered the veal tortelloni.  It was delicious.  Very rich, very savory, and I loved the flavor and texture the peas added to this dish.  Definitely worth ordering.  I also ordered a side of the grilled zucchini and squash.  They were cooked perfectly and tasted fresh, not drowned in butter or anything.  I wish I was able to try one of their desserts because I'm sure they are amazing but I was just too full.

The service was a little inconsistent.  At first our waitress was very attentive, but after we ordered our appetizers she disappeared for a while.  We had to flag down another waiter to order our entrees.  And it wasn't very crowded so I'm not sure where she went.  But everyone there was very pleasant and the hostess seated us even though we were waiting on one person.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place and would absolutely eat there again."}
{"text":"Showed up for our reservation and were told they were waiting for some tables to clear. 30 min later we were seated. Hoped for a higher level of customer service (acknowledgement of the wait, overall friendliness....it was just very matter of fact-you're table is ready, follow me). We were seated without a drink menu, which was odd since typically you order drinks before food. The drink menu came later. I ordered the Lago Cocktail sweet, and it came spicy. One of the menus was dirty with food-switching out the page would've been a quick fix. Some plastic drink cups and spilled food remained on the floor behind us for the entire time we were there. Caprese salad and ricotta and honey focaccia were excellent. Shrimp w/ white wine lacked flavor and presentation. Filettino was perfectly prepared. Mushroom risotto was okay. We left still hungry-too underwhelmed with the food and overall experience to try additional items."}
{"text":"We got an amazing table last nite during our first visit  to Lago~great view of fountains on a Fridat night.  We enjoyed everything we tried pretty well~loved the crudo scallops and salmon, meatballs and lobster gnocchi. Drinks were a touch on the sweet side can't recall exact names-rose & rye ? And the cucumber drink.  So good food and nice view possibility for those that are considering. It was definitely louder than we were expecting but wasn't a big deal to Us but something to know if that type of vibe is t your thing.  We were there for my husbands bday and no one referenced that it was a special occasion which was also a bit of a bummer"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Over a 4 day trip to Vegas, it was the best meal I had. Dishes we enjoyed were the Caprese, 7&7, seafood risotto, bruschetta, and several others. Everything was so tasty. I definitely recommend if you're ok with the steep prices."}
{"text":"VERY, VERY Nice! And definatly worth going.
   A couple things you should know B4 you go to Lago~
   We have had lunch here and enjoyed it very much. HOWEVER we just had dinner and would NEVER GO BACK! The noise level is OFF THE CHARTS!!!! Party of 4, literally could not hear across the table. Absolutely ridiculous!  The food was fine and our server, Nadar spoke loudly trying to compensate for the noise~ Granted its a Saturday night so be warned maybe it's better during the week....  
    1) Lunch is served till 2:30 & the Dancing Waters don't start till 3pm. This will be the BEST VIEW of the DW you will EVER have, so book a reso and be sure to request a table close to the window. All seats in dining area are pretty good, the bar area could be challenging to see.
   2) Nice menu selections, tapas style. Full plate options available. 3 Course Lunch Special $28.00 w/o drink unless u have water~ I had the Minestrone Soup (REALLY DEEELISH!) Full of fresh tasting veggies, great broth with a dollop of pesto. It was chilly today so soup was a gr8 choice ~ Main course was the Branzino, cooked perfectly on a bed of baby tomatoes, asparagus & capers in a lite buttery sauce. The fish is the star here with the skin grilled nicely (easy to remove if you don't prefer it) The dessert option varies as it is a chef's choice, I indulged in a deconstructed Tiramisu which was OUTTA SITE!!! With dessert ordered cappuccino & it was good, however it was delivered about 15 min B4 the dessert was.
   This is the reason 3 stars NOT 5 as the service was not gr8, and waaaaay to much time lapsed between courses, had to ask for lemons 2x's, Iced Tea never refilled. It's these little things that are not expected @ a Julien Serrano restaurant. Would never happen @ Picaso (which yes! I have been to!!) also Masa's in SF, where the service is and has ALWAYS been phenomenal!!! The server was nice enough, just not aware~ 
   Lago's price point is classic Strip pricing. Cocktails $17.00, cappuccinos $5.25, I will say the Smoked Peach Margarita was quite good, and was not light in tequila ~ wasn't overpowering but I definatly wouldn't drink 2, then drive..."}
{"text":"Loved Lago for the atmosphere! The View on the patio is spectacular. Do this place right with enjoying a nice BOTTLE of wine or their signature cocktails are just extraordinarily amazing ! Rib eye was ok, and the small plates are the route to go!!! Service was excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Full house last night: both service and food were unforgettable. We sat out on the terrace and it was chilly. Thank goodness for the heaters. We had so many great dishes to share: their off the menu fois gras was simply amazing. Hemache crudo was also top of the list. Seafood risotto I could do without. Sommelier recommended excellent Italian wine for pairing. Of course... the view! One of my new favourite on the strip."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here but was overall very disappointed in the food. We got the Margherita pizza and pesto pasta and both were pretty mediocre. The pizza was pretty much like a frozen pizza. The crust was tough and really didn't have much flavor. The cheese was rubbery and the sauce was boring. The pesto didn't even taste like pesto...it tasted mostly like oil. There was almost no basil flavor to it. For what I paid, I was kind of annoyed by how bad the food was. The service was very good, though...but that never really makes up for lackluster food.  So disappointed in my dining experience here, especially since we had to pull all the stops to even get a table."}
{"text":"Outstanding place to eat.  Portions are perfect, and the visual presentation
Is beautiful.    Great service, and the homemade pasta dishes we got were prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"The food was unbelievable, but definitely very expensive.  We split a few small plates.  Standouts were the pesto pasta (the pesto was clearly homemade) and shrimp stuffed squid (which I had never seen before - SO GOOD!!!).  Our server recommended 3 - 4 plates per person.  We did not follow this guideline, as this would have been very expensive.  Instead, my boyfriend and I split a bruschetta and then split four more \"main\" small plates - essentially 2.5 per person.  This was more than enough for two normal sized humans.  We were plenty full.

The atmosphere was also great.  We were seated right by the window for a view of the fountains.  

My one main complaint (knocking a star) is that the wine prices were outrageous.  The cheapest glass on the menu was $16, for a wine I have never heard of.  The good wines were $19, or $90 for a bottle.  In my opinion, this is out of control.  We just drank Goose IPA for $9 (still slightly overpriced, but it's Vegas)."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday Brunch.  While it wasn't bad I was expecting more.

Pros: 
GREAT fountain view
Beautiful restaurant
Friendly staff
Service & seating was quick

Cons:
Food wasn't as impressive as I would have expected.  
Good but not great for the price.
Selection was pretty limited. I expected some brunch standards and was surprised to not see any of them."}
{"text":"When it gets busy, service can slow down and help can be a struggle. Only deduction.  Food was really good. Sat next to the window and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains. On Saturdays, they start at noon so it was perfect."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food & service. The menu is moderately priced & have a great drink menu. The bone-in filet is one of the best steaks in town. I Definitely recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night and I'm glad we had reservations as the restaurant was busy! We were seated by the great hostesses and had a nice corner booth over looking the Bellagio Fountains. As locals and for girls night, we always try and find a restaurant we haven't been to. Lago is beautiful and staff was friendly. The food was amazing, it's tapas style so ordering three dishes each to share was enough for us. We had Caesar salads to start along with the ricotta and honey toast! Amazing. We liked the 7x7 dish so much we ordered a total of three for 4 girls! The lasagna was so good and the ravioli with shrimp, yum! The lamb was cooked perfectly and took the longest to come out but worth the wait. We ordered every dessert there and none of them failed to disappoint. My only suggestion, was service. Though the staff was friendly, we had to ask for water multiple times. Other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent concept and loved the small dishes. Salmon was nice, if a little dry, and the spicy shrimpy was excellent. So was my flourless chocolate cake. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice ambience good looking staff that don't have a clue. Especially our server. Food came out at different times and the server made some cock and ball story \"that is the style\" bullshit, just wanted to have a nice dinner with friends and they had eaten and finished their dinner and my basic pasta ravioli still didn't hit the table. Seriously how long does it take to bang out 4 pieces of ravioli? I have to say the manager was really nice and hot as hell but the waitress was a dumb broad. Oh and then wait.... It finally arrives and as I'm eating, a second dish magically appears! Come on people get it together !"}
{"text":"Everything you need to know is in the reviews - but let me break it down for you. BEST view of the fountains, hands down! But, the entire restaurant doesn't necessarily have a good view. Also, quite pricey - to be expected given the quality of the chef, the food and the wine list. Negative reviews of this place tend to cluster on those two issues.

So - what did we do? We went for a LATE lunch - you know, that time of day where no one really is eating? Like 2:00 p.m. Rolled in, the place was mostly dead, asked to sit outside for a prime view of the fountains that begin at 3 p.m. Ordered a bottle of wine, leisurely enjoyed the wine, ordered some appetizers & salads. Then we shared a couple of the pizzas (the fig one was to DIE for) and each ordered an entree as well (I got the ravioli and my partner got something with lamb that was amazing!). We communicated to our server that we planned on a leisurely lunch and he was fantastic at being attentive but giving us space to enjoy each other's company and the view. Best of both worlds this way - an amazing meal (still pricey, even at lunch, but about half what you'd pay at dinner), an awesome view (by the timing getting to choose our seating - especially since we rolled out by the 5 pm dinner rush), and a high quality dining experience. Try it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Massively dig this place.  Went here for Yelp eats but we were so interested in the menu that the 50% off Yelp specials didn't mean a hill of beans to us...Panzanella salad was a unique mix of flavors.  Fresh veggies, fried goat cheese and a slightly sweet balsamic reduction.  Spot on.  Then we had the meatballs, grilled scallops and lobster gnocchi.  All were excellent.  Those meatballs!  YUM.  Right spice mix, great tomato sauce, and a nice dusting of sharp Pecorino Romano (at least that's what my palate told me).  The outdoor patio is charming.  Chef Josh came out and introduced himself to us...nice touch.  Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Our group of five friends visited Lago last night. The interior and patio looked lovely, and our comfy booth table was ready on time. 

The drink menu listed interesting concoctions, but most of us felt that cocktails were all a little lackluster and unbalanced, not as sophisticated as the price or wait time would indicate. 

The food followed suit.  We started with the white bean puree, which, tasted exactly like white beans pureed without any seasoning or anything to make it special. The accompanying toasted bread was also bland.  We enjoyed the freshness of the rosemary chips that we ordered as an appetizer as well, but again, they were under seasoned.

Those who ordered salads seemed pleased with them, with one friend remarking afterward, that it was her favorite part of the meal.  

I had the grilled tuna steak for the main course. The tuna steak was clearly high quality, and it was cooked to order, but it was way too big, and again, under seasoned. The accompanying saffron risotto and olive tapenade stole the show, and I made sure to work a little of them into each bite of tuna in order to get some flavor.

For dessert, we shared the tiramisu and a chocolate mousse.  The tiramisu was a rather pedestrian interpretation, but the chocolate mousse was rich, creamy and delicious, exactly what it should be.  Splitting it among the five us of us was perfect, a couple bites is all most diners would want.

Our waitress seemed a little a little frazzled, but the bussers refilling water were on the ball.  It is one of my pet peeves as a diner to be out of water, so this seemingly simple feat scores major points for service with me.

Overall, our experience was not awful, but not amazing.  The menu descriptions seem designed for foodies, but the presented food and drinks seemed designed for the cheesecake factory crowd, big and bland.   I would be willing to give Lago another shot, though, based on location alone.  This first phase of the East Bank development inspires hope for the future of downtown and the shoreline.  Hopefully, Lago will continue to develop it's identity and offerings to match it's surroundings."}
{"text":"Some vendors took us here for drinks and dinner, and I was not disappointed. Cocktails were tasty and the staff was very friendly (one waitress forgot my drink, but we did have a large party so all is forgiven).

I wish I could remember what we had, but we were hosted to their largest tasting menu that consisted of some absurd number of plates. It felt like 15 plates, I really have no clue. Each one was very good however. The wait staff serving the food were very attentive and always made sure drinks were refilled and explained every plate. They were also cognizant of any dietary restrictions we had and made sure everyone was taken care of.

If you have a chance, take a seat on the patio. It is situation right behind the famous Bellagio fountains and gives you a different view of the fountain show. Quite majestic. Just hope it's not a windy day or else you'll get a nice rain shower :)"}
{"text":"I hope this is the Lago Restaurant at Bellagio Hotel.
I ate there with my wife and was totally disappointed. The ambiance was fine. The waiter gave us our menus and when I told him that there was nothing on the menu that i liked he insisted there was something and tried to coerce me into eating something I was not comfortable with. 
My wife all the while was uncomfortable with me. So I forced myself to choose something. I chose a scallopini dish. It reminded me of a quip about a noveau restaurant, where the customer was asked \"how did you find your steak\" whereupon he replied \"I shifted a string bean and by golly there it was! There were three thin slices of meat and the price was high. 
I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Decent at best.   Went there for an office lunch and was underwhelmed.  Service was not good for our table and the portions were tiny.  My entree literally came in the same bowl that my soup came in and I thought that was small!   With so many good places at Bellagio I can't imagine coming here again."}
{"text":"Great menu, fresh all around. Drinks are kinda pricey, but they don't disappoint. Try the \"pata negra\"! The panini sandwiches are top of the town."}

{"text":"Best view of the Bellagio fountains.  Very enjoyable evening. Delicious small plates to try and share.  The short ribs were falling off the bone.  The pizza was light and crispy.  One pound bone in rib eye was amazing.  Oysters on the half shell were crazy good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. While the service was good, it was very rushed. I felt like they were just trying to turn tables. The waiter seemed to be moving fast fast fast. $50 corkage fee at the Bellagio. We had to send the scallops back because they had no Sear on them."}
{"text":"This was our first meal upon arriving in Vegas and it was such a treat!   Every single thing we ordered was delicious.  We started with a summer squash soup that was creamy and flavorful.  Next was the farrow salad which you could tell had very high quality olive oil on it.   The roasted vegetables in the salad were just right.  We then had the goat cheese and fig pizza and it was perfection.  Finally, we had two pasta dishes - the lamb and the lobster. The lamb pasta was so great.  The little pieces of lamb were not gamey at all and tucked neatly inside the corkscrew pasta.  And the lobster pasta was beautiful, like a work of art.  You could tell both pastas were made in-house with love.  Our only regret is not making it to dessert."}
{"text":"This restaurant was good, but honestly nothing exceptional. I know it is tapas style, but be prepared to drop some serious cash to get a full meal. Although what I ate (Cesar salad, brisket cannelloni, and some type of chocolate mousse dessert) were all very good, I received a meal that was far more delicious and filling from yardbird for half the price, so overall you can find places to be way more satisfied for what you get and what you pay. The one redeeming thing was that it overlooks the fountains and strip which is nice."}
{"text":"No complaints about the food or the atmosphere here, both were impressive and great for our planned party of 14. The service, however, was the complete opposite. Our server, Rene R. actually seemed to be trying to give us poor service and was focused on turning the table quickly instead of creating a great experience. 

He didn't ask for drink orders before the food order, some members of our party were never asked if they wanted a beverage at all. I ordered a glass of red wine after being rudely rushed through the process. Ten minutes later, I asked if I could receive the glass of wine I had ordered, and I was brought a glass of white wine instead. At this point, it had been about 20 minutes, so I just decided to drink it. 

While ordering food, we shared who from the party would be sharing a tab. At the end of our meal (after never being asked about how our food was tasting or if we needed anything else), we received one check. When we requested it be split up as we had requested, we were told \"I guess, but it will take me 30 minutes\". 

At that point, we reached out to the manager to share our experience. No apology, no trying to make it better. He just shared he would help calculate so it might get done quicker. 

Totally ruined our experience, and we would definitely never return."}
{"text":"Always a nice experience here whether on a date or with a large group.  Their red sauce is killer good. And I contend their meatballs are the best restaurant meatballs I have had in a long time.  Service can be a little slow during peak hours."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I had the braised beef and several appetizers. I will say that the potatoes that come with the dish do not taste very good. You are better off getting the loaded baked potato."}
{"text":"On our stay at the Bellaggio last week, we again enjoyed two fabulous meals at Lago. Sit at the bar with Emiear (Irish Em) who won our hearts last year. She offers fabulous menu suggestions and always makes us feel so special. The four meaty melt-in-your-mouth ribs were enjoyed each night. The veal piccata is so flavorful and tender... the sauce just delicious. We also had the seafood pasta... a winner. Caesar salad is just the right size for two. And the lemon meranque dessert is just the right end to a gourmet small bites adventure. Em and the food are always a must for us when we stay at the Bel."}
{"text":"I've been there for brunch twice & loved every bit of it! Amazing service, Roxeanne stood out in particular & the manager even stopped by our table to ensure we were having a seamless experience. Love the bottomless drinks special (mimosas, Bellini, Bloody Mary) & all courses I've had were cooked to perfection. Wonderful buffet style dessert with a chocolate fountain & cotton candy! Not to mention all with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous fountain-side table for two. Late February temps were warm enough that, with the heaters, dining was comfortable. We did get spritzed a little during very active songs. Food was pretty good, service was impeccable, setting made the night. Indoor seating was very loud so we were glad to have the intimate outdoor setting. The 7&7 gnocchi was delicious. Filet mignon was perfect. Cannelloni with short rib had well prepared pasta but the filling was mush. Margherita pizza was a perfect appetizer size. It's all tapas sized unless you choose a main, but those are also encouraged for sharing. Cocktail prices are consistent with Strip prices. Wine choices include a few good values, considering..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vibe and the decor at Lago. I went with a group of 12 and it was a perfect place for a bite to eat before beginning the night. It is mostly tapas there so be prepared to order a lot of small plates to share. Honestly, it was a little over priced for the quality of food. I did enjoy the caprese salad but I probably would not bring my husband here. It is a better spot for a girls night out!"}
{"text":"Chef Julian Serrano has done it again! The food is excellent and service of course is wonderful.

The tables on the patio are my favorite spot to enjoy a glass of prosecco, grilled octopus and watch the Bellagio fountain show! I have lived here for 5 years and the view just never gets old.

Also be sure to try the potato gnocchi. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is THE VIEW.  Nice servers but horrible service; waiting 20 minutes for a weak drink is not ideal. We were there for Sunday Brunch, I had the Salmon Salad and Lasagna which were good, but nothing special.  Overall, I would not recommend or go back!"}
{"text":"Lago is by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in Vegas. The good was amazing and so full of flavor. I would highly recommend the fave, octopus with squid ink coos coos, the meatballs (which literally melt in your mouth) and the thin sliced tuna topped with the sweetest mandarin oranges. Finally the Amalfi dessert is a must. I've literally never had anything better than Lago. I am definitely visiting regularly here. ALSO, try and get Nader as your waiter! He is an amazing waiter and is so helpful, nice, and comforting! The food portions are small but 5 plates and 1 dessert should be enough to fill up 2 people. My total was not as high as I expected as well and Nader also said the dessert was on him for my girlfriends birthday which is why we went. 100% must if you are able to go. Don't miss out on the best Italian in Las Vegas and the best that I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Oh wow, it was amazing. First off, the view is amazing -- the restaurant is situated such that it overlooks the Bellagio fountains, head-on. There's an outdoor seating section and unfortunately we were seated right next to the door and it often got stuck - not a lot of people bothered to close it, so we had the summer heat constantly blowing on us.

Absolutely make a reservation before you come here, I think I saw them turning people away in front of me. 

We started with the caprese - absolutely delicious, but I'm probably biased because this is one of my favorite all time dishes. The dishes come out one at a time, by the time you've finished one they're usually pretty good about making sure the next one has already been placed on you time (if not the next 2).

Highly, highly recommend the burrata, we also had the cold cuts plater (because who doesn't love some dried meats?).  As far as pastas, we ordered linguine al pesto, gnocchi alla romana, funghi trifolati, and agnolotti di vitello. Other dishes ordered were polpette di carne and capasanta alla putanesca (scallops). My favorite dish was hands down the gnocchi alla romana - tasted like butter and the texture was fantastic. In all honesty, I would order any and all of the pastas again. 

I am absolutely planning to come back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and so delicious. All of the food we got here was delicious but my favorite was the gnocchi. The ambiance was amazing as well and I loved being able to watch the shows as they went on. The wait staff was really nice as well and the service was great. The dishes came out quick and piping hot each time and they were always checking in on us. They were quick to do refills as well which I love. The only thing that was annoying is the fact that they will not seat you until the minute they open otherwise I would definitely come back. They were so good. They are very expensive though but the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"For a restaurant of this fame, it tasted very normal. Didn't enjoy my dinner at all. Ambience was very good and be sure to ask for table by the window for Bellagio fountain view."}
{"text":"It's difficult to have a better lunch elsewhere.  Very difficult. 

I don't believe Lago is for those seeking buffet size portions or trying to find familiar dishes.   Lago is a perfect example of a restaurant for those who are willing to be taken on a short but exceptional and memorable culinary journey.  

Octopus in a spicy tomato sauce saved us the airfare to the region of Italy where this dish has been perfected.   

Sea bas with olives, capers, tomatoes, asparagus should be on the menu forever.  The dish deconstructed:  crispy skin, yet moist sea bass filet, sweetness of tomatoes diminished by the right amount of salt, asparagus moist yet slightly firm.   Wish I could order another dish. 

I asked the chef to come to the table so I could thank him in person."}
{"text":"What a fantastic surprise!  We were afraid we wouldn't find anyplace open for a later-than-expected dinner and were ready to settle for almost anything.  Fortunately, Lago was serving dinner late.  This was really a wonderful meal.  Starting with the huge Salerno Family Meatballs as an appetizer, we found that they were just like Grandmom used to make and were blanketed with a delightfully tasty and sweet tomato sauce.  The pasta entrees were themselves worth writing a special 5-star Yelp review.  I loved the Tortelloni stuffed with veal and accompanied by proscuitto, sweet peas, and a parmesan cream. Six stars for the Tortelloni.   My colleague had Rigatoni with sweet sausage, fennel, and escarole.  Normally cherry tomato with aglio e olio is added, but the chef was very accommodating in using a marinara sauce instead.  The desserts topped off the perfect meal.  Two scoops of luscious raspberry sorbet for my colleague and an interestingly delicious panna cotta with poppy seeds, strawberries, and a sweet rhubarb sauce.  Our very enthusiastic and wonderfully pleasant server Danielle couldn't have done a better job making our experience at Lago any nicer.  Hopefully, we are able to return to Cleveland and Lago again very soon."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a group of 5 and we were honestly disappointed by both the food and the service. For such an acclaimed restaurant, we really expected better. When we first arrived, we had to wait 10 minutes for our table to be prepared, despite having a reservation. Throughout the meal, servers kept asking to take our plates even when we weren't finished, creating a very rushed atmosphere. 

For the food, the only dish that stood out was the ahi tuna. Be warned that the portions are very small. They say that it's \"tapas\" style, but some the dishes are difficult to share. They're not tapas, they're just small. 

I ordered the lamb ragu pasta, which luckily was filling, but the taste was fairly average. At Lago's price point, I was really expecting to be wowed. I also ordered the tiramisu for dessert. It was beautifully presented and tasty, though not astounding. 

Overall, if you're looking for a fancy dinner on the Strip, I would look else where. Even the views are only really spectacular if you're seated close to a window."}
{"text":"Lago by Julian Serrano is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I had one of the best experiences in my life, my girlfriends and I went there to celebrate my birthday on Sunday's Brunch. Memorable beautiful fountain views, and fun and satisfying dishes.

Upon being seated at the lounge we started with glass of champagne and amazing pastry basket brought to our table.  The restaurant had customized the menu to read HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRISCILA !!! How thoughtful is that and the hospitality is mind blowing. 
We each were able to select our own 1 & 2 course. We got the:
 Shredded Salmon Salad, Duck & Polenta, Raviolone, the Filettino and EggPlant Parmesan Benedict. Everything were very delicious! 
After finished eating we seated at patio to drink our mimosas and bellinis, and have dessert. 
They wrote 'Happy Birthday' on the side of the dessert plate. I think they went beyond their job to make sure we have a great time.  

The dessert bar was self serve and they had: tiramisu, Nutella Crepe, Panettone Pudding & Fruit Salad, and chocolate fountain with marshmallows, strawberries, brownies, Rice Krispies. 

 In addition, the service was amazing, the bartender and server Monique were great. Monique was the one that set everything up she was beyond with outstand service, she did incredible job very helpful, knows the menu, attentive to our needs and with a beautiful smile that kept us feel welcomed....The gourmet food decor was nothing short of excellent! 

I can't wait to return at a later date for dinner!!!

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AT LAGO, and SPECIAL THANK YOU TO GM Albert Najem and Monique."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  The restaurant is all hype.  The food was poor.  My husband got sick from the food there and the manager did nothing."}
{"text":"By FAR the worst restaurant in Bellagio. Very loud, cold cuts were not fresh & the pasta wasn't good. I will give them credit, the wine was good & when I complained they comped the meal.  Grateful that they made it right."}
{"text":"Brunch Review

We had a 10:30am reservation on a Sunday for brunch. We were seated on the outside patio.

The hostess was very nice. Remembered us and sat us right away.

Food and drink:
Mac Carbonara - 3 stars - nothing wrong with the dish but also nothing special about it. Would order it again
Raviolone - 4 stars - as you cut into the ravioli the egg flowed out in a beautiful liquid pool.  The pasta was perfectly al dente. The sauce was very rich and a little heavy handed. I would do more of a drizzle of the sauce.
Italian Sausage Fried Egg Burger - 2 stars - overcooked a bit
EggPlant Parmesan Benedict - 2 stars - no flavor
Peach Bellini - 2 stars - just ok.  
Bloody Mary - 3 stars - this is from a Bloody Mary critic though.  Could use worcestershire, celery salt and horseradish.  Added garnishes of pickle peppers and a bacon strip would be lovely.

Service - 1 star
Ricky was our server. He was very nice however seemed a bit frazzled. My drink did not come out for quite a while however they did end up comping it. We have been there for an hour and only had one course and of the three course brunch. We stayed another 15 minutes and then left as we had a plane to catch.  We asked several time for our next course but it did not come until we were literally getting out of our chairs.  We were charged for the entire brunch.  

Ambiance - 3 stars
This restaurant has a bit of a modern vibe. The music was club music which was a bit much for brunch so minus one start. We really enjoyed the view from the patio and watching the fountains was amazing.

The food was just mediocre and the service was not good.  There is much room for improvement.  I would not recommend this restaurant for brunch.  Very disappointing give that it is in the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Went for thanksgiving dinner and we had tonno crudo, chicken liver crostini, pistachio salmon and duck and polenta. It was all delicious! Surprisingly, the chicken liver crostini was very memorable. Plus the views of the fountains every 20 minutes were beautiful and entertaining. We passed by the lounge just besides Lago, named Hyde, and it also had unbeatable views of the center strip and bellagio fountains. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"First time visiting Lago and I was extremely impressed on how delicous and so authentic tasting my dinner was. The service was also fabulous. To start we prosecco and a cucumber drink which i highly recommend. We started with shareable appetizers: BRUSCHETTA AL POMODORO, RAVIOLI AI GAMBERI & CANNELLONI. The CANNELLONI was ok, the texture wasn't my favorite. I had the OSSO BUCO as my main entree."}
{"text":"5/26/17 Dinner after the \"O\" slow at Lago..wow the decor, music is so cool...they arranged for a nice cozy booth that gave us an awesome view of the fountains of Bellagio..Jennifer our server was really fantastic and her suggestions were super good... Carpacchio, gnocchi, veal raviolli, osso bucco were all fantastic, and to finish giandujutto waa heaven..all the food was less than out bottle of Stag's Leap Artemis.....I would definitely say to give this place a try when at Bellagio..."}
{"text":"I got a pick a place to eat at for a company sponsored dinner and Lago had been a place I have wanted to try it for so long.

I made a reservation a week before and we were sat almost immediately upon arrival. We got a really nice seat, two tables from the window. We picked a time where the fountain shows were just starting so we got to see a beautiful show every 15 minutes.

The service was not the best I have ever had. I felt like our waiter paid more attention to the table next to mine. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so I kinda expected better service. We waited for a water refill for a long time.

The food however made up for the service. We had to try the small plates so we had a few of those along with one regular dinner plate. The Gnocchi with lobster is a must. The lobster was delicious, and the Gnocchi was one of the best Gnocchis I have ever had. The veal was a little too sour for my taste, so next time I will pass on that. We also had one of the sashimi plates, which was melt in your mouth. A little pricey, but delicious. Finally, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and I really enjoyed that dish.

The plates were small, but full of flavor. I think ordering a few small plates and one side is the perfect amount of food for two people. 

The meal was quite pricey, but with the beautiful restaurant, the wonderful view, and the high quality food I will definitely be back for more some day. It was a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to bring some friends."}
{"text":"The food itself was good when it finally arrived. The server was kind but not terribly efficient. The dessert was comped because the wrong risotto order was placed (red wine vs seafood). The food again was delicious but then when the check arrived it was completely wrong and ended up waiting literally an hour for it to be corrected. While the food was good and the view amazing will likely not be returning because of the poor service and experience."}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and I came here for the amazing views.  The food was amazing. Dessert is to die for. And the waiter Antonio is so kind and warm he makes you feel right at home. I love this place and will be back for sure. Everything is an A+ the resturant is bright romantic and very clean. I couldn't have had a better experience. You have to come try this place at least once."}
{"text":"How this place does not have 5 stars is mind boggling. Yes the food is expensive but it's literally overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the quality of food is prepared top notch with only the finest ingredients. I have never had a more tender and flavorful short rib. It wouldn't even stick to the fork it was so soft! You can't go wrong ordering anything here and don't forget to try the desserts you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"It's the morning after and I'm still ridiculously excited about getting to come here on opening night! 

My only options for reservations were 5:15 and 9:45. I took the earlier one and am so glad I did. Despite the opening night jitters the staff seemed to be experiencing, the service was im-pe-cca-ble. I know they'd had three nights to practice on the crème de la crème fortunate enough to attend one of the \"soft openings\", but they said that it was different now that it's \"real\". :)

Also ridiculously, I can boast that I was the first customer to order the Lago cocktail, the one with the edible flower suspended in an ice sphere and sprinkled with glitter. It is a visual masterpiece and obviously, someone put a lot of thought into developing it. I felt a little guilty when I asked if the bartender would be willing to use Nolet's gin instead of the vodka in the original recipe. S/he was, and our server told us they'd run out to another bar to get it. 

We ordered: the seafood wrapped in other seafood with limoncello, the sausage/gorgonzola toast, the canneloni stuffed with short ribs, the langostinos, the filet with gorgonzola, and the shrimp ravioli.

Now for the \"feedback\" part:

~All very good, though the sauce on the ravioli was extremely salty (didn't prevent us from just scraping it off and mowing down on the pasta itself) . We did mention it to the server.

~Some (ok, maybe most) will find the portions skimpy. Prices are what you can expect - similar to places like Jaleo, Giada, Rose. Rabbit. Lie., etc. You know, the ubiquitous small-plates joints.

~Just to make it easy on the bartenders, if the spirit is on the menu, there should be a bottle of it at the bar...I still feel badly that someone had to run out for the Nolet's. 


Overall, a wonderful experience! The food was plated beautifully and presented with enthusiasm. It is good. It is also (so far) probably just on par with the offerings of other elegant strip dining establishments. Chef Serrano is one of the best, and maybe I'm just partial to his namesake restaurant in Aria, but Lago at this point is a little, well, average. It distinguishes itself mainly for decor, ambiance, and service. I 

My 4-star review notwithstanding, it's ¡Ridiculously exciting!"}
{"text":"This review is not for their dinning in but for the room service that Lago provides for Hote Aflot. 

It is by far the worst room service ever!! This review comes after a month of frustration and dealing  with them during my stay in Cleveland. Most of their pastas are mediocore. I dont know why others have gievn them great review. 

But here is the real thing when you call them to place an order for room service more often than not the person taking the order knows absolutely nothing about the dish.If you ask a question he/she will put you on hold and run to chef to ask. Everytime!! Meanwhile you are holding the phone for quite sometime before she gets back and then you ask something else and off she goes to the chef.. SO by then you decide not to ask them anything and move along. 

Yesterday I ordered Tuna which comes with a side of chips. I said I dont want the chips can I get some vegetables or something else insead. She said sure- chef's vegetables, and I get charged $6  extra for the vegetables  (5 pieces of Brocollini)wh . I cal the manager but he is busy so I am holding the line. then I am told the manager will call me back. Half hour passes by he never calls. so I called back. 

Finally he takes of the charges for the vegetables. but what sucks is that at any other restaurant if you dont want chips or fries they give you something, even if it is a few baby carrots they aways give you something else instead of chips!! Just as a nice gesture. Here I paid for the full portion and if I did not want to get chips its my loss!! 

And by the way I've tried their chips before they are bad!! No more roomservice from Lago!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 2.5 stars.

I both live and work in the Flats and know all the restaurants here well.  Although I liked this place the first time I came (which is why it's getting three and not two starts), it is definitely not one of my favorites.

My first dinner experience here in November was great.  Our table (of four) shared the brie as an appetizer and we all really enjoyed that, although I just checked and it doesn't look like it's on the menu anymore.  I had a sangria to start and was so-so on it - I didn't hate it, but I doubt I would order it again.  My husband and I then split either a salad with tomatoes and burrata (not currently on the menu either), and despite the cheese overload, really loved that too.  For dinner I had the lobster gnocchi and thought it was really good.  We had wine with dinner and there was a good selection of bottles (I don't recall how the by-the-glass selection was).

The next time we came for dinner in January I was not super impressed.  We had the raclette to start (also not on the current menu), which was good, but way too much for just two of us.  While I debated going with the lobster gnocchi a second time (I wish I had...) I went with the scallops, which were prepared differently then.  They were SO salty I contemplated sending them back.  I didn't because I didn't want to be \"that\" person, so I guess I only have myself to blame.  Anyway, service was so-so that time, so overall it (literally and figuratively) left a bad taste in my mouth.

Finally, a couple weeks ago I got lunch here to go - and this was strike two.  I ordered a pick two combo and got the caprese sandwich and kale salad.  The caprese sandwich really wasn't that bad, it was just strange... I swear it was served on Texas toast, which is just so odd.  Do they not have focaccia?  Or something else that doesn't look like a fifth grader's lunch?  Also, I swear they used canned tomatoes.  I get that tomatoes are not in season right now, but maybe that means this shouldn't be on the menu?  As for the salad - I do not eat meat so I asked for it without pancetta.  The bartender rang it in properly (it showed up \"no pancetta\" on the receipt), but I guess someone wasn't paying attention in the kitchen.  Sure enough, it had plenty of pancetta in it, which I didn't realize until I made it back to my office.  Luckily I work in the EY Tower, so I called down and asked them to remake it, which they graciously did.

I will give this place one more shot, so at this point I wouldn't recommend NOT going here, but I also think there are better options in the Flats."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends. The service was excellent. We had a decent view of the fountains. My friend said the lamb chops were quite possibly the best he's had. He eats at lots of upscale places as well. The sommelier provided excellent advice on a wine pairing as well. It's a great place to go on a nice, romantic date. It's pricey, but on par with other like restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lago has an awesome Happy Hour, Monday - Friday from 5 - 8pm. 1/2 off all drinks including shots of top shelf. Stop by and have a drink or two."}
{"text":"Almost a 5. Really great spot very classy atmosphere the food tremendous we had the pizza the charcuterie Caesar salads and pasta and minestrone all were excellent. Service was great will be returning"}
{"text":"Mother's Day brunch awesome! The view overlooking the \"Fountains on Lake Bellagio\" just adds to the suburb menu selections inspired by \"Julian Serrano\". From being greeted as we walked in to be served by Roxanne a very lovely experience. As being a local it rates as a top choice!"}
{"text":"Largo was great for us for lunch twice. Small plates which are perfectly executed and very fresh. It's the perfect place for lunch overlooking the fountains. You can eat inside or out but make sure it's not too hot out or you will be sweating. Seafood, pastas, meats salads adorn the menu. They even have a pre fix lunch menu. There's something for everyone on the menu, even pizza.
It's very good."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch for a business meeting. Wonderful ambiance! We came in because I had heard there was a great prix fixe menu for lunch. Unfortunately it was not available. (I'm still not sure of the reason)

Ordered the branzino. The fish was great, perfect lunch portion! The bartender Derick made our day! So friendly, attentive & pleasant! Would definitely come back again for that lunch prix fixe menu. *hint hint*"}
{"text":"This was a splurge meal on a girls' weekend in Vegas. What a great last dinner with my friends! We were seated by the windows with a lovely view of the fountains. After dinner, we realized the place to be next time would be the patio area so that one could hear the music synchronized with the fountains. I liked the house music in the interior, and it didn't bother me that it was not synchronized. 

Service was excellent. Waiter was on top of selections and my allergies. 

Had a lovely glass of wine and shared three tapas dishes (with two other friends) plenty of food. Would like dessert options that would be dairy-free and chocolate-free. 

Very swanky bar. Nice decor in this Bellagio restaurant. Clean bathroom."}
{"text":"My husband and I went during our recent trip. Everything was perfect. The service,  the food (especially the red wine risotto and tuna with orange segments), the room, and the view. One of the you meals that I have had."}
{"text":"Amazing view of the famous fountain from any table in the restaurant!  It had been open only couple weeks when I visited.  Tapas-like concept was very good.  Lots of interesting small plates for sharing.  Some were excellent (e.g., octopus), but some missed the mark.  Service was excellent.  Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the fountains are beautiful! We came with a group of 14 girls for a bacherlotte party. My best advice is to order about 2 plates per person - one pasta and one meat/seafood. I've heard the wine is good too.

Gnocchi Alla - 4/5 - very creamy cheese taste that melts in your mouth. 6 of them were a bit rich for me. This tapas is best to be shared with another person.

Shrimp stuffed ravioli - 3/5 - mini shrimp were fresh but the marina sauce overwhelmed me a bit.

Clams in white wine sauce - 5/5 - my favorite dish of the night. A huge bowl of clams steeped in white wine and butter paired with thick spicy Texas toast  bread, with a kick. I could eat this dish all day long.


I also got a taste of the cannoli's, chicken liver and veal stuffed ravioli - all excellent.
Overall, service is quite good and the fountains provide a great view.

Don't miss Lago when you are in vegas but expect to spend at least $40-$50 per person."}
{"text":"You know how whenever people eat food on TV, they seem to overreact about how delicious the food is? They moan and groan and smile and close their eyes while savoring the food. I always thought it was just for TV, but Lago managed to evoke those emotions out of me. Wow.

I went with three friends during CES weekend right when it opened for the day. While they set up our table, we waited near the front of the restaurant in this lounge-ish area; that was pretty cool and hip. The restaurant decor was very clean and modern. Each table has a simple metal vase of fresh flowers; I thought it was a nice touch. Tables have a marble finish, so they're great for the instagram background LOL! They definitely put a lot of attention to detail in the presentation of the place; when we refreshed our plates, the server made sure all the logos on the plates faced you instead of randomly placing the plate onto our table. And since I went for lunch, there was plenty of light streaming through the windows facing the fountains. 

For drinks, we got the \"mojito passione\" and \"rose and rye\". Presentation was SO ON POINT. The mint leaves of the mojito were even gold dusted! My friend and I did think that the drinks were pretty strong, The server did mention \"rose and rye\" was his favorite.

For food, we decided to go with the tasting menu. The food is tapas style, and they had a lot of options, so I'm glad we had the chef do all the menu picking for us. They ask if there are any allergies to be aware of. And then you just sit back and wait for the best food journey of your life. 

They bring out two dishes at a time. NOTABLES WERE: the bistecca (as part of the surf and turf), lobster gnocchi, and the burrata dish. That sauce for the steak was SO BOMB. After my first bite of meat, I had the biggest grin on my face. And even as I'm writing this review, the memory of it is bringing a smile to my face. The lobster gnocchi sauce tasted very similar to lobster bisque, and we all loved it! The biggest letdown was the pasta dish with truffle; it was just okay. The other dishes were a blur, so good thing I took pictures of them! haha

Our subtotal came out to be 406 for 4 people. We ordered two drinks and a dessert in addition to the tasting menu. Our server was great, and they even refreshed our plates halfway through the meal.

TL;DR This is undoubtedly a pricey place.  But for the food, the ambiance, the view, the service--and let's be real, we're on the strip in Bellagio, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Saturday, February 03, 2018

Date night sent us here. We were unsure about the place at the beginning but the hostess made us feel welcome and comfortable right from the beginning as she lead us to one of the best tables in the house. Our window seat with a view of the world famous Bellagio Fountain and the Paris Hotel was very impressive. 

Not being totally familiar with the tapas style of dining, our waiter easily, politely and throughly walked us through the process. After cruising the wine list, we ordered our wine with the sommelier who broke the ice and wine ordering business when the cork broke in the bottle we ordered. We all got a good laugh out of that. Oh, and the Pinot Noir was an excellent choice.

We ordered a little bit of everything...tapas style. Cold seafood, pasta, more seafood, meatballs and desert. No complaints whatsoever. None.

The couple sitting next to us was celebrating a birthday and we offered to take their picture with the incredible view behind them. They reciprocated taking our picture. Fine people from Toronto they were.

We hated to leave Lago but if you go, this is a dress-up place for ladies and gentlemen. This is also not a cheap place but, you will get great food, beverage, atmosphere that is incomparable and service that is really commensurate with the costs. This was a great experience."}
{"text":"Made a reservation online 3 days before, and gave them a call to request a table outdoor/patio.

TIP: Table outdoors are not guaranteed because it is first come first serve basis. You can do a guaranteed table outdoor for $200 per person.

End up getting to sit inside because there was a private party outside. Sat by the window which is nice too cause we were in the middle and the room was not crowded. There were only 3 other large party.

We did Sunday brunch for $38 per person. Select 2 course on the menu and dessert is also included. Worth the money because it's pretty filling. They put out a \"happy birthday\" note with different desserts on a plate with a candle at the end for somebody's birthday.

You can also do All you can drink for $28 per person (Mimosas, Bellini, Bloody Mary)

We had Alessandro as our server and he was really nice.

I recommend this place for a good brunch for a good price and service as well as atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our dinner here turned out to be a disappointment and sort of soured our mood.  We did give the manager our feedback and he patiently listened and wound up discounting our bill.  For that, I'll give 3 stars.  The food was quite fine, but  the hostess and front-of-house service was lacking.  They simply don't communicate well and follow-up with reservations in a timely manner.

We made Open Table reservations at 630pm and didn't get seated until around 715pm.  A nice table by the windows to see Bellagio water shows wasn't available and would be 10-20 minutes wait.  Instead they had a hightop with stools available.  So we waited for a nicer table but after 20 minutes it was going to be another 15-20 minutes.  We wound up taking a table near the bar with no view.  Guess making reservations isn't useful here since they don't understand the concept of putting a reserved sign near the good seats.  If its first come first serve, why bother to accept reservations at all and keep our hopes up?

As for the food, the best dish was the Grilled Octopus with squid-ink couscous. Definitely a masterpiece with char-griled tender octopus and savory, briny couscous - it gave us both black lipgloss but was totally worth it.  The 7x7 (7 gnocchi and 7 lobster knuckles) was also good - with a nice buttery broth.

The other two dishes were mediocre.  Chittara and clams was cooked al dente but seemed a tad on the salty side.  The Branzino had a nice flavor and seasoning on the tomatoes but the fish itself was a bit under-seasoned.  

Our waitress was very nice but she forgot our crab farro salad and then didn't give us a pen when we asked for the check.  The busboys were great at refilling our waters and clearing the plates - so they probably deserve the best praise with respect to service.

The manager did discount our bill, which was honorable and a welcome gesture.  Still, with the fierce competition in Vegas for restaurants its doubtful we will return."}
{"text":"We came here with friends for a \"special occasion\" dinner. We arrived at 6:15 for a 7 PM reservation requesting a patio or window table. They called us at about 6:40 that a window table was available. No patio table would be open for another hour. We took our window table.
Ambiance: The decorating is dramatic to say the least. From the moment you pass the hostess stand until you reach the floor to ceiling glass wall facing the fountains, each area of the restaurant is striking. Definitely 5 stars for the ambiance except for the noise level. Some people like the \"high energy, high noise\" dining experience. Not me.
Food: Our server recommended 3 to 4 small plates per person. We opted for two small plates and one main course per couple. Good choice. Way more than enough food. We started with a pizza, fusillioro, mushrooms and the \"7&7\" as appetizers. The pizza was excellent despite the fact that it was served just slightly warmer than room temperature. The Fusillioro is a corkscrew pasta dish with lamb ragu and spuma di ricotta. This was my favorite dish of the night! The 7&7 is potato gnocchi and lobster knuckles. Another excellent dish. The mushroom dish was the only disappointment of the night. Bland and flavorless. The main course we chose was the Pesce Intero. This is a whole boneless white fish served with a generous portion of vegetables. A really outstanding dish with very high presentation quality. Yumm!
Service: The only major disappointment of the evening. Our server was at our table fairly quickly. But then disappeared for long stretches. We asked to have the pizza served first. Instead, all 4 appetizers appeared at once (considering that the pizza was just about room temperature, I suspect it was ready much earlier). With all 4 appetizers being presented at once, our fairly small table became very crowded and hard to navigate. Our water glasses spent most of the evening near empty. I just about had to tackle a passing busboy to get them refilled once. They sat empty the rest of the night after that.
Value: The presentation and taste of the food was really memorable, but the noise level and the mediocre service make this not worth the $75 a head that it cost. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The service there was OK, nothing that impressive, drinks too way to long, took about 30 mins to get to us from ordering at our table.  

Food: Our appetizer was the meatballs and you get 3 huge meatballs, so it is great for sharing for 2. Very tasty and real delicious. For dinner, I had the Gnocchi and it was amazing! Definitively if I go back, I will get this again. My better half had the vegetable ravioli and that wasn't that great, not much of a taste to it.

All in all: We will try this place again, because they had a wedding party and were dealing with a lot of people."}
{"text":"Lago is definitely a solid choice for anyone coming to Vegas and staying at Bellagio.  View is fantastic, and the food is really good.  I wish I could give 4.5 stars and not just 4, but the pricing is a little high for what you get, in my opinion, but I guess you can chalk that up to just being in Vegas.  Service has always been decent, but my one gripe on that is that the servers seem to always be pushing you to order more, rather than asking.  Guess I'm nit picking a bit, but it's the little things that differentiate in my opinion from a 5 star establishment.  Still would suggest people make the stop, as I have always been satisfied here!"}
{"text":"Lago is a chic restaurant space with modern decor and some excellent view seating but the wait time and overall arrogant service were disappointing, which explains my one star review. 

I called ahead and made a reservation 24 hours in advance for a birthday celebration dinner. Based on open table, they had plenty of reservation times available during peak and off peak dinner hours for Friday night. It is also advertised on open table that this is a restaurant good for large groups and celebrations. 

When I called the concierge to book my appointment, he asked many questions such as any specific dietary restrictions, are we celebrating anything, would we like a seat with a view of the fountain, etc. I mentioned yes, we have one vegetarian, we are celebrating a birthday, and yes we would love a view of the fountain. The concierge stated there are vegetarian options, he would note that we are celebrating a birthday, and that we should arrive 15minutes before our reservation time so we can get a seat with a view of the fountain. Making the reservation was painless and based on all the Q and A, I felt like Lago would be an enjoyable experience.

Our entire party arrived at the restaurant at 8:45pm for our 9pm reservation. I actually had to wait at the maitre d stand as there were several groups in front of us so by the time we checked in, it was 8:55pm. I believe the owner was the host that night, based on yelp pictures of restaurant owner. He was not welcoming at all, he and the women staff around him did not smile or acknowledge us with a greeting. It was the most uncomfortable and standoffish restaurant check in I've ever experienced. 

The host/owner mentioned we could be seated immediately or wait 20minutes for a seat with a view. We agreed to wait for the view seating since that would be part of the dining experience at Lago. He said ok you're checked in, but did not give any information as to how we would be contacted. I had to ask how will we know when our table is ready? He mentioned that he would let me know, that I should stay around the area. Most restaurants with this kind of traffic and updated technology give you a beeper or text you when your table is ready. That might be something this restaurant can take into consideration since it is a popular foodie destination.

There was no waiting area so I sat at a slot machine chair directly in front of the maitre d stand in candid view of the host. By 9:15pm, my friends were restless and annoyed that we were waiting for a table even with an advanced reservation. I approached the maitre d stand and the host/owner with a very nonchalant demeanor stated, oh your table is ready, is your entire party here? Wow!! I had been sitting directly in front of the maitre d stand for 15minutes and he never bothered to inform me that our table it ready. We were led to a table with a great view of the lago and fountain show, but it was probably not even our table as it was set up for a party of 9. Another party must have been tired of waiting and left before getting seated.

The food is hit or miss, some of the vegetarian dishes were tasty and executed well but the bistecca was tough and chewy, not a good quality piece of meat for a high end restaurant. We also ordered the lobster gnocchi based on all the positive reviews but it didn't impress. 

Consistent with the service from the host/owner, our server was aloof and unwelcoming. For the birthday celebration, they put a candle in a dessert that we ordered off the menu and had to pay for. The execution of the dessert presentation was untimely and unorganized, they didn't even ask who's birthday it is and brought out the lit dessert and placed it in front of my friend who ordered it, not the birthday person who actually went to the restroom at the time. 

If you're willing to overlook the awful service, wait time, and hit or miss food, you may enjoy the view and decor of this restaurant. For us, it was consistently disappointing and we will never dine here again, even with our free M life rewards."}
{"text":"We had brunch here. The food did not justify the price. I had the duck polenta, which my server recommended over my other choice. It was really too salty, I should have returned it. And overly rich. The 2nd course I chose was the eggplant benedict. It really didn't have that much flavor, the eggplant were soggy, even though they were fried and I had to ask for marinara sauce to make it taste better. I would absolutely not come here again!! I WOULD recommend the little patisserie place at the Bellagio where they had yummy nutella crepes that hit the spot. (They also have savory crepes, we just didn't try them)"}
{"text":"The review can't wait until I leave. 5 stars simply won't cut it. I've just had the best steak of my life. Service was impeccable - tailored to our needs. We booked with about 30 min in advance but were able to get a fountain view table. Come here if you enjoy excellent food, atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"If you are going to Vegas and want a nice Italian dinner with almost no children then this is the place to go! Since it is located in the Bellagio hotel, it is set to overlook the water show with a great view of the Paris Eiffel Tower. The pesto was fantastic! The Caprese appetizer is also tasty but a little too much Basil for this dish. The portions are small but shareable and the wine selection is only semi-diverse. The waiters have good knowledge on wine/drink pairings if you are overwhelmed by the drinks menu. Overall it was a nice experience with a stunning view!"}
{"text":"The view you can enjoy in LAGO is very beautiful. Usually there is a show every 10 minutes?so you can see at lease 3 show. Better to have a window seat?The food are good too."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the unique view and ambiance of Lago on Saturday night but found there to be few vegetarian options to choose from. I had margarita pizza which was a bit over done. They claim to be tapas style but my friend and I had our own meals. I noted my friend's birthday was coming up and our server was kind enough to bring out a desert on the house. Overall service was good. 

I would return but likely not for the food just drinks. It is conveniently next to Hyde if you plan to make your way there after as the promoters refuse to leave you alone on the way to Lago."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon salad $18 fairly small plate but delicious.  Ordered the garlic bread $5 but it was more like 4 skinny flat pieces of toast.   Beautiful view and great service. Beer $9 a glass.  Pretty pricey lunch"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great ambiance! This place was a great way to end our trip thanks Lagos for a great time. Our server was also phenomenal"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant.  Service was mediocre, but that's acceptable given the short time it's been open. However, the food, especially for the price, was extremely underwhelming. Portions were tiny, even for tapas. After discussing the restaurant with the Bellagio staff, they said they have heard similar feedback.  I'm surprised that reviews have been  mostly positive. Desert was enjoyable,  best part of the meal.

Note to servers- At $15 to $20 a cocktail,  don't come and grab patrons' drinks without asking. Our unfinished drinks were grabbed without asking if we were done."}
{"text":"Arrived an hour early and asked if they could accommodate us early and they let us right in and gave us the best seat in the house that gave us an amazing view of the water show!! Everything we ordered came out super quick and was all perfectly cooked. The waiter was very professional and friendly. Would definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, meat and fish only have 4 pieces!!!  WTF. Also, no servers to help us at very beginning. So bad"}
{"text":"Had a lovely pre-O dinner at Lago last month when we were visiting Vegas.  Everything from the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains to the top notch service left us feeling full and completely satisfied.  Since we had a group of 6, we were able to try a wide variety of the menu.  It's one of those meals where you try so many things, it's hard for any (or many) items to stand out, and to be fair, many of the items were pretty basic but enhanced by the grandness and atmosphere of an elegant Vegas restaurant.  That said, if you're looking for a great restaurant that appeals to a group of people with a nice view and on the Strip, Lago is a pretty reasonable option for both great tastes, tons of variety, and pretty reasonable price points.

Bruschetta al Pomodoro - perfectly crispy bruschetta that was seasoned well with the right amount of pomodoro topping, nothing memorable but a great starter and a classic
Salmon Crudo - when I'm not pregnant, I will go back just to try every plate of crudo they have, but even being able to sample some of the salmon was enough for me that evening.  Fresh fresh fish, lightly accented with caper and delicious
Branzino - probably one of my favorite items of the night, perfectly prepared and delicately flavored
Meatballs - can't go wrong here, nothing standout, but still delish
Braised Short Rib - a group pleaser 
Baby Shrimp in White Wine Sauce - Delicate and tasty but not super memorable
Mushroom Risotto - a nice heavier compliment to add some starch, not overly salty as some risotto can get
Malloredos - pork sausage pasta that was quite tasty and an excellent choice
There was a green pasta that I can't remember the name of but was very enjoyable as well
Filettino - excellent cut of meat, prepared well

Overall a very enjoyable meal.  Definitely fits the Vegas standard of grand atmosphere and service.  The food is excellent, you can't go wrong.  You may not dream about the items later and you may not taste a flavor you've never experienced but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Enjoying the view and fountains while aggressive lounging! Can't wait to come back and try a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Julian Serrano 's food is always amazing!!
A specially he's Japanese Wagyu Ribeye is
OMG!!!!!!! Soooo good
YummmmmmNever had this kind Beef
It was Amazing 
You should try he's Ribeye Wagyu beef!!
You will be love it"}
{"text":"Lago was a great way for a party of 8 to experience a variety of different food.  I'm a longtime fan of tapas but have never had an Italian take on it before.

We tried to order a variety of food items.  Everything was really delicious!  Trust me, everything was excellent (including the view), but for being touted as this amazing place, it didn't have that spark, that pop that I was looking for.  Yes, all of the food was fantastic and I'd totally come back, but it didn't have the... I don't know, innovation that I had when I was dining at, say, Jaleo.  Still, I'd definitely recommend Lago to people, especially those who love Italian food and want a good view of the Bellagio fountains."}
{"text":"Review is for Sunday brunch Nov 26/17
Stayed at hotel. Came down at 10:30 for first seating. I had reservation My grades. A=Excellent, F=fail

1. Hostess Greeting: F
2. Server: Antonio -A
3. Food: A
4. Drinks: C

Overall grade: F.   Will not return

While the food is good and wait staff is efficient and friendly. Initial encounter was so off putting, it really ruins the Sunday brunch experience. 

We had reservation for first seating at 10:30 and arrived a few minuted early. Yet we were told thete is no table. We were herded to the bar. 
After 5 minutes bar tender looked at us, proceeded to fill his ice bucket. After another 5 minutes elapsed, he asked if we wanted to get started with cocktails......not exactly we thoughg privately at 10:30 am on on empty stomach. He left us.

15 minutes into our wait, hostess came over called out my name. I and my husband stood up. She looked at me and said. \"No it's not you.\" Then proceeded to invite another party to their table. My husband saw my name on the tag hostess was holding. I walked up and told her, she's perhaps mistaken. She said \"No. Not you\". I went to the 2 hostesses at the door and asked why. They confirmed to the first hostess that indeed, we are the correct party. She turned, glared at us and walked us to our table Not one word like \" follow me\" or anything. We sat down. She left. That was it. No, good morning, how are you, apologies for the mix up. Nada. 

Our server Antonio was superb. He remembered my food allergies from my reservation. Asked the chef to recook the steak & eggs.

Two points for management:
1. Either retrain hostess or get rid of her. Poor customer interaction skills turn away customers. The sunday Brunch is as much about the experience as it is about the food. Hitting 50% of the mark is failure on the fiercely competitive Strip.
2. If you need to boost the bar tabs, make the drinks exceptional. Do NOT force customers to the bar for a 1st seating brunch. If you are truly logistically challenged, at least train bar tenter to offer a glass of water while guests have to wait for you to sort out your scheduling logistics and not push alcohol first thing am.  Feels like a fundamental failure on logistics management, which is both shocking and a huge disappointment for an establishment of Bellagio caliber."}
{"text":"A very modern, almost cartoonish in decor, Italian restaurant in Bellagio with a great view of the fountains (but no music).  The downside of the decor is that the restaurant is really loud, so no intimate conversations here!

We enjoyed our meal and went for the tapas menu.  Everything was great.  I especially enjoyed the malloreddos pasta.  What was crazy was that the next day, a version of the dish was being served at the Bellagio buffet!  That did not stop me from eating it again.  

Super service."}
{"text":"Personally this place lacks a vibe, can't put my finger on it. My food wasn't good either...I got the panini and it had soggy weird chicken on it that I think made me ill. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Lago is located inside the Bellagio hotel and it was very good.

Very nice view of the water show and very open setting and the servers were very good.

We had tapas style and all of them were very good and it's worth the high price."}
{"text":"Great lighting. Great selection and generous pour on the martinis .

The bartenders are nice even though their uniforms look like Isaac from the love boat wore them in the 70s."}
{"text":"Horribly disappointed in our first (and last) visit to Lago!  Our reservation was for 7:15 -we were barely acknowledged at the hostess station and told to go have a drink in the bar/ someone would be by to get us in a few minutes. A few minutes? At 7:45 we still weren't seated and when I went back to the hostesses, all three of them stood at the podium staring at their table maps discussing amongst themselves what to do.  Again, no one gave me a definitive answer, and we were again told to go wait in he bar some more. At 8pm I went back again to the hostesses and said 'this is not right! What is the purpose of having a reservation if you have no plan to seat us? We have show tickets and will likely miss the first part because we haven't even been sated for dinner!'   I was ushered back to the bar by a manager who bought us a round of drinks (small consolation just to shut me up no doubt)  We were finally seated and had a 15 minute dinner so we could get to our show. 

As far as dinner goes, tiny plates- order several if you don't want to leave hungry.  No bread served unless you specifically ask for it.  Didn't have a chance to get dessert or appetizers because we were in such a rush. With so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, we won't be back to Lago- they completely missed the mark and didn't really seem to care."}
{"text":"5 stars for service, 4.5 stars for food.

We had 15 people in our group, and our waiter was outstanding.  I give him so much credit for keeping up with us.  Sure, there were a few snafus, but overall, it was perfect.  Not to mention that they created a special prix fixe menu for our party.  Just wow.

The food:

Beef Carpaccio: The BF said it was like eating beef flavored air.  So light, yet oh-so-flavorful.  4/5

Charcuterie Plate: The only disappointment of the evening.  It came with salami, prosciutto, and one other meat, provolone and mozzarella cheese, olives, mushrooms, and artichoke.  Good, but not special.  The charcuterie across the street at Lolita is much better.  3/5

House Salad- Awesome dressing, but otherwise not memorable.  3/5

Caesar Salad- Very memorable.  They serve it as a romaine wedge instead of chopped up. The dressing has a nice kick to it.  Also, there are actual anchovies in the dish, which is pretty rare to see.  5/5

Lamb Chops- I had mine served without the pumpkin gratin, due to a dairy intolerance, and they happily substituted some asparagus for me.  While the lamb chops were quite good, I think the magic of the dish would have been much better with the pumpkin gratin.  This is obviously no fault of the chef's!  4/5

Veal Short Ribs- Seriously out of this world.  The veal and the parsnip puree somehow compliment each other to make a flavor explosion.  Definitely the star of the evening.   5/5

The only gripe of the evening was that some dishes had small portion sizes.  Someone else in my party ordered the chicken dish, and it was seriously itty-bitty.  The salads were small, too.  The good news is, you aren't likely to be disappointed with any of the food, though!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal during our Vegas weekend. We sat outside on a sunny Sunday morning and watched the water show while we dined. The waiter was patient and let us sit for 2 hours even though it was the middle of the busy brunch time. One of my courses was overcooked (the sausage and egg sandwich) but all other courses and desserts were good.  Plus I think the bill was reasonable considering we had bottomless mimosas and blood marys as well as plenty of sweets. The ambiance feels like a relaxing European breakfast.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Officially found myself my new brunch spot! Everything from start to finish was flawless, I can't wait to try more. Donovan was my server and recommended the raw ahi tuna crudo- The fish was so fresh!!! Very high quality. For my second course I had the eggplant Parmesan Benedict which was also very tasty. The dessert display at the end was the cherry on top of a perfect, flavorful but not over filling meal. There were several items but I went straight to the chocolate fountain with marshmallows and strawberries. Oh. My. God. The manager Albert stopped by at the end and showed us the gorgeous patio, he was extremely friendly and inviting. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is amazing, the host Sheyda is the reason our valentine's day dinner was perfect. Everything who works in service should be like her. We checked in early for our reservation to wait for a table by the fountain, we were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes. We were seated in 25 minutes, but our table was right in front of the huge pillar, which made waiting for a window table pointless. We asked if we could have the table next to us, our host Sheyda went to check with the manager and came back and told us the hotel had reserved it. Then 10 minutes later she came back and told us she had appealed to the manager again and was moving us to the better table because we had waited for a table with a nice view. Sheyda didn't have to ask again, but she did and it's definitely the one thing that made the night extra special"}
{"text":"Our fourth time here, and this time during hectic super bowl! Truly a pleasure. The most pleasant professional staff that just lets you chill out how you wish. All the dishes are delicious , but we always settle on a medley of apps and a flatbread.
We highly recommend Lago for a full meal or an afternoon break."}
{"text":"This was the most money I've paid to be under impressed in a long time. Great service. They are too proud of their chef to justify the $150 we spent on lunch for two. After lunch at Lago, I needed to go get some food.

I'll try a different place next time..."}
{"text":"The caprese salad was delicious, as was the pork sausage pasta. Delicious vegetables like the mushrooms. The roasted potatoes were cooked too long and needed a drizzle of olive oil as they were dry. The pesto pasta was creamy and delicious. Great views of Las Vegas, nothing else beats it in town."}
{"text":"Really great quality Italian tapas ! Took about 20 min to be seated even with reservations so highly recommend making one since this place is busy!!

7 x 7 gnocchi 5/5 - favorite dish of the evening. Gnocchi melts in your mouth along with lobster
Filet mignon 1/5 - did not like the blue cheese on top of it and scraped it off
Margarita pizza 3/5 - tasted like a normal puzza"}
{"text":"Found Lago while looking for a nice dinner in Vegas...the style of the restaurant is Italian tapas, so 5-6 plates are recommended between 2. The restaurant isn't cheap, but their food is excellent!! Especially recommend the red wine risotto and the veal pasta! The only negative I could find for the food is probably just me...I felt the focaccia would have been better if there was salt on the focaccia before the ricotta & honey was added-it still tasted great though!

Request a table near the windows to have an incredible view of the bellagio fountains!"}
{"text":"I come here for the baked mushroom cavatelli and am never disappointed. Tonight was no exception. The ambiance and selection is always wonderful, as well, but tonight, the rest of the food was not. The veggies on our pizza were not cooked all the way and the server seemed a bit off: it took a long time to get our drinks but our food was out in minutes. Weird. Overall, too expensive for what it is, and the construction and light rail make even the ambiance a bit weak."}
{"text":"I took my nephew here to dinner, it was wonderful. Jennifer was our waiter, she was amazing. Food was great, we loved it."}
{"text":"I love the lobster gnocchi, amazing!!!!!! ( when they make it the right way) sometimes when I go here, it doesn't taste as good. Their service and quality isn't consistent. One of my favorite restraints... the bar tender with long ombré hair is always extremely rude. One time she forgot my drinks for 20 min, ended up getting everything for free."}
{"text":"Had the best drinks tonight served by a humble, but highly skilled bartender.  My friend wanted something particular and he offered to make an unique drink to hit the right spot.  When he returned, it smelled amazing and tasted better than it smelled.  

Beyond the special treatment. We had great food and a great selection of Italian wines.

Thanks lago for an awesome time!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.  Started off a caesar and ended with a panini.  I forget if it was called porchetta panini.. the bread was delicious as were the meat and sauce.  Service was attentive and prompt.. 
I would def go back next time im in vegas."}
{"text":"Went to Lago for the first time tonight- went since we heard they had a vegetarian menu for Mondays.  We aren't vegetarian all the time, but Monday's are an exception.  
To start we had the polenta with goat cheese and the poached pear salad.  The polenta was great- the cake itself was somewhat bland and the portion was a little too large for an app- but still delicious.  The poached pear salad was great- wish it came with more gorganzola though.  
For entrees we had the veggie gnocchi and pappardelle- yum!  Highlights of the evening- gnocchi (veggie- not the lobster) were pillowy and very satisfying for a vegetarian entree.  The papparedelle was rustic and hearty- very simple dish.
The dessert is why I gave Lago a 4- we ordered the apple tart with zabaione off the vegetarian menu.  It was obviously reheated because the apples were cooked to complete mush.  They tried to resurrect it by placing fresh vanilla zabaione (with fresh vanilla- yum!) as a sauce.  Unfortunately this was the last thing we tasted and it didn't leave us with a great memory.  Hopefully the memory will be repaired with the leftovers of the gnocchi and papparedelle for tomorrows lunch :)"}
{"text":"My first visit to this yummy restaurant bar prior to the Cirque show.   Found it delightful.   The wait staff is dressed up and that was a nice surprise.  The food is served \"small portion\" style so it is fun to order several dishes for the table and share a little of everything.  Gluten Free pasta is available with a promise of GF pizza in the future.   Very lovely -- will be back."}
{"text":"Came solely for midday drinks. Located in bellagio overlooking the fountain. I didn't see the option to have your drink in a pineapple cup so kindly asked the bartender. I was able to get any drink from the menu put in there. It's about 3 drinks worth in one cup, deal! The rosso bellini was light and refreshing. The raspberry wasn't overpowering. The bartender was attentive and courteous throughout our time there."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. Much better options at the Bellagio or near by. Save your money and spend elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for Restaurant week for my awesome 3 course meal with each course being the regular full size from their menu.  I started with the Cauliflower:
caramelized garlic, chili, herbs, Parmesan. It was a whole head of cauliflower fried up and flavored to the best I've ever had and was able to take some home.  For course 2 I got Beef Short Rib: carrot, celery root and potato purée, gorgonzola and apple salad, blood orange chili sauce.  Soooo tender and tasty and again big enough I got to eat the rest for lunch the next day.  I finished the meal with Panna Cotta.  While delicious I could not eat more than half since i was super stuffed and sadly that is not something that can be taken home.  Very happy with my meal and the service, just wish the atmosphere was a bit more lively even though it was a Monday night.  Only two other tables were filled and a few people sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"I visited Lago for a Yelp Elite Party.  We got there early so we sat at the bar for a quick bite and a drink.

Das Mann was impressed with the wine selection.  \"Very Comprehensive\" were his words.  I like wine, but generally know nothing about it (aside from, I like it, I don't like it) and I usually let him make the selections.

I ordered a salad and it was quite delicious.  

I was not overly excited about the decore of the place, and wouldn't come back for the ambiance.  

Service was ok.

Menu looks good, I'd go back and try it for a full meal sometime."}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing, but those bottomless mimosas hit the spot! And Adam the manager had The music on point!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. We did not get our outside seating from the reservations we made. The food was not good, we had four different plates ranging from the pizza, meatballs, and veal ravioli. Each plate just was not up to par especially for the prices. We had a bottle of wine $80 that was the best part of the meal. Also the tables in the restaurant are all too close to one another, you can hear everyone's conversations there is no privacy."}
{"text":"Best duck I have ever had! Absolutely amazing amazing amazing!! The pizza was spectacular also. Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining in Bellagio and we will certainly be returning. We were seated right in front of the large window overlooking the fountains, which was a real treat!

Our waiter was very polite and attentive and gave me great suggestions when I was undecided on a dish. My husband got the Osso Buco while I got two of the smaller dishes so I could sample; the braised duck and seafood risotto. All of the food was superb, but the duck with creamy polenta won my taste buds and heart. Even our drinks looked like works of art.

For dessert we had the tiramisu and the vanilla bean panna cotta with citrus. It was like being back in Italy. 

I can't wait to return next year."}
{"text":"I like the vibe here. Someone took time to figure out that the dark reds and other colors make it feel warm and inviting - the kind of place where you can get caugjt up in a good conversation and spend more time than you planned. The scallops and lobster gnocchi seem to be the stars of the menu and neither disappoints.

I loved the chill music and the energy of the place feels relaxed. If this eternal winter ever ends, there's an outdoor patio that sounds like it would be a good springtime spot. 

If I could change one thing about this place, i would add some couches in the corner - that way, I could  spend some serious time here.  If I have another night in Cleveland anytime soon, I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a great view of the water show. Maybe one of the best meals I had during my 4+ days on the strip.

I had the four cheese lasagna. It was so tasty! I just wished it had came with a side of green veggies or something. Entrees do not come with sides (this includes salad). Cost were reasonable here; I just didn't want to pay much for lunch.

I also had the smoked peach martini, which was really tasty. My drink was around $15. The other drinks on the menu looked great. Many ladies in my group ordered the cucumber refresher.

Decor was nice for any occasion. I would come back here."}
{"text":"Food is really good, however you should check the price charged for your meal against what the price says on the menu.
We ate there in February and after looking at the check, we realized the prices were higher than what was on the menu.
We spoke to the assistant manager and she apologized and said she would correct it in the computer. I just wonder how many customers were over charged and didn't realize it. We're not talking a dollar or two, but 5 or 6 per dish."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants I've been to on the strip. The cocktails are great and reasonably priced. Expect to pay a decent amount for dinner as they are all small plates. Make sure to ask to sit outside to get a view of the Bellagio water show. The shrimp ravioli was good, as well as the clams. We got the pata negra meat plate as an app"}
{"text":"I was so exicted to dine here for my birthday, but we did not get the chance. We stood at the hostess stand as one employee spoke to another customer for a few minutes. She could have aknowledged us with eye contact but we remained patient as she was busy. Two hostesses walked up to the desk which we were now standing directly in front of and did not even look at us. They stood there chatting and looking at their seating plan. Finally after a few more minutes I said loudly to my husband \"Are we invisible? Maybe we just seat ourselves here!\". We laughed, but they STILL did not look up. Finally, a male employee joined behind them and one woman looked up and said hello to us.
We said party of 4. She asked, \"Do you have a reservation?\"  I said no. She said sorry we needed one. I asked if I could call now and make one and she said no they were full as we looked at the empty area to our left. The male employee looked down and said, \"We can seat you in the lounge area now or put you down for 8:45 or 9 pm.\" It was 7:45. We chose to go elsewhere. It would have been one thing if maybe there were a black pants dress code like the night clubs and we were underdressed. I would have understood that. However, we were not even aknowledged. That is just awful customer service. We did not have the opportunity to review the chef's work or the restuarant as we were snubbed at the door. I'm not sure if they were just that poorly trained in service  (which I find unacceptable in a place like Belagio) or if they saw us and our 1 year old and thought if they ignored us long enough we would go away. We took our business to the Palms Restuarant instead at Caesars and enjoyed Surf and Turf and excellent service and hospitality to our daughter. I'd really like to give this restuarant another chance. I will make a reservation as instructed and see if we are aknowledged this time and edit my review if they redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Get a table outside. The view of the Bellagio fountain is incredible! We were worried it would be too cold outside as we went during January, however they have high power heaters above that make it feel naturally comfortable. 

Service was on point and I'd recommend this place for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Everything from the ambiance, to the staff, to the food and drinks is 5 stars. 
Came in on a Sunday night and we were seated by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountain. The waiter was so pleasant and informative. I ordered the pesto pasta with a recommended red wine and it was amazing. The potions are perfect and don't forget to order a side of the rosemary potatoes!
Definitely going back to try more menu options!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome experience. We were able to get a table at a window for the fountain show starting at 8pm. The food was fantastic and the service was on point. We will definitely return on our next venture to Vegas."}
{"text":"Lago is located in the Bellagio Hotel and Casino
We were greeted by the absolutely sweetest, professional hostess ever. Her gracious greeting was welcoming and sincere. We are only sorry we didn't get her name  (She was at the podium at 5 pm Christmas Day) (Olijnyk reservation)
Now to the food; Everything was wonderful. Portions are small.  However, are meant to be shared. So don't expect a big dinner. We ordered 12 items for the four of us. 
Perfect!  Service was impeccable!
We had a window seat, overlooking the fountain. However, everyone in this main area can view the fountain
Our dinning experience was perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner last weekend and this place is amazing. The restaurant is located inside the Bellagio and once seated inside, you have a great view of their fountain show which is super romantic if you're with your significant other. The decor is very upscale and modern, ambience is loud though and it's best that you dress up if you plan to come here. Now let's talk about their food..my boyfriend and I ordered mainly seafood dishes and all of them tasted fresh, rich and delicious. Our server was very helpful as well and he even got me a purse holder for our table which is awesome :) They're a bit pricey here though but I think it's worth it! Definitely coming back next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Had lunch here after looking around Bellagio, I had a Ceaser salad, meatball patty panini and Italian fries.
Fries well good crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The panini was on the dryer side as it need more sauce in the sandwich or a dipping sauce. Salad was ok I've had much salad else where. 
As for the service, I felt I was being ignored as the bartender that was serving me either was too busy ( which the restaurant only had a few table being occupied at the time.) or didn't feel like providing the needed service for his customers."}
{"text":"About as good as a cleaned up version of Olive Garden can be.  Which is why I don't go to Olive Garden.  The four star reviews can only be by people who've never had exceptional Italian.  

On a positive note, the cocktails are as good as the wine is overpriced.  I realize restaurants mark up wines 3X to 4X but there is nothing, absolutely nothing on this menu coming out of this kitchen that merits more than a $100 for a bottle of wine unless the owner is paying."}
{"text":"Recently ate this restaurant for the third time and it consistently under performs.  Food choices are good (and some very good), though quite small and expensive.  Where the restaurant really loses it is the drinks are insanely priced for what feels like half glasses of wine.  On our last visit we ordered multiple $20 glasses of a chianti and it felt like there was about 3 oz of wine in the glass vs normally getting 5 to 6 ounces.  Our last dinner also suffered from the fact that we had no luck in getting some bread - not sure why this was such a challenge. Couldn't help but feel like the lack of bread and the tiny glasses of wine were designed to separate me from as much as my money as possible.  The acoustics in the restaurant are quite bad, so the noise level is a distraction when the restaurant gets full and the people working the host stand seem distracted with things other than their jobs as our \"5 to 10 minute wait\" ended up being over 30 minutes before we were escorted to a mostly empty room in which to dine."}
{"text":"I flew in to Cleveland from Sydney last night on a trip that took 22 hours all up in transit time. By the time I checked into my hotel, it was 11 PM and I was tired, cranky and sore from being cramped into tiny economy class seats for 18 hours.  The only food that didn't require me to move was Lago's late night room service menu (Lago does all of the room service at the Aloft hotel) and being too tired to try and make any decisions at all, I ordered the pizza.

While I will forever vow that New York pizzas are the best, the pizza which arrived pretty quickly was very good indeed. It had a nice crispy base with just the right amount of topping and half of the pizza - because I soon passed out on the bed from exhaustion - actually kept pretty well until I woke up the next day and had it for a very late brunch (still delicious, if not as crispy because I could only reheat it in the hotel microwave).

Definitely want to come here again when I am not jetlagged and can enjoy more of the menu."}
{"text":"Julian Serrano is one of my favorite chefs. One of my favorite restaurants, if not my favorite in Las Vegas is his restaurant Tapas (see my review) at the Aria I believe. When I heard about Lago I had to check it out. I also come from an Italian family so Italian food is very important to me. This is an Italian style causing. It is located in the Bellagio. It's somewhat of a smaller restaurant but it does have a great view. I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time especially if I'm busy evening. My fiancé and I  were there to watch the hockey playoffs just recently. The service is great and the food is delicious. They are smaller portions almost still along the lines of tapas. A little bit on the pricey side but still affordable. The desserts looked delicious but I didn't get any (big regret). This was also not a drinking night for us I'm not sure about the cocktails. However it's a great date date restaurant and I highly recommend this restaurant specifically for the food."}
{"text":"I am SO happy we made a Valentine's Day reservation here! To be honest, I was a little skeptical of it being a \"hotel restaurant\" but once you got in, it felt like a stand-alone place. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. We asked our server for recommendations on both drinks and dessert and he never steered us in the wrong direction! 

We started with the calamari which of everything we ate, I would maybe try something else next time we go but it was still good and different because it wasn't breaded/fried. For entrees, we got the lobster gnocchi and the tortelloni which was stuffed with veal and served in a cream sauce with prosciutto and peas. Both were amazing but the lobster gnocchi was the prize winner! Lots of delicious lobster pieces, tender gnocchi, and a creamy tomato sauce. I couldn't get enough of it! For dessert, we got the chocolate lava cake and also highly recommend. It was served with a raspberry purée and a raspberry sorbet as well which was the best raspberry sorbet I've ever had!

Besides the food and service being wonderful, we really appreciated that this was an accessible fancier restaurant as far as your wallet is concerned. They had a wide range of prices with everything - glasses of wine ranging from $8-$30 a glass, entrees $15-$45, etc. You could go all out if you wanted or keep it a little more budget friendly but either way you would have a classy, delicious dinner experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Lago recently for the first, and most likely last time.   We were  previously frequent guests of Circo which was the restaurant that was in this same spot before the Bellagio closed it to open Lago.  I've also dined several times at Picasso and was looking forward to trying Lago out.  Unfortunately,  the restaurant fell way below expectations.  On the positive,  it's a beautiful space in a great location.  However,  the food was mediocre at best.   The branzino I ordered had a fishy quality and caused me to be ill a few hours after eating it.   The pizza, risotto, and pasta dishes were plain and underwhelming. The restaurant, while pretty, has a VERY chaotic feel to it.   People were constantly getting up,  moving around, and there are a lot of staff moving around a lot too because of the small plate forrmat, dishes are constantly coming and going.  It is also extremely loud.  As a result,  you don't really feel that you're getting any personalized service.   Overall,  the food and dining experience did not come close to the sophistication of the physical space."}
{"text":"I guess I am in the minority on this one but Lago was just alright. This was perhaps the first time as a Yelper that I really couldn't decide on a star rating. After mulling it over, 3 stars seems right, it was just \"OK\".

To start we ordered some cheeses and a couple selections of salumi, which were both average. I would suggest they add a sweet spread of some sort to cheese plates such as a chutney, jam or honey as this helps to round out the salty flavors of the cheese. We ordered the Caesar and chopped salads and both were your run of the mill salads, nothing extraordinary. I was really hoping the main entrees would make up for the average start but sadly that left me wanting more. The star of the meal was definitely the lobster gnocchi with its pillowy gnocchi and chunks of lobster in a cream sauce. The service was very good however a little slow which was odd considering there weren't more than 5 other tables of diners. But as with all new restaurants, these growing pains with get ironed out hopefully sooner than later. For dessert, I chose the coconut macaroon and was really let down, it was really hard (stale maybe?) and after having just one bite decided that was enough. And I NEVER eat just one bite of dessert! Would I go back? Maybe for a glass of wine and appetizer but not for a full meal."}
{"text":"Only went here for drinks and wished we could have done a meal if the drinks are any indication. It was an expensive drink, but worth ever penny!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pate, clams, wagyu beef, and three desserts.
I would totally recommend the clams. It was a little spicy but was so so yummy! The wagyu was okay. The desserts were delicious! Tiramisu was really heavy so if you're gonna order dessert, order this one. The creme brûlée was sooo good but you def need to order another dessert. The cheesecake was okay though, nothing out of this world special. I'd recommend going to Largo at night so you can see he beautiful view!"}
{"text":"Lago Lago this place is beautiful overlooking the Bellagio fountain and Paris.  We almost missed our reservation on Saturday night running late, but they were able hold out reservation for another 15 minutes. Def a busy restaurant, but do you expect for a Saturday night in Las Vegas. We had our seat changed to by side of the window overlooking the side of he fountain. Every tapas dish that came out was absolutely tasteful. The tuna just melted in your mouth. The short ribs were def delicious and worthy of trying. All of the pasta were so yummy! My friend as person entree and loved the steak that she ordered. We were all pleased with each tapas entree. Must try restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Was a beautiful setting.  Being out on the veranda watching the Bellagio Fountains while having a true Italian meal was amazing.  The Caprese salad was a great starter.  The carpaccio was a great starter as well.  Lago, is a small plate restaurant and is just what you need while in Vegas.  You have so many food options, this should be one of them."}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing - one of the best restaurants I have been to in years.  I dine at some of the best places across the country and this one is top notch.   Hostess could have been a little nicer but the bartender, wait staff and management were on their game.  We had perfect seating over the water at the Bellagio!  Great time."}
{"text":"It's super expensive, but that's to be expected. After all, it's a celebrity chef restaurant smack in the middle of the Bellagio, overlooking the fountains. You're going to pay a premium for the privilege of dining there. 

It's a little pretentious. The girls handling hostess and seating duties all had the same color dress and same scowl on their faces, like they were doing us a favor by seating us. Our server was a little cold at first but warmed up to us somewhat once it became clear that we weren't afraid to spend a little-or should I say a lot of money. This is definitely a place where you want to dress up a little. 

The food is Delicious with a capital \"D.\" Most dishes are small plates that come out as they are ready. Our server recommended three per person but our party of 3 got by on 6 plus 2 desserts. Everything we had was well-prepared and pleasing to the eye. 

Despite the little bit of attitude at first, service was very good overall.

We were seated close to the window, which gave us full view of the fountain shows. They were almost an afterthought because we were enjoying the food so much. Lago definitely makes the list of places to revisit next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was Absolutely scrumptious ! The service we received was outstanding between , Becca our server and Adam,and brandon management. Everyone was friendly and informative on food and wine. The pistachio dessert was to die for . Definitely will be back ."}
{"text":"I ran in here with my mother on her birthday just to grab a glass of wine and an appetizer. They let her try a new wine, she loved it and ordered it! She had a \"perfect\" sized appetizer and then they brought her a free tiramisu birthday cake! We were so surprised as we had not asked for it! We loved our server Remy, and thought she made the experience pretty magical."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Bartender Will makes some weak martinis. They were barely cold and he had quite a condescending tone as he charged $90.80 for 4 drinks.  If you are going to charge premium prices then I expect premium service and delicious cold martinis.

We had a great experience here for lunch last year so we returned for dinner with clients but there is too much competition in this town for this amature hour bush league stuff.  

How about a pleasant demeanor?  How about a delicious drink?  

We received neither at Lago."}
{"text":"Hostess - excellent
Busser - excellent
Location - corner table, outside, fountain view, comfy seats, great view
Food - perfect
Dessert - tiramisu delicious, highly recommend it 
Reservation - 5:45 pm 

Server - come on Frank (tall glasses), why so rushed? He basically wasn't happy with out four course food request, plus dessert and a $50 bottle wine. Came back like 4 times for the bill. Why the rush? .... Frank honestly? You were given the BEST section (outdoor fountain view) and... you were so so :( 

Having a so so server at this location is definitely a BAD decision for your business...

$30 dollar tip out of a $140 bill"}
{"text":"We came here for a dinner for two on a Wed. night.  The view was excellent - Bellagio light show in full effect.  That was the best part.  The restaurant is LOUD - as in, I had to almost yell to be heard across our small table.  It isn't because of loud music, it's just the din of everyone talking - everything seems to be hard surfaces and magnifies the noise.  The food was fine but not great.  It's served in small plates, family style, so you can try lots of things but I would say only about 1/3 of the things we got were super tasty (favorite - meatballs, least favorite - branzino and caprese salad).  Nothing was terrible, it just wasn't remarkable.  Our waiter was a bit rushed in his interactions with us, and he also missed ordering one of the items we had asked for.  We had a full meal for two, one glass of wine each, and it was $200 - so pretty pricey too.  Bottom line - I think there are better choices for a couple's dinner with all the other great restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends who just recently moved to Cleveland! We decided on a whim to come here. I was happy about how it happened to be Yelp Eats week -- nothing beats the 50% deal. :)

The atmosphere was really nice -- very romantic and warm. We sat out on the back stone patio which was perfect for a summer evening. They had a nice little climbing flower plant going too.

We shared a calamari which was MMM. The bread was really great with the butter and tomato spread. 

Then, the lobster gnocchi was so rich and fulfilling. Not mindblowing, but good. Plus, we had the 50% off deal. If you're thinking about hitting up Yelp Eats, do it!

One of the best parts was actually the service - 5 stars for that. Like many of the other reviewers, we had the young guy with glasses. He was so polite and came at the right time always!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I had a hard time finding healthier, non-fast good food on the strip. I came here to eat, alone late in the evening and had a great table with a great view over the 'lake', the Paris Hotel and the water shows. The portions are smaller so you can order several different dishes. All were delicious!

The only downside (hence 4 stars vs. 5) was that the room is quite noisy when it is full which was a bit annoying and when I arrived I had to insist on not eating at the bar. The ladies at the entrance I guess did not understand why someone eating alone would want to eat at a table. The quality of both the table service and food made me forget about it! 

My waiter proposed to move me to a table on the terrace for dessert and coffee to enjoy the water fountains and the view over the 'lake'.  A perfect way to end the evening.

I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for some nicer dishes while in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ended up at Lago!
We had never been here.  We sat at the bar, first question, can we watch the football game?  Bartender quickly replied...Hell Yes!  So we stayed.  We had a few more glasses of wine before we ordered some food.  I had a fillet Mignon with some sort of noodle with cheese.  Was out of this world good stuff.  ERK ordered some ravioli with goat cheese, she still talks about how good it was.  I think we had a great time at this place and would be back sooner than later.  Great food, clean, great vibe!"}
{"text":"Had severe food poisoning from their clams. Tasted odd and told them so they took it off of the bill. Called to tell manager of Lago that he had bad clams so that he could make sure that the quality control for other patrons were ok. He stated the clams come in fresh but it happens. Who says this to a customer other than a manager who does not care. Instead wanted to hear that he will do everything in their power to make sure to protect other customers from this happening. Very disappointed. Was here at the Mandalay for the JCK Convention and could not get out of bed for the first 1/2 of day."}
{"text":"El ambiente muy bueno y el servicio también, pedí un mohito en el bar y estaba excelente. Cuando pedí otro en la mesa no sabía igual. Lo devolví. Pedimos. Son buenos platos para compartir tipo tapas, Carpaccio muy bueno. El shrimp ravioli más o menos. La burrata muy fresca y buena. El vitelo muy bueno, y los 3 postres excelentes. Recomendado."}
{"text":"Nice spot for happy hour or dinner.  Parking can be a little tricky in the Flats, especially on the weekends, but there are a few surface lots to pick from and, if you're lucky, you might even find a metered spot.  I had a delicious burger and my friend had a pasta dish.  Both were very good and the service was prompt and friendly.  There are a lot of choices in that part of town now but Lago is certainly on the top of my list!"}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more of this restaurant. The food was very mediocre and nothing particularly wowed me. I had the short ribs, side of mushrooms, stuffed squid, and Langostino's. Everything tasted rather bland. I definitely don't mind spending a pretty dollar for a fantastic meal. However, I found this particular meal to be rather boring.Looking forward to trying other fine dining spots on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Well Lago was a suggestion from searching \"best views of the Bellagio fountains\".  Boy it wasn't a disappointment, only downside was there was only seating available at high tops near the casino, and not with a view.   Which was very surprising since it seemed very slow.  I ordered a whiskey and ginger, the soda was flat, but was not a big deal at all.  Just ordered another one.  

We ordered clams, filet, and a platter of different meats with bread.  Everything was cooked perfectly, very bold vibrant flavors.  The tapas style menu really allows you to try many different things.  

I will be sure to come back, and make reservations with a view this time!"}
{"text":"Had an odd experience at Lago. The food was \"pretty good\" but not great. Nothing was bad. We did the tasting menu. Salad was mediocre. Caprese was pretty good. The best thing we had was the crudo, with a variety of raw fish. The pasta course had some good dishes (risotto) and some that weren't so good (lobster gnocchi). The meat course was the least impressive. Mediocre beef, pasta with way too much truffle (no idea why this was part of the meat course, anyway).

The real downside was the service. The waitstaff was VERY aggressive when leaving and taking plates, bumping everyone at the table, elbowing, had food spilled on me twice with no apology. Also, the sommelier was incredibly aggressive. After our dinner host opted not to order more bottles of wine, the somm came back again and seemed sort of put off, asking again about more wine, and when he was told again we didn't want a FOURTH bottle, he went to the opposite end of the table and sort of rudely put the wine list in front of individuals asking if anybody wanted glasses of wine. Very offputting. Not professional."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the flats amazing food and service! Allie and Ariel are the best servers, their amazing I love them !"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend from Washington, DC to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. We had dinner here before heading out for a night of celebration - I opted for the beef short rib. 

While eating, I was less than impressed with the flavor profile. I thought maybe it was because I am spoiled by the DC restaurant scene - I only completed half of the meal. Within an hour of consuming the meal, I realized I had food poisoning. I was violently ill for the next eight hours, had to pass on celebrating my friend's birthday that I came into town for and instead spent it with my head in the toilet. 

It is interesting to read some of the other reviews stating that Lago has a very high amount of health code violations - not surprised. 

Additionally, my friend's husband had a pizza with some of the same meat on it (much smaller amount than my meal). He suffered from some of the same symptoms on a less severe level as mine. 

Just my experience, eat at your own risk.

{"text":"So glad that they're open for lunch now.  I loved the freshness of the food and the ambience.  

As requested we were seated inside by the window (overlooking the lake).  

We had...
Pellegrino
Seafood Salad - julienned veggies sauted perfectly and mixed with fresh steamed seafood. Delish!!!
Butternut Squash Soup with Spicy croutons - Delicious!!!!
Salmone - Fresh and Delicious!
Margherita Pizza - Fresh, Light and Crispy.

Everything was fresh and tasted great!  I love that the portions aren't huge and you don't fill up on one item.  My husband and I shared the food and are looking forward to our next trip to Vegas and Lago!"}
{"text":"We came here for our date night while visiting Las Vegas. The view of the fountain was awesome and the staff was friendly. We order the Lago cocktail which was amazing. For food we had the 7&7 and the 8oz filet. The steak was a bit disappointing but the 7&7 was pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the good ratings. Clearly we need to educate our people. Service was terrible! The host was flat out rude when we asked if it's possible to get a table by the window with the view and the waiter tried to clear up our table without asking wether or not we were done with our food."}
{"text":"Worst experience in Vegas. Front desk ladies spent 20 min to let me know that I made a wrong choice to chose their restaurant. Never see so bad service in Vegas. Shame !"}
{"text":"All we can say is WOW! Excellent, delicate food. Go there for lunch and get prix fixe for $28 (3 course). Same size dishes as for dinner. We dined here twice for dinner and once for lunch during our week trip. Everything we ordered was superb. Special highlights - seafood salad, Sea bass, panacotta with citrus. Lobster risotto, soup, bay shrimp, salmon, hamachi carpaccio. We tried all desserts, except the cannelloni. Will come here again whenever we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Lago is located in Bellagio and in front of the famous Bellagio fountain. Since it is in front of the fountain, the view is nice. I think it will be better to go to the restaurant during the daytime rather than the nighttime becuase of the view and scenery. 
Overall, food were great, but food quantities were only a few. Maybe we ordered food that had small quantities, and it was lunchtime. I was not quite full. But the taste was very delicious. 
I had Agnolotti Pasta, which only came out four pieces. But it was really good. It is definitely recomendable."}
{"text":"This place was a nice find for us.

We were walking around Bellagio looking for a place to eat and Lago seemed to be the only place open for lunch on their side of the casino.

The restaurant didn't look too impressive from where we stood at the hostess desk, and I didn't understand why they were taking us outside as it was kind of cool that day and then....Hello great view!!!!

Overlooking the \"lake\" and looking at the fake Eiffel Tower was fantastic and put us in a very good mood.

We ordered the following:

Arugula salad:  fantastic
Veal ravioli:  excellent
Chicken parmesan panini:  Terrible/bland; trust me, don't order it

Our waiter was very attentive

This will be one of our \"go to\" spots the next time we're in town"}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday dinner (total 6 of us) - I figured it would be good since it was in the Bellagio. Good does not even come close this place was amazing! First off do yourself a favor and sip on one of their signature cocktails before dinner. We got a table by the glass and we could see the fountains. I recommend getting a reservation. There is so much to choose from it can be overwhelming. The waiter told us about the Chefs Tasting Menu and we did that - basically picked the top things for us. My favorites were the Beef Carpaccio and the Sashimi. There are a lot of choices in Vegas but for real try this place!"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because of the positive reviews. My daughter is getting married and this was the celebration dinner. Our waitress explained that they were very small portions that we would want to order 6 or more items. She explained that we could continue to order as needed. Very small portions does not begin to explain how small!!! Very expensive and not once did our waitress even attempt to come back to the table. They hurriedly brought our food and picked the plates up and we were out of there in less than 30 minutes. Not because we wanted to be! They never even gave us a chance to order more. It was like they wanted to use our table or something.  Not a pleasant experience at all! We really didn't even get enough to say if the food was good or bad."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I ate dinner here during a convention stay and, to me, this was the best meal of the trip despite the crazy décor on the walls.  Each of the items are meant to be shared - we each had a salad and split a selection of ribs, sausage pizza, lamb chops, and basal pesto pasta with a couple of vegetables.  Each was very good but the lamb chops and pasta were outstanding.  Great and attentive service, with a nice view of the fountains while they were doing their display.  Pricing was reasonable on a per plate basis for Strip comparisons, and with one cocktail and a glass of wine the ticket was right at $200.  If you are staying at or near the Bellagio, I would recommend you to give this place a try."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots for a nice simple lunch or dinner, especially if you sit out in the terrace on a nice day.  The tapas style plates with an italian flare make this spot unique and worth a visit.  Food is very good and the setting is great.  Best use of the location and a far upgrade from the previous Circo."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour until 8:00pm weekdays.  Great food."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has an average of 4 stars.   Worst meal in Vegas.  I think I may have had 4 strips of pasta in my dish and the marinara sauce tasted like Campbell's soup!   Awful! And Expensive!"}
{"text":"The staff at Lago are so rude and care less about customer service. They sit walk ins at the bar and refuse to accommodate even though the entire restaurant is empty. The food is horrible and only went there once and liked the ambiance. But if they refuse to accommodate for dinner you would be better off anywhere else. No reason to spend a high-priced dinner to eat at the bar."}
{"text":"Lago at Bellagio is incredible! The food, the staff are amazing! Monique was our server, she was very good, walk us through  our experience in a way just her can do!!! Bottomless is the way to do it for brunch! The view is incredible!!! Thanks Lago and Monique for the incredible brunch!!"}
{"text":"We went to Lago awhile back for our last dinner in Vegas before flying home. It was fairly new at the time, but I didn't find the food particularly memorable, in fact when I looked back at the pictures I had taken, I barely remembered that my friend and I had split a pizza. 

We had the scallop appetizer, a margherita pizza, seafood risotto, and spaghetti chittara. While everything tasted good, it wasn't \"wow,\" and I felt no urge to go back. I know it's the Bellagio, so it's going to be overpriced, but to me the food wasn't worth the price. The view was something impressive though. I finally saw the fountain show for the first time, and up close too since the restaurant borders the \"lake.\""}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner reservations for a girlfriend's bachelorette. Great location--was able to see the Bellagio fountains through the floor to ceiling windows. Service was good. I thought the waitresses' blue outfits looked odd--it reminded me of Fifth Element. Overall, food was presented well and tasted delicious. There was a big group of us and we ended up ordering different entrees to share family meal style. We all loved the potato gnocchi and short ribs. Only problem is that the entrees were served tapas style, aka really good expensive food that can feed a small picky child.  Costed us about $600, and though food tasted great, we found ourselves still hungry. For $600, that's definitely not a good feeling you want to have after leaving a restaurant. Definitely not the place to go if you really want to eat. Stock up on snacks before hand if you really insist on coming here."}
{"text":"Wonderful!

Pleasant server, food was great, portion sizes perfect. 

Go here as apposed to the other places."}
{"text":"Asked for a fountain-facing view with my reservation and had a wonderful seat. Service was prompt, informative, and friendly. The food was excellent. It is tapas style though there are entree-sized meals available as well. Highly recommend for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Clams with bucatini was the BEST! Caprese salad was presented differently and interesting. Pappardelle pasta was okay in favor but chewy, great pasta. Cheesecake and flan desserts were delicious. View of the water show was a nice touch to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great, new place to have a special dinner in Las Vegas.
While the Belagio hotel and casino is nicely decorated, the bright blue and white decor of Lago is nice and refreshing. 
We arrived early for our reservation and were seated out on the enclosed patio. It's a great place to sit. You miss the excitement of the main room, but it's nice.
We started with the Fegatini di Pollo, the chicken liver crostini - toasted bread. It was the hit of the night. Also, Tonno Crudo di Pesce, Ahi tuna with orange segments. Delicious. A pasta di Pesce, 7 & 7, the potato and lobster plate was another hit. The Impepata di Cozze, PEI mussels were plump and juicy, about the best mussels we've had.
Deserts were just perfect, little cannolis and panna cada was absolutely delicious. 
Carlos gave us great service.
Of course, a great room, a creative executive chef, good food well-prepared and well-served might all be for naught without high-class service from support waitstaff. We got that from Elmer. He made sure to warm up the coffee cup before bringing it to the table.
However, the best example of the type of service provided at Lago occurred at the next table over. When the diner requested fresh garlic with her sea bass entree, she was told the chef had none. But in just a few minutes, about the time it took to run over to one of the nearby Belagio restaurants, staff delivered a small bowl of the requested, chopped garlic! Promptly laden onto the Bass.
We look forward to a return visit to Lago. Hopefully, we'll be lucky to have Carlos and Elmer give us their excellent service."}
{"text":"How I wish one didn't have to walk through the stupid Bellagio casino to get to Lago. But wow, once you're seated..

This is spectacular, inventive food, a menu you'll want to return to 3-4 times in order to cover everything you'll want. And oh yeah the fountains perform (just for you) while you dine. 

If your parents come to visit, take them here.

Menu highlights include the absolute best dish I've eaten in 2015, the Polpo e Fregola al Nero.  It's two octopus steaks, perfectly seared with olive oil, squid ink and tiny Sardinian semolina balls - oh my goodness - we must all be doing something right in life to deserve to eat like this..

And the lamb ragu fusillioro, and the chicken liver crostini, and the scallop crudo... 

I'm done typing - I'm headed back there now, I'll eat by myself at the bar tonight."}
{"text":"Top notch menu, wine and service. Rich, almost exotic Italian dishes in tapas format. Very good wine list."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas beginning of October and Lago was perfection! Thank you Karlyn for taking such great care of my cousin and I! She made our dining experience so enjoyable and comfortable. With the dietary restrictions I have, she made sure everything I ordered would be prepared perfectly safe and I cannot thank her enough for that! We went twice and asked to sit in her section because she was the sweetest and kindest! The food was very delicious thank you Chef! Can't wait to go back in two weeks!"}
{"text":"I came here for some appetizers and a glass of wine. You cannot beat being in Vegas, at the fabulous Bellagio and having a glass of wine and appetizers while looking at the Bellagio fountain show. I cannot wait to come back here.! And my waiter lis simply phenomenal, amazing, and fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Was not a fan. Maybe we caught this restaurant on a bad day/time (it was indeed around 10 pm when we went for dinner) but the food looked and tasted very mediocre (seemed almost homemade and not in good way). I tried many dishes here, including the meatballs, caesar salad, a pasta dish and a honey bread type dish. Nothing tasted particularly fresh. This would've been okay had the bill not totaled  around $120$ because the quality, size (small tapas) and presentation of the food was not even worth half of that amount. I don't mind paying for food when it is high quality but I do have to say that this restaurant in terribly overpriced. However, given the direct view to the famous Bellagio fountain, I would perhaps recommend this place for a drink or two.. but thats it."}
{"text":"Great food , ambience. Amazing views from the restaurant. Food was delicious . We were there for our anniversary dinner , will definitely dine here when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best lunch ever in Las Vegas. Service was amazing Monique  our server was outstanding. Great suggestions and so fun to chat with. She made the experience over the top. 
Thanks for the Top class service. 
We'll be back Bravo"}
{"text":"I'm teetering back and forth here... not sure whether to give Lago 4 or 5 stars so let's just say 4.5, shall we? (Uggh, I sound so serious). 

I rarely, if ever, choose to eat at Italian restaurants. Reason being, I eat far too much Italian food at home. BUT (!!!) -- I was really impressed with Lago. 

Service was pretty darn wonderful. The staff went out of their way to acommodate us. We had a pretty large group of about 16/17 --- I didn't count. I was too distracted with the lovely company and the wine I was drinking. They set us up in the Carriage House with the tables arranged in a big square. What a neat idea! We were all able to see each other and hold conversations with every person in attendance. Nice touch! I was also glad that I could personally thank our server and shake his hand at the end of the evening for putting up with us. 

The food --
Beef Carpaccio: Delicious. I was trying to restrain myself from piling each piece of beef into a pile and shoving it all into my mouth at once. 

Gnocchi: Lobster, truffle, sweet corn, basil and roasted tomatoes -- it was heavenly. I was surprised by the amount of lobster on the plate. Flavor explosion. The pasta was so delicate. I was never a fan of gnocchi. Now I'm a convert. 

Roasted Brussels Sprouts: Dare I say it? *gasp* They were better than Michael Symon's fried version.  (OMG, food nerds are going to be coming outta the Yelp woodwork to attack my shizz!!!) 

Goat Cheese Creme Brulee:  I usually order creme brulee anytime it's on a menu. I sorta have a thing for it. This one was one of my favorites. Any dessert that can do well with goat cheese as an ingredient gets a thumbs up from this girl. 

Overall, exceptional evening, in my opinion. Thank you Lago! 

(and thank you to Rachel B. for setting this up. and also Paulius N. for the vino!)"}
{"text":"Food is good, but way over priced for what it is and the portion sizes. Service was incredibly slow and their house Cabernet is $19 a glass! Hostesses gave away our table because we were about 10-15 mins late and claimed there was no where else to seat us for 2 hours until we told them we were going to go some where else. Then a table magically appeared and was ready for us. Weird. Bruschetta was good but thats pretty hard to mess up. Cannelloni was almost $20 for two thin pieces and it wasn't even all that good...the filling looked like cat food. Sorry nothing is worth that price for such a small size. Pappardelle al sugo bugiardo was tasty, but again over priced and small. If you want better tasting and more plentiful tapas style eating, go to Beauty and Essex. Their prices are similar but they at least give you a bit more food. I left feeling hungry and underwhelmed. Nice atmosphere and views of the fountain, but I would definitely not recommend or return."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had a brunch at Lago this morning. First, this restaurant offers a magnificent view of the Bellagio fountains, which in itself is enough to make a dining experience elevated to a higher level. Then, our amazing server brought 8 different scrumptious dishes to our table. He brought them over one by one, tasting each one with anticipation to the next. Just when we said 'oh this is the best one' then the next one came and we said it again. It was indeed a party in our palates. Our faves: Polenta with duck, quinoa salad, eggplant Parmesan benedict and raviolone. Our server, Derek, provided such excellent service. Thank you so much to Albert Najem, for providing the best brunch in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in late night after flying into Cleveland. The mussels were delicious as well as a great ambiance. The staff was really cool and the bartender made me some great drinks. It's also open late which is great glad I was able to get some good food after a long day traveling."}
{"text":"I'm on a roll with nice restaurants. Lago did not disappoint. We had a large party and ordered a variety of dishes to share.

Pesce.  This was raw fish, like sashimi or ceviche. We had the ahi tuna with the orange segments.  Very fresh and subtle. Delicious. The salmon with the caper was also interesting. Also fresh, but more savory.

Crabmeat Salad.  Crab with quinoa and baby greens. Tastes as fancy as it sounds. Again, it was fresh and luxurious.

Gnocchi.  We had both kinds, the plain with blue cheese and the potato ones with lobster. Both were delicious, especially the latter. It was such a good pairing.
 
Crostini. Very simple dish, with tomatoes and basil. Kind of expensive for what it is.

Deli Meats. There was prosciutto, salami, and bresaola. Good but nothing special. Maybe I'm not enough of a connoisseur to be able to distinguish between this and what I can get at Trader Joe's.

Lamb Ragu Pasta. I don't generally like lamb, but this was quite good. It was rich but I didn't taste any gaminess. 

Beef tenderloin. This was amazing. Cooked just right. It was tender and flavorful.

The food was amazingly good and amazingly expensive. It's not like I can afford to eat here all the time, but once or maybe twice is nice!"}
{"text":"So we are sitting at the bar which is half full and it takes 15 minutes to get a drink; a waitress stood in front of us and tried to pass us off to another. Break and we now have a drink but we still haven't been able to pay after another 20 because the bartender told us to find her and that she doesn't have time for us. 

GREAT service."}
{"text":"Lago is amazing!   Great view of the Bellagio fountains and the food is magnificent.   Here are a few must try dishes:

Caprese 
Antipasto Misto (the cheese and prosciutto are best) 
Beef Carpaccio
Osso Buco
Tonno (ahi tuna and orange slices / favorite dish of the night) 

Dessert 
I forgot the name of the dish but it is like a lemon meringue pie.   This dish had all the textures.   The crust on the bottom was life changing.   This dessert is so good it is worth going to this restaurant just to have it at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"I always order the lobster gnocchi and I'm never disappointed. It is absolutely perfect with just the right amount of richness. The meatballs are also something special."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and ordered the margherita pizza and minestrone soup. The pizza was a good size but the taste was nothing exciting. The minestrone soup was average as well. I felt both needed more seasoning."}
{"text":"Terrific meal - lot of delicious Italian small plates and a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. They only lost a star for the extra wait despite the reservations. Food is excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Service was okay- hostesses were very nice, but server was a little rude and short. My husband and I just stopped of for a small lunch with drinks. Wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"We ate here on Easter Sunday for dinner and had a wonderful experience. Our reservations were for 845. I really wanted to sit outdoors so that we could be located close to the bellaggio fountains show. Initially they told me it would not be possible but I could wait 15 minutes for a table with an inside view. After the short wait they were actually able to place us directly on the patio at a front and center table with amazing views of the fountain show. These seats were incredible and I highly recommend asking for outdoor seating in advance or possibly showing up early to see if they have any outdoor seating that you could wait for it. Our waiter Fabio was top notch. Great personality but really knows his stuff. He made the fine dining experience personable while still being formal, something that often lacks at higher end establishments. We ordered the bruschetta and also the Burrata. Both were great/ We then ordered the 7&7 gnocchi plate which was delicious and the mascarpone and shrimp stuffed pasta which I thought were just OK but which my husband enjoyed. The icing on the cake was the amazing Desert we got after just casually mentioning it was our anniversary. Fabio picked up on that and brought out one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had in my life, pictured below. Great food experience as well but feel like the service and environment is what made this place five stars instead of four."}
{"text":"Delicious tapas!  We went there three times over several days.  Twice we did their tasting menu and had them pick out various items.  All of them were delicious.  I wanted to try everything.  A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Amazingly poor service and terrible Caesar salad. Filettino was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Bad ass place !!!! Hip and fun , get the steak and pair it with a bottle of  opus one . Definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during restaurant week. It's in a great location in the flats! The decor is very modern and makes for a special night out. The main reason why this place gets 3 stars and not more is that the prices are a little high for what you get. Otherwise it was overall a good dining experience. 

We were seated promptly when we arrived. However, throughout our meal, our waiter out is off a little bit- we asked for more bread for the table, and we had to ask him again because it was taking so long. Also, when we got dessert, we asked for a couple of extra spoons to share, and even after we said we wanted spoons for everyone at the table, he only brought one extra spoon.. It was only after he saw someone scooping out of the communal dessert with a piece of fruit that he brought over more spoons. It seemed like he was bringing is the bare minimum, which was kind of a turn off considering how much the food costs.

As for the food, I ordered off the restaurant week menu and got the calamari as an appetizer, the lobster gnocchi for my entree, and the panna cotta for dessert. The calamari was tasty, and it was refreshing since it isn't fried like most calamari is, but the portion is tiny!! I would definitely not order it for the regular price. The entree, on the other hand, was great. The gnocchi were nice and light, and the sauce was tasty. Only complaint really is that I don't think there was actually that much lobster in it- the pieces that are there are a good size, but it seemed like there were more tomatoes in the dish to make it seem like there were more lobster pieces. Someone else in our group ordered the baked cavatelli, which he said was good, but it was soaked in a cream sauce which is kind of a cop out at a lot of Italian restaurants, which I kind of agreed with in my dish as well. Finally, as for the dessert, the panna cotta was delicious! I would definitely order that again if I go here again- it was nice and creamy with the right hint of sweetness. 

Overall, the atmosphere was very nice, and makes for a nice evening out. However, if I had to pay for my meal myself, I probably wouldn't choose to come here, as you can get better quality Italian food for a better price and value elsewhere."}
{"text":"Beautiful Italian restaurant in Bellagio Las Vegas. Visited this beautiful restaurant for the first time, we were seated on the patio and watched the beautiful fountains. The pastas were very good, also the grilled langoustines we delicious. The desserts were absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"They do a great job with service and the restaurant looks amazing.  The food is interesting.. the portions are very small.  The short rib pasta roll up thing was weird because the short rib meat was blended or something so it was unrecognizable.  It had a weird pungent taste to it which was odd, maybe it's from the sauce?  The spicy sausage crostini thing was definitely pungent tasting which was hard to like.  Octopus was very good, but the couscous added nothing.  The raw beef dish was pretty tasty.  Spring chicken was nice.  Fish was just ok.  I'd stop in for maybe a bottle of wine and some snacks but not sure I'd try to eat a meal there again."}
{"text":"Just expected better. While the service was lovely, the food was not as creative or tasty. The asparagus and potatoes were bland. I appreciated the fresh, well cooked quality but I was left wanting. The ricotta and honey focaccia was creative but semi burnt and just edible. Pizza also not impressive. Thin, crispy crust- over simplified crust and so basic for the gourmet experience I expected. I did like the short ribbed cannelloni. Those were creative and flavorful. It had a lovely view of the fountains and again, great, thoughtful service. Glad we went but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Everything I got was on point and service was great! I also had a table near the bellagio fountain view so it was nice to see that going on! The only complaint is that the tables are too close together and it's so loud I feel like I had to yell to order my food and while dining with my boyfriend as well. But everything else was great!! They just should remove some tables and it would be great!!"}
{"text":"Location inside the Bellagio through the main doors to the right.

  Would not recommend going to this place there that a bit snooty if you want to have cocktails you have to sit at one location if you want to eat a meal or snack you have to sit somewhere else if you want to phone where she got to sit in a different place and have all these rules in there it'll let you sit anywhere you want that's why the place is sitting empty I would deathly go somewhere else on the entire strip is way better places in this location, I would not even waste your time"}
{"text":"PROS
- nice place to go with a large group. The food is served as small plates, great for sharing
- good options for many palates (my co-worker is a vegetarian and she found lots of things that worked for her)
- location is lovely especially at night to watch the Bellagio fountains
- OUTSTANDING items: (1) polenta; (2) pasta with a bolognase (it had lamb in the sauce and the pasta was tubular - like a rigatoni); (3) seafood risotto;, (4) their house limocello; (5) bread with soft cheese and honey 

CONS
- We had a reservation for 8 and arrived at 8:10 (our bad). They said they would have a table in 20 minutes but we actually didn't get seated until about 9. But on the plus side, they did bring some complimentary cheese and meat, which was a nice touch.
- I thought the service was just okay - would have expected more from an upscale restaurant in this city. I had to ask for extra spoons and plates a couple of times
- Besides the above mentioned items, the food was pretty good, not great. On the \"meh\" list: hamachi crudo, spaghetti with seafood (frutti de mare), asparagus

I'd definitely go again, especially with a group."}
{"text":"Chef Julian Serrano aims to please and never disappoints! Lago is a new sleek, hip and contemporary restaurant that offers amazing views of the Bellagio fountains! Lagos menu showcases a modern take on Italian tapas. There is so much variety on the menu for any palate.  Service is impeccable also.  I will definitely dine here again!!"}
{"text":"We go to Vegas minimum 5-7 times a year and we have dined all over Vegas.  This was one of the worst places we have ever dined.  The food is a joke.  I ordered the Papardelle with zucchini Ragu. Oh my god, there were literally 5 pieces of pasta in my plate. My husband ordered the Fussili with lamb ragu.  While the taste was not too bad, the size is ridiculous for the price.  Imagine a very small bowl (the small bowl is the center of a big plate - looking big but very small in reality) that was the plate. There were literally 10 pieces of fussili in the plate with some ragu on it.  My mom ordered something with mushroom which turned out to be a side (and the menu does not say side) and my dad ordered fussili as well.  

Tables are a few inch apart and you can hear your neighbors conversations.  The waiters bumped into my seat like a million times (sooooooooo annoying).  The view is absolutely beautiful.  Staff was OK.  We had a reservation and we were seated right away.  

I understand the concept of smaller plates and quality food BUT here they have really small plates with not much quality.  We have tried from the cheapest restaurants to the most expensive ones where you spend serious $$$$$ but this one is on the low end and we will not go back again.  

We are a regular at the Bellagio (both staying and dining) but we will not go back again. Don't waste your money, go to Fix or other restaurants in Bellagio."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good.  Try to come early to get a seat by the window, where you can watch the Bellagio watershow as you eat.  You also have a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower across the street.  This is a tapas style place with a wide selection of delicious small plates, and plan to eat slowly in the company of friends.  The octopus was delicious, branzino excellent- actually all of the plates were very tasty.  Very nice interior decor.  Service was excellent.  Prepare to spend a pretty penny!"}
{"text":"Best Gluten free vegan pizza in the world!!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience but terrible service. Long wait to even get a menu, long wait just for appetizers. The tuna was bland and did not even taste like tuna. Server never came back to check on us or bring the check, even after giving him a card he never came back. Had to ask two other employees, finally someone else brought back the card but without the ticket to sign, so had to give them the card again to be run. After all that no apologies or discount on the bill. Would not go back!"}
{"text":"I love lago! I have been here twice now. 
We waited a short amount of time for our reservation. Our table had a great view of the fountain which is a plus. My passion fruit mojito was delicious. This place is small plate restaurant which makes it very easy to share many plates. We ordered the ceasar 
salad,bruschetta,pasta,polenta,and 
meatballs. The only dish I wouldn't order again is the ceasar salad. 
The meatballs and polenta are always my favorite.  

I would come here before a night out but not for a romantic dinner the music is blaring which makes it difficult to converse. The music selection is Edm and house music which I enjoy but not so much for dinner. Our service was attentive at first but slowed down as we got to the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Friday after finding Lolita (intended place to go for the night) had a wait for an hour and 45 minutes. I should have made reservations but I didn't think it would be that long for just two people. Anyways, I was open to try other places. 

So we crossed the street and checked out this place instead. What a great replacement! I ordered the mussels and clams, side of squash, and a martini. The mussels and clams were cooked right and tasted great. The squash was grilled and seasoned right. It was very flavorful. The martini tasted strong but isn't that what a martini should be!? I'm not complaining at all. I forgot what the name of the drink is called but it had grapefruit in it so it was pink. The waitress said it's their most popular drink. My friend ordered their pizza. 

It was flatbread pizza with chicken and it was good too. The presentation was elegant and it is one of those places you take a person on a date for. A candlelight dinner but they do have a bar area with TVs so it can be a chill place to go too. The decor is very elegant and the bar area is wooded so you have that nice crisp look."}
{"text":"Went for Valentines Day. Best experience in Vegas! The food was amazing! The view was spectacular! Will be visiting again for sure!"}
{"text":"Just ok.

Very cool, sexy place.

Good service, very attentive.

$50 corkage fee, only if they don't have the wine you've brought on their menu.

The portions are tiny. I mean tiny. The food tastes fine, but you would expect much more for these prices. You are primarily paying for the ambiance, which is definitely great...but if you're looking for some spectacular dining with food that will leave you wanting to come back for more, this is not the place."}
{"text":"We made a reservation through yelp, and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Per the many reviewers before us, at check in I asked for a seat by the windows. The lovely hostess told us there would be a wait of 20 to 30 minutes to accommodate that request, and being that we had no other plans, the wait at the bar was just fine. 

In reality, it was 10 minutes. 

We sat at the bar and the bartender made beautiful, tasty drinks. We were ushered to our seats that were basically located inside of the Bellagio fountains -- we were that close to the water show. 

Every dish we ordered was perfection. Every time the fountains blasted on, we did little happy dances in our seats. When the final bill came, we were amazed that our decadent dinner was reasonably prices. Lago, you really delivered!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and the food has been consistently very good. The menu is interesting without being weird. Our server, Ariel was excellent. He paced everything perfectly and checked on us just the right amount. He gave suggestions about the menu without being pushy. The antipasti combination sampler was so good we could have just had that for dinner. It was generous and varied. My pasta dinner had great flavor.  The only downside was that I was too full for dessert- they sounded good. Although it was too cold, the patio looked nice. We will be back to try it out!"}
{"text":"I give Lago four stars a little reluctantly.  Atmosphere is cool, but staff while informed about their food, don't seem to care about any party smaller than a six top. Our waiter seemed to do the math in his head when we ordered seven items for two people and decided to spend his time with more profitable tables.  Also, while the food was solid, it's hard to have a coherent meal with the selections - so you end up feeling like you ate at a high end buffet.  Do cured meats really go with the garlic covered octopus and seafood salad?  Should it be followed by lamb?   All delicious, but very rich and odd together."}
{"text":"I was dying to check-out Lago after having such an amazing experience at his other restaurant in the Aria.  I met a coworker for lunch on Wednesday and we shared the salmon salad with candied walnuts, the proscuitto and fig pizza and the spanish ham and burrata with diced tomatoes - everything was fresh, flavorful and so ridiculously delicious!  We were seated at the window overlooking the fountains and Paris...perfection!  Great food, atmosphere, views and service = a winning combination!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed! Made reservation 2 months in advance for an outdoor seat for a special date night. Waited 15 minutes on phone to confirm reservation, then waited 40 minutes to be seated, only to be sat at a high table inside the restaurant next to the bar. Ordered a cheese platter which is extremely small but decided to leave due to disappointing service and seating."}
{"text":"Ok maybe a 2.5 I had the salmon salad for lunch and it was quite possibly one of the worst pieces of salmon I've ever had. The waiter was a little awkward I think it could be his first serving job. I've done my share of time on that side of the industry. I would have expected a more seasoned server at that caliber of a restaurant. Our app was delivered to the wrong table. He must have messed up the seat numbers too because all the food was handed to the wrong person. I don't like it when my food is raffled off when you are paying $$$ (if it's $ then I don't care). I've been there before and the meatballs are really good. I asked for a double espresso and when the runner brought out a single he asked if I wanted him to bring it back and fix it!Are you kidding me YES I want my caffeine please. I didn't send back my meal because I never do. So... to be fair I never gave them a chance to redeem themselves. My friend also got the salmon and said hers was fine."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant in Vegas great food , great service. I highly recommend it for lunch time patio and bellagio fountain show ."}
{"text":"It is very nice can only see the fountains from some seats food was good but super small when they say share it they mean one bit or two. Very good ravioli omg was my fav I wish I had 4 orders to my self. Also super noisy not the place if you are looking to have good conversation."}
{"text":"The best restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas so far hands down if you get table outside the view of the waterfalls show is spectacular we were treated so well and Fabio was very attentive !the food came in small but fulfilling portions !! We had the best outside seating !!!recommend it for the food the wine me the service !"}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant!!! The food and service were amazing! We came here our first night on a girls trip and were very accommodating of a large group - 7 people. We got various small platters and shared. We asked the server his favorites and got everything from pastas to fish to salads. They also recommended a bottle of wine which we shared. 

The bill came out to around $250 (with alcohol!) which is great for 7 people! 

You can see the Bellagio fountain show from this restaurant which is absolutely gorgeous. It makes for a romantic ambience. It's a nice restaurant and people tended to dress classy. 

We will definitely be coming back for future Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Just spent NYE at Lago.  Such a huge disappointment!  I'll start with the one positive, after requesting a window table, the view was spectacular.  Unfortunately, that's all that is good about this place.  The food was not good and cold.  It was a NYE special in Vegas and a champagne toast was not included.  It was 30 degrees and they sat people outside and opened the door all night, we were freezing.  Don't go!  Not even close to worth the price.  I also got sick when I got home.  Overall awful!"}
{"text":"An interesting evening to say the least!  My reservation was for 6:15 and I was seated quickly at a small, inappropriate placed, highly dysfunctional table.  The saving grace was that I could watch the fountains at the Bellagio during my meal.  My waiter was attentive and I was served my salad fairly quickly, however, it went downhill from there.  As my main entree I ordered the Risotto with rhubarb and cooked prosciutto.  It was an interesting choice, one that didn't turn me off as I kept eating, but one that left me not knowing what I thought of it.  During my meal, it was over an hour before anyone stopped and asked me how I was doing.  I flagged my waiter to ask for the dessert menu, another 15 minutes before asking what I'd like, another 15 before it came, which wasn't worth the wait.  I could have gone home and made it myself, and it would have been a lot better.  The Tiramisu was DIGUSTING!!!  When you're with a group, I understand you can spend a couple of hours enjoying a meal but dining with just one other person, it shouldn't take 2 hours and 15 minutes for one person. I read some of the other reviews and I most certainly don't agree with them.  This is one restaurant I won't be revisiting!"}
{"text":"Took my mother for her birthday. Absolutely amazed with the entire experience from service, quality of food and view of the fountains. Only issue I had was that there seemed to be a piece of plastic after chewing on some food. Didn't really want to say anything as we just wanted to enjoy the experience so I ignored it but everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Oh my God is all I have to say. 

Our reservation was for 7:30, we got sat around 8 which I'm fine with since we were about 7 minutes late and I work in a restaurant so I understand how it is. It was our two year anniversary and I've never been to a fancy nice restaurant. 

Our server, John, was amazing. Huge props to him for handing many tables at once. He still stopped by after we got every dish within two minutes which is a huge thing for my boyfriend and I (2 bites 2 minutes rule encase anything was messed up), got us drinks when he noticed they were half way done, and he basically suggested every plate that we had! He's very good at what he does. I'll definitely ask for him when we come back. 
Our food came out way quicker than I expected. Nothing took more than 15 minutes which was amazing! The first things we had were the brasato d'anatra and the ravioli al gamberi. The brasato.. I was literally slapped in the face with how phenomenal it was. Honestly no words can describe the flavors I had in my mouth. So many different flavors and it was so delicious. Pretty creamy too and it was just so delightful to eat we almost ordered it again. The ravioli was the worst thing we had there yet it was still amazing. Then we ordered the fusillioro. This was my second favorite plate that we had. I would trust these cooks with my life if it was based off this cooking. The risotto di fruti mare was amazing too. The clams were seasoned amazingly, scallops cooked to perfection, lobster was very tender, not a bad thing about this dish. John recommended an amazing dessert that he paid for since it was a celebration. It was the giandujotto. It's not too heavy like most desserts. You can easily compare it to a ferrero rocher. 

Our tab was $99.99. Good pricing for such an amazing meal and the location!
 We saw about 4 water shows in total. Extremely gorgeous. 

I'm a very happy person right now. Thank you Lago for making our anniversary dinner amazing. We WILL be back. (:"}
{"text":"Finally came here after a year of living near the Flats! It's very nice inside and the staff is very nice. I had a hard time choosing my meal, but settled on the gluten free Cavatappi pasta and our table split a side of the garlic kale. The pasta was amazing and probably some of the gluten free I've ever had. The kale was very good but I would probably order the potatoes next time. My friends ordered the chopped salad (had a bite - amazing), lobster gnocchi, and prima vera pasta. Everything was delicious and I'll surely be back!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for dinner.  The bartenders were terrific, friendly and hardworking (Tracy especially). Unfortunately the food was disappointing for the price-point.  I had the scallops appetizer... tasty with a nice presentation but were not properly cleaned as they were gritty.  Also had the Ahi tuna, also a nice presentation but the tuna was tough and not of high quality.  For my entree I had the clams in spicy white wine sauce... it was excellent. Good food starts with quality ingredients and proper preparation and unfortunately they missed it that evening."}
{"text":"If I could give this  restaurant more than 5 stars, I would in a heart beat! Lago certainly did not disappoint! We requested to sit outside with a fountain view, and they did. We say right by the Bellagio fountains and man oh man was the view breath taking! We had such an amazing waiter who explained the tapas style menu and was so helpful! We ordered everything from half the menu and a few cocktails. My boyfriend and I had no words when trying the food. It was the most delicious food! The bet part of the night was seeing Julain Serrano himself! He was going around checking on everyone. I asked him for a picture and he was so nice! My last name is also Serrano so we definitely connected (as my family is from Spain) I can't wait to go back to Lago in the summer time and sit in the exact spot we sat in and experience this beautiful breath taking view again, oh and eat and drink of course! Well done Julain Serrano!!"}
{"text":"I  have to start by saying that I am a huge fan of Chef Julian Serrano and was very excited to eat at Lago as I had not previously dined there.  The hostess was very sweet and prompt.  It was a Sunday night and the only thing available were high tops near the bar despite the restaurant looking not that busy.  We sat at high tops and ordered two drinks.  I got the Rose and Rye I believe it was called which was delicious.  The sweet with underlying Rye spice was very well balanced.  The presentation was also nice.  My date got a Jameson and ginger that didn't taste that good at first.  It appeared and tasted as if the soda was flat which is no big deal.  It took the server a bit to check back with us but we did get our drink replaced.  I think the high top seats are served by lounge or cocktail servers opposed to waiter and waitresses.  I can honestly say I wasn't impressed with our server.  She didn't seem very attentive, but hey everyone has off days.  The food was amazing!  The variety of selections are nice as well as the ability to share.  The clams were good and not too spicy and the steak was cooked perfectly.  I would go back here time and time again for the ambiance and food alone as well as visit one of Chef's other restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dining experience at Lago! Being brand new, it has a modern feel but without feeling too cold and offering a somewhat cozy environment, as well. The bar area is fabulous with an open flame fire pit and nice patio for the Summer time.

The dining area is also very nice and comfortable. It gives off a classy vibe without feeling too uptight. Love the menu-- so many options and prices vary for any range. I had the stuffed tortellini and didn't leave anything on my plate it was that good! 

I will for sure be going back to Lago :)"}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars for Lago!  Some of the best Italian food I've experienced in the city of Cleveland.  A big group of us were here for an UYE family dinner arranged by Rachel B. (Thanks again!) and I had a really great time.

We arrived a little before 7 and the place was already hopping, the dining room was close to full and the bar was completely packed, so we were ushered into the Carriage Room in the back...we get our own private room?  We can be as loud as we want without the fear of disturbing other patrons of this lovely restaurant?  Score!  This was a really good move by the restaurant since we tend to be a more.....errrr, \"outgoing\" group, shall we say  ;o)

Our own private server was assigned to take care of our group and he did a wonderful job (good luck in medical school this fall!), especially dealing with the difficulty of the staggered entrance of our group.  Drinks started flowing minutes after we sat down and appetizers were flying out of the kitchen very soon thereafter.

I was able to try out a few different things by virtue of sitting next to a couple of gentlemen who enjoy sharing their food!

Mussels and clams to start were ok, a little on the smaller side and the broth wasn't anything outstanding.

The Poached Pear Salad was very good, something that I would definitely like to try and recreate at home.  Simple ingredients, but they played off of each other very nicely.  A light and refreshing interlude to my main course.

Gnocchi - oh yeah, what Stefanie C. said.....absolutely phenomenal.  And no, this isn't your typical store-bought gnocchi, guaranteed they were making this from scratch in the kitchen because each piece was a little bit of a different size and there were no machinery marks indicative of mass production on them at all.  Some of the best gnocchi I have ever had and I will come back for more.  The lobster and sweet corn with truffle, basil and roasted tomatoes worked perfectly for the dish, everything came together in sweet harmony.

The Grilled Lamb Chops were also something to write home about, especially that Pumpkin Gratin, WHERE did that come from??  Probably one of my favorite components of that plate!  And yes, finally a place that knows how to serve lamb chops....we were at Johnny's downtown for Restaurant week and that little rack of lamb served there paled in comparison to this beautiful composition.

Even though I loved my dishes, I was slightly jealous of Rachel B.'s veal tortelloni....I must try  ;o)

Goat Cheese Crème Brûlée.....I wasn't going to order this originally, I had my heart set on the Pear tartlette, but boy am I glad my dining partner put up a fuss!  ;o)  Absolutely incredible, so light and airy, it literally was a little piece of heaven in my mouth.....I really didn't want to share it at all, but I conceded a little bite of it in exchange for a bite of Tiramisu.  The Tiramisu was good, but not good enough to tear my greedy palate away from my goat cheese dessert!

Coffee, tea and wine (complements of Paulius N., thank you again!) capped off the end of another wonderful Yelp get together with some of my favorite people in this city.  Thank you Lago for going that extra mile and making it a very memorable night!"}
{"text":"So disappointing and upsetting experience. First off when I booked a week prior they asked if we were celebrating anything, I told them yes, my Mothers birthday to which they made a note. Not quite sure why as they didn't do anything at all.
They were 20 minutes late, we arrived on time and once our table was ready no apology for such a delay.
Now to the part that made me want to cry. I have a broken foot and it is hard for me to get around in my boot. I was walking to my table from the restroom and taking my time when someone came up behind me, knocked me and tried to push passed me. I turned around and to my surprise it was the assistant manager, Anish. Once he saw my boot he apologized but the damage was already done. It's embarrassing enough having people stare at you but this was just upsetting.
He came over and apologize again and said, had he known I was in a boot he never would've pushed passed. To which I asked, so you would do that to any paying customer?
I will say he took of a few things off our bill but it doesn't make a mark on how upset and embarrassed he made me feel."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL VIEW WONDERFUL DRINKS AMAZING FOOD 

my friend had found this place in yelp awhile ago and we had been meaning to check it out :) 

We decided to go for lunch we luckily got a table outside so we could sit and enjoy the view the weather was beautiful that day :) 

We ordered some drinks to start I forgot the name of mine but there was a cool flower in the ball of ice :) 

We ordered the salmon and scallops to start , the scallops were ok but I actually enjoyed the salmon more 

We also ordered the carpaccio it's my fav and it was delicious 

*we ordered the lobster but we were both disappointed it was so small it was literally like one bite each not worth the price* 

The wagu was amazing I super recommend this 

I'm not sure the name of the other items we ordered one was like a soup and the other was a pasta 

I will come back for another round :)"}
{"text":"Who is giving 4 stars for this place? Clearly, you have no understanding of the concept of Italian food. Here are the pluses:

1. Great location.
2. Friendly staff. The young waiter with glasses (Monday) was superb. What a great guy!

Here are the minuses:

1. Lame inappropriate music.
2. Pork ravioli - it was pork... stuffed in pasta!
3. Vegetarian ravioli - it was peas...stuffed in pasta!!
4. The restrooms, including the staircase leading down to them were a disgrace - stinking!

This place needs a kick up the ass. Such potential!"}
{"text":"Over priced and uninspired. Read the rest for specifics.

We found the food here to be uninspired. My wife and I ordered 6 different dishes (it's mostly small plate).  We started with the bruschetta and Caprese. The tomatoes in the bruschetta were overripe and tasteless. There wasn't enough basil, olive oil or balsamic. I also prefer having some fresh garlic and there wasn't any. I realize garlic isn't a thing in real Italian, just a personal preference. The caprese didn't have enough basil, EVOO or aged balsamic and the tomatoes were again bland. 

I had a main course (large plate) of lobster and squid ink pasta. The lobster was OK but for $65 I would have expected better taste. My wife got two small plates (pesto and veggie pasta with Arabbiatta sauce). The pesto was OK, but the Arabbiatta was boring and filled with the cheapest veggies available (sqaush and carrots). We also got asparagus. We thought we were going cheap and dinner was still over 200 after a modest tip. I do not recommend. More show than go."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review yet for this place!?!?  It was absolutely phenomenal. Pricey- but as expected.  Made reservations here before the Britney show and I'm drooling just thinking about it again.  A very pricey place with the view to match the price tag.  The service was very over the top - in a good way and the food was delectable.  There are SO many places to go in Vegas for good food but the experience here will be worth coming back when we're in town again.  I loved it.  All of it.  Just being there made me feel all \"woo hoo\""}
{"text":"Great pick for a classy dinner while in Vegas. 

Not just because the food is delicious (more on that later) but also because of the location. Lago overlooks the fountains at the Bellagio and at night when the fountains light up the view is absolutely beautiful. We weren't lucky enough to snag outdoor seating but you can still catch this from inside because of how many big windows there are.

Food is small plates Italian and everything comes out FAST. So if you want to order course by course to see how much food you'll need you can definitely do that. We were pretty hungry and ordered 5 plates amongst the two of us. I'd say you need at least 4 plates for dinner because they are pretty small.

To start we had the burrata which was actually my least favorite part of the meal. The plate came with a generous portion of cheese but for some reason it didn't look or taste like burrata. It felt more like a ricotta cheese dip. Not bad, but not what we were expecting. And a little frustrating because burrata comes with a heftier price tag.

Luckily the rest of the meal made up for it. Gnocchi with lobster chunks is a must get. This comes in a delicious pink sauce and the lobster is oh so decadent. Crab, artichoke and parmesan are three of my favorite things independently, so on a plate together this was unreal good. This dish felt fresh and healthy, almost like a salad. I loved how it was topped with multicolored cherry tomatoes. And there was a very generous portion of crab in the dish. Veal and ricotta stuffed pasta - the mans favorite. Very small portion - three little dumplings but so rich that it did not need to be larger. And finally to round out the meal we put in an order of meatballs which were classic and tasty. Sounds like alot of food, but both pasta dishes were only a few small bites. 

For drinks we went with cocktails -- I had some sort of fruity vodka drink and it was light and refreshing. They also brought out a piece of cake that said happy birthday and a candle for my fiance's birthday upon request. Super sweet and he really enjoyed it! The cake was chocolate espresso... 'nuff said.

A pricey meal, but what else could you expect at The Bellagio - especially when cocktails and lobster are thrown into the mix. For a similar meal expect to spend around 100 PP. But, for delicious food in a swanky setting this is worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The value is just not there. The decor and location are great, and the service was good too. My husband and I went there before going to the O show. We do not mind paying the price if the food is worth it. Lago is supposedly an Italian restaurant. We love good Italian restaurants. Judging by the menu, this one seemed promising. However, Lago's cuisine was just not up to par. I selected the mushroom risotto. The rice was undercooked and the whole thing tasted as if it had come from a dry food package.  No depth to it whatsoever. The same with my husband's small portion of pasta ai frutti di mare, which cost $29. I would not recommend this restaurant, and I certainly would never go there again."}
{"text":"I really think this food was awful everything seemed like it was made in the microwave. The fish smelled like it was bad. The service was absolutely the best but sucks how the good was awful. Please go somewhere else."}
{"text":"VERY small portions, over priced and at the end of the meal you will be left with the overall feeling of..... meh....."}
{"text":"Tapas, Tapas and more Tapas. 
I am starting to feel as if everything on the strip is turning into a Tapas only location. But Lago's Tapas are A+++ Stand out. I had the opportunity to try one of the best Veggie Lasagnas I ever had in my life, this thing was cooked to perfection, every flavor just stood right out, I also ordered a margarita pizza, delicious and a must have, please don't ignore the simplicity of the Tomato, it was very flavorful. Now the location brings this restaurant over the top, directly in front of the water show it was beautiful as you walk in look to your right, that wall of wine and champs make for the perfect photo op.  Do not leave this place without getting Dessert! I tried everyone, and I recommend the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - we were running late for J Lo's show and they got our food out fast.  My BF had steak with asparagus and I had the lobster knuckles with gnocchi.  We also had tiramisu for dessert and some caramel mocha tasting cake.  This place has an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains - very classy inside and we enjoyed our meal here."}
{"text":"Take your pick: 
(Sunday evening, party of 7)
-The absentee, surly waiter
-The water dripping from the A/C ducts into our heads
-The overly greasy pizza
-The ravioli literally sitting in oil
-The half-hearted oil & vinegar dipping mixture on the table
-The high prices
-The Slow service, despite being one of only five parties dining
-The loud music that desperately screamed 'we're a cool restaurant...we promise!'"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made reservations here during our trip to Las Vegas. We chose it because of the Italian small plates and the Bellagio fountain views it advertised. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful when asked for recommendations. We loved the concept of the tapas style, especially for Italian food. The burrata was one of the best I've ever had and their cocktails were beautiful and well presented. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the \"dress code.\" When choosing a restaurant at the Bellagio, Lago stated it had a 'business casual' dress code. My boyfriend and I thought this would be a perfect choice for a fancier night out. However, while sitting at the bar waiting for our drinks, a group of people sat next to us in flip flops and tank tops. If there's a dress code, it should be enforced in order to maintain a specific clientele. 

I would definitely recommend Lago and will be returning if/when I return to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Closed for lunch but they do have a small tasting menu that you can try at the bar and high tables.  The drinks were amazing! We tried a Mojito and a rye and cherry cocktail.  Both had flowers in them.  The caprese salad was my favorite.  The salmon was very good and fresh.  The ribeye was our least favorite.  It was cut in flat squares and the sauce was too heavy for us.  The restaurant is beautiful."}
{"text":"brunch is amazing! the bacon is delicious, very nice area and decor. I had the sausage gravy biscuits and poached egg. service was wonderful, i will be back"}
{"text":"Even with a reservation we had a wait, but it was worth it! The Caesar salad was divine, the cheese tray appetizer very tasty. We also had several pasta dishes, a couple of meat choices and desserts. All were amazing. 

Also have to mention the view. The wall of windows overlooking the fountains and the Strip were really a wonderful addition to the experience.

The service was also top notch. This was the best meal I've had in Vegas (and that's saying something). Go for it and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings. Nice atmosphere. Service friendly but slow. Poached salmon salad 11$ about 3oz of salmon no taste. But 16$ burger was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert- loved the music and the outdoor dj! He was playing the best music. Try the pistachio mousse- it was unusual and tasty. Decor is also very nice. Woukd like to try dinner here next time. They stay open really late which is great. Try this place for sure:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Vegas for my birthday in July and we got reservations for my birthday dinner here. We requested a table by the window and we're seated in a perfect spot to view the fountain. There weren't as many things on the menu that really intrigues me as I had hoped, but what I got for my main & dessert was really tasty. We did get the bruschetta for an appetizer and it was not all that great. It needed some balsamic and mozzarella and not just tomato. For the main, I got the fillet with potatoes and asparagus and my husband got the same. It was cooked a perfect medium, which is what I prefer. We got the delicious chocolate cake dessert. It was a tasty 35th birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I were here for a concert and decide to try Lago which we have been wanting to to try for some time. 

Located in the Bellagio resort on the water facing the fountains. We had a lovely view of the fountains which we requested. Even 3 days before we arrived we were able to get this spot because we were willing to go early. We made a reservation at 5:15 PM. 

Amazing views from the balcony and the weather was so mild. The view was spectacular from our table. The food was equal or the view. 

The style here is what the waiter called: Italian tapas. Small plates.

We started with:
The Cesare which was made with baby romaine, anchovy dressing and
ciabatta croutons. Delicious.

Next we had Bruschetta al Pomodoro which was tomatoes, basil, garlic oil. Delicious. Could taste every ingredient. 

Next was Patate al Forno, roasted potatoes, rosemary. Good, not spatacular. Just roasted fingerling potatoes. Nothing special.

Next was Polenta al Formaggio which was 3 cheeses soft polenta. WOW, best polenta I have ever eaten. Soft, creamy, cheesy; Outstanding. We should have ordered 2 of these. Sooo oh good.

Next was Cannelloni comprised of pulled short ribs, parmesan fonduta, tomato sauce. Ok, but not that great. The short ribs was a sort of puree and felt strange in my mouth. Not that flavorful. I would pass.

Last was 7 & 7 which was potato gnocchi, lobster knuckles,
salsa di crostacei. Outstanding. Soft pillows of gnocchi with succulent lobster knuckles. So good.

We skipped desert as we were so full. I will be honest the desert did not look that great, but maybe it was because we were so full

Service was great 5/5 and Food was good 5/5. Overall 5/5. Amazing meal with amazing views!"}
{"text":"Service was good. The food was ok, nothing to really rave about. Totally overpriced for the food being mediocre. But the 1 thing that truly gave the drop in stars was the music. Non stop Euro house music. The only time it stopped was every time the Bellagio fountains were doing a show. During those short minutes, the ambience was nice."}
{"text":"I setup a work dinner party here. I requested the balcony but ended up getting a table with no view of lago. The staff was great m except the manager wasn't accommodating or apologetic for not trying to get us the balcony. We spent over $200/ person and apparently the balcony has a minimum of $150/ person but we had to sing a contract to get the balcony. No one told me that. The staff was great. Food was great. The waiter picked a bunch of plates for us to share with multiple courses. All in all, a convenient place to eat before we went to the O by cirque du soleil show at night."}
{"text":"In case you didn't know, which you probably did, this place is owned by the same group as Gusto and Grotto - need I say more?! Yes, add to that the lobster gnocchi for those who know good food ;-) Consistently fantastic food, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Don't really know what I respected with this place because the reviews weren't very good, but I guess I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Seated right at out reservation time, 
Service 9/10. The waitress and hostess were friendly, and they gave me a free birthday dessert. My water glass reached the bottom a few times though. 
Atmosphere 10/10. Got to sit at the seat overlooking the Bellagio's beautiful fountain show. Room was pretty and colorful.
Food was okay. 6.5/10 
My favorite was definitely the speck pizza with ricotta cheese... Amazing! 
The shrimp ravioli and lobster gnocchi weren't very good, neither was the beef carpaccio over the top. The charcuterie plate was decent, but not much to it. They are tapas portions, but very small and expensive. The dessert they gave me for free as a birthday thing was very bland and tasteless. Wouldn't eat it if I got it for free again. It wasn't an overall bad experience, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Could be considered subordinate to every other restaurant in Vegas. 
Recommend: speck pizza, charcuterie  
Skip: dessert, shrimp ravioli"}
{"text":"I really love Julian Serrano's reataurants. Last year we had a great time at Picasso, this year's trip to Vegas we tried Lago. This restaurant has a different vide, much more relaxed and casual. The food is Italian tapas, small plates designed for sharing. The views of the Bellagio fountain alone is worth coming but the winner here is the food. Great quality and taste. Please check out my photos. We ordered 4 small plates to share as appetizers, caprese salad, chicken liver pate, mushrooms and bruschetta. My main was the most excellent seafood pasta. I ask for a dinner size and they easily accommodated. We had 4 deserts to share to finish off. 

I have been to Vegas many times and this restaurant is now easily in my top 5. Just wonderful. From the views to the exciting, fun atmosphere to the terrifc food what else do you need.....oh a picture with the chef......got that too."}
{"text":"Great service (thanks Daniel) & great views of the Bellagio fountain.  Food choices are small plates, unusual and delicious.  Wine list is high end ($$$) but wine steward helped guide us to a great bottle at a fair price.  All in all a great place for a special occasion.  Thanks Lago!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view on the balcony of the water show that went off every 15 mins once the sun set.  The service was friendly and didn't rush us to take our time.  Their drinks - martinis were amazing- top notch mixology!  And they have an extensive selection of wines and beer.  The appetizers were a enough for 2/3 people to share and pure deliciousness.  The soups was a great and even in the hot weather we couldn't get enough of it.  The prime rib was made to our liking, juice and full of flavor and it was enough food to share and feel perfectly full after.  It was a special place, busy, but great friendly service.  The decor was stunning and it was very clean.  The kitchen was open to see the chefs hard at work.  And the best part was I was surprised with an engagement ring... It was planned and the waiter treated us with a free desert to celebrate our special moment.  He also brought the champaign right after my Mr. Popped the question.  Perfectly timing and the crowd around us watched with clapping, smiles, and heartfelt congratulations. It was an unforgettable experience.  When in Vegas you must try the Lago experience, you won't be let down!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life. My wife and I went there for their Thanksgiving dinner special ($33)and had no idea that the dish that they served was a 1oz piece of turkey some Italian sausage that tasted and looked like it came out of a can of spam & three pieces of ravioli with some sauce. We imagined it to be a Thanksgiving dinner with at least two juicy slices of turkey, cranberry sauce and some stove top stuffing. I deeply do regret going there for their so called shitty dinner, my wife and I were so displeased and to make it even worse it was our anniversary that we were also celebrating. I have buyers remorse and wish I had not gone there at all especially when $40 of my money was spent. (Yes it's $40 but it would have been better if I just burnt that money because it was a pure disgrace and waste of money that I went there). You guys should NOT have advertised a Thanksgiving dinner when the food that was served was barely enough to satisfy a two year old. I'm extremely displeased and will be sure to tell everyone I know to never go Lago for any of their (holiday specials). You guys suck! We ended up eating Thai food an hour after and was fully satisfied all while spending much less."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here for our anniversary dinner, and we loved it. Their concept of small plates is not something I have seen at upscale Italian places.

The truffle mushroom Risotto was so delicious, we saved some of it for the end, and ordered other things in the meantime. The Riesling was fantastic, and the Margarita and other small plates were delicious. 

We mentioned about anniversary once, in our Open Table booking, but they certainly took that into account and gave us a table by the gorgeous Bellagio fountain. Moreover, they added a special message on our dessert too.

One thing to note is that this is not a place for quiet conversations. It has a great, energetic ambiance though.

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I loved the gingery tequila cocktail, I got a green salad with no salmon, pasta and their bread is so good with oil & vinegar! Delicious wines too and the view is really the best view in vegas!!"}
{"text":"I had high expections upon attending Lago's NYE Gala. Everything seemed to go wrong. I did not feel welcomed as I checked in for my reservations. There was no warm greeting and absolutely a lack of professionlism coming from the host. I was not dreased in a suit or black tie such as others, but did not expect to be treated as if I was not a paying customer.

As we were escorted to be seated, the host stated rudely, \"Let's see what happens.\" I'm not sure what he meant, but when we saw where our seats were, I figured he was talking about the location of our table. Our view was obstructed from the fountains and there were not enough heaters to warm up the amount of people sitting outside. 

You pay for the experience and most importantly the food that Lago has to offer. Here is a list of where Lago has failed to meet any paying customer's or foodie's expectations:

- cocktails (whiskey sour) were made incorrectly. Watered down and egg whiteless
- bread was not offered
- the oyster shooter was disgusting. Seemed like everyone around us ignored it, hoping it would be taken away
- the lobster cannelloni was room temperature
- the main dishes were okay, temperature was correct, but again had high expectations. Hoping that this main dish would save the night. 

I bet it would have been a better experience for NYE if my money was spent on a table. Truly wished for a better experience."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Tremont from Tennessee.  I took a new job and dropped everything to move up here.  No friends, no contacts, empty apartment, but I had a job and in this economy, I jumped at the chance.  
I knew about Lolita because, let's face it, everyone on earth knows who Mike Symon is.  Of course, it was the first place I tried on a not-as-bonkers snowy Cleveland night.  But if the streets are clear, and Lolita is open, chances are, you're not getting in.  #omgThisPlaceIsSoFull  So, since Lolita was not going to work as my after work \"spot\" I tried Lago.  
I'm so glad I did.  
The staff is perfect.  Huge smiles, friendly people.  The bartenders are amazing; three Italian ladies (Nichole (co-owner), Megan and Jamie) who earnestly welcome you, pour a very generous cocktail and seem genuinely interested in how your day went.  
The atmosphere is very cozy, dark ceilings, scenic murals, wine in racks, white tablecloths, open kitchen.  
The Tremont locals are all found here, as they love the bar staff and they know this is the place with the best value.  
The food is great.  My favorites are the happy hour meatball sandwich (absolutely killer) with garlic-Parmesan chips and if I'm eating a traditional meal, hands down it's the veal tortelloni.  
Oh my freakin' god, the veal tortelloni; bacony-flavored cream sauce with pancetta, peas and that uber-crusty bread they serve.  It's just too much.  Rolling your eyes back in your head and moaning is totally appropriate when eating this thing.  Honestly, the tortelloni itself is just icing on the cake.  I could make a meal of the bread and the sauce.  
I've not had dessert, because I'm usually packed to the gills after my meal.  
The prices at Lago are on-par with everything else in Tremont.  It's not cheap, but it's not mind-numbingly expensive, either.  I don't eat there every day, but I DO drink there almost every day after work.  
I love Lago.  It's my favorite place to go in Tremont."}
{"text":"The gluten free options and ratings are what drove us here. It absolutely delivered. Great service, good wine and the mushroom gluten free pizza was actually crispy and delicious with amazing flavors. The pizza was actually big enough for two people, heads up. My friend got the zucchini noodle \"pasta\" and it was so fresh and delicious. Would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"**********LAS*VEGAS ********DEAL********ALERT***********************
*********$29***********3******COURSE*********LUNCH******************

Lago Restaurant is located in the Bellagio Hotel/Casino and Shops. This restaurant is by Julian Serrano who is a James Beard Award Wining Chef. The cuisine is Italian done in small plates with bold flavors. The atmosphere is bright and modern and elegant with a big widow with a beautiful view of the water in front of the Bellagio and a beautiful part of the Las Vegas Strip.

I came here to try the three course $29.00 Lunch.

I started with a Caprese Salad. I received the finest Heirloom Tomatoes, Creamy Buffalo Mozzarella that was dressed with quality balsamic and oil and crisp sea salt flakes. It was simple but extra delicious. It seemed like the balsamic had the smallest touch of honey in it.

My husband enjoyed the Antipasto Misto. ($5. up-charge) He received a generous plate of Burrata, Prosciutto, Porchetta, Quality Olives, roasted Red Peppers and really crisp thin breads.

Lunch was Bronzino Livornese presented on slow roasted sweet tomatoes with capers and olives. The fish had a crispy seasoned skin and the plate was finished with plump roasted Asparagus.

My husband had the Four Cheese Spinach Lasagna. It was layers of fresh made pasta with a delicious cheese filling and topped with fresh spinach in a pool of delicious tomato sauce.

Dessert was Chef's Choice and was a STUNNING MASTERPEICE**********************************

Two DETAILED layer cakes one lemon and one Chocolate with fancy chocolate art work and gold. 

Meringues.

Raspberry and Apricot sauces.

The very best Chocolate Ice

and Refreshing Lemon Ice.

Service was Amazing Too!

EVERYTHING Exceeded my expectations.

This lunch was more like a gift. I felt I got much more than I paid for."}
{"text":"Literally, don't read these reviews if you want fine dining.  This is not not fine dining.  We chose this restaurant based on the reviews and we very sadly disappointed.  The atmosphere was one step up from a coffee shop, the services was only marginal at best, and the food was tapas style, which we did know in advance and sorry we picked it.    And, if you think you can have a conversation here with your friends and family, forget that.  Oh, you could beg to sit outside, which we finally did, because I was close to walking out because it is too loud.

The pizza wasn't very good and the chicken was dry.  For what we paid for dinner for the 5 of us was outrageous for what we got.  Oh, and here was the best part.  We ordered a couple of Caesar salads for the table and when we noticed that there wasn't salt and pepper on the table, we asked our server for some pepper.  When she came with the pepper shaker, she simply slammed it down on our table for us to grind the pepper ourselves.  WHAT????  For these prices she couldn't take one second and grind the pepper over the salads?  This was the icing on the cake. 

I have never written a bad review on a restaurant before, but I did this time to let all of you know what to expect.  

Again, if you want a lovely fine dining experience, don't go here, go to Le Cirque a few steps away."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my boss. Very classy place, food was so tasty so price was definitely reasonable. Definitely go for any pasta dish. Very good brunch as well."}
{"text":"Requested a window seat via OpenTable and Lago delivered the goods. Beautiful views of the strip with the Summer moonlight and of course the infamous Bellagio fountains.

We arrived a little early prior to our reservation so we waited at the bar. I tried at least 2 of their bougie cocktails which looked too good to drink.

Pricey? Yes, it's a top tier dining venue!
Small portions? Yes, it's tapas!

But I came here to spoil myself so they're not losing stars for that. 
We ordered 5 plates to share and my fave was the lamb ragu pasta and the gnocchi.

By the end of it, I was so content I could only squeeze in dessert if it was shared.

You'll be sure to impress your date at Lago."}
{"text":"We've eaten here at least 20 times and have tried most of the menu. You can't go wrong, its all tasty. Caprese, bruschetta, red wine risotto, gnocchi a la Romana, and filletino are all particularly remarkable. Cocktails, wine, and desserts also great. Paired with excellent service and a nice setting, can't be beat. Try not to order everything that sounds good, we have over-indulged more than once."}
{"text":"Realizing I'm somewhat biased pursuant to Julian Serrano's restaurants, especially Lago, I'm going to share my thoughts anyway.  My wife and I visit Vegas at least several times per year, always reside at Bellagio, and dine almost exclusively at Lago, we love it that much.

General Manager Albert Najem is always the most gracious of hosts, ensuring each of our visits is enjoyable and memorable.

It's true, this is at times a very busy and boisterous establishment, which in my opinion, adds to the overall dining experience.  Few restaurants I'm aware of could handle this volume all the while maintaining very high quality product and service.  We've never received inadequate service here, and are especially partial to Servers Denise, Jennifer, and Marcello.  All three have award winning personalities and never fail to lavish us with truly flawless service.  I should also laud the impeccable wine service from Lead Sommelier Jeffrey Bencus.

While we've never actually encountered a disappointing dish here, a few of our personal favorites are unequivocally the Cannelloni, Linguine Al Pesto, Risotto Di Fruiti Mare, Salmon, and...the Cannoli is absolutely to die for.

We also dined last week at Picasso, which was profoundly exceptional, and I ventured over to the Aria one day for a quick bite (and wine) at Julian Serrano Tapas.

My sole ambition for flying from Wash. DC to Vegas several times per year, is to patronize Lago.  Julian Serrano's hands have truly been touched by God!  ST"}
{"text":"Wasn't extremely impressed with the food and the service was TERRIBLE!  

Atmosphere on the patio: 10/10.  The patio seating overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  The drinks were incredible.  

We ordered beef carpaccio as an appetizer which was pretty good.  My main chicken dish was extremely overcooked and dry.  

The service was horrible.  Our server was overbooked, neglected us the entire time, and literally mid order would say ok and walk away when we weren't even finished ordering.  He did this several times and was extremely hasty and rude.

Unfortunately, I probably won't return which is a shame because I loved sitting out on the patio and enjoying drinks/dinner."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love!!!

Great, service, great food, great ambience!

We got there around 5:30 and was able to get a table next to the window with a nice view of the fountain. The food here is all tapa style so don't expect to get full just off of one dish. They recommend about 3-4 dishes per person, which was about right. We ordered about 1-2 dishes at a time so that we can gauge how full we were and how many more to order.

We ordered the following:
1. We started off with the caprese. It was a great start!  It's a simple dish, but they stepped it up a notch. Instead of drizzling the balsamic vinegar over it, it actually have these balsamic vinegar \"caviar\" so that it pops in your mouth when you bite into it.  It was so good that we got another one!
2. Tonno Crudo and Salmon Crudo - not bad, but not great either...probably wouldn't order again. If I'm eating raw fish, probably should have stuck with \"Yellowtail\" restaurant next door. But I'm such a fan of sushi and crudo that I had to try it. 
3. Branzino - good tender fish
4. Capasanta (scallop) - tasted good, but felt that the scallops could have been a little bigger in size
5. 7&7 (potato gnocchi with lobster knuckle) - excellent !!!  the gnocchi had a nice crunch on the outside and very moist on the inside. The lobster add a nice elegance to the dish. 
6. Caraofi & Granch (artichoike with crab) - excellent !!! This dish, along with the 7&7 above, round out our evening very well.

I would have ordered dessert because all the pictures I saw posted were just beautiful, but frankly we were so full from dinner.

All throughout the meal, we saw one fountain show after another. Great food! Great show!  It can't get any better than this. 

Would definitely come back to Lago again. Yes, it is on the pricey side...but eating in Vegas is all about the culinary experience! So if you can afford to splurge, this is definitely the place to do it. The fact that you get a fountain show with your meal just makes you feel like you are getting a full dinner package. Thanks Lago for the lovely evening!"}
{"text":"This place sells mostly small plates! They have a very small selection of entrees but it's mostly tapa style - which means snack size.

Beautiful restaurant & wonderful views of the Bellagio water show!! The ambiance is very nice. Would definitely suggest dressy casual attire.

Make sure to make a reservation beforehand!"}
{"text":"The small plates are all very good. Prices are high as expected. Only issue was service. We wanted to place orders for more small plates after first round but could not get our waiter to return. Also wanted second bottle of wine with our first Malbec and could not find waiter or Sommelier (who was very helpful). We would have doubled our bill (6 people) but when they finally came back after initial plates were delivered we had waited long enough and requested the bill. As for specifics. The tuna was good, as was the Salumi plate. Pastas are very rich but tasty as well. Mussels were nothing of note. Hamachi was bland even with their added spicy sauce. Poor service would keep us from returning. Nice ambience and some tables have great view of fountains."}
{"text":"This Place prides itself on being very different. We came for brunch and it was just as much an experience as it was dining. Cocktails were crafted well and pretty for the wives. One of the neat things they do with their bloody Mary is an assortment of extra add ons that you can spice yourself. Kinda cool. Food is great like most places at Bellagio but it's different for sure. Must try at least once but you'll go back for sure. Try the lasagna with poached egg. Damn good!"}
{"text":"The lobster gnocchi is delicious.

Truly delicious.

I did have a few pieces of lobster that were rather chewy, so -1 star

But I definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Bunch of thieves, bad service, do not go there. 
All tapas dishes in the menu are less than 20$, the most expensive one is 25$. There are some main courses which are bigger size and can go up to 50$.
We were offered with a special dish which was white truffle risotto. The server mentioned it is an appetizer size. He did not say anything about the price. Saying its a small dish I assumed it will be around the same price as the other tapases which is around 25$.
When we got the bill I saw he charged me 70$! Apparently it had real truffle pieces. How am I suppose to know that or know that truffle is very expensive. When a dish exceeds the normal restaurant prices by 3 times more I except the server to mention it. This just feels like they try to tricked us. They knew if they tell us the price we will not  take that dish."}
{"text":"Came by with my friend for her birthday and we had an amazing time. We had a great table view by the Bellagio fountains. Service was impeccable and the food was good. We ordered a sausage/ broccoli pizza and seafood spaghetti. Both really good, the pizza was really small it was more like a kids size personal pie but delicious. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. To top it off they surprised my friend with a wonderful birthday dessert. Nice touch thank you lago!"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant! Great view, service, and food. Honestly the best brunch I had in Vegas. I went in on a Easter Sunday so the menu was different than normal. It was a three course brunch: first course, second course, and last but not least unlimited dessert! I ordered the steak and egg and the steak was so juicy and tender. I would have liked to have my eggs cooked a bit more but it was good nevertheless. I was also pleasantly surprised at the variety of dessert and freshness of the fruits! 

I also got a seat right next to the window so the fountain view was amazing! The portions look small but when I got to the end of my meal I was sad I didn't have more room in my stomach for more dessert."}
{"text":"Overall I'd probably give this place a 3.75.

Ambiance - 5
Service - 4
Food - 4
Value - 2.75
Other - 2

Inside the bellagio, with a perfect view of the fountains. This is a pretty cool spot, that I probably don't need to visit again. Here's why: if you see my ratings above, I'll start with the 2 that I said for other. This place is too dang hot to be in nicer clothes lol. The heat plus the water, and a constant opening of the door to the patio, makes for somewhat of a steam box, not sure about the rest of my party, but I was pretty uncomfortable. I just want to be refreshed while eating, not sweating.

Besides that, the restaurant is beautiful, probably better to visit during winter months. Service is really good.

Now the food, they kind of have a tapas concepts in addition to a few normal main entree selections. Everything we ate was pretty good, my issue is with the value. The tapas concept is a lot of small plates, but here, all the small plates are on the slightly expensive side. Like $17 for a small portion of pasta or risotto. Thinking back to tapas in Barcelona, dishes were like $5-8 and you would get a bunch of items. I'm not going to get a bunch of $17 items....

That being said, we did have a group of 8, and we did share some amongst ourselves. My wife and I ended up getting the clams, the sauce and bread are perfect! I also got the seafood risotto which was good, but still hungry ha. Also got one of the pastas, again, pretty good but not 5 bites $17 good lol.

It's a nice place, just not sure I would be back."}
{"text":"we came here, with children, because of the fountain-side view.  we were definitely impressed and Lago has made our list to visit again. 

great food and great views.

being on the more upscale side, there weren't too many kid-friendly plates.  we decided on a pizza and our waiter suggested a modification to the menu and it worked out great. 

this is a tapas style restaurant but we did not need to order that much to be full.  we had a pizza, 4 tapas dishes and a main dish and that was more than enough for 2 adults and 2 children

yes, more on the $ side for a family dinner but if you get outside seating for the fountains, it's worth it.  if sitting inside, i might have to think twice.  also, like most tourists, i was in shorts and a tank top.  they had no problems seating us.(we did not plan to come here or we would have dressed up a little)"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Valentine's Day, not my idea brunch. All items were menu items. No buffet, no omelet station. Don't get why they would call it brunch. Ordered a Italian sausage & peppers omelet from the menu w/ a simple salad. Who eats a salad for breakfast? Asked for rye toast dark, when meal came out the toast was dry & cold. When I asked why I was told they don't butter the toast. WTF? Omelet was fluffy but flavorless. Coffee & the side of bacon were the only worthwhile items. Would not recommend this place for breakfast. It sure as hell wasn't brunch.  My wife had the mushroom omelet, same deal. Big disappointment. This place sucked when it was in Tremont. It still sucks!!"}
{"text":"We went with a large group and had a WONDERFUL dinner!  Our group of 12 were able to get a seat on the patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was the perfect spot!  Our waiter (forgot his name) was so attentive and helpful!  The food was delicious.  Four of us shared:
- TONNO (ahi tuna)
- CAPASANTA (scallop)
- SALMONE (salmon)
- AGNELLO SCOTTADITO (lamb chops) 
- BISTECCA (steak)
- BRANZINO LIVORNESE (fish)

Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Ok so, got right in.... Sat at couch in bar.  Service was terrible and food was atrocious! I am not a complainer however there were 4 of us and not one of us had a good meal.... The menu is small plate tapas... The bruschetta was bad toast with chopped tomatoes period... Very bland no balsamic vinegar and no basil no cheese ....the pasta fagoli was like gravy.... I will save you the rest of the gory details.  Asked for one check to sign to our room.... She brought 4 checks! So bad!"}
{"text":"This place is solid.  Small plates contemporary Italian food.  The dining room is modern.  Service was good.  Pasta bolognese is good, as were all vegetable dishes.  Meat and fish were solid too."}
{"text":"Wow.....simply wow.  Another of our culinary adventures on our recent trip to Vegas.  This restaurant does not disappoint.  We absolutely love small plate set ups as we enjoy eating the most variety in the least amount of time and being able to share a meal.  On this trip we had al  cipolloto e speck, capasanta, the 7 & 7, & the fusillioro.  The cipolloto e speck is a buffalo ricotta mini pizza that was delightful.  The 7&7 consisted of potato gnocchi and lobster knuckles, the flavors were so good together.  The capasanta was so refreshing and delicate in taste.  Scallop, blood orange, and pistachio.....this flavor combination is sublime.  The fusillioro was a pasta dish with lamb ragu.  Tasty but my personal least favorite of the selection we ordered.  Which isn't against the establishment, more of a personal preference.  The other dishes were just so very unique compared to this one.  You can't go wrong with any of the items that you may order on your visit to Lago.  The drinks are fantastic also.  Mine came with a spherical ice cube with an edible flower encased in the ice.  It was a shame that it never melted enough for me to enjoy it.  

Please do yourself a favor and visit Lago when you happen to be at the Bellagio in Vegas, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We started off with their fresh bruschetta, yum!! Their polenta is creamy and rich. The service could have been improved with a more focused server but the ambiance is wonderful and great vibes! The pesto fettuccine was to die for"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Lago on several occasions for their Monday night vegetarian menu, but this evening they were our \"second choice.\" We had intended to go to Ginko down the street and had attempted to make reservations in advance, only to be told that they did not take reservations, but if we showed up by 6:30 on a Tuesday we should have no problem getting a table. When we arrived at 6:15, we were informed that all of the open tables had reservations, and since it was my birthday, we did not want to sit at the bar. We decided to walk down the street to Lago where we were greeted warmly by the hostess and wait staff, and enjoyed an impeccable meal. The server introduced us to some new menu items, and the calamari were succulent and flavorful. The house salad was an interesting combination of flavors that worked very well together, and the gnocchi was light as a feather. My husband's scallops with risotto and mango chutney were cooked perfectly and were pleasing to the palate and the plate. Too full for dessert, we were nonetheless tempted by the interesting options. I guess we will have to return to our new \"first choice\" on 
Professor."}
{"text":"Dinner here on Thanksgiving. The restaurant was packed.

They were kind enough to accommodate my request for a table by the window.

Food, service, ambiance = A+

Price range is \"$$$$\" not \"$$$\" unless you are there for drinks and snacks. \"$$$$\" is Over $61 per person and if you are here for full meal, it is easily going to be $61/pp.

My only suggestion to whoever is reading and responding to these reviews -- you need to do more for the people that have written negative reviews otherwise there is no point responding."}
{"text":"The view is about the only thing this place has going for it. Extremely high prices for extremely small portions. Average (bite sized) portion is $20 and the waiter recommends you order three plates each!! Honestly, you would probably need to order about 5 plates to be satisfied. I will be watching from the other side of the fountains next time and save myself the small fortune it costs to eat at this up tight establishment."}
{"text":"Lago is a must eat in Las Vegas if you want Italian tapas with a side of spectacular views. Located in the Bellagio, Lago has a outdoor dining area that allows you to see the fountains from the other side. We went around sunset, and the views were amazing.

The food was also really good - I recommend the Duck with Polenta, the Braised Short Ribs, and the Scallops. For drinks, I recommend trying the Lago, which is a strawberry drink that comes with an ice sphere and gold flakes. It's delicious and gorgeous at the same time!

Service was also very good - they sat us in the patio facing the water, and they let us sit there as long as we wanted, did not rush us, and brought out a lovely dessert after finding out it was one of our birthdays! 

Just an overall lovely time. I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"To preface, I visit Vegas every year. Actually twice a year. Yep I love Vegas that much. Can't help :) Lately though I haven't been blown away by restaurants on The Strip lately. Boy, I surprised myself that I enjoyed the food so much at Lago. Honestly the food was so good that I could see it succeeding in Chicago where I live. In fact if Lago was in Chicago instead, I'd make it one of my regular go-to places. 

The tuna crudo was absolutely fresh and amazing. There were only four pieces (thicker than your usual crudo for sure) but the quality truly made up for it and I'm for quality over quantity if the quality truly meets expectations). I didn't want it to end. 

The beef carpaccio was thinly sliced and refreshing. Not gonna lie -- I would have liked it better if there was less things going on top of the carpaccio. I'm a purist so maybe it's personal preference. It would be great to put the main focus on the pureness and freshness of the beef itself. Still a wonderful dish nevertheless. 

The veal was a cold dish and thinly sliced. It was my first time eating veal served this way. Very nice and not heavy!

After all the relatively light dishes, the clam spaghetti was carb heaven :) Really enjoyed it a lot.

Final important thing: Lago makes solid cocktails. I've been lately so disappointed with cocktails (mainly old fashioned and Negroni) served at places on The Strip. The old fashioned just doesn't taste as good (and I'm comparing it to Chicago, NY, London etc). Why why why. My husband ordered a negroni and I got a Boulevardier (negroni made with rye whiskey instead of gin) and both were SOLID. We later tried one of their signature cocktails made from whiskey (I forget the name) which was also solid.

It was our last night in Vegas so it made a wonderful cap to the our vacation. It definitely helped chase the coming-to-the-end-of-vacation blues away :))) I can't wait to be back.

Side note: Some reviews complained the food is overpriced. Need to be realistic. It's the Strip. It's at the Bellagio. It will be more expensive. Even a salad at the poolside is expensive. And heck even McDonalds in Vegas is expensive."}
{"text":"Very good food, beautiful view, pleasant service. One of the most memorable experiences in Las Vegas, the executive chef Nico has food art down to a science. We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"If you like very small overpriced dishes this place is for you.the pappardelle dish was the size of my hand and way too spicy to taste any of the vegetables."}
{"text":"Lago is a great spot for delicious food and a classy atmosphere. The menu is limited but everything is top notch!! They bring a DJ in on the weekends, so it will be louder and more of a fun club type feel. So, come before 10 if you want a quiet meal. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and drink options. The outside patio is a fun place to hang to soak up some of the nice Cleveland weather! They have a lot of comfy patio furniture!!!  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I only had so many dinner choice selections in my short time in Vegas, so I'm extremely happy I ended my last night with Lago. The restaurants trendy interior and appealing view of the Bellagio fountain interested me & my boyfriend and we could not have been placed in better seating. 

Our server was great. He said the chef recommends 3-4 small plates per person, but we each had two and that was plenty. We ordered the cheese plate, zuchinne pizza, polpette de carne, and the ravioli ai gamberi. Although we were pleased with the food, the view was what made my experience. 

Make sure to reserve window seating!"}
{"text":"Absolute perfection. This spot is located in the Bellagio and it doesn't disappoint. It's hip, modern and the service is outstanding. My party were gifted with the preferential treatment. That being said we were gifted with the best selections of unique items such as Grilled Branzino, Lamb Chops and that was just the tip of the iceberg. The wine selection was excellent Pinot Grigio was on FLEEK - Lol. It's outstanding and oh you even get the Bellagio Water Show experience as well."}
{"text":"One of my fave restaurants on The Strip! If you're looking for a place to eat that has the sights, ambience, and food, then reading this review is a start. :]

Out of all the times that I've dined here, I've never had any complaints. And it's funny to think that when my fam and I come here, we're seated at the same exact table every time, which is located in the patio. I would recommend getting a table in this area for first timers! Especially at night, since the water fountain show comes on about every 30 minutes at night. You'll have a perfect view! But don't worry about those nights that seem too cold. They have plenty of heat lamps all around the outside.

Customer service is always great here. Don't be afraid to ask questions on what the staff recommends. Sometimes they'll even offer suggestions that pertain to the number of guests in your group, like the customizations of portions.

All in all, it's an awesome place to dine at when looking for a nice eatery on The Strip. Pricing is not that bad, when considering this place to be more of a fine dining restaurant. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I can't say I'm huge on writing Yelp reviews, mostly because I sometimes want to keep those 'best kept secret' places to myself. After dining at Lago, it's pretty clear this place isn't going to be a secret for long! 

Admittedly, I'm horrible about actually knowing what I'm eating and at times am that \"Are you going to finish that?\" type of person, but a few home runs I certainly can't forget: 

Scallop Crudo
7&7 - Lobster and Gnocchi. Trust me. You're welcome.
Fusilli with Lamb Ragu
Focaccia with cheese and honey. 
Gnocchi with Blue Cheese - Not sure what they were actually called, you'll figure it out. 

Personally not a huge dessert person, but tried a few of them and they all were great. Other people at the table were blown away by the Tirimisu, Panna Cotta, and some sort of Nutella/Hazlenut magic. 

The real show stopper here is the atmosphere. Gorgeous dining room, brilliant patio, and no matter how hard you try you can't miss those perfect Fountain Views."}
{"text":"The view was excellent...but that's it.  Not worth the money.

I was here on a recent Saturday night with a group of 6 other people.  The troubles began right away.  We arrived at 9:00 for our 9:00 reservation.  A couple of guys were a couple of minutes late due to having to walk over from the Bellagio. The restaurant told us to let them know when the rest of the group arrived. That's fine, I understand the desire to not seat incomplete parties.   We took a seat in the bar area. BUT, by 9:06 everyone had arrived and we let them know.  Despite that, they didn't seat us until 9:30.  No apologies, no acknowledgement at all that they had botched things.  However, it could have been worse. There was another group of about 10 people that had apparently been waiting 90 minutes beyond their reservation time.

Once we sat down, the service was slooooooooow. They may have just been understaffed, I couldn't tell. But, regardless, it took forever for our waitress to take our order. It then took a long time for the food to come out, and when it did there were some mixups with the orders.

I could look past the service problems if the food was truly excellent...but it wasn't. The food was overpriced for the quality and the alcohol was absurdly expensive. $18 for a small mojito?! Really?  That being said, the cocktail was the best thing about the meal for me, but several of my friends had their drink orders screwed up (who serves a martini on the rocks in a small tumbler, honestly?).

I had mushroom risotto where the rice was significantly undercooked and the flavors were underwhelming.  I followed that up with a braised duck on top of polenta.  It was ok, but I don't feel like it was anything I couldn't have gotten at Carabba's for half the price.  My experience wasn't unique, I think everyone in my group was fairly unhappy with the experience.

There are just too many great restaurants in Vegas, including many at the Bellagio, for me to waste my time and money on a place like Lago.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great views of the fountain and excellent modern take on classic Italian. Great staff. Courteous and we'll knowledgable of the cuisine. A few favorite dishes were the 3 cheese polenta, red wine risotto and the lamb pasta. The portions are small and meant to be shared but the food is so rich that I assure you you'll feel full and slip into a food coma after dining."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Food was good at best and served warm at best.  To end the experience we must have walked past about 10 employees and not one even looked us in the eye let alone said anything.   This meal was like a cafeteria experience and not what you would expect from a Bellagio establishment."}
{"text":"Very good! Cool, trendy spot, friendly attractive staff, delicious food! I got the linguine with clams - beautiful presentation. My friend got a special for the evening - the seafood bouillabaisse. I was loaded with seafood."}
{"text":"Great view!! Food was delicious, but service staff wasn't very friendly. I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very busy, and has a great atmosphere. We visited to celebrate a friend's birthday; this celebration was intimate and fun. The food took a bit to come out, and the portions weren't big. We shared in 6 dishes, and one person ordered an entree. The food was delicious, and the vibe was energetic. The only downfall was that the restaurant was very loud. We were seated by the door to the patio, which made it very cold every time the door was opened. Overall, a great find!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks. Ordered several small plates. Everything was absolutely delicious. If you are willing to wait for seating (or make sure to get a reservation ahead of time) you can watch the fountain show from your table."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Excellent service. Cannot ask for a better dinner experience in las vegas."}
{"text":"Took my gf here for dinner. Made reservations but didn't need to with their ample seating. I've dined here 3 times. The food is excellent and the wait staff is always professional, friendly, and our waiter had a great sense of humor. We had the calamari and meatballs for apps. Then bay scallops and a pasta dish(cannot remember the name). No complaints about the food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to Lago. Overall, the experience was positive. We did not have a reservation on a Saturday night, so we had to wait about an hour. We expected this and it was not a problem because we went to a bar down the street for a few beers. The hostess called us when our table was ready. I have to say the service was kind of slow, but the food was worth the wait. We ordered the fried goat cheese as an appetizer and it was very good. I got the lobster gnocchi as my main course and it was delicious! Finally, we ordered the chocolate lava cake and it was good as well. I think the prices are a little more expensive than Lolita (which is across the street), but similar to other restaurants in Tremont."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city by far. The short rib hash was delicious and the shrimp & grits reminded me of New Orleans. Location and service was also amazing, can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"WE LOVED LAGO! My parents and husband and I celebrated my mom's 65th birthday at Julian Serrano's newest restaurant in the Bellagio, and they showed us the best time. Memorably warm and attentive service, memorably dramatic and beautiful fountain views, and memorably fun and satisfying dishes.

We had chicken liver crostinis, guanciale and fava focaccia, green and white asparagus, margherita pizza, corkscrew pasta with lamb ragu, risotto with red wine and burrata, potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles, and the softest meatballs, and this--about two dishes per person--was the perfect sized meal. My favorite dish was the risotto with red wine and burrata--it hit all of my comfort food markers for being soft and creamy and savory, and a little tangy. I also loved the chicken livers, and the doughiness of the focaccia. Was anything the best I've ever eaten? No, but nothing was remotely disappointing! This is beautiful Italian food--sometimes very subtle or simple, but always very pleasing.

A note on the cocktails and wine list--the cocktails are strong and the pours are very generous. Don't let the price tag turn you away.

I definitely want to go back, and maybe next time I'll remember to take a picture. But I don't think I'll lose the image of the fountains, and my mom's overjoyed face as a complimentary birthday dessert arrived, anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant in Ballegio Las Vegas. When you have a table outside you will see water show too for dinner Coz foe lunch they're don't have show. Also service and everything good at here."}
{"text":"Lago is a recent addition to the dining choices at Bellagio. Situated facing the lake it provides a number of great views. Patio dining situates you directly next to the water show. The interior decor is beautiful. The white walls provide a bright space highlighted by the wall decorations and accented by the dark multi color flooring. 
Our server Brian was helpful in explaining the menu and attentive in following up though out the meal. The menu provides a choice of many small plates with an option to choose a large main course. Our starter was the bruschetta which was a pretty standard arrangement. I would have preferred less crunch in the bread and more garlic. The choice of sides were roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary and a combination of green and white asparagus. The potatoes were shaped like small slices of bread and cooked perfectly. The asparagus was outstanding, cooked al dente and topped with melted Parmesan cheese. The two entrees of choice were a 4 oz. filet of beef tenderloin and a plate of veal piccata. The filet was cooked as ordered and served with a rich veal reduction on the side, juicy and tender. The veal consisted of 3 perfectly cooked pieces in a wonderful caper sauce. Brian suggested that we order 3 to 4 small plates and his recommendation was spot on, just the right amount of food. The finale was tiramisu. The Lago rendition is served with a side of ice cream that melds perfectly with the cake. The desert was exactly to our liking.

Looks like winner for chef Julian Serrano with a excellent interpretation of Italian dining."}
{"text":"Incredible tapas in a great atmosphere and excellent service. The best meal in Vegas before going to see Cirque de Soleil \"O.\""}
{"text":"This place is a must! First of all the food is great! We ordered a lot of the small plates and that totally filled us up! I liked the risottos! See the attached pictures!  Additionally, you must try to get on the balcony, it is literally the most romantic ambiance! Having the Bellagio water show going on while you eat amazing food! Michael was our waiter, he did great! Thanks to Ljubisa(Louie) for taking all our pictures for us! I also have to thank Albert for the desert!"}
{"text":"Great staff from the hostess to the waiter.  Food was delicious and tasty.  A bit pricey but most of the Vegas strip is.  Small potions for the price, otherwise I'd give it a 5 Star rating.  I'd go back for any special occasion.   Got there at the start of dinner time and we were seated front row of the Ballagio Fountain."}
{"text":"By far one of the most seamless restaurant opening nights I've ever experienced. Bravo! 

There's a buzz about this new Lago and it's made of classy, sophisticated, modern elegance and energy you can feel! Don't get me wrong, I'll always hold the charming, warmth of the old Lago location near and dear to me, but it's great to see a local business growing and evolving with the Cleveland culinary scene. 

Located in the new Aloft Hotel (which is another Cleveland win in its own right), Lago is  the official restaurant for all catering and room service in the building. And considering the delightful dishes I tasted, I seriously think the guests are lucky! The new menu boasts fresh, modern takes on authentic Italian cuisine, mixed with traditional family recipes you don't want to miss. 

When we arrived for our 8PM reservation, the place was packed to the gills with excited patrons waiting to experience the new Lago. It was a little loud and crazy, but I think as the new location excitement wears off, it will level off to a comfortable, intimate-yet-fun vibe. The service was great, not too uppity, not too lax--just the right amount of attention and talkative-ness. I think just about my only complaint of the evening would have to be the 15-20 minute wait for cocktails--which was explained to us by our server as a computer malfunction they were working on as we spoke. These kinks happen on opening nights, so I didn't mind. And when we did get our cocktails I was blown away by the clementine-esque (I forgot the exact name) one with sago. Let's just say it was my own fault for slugging it down too quickly for my own good. Also, I asked our server to bring me an \"easy drinking red with no oak\" and he brought me the most perfect wine--middle of the road price range, too! Again, great service.

On to the food: I may be biased since Italian food is probably my favorite cuisine and I've starved myself of pasta for about 4 months now--but ohmygod, yes! This is the old Lago I remembered, but even better! First, the menu looks rather large, but don't be intimidated. There's an extensive selection of cheeses, meats, olives and other antipasto to choose from that makes it look bigger than it is. I loved that they now offer smaller plates for two to share and also half orders of their homemade pasta dishes. We opted to try a bunch of lighter items and decided on the Salerno Family Meatballs (for two), Scallops with manchego polenta (for two), the chef's seasonal salad (which was big enough for two to share) and a half order of the mushroom cavatelli. 

First, the Salerno Family Meatballs are something the owners really wanted to keep on the menu and I'm so glad they did--these are some damn good meatballs. They're packed with flavor from a mix of ground meats and spices, plus the homemade marinara sauce is to die for. The two scallops were fresh, perfectly seared with a light lemon-y zest. The crispy kale and the cheesy polenta that accompanied those two beauties were also delicious. Next came the salad, which was arugula simply dressed with pickled watermelon, truffle, parmesan and was fresh, light and delicious. The mushroom cavatelli was a winner with homemade pasta and a selection of wild shrooms all dressed in a creamy, cheesy sauce that was surprisingly light! Not overly salted or garlicy, which was an unexpected plus. Lastly, since it was opening night, the Chef visited our table and brought over a trio of dessert samples, including a handmade cannoli, lemon cheesecake and my favorite, a white chocolate truffle milkshake. Yes, I'm talking about truffle, like mushroom truffles. It sounds strange, but oh dear jeezus did it work. 

A side note on parking: There is free street parking, $6 lot parking (cash only) or you can park in the hotel garage and pay with a credit card on the way out--it's super convenient!

Overall, an incredible experience that I can only expect to get better and better as we return again (and again!) Kudos, Lago! 

**Just FYI: Keep in mind I'm not a professional food critic and I did actually pay for my meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Lago is deliciouso!

In other words, it's Italian perfection in Cleveland. NOM. 

With it's super romantic interior and authentic decor, Lago truly makes you feel like you're on a mini vaca. Priceless. Nothing is better than a restaurant experience that feel like a getaway. 

On top of the visual goodies that Lago boasts, can I just say that the goat cheese tortellini was off the chain? Umm, best goat cheese experience of my life. No doubt. I crave it on a regular basis. The antipasto was the first one I've ever had and therefore set the standard for every other one I've ever tried. And trust me, they've all fallen short in comparison. 

Honestly, this is great date pick spot. It's not a cheap restaurant, but it's worth the money. The vibe is incredible and matches the deliciousness of the food. If you want to impress someone, bring them here."}
{"text":"I had a friend visiting from out of state so I decided to take him out to the famous Juliano Serrano concept Lago. We had a reservation for 2 yesterday the 22nd at 10pm for a table overviewing Bellagio fountain. The good part is that we got there and immediately we have been seated. This was all the good part of our experience.  
Now let's talk about the bad part of our experience . We have ordered a bottle of vine for the two , Caesar salads as entrees and Beef Tenderloin with grilled asparagus and roasted potatoes for main. For almost $400 dinner you would expect a nicer service but let's not get into it since we are sure nobody cares as they would fill that table up with new visitors at any given moment of the day. 
LETS TALK ABOUT THE FAMOUS FOOD OF LAGO:
Caesar Salad- 4 bottom end pieces of romain heart with sprinkled cheese and few croutons being thrown into the plate. The romaine was soft and brown,no crunch to it or anything to wow us for a plate that cost almost as a main course . 
We didn't eat the entrees and we kept sipping on the wine waiting for the main course. 
12 to 15min after the entree was served the server arrives with the main . We looked at each other and thought the same thing. Why are they pushing the food so fast on us. But anyway we started eating our main and keep staying positive enjoying the night. We have ordered the steak medium well and the asparagus grilled. What's was served to us was a bloody rare steak with 1\" thick boiled skinned asparagus. Disgusting. 
We sent the food back to get fixed . They brought back the same plate but with charbroil grill lines on the same food we sent back. The steak was black burned on the outside ,the asparagus was the same boiled product but now has nicely presented with the black grill lines on it. Still mushy and soft at bite. 
We decided not to complain anymore since they were closing and obviously didn't care about fixing their mistakes. We eat what we could, finish our vine and move on with our night.

0 starts for the service 
0 starts for the food

Never going back or recommend Juliano Serrano places. A big $400 disappointment"}
{"text":"Top 3 meal of my life. The white truffle risotto and the osso bucco were amazing. Wine was great. Service made the meal even better with great suggestions. Request a window or patio seating for great views of the fountains. I'm a local and have eaten at many of the fine dining options and Lago is among the very best. I will return."}
{"text":"I went for brunch and it was delicious! The three-course meal presented really good choices and it was a nice mix of breakfast and lunch items. Adding mimosas is a must and for a set price a great deal. The filetino was excellent. The pastries they provide upon seating were delicious. The dessert bar had a great deal of choices in sure satisfying many palettes. I haven't tried for dinner yet but it's great for celebrating special occasions, especially if you can secure window or patio seating."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. (And seated right at our reservation We had a perfect table right next to the window to see the fountains.  The small plates concept. Is good as  you get to try a number of things."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio water show, and the strip. Yummy craft cocktails, and the food is out of this world!

Our group tried:

Truffle pasta- Creamy and dreamy. 
Caprese - you could taste the sunshine in the tomatoes, and the cheese was buttery soft!
Sashimi- Bright, fresh, delicious.
Wagyu beef dish- Melt in your mouth beef, with a side of the most buttery, crispy little potatoes
Veggie Lasagna-  Cheesy, perfect pasta and sauce.

Service was stellar!"}
{"text":"Food and view are good, service on the other hand not the same, our sever was slow, never checked on us and barely spoke English"}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was a good place for inventive martini's, delectable dessert and a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. The seating area makes you think of 2 different places in one, the front area is very laid back with high top areas around the bar and the dining room is sleek and modern with seating along floor to ceiling windows with great views. One of the cocktails I tried was a raspberry bubbly and another with blood orange, both good, although the orange was on the bitter side. The dessert we shared was also raspberry and the chocolate and both were winners. By comparison, the food fell very short. We had 2 different pizettes which were both bland, and the sausage had a different texture. The caprese salad which I normally adore was bland, along with a strange flavor from the balsamic. This is not par for the coarse at a Bellagio restaurant. If the food had some flavor and a dash of seasoning, it could have been better. The pictures of the dishes deceived me, because all looked delicious."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. The restaurant is modern sheik, decor up to par plus the fountain view! Every dish I've had has been absolutely amazing! I'm just not the biggest fan of tapas, other than that I think this place is a must try. Especially for brunch, there's an endless table of deserts!"}
{"text":"Very surprised that I liked this place. Not always, but usually I find restaurants with one-word titles to be pretentious. I'm glad that I didn't judge a book by its cover and try this place out. The food is very good. The olive appetizer is probably the best olive appetizer I've ever had at a restaurant. My brother and I devoured it. We also had the Lago pizza and Campanelle. The pasta portion was perfect--not too big and not too small. The pizza was also great and came out like a flatbread. Great experience but the service was inconsistent. It was the predictable fast service until it got busy then the service falls off a cliff."}
{"text":"I expected better from Lago, specially for what each item costs. The food was mediocre. The service was worse. They must have been having bad night. I thought I was going to try food with unique flavors and leave with a good experience. I always heard these expensive Vegas casino restaurants had good eats so we figured we would give it a try one night. It was not at all what we expected and everything tasted very bland. The food was presented nice but thats about it. I'm hoping to give them another chance next time I'm in Vegas and update my review."}
{"text":"Delicious spot! We lunched and had:

- Caprese salad... eh. 
- Mushroom pizza, definite winner and very good.
- Spinach Lasagna, also delicious and licked clean. 
- Tiramisu, neither of us enjoy tiramisu, but it was their prix fixed dessert, so not much of an option. 

It's a new space, all white, behind the fountains, but gets very loud."}
{"text":"Generally enjoyed a casual dinner at Lago East Bank.  The stylish dining room has a nice view out to the river, though partially obscured by the Waterfront Line.  There was an outdoor dining area, though it was inexplicably underused despite the nice weather.

The dinner menu consists of appetizers, antipasti, pastas, full Italian dishes, pizzas, panini, and salads.  The antipasti featured five cheeses and a number of meats to choose from.  Relying on our server's recommendations, the selection of olives, cheeses, and meats we received was decent.  The lasagna was excellent, baked just enough to get a slight browning of cheese along the edges.  The lasagna is plated on top of toasted breadsticks laying on a plate of red and white sauce in a yin-yang-like pattern.  For dessert, however, the white truffle chocolate milkshake was a major miss that I couldn't stomach to finish.  The truffle paste seemed to leave the shake with a soured milk taste.  Service remained friendly and casual throughout.

Overall, I thought Lago East Bank was a decent place, and I have high hopes for the revitalization of the Flats area.  You will too if you take a post-dinner stroll away from the Ernst & Young building and into the Scooby Doo ghost town."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I came for a nice business lunch hearing about the prix fixe meal available during the weekdays.  The menu cost $28 and included an appetizer (seafood salad, minestrone, mixed plate, or caprese salad), an entree (lasagna, branzino, pizza) and then a dessert (chocolate, gelato, lemon cake).  We went with the caprese salad and lasagna for one person and the minestrone and branzino for the other.  We then shared a lemon cake and got coffees as we weren't feeling dessert at that point.  There all also options to supplement the meal with either bigger portions r better dishes, but we opted for the basic.

Overall the minestrone came with tons of veggies and the branzino was well cooked.  I was full at the end, especially with the complimentary white bread.  The lasagna was a very interesting, thinly layered variety that was quite tasty while the caprese was just your typical of that dish.  The lemon bar was very nicely crafted and exceptionally tasting.

My biggest complaint was the waitstaff.  They firstly upsold us with garlic bread when we already had regular bread.  We assumed it came complimentary but we saw otherwise when we received the check.  Second issue was the supplement pricing.  The branzino and the pollo dish we were both interested in were $29 on the lunch entree menu but the pollo dish cost an extra $8 on the lunch prix fixe.  This seemed a little weird and the waiter didn't really have an explanation when we reacted to the pricing discrepancy.  Finally, the waiter very poorly gave us alternative options when it came to dairy constraints.  I prefer not to have dairy and the only dessert offered was gelato (non-dairy?  Really?), which I don't eat, that met this criteria.  The only substitute was coffee.  I'd rather have another appetizer or price change to the menu, but I guess that's not how it works.

After a full meal it ran us about $65.  There are definitely better priced options on the strip even for lunch but with a romantic view of the fountains and quality food for the most part, Lago is a suitable option.  For a romantic or business occasion that is easy to appeal to people with all tastes, Lago is great (if you can afford it).  For a typical Vegas lunch when staying on the strip, I would go elsewhere and save your money or a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that after a long week here for work I was looking forward to enjoying a great meal as I have heard such wonderful things about the food at this restaurant. I unfortunately have to give at least one star otherwise I cannot post my comments. Although the real rating is zero stars. 

The tables are too close to each other where the staff keeps on banging Into the backs of everyone's chair including many members of our party. In addition, you have busy boys without common sense moving large trays of dirty dishes and glasses when their co-workers are in the aisle. When someone in our party asked for salt and pepper, the person brought over a grinder and proceeded to explain 'S' is for salt and 'P' for pepper. I mean how condescending is that? 

The food overall was good but the environment leaves much to be desired. The worst part is that we overheard one employee say to another \"Oh they want dessert so they're not leaving soon\". This was after only being here an hour after our reservation. 

The server was nice enough but the managers/maitre d are just walking around oblivious to the chaos that is being created. They are the ones who are supposed to manage what's going on and maintaining some sort of order. 

Maybe the majority of the diners are oblivious to the lack of care to detail, but with the reputation Julian Serrano has he should be ashamed of this restaurant. 

It's a shame. I plan to tell everyone about this horrible experience so that I can save them the hassle and suggest other restaurants where their experience will be better."}
{"text":"Lago is now closed but there will be a new wine and cocktail bar in 2013.   Fabio Salerno is going to open a new spot in Ohio City  AND the east bank of The Flats...
Loved Lago but this is more like a stock split!!! TWO more awsome restaurants and THEN something to fill in for the defunct Bar 806....

Well played Cleveland Restaurant moguls...Well played!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. This restaurant is worth a try when you're in Vegas. Located inside the Bellagio, right by Hyde lounge. When the weather is nice, do ask for outside seating. You'll get to enjoy a nice view of Bellagio fountain and Paris' Eiffel tower, while having your meal. We shared a seafood salad (insalata di mare) and an antipasto platter (antipasto misto) as appetizers. The seafood salad had a refreshing taste from the grapefruit dressing and you can't go wrong with cheese and cold meat platter. For entrees, I had the sea bass (branzino livornese) and shared the octopus dish (polpo alla diavola). Both dishes were so tasty! Seafood was cooked right and tasted fresh. Flavor was just right. Really like these two dishes! We capped off our lunch with a couple desserts, which were not only beautiful looking, but tasted great as well. Our server was very attentive. Our water was never empty. Overall, I had a great dining experience here!"}
{"text":"Seems like Lago has a few mixed reviews, but I thought it was Excellent!

I read some of the negative reviews, and they were regarding cost, or their reservation time or that they were 'under-dressed' and felt uncomfortable.  Well, if you're gonna go to a fine dining establishment, then don't wear cargo shorts and flip flops and you won't feel uncomfortable, lol.  I know this is Vegas where anything goes, but people, come on, this is a really nice place, at least dress up for it.

My date actually picked this place, and I was a little concerned that it would be an Americanized Italian place loaded with red sauce or grandma's \"gravy\", one of my least favorites things in the culinary world.  But no, it was actually REAL Italian, like from Italy.  So I was really happy and impressed.

Turns out, Julian Serrano is the Executive Chef, which makes sense as he's a great chef and a James Beard Award Recipient.  Even though he's not Italian, and actually from Spain, he's taken a Tapas-style approach to Lago, so you order a number of smaller plates, rather than entrees.  This makes for a fun dinner as you get to try a number of different dishes.  Was really great and tasty.

We ordered:

- Cocktails: Cucumber Mist (vodka, cucumbers & berries) & Rossa Bellini - were both excellent!

- Wine: Bottle of French Chablis, 2010 William Fevre - excellent, but Fevre is always excellent!

- Foccacia: Ricotta cheese with sea salt & honey - very good.

- Tonno: sushi-grade Ahi Tuna topped with orange segments - delicate and perfect.

- Beef Carpaccio: with shaved Parmesan & arugula - so rich & decadent...would even make Giuseppe Cipriani (creator of Carpaccio) proud.

- Funghi Trifolati: various Mushrooms sauteed in olive oil & garlic - so tasty.

- 7&7: Potato Gnocchi with Lobster Knuckles in a shellfish sauce - omg, the gnocchi melted in your mouth and the lobster had such good flavor, maybe my favorite dish of the night.

- Fusillioro: Abruzzo-style Corkscrew Pasta with Lamb Ragu and Ricotta Mousse...wow, delicious, and my 2nd favorite dish of the night.

- Giandujotto Dessert:  Hazelnut Cream on a chocolate shell and Espresso Gelato on a chocolate cake - both a perfect ending to a great meal!


The Ambiance was awesome and the style and feel of the restaurant is modern in true Italian-style, and GORGEOUS...no red checkered tablecloths here!  My date had requested a table next to the window where we could see the Bellagio Fountain Show in all it's glory.  Sounds cheesy, I know, but it actually wasn't - was pretty romantic actually.  Never thought I'd say that about something in Vegas of all places, haha.

Service was impeccable and the Head Sommelier, Jeffrey Bencus, knew his wine and had gone to the same Somm School as myself.  So, he brought us a few tastings throughout our meal of some really great reserve wine from the cellar - French Burgundies from the '80s & '90s, so that was really special...like REALLY, REALLY special, lol.  Thousand dollar bottles of wine were talking here, and of course, this was just a sip for each of us, but nonetheless, was phenomenal to have that tasting opportunity - thanks Jeff!

We had such a wonderful meal and evening, that we were the last ones in the restaurant, which was fun to be in such a nice, big place by yourselves, and they didn't try to rush us out.

And the cost is reasonable for a fine dining restaurant in Vegas - our meal for two with a bottle of great wine was $215, which isn't bad given the quality of the food, number of dishes we had, wine, service and ambiance.

So overall, Lago is a great place, and I almost venture to say that it's the best Quasi-Fine Dining restaurant in Vegas.  I say \"quasi\" because it doesn't have that formal or serious feeling of other fine dining establishments...like a Joel Robuchon at MGM (although I enjoy it there as well) and is slightly more casual, and fun!  

Love this place!  Come. You won't be disappointed!...unless you're wearing cargo pants or shorts...then you will be, lol."}
{"text":"Expensive, busy and loud.. Ordered cesar and caprese. Not bad.. Then ordered ribs and steak.. Portions are bigger than anticipated for small appetizer plates. Steak was good quality flavor was bland. Ribs were awful no flavor and bad after taste. Really did a lot of work reading reviews so it was just a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love the concept. I enjoy the wine list. The octopus is to die for. Service is fantastic. Amazing look and feel. Right on the Bellagio lake. You have to eat at Lago if you want to be wowed.  
Julian Serrano you did it again."}
{"text":"I'm trying to get away from giving out 5 stars but I had to in this case.....this was the first time I've ever done the small plate thing ....as an appetizer I ordered the ribs  it was 5 small ribs with a fig dipping sauce and pickled vegetables it was perfect ... For dinner was the 4oz fillet and mushrooms.... again absolutely perfect .... Also a small dessert of various ice cream/ cookies .... Fantastic ... The one thing you have to be careful of is (price wise) it can add up quickly  but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Celebrated a bachelorette dinner with 14 gals this past weekend.  They seated us within 15 min of our reservations, had excellent service, and a great meal with a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains.  It couldn't have been any better!"}
{"text":"We had brunch here this past weekend and the restaurant is beautiful with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains.  We opted for the preset 3 course special which had a great selection.  The food is tapas style so expect to get small plates that you can share.  Everything tasted great.  

Our complaint was that after we ordered, our waitress recommended an appetiser special for us to try.  It was pretty much a sashimi platter and was beautifully prepared.  Once the check arrived we saw that the sashimi platter she suggested cost more than both of our meals combined.  

Yes, I know it's my fault for not asking the price before ordering it, but the fact that she just assumed that it would be OK to throw on a $60 appetiser really says something about ethics of the server and the restaurant in general. How inconsiderate do you have to be to even suggest an appetiser of that price and not inform the guest?  I don't think will return for this reason alone.   Lesson learned."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an unassuming entrance but wow when you walk in it's opens to floor to ceiling windows and creative chandeliers. The booths look opulent and the table decor is simple but elegant. The waiters are very friendly as well. I enjoyed my meal at Lago but I would highly recommend everyone to get the prix fixe the desserts that come with it make it so worth  it. It costs about 13 individually. I had a wonderful pasta dish called Cannelloni. It was an amazing dish with rich flavors and subtle sweetness from the sauce. My only complaint is the small protons for 16 dollars they give you 4 pastas which is pretty pricey. Next time I'm for sure going to get the prix fixe. The cappers salad looked so good!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Lago was fantastic, from the setting to the service to the food and drinks. We sat outside on a beautiful fall evening, with the sights and sounds of Cleveland's Flats gradually coming back to life. It's a great menu, with lots to choose from. We had the calamari (sauteed, not fried, in a delicious tomato sauce that was perfect for dipping lots of bread in) and the homemade pasta with meatballs. It's the best of comfort food, with enough imagination and elegance to make it special. I had a delicious easy glass of pinot noir and my boyfriend had a gin martini -- we agreed it was exactly how we like our martinis: extremely cold, with just the right balance, and awesome cheese stuffed olives. Our only disappointment was the mushroom pizza--the crust is nothing special and the toppings were just ok. We were so happy (and full) at that point, the so-so pizza didn't faze us at all. We'll just stick to ordering pizza at Humble in Lakewood, and come back to Lago for the pasta. A great evening all around!"}
{"text":"loved the food and service! just a precaution you will need to order numerous items as the portions are very small"}
{"text":"While I personally did not care for their take on tiramisu, the rest of the meal was something of a transcendent experience. The quality of food, view, and service made it a top notch restaurant on the strip for us, and we will certainly return. 
We ordered from the prix fix lunch menu (extremely economical):
Caprese salad
Seafood salad
Housemade meatballs
Four cheese spinach lasagna
Lemon bar with limoncello
Tiramisu

The ingredients used were extremely fresh - the mozzarella is handpulled in house and the produce was bright, vibrant, and delicious. The seafood salad (with an incredibly bright grapefruit vinaigrette that paired very well) was really packed with fresh seafood. I saw clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp, scallops, and crab meat, and it was all perfectly cooked and chilled. 
The marinara sauce is the best I've ever eaten, and the meatballs and lasagna were really delicious. The concept is small plates to share, so you get several bites of each item, but you leave feeling very full. It allowed us to savor the food a little more, and it was a real treat. 
My husband's lemon bar was SO good, and the limoncello sorbet was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It also had meringues and mango sauce, which complemented it all very well. The tiramisu was oversoaked in espresso (in my opinion, and that's largely a palate thing) leaving it too bitter, and the white chocolate ... quenelle ... was viscous and frankly, difficult to eat. The cappuccino ice cream, however, was really delicious. 
All in all, this is a must for any visitor to the strip. If you go for a late lunch or early dinner, you'll even get fountain view seating and can watch each show from the balcony."}
{"text":"As Yelp Foodies, we always try to find the best restaurants in town.  We were recommended by my friends friend to dine here at Lago by Julian Serrano. 

We had reservations at 6:45pm and it was the perfect timing.  The sun was starting to set and we sat on the patio were we could watch the Bellagio Fountains Water Show. 

We were able to meet the award winning Chef Julian Serrano.  He was super cool and very nice.  Glad we got a picture with him.  

Our server was Fabio.  He too made our experience a memorable  one.  Oh and what are the chances, there was another Fabio in the mix and he looked like he was a manager for the patio dining area.  Both Fabio's were very funny and nice.  Thank you for taking our pictures throughout the night.  :)

TIP: The entrees are also small.

Food:   
The food are small plates so we opt to share a few dishes and had our own entrees.  
-Margherita Pizza
-Burrata with bell peppers and garlic oil
-Polpa Di Granchio E  Farro which had crabmeat, organic farro grain and confetti
-Filettino 4oz of angus beef tenderloin

My friends had other risotto dishes but I had the beef tenderloin.  The food portions yes were small however the flavors were bold.  The char on the beef yet flavorful was delicious.  

So excited to return."}
{"text":"The food was not as good as i was hoping, i saw pictures online and thought it was going to be incredible unfortunately i felt the food didn't have as much flavor as i would like and the waitress was extremely rude and no helpful. It's a beautiful restaurant with a great view but that's all it had to offer for me."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely phenomenal. Every bite was pure perfection. There wasn't anything in the restaurant that hadn't been carefully thought out. Soft opening was a grand success. This place will just get better with time... Can't wait to dine again. Perfect place for a business dinner, date, or really anytime you want to be totally blown away by the bellagio water fountains. A++"}
{"text":"Not very professional staffs, not so good food we went several times but couldn't find right taste.
Very stuck up and unkind to customers.....feel like you always getting free food.

I cannot find the reason to go anymore.....very good location thou."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place for lunch. Highly recommend the lasagna and pizza. The pre fix meal is worth it"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has 4 stars. I went here for the one \"nice\" dinner I wanted to have on my bachelorette weekend with my girls. The presentation of their staff looked put together but it was awful! They forgot some of our food, they never once offered to refill any of our waters the entire time we were there and paying was a nightmare! I could go on and on but short story... it was the one thing about Vegas that was a disappointment. The food was ok."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday dinner with a group of 10.  The water was pushy and the food was hit or miss.  The polenta (side) was the best item hands down.  The risotto was the worst.  The concept of small plates is good but each plate should be spectacular for the price and it was overall just meh"}
{"text":"The main draw of Lago is its view of the fountains and it did not disappoint. We were lucky enough to sit near the window and could easily watch each show. The restaurant would change the music at the start of each show to correspond with the display which was nice touch, though hearing my \"Heart Will Go On\" from Titanic three times during dinner was enough...

The food had some hits and misses. My table for two got 6 things to share:
-A Crab meat, artichoke, and baby greens salad- it was good but no real wow factor.
-The Alla Ricotta e Meile- Ricotta cheese and honey focaccia- SO GOOD. The ingredients were simple but delicious
-The Risotto Al vino Rosso- This was a red wine risotto with melted burrata at the bottom. I have never tasted anything like this, it was rich and incredible. I'd go back just to eat this again
-Costa Di Manzo- These short ribs had a great sauce.
-Scaloppina di Vitello- The veal piccata had great flavor, but the meat was tough.
-Creme Brule for dessert. I thought I was going to leave the meal hungry, but this dessert ensured that I did not.

Unfortunately, service here was severely lacking. We did not get out first order of drinks for about 35 minutes, other tables were seated after us and had their first round of dishes before we ordered our drinks. Often times our glasses were just sitting empty for 20-30 minutes before we were asked if we wanted another- a shame because this was a celebratory dinner and we wanted to get a little buzzed at least! The timing of the food delivery was off, no plates for long periods of times and then everything at once. At the end of the meal, we felt rushed to get out with them turning off the music, putting the lights on bright, and taking the bill from the table while we were still finishing (rude!). Why should we rush when the rest of the meal was so slow? Ultimately we would have ordered more food and drinks throughout the meal if the service had been faster, but we got sick of waiting."}
{"text":"Lago is one of the most romantic restaurants I've been to. Both the food and environment exceeded my expectations. I came here for lunch and got to sit next to the large glass window which faces the water fountain in front of bellagio. I was able to watch 2 of the water shows which was great because I didn't have to watch it outside in the Las Vegas heat. The interior of the restaurant is modern and clean. 

Lago serves Italian tapa dishes. You usually order a few dishes to share with your table. Everything I ordered was something unique which I haven't tried before. I got 4 dishes with my boyfriend which was more than enough. We ended up having leftovers.

I think this is a great place to go if you're celebrating any special occasion like anniversaries or birthdays."}
{"text":"I came to Lago during my birthday weekend with 10 other guests. Right off the bat, the open and refreshing atmosphere really makes the experience what it is and the environment is wonderful for socializing and being happy! Lago is located in the Bellagio and sits in the center overlooking the large pond/water show outside and has a clear view of the strip. Similar to its Spanish sister restaurant Julian Serrano (which I ate at the night before), Lago serves small plates with a few options for larger individual portions.  Wether you are with a large or small group, small plates really is the way to go. Not only do you get to try a maximum amount of food, but the food comes out at all different times throughout the night and really facilitates a social eating experience.  Because of the pure amount of food we ordered I was not about to try everything but ill give a run down of what I did try...

Baked Ricotta with balsamic and rocket - probably the most disappointing dish of the night. The ricotta was so bland and the tiny amount of balsamic really didn't liven it up. I was hoping they would have some sort of burrata on their menu but they don't... ($9)

Bruschetta - pretty basic, nothing extraordinary but solid (btw they come two to a plate but we doubled up which is why my photo has 4) ($7)

Margherita and Zucchine pizzas - small individual sized pizzas that come with 4 slices a piece. Best part was the crust - great fluffy texture and prepared well ($14/$11)

Insalate Sarda- I guess their play on a caprese ... white/red/green tomatoes stacked with cucumbers and topped with (again, kinda bland) ricotta cheese. a refreshing dish, nothing with crazy flavor but good. ($14)

Gnocchi Alla Romana - I'd say my favorite dish of the night - soft pillowy gnocchi topped with a gorgonzola creme sauce. The menu is a little deterring because it says it is topped with blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. It's easy to tell good gnocchi from bad, and this stuff is good ($14)

Paccheri Al Telefono - essentially lasagna. not sure why their name has a telephone refrence but hey, pretty darn good and simple lasagna ($15)

Polletto - half roasted chicken on  a bed of roasted eggplant. one of their larger plates, prepared well and the chicken was juicy and flavorful ($28)

Costa Di Manzo - braised short ribs - fall apart tender in a great reduction sauce, I highly reccomend! ($19)

Cucumber Mist Cocktail - a good go to for a refreshing fruity vodka drink plus it comes with some fresh cucumber and blueberries so you can feel healthy ($17)

There were more dishes on the table I was much too full to try, but overall I had a great dining experience here. They even brought me out a birthday dessert! Service was fast and the servers explained each dish as they came out.  Vegas dining can be a little iffy and although Lago is definitely not a cheap food destination, I'd say it's well worth a visit on your next Vegas getaway."}
{"text":"I made reservations for a bachelorette party of 15 on a Saturday evening at about 7pm.  We kindly got a courtesy call from the restaurant as a reminder and I thought that was a nice gesture they did.  Upon getting seated after checking in, we noticed our table was going to be right in between the lobby of the hotel and the edge of the restaurant.. We were hoping for a table more to the window side to see the Bellagio fountain but oh well. Because the wait time was a little longer than anticipated after our reservation time, we received complimentary champagne which was amazing! 

We then got our drinks and food ordered shortly after getting seated. I ordered the Risotto Di Fruti Di Mare which comes with lobster, scallop, shrimp, clams and tomatoes. My best friend ordered a pasta dish. Both were amazing! I really recommend the risotto. Really well done and the right portion so you're not extremely full nor hungry. There is also complimentary house bread that was offered to our table. My other friends had steak and asparagus type of entrees. Unfortunately 2 of them got really sick from their steak and I'm not quite sure why or what happened but from my experience, this place was great for me. I like the ambiance and the relaxed chic vibes. Hopefully next time I'm able to get seated at a table looking at the fountain!"}
{"text":"I almost forgot that I had a food voucher for Lago from the Yelp Gold Elite event. Luckily, I remembered to use it a few days before it expired. Without requesting it, they sat us on the patio with a great view of the fountains and Paris. 

Wanting to start out light, the Insalata sarda ($14) was good option with its ripe heirloom tomatoes and subtle salinity from the ricotta. Following that were the citrus dominated flavors combined with tuna crudo in their Tonno ($19) dish.

Almost all of the dishes after that were a hit. The 7 and 7 ($19) was my favorite, with supple yet seared gnocchi along with little nuggets of lobster meat with a savory and herbaceous salsa di crostacei. The risotto al vino rosso ($17) was a dish I sampled at the Yelp event, but had to get it again because it was so good. Less successful was the chalky and grainy chicken liver in the Fegatini di pollo ($8).

For those with smaller appetites they've got a 4oz angus beef tenderloin ($20) topped with gorgonzola. It's pre-sliced, making it easy to share with others. Likewise, the branzino livornese ($16) arrived table side cut into shareable servings. The skin was crispy, the meat was flaky, there was acidity from the tomatoes, and salt from the olives giving it varying degrees of flavor and texture. For a side, we tried the funghi trifoliate ($11) containing a few different types of mushrooms coated in olive oil and parsley.

While I'm not crazy about the futuristic decor, the concept and execution of the dishes are something I do like. Add to that a small patio with a great view and you've got a restaurant that should draw in a diverse crowd of young and old looking for an affordable meal, which is almost unheard of in the Bellagio."}
{"text":"For anyone looking for a nice dinner out in Vegas, yet not incredibly formal, Lago is a great choice! We were seated at a table just 2 over from the windows and had a wonderful view of the fountains. The music playing inside the restaurant syncs up with the show, so you feel like you're outside watching. 

As expected, the portions are quite small, but for what you get, are not overpriced in my opinion. Our server suggested 3-4 plates per person, and I think we settled on 7 total, which was plenty. The Capasanta alla Putanasca and 7&7 were my favorite!

The wine menu is extensive, with bottles ranging from $60 to several thousand. Service was great (I really do disagree with anyone else on here stating that the service is poor. It isn't.) and the servers were knowledgeable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Across the street from the more well known Lolita, Lago is a gem that deserves attention.  Excellent waitstaff and incredible food make Lago a must for anyone looking for modern, classic Italian food.  

We ordered a bottle of Reisling but the waiter informed that they were out and suggested an alternative which was perfect.

We started with a superb Caesar salad with sweet, marinated tomato,  whole anchovies and perfectly crisp Parmesan frico.
 
The Herb Crusted Chicken was moist, tender and delicious with an addictive garlic cream sauce.  Served with spinach done to perfection and fingerling potatoes, it was memorable.

The Pan Roasted Halibut was some of the best fish we've had.  Perfectly cooked, flaky and seasoned to perfection, it was accompanied by delicious swiss chard and polenta \"fries\".  The polenta was the only part of the dish that we weren't wowed by but it was still good.  

Our waiter was perfectly attentive but not distracting allowing us to enjoy the ambiance and a perfectly paced meal.  We're already planning a trip back."}
{"text":"Came with my girl friend over Memorial Day Weekend and was able to sit in the bar immediately with no waiting.

The atmosphere in Lago is upscale, trendy, blue, and chrome-y. It's almost futuristic looking. 

We had a great meal, excellent drinks, awesome dessert, and a fantastic time. Would recommend if you happen upon the Bellagio and want to check out one of the newerish spots."}
{"text":"I have been to Lago several times! The food is excellent!! A consistent issue is the manager and hostess staff's snooty attitude!!!!!! The bar staff and wait staff are more than friendly and accomodating. The website has \"casual\" listed for dress code. My husband wears consistently the same style clothing-button down shirt, knee length shorts and leather flip flop type shoes. As mentioned before, we have been to the restaurant many times, this time we were accosted at the hostess stand about my husband's foot wear being unacceptable! In addition to this we had a 6:15pm reservation and on arrival (as directed by website) requested patio seating, we were told it would be a 2 hour wait. Seatings are limited to 2 hours so.......if dinner begins at 5pm.....7pm would be second seating. I questioned the time estimate and was told a large party was expected and blah, blah.......I was upset but said we would wait and see how the \"large party\" shook out . Again, my husband's shoes were criticized in front of our guests. We went to the bar and miraculously a table on the patio became available within 30 minutes at which time my husband's footwear was again critiqued by the manager!!!!! Walking to the patio we noticed several patrons had on classic flip flops or tennis shoes!!! Not sure of the arbitrary definition of acceptable footwear. I had asked the manager the definition but he was unable to express any.  We will not be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed Lago before, but insomuch as it is my favorite spot on Earth, I must reiterate. The patio overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio at sunset is spectacular. I love nothing more than sitting on the Lago patio nearest the rails looking out at the fountains with the Eiffel Tower in the background. The wonderful wines they serve paired with the delicious food designed by Julian Serrano, and served by the fine staff are the highlight of our every visit. Our Brazilian waiter was knowledgeable about every item on the wine list, and dinner and dessert menus. He provided excellent information that guided us to perfect selections. Everything was so delicious. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this restaurant!
It was our last day in Vegas and my husband was in the mood for Italian.  I wanted something outdoors to enjoy our last bit of warm weather.  Lago was our answer.
We visited during lunch where they have a prix fix menu for $28 per person.  This includes your choice of appetizer, entree and dessert.  The restaurant is more tapas style so our server warned us about size, but we found the portions to be plenty, especially with the three courses.
We were seated pretty quickly at a nice outdoor table.  The place settings have logo cloth napkins and stylish plates.
Your server will ask if you want sparkling or still water.  If you don't request tap water you'll end up paying $8 for a bottle of Fiji water.  
We ordered the tuna appetizer.  It was a different take on ahi style tuna with a refreshing citrus flavor.  It was, however, just four small pieces, so pricey for what you got.
For appetizers we got the seafood salad and the antipasto.  Both were nicely presented with larger portions than we were expecting.  The seafood was fresh and refreshing.  I just wish there had been more lobster (but who wouldn't want more lobster).  The antipasto was arranged with meat on the bottom around the center with cheese and olives in the center.  There was enough for both of us to try some. 
My husband had the lasagna as his entree.  It has a unique look (being mostly green) but with every bite he took, there was mention of just how good the lasagna was.  I had the beef carpaccio.  It was pretty standard carpaccio but very tasty.  It was served with bread crisps.
Desserts were almost too pretty to eat!  There were two choices so we got one of each. A lemon cake with a lemon sorbet and a chocolate cake with chocolate gelato.  A perfect way to end such a lovely meal.
Courses were spaced out well and we had enough time to enjoy each without feeling rushed or like there was a lag.
We loved our experience and will return again next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lago unfortunately falls far below ones expectations. I have eaten at Julian Serrano's in Aria on several occasions, and the food their is excellent. I would expect the same from Lago. The food at Lago was no better than good. We were a party of three and tried many of the dishes on the menu. You need to order several dishes per person since this is a small plate restaurant. Some of the dishes were better than others, however overall the meal was not what we were expecting given how great Julian Serrano's is at the Aria. The view is wonderful if you get a table near the window. The sound level is horrible. In order to hear anyone at your table you need to speak in a very loud voice. The staff is very unfriendly and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Lago is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas! From the beautiful decor to the amazing staff and of course the delicious cuisine! I've never had something as simple as an heirloom tomato play with my tastes buds in such a wonderfully surprising way! I always end up going with a large group of friends so we do it family style which means I luckily get to try everything!!!!! Every dish so far has been fabulous! Can't wait to go back! Hmmmmm. Maybe that'll have to be this weekend! Thank you Julian Serrano and his team for keeping my tummy happy!"}
{"text":"I really like the idea of Italian \"tapas\", the view is perfect, it's a very hip & happening place, yet we were less than overwhelmed by the whole experience.

Even though we had a reservation, requested window front, M-life Gold, special occasion dining on a Sunday night, we had to wait more than 20 minutes for our two top table, three tables off the windows, while watching a group of six (with no reservation) walk in to a corner window table and a group of three with no reservation walk in to a window table seating.  So, when you start off on that kind of note, it's hard to overcome first impressions when there are so many choices in Vegas.

Our server was great and attentive until we ordered, and then he disappeared.  Runners delivered our food, and there was a check-in after we'd finished our dishes.  Other wait staff refilled our water and we poured our own wine (not a big deal, but really?).  The Somm did a great job of putting us on a good Barbaresco.

The restaurant smelled delicious, we saw beautiful dishes going out all around us, and we just didn't order the right things.  The salumi platter was great, as was the cheese board, but no one explained what each of the items were when the runners dropped them off.   Some we knew or could make an educated guess.  But once we chose not to have the Iberico jamon or truffle add-on, apparently we were lost causes.  The quail saltimbocca was good, but the sage overpowered the delicateness of the quail and we could have been eating any non-descript white meat.  No one asked us if we wanted dessert.  The check just appeared.

The decor is great.  Love the Mediterranean blues and water theme.  It was very noisy, with the background music and lots of hard surfaces and high ceilings, so it was difficult to carry on a conversation.

I really wanted to like Lago, and it was fine.  Good.  Acceptable.  But the overall experience just left us a bit flat.  Which is a shame because we have eaten at both Julian Serrano at Aria & Picasso.  Maybe our expectations were too high."}
{"text":"Having been to the Gold Elite Event at Lago, We were fortunate enough to come back and dine here once again via dining credit which seemed to have some reviewers purturbed at the fact. That's one of the perks of being Yelp Elite/Yelp Gold Elite status. Thats the same thing IMO when you have a  Food critic and /or food blogger coming  in for a meal and at the end, a bill is not presented? A free meal is a free meal any which way you look at it, and who doesn't love free???  Like the saying goes, \"Don't hate the playa, hate the game! LMAO!!! SMH.....

ANYWHO.....

Chef Julian Serrano and his team take your tastebuds on a culinary voyage through the regions of Italy providing you with a plethora of small plates(and they are small!)
which are meant for sharing, and so that you may experience a variety of bites too. They suggest about 3-4 plates per person, but of course, you be the judge of your appetite! Our  view overlooking the fountains added a nice romantic tough as well. If you plan to dine here, the outdoor patio is where its at.

We went straight for the jugular and ordered up the OSSO BUCCO and SQUID INK GARGANELLI WITH LOBSTER which were good(both were a bit bland, especially the lobster and polenta), but even better IMHO are the LAMB CHOPS and 7&7 LOBSTER KNUCKLES AND POTATO GNOCCHI. Another overlooked dish that is a must order is the QUAIL SALTIMBOCA. The MARGHERITA PIZZA is fit for a 4 or 5 year old, and dishes worth repeating are the SCALLOP PUTTANESCA, RISOTTO WITH TRIPE,. MUSHROOMS, AND MINT(better this time than at the Yelp event), and my favorite, the GRILLED OCTOPUS WITH SQUID INK COUSCOUS. Dessert wise, the PANNA COTTA, BIANCOMONGIARE and TIRAMISU were a great end to our meal.

We received spectacular service from start to finish which made up for the minimal hiccups on the food. Dine outdoors for the awesome view and savor each and every bite! ALOHA!!!

{"text":"I visited recently with two amazing friends I have not seen in a year. This was definitely a special pre dinner meet for us. I have the say that the extravagant bill we had was mainly for the view -- which was, without a doubt, one of the Best on all of Las Vegas Strip. 

We started with a bottle of Chardonnay and muscles. Both were delicious but not to Die for. My girlfriends and I  were enamored with each other after such a long time, that everything was amazing. 

Next came the cold cuts and cheese. The presentation really lacked for me and the meats was a little warm but tasty. Lots of fatty bits. The pieces of cheese were embarrassing. I've had bigger chunks from a Whole Foods sample plate. There wasn't anything to Die for on that plate for me. 

Next came the mushroom ravioli. The serving had 3 or 4 small ravioli. I think it was 3. Again, it was very delicious but not to Die for. 

Then came a second bottle of wine and red wine risotto. The risotto was very good but that's all it was. Just risotto. We enjoyed it but it's not a dish I will crave. 

Our pre dinner apps and wine cost us over $200. That is absolutely insane to me. I've been living in Las Vegas for over a decade and I've gotten used to the Off The Strip quality, decadence and luxury of fine local dinning that sources responsibly and with quality experience in mind as well but at half of the cost. 

Corkage fee at Lago is $50. So sorry, I'm used to excellent service at places like Echo & Rig that offer free corkage at any time.

My stars are for the incredible decor, great service and a breathtaking view. The food did not win my palate. I enjoyed the company of my great friends and glad I got to experience this place, but for an experienced local Las Vegas foodie, we know where to find a killer meal/app teaser where the view won't matter a single bit."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having lunch here with my family on Friday and I have to say I was blown away with the entire experience! Our servers were excellent, the food was amazing, and the ambiance was perfect! Thank you for the entire Lago team for delivering a beautiful lunch for my family and I. We will never forget the service we had and the attention to detail everyone had. We were celebrating my brothers birthday and because of this lunch they had a wonderful birthday!  Everyone went above and beyond to make sure that we had an unforgettable time. This wasn't my first time at Lago and it definitely won't be the last. Thank you again for giving us one the best memories we will ever have in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow. Incredible. Completely amazing. I was initially stressed that a post-dinner Italian food coma was going to hinder my evening.  The waiter assured me that would not be the case because everything is small plates to share. I had tastes of caesar salad, zucchini pizza, meatballs, vegetable pasta and filet.  I can't decide which I liked better--the meatballs or the filet--both melted in my mouth. The beautiful setting, the dancing fountains, the service, the food and the company gave way to a perfect Las Vegas dinner.  Thank you, Lago."}
{"text":"Hit list:
Weird vibe from the hostesses.
Took 45 mins to be seated when we were told it would take 10.
Waitress forgot our drink order (they did comp the first round)
Food was ok, there were a handful of sublime dishes, but also some huge misses.
Overall, not worth the hype and PR to be on a must try Vegas list."}
{"text":"I don't think it gets much better than this in Vegas: the view, the atmosphere, the food and the cocktails were all AMAZING!

*The view 5/5: we were luckily seated next to the window so we were able to see the Bellagio fountain show from our table like 4 times during our meal. 

*The atmosphere 5/5: very white and sleek. Modern yet simple. It makes the view the focal point.

*The food 4/5: tapas style Italian dishes. They had some larger dishes but we opted for 2 smaller ones each to try a variety. Everything was delicious: 
-Margherita pizza: delicious thin crust with fresh ingredients. So good.
-Octopus with squid ink couscous: my favorite. Very tasty although you have to eat it right away because we let it sit for a while and the couscous tasted a bit more oily afterwards.
-Duck with polenta: tasted more like short rib but still very good and soft.
-Kobe beef: super tender although a bit tiny. Even the potatoes were bigger.
-7&7 gnocchi and lobster: just what you'd expect
-Mussels: they give you plenty of bread so you can soak them in their tasty broth
-Raspberry mousse dessert

*The cocktails 5/5: they were the highlight of the meal. Not only did they look beautiful with creative elements but they tasted good and were strong. Mine had prosecco and juice and was topped with a beautiful sugar crown that tasted like cotton candy and a gold raspberry

Prices were not bad but portions were small so you need at least 2 dishes to get full.  Service was great. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"In my honest opinion, this place isn't worth the hype. Everything is way too overpriced, although I can't really complain about that because we knew it was pricey beforehand. Our server was very friendly, my wine was delicious, and the views were pretty. However, the portions are very small for the price you pay and my husband also got very sick after dinner. Not sure if it was his drink (tasted funny) or his food."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here late on a saturday night. We were there at the hotel scoping it out for our wedding as a place for our guests to stay at. We arrive pretty late so we couldnt eat off the dinner menu but did order off the late night menu. We both had the simple salad and split a lago pizza. Both were very good. Service was great. They had a dj spinning some great music. Overall great experience and wouldnt mind to go back and check out their dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Bright and colorful ambience. Innovative small Italian plates by Julian Serrano. Had an heirloom tomato salad with romaine lettuce drizzled with olive oil and fresh lemon. Combined this with the pappardelle vegetable ragu."}
{"text":"The place is amazing the food even better. We order pizza margarita , squid , lobster and lamb ..... the taste was amazing something that we. Ever taste it before very recommended"}
{"text":"My solo lunch was delicious  
ZUCCA ALLO ZENZERO
summer squash puree | ginger | spicy croutons & POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO

{"text":"Ambience: 5
Food: 4 
Service by Monique D: 3 
I could rate it an overall 4 stars but taking into account the type of restaurant this is and what I expected of it I shall give it 3 stars instead.
My pasta ai frutti di mare was delicious but the veal piccata just had too many capers for my taste. From that dish all I could taste was lemon and capers. 
Also take into account that the dishes do not come with any sides; those you need to order separately. 
For dessert I had their Gianduiotto and it was beautiful, refined and had a nice flavor/texture combination. But would I order it again? Probably not. 
As for the service I'd say it that although sufficiently efficient it was as impersonal as it can get. Monique D, at least three times, left me with half my question still being processed by my brain. That's unacceptable. She had two tables, both close, so I know it was not because she was 'on the weeds'. Was it because I'm young and look like I could also eat at Pizza Hut?
To top it off, when she dropped the bill, she had charged one of the items as if it had been dinner time and it was not. The difference was small of course but still a mistake. I did not tell her to fix it (she was not around much), nor did I tip her my usual 20%. Hope she gets better at her job, smiles once in a while or just considers changing her job."}
{"text":"Want to experience Michelin starred and James Beard awarded rated Chef Julian Serrano's culinary offerings in the Bellagio?  Oh, chef's name may invoke his Spanish heritage and one's thoughts go to dishes that would include chorizos, sangria, tapas or paella. But, think again...you're IN THE BELLAGIO!  So, in Lago, you'll find Chef Serrano's bold Italian cuisine for brunch or dinner service.  

We came here to experience the Sunday Brunch that was highly recommended by friends and the hotel's concierge.  Reservations are definitely recommended.  Upon approach, this bright space and colorful mosaic (of Milan) attracted us from the casino.  We also noted that a dessert display had been set up at the front of restaurant.  There is also a lobby or lounge to wait for the rest of your party to arrive as the hostesses won't seat your party unless everyone is present.

As we were guided to our table, past the bar and lounge area, we could see out of the huge glass window from which we clearly viewed a panorama of The Fountains of Bellagio.  During our brunch, we watched the fountains dance about to popular or classical music selections.  Our friendly server described the fixed Sunday 3-Course Brunch menu which included a basket of assorted Italian breakfast pastries AND a \"visit\" to the dessert display.  For a few dollars more, you can request unlimited Bloody Marys or Mimosas with your brunch which makes more sense than ordering by the glass.

We each selected our 1st and 2nd courses from the menu while munching on the pastries set at our table and sipped on our coffees or cocktails.  The third course was a trip to the luscious dessert bar which we did our best to save room in our stomachs for.  The nice thing about the 3-course brunch is that the portions are sensible and satisfying so you won't feel like you'll go into a food coma.  The authentic Italian flavors can range from bright to bold which are great for waking one up.

This was a sophisticated and enjoyable Sunday Brunch which we shared  with good friends over a stunning view of Lake Lago and the famous Bellagio Fountains."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for a birthday, and was less than impressed. I would've given the place two stars only, but they deserve an extra star because of their overall good service. I ordered the kobe carpacchio, which was okay. The linguine and clams tasted like buttered noodles with a couple clams thrown in. I didn't try the pizza but it looked better. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"First disappointment....after reserving and making a special request 6 weeks ago it was totally ignored. Request was for seating close to fountain show due to the evening being our anniversary.  We even had the concierge check to be sure the request was in. There were many tables along the area close to the show so not sure why one could not be for us, considering that we were guests of the hotel for the week.  We were seated at the back of a huge room that was packed like a cafeteria with tables only inches apart. The noise level was so that we could hardly talk to each other....not a great setting for a special night.  We asked to be seated outside...no tables for us there....so we opted for a small table in a side room.  So, warning to folks who make requests...maybe if you are a Platinum member, but don't be too confident if not.  Service was good...almost too quick...only five minutes between orders....we were done and out within an hour including dessert.  Food was OK, but considering the prices, not exceptional.  Unless you are guaranteed a front row view of the fountain show, don't waste your money.  The next day we had just the opposite experience at Sinatra's in the Encore....so worth every penny....I should say every dollar."}
{"text":"I had a really great time here with my in laws. I had a great evening here and the food overall was really tasty. The service was top notch, and there is a casual but ritzy ambience here. 

Favorites: 
Salsiccia Pizza- Don't underestimate their pizzas here. This sausage pizza was super yummy!! 
Brodetto Di Vongole- The white wine sauce on this with the toasted bread was perfect. 
Osso Buco- Super Delicious. Very rich umami and satisfying. 

Least Favorites: 
Squid Ink Pasta- Garnganelli- not worth the money in my opinion. I've had better squid ink and the dish isn't that filling. 
Risotto Di Fuiti Di Mare- This was a decent dish but nothing super special here."}
{"text":"I sorta don't want to tell everyone about this undiscovered gem because I don't want it to get too crowded for me. 

But Lago really does rock.

It's my favorite happy hour destination, by far, because it not only goes later than most (until 8 p.m.!), but also has delicious food and drink deals (half off!). You have to sit at the bar to get happy hour prices, but it's cozy. Pizza is yum, as is the veggie salad, the hummus, etc."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a patio table a few days ago. Tonight it rained. This meant the patio was closed. We ended up waiting a bit on our reservation so they could fit us in for a fountain view table. They sat us as soon as they could at a four top, jut the two of us. Before we got too settled in, I think we had just ordered drinks, a manager asked us if we would mind at all moving one table over to a two top. We had already offered the other two spots at our table to a nice couple we met while waiting. We didn't mind at all. They brought a complimentary bottle of champagne for the trouble. 

Dinner was very good. We each got a salad and a pasta dish. Flavorful, good sized portions. We shared as well. 

Desert was very good. I don't remember the name but it was delicious. My fiancé picked it out so of course it was chocolate. It did have hazelnuts.

The bill was very reasonable considering the quality and location. I would definitely recommend a stop at Lago if you can swing it. Definitely make a reservation."}
{"text":"We came for the view and the food and weren't disappointed in either area. We had requested a seat on the patio and they were able to accommodate. The view was spectacular and it was exciting to see the Bellagio fountain from the other side. Our food was incredible and the small plates were just the right amount. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. We even were served a special dessert for our anniversary, which was incredible. I would highly recommend Lago for a special night out."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Pretentious food. Not the best quality. Servers were nice, polite and friendly. Atmosphere was nice too. Nestled in the popular Flats area. Will never be returning since.....why would you?!! When the food tastes so bad? We got some pasta and it tasted worse than lean cuisine that was sitting in the hot sun for 7 days and then frozen, reheated and served. I really feel bad writing a scathing review but this is the kind of feedback that helps them make positive changes. On second thought I might give it another shot if all the restaurants in Cleveland apart from this one were destroyed in a fire. Sorry."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing....and THE FOOD HERE IS AMAZING!!!! I had great service, a tasty meal and a couple of delicious scotches which produced a great experience and fun evening all at the same time. I have been back numerous times since my first experience just for drinks at the bar and ALWAYS have a blast when chatting it up with Karissa and the other bar tenders as they are some of the most fun and sweetest ladies in Cleveland.... Stop in to enjoy this spot... You won't be let down!!!!"}
{"text":"Came with a friend for the yelp event and ended up leaving while they stayed. Before the event started I sat at a nearly empty bar for ten minutes while the bartender just looked at me and kept walking by without me being able to order a drink. I'm sorry, but this will make me leave your restaurant faster than anything else.  Don't give me a sour look, dude behind the bar.  Just take my drink order.  I'm trying to give you my money because you have Kwak on tap and I don't need you making that difficult.  I left and went next door to Willeyville (spoiler alert: go there instead).

So I'm not sure if the food in this place is actually any good or not, but I'm not in a hurry to come back and find out. I'm sure it'll be great for the tourists staying at the hotel but from what I saw of the prices and menu I've got plenty of other places in town to choose from. Nothing special going on here.  If you find yourself in this area just skip Lago and go one more restaurant North."}
{"text":"I took my wife to Lago for a romantic dinner. We were offered a high-top table since we didn't have a reservation. Initially concerned that this would knock the romance factor down, I needn't have worried. The seating gave us a great view of the restaurant and the Bellagio fountains. Our server, Lorenzo, was extremely attentive, as was the rest of the staff. The tapas-sized portions were just right, allowing us to eat without feeling stuffed. We very much enjoyed the red wine risotto, spaghetti with clams and fresh fresh tomatoes, asparagus spears, and the cheese plate. The caprese was a bit light on the balsamic for my taste, but was nevertheless flavorful. Chef Serrano came out to say hello and was very gracious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food and service were awesome!!! I sat outside and watched the fountain show, can't expect more!!! Strongly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The food was enjoyable but the experience was soured by the unprofessional, and To be quite frank,  
Tacky hostess staff.  As a party spending several hundreds of dollars, you would hope the hostess staff would start your experience with class.  I would be embarrassed to bring coworkers or family here based on the \"check in\" experience.  Thankfully the waitstaff and cuisine redeemed our experience.  Once you make it past the unwelcoming, unapproachable and unpleasant hostess staff, you encounter a fun, satiating dining experience."}
{"text":"The meal, the view and the service were excellent.  I had read a few reviews that almost caused me to back out of our reservation but my wife and I decided to go and we were both so glad we did. The views were amazing looking over the Bellaigio fountains with a view of the Paris Hotel across the street. We ordered 5 plates off the tapas style menu and enjoyed all with the duck being our favorite.  We ended the meal with coffee and cannolis that were the best I have ever had.  Don't miss this place.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I am a Las Vegas local, and just had lunch at Lago at the Bellagio hotel for the first time this past weekend. All I can say is that I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by this place! The view, the food, and the service were all top notch in my opinion! The outside patio isn't very big, so I am assuming there might be a bit of a wait in the evenings, but I can assure you it would absolutely be worth it for the view that you will get of the fountains while you eat! Monique was my server, and I could not have been any more impressed by how knowledgable she was of the menu. She was also super sweet and personable and provided top quality service. Even Gerti, the assistant manager, came over to see how everything was going. That was very classy in my opinion. And he was also extremely friendly and personable. It's safe to say I have a new favorite dining place here in Vegas, and am looking forward to taking my mom here when she comes to visit next week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It's located inside the bellagio,  literally over looking the water fountains.  I've been to vegas countless times and have walked past the bellagio fountains a million times without really giving it a second thought.  BUT inside this restaurant,  these fountains really come to life.  It's truly an experience because you are so close to them, you could feel the mist from the water.  Additionally,  it's synchronize to music, which I've never noticed before.  The entire ambiance on the patio is literally breath taking.  The food is spectacular.  Smaller tapas style, great twist on Spanish and Italian flavors.  My favorite were the octopus with squid ink cous cous and the lobster gnocchi.  Expect to spend at least $100/person if you're coming hungry.  However, totally worth it compared to the competitions along the strip. Drinks are a little on the pricey side, but packs a punch. Overall amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":"Pssstt, Julian, stick to tapas!

My wife and I love Picasso and we've eaten at Julian Serrano's about half a dozen times.  \"Go check out Julian Serrano's at the Aria,\" we tell people when they ask us where to eat.   We'll make sure to tell them to stay away from Lago from now on.

I've already gotten some rather brutal feedback on my review so I'm editing it to provide more information as to why we were so incredibly disappointed with our meal at Lago.   First and foremost, service was extremely spotty.   We were initially seated at a table, immediately told to move as there could be no table there as it was blocking the doors onto the balcony.   We were moved to a table nearby only to see that a new larger table of 6 was dressed exactly in the same spot some 15 minutes later.   Perhaps they didn't want to sacrifice such \"prime\" real estate on a 2-top, but we certainly felt slighted to say the least.   For the remainder of the meal, it was evident the servers were much more interested in lavishing attention on larger parties.   We asked twice for water refill while our glasses remained empty.   Sorry, but that just doesn't fly.

The food was simply not all that spectacular.   The octopus dish I had was rather chewy with a rather crude presentation, in my opinion.   The polenta might have been the highlight of the meal, but that's really not saying much.

In all fairness, it's perfectly evident that an extraordinary Spanish Chef can create incredible tapas but he may not so easily be able to create such exquisite Italian dishes.   If you want incredible French fare, go eat at a restaurant run by a French Chef.   Same goes for Spain, Italy, or Thailand.

Considering we dropped close to 5 bills on our meal here, we had much higher expectations.   Of course, many things can be excused.   Perhaps the sous-chef was ill that day.   Nevertheless, the lack of culinary depth combined with what we thought rather poor customer service made that we certainly won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Lago. (4.25 stars).

\"Lago: lake.\" - Google

I'm not 100% certain, but if I had to guess, Lago was given it's name due to the fact that it is faces the infamous \"Fountains of Bellagio\".

Hmm... fountain, lake, potato, potatoe??

I have been to Lago at least 10 times throughout my years of staying at the Bellagio & have enjoyed dining here for a quick meal or a \"date night\" with the BF.

While Lago is a primarily an Italian restaurant, Chef Julian Serrano's creative twist on these iconic Italian dishes will surprise u.

Over the years, I have tried numerous dishes from Lago so instead of trying to squeeze every single dish into this review, I'll review my 2 favorites:

Lasagna. (4.5 stars).

I love lasagna!!

Since I was a kid, that was the one meal I asked for everyday! Garfield was my hero because he got to enjoy lasagna all the time!!

On a recent stay at the Bellagio, our friends joined us for Sunday Brunch at Lago.

The first thing I saw was Lasagna!!

Not having any clue as to what twist Chef Serrano would give this classic dish, I just blindly ordered & prayed for the best!

What I got was a stunning & colorful dish which didn't look terribly familiar to me.

When I found out there were poached eggs served with this lasagna I started to regret my decision... until I took a bite into the lasagna.

This is where \"looks can be deceiving\" is so apropos!!

This lasagna was one of the best I have had.

Why?! Because the spinach lasagna is light & cooked al dente with a savory meat sauce. The poached eggs at a richness & classiness to this dish that I didn't expect!!??

The outer crust creates a nice textural difference to help contrast the creamy & silky lasagna.

Wow, I was blown away by the simplicity but depth of flavors!! Extremely light but just as good as the original!!

There's very little cheese in this dish but I didn't even miss it!

The only thing I wish I could have had was some type of familiar protein (i.e. shrimp or sausage).

But I truly respect Chef Serrano's genius & can still say I LOVED this lasagna!!

I'll definitely order it again.

Antipasto Misto. (4 stars).

WARNING: NONE OF THE OLIVES ARE PITTED!!!

I absolutely adore olives & cured meats!!

Who cares that it may take 5-10 years off my life?! I rather live happy then miserable.

Having said that, this appetizer is spectacular... well with one exception.

The \"cracker\" that is served with this appetizer is EXTREMELY THIN. While that isn't a bad thing in & of itself, it barely holds the weight of a piece of cured meat, let alone the cheese or olives.

When I try to \"spread\" the cheese on the cracker it completely falls apart & then my poor olive rolls off my plate & onto the floor. I have lost many a poor olive to this tragic demise...

Very aggravating & heartbreaking for someone who ADORES the flavors of this dish!!!

Perhaps, my uneducated & simpleton self doesn't know how to construct this dish any better but it is still worth the aggravation to make a perfect bite for the BF & I to devour.

Note: this appetizer is very messy to construct. The bell peppers, oils, & cheese are very slippery & virtually impossible to put together with the fork given. I don't allow the BF to touch the dish, I construct everything. Aren't I just so sweet!? *Angelic smile*

---

I'm not a foodie. The true meaning of a foodie a person who is a gourmet or connoisseur!! I just love food (except fast food)!!

Lago is a wonderful place to come & enjoy a modern twist on Italian cuisine & to try some of their signature cocktails!!

Chef Serrano, a 2-time James Beard Award Winning Chef, is usually in the kitchen hard at work at either Lago or Picasso (where Chef Serrano is the Executive Chef) & I have had the pleasure of meeting Chef on a 2 occasions. A very humble & fun-loving chef!!

---

Service is always pleasant & if u get a chance, request a seat in the back of the restaurant.

Why?? The Fountains of Bellagio will greet u every hour on the hour!

I tried the Serrano Negroni. Interesting, a little sweet for my palate but the BF enjoyed my drink. LOL. I'll be back to try another cocktail on my next visit!

Sunday Brunch is available every Sunday from 1030-1430. WELL WORTH THE $38/pp price! U can also add a BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA, BLOODY MARY, OR BELLINI for $28/pp. 3 course meal includes appetizer, entree, & dessert.

Gracias Chef Serrano for a marvelous dining experience that has been ongoing since April 2015 (when Lago opened at the now defunct Circo)."}
{"text":"Giving it one star out of courtesy to the Bellagio. Would be great... for airplane food. Even the display of the food resembles that of an airline... and not even business class. Terrible in all aspects, parmesan cheese tasted like it came straight out of a Kraft's container and the caesar salad was just rude. Would not recommend this to anyone. Only good thing was the view of the dancing fountains."}
{"text":"Veritably Italian dining! Lasagna ($19) was a mouth-watering melting delight! I would go again any time! Very professional servers. Things done right, from food to drinks to views: wonderful fountain view. Make sure you make your reservations for after dark so you can really enjoy the Bellagio water show. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat at Lago before going to \"O\" (which is a great show).  It is a Julian Serrano restaurant. We made reservations well before coming here in order to get a table by the window to see the great Bellagio water shows.  

The interior is light and beautiful.  The waiters are in these blue uniforms that are kind of odd (the black uniforms that the bus people wear look better).  Our waiter was from Italy.  He was excellent, both with some recommendations and in service.  They also have an extensive wine list.  The sommelier helped us pick out a great Italian red.

When ordering, you have the choice to get smaller plates or a big plates.  I decided on four of the smaller plates (which was perfect for someone with a good appetite) while my friend opted for the bigger plate.

We started with the Caprese salad.  It was incredible.  It came with three slices of perfect tomatoes (two red, one orange), great mozzarella (that complemented the tomatoes to a T), and then a dollop of caviar.  It was magic in my mouth, definitely worth getting.

He brought out two of the small plates to start, short rib cannelloni and the Carciofi E Granchio (which is artichoke and crab).  Both were excellent.  The short rib is puled so that you can cut through it with a fork.  The pasta surrounded it was fresh and so good.  Then the tomato sauce and cheese was heavenly--great dish.  I also loved the artichoke dish.  The mix of vegetables with the crab and parmesan cheese was just right--and it matched well with the short rib pasta.

The brought out the main dish with the final two small plates.  I was brought the risotto di fruti di mare (seafood risotto) and a four ounce filet, while my date ordered the filleto (the eight ounce filet). The one negative point about the meal was that both steaks were overcooked.  We both ordered them medium rare.  Mine was a little overcooked, while my friends was cooked at medium.  They ended up comping the big steak, so we were pleased with that.  Even though mine was slight overcooked, it was still good with a great sear and nice flavoring.

Out of many great plates, the risotto might have been my favorite.  The rice was cooked perfectly and the way it was flavored by the seafood made it just heavenly.  I easily could have eaten a large portion of this--really tasty.

Although full, our waiter brought over a tablet that had photos of dessert--and we were compelled to order  I had Giandujotto while my friend had the creme brulee.  My dessert came with two cookies, one covered with hazelnut mousse and the other with a vanilla cream.    Both were very good.  The creme brulee was good also--they put it in a wide, thin bowl so that you had more of the carmelized, crusty top.

This was just a fantastic meal overall--but if I were to go again I would stick to the Italian dishes exclusively."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with my husband and had such a lovely time! We made reservations right at 11 a.m. but arrived a few minutes earlier and got seated without any issues. In fact, thanks to arriving early, we got priority seating close to the window and had the best view of the fountain show! The show began promptly at 11 a.m. with the National Anthem and was followed by another song. My husband and I opted for the three-course brunch with bottomless drinks - what a treat! I ordered the antipasto salad & my husband the truffle ravioli which was to die for. Honestly, you can't go wrong with truffle anything. Next up I ordered the Italian sausage burger with a fried egg on top and my husband the eggplant parmigiana eggs benedict, which was a tasty twist to the traditional way to serve it. My burger was delicious, and came with a salad, and I actually enjoyed that the burger wasn't such a huge & unmanageable serving. Last but not least, the dessert bar! They have strawberries, brownies and other goodies on skewers that you can dip into a chocolate fountain, or if you prefer, pick from an array of small cakes and tarts instead (or get one of each like I did). Service was impeccable, and the drinks were delish and served immediately despite me switching from bloody Mary's, Bellinis and mimosas each time around. I look forward to my next visit to Vegas and dining once again at Lago!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the view of the fountains!
This place is rather loud though.  I can't say it's a good place for a business dinner - we were yelling across the table.  

Most of the food was decent...we did a chefs choice tasting and I'm not sure I can tell you most of what we had.  My favorite as the ground veal stuffed in ravioli with mushrooms.  I would avoid the margarita pizza... Really bland.  I would also avoid dessert - we got a sampling and nothing was worth the calorie investment."}
{"text":"Great view.  Went for drinks.  Average prices for this place."}
{"text":"We were at Lago about a week ago on a Saturday night about 10:30pm. The hostess was kind, efficient and we had FABULOUS seats on the patio. The wait staff were for the most part very good, food came out as it was ready. Loved the tapas and cocktails. Our favs were: the clams and spaghetti, the meatballs, bruschetta (and I rarely like any raw tomatoes) and the gnocchi. All excellent. The mussels and the artichoke crab dish, not so much. 

The waiter was a little slow with the refills on the wine and water, but given that we were so close to the bellagio fountains and the dishes we liked were so yummy, it's still 5 stars! I would highly recommend (it's pricey, but what the hell, it's vegas!) and I plan to return."}
{"text":"We had dinner here to celebrate my guys big birthday! The food was was fantastic & just the right size! Tasty little tapas dishes @ we loved them all!
 They even gave the birthday boy a complimentary dessert the had \"happy birthday\" written on the plate!  Our server was excellent & made sure we got got out on time for our show"}
{"text":"Been to many nice restaurants in Vegas and beyond.  This one was pretentious.  Asked if we had reservations and we said no.  Hostess gave us a mean look.  Restaurant was barely alive (as with most of Vegas for this time of year)with people bc of the the unfortunate event in Oct.  Asked for a seat by the window and they said ok.  Was put at a table that was furthest from the window possible when there were empty tables everywhere.  Wanted dessert only and waiter had to ask the manager for approval.  Did I mention there was hardly anyone in the restaurant?  Should have left right then and there.  But stayed and regretted the snooty service.  

These kind of nonsense makes my blood boil.  Dessert sucked bc the service was the worst ever.  Don't go here unless you like to be treated this way."}
{"text":"My party and I enjoyed our dinner at Lago, at a table right next to the window for an excellent unobstructed view of the performing Fountains of Bellagio. We enjoyed our meal of many little dishes and the excellent service. Because I enjoyed myself so much at Lago, my uploaded pictures have minimal captions. lol"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the view from the restaurant is incredible,  unfortunately for my family we got stuck at Bellagio right about check out time, there was a shooting on the strip so we waited about 5hrs; my son got hungry so we decided to try LAGO. We have been to many many restaurants on the strip and this restaurant has HORRIBLE customer service, we were hardly acknowledge by our waitress maybe because we were dressed extra casual but her attitude was not welcoming at all, I decided not to eat because I just didn't want to spend a dime so I only ordered the short rib for my son.  He says it was great again we were never asked if we needed anything or how was the food I mean even to pay was a hassle, my husband got tired of waiting so he left and I literally had to walk by the register area to hand her $30  and left.  Food was great according to my son but it gets clouded by the bad service this restaurant offers. 

Will not return to this place.  Maybe they need to learn a thing or two from Gordon Ramsay's restaurants."}
{"text":"bellagio is known for the dancing water.. so to eat while enjoying the view is like a cherry on top of a super duper good ice cream!

when eating out, i always look for three things.
1. service
2.food/quality
3. ambience

i gave 5 stars for all three category..
service is awesome!!!! our server carlos, is so patient when asked if he can take a picture of us. he's busy but he always do so with a smile.

the food... isss superb!! from water to dessert. it's amazingggggg..

and the ambience... the picture will speak for itself... 
if you're looking for something new... don't look elsewhere.. dine in here. now. noowwwww!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this beautiful restaurant, got to experience the water show live so close to our table!! Of course I have to mention the amazing food quality and service. Flawless service from Bellisima Brazilian sweetheart Monique. Thank you again for making my husband and I night so special!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and we won't be back again. The atmosphere is nice but it's entirely too pricey for what you get. I had the Ceasar salad and it tasted like fish and came out warm. My fiancé's pasta dish completely lacked flavor and the texture was terrible. The final bill did not reflect the quality of food that we had either time. There are too many amazing restaurants in Cleveland for us to waste our money at this place. Overpriced and under whelming. It wasn't busy either time on a weekend evening so I doubt they'll be in business long."}
{"text":"So happy to have this new spot at Bellagio! Took over Circo which was also Italian. Chef Serrano brings in his own taste for Italian and love for Mediterranean food and basically made a wonderful new addition to the Bellagio property!! Love that you can often see the Chef at his restaurants (Picasso and JS), always appreciate seeing that and think it's rare these days to have the actual Chef present! Go Chef!! 

In love love love with the octopus with risotto and basically all of the pasta dishes-yes, all!! I recommend going with a group so you can order everything!! I'm excited!! Portions are small and I feel are priced appropriately for the quality, taste, and presentation of the food, not to mention the gorgeous fountain view! Crab and Farro salad, so light, fresh and perfectly flavored. Being Asian I will call the crudo dishes sashimi :-)---salmon sashimi & scallop sashimi = Oyshi DOPE. Gnocchi with lobster knuckles, I mean... Wow. But my hands down fave that I will order over, and over, and over again was the squid ink pasta with lobster! Please see photo I posted. It was so wonderful!  Enjoyed the lamb and veal too, both so tender and magical to my taste buds! 

Finished this magical evening with a drink which I wish I could remember the name but it had a magical ball with magical juice and it literally exploded in your mouth... It's served in a martini glass with a scoop of sorbet that they pour prosecco over! Bravo!! 

Ok so I basically support Lago, a lot! Enjoy! :-)

P.s... Dear Bellagio-Lago-Chef, please open for lunch!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here with a 10:00pm reservation but with Saturday night traffic in Vegas. We arrived around 10:10pm. The hostesses were very nice and accommodating. We wanted a table on the patio and was told it would be a 20min wait, which my party didn't mind since it was a Saturday night. The 20min was up and we were seated at the center of the Patio which had an amazing view especially since the fountain show was running every 15min. The ambiance was modern and elegant with one of the best views of the city.

Our Waiter Arturo was very friendly and knowledgeable and explained to us the concept of the restaurant setting, which was Italian food served tapas style. Every dish we had was delicious but some of the stellar dishes we had was the 7x7 and Frute de Mare Risotto which were consistent and balance throughout. Zucchini Pizza was light, crispy and delicious. 

Overall we had a great time! Service and Food was on point and the ambience created a lasting impression on us. Great place to bring a group or family with great views of the fountains of Bellagio and Vegas."}
{"text":"All the dishes look simple and minimalistic .. but the taste.. so fresh , so simple yet so refreshing and tasty. All the dishes were so yummy and to top it with the majestic view.. is a la vegas experience .. try to come after dusk to live that view and food.. the drinks were good too .. and the cherry on the pudding was the chocolate dish we ordered. Out of the word .. I would come here again !!"}
{"text":"absolutely love this place.

Yummy martini's. The app's are SO small! The Carbanara is amazinggggggggggg. It has peas and pepper AHHH my mouth is watering just talking about it.
I love how you have the option of having a full or 1/2 portion of the pastas. 
Other favorites are the spaghetti & meatballs, lobster gnoocchi (SO rich i could only sample it), and the seasoned chips are yummy to munch on.

One of my favs"}
{"text":"Such an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain where we were seated. We ordered the Caesar salad, 1 lb bone-in Ribeye, Spaghetti Fruti de Mare (seafood spaghetti) I forget the spelling... Least favorite, and the tiramisu. The Caesar Salad was super good, the dressing was light yet flavorful. The Ribeye was very tender, juicy, and came with a whole roasted garlic on the side. It was extremely delicious with the Ribeye. Good service, good view, and good food!"}
{"text":"My family and I went this past Sunday (we were in town for the MayPac fight) and this was the highlight of our trip!!!  

I have been a big fan of JS for a long time and have gone to Picasso & JS in Aria every time I am in Las Vegas (about 4-5 times a year) and was very excited to hear that Lago was opening up in the old Circo space (that was a terrible restaurant).  

The restaurant is overlooking the famous fountains and if you had seen Circo before, you wouldn't recognize one thing about the space.  It was a complete gut renovation and looks awesome.  Very 50's Mod/Space age vibe with lots of gleaming white, chrome and marble.  Very cool concepts with the type of food they are serving.

We ordered a ton of food as we like to try everything the first time we go somewhere and there were some definite stand-outs.  Like JS Aria, the menu is small plates concept and they split the menu between breads (mini pizza, crostini, flat breads), crudo, veg, meat, pasta and seafood and then large share plates.

We started off with the crostini and focaccia breads and we could have ordered multiples of each.  The stand out this section was definitely the crostini with the olives and pecorino and the nduja focaccia.  The bread itself was perfectly cooked and salted.

For our 2nd course, we had the crudo of scallop and salmon.  Both were great, but the Scallop was really delicious.  Raw scallop isn't for everyone, but the texture and citrus flavors of this dish were really wonderful.

3rd course; Pasta & Risotto!!!  The highlights were definitely the red wine risotto and the 7&7 Gnocchi with lobster reduction.  Flavors, textures and ingredients were on point.

For our meat (protein) course, we had the Vongole clams, branzino and lamb chops.  The flavors were classic on all of these and not too innovative, but regardless the dishes were all exceptional especially the chops.  Usually when you get lamb chops as a small plate, they are tiny and very thin.  These were very thick and juicy with great moisture and flavor.

For dessert; we had the mini cannoli's were great and a perfect way to finish off the meal as they weren't overly sweet and had just enough ricotta and citrus zest to make them almost a palate cleanser.  

A few things that could change; they put their drinks and dessert on a iPad, which is really annoying and not necessary.  Its cumbersome and not worth the hassle to click thru images and pages when you could review a menu much more easily.  iPads have been around for while now, and its not very cool either way to have to swipe and touch a screen that many other hands have touched....talk about passing germs before you eat food with your hands.

The restaurant is loud and crowded.  High ceilings and vast space make it very loud, so don't expect a romantic date night.  Also, the seating is odd.  They mixed all different shape tables and seating, which make the restaurant extremely tight to maneuver (the hostess couldn't figure out how to get us to our table and we had to loop around) and you are sitting very close to every table around you.  

In reading some of the other reviews, a big complaint is the pricing and portions.  Not sure why people complain about pricing, when thats reviewable prior to going and as for the portions, even for \"small\" plate standards; there were really healthy portion sizes.  The waiter will recommend 3-4 plates per person and we ordered that and it was perfect and extremely filling.  Without ordering too much alcohol, you can definitely eat there for $50-$75 a person.

A lot of the food is very classic with flavors that people will recognize from their favorite Italian dishes, but most of the food is very innovative with amazing ingredients and flavors. I highly recommend Lago and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You can tell why this chef deserves his Michelin star. The service was excellent and prompt. We had a show to get to and the entire meal took very little time yet we never felt rushed. The food was amazing. The duck melted in our mouths. The branzino was juicy and flaky while the skin was crispy. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Only came here for afternoon drinks but they were awesome! This place is pretty quiet in the afternoon so if you're looking for a rager this isn't the place to go. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful new place!  We had a party of 6 and had the waiter pick our menu!  Wow, hands down the gnocchi with blue cheese sauce was the best gnocchi I've ever had. The sushi was wonderful. The red wine risotto was interesting and the melted burratta was incredible. I had the panna cotta was wonderful as well. The citrus was just right!  Only thing i would say id improve is the cocktail menu. It needs a few more interesting cocktails.  All in all a wonderful meal. One of our party said it was the best meal he has had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Well after eating at Jullian Serranos at The Aria, I wasn't completely shocked at the portion sizes here, but had I not known this, i probably would not of been happy.

We had resort credit we had to use up from M life, and Lago really was visually appealing, so we wanted to compare the two.

We arrived around 1120 pm. They close at Midnight, and our server Ariaena was pushing to get us to order. She wasnt the most friendly or informative, so of the two, service was better at JS Tapas.

We ordered a variety of dishes. Brusch Pomodora ( Brusetta ) was good, and at 8$ it was the least costly thing ordered.

We also had Salsiccia pizza which is a very small size. It was both very dry( crust ) and way too greasy 17$

Speaking of small, the Calamaro Rioieno was 4 teeny tiny bite size pieces. 

The ceaser salad was a small head of romaine cut into 4 and sprinkled with cheese and dressing.

The steak was small but very tasty. It was the best thing we had. 

We had a few other items, one drink each, and the total was close to 200$ 
I wasn't shocked since I expected it after eating at his other place, but unless it was comped again, I wouldn't return. 

On another note - this was the night that The Bellagio's Rolex store (in the main lobby) got robbed by a guy wearing a pig mask ( and others in a cat & a panda mask too ). 

When they used sledge hammers to smash out the glass , people thought it was gun shots...

It caused SO much panic and chaos as people ran and some hid under tables. There were reports of a live shooter and we assumed it was a shooting at the Nightclub. It wasn't until much later we discovered what was going on. 

Cops everywhere, we got locked down in the casino, outside gridlocked traffic and cops with machine guns. It was a crazy night. Had we not gone to dine here we would of missed it all !!"}
{"text":"Didn't realize this was a Julian Serrano restaurant. I just dined at Julian Serrano Tapas @ aria last night! Compared to that, the dishes are def not as salty as Tapas @ aria. 

We ordered:
-tuna crudo (not evenly salted tasted a bit bland)
-margarita pizza (not bad)
-lamb fusilli (a little too al dente)
-risotto (really packed with seafood flavor. Not too much seafood)
-salmon (comes in 3. Solid dish)
-octopus (comes in 1 tentacle and black couscous. Yum!!) 
-scallops (good decent)
-7&7 (yummy lobster + creamy potato gnocchi. Liked this a lot!)

Overall great view of the bellagio lake and the pros Eiffel Tower. Our service was fine but not anything extraordinary. I'd come again!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great view make for a perfect brunch spot in Vegas. If you want the best views outside, be sure to make a reservation. No complaints about Lago!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary. I wouldn't say Lago is vintage Vegas, but this is the direction where food in this city is heading. Unlike the buffets and steakhouses, portions are shrinking, focusing instead on taste, texture, and presentation. The popular outdoor patio seating has a front row view of the Bellagio fountains. Dining is now no longer just a gustatory and olfactory experience, but a visual one as well. 

While there are plenty of bread and meat options, the majority of the menu is seafood-heavy. The capasanta (scallop) was a light, clean, and refreshing dish to start off the meal. The pairing with blood orange was nice, and I loved the pistachios for textural contrast. One of the most popular dishes is the 7 x 7. Seven pieces of toasted gnocchi paired with seven pieces of lobster knuckles. Topped off with some tomato bisque, this dish was my favorite. For meats, the agnello scottadito (grilled lamb chops) was perfectly seared and didn't have that overwhelming gamey taste. The one dish I had an issue with was the pesce intero (baked boneless whole fish). This dish, meant to be shared for two, had quite a few sharp bones left. The sea bass itself was mediocre; however, I did enjoy the accompanying roasted vegetables. 

The service was fantastic. The cocktails were on point as well - strong, but enjoyable. Patio seating is first-come, first-serve, but worth the wait in my opinion. Acknowledging the need for a more casual dining experience than full-service fine dining, Julian Serrano creates something wonderful for the modern crowd. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food and ambience of this restaurant! The decoration and the modernness of the restaurant is really beautiful! I loved the presentation of the food! The view from the terrace is quite amazing during the night, especially when the Bellagio Water Fountain is on! Quite a romantic view. 

Easy parking with the Bellagio vallet. 

Salmon was bomb! The steak melted in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town & was looking to go somewhere in Cleveland for my fiancé's birthday dinner. After asking around on where to dine, I decided to take him to Lago. Next to the service & atmosphere, the food was outstanding. HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Francese! What I also loved about my experience was that my fiancé received a free dessert for his birthday so it made his night extra special."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants - so I was pretty excited to bring my future mother-in-law there for her birthday. We arrived early for our reservation and had a drink at the bar. My Aunt ordered a CC on the rocks, and they did not carry CC - so she ordered Crown. Her rocks drink appeared as a one ounce pour for a steep $10...she wasn't impressed. I explained that this was a nice establishment and that's what those drinks went for...so we moved on. We sat for dinner at the fun table right by the fire, we loved that. Our server was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. We each ordered a meal and were anxiously awaiting the grand finale - The food arrived promptly and beautifully, we were so excited! There was a salt issue with MIL and Aunt's scallops- but it was immediately remedied, we and they were impressed. The experience was great and we'll return. One thing I absolutely love about this place is if you purchase a $100 gift card you get an additional $25 gift card - we bought 5 ($100) as Christmas gifts. This place is amazing and I am looking forward to it's winter menu. I would love to see this place host a couple plated dinners for a fixed price - this would allow us an opportunity to navigate the menu a little further. BTW - I ordered the baked cavatelli and it was TO DIE FOR! Solid Lago, great job! A little excessive in price but worth it in food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Julian Serrano restaurants. Decided to check this place out for brunch. I didn't realize the brunch prix fixe was only on the weekends, but they were nice enough to offer it to us. This is a much more casual dining experience compared to his other restaurants in Vegas. Ordered the pulpo, lasagna prix fixe. They were both good. Also noticed they had some pata negra, so I had to get some. Our server suggested an excellent wine pairing for the pata negra. Wish more places offered pata negra. They also have good cocktails here. My favorite was the smoky peach margarita.  Also if you get the patio you can see the water show as well, but it's pretty warm outside though."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a brunch indoors, with its trendy tables, or outside on the patio where we sat and had an excellent view of Bellagio's water fountain. The food was delicious and reasonably priced ($28 for a 3-course meal) or you can order à la carte. The drinks were delicious (and picture worthy if you are one of us who enjoy taking pictures before eating and drinking). The servers were attentive, very friendly and multi-lingual, attending for guests from all over the world. Monique (Brazil) and Ali (lebanon) provided us with a 5-star service such that we would go back to Lago."}
{"text":"Food was good, but for the money portions were tiny, and service was sub-par. For a high end Resturant I expect a lot more. Our table was in a high traffic area, and service was chaotic and unorganized"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening for dinner around 4:30.  It was my husband & 2 older teens.  We walked in and the place was not busy at all.  3 people sitting at the bar, 1 table outside was taken and 2 tables inside were taken.

The hostess asked if we had reservations, I replied no.
She proceeded to point to only 2 tables and said we could have one of those .  Right across from the tables were 3 empty booths.  I asked if we could have a booth.  She said no that they were reserved.  I said 'really, they are reserved?'  She replied, 'yes, in a half hour.'.   Now I have made multiple reservations in my life to many restaurants across the country and ones that are way more upscale then this.  Not once are you ever given the chance to reserve a specific table or booth, and here she is telling me 3 booths are booked.  Ok, I wasn't going to argue.  We took one of the tables she offered.  

The food was decent.  I had cavateli, but for $19 was not worth it.  My son had short ribs and that was the best out of all the meals.  My husband got the burger and he did not like it at all.  I tried it and it was not good.  Had a very odd flavor to it.  He ate it anyway w/o further complaint.  My daughter just got the meatballs which again were fine but nothing great.  Same for the calamari app.

The reason for the 2 stars? Well after we were there for about 2 hours, only 1 of those 3 booths were  ever sat.  So because we weren't worthy of a booth and the hostess lied, we would never come back.  Paying that kind of money for food and you are treated like that is not going to fly in my book. It was never busy, only 2 couples came the entire time we were there and actually a 4th booth opened up after a couple that was there left.  So you keep saving those booths for worthier people I guess, we won't be occupying them ever.

Here is another update since the management replied to my review.  First of all don't tell me about being responsible for what I \"insinuate \" on social media.  We are old enough to know exactly what caused our gastrointestinal disturbance.  Let me clarify.  The 4 people that sat at that table that live together had no diarrhea issues before we were there.  Because of our busy schedules, the ONLY thing that any of us had shared to eat in the days leading up to the issue, were two of us and it was your burger!  Of which in my original review also so happened to be the ONLY thing the two of us said had a strange taste!  And low and behold about 24 hours later we were both stricken!  So yes, we know.  So don't try to berate my review because not me, but your establishment made you look bad. And really? You said it would not have only been us but a restaurant wide problem?? There are so many variables that could have made our burger tainted but not others!  You should know this!  So you making that statement shows me you are not very good manager!  For example, an employee could have had clean hands making all the burgers that night, but perhaps he went to the bathroom and came back w/o washing their hands yet touched up the burger I was served.  Or perhaps an ingredient on my burger was contaminated by a sneeze or a number of other ways!  So who are you fooling by making a statement such as \"had an incident such as you are insinuating occurred, this would have been a restaurant wide event.\"  And the fact that you received no notification from any other guest means nothing!  Most people deal with it and never go back. And yes, I happen to write the review and that is NOT an \"odd\" way to deal with what happen to us.  You also mentioned you \"will not accept\" my insinuation of our results of eating at your establishment!? Well then I would say YOU are not very responsible and anyone reading your response to my review alone should have red flags raised.  Ps. I just looked this up, and wish I had before, but how many health violations did you have in the past couple years? And you questioned my review!?"}
{"text":"I love this Restaurant for two reasons.... I get to eat my favorite dish on their menu which is Polpo E Fragola Al Nero and at the same time enjoy the Bellagio water fountain show... :)"}
{"text":"Our food was amazing.  The service was meh.  It started by arriving on time for 7pm resv & had to wait 45 minutes for our table.  Our server (who's name escapes me) was so so & at times wasn't very attentive to our table.

Lastly there was a table next to us & a woman had a lap-dog/accessory dog in her lap.  When I'm spending car-payment type money on dinner...I'd really prefer they not allow pets.  (Service animals are obviously different.)

But again - the food was very good top to bottom.  Hopefully they work out the kinks or perhaps we came on a bad night."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start? The atomosphere here is incredible. There is an amazing view of the fountains from inside the restaurant. You can also sit outside on the patio if there are tables available. I came here to meet with friends that I haven't seen In a long time. Our server was excellent, he did a great job on helping us decide what to get. The mushroom risotto is AMAZING, same with the chicken liver plate. The best was the ricotta cheese and honey. Everything was amazing though. We also got the lobster ravioli and lamb ragu pasta. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is ok it's nothing special. Small plates for a big price.  The service is great. The staff was so cool and make sure you are good."}
{"text":"I was pretty unimpressed with Lago- not to say it was bad but I had higher expectations. Everything was just mediocre with the exception of our drinks. Tapas we had were: Ahi tuna (very bland, not fresh tasting), Octopus (chewy, pretty subpar), Beef carpaccio, Lobster gnocchi, and Wine Risotto (those were all fine but nothing to write home about- especially when factoring in the price). The service was just okay. I feel like servers at an \"upscale\" place like this should have a bit more initiative.

The ambiance is nice and the fountains are neat to watch, but I'd definitely choose some of the other fountain-view restaurants over this. The music inside was also a bit loud for my liking. Not compelled to return..... maybe for a cocktail from the bar but that's it."}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of small plates, all were well thought out and had complex flavors. It was delicious. The waiters were attentive and helpful. The ambiance is bright and trendy. I definitely recommend if this place if you enjoy Italian/Mediterranean flavors."}
{"text":"Want to see the Water show and enjoy a really good meal, this is the place.  The ambiance is 5, the food is a 3, and Service is a 5.  The lite bites/share plates are good, but not great and are very small. We had 4 dishes that were good, but lacked superstar quality that you expect at these prices. Example, tomatoes on the tomato and motzarella salad were not ripe and lacked any flavor. The pasta and lobster was bland. The place is beautiful and it's fun to watch the Water show from here. 
Lite dinner for two with wine will be $150.  Overall, a 3 on food and 4 for overall experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in its service compared to my dinner experience here from when it first opened. Let's say.. What service? I was hardly acknowledged by the host. Why? is it because I didn't have makeup on? Because I look underage? because I'm dining by myself? I gave them benefit of the doubt since bar seating is open seating. Fine. About 5 minutes later, another woman walked in, definitely more mature looking than I was. She was definitely greeted by the same host. That host walked her to the bar seat and actually pulled out the chair for her. I had to scramble to pull the chair far enough to climb up myself and be able to pull it in. Nice way to discriminate, Mr. host. Furthermore, I saw some guys who had printed t-shirts and still get treated better than me. And what's great about dining alone? I'm drafting the review as it happens. Any check ins from anyone? Nope. My water wasn't refilled, no one really checked on me for finishing although I'm sitting at the bar and there are 2 servers attending. Way to go, Lago!

I ordered the zuppa allo zenzero, a summer squash puree with spicy croutons. Not sure why I was expecting a cold soup, maybe I thought of summer and needing to stay cool. It's definitely a decent soup. It's dense in texture but not too heavy. If you're craving for a light lunch, that would be perfect.

Also ordered the fusilioro, since I was craving for pasta. I was not expecting my pasta to come out at the same time as my soup. Yes, thank you for warning me about hot plate and such. I doubt my pasta would still be dangerously hot by the time I'm done with my soup.  Yep, it cooled down a lot when I took my first bite. It was a bit cooler at the top, still warm in the center though. Yes, aside from the fantastic service, the food here is still worthy. That al dente texture to the point. It's not soft enough to fall apart like how my life is from the eyes of that host. Lamb ragu may be a bit too gamey for some folks, but those loving fragrant (very subjective) flavors, this is worthwhile even I had to deal with that rude attitude from earlier. 

So if you guys want to dine here with a decent experience, put some eyebrows on, ladies!"}
{"text":"So we made reservations at 10:15 but had to wait 20 extra minutes to be seated by the window for the most beautiful Las Vegas view.

Lago is a newest restaurant by Michelin Starred Chef Julian Serrano; located in the Bellagio, which is a new rendition of a contemporary Italian themed Cuisine which just opened in April, 2015.

THE STAFF -

While our servers were not on their best behaviors, the food picked up their charm.
The tables are so close that the waiter's  butt kept jabbing me to assist the table next to me and he never said sorry, it almost felt like he wanted his butt in my face! 


THE FOOD -

Pasta fagioli e cozze -  this soup with muscles which my dining companions couldn't stop raving about. It was delightful and had a bit of clean yet rustic flavor without being overwhelming with salt.

I had their Cesar salad, and I rarely compliment salad dishes, but the seasoned sardines blew me away, it was really magnificent.  The texture of the vegetables and croutons was one of the, if not the best mixture I've experienced from a salad dish.

Risotto di fruti di mare - My second course was the Risotto, which was probably the best risotto dishes I've had in Las Vegas, with elegant and aromatic flavor and impeccable texture of the farro. I hadn't distinguished what trick the kitchen pulled off, but the king oyster and maitake mushroom tasted almost like a flawless grilled meat, with smoked macadamia and crispy leeks to support the mushrooms. 

Pesce fish - orata which was perfectly cooked but the reserved yet elegant flavor of curry broth added another dimension to this dish and the flavor was modest without being salty.

I would definitely recommend coming here again.  It's my top 5."}
{"text":"Great food, service and wonderful view of the fountain. Would definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had a bit of a rough start here.. we made reservations online for 11pm (after a show) and as we got there, the hostess told us they were closed. We showed her that we made a reservation, and their hours online indicate they are open until midnight so we were very annoyed.

We decided to go back the next morning for brunch. We got there as soon as it opened and they told us they were full. The manager came over and apologized, got us a very nice seat near the window and our first round of drinks (amazing) 

The Sunday brunch was delicious!!! I had the antipasto and my husband had a special of scallops and bacon which were amazing! We both had the steak and eggs and loved it.

View of the fountain was beautiful and our server was fabulous!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Try the calamari and the meatballs for starters. The veal ravioli with prosciutto was to die for. Cant complain about the prices as I went for a business meeting, but its definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"Two of us came here for dinner last evening.  A front patio table had been reserved for us.  

Our server was Carlos and we was absolutely top notch--the best!

The two of us shared all of then plates.  We started with the chicken liver and capers toasted bread.  Very good.  Next, we had the risotto with tripe and mushrooms.  This was better than the last time I had the dish when I was here for a Yelp event.  There was more spiciness to the dish.

Next we had the octopus with black squid ink cous cous.  Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  This was followed by our favorite of the night, the quail saltimbocca--boneless quail wrapped with prosciutto.  It was excellent.  Four nice sized pieces of quail with the prosciutto.  A perfect dish for sharing.

Then we had the branzino that was on top of capers, olive slices, and tomatoes.  The last tapas dish we shared was the 7 and 7, potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles.  The gnocchi and the lobster were very good.  Not yet quite full, we ordered the osso buco served on a bed of creamy cheese polenta.  The osso buco was flavorful and had a fair amount of meat.  The cheese flavor of the polenta was absent.

Not quite done, we ordered two desserts--one that my dining companion had heard was very good and one Carlos recommended.  My companion wanted the giandujotto, hazelnut ice cream with another piece of hazelnut cream encased in a chocolate coating.  Carlos recommended the panna cotta with mango sorbet and sliced fruit.  Both were good but the panna cotta was the best.  It was light and exactly the kind of dessert to have after the meal we had eaten.  It was light, flavorful, and citrusy.

Service throughout our two and a half hours there was the best you could want.  Carlos was extremely knowledgable about the dishes and when asked, he was pleased to recommend things.  Our water glasses never got below being half empty--yes, I'm a half empty kind of person--and Carlos brought a fresh glass of iced tea to me before I was finished with the current one.

With the beautiful patio and the view of the fountains and Paris Las Vegas, it was a memorable evening.  I'm plotting when I can return and try some of the things I saw on the menu that will draw me back."}
{"text":"Expect to pay anywhere from $100 to $140 per person. If those prices scare you, don't cry when they present the bill. I enjoy their food. What really stands out is that they do seafood very well. Also, every time I have gone the staff is very upbeat and they all seem excited to work there. My wife is a fan of red win risotto. I get squid and different fish stuff. Every time I've had a few different things, but everything was always superb. I was a fan of Circo, but I think this place has a better feel for 2015."}
{"text":"Julian Serrano's latest may be his best. Unpretentious, modern feel. The food is amazing and you can sample nearly all of it with a party of 6 or more. Red wine risotto was outstanding. Tapas or \"little plates\" are not so little. Service was attentive and not over the top. Wonderful view of the fountains, excellent cocktails. Given it's relative infancy they are off to an impressive start."}
{"text":"Lago is fantastic. Call before you arrive at your hotel to make a reservation so there is not an issue, it does get crowded and sold out. It is located at the Bellagio, a beautiful hotel. The location is perfect. If you want to sit near a view of the Bellagio fountains ask, speak up. 
Please do not go dressed in shorts looking like you are on line at a cheap buffet. Dress for the occasion, wear a nice pair of pants and anything other than flip flops. This is an expensive place to eat, it is beautiful, the food is great, so treat it as such.
Everything on the menu is wonderful. Try a steak and a fish dish. They have a pizza oven and I am sure it is great, but I did not have pizza, so I don't know.
The service is wonderful, you are well taken care of and they make you feel special. If you are there for a special occasion let then know before you are seated. 
I would not take kids here. You can, but they are going to get bored, you will be there awhile. 
They have wonderful desert items. If you can afford it have a bottle of wine, but I don't think their list is the best and it is very pricey. I rather spend my money on the food, oh the food. But you do what you want. They have a full bar with great drinks.
You will be there for an hour or more. It is not that they are slow at all, the food is perfect and you simply are not rushed. If you are in a hurry, go elsewhere.
Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, had a short wait for a table, we were seated right on the window with a great view of the fountains of Bellagio.   

Our server Ricardo did a nice job during our meal.   

We ordered the panini veggie $15.00 (not enjoyed, would not order again), a Caprese salad $16.00 (delicious, way too small portion for price) and a side of grilled fingerlings $5 (delicious).  No cocktails/wine, or other beverages."}
{"text":"First time here. Not disappointed. First the bad part. It's a bit expensive. However, the food if very good! We started with a shared appetizer, the calamari. Not fried as it is in most places, but in a tomato based sauce that was outstanding. The calamari was tender but the sauce! We soaked up every last drop with the bread so we didn't waste any. Then, I had the lasagna. Also with a tomato based sauce that had a hint of the same flavor of the calamari sauce. I took home half of the lasagna and enjoyed it again the next evening. My wife had the Baked Cavatelli. She loved it and also took home half for the next day. I tried hers too, lots of delicious mushrooms and a creamy goat cheese based sauce. We saved room for dessert by saving leftovers. My wife tried the Seasonal Bread Pudding. Different than she's used to but she said it was delicious too. I had the Pistachio Mousse. Crushed pistachios on top and LOTS of mousse. Also delicious. I hope I've done the food justice here with my descriptions. It was a very enjoyable meal. Well worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Service is really slow here. Our server said hi and didn't come back to take our order for another 20 minutes. The food is alright but not orgasmic. I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what you're getting. Everything is tapas style so you're meant to share and all the plates are really small. Nice view of the bellagio fountains though!

Our server didn't even come back once he took our order. Terrible service tbh."}
{"text":"OK, so to premise this off I'm not the greatest fan of tapas, or 'little plates' because well...I'm a big dude!  I love big portions!  So if you're gonna come to Lago on an empty stomach you will be sorely disappointed.  Just keep in mind most of the plates there are consistent with 2-3 bites!  It is highly suggested you dine family-style here with a good marker of at least two plates per person.  Olympic eaters beware!

Yep, I'm a Yelp Elite, and yep, I did come back with our gracious gift certificate that we obtained at a recent event held at Lago.  But, I would have probably visited without the comp anyway.  So call my review biased if you like, but I'm going strictly off of the food we ordered, and the service we received.

Because it was a Mother's Day weekend, and it was coincidentally also near my kid's 13th birthday (boy they grow up fast) I decided to make a reservation for a Sunday late afternoon dinner.  To my delight there was an opening for three, any later in the day and we probably would have been turned away.  Upon arriving at Lago, our hostess told me that the manager booked us for patio seating, right in front of the fountains of the Bellagio.  Beautiful!  We even had the 'Reserved' placard on our table - fancy, fancy.  Great start.

Our server was Christina, and wow was she super hospitable.  Of course she probably already knew we were coming, but I watched her interact with the surrounding tables and she was just as friendly and outgoing with them as she was with us.  For our entire dinner she was attentive and very patient with us, explaining every dish we asked her about.  Much thanks Christina!

After wishing the wifey Happy Mother's Day and the kid Happy Birthday, Christina helped us order some choice goodies:

*Margherita Pizzette - with tomato sauce, house mozzarella & basil
*Al Cipollotto e Speck Pizzette - buffalo ricotta, cipolline onion & speck (cured ham)
*7 & 7 - potato gnocchi, lobster knuckles, & salsa di crostacei
*Ravioli al Gamberi - shrimp/mascarpone stuffed ravioli & fresh tomato
*Filettino - 4 oz. Angus beef tenderloin & gorgonzola
*Osso Buco - red-wine braised veal shank & polenta al formaggio

With Lago, they aren't kidding with the 'little plates'!  Even my kid was like, \"Is this all our food?\"  Spoken like a true champ.  But I told her to give it a try, sometimes food should taste very good but not make you overly full.  We all ended up liking everything!  Surprisingly, the ravioli ended up being the least favorite dish on our table (and my kid loves ravioli).  It tasted great but the stuffing on the inside was light.  

The pizzettes were tasty but I of course wish they were a big larger.  Wifey & kid liked the Margherita, I favored the one with speck.  That buffalo ricotta was creamy!  Faves for the kid was the 7 & 7 and the Filettino.  She loves her rare beef!  It was funny because the three of us had to share a 4 oz. portion.  Cutting that beef into small slices was just too much.  Luckily wifey let us partake in the beef while she paid attention to the Osso Buco.  That was the star of the night!  So unctuous, tender, beefy, delicious!  This was a main course, but I wish it came in a bigger dish!  I would have gotten two orders of this.  The polenta that accompanied this was divine, with all the cheese & butter mixed in, it was silky smooth.  Decadent.

You probably surmised by now that we finished every last bite!  So much so we didn't have any room for dessert, and we probably should have saved some because Lago had some pretty looking ones.  Next time!

Overall we had a wonderful experience at Lago.  Food was excellent, and our service was excellent as well.  We enjoyed out time dining there, never at any moment did we feel rushed or unattended.  Yes, I wish many of their dishes were more main course sized but if you keep an open mind you will have a good time here.  We did, and I would not hesitate coming again for a nice meal.  Much thanks to Julian Serrano and his staff for giving us a night to remember. 

Is it Spanish?  Is it Italian?  No silly...it's LAGO!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars!

We chose Lago for our 5 year anniversary.  We had requested the patio, but in a freaky twist it was 55 degrees and windy mid May in Vegas so the patio was closed.  We had a lovely table by the window instead.  We did pop out on the patio for one of the water shows.  It is so lovely to view the fountains and strip through the window but the show does lose a bit of it's luster without the music.  So, choose the patio if you can, it's truly spectacular.  

Inside is bustling.  The restaurant was busy and loud.  It is very modern and upbeat inside.  There is loads of cool décor, swanky light fixtures, bright colors and beautiful people.   It is definitely a different ambiance than other restaurants lakeside.  It is more casual if you want a nice meal without the full fine dining experience.  

The staff was on point from start to finish.  The hostesses were friendly and talkative.  Everyone wished us a happy anniversary.  Our service was nothing short of spectacular.  Plates were cleared immediately, but not without asking.  This is especially nice when you feel the urge to lick the bottom of all of them!  Water was constantly filled, clean plates and utensils were brought whenever needed, help with the menu was offered etc.  I was really impressed with our service.  We wanted for nothing, yet they were not invasive.  

We ordered the crab and farro salad, raw scallops with blood orange, salumi platter, eggplant caponata, meatballs, lobster gnocchi, and red wine risotto.  Everything was delicious.  Absolutely zero complaints on the food.  Many of the dishes were pleasantly surprising as the menu leaves most to the imagination.  For example, the eggplant caponata turned out to be a dish of chilled pickled vegetables with fresh herbs and raisins.  It was quite possible one of our favorite items but not at all what we expected.  I envisioned hot roasted eggplant.  The vegetables were cool and crisp and super flavorful.  The crab and faro salad was equally as flavorful, yet very light and refreshing.  It was coated in just the right amount of olive oil for a pleasant richness.  The raw scallops were like butter in your mouth but juxtaposed with limoncello and blood orange for a burst of citrus fun.  Again, we were impressed with everything we ordered and had zero complaints.  The meatballs were certainly the most heart dish.  Three large meatballs with scrumptious red sauce.  A good filler to balance out much of our lighter fare.  The sauce was yummy and I would have adored a piece of bread to sop the rest up.  

Hubby has a nice glass of red wine.  I ordered a virgin passion fruit mojito.  It was so nice to have exciting choices of beverage for a pregnant lady.  Many of their cocktails had specialty syrups and sodas so it was easy to have a fun drink without losing all the pizazz.  My mock mojito had passion fruit soda, vanilla bean syrup, lime and mint.  It was literally gorgeous topped with a pineapple cone dusted in gold fairy dust and filled with sweet ginger.   It was overly limey at first but my server gladly added some syrup and redelivered it in a snap!  

Alas, we were too full for dessert.  8 tapas for 2 was perfect and filled us right up.  

There were main courses available if a guest prefers to avoid tapas.  The prices were surprisingly not bad on those.  For example, $50 for a 1 lb. rib eye with potatoes and asparagus or $28 for roasted chicken.  

The strip is tricky because you are paying for location, location, location.  So, our lovely dinner cost us $200 for 2 with one glass of wine, and one mocktail.  The view was incredible, the food was delicious and the service was outstanding so I would recommend Lago to anyone for a very nice dinner."}
{"text":"Someone suggested Lago to us at a card table, and I'm so glad we listened to them. My fiancé loved everything about it, especially the view! We went for lunch, and we're very surprised at the decent prices! We paid less for lunch here than we paid for breakfast in the Bellagio. I had the ricotta and spinach stuffed chicken breast, and trust me, I ate every bite. I would go to Vegas just to have this meal again! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with a reservation for 5:45 pm (which I made the same morning) I was eager to sit on the patio however keep in mind it is VERY difficult to reserve a patio seat unless you talk to right people in the casino management (or you can try your luck but may have to wait)  ounce I arrived to the hostess I gave her my reservation and she escorted us outside to the patio but not before recommending dining slots are 1:45 minutes on the patio I explained to her I intend to have quite a bit of food and drinks and knowing how hard it is to reserve the patio in the first place (and knowing I had second reservations at giadas at about 10pm and no where to go in between) I politely told her I'll take her recommendation into consideration but JUST as a recommendation the restaurant which is located in the Bellagio hotel is quite big and has a great view of the \"famous\" Bellagio fountains it has a beautiful decor which mostly consists of blue, white and silver accents it also has nice art work on the walls HOWEVER! Everything changes ounce on the patio this big 200+ seat restaurant transforms into this very small and intimate European feeling space with maybe 6 six tables your surrounded by water so close to the fountains you can feel the mist on your face and with the Eiffel Tower (across the street) and the rest of the Las Vegas strip as your back drop this patio is simply breathtaking..... taking all of this in while enjoying beautiful food and possibly too much of your favorite beverage this is by far the best way to watch and appreciate the Bellagio fountains 

As for the food between the two of us we ordered four dishes plus dessert we started with margherita pizzette which was definitely above average it was super thin and they make the mozzarella in house we also started with the burrata cheese which had a nice texture this dish was good but definitely not memorable after that we decided to try a pasta dish so we opted for the paccheri the red sauce in this dish was amazing however the over all dish again was good but not memorable after some more drinks we decided to get one more so we opted for the chicken livers it's served on crostini the dish had good flavor but was very spicy after few more drinks we decided that was enough savory so we decided to go with dessert we ordered the orange zest cannoli which was amazing the cannoli shell was really light and crisp next time I would start with this as a pre appetizer

Over all we were here five hours (I would have loved to stay longer but had to leave to make our second dinner reservations) I had to give it five stars due to the view and ambience the food it's self was good and better than a lot of Italian restaurants and maybe we ordered the wrong things but I did expect to be more wowed considering the chef is Juilian Serrano and keep in mind we did dine at two Italian restaurants this evening so I am comparing the two the other one being giadas (Which I will also write a review review) out of the two I believe Giadas has the better food (dessert excluded) however everything considered in my opinion Lago is BY FAR the superior restaurants because what it may lack in food compared to giadas it greatly makes up for in view and ambience (if on the patio) but again the food was good just not as good all in all it was an amazing experience"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here on April 20th to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary. I was lucky enough to get to attend the Gold Elite event held at Lago the previous week, so I knew I was in for a great meal in a beautiful setting. My expectations were met and then some. 

We arrived promptly for our 6 pm reservation and we were lead by the personable hostess to our reserved table on the patio, overlooking the famous Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower across the street at Paris. The manager came over to thank us for celebrating our anniversary with them, and then our server, Carlos, proceeded to explain the menu to us. 

Lago is Italian themed tapas, so many of the menu items are intended to be shared, and very few of the items could be considered a meal on their own. Carlos explained that items are brought out as soon as they are prepared, and recommended we start with a couple dishes and then order more as the night went on. 

Service was impeccable. While Carlos was our main server, we interacted with various other employees as food was brought out to us and dishes were removed from the table. Everyone was fantastic. 

My husband and I started out by sharing a few items and then decided to move on to 2 of the larger entrees. The insalata sarda was a wonderfully light dish to start off with, and I loved the way the brown sugar and balsamic brought out the flavor of the ricotta infornata. After sampling a couple more items we moved on to our entrees, my husband had the polletto and I had the filetto. My steak was such a deliciously tender cut of meat and gorgonzola with red wine reduction topping was to die for. 

We could not resists sharing a dessert after our entrees, we went with the panna cota which was a wonderful combination of vanilla and citrus. Our server Carlos said it was a favorite of his, and that was a wonderful recommendation on his part. 

Lago was an excellent venue for us to celebrate our marriage, and a lovely addition to the Bellagio property."}
{"text":"I am very honored to write this review about Julian Serrano's master piece: Lago.

The waiter recommended each person order between 2-3 dishes and share amongst each other, encouraging a tapas haven.

Food came quickly and the feast had begun. Every dish was superb, as copious amount of dopamine imploded each time I took a bite.

Here's what to order for sure:

1. Grilled octopus (deliciously tender)
2. Branzino (flavorful crispy skin with tender succulent meat)
3. Scallops (unreal)
4. Baby shrimps in white wine spicy sauc
5. Seafood Risotto
6. Tripe Risotto
7. Crab Salad
8. Caprese
9. Every desert was spectacular"}
{"text":"The most unbelievable service and best view of Lake Bellagio. Out server Elmer and the rest of the staff were amazing.  I'll be sending everyone to Lago. Oh the food... Julian Serrano has gone way above and beyond. The most amazing food I've ever eaten. Bummed we missed desert to get to the \"O\" show on t8me."}
{"text":"Everyone who comes to Vegas needs to come and eat her at least once! It is such an amazing place and the views oh the views! After 6pm the water shows are on every 15 minutes. The setting is very romantic and super modern also. The servers are all really great and great with customer service. The food was amazing and well worth every single penny! Do keep in mind that the portions are rather small, so I suggest you order several dishes and you won't be disappointed! Also another thing to keep in mind is to get a reservation at this place because it does fill up quickly, especially in the evenings on the weekends. We had the pleasure of our hotel staff booking our reservations for us and we are so glad that they did other wise we wouldn't have known about such a wonderful place. I will defiantly be coming back here again everything was unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. They took care of our large party of 13 with ease. Special shout out to Christine.  View on the Bellagio fountains was totally cool.  Food was excellent. We ordered most of the tapas plates on right side of the menu. Octopus served with squid ink cous cous was the best. Although my buddy liked lamb chops so much he ordered one more instead of dessert."}
{"text":"Tonight I came for a dinner with co-workers before we all headed back to our perspective hometowns. I must say everything was a pleasant surprise!! We were cold, they happily moved us. We weren't sure what to drink, Jae brought several suggestions and made us very delicious craft cocktails. I was going to get a pizza, was soooo glad I took the suggestion of the Lobster gnocchi! (Really the highlight amongst some very tasty starters!!) At every turn Jae was able to meet and exceed our needs. If I ever come back to Cleveland, I will most definitely come back here for dinner. Thank you for a great evening!!!"}
{"text":"I've attended the Gold Elite Event, as well as several other times for client lunches. 

The dining space is open, bright, modern, fun, but yet welcoming. I think there are ideas that I would take into my own home one day. For example, the chrome shelving at the bar with the white background pops! 
If it is a nice day, it is nice to sit on the Patio, but it's also nice to be casual and sit at the bar. No bad options here. 

For the food - I really like the tapas idea since I'm always one to share and try many dishes during a meal. 
Some of my favorites: 
-Caesar Salad with mini hearts of Romaine
-Caprese, simple but flavorful
-Braised pulled duck meat with polenta - Like butter! 
-Italian Fries - Yas! 

Lago started to serve Brunch and I need to check it out soon!!"}
{"text":"Located in the Bellagio, Lago is a beautiful Italian restaurant. The food was fantastic but I'll get to that. The Greatest thing about the restaurant was the views from the outside patio area. We came at night and requested to sit outside, which the very graciously accommodated. Although the scorching hot out, it was worth it. We got the best view of the Bellagio fountain show, all while enjoying some drinks and a wonderful meal.

The ambiance was spectacular. My only qualm was although the service was good I didn't feel like our server was very engaging and didn't seem to be happy to be there at all. But hey everyone has a bad day at work sometimes, so I guess no big deal. 

The food was excellent. To be honest this is Vegas so we were a little drunk by the time we even got to the restaurant. So my memory is hazy on the exact dishes. Lol. But I know I had a sea food risotto that was fantastic. Everything else we tried was really good. And the drinks were great too. Will positively come back when in Vegas again"}
{"text":"A mini girls trip (5) to Cleveland from Columbus found us at Lago on Saturday night. It was wonderful from the moment we set foot inside. I wish I knew the name of our waitress because she was amazing as was our food and drinks. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was okay.  It's surprisingly loud and the food wasn't very memorable.  I left with a bill of $386 which included a yellow label Veuve with out dinner and a tip.  Upon entering the restaurant, although I made a patio request which is a request, not gauranteed, it wasn't ready. We waited at the bar for about 30-40 minutes until our table was ready.  The restaurant may be intimidating on the inside due to the noise level and people coming in and out, but on the patio it included a beautiful watershow with a great view.  To be quite honest, if we didn't get patio seating I would have left and found somewhere else to eat. I believe there's a confusion when I ask for \"fine dining\" and I'm told by the hostess that it's considered fine dining with the noise level.  For a special occasion I prefer quieter more romantic settings where this is more for social dinners.  None of the dishes were memorable but I do remember ordering beef and my SO made a comment after trying it first, \"Have you ever had a sausage mcmuffin from McDonalds?\" I take a bite of it and I go, \"Oh...\" Lol.  This restaurant has so much potential if the food had more flavor! I've had better Italian sadly for half the price."}
{"text":"Great food and wine. Service was initially a disaster but they recovered so well. Interestingly the staff from Circo is still about 90% there. The Margharita pizza, 7&7 and veal were all exceptional. Wine prices are high, but consider the location. We got a nice Orrin Swift Prisoner for twice retail. This would be a five star review except for the mess at the front with the seating women and the early problems with Service. I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome view of fountains- delicious tapas  style menu options.- starting at $15.  Waitress recommended the ham as a starter  - based on the plate prices we assume would be the same.  Imagine our surprise when the bill came- $40 for ham and cheese app!  While it was delicious- we would NEVER have ordered a $40 appetizer---and at lunch!  We felt that was sneaky.  Again the food was great but we felt we had been taken advantage for not specifying the cost of such as expensive starter!  That should have been specified!  If it was seafood we would have inquired market price---but who knew ham!!!  The server was very nice but a bit pushy- we ordered 4 plates- and she 2 times offered \"chef recommends 3 each\".   Appreciate the recommendation but shouldn't the customer know their food intake limits?"}
{"text":"My girlfriends & I like this place for brunch. Lago has a beautiful patio right on the Bellagio fountain with a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower. Their service is wonderful, friendly and very accommodating. I adore their bartenders. They have a great brunch with wonderful bottomless beverages. I honestly haven't been impressed with the food though, we more go because we love champagne with a view."}
{"text":"We had 6:15 reservations as a belated birthday dinner for my boyfriend and it was absolutely delightful from the time we sat down to when we got up and left. 
We arrived a few minutes late, however that was no problem for them and sat us right away. They even asked if we wanted a patio seat, which I forgot to ask for one in our reservations, but was I so glad they still had some available because the view was beautiful!
Now, my boyfriend and I aren't exactly \"foodies\" so we don't judge everything based on every little detail. Good food is good food to us, but we love tapas because it gives us the chance to try plenty of different dishes without spending tons of money. And let me tell you, each dish we had was loaded with flavor and all cooked so perfect, even their cocktails were yummy! We had a total of 7 tapas between us two, and that was just the right amount for the both of us. They even brought out a complimentary dessert for my boyfriend and if I wasn't stuffed, I would've had waaay more spoonfuls!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal here in this new restaurant for the Bellagio.

The concept is Italian but with a but of a tapas style in that you order a selection of dishes to all share. They suggested that we should order two or three dishes per person which would have been far too much for us (we are British rather than rom the U.S. :)) and eight dishes between five of us was plenty.

Food was excellent though and service great.  Would definitely return to this one!"}
{"text":"I loved Lago's ambiance, view and location. The restaurant is facing Bellagio's fountains. We were having dinner so the view was spectacular with Vegas' lights and the water show. 

The food was really good. 

Here is the food we order and their ranking:

Burrata (5/5) - bomb, must get as starter
Bruschetta (4.5/5) - really good 
Gnocchi (4.5/5) - really good. It seems like 6 pieces won't get you stuffed- they do!
Risotto (4.5/5) - so good, recommend it- very filling
Linguine al pesto (1/5) - I love pesto and pasta but this dish literally had no flavor. I don't recommend this dish. 

Overall, gorgeous view and good food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"On a recent culinary meetup with our party of 16, Lago was plenty accommodating. Upon our arrival, there was a private room setup with four large tables arranged in a fashion to comfortably seat our large group. The setting was in order for the memorable meal that followed. 

A three course prix fixe menu was offered as a value to those who didn't wish to order from the full menu. Our server, admittedly new to Lago, was plenty attentive and patient with our group. 

To start, my accomplice and I shared a bowl of steamed mussels and clams in a white wine garlic broth. The clams, I am unhappy to report, tasted gritty from sand left unrinsed. The broth, nothing I couldn't have constructed at home. 

Next, I had the grilled lamb chops with pumpkin gratin, brussels sprouts and pomegranate vinaigrette. Now, I've ordered lamp chops at other fine dining establishments and have only received a small chop or two of this delicate meat as an entire entrée (I'm talking to you Johnny's Downtown). At Lago, I was served an entire rack of lamb with about 8 ribs each! Cooked to my choice of medium rare, they knocked this dish out of the park and certainly made up for the first course. Damn this was good! 

Throughout the meal, my other gracious friends let me sample their lobster gnocchi and separately, the veal tortelloni. The flavors of each were intense and left me wanting to come back in the very near future to sample the rest of the menu. 

For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu which is standard for me. My partner, the goat cheese crème brûlée which was absolutely phenomenal. My only complaint was that I would've ordered an entire portion of that instead of my tiramisu which by the way was also very good. 

Overall, the entire dining experience seemed to go off without a hitch. It was nice in getting to experience good food with the company we were joined by. See you soon Lago. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This champagne brunch place inside of the Bellagio gets 3 stars for the looks. We made reservations here for my moms 50th birthday brunch while staying at the hotel and although the atmosphere and ambience is great, the food was okay. There were about 10 of us so we were able to try almost everything on the buffet style menu, & nothing really wow'd me. It was about $50 a person for one appetizer, one entree and dessert. There weren't that many options and everything is egg based (including the lasagna), so if you hate any kind of eggs on your food that's not breakfast...don't come here. The portions are also pretty small, so not for sharing. The service was not that great, but I liked that the waiters all looked neat & clean. Overall I had a mediocre experience...if you're staying here I'd at least consider checking it out"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday on our first trip to Las Vegas and I don't think we could have chosen better for what we wanted: a combination of good food, a cool ambience, and something classically Las Vegas. Service was great from start to finish. I insisted on holding out for a patio table even though it meant a long wait past our reservation time. We had drinks at the bar meanwhile, which were excellent. When we finally got a table, we had a perfect time watching the fountains. We ordered 6 small plates for 2 people and were stuffed by the end. Standouts for me were the 7&7 (gnocchi with lobster) and the brasato d'anatra (braised duck). For dessert, we mentioned my birthday and were brought a tasty and beautiful dessert for free. I also ordered an espresso, which the waiter went way out of his way to make for me - Lago's machine broke, so he went to an adjoining restaurant to make one and didn't charge us for it. On the way out, every single staff member we saw stopped to thank us for coming in. I'm sure this isn't the best restaurant in Las Vegas, but for our purposes it was the perfect mix that made for a fantastic night. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Sauntered my way in after a couple of drinks at WXYZ next door.  It was a late Saturday night and I have to say, I really enjoyed the ambience.  The DJ was spinning some Rihanna, it wasn't too crowded, the vibe was cool and hip but not intimidating at all.  Most importantly, they were still serving food at 11:30 PM!! My friends and I got a bunch of different items from their late night menu.  The standouts for me were the Burger ($7) and the Mussels ($8).  The broth was probably the best I've ever had...practically lured me into slurping it straight out of the bowl.  Service was attentive and the wine list was pretty impressive with affordable prices.  I would love to come back and have a proper dinner here based on my experience."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The setting was amazing (sitting on the rail overlooking the Bellagio fountain). But the service was pretty bad (with the exception of a great bartender). Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, we waiting for a long time in the bar and were forgotten until we went back to find out what was up, once seated the server forgot several things that we ordered, as well as a few other issues.  For the price, in Vegas, at a spot like Bellagio, I would expect much better service."}
{"text":"Karlyn was great!!!! Always checking on how the food was and if we needed anything else. Very attentive and personal. Made the meal like it was eating with family.  GORGEOUS AND FOOD WAS AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and had a chance to stay at Aloft. I was going to try some other places but it's pouring rain so I gave this a try. 

The bar area was nice and it's perfect for single traveler to diner. I had to sit at the end of the bar (partially blocked by the bottles) because one of the bartenders were sitting like right in the middle of the bar (I think she's off from the shift but lingering as she's getting some food to go) and she's spreading out too - so even though there were empty seat on both of her sides - it was not a welcoming spot. *sad*

But the bartender who was on duty was awesome. She spotted me even though there were plenty of people having drinks after work and she took great care of me :) Food wise, I had their simple salad and a calamari. The simple salad looked great on the menu but it's bland. The bib lettuce were torn into these really awkward large pieces; the \"shaved\" onions weren't really \"shaved\" (more like really bad thinly sliced red onions);  and the orange segments tasted like canned tangerines to me. I just don't think they put much thought into prepping such a simple salad. The vinaigrette was nice but the whole thing lack flavor.  I know - it's only $8. But I feel like I could do better.

However, the calamari was a stunning dish. The calamari was cooked into perfection - tender and flavorful. The tomato broth has a tiny little bit of kick and it's super flavorful. I was on a no-carb diet but I totally broke the rule and asked for bread to soak up all the yummy goodness. Since the calamari was served in a bowl, I worried if they would get overcooked as pieces were sitting in the broth...but that did not happen at all. From the first bite to the last bite, it's perfection all the time. 

And the bread - they served it warm - so totally worth to break the rule and enjoy some real good carb. 

I don't know if I'll be a fans of this place.  It's suck that they put so much care in making this awesome calamari and warm yummy bread and no care in making a simple salad. So overall, it's an OK place for me. I'm sure - if I'm back to Cleveland, I'll definitely stop by and have that real darn good calamari!!"}
{"text":"The worst Italian restaurant ever. First things first the decor was uninviting and the chairs were uncomfortable. 
A friend and I each ordered a appetizer and an entree. I ordered the yellow squash soup for $11 and the gnocchi for $17. The soup was enjoyable that is what the one star is for. The gnocchi was absolutely horrible. It consisted of 6 perfectly symmetrical pieces and bland flavor. I'm sure it came frozen I've never had gnocchi so bad. 
 My friend had the duck which came out looking like shredded beef and he said tasted like an Irish pot roast. He also had the chicken liver which we both thought may have been cat food instead. 
You pay full meal prices for appetizer sizes.
I never in good Faith recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday night for a birthday dinner!  So great!  The food was awesome - Veal Picatta so good - the Red Wine Risotto was simply amazing!  The service was great - we had a large party, but we were served quickly and with plenty of attention!  We had a bad experience at Giada the night before, so our new favorite is Lago!  Can't wait to go back again next trip!"}
{"text":"We had 10+ dishes.  We all liked seafood with linguine and most people liked lobster with gnocchi.  Both dishes were 4 stars.  Good ambiance.  All the other dishes were mediocre.  Octopus was too salty specially black couscous.  Sashimi dish was really...please take if off the menu.  $20 parking didn't help.  When I spend about $100 per person I expect more than mediocre food.  If you go here for the fountain view which is great, try classic Italian dishes like seafood linguine or pizza."}
{"text":"Food: ***
Service: ****

I've been to Picasso and really enjoyed Julian Serrano's food. The food here was good, but was hit and miss. We ordered the crudo which was great, but the gnocchi was under seasoned and the octopus was pretty charred. The scallop puttanesca was really good, but unless you had a caper in the bite, calling it puttanesca might have been a stretch, but it was really fresh. The passion fruit mouse dessert was really good.

Service was outstanding throughout the night and he was able to answer all of our questions."}
{"text":"Called asked for reservations asked to be by the window to see the water show was told they will take it into consideration. We get seated in the busiest spot then we asked to sit by the window.. was told oh you checked in already and you've been here for 20 mins we can not seat you there... the food was great but portions were small too pricy and I did not know it was tapas style. One of the bussers took a plate away with food still on it right as I spooned a portion... pretty pissed since the portions were small and expensive and he took a quarter of the portion away.. great server but the ambiance was rushed made us feel anxious and uneasy..."}
{"text":"I do not like writing about unpleasant experiences nor do I like giving one star. However...Ive had a pretty unpleasant experience here. While staying at the Aloft, I ordered Lago from the in room menu. By the time I got the food on my table, the cost was already double what I would have paid had I stepped down. Furthermore, the delivery guy lied to my face and told me that tip is separate from the already high delivery fees.

I ended up going down and speaking to the manager, who did give me the tip back that I paid on top of the room service fee and apologized for the issue. However, this totally ruined my experience and I would have expected the manager to go a little further than just getting me the money that was \"stolen\" from me and either comp the rest of the meal or offer a gift card of some sort to compensate for this horrific experience and the blatant lies of his staff, who deserve to be fired for incidents like this. 

Outside of this specific incident, it would have been nice for them to note the applicable delivery fees on the aloft menu, which are ridiculously high. There wasn't a word about it.

Oh, and pizza was average at best."}
{"text":"Lago is fantastic!  There are mixed reviews here for Lago but in my opinion, there was nothing not to love about this place. The food was excellent. Everything prepared wonderfully and creatively. The menu is very diverse and creative as well. The duck was exceptional. 
The service was fast, friendly and accurate.  The views are the best of the strip in my opinion.   You just can't beat dinner here if you want a great Vegas experience. 
    If you have not been here, you must come at least once. You will be very happy you did. It's a gorgeous restaurant with gorgeous views!  I will be back and would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a great time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal we had on our recent 10 day trip to Vegas. It was simply outstanding. The restaurant itself is stylish and appealing to the eye. The view of the fountains was unreal and the service staff were very very friendly and efficient.  We tried the octopus which was absolutely superb, the scallops were also very good as was the bruschetta and the cheese plate. The tripe risotto was pretty good though the serving size seemed large compared to other tapas offerings. I would strongly recommend this place for a great meal. As some have said, it is loud.... I personally like it as it provides an \"alive\" air to the experience but if you expect or want a very quiet, dark dining experience try elsewhere. IF you want excellent food and comfortable surroundings with a great view then definitely go here...."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and unique. Small plates to share. View was incredible. Didn't completely kill the wallet. Backed."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great atmosphere. Excellent service. Large selection of delicious food and wines. I love the tapas style Italian selection here. My husband and I had the hamachi crudo, bruschetta al
Pomodoro, burrata, mushroom risotto & fussillioro pasta. Plenty for 2 hungry diners! Some of the best bruschetta we've ever had! Hamachi has a bit of a kick to it (the oil), risotto was yummy! And husband loved the pasta with lamb ragout (fussillioro). Definitely recommend this spot! Requested and seated by the ginormous windows so had the additional benefit of the fountain show every 15 minutes. Great, attentive staff. Can get pricey fast though! Definitely a great, 5 star worthy dinner location."}
{"text":"A group of us had dinner here this evening.

We ordered and shared some appetizers. I tried the Calamari - it was tasty, had a nice bit of heat, but the texture of the Calamari was borderline chewy, almost rubbery. Not how I like my Calamari.

I ordered a Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA (Fat Head's Brewery, North Olmstead, OH). It was a delicious IPA - very piney, resinous, nice bitter flavor. Awesome IPA!

For dinner I ordered the Caesar salad and an order of the Meatballs. The salad was overdressed - to much salad dressing. Having stated that - the flavor was decent, although I like my anchovies to be a tad saltier. The meatballs, in contrast, were excellent! As I recall, I believe they were a mixture of pork, veal, and beef. Very hearty and served in a sumptuous tomato sauce!

Service was good.

Two other cons - from my perspective - it was far to dark in the dining area. I understand about wanting to set the tone ambiance-wise - but I felt it was a tad to gloomy. And it was a tad on the cold side in the dining area."}
{"text":"I was pleased with Lago with everything from its setup to its food to its service.  The restaurant was clean while its artistic decor suggested a rustic Italian feel.  The service was great -- our waiter was very attentive and gave us tips on the food and even a trick to eating shellfish.

The food here was delicious.  I was actually surprised at how delicious the pre-dinner tapenade was.  I don't usually eat bread before a meal, but I (and the other four people in our party) could not resist a slice of bread with this sun-dried tomato blend.  One of salads came with goat cheese croquettes, which were not only impressive, but addictive.  The gnocchi was better than usual as it wasn't too dense or starchy.  Not only did it have great texture, but the bits of lobster definitely added to the dish.  The burrida is a fantastic seafood concoction of shellfish and calamari that's perfect for any seafood lover.  They also had a special dish of mushroom ravioli topped with a filet cut of steak.  The ravioli was a little bitter, but it really balanced out with the cream-sauce and steak.  I was satisfied that my steak was cooked to order and completely devoured it.  Even though there was a lot of sharing going on at the table, I actually didn't want to give up any of my dish.

Even though the food took a while to get to us and the overall meal was a little overpriced, I would still highly recommend Lago.  They make their own fresh pasta for their entrees, accommodate to your requests, and are definitely one of the tastier restaurants in the Tremont area."}
{"text":"Lago provides a modern and chill atmosphere. The presentation of the restaurant and food was on-point and staff team members were pleasant. I'm not sure what's Lago's demographic target is, but what I can say is that it's not me. 

I live for food. While most people talk about orgasms I'm all about foodgasms. I care about quality over quantity & overall harmony and complexity. I wish the food tasted as great as it looked, or tasted as good as it was expensive. The highlight of my night was the bread and seasonal pistachio mousse. 

(Beef/ veal/ pork)MEATBALLS- heard that it was a must.. personally, unimpressed and wouldn't get it again even if it were half the price. Yet, it is worth a try!
CAULIFLOWER- whole roasted, dominated with parmesan. I saw herbs, but couldn't taste them. Honestly, I could have made it better in my kitchen with a preferable nutritional fact sheet. 
TROUT- the only thing that I liked on the plate was the burnt lemon, and haha, only for the idea. I think a lot of people don't know what fresh seafood is like. Let me explain it this way, if it smells fishy it sure seems fishy. Bro, it's not suppose to smell like lake erie.
CAVATELLI- I guess it's kinda like adult Mac n cheese. I really liked the well-seasoned baked cheese on the top but that's it. The white sauce mixture was unpleasantly rich, the mushrooms were few and weak.

Overall this experience is why I hesitate to branch out and try new restaurants. When it comes to food I conclude that Lago cuts corners that food snobs will notice.... but damnnnnnnnn, look at that wall-art!

Cost-benefit analysis: .... nahh, enough said. I've made a huge mistake. Should have picked the steakhouse. Save yourself!"}
{"text":"Had a drink here before and after an event upstairs.  Day bartender was cool, night bartender was arrogant.  Place is a litte stuffy for me but when there is an open tab and Im already feelin good, it will do juast fine.  Didnt try the food.  Italian food bores me to tears but Ill drink my ass off here again...."}
{"text":"Too pricey
Not authentic 
Like many other restaurant in this area they push u to purchase a drink.  If I am visiting an area, I prefer to spend money in enjoying the meal not so much the beverages."}
{"text":"Not worth it if you didn't get a reservation. They will give side tables in the corner and food choices were poor. Manager was not competence we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the decor and the view! I sat by the windows and was able to watch the Bellagio fountains during dinner. The concept of the restaurant is Italian tapas, so don't come too hungry unless you plan to eat most of the menu. They recommend around 3-4 plates per person, with tax and tip our party spent around $70.00 a person. Everyone in my party was happy with their meal and service was impeccable. Their waiters and staff were very friendly and attentive and did a great job of providing suggestions and making sure we had a pleasant experience. Our favorite part of the meal was dessert, definitely save room for it!"}
{"text":"After a long week, I needed a break... And I needed a drink... And I needed dinner. Thankfully, I found Lago. 

I started the evening the right way, with a mojito. It had just the right balance of fresh and sweet. It also had a nice, fruity kick. 

The culinary journey continued with the summer squash soup. It was hearty, yet refreshing. 

Perhaps the top highlight of the night was the linguine pesto. The pesto was so rich, so green, so earthy (in a good way!), and so satisfying. The shaved almonds and grated parmesan added extra layers of flavor that completed the dish so perfectly.

And finally, I couldn't help but try the mortadella flourless chocolate cake. Whoa! Come through, shaved edible gold! And that was just the start of it, as there were so many layers for chocoholics to enjoy.

I must admit I wasn't blown away the first time I passed by Lago, as the exterior gives a bit of a \"cafeteria\" vibe. That all changed when I stepped inside. Not only are the fountain and Strip views amazing, but the food & drinks are out of this world as well."}
{"text":"We were excited to dine here due to the fact it was in the Bellagio and you could watch the fountains as you ate. The view is the only reason I rate it a 2 star. 

The tapas style was a bit confusing and not explained to us very well. The portions were very small and overpriced. When I asked for pasta to go with my veal the waiter looked at me like I was nuts. He said I'll try to figure that one out. $16 later I get what looks like was heated in a square bowl and plopped on a plate. No seasoning, no sauce- nothing- just a dry cup of noodles that cost about .50. 

The waiter was rude, arrogant and made us feel like we were a complete waste of his time. He may have overheard me complain and started acting halfway decent. Either that or he realized it was close to tip time. 

I will not eat here again. I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Este restaurant nos gusto muchísimo. 

La persona que nos atendió si fue un amor y cheverisimo todo, la comida increíble! la vista espectacular y la decoración del restaurant una belleza!

Lo único malo las anfitrionas de la puerta no se portaron muy bien, estábamos con mi abuela en silla de ruedas con 90 años que se quería sentar afuera por que tenía mucho frío etc y ellas se pusieron de mal humor."}
{"text":"Lago is a pleasantly modern restaurant located within the Bellagio. I would say that the overall aesthetic appeal of the place is very nice. They bring out a tablet menu for the desserts and drinks...although I'm not quite sure why that is necessary when there are actual menus for the entrees and the rest of the food? I can't speak much for the food aside from the fact that it was good yet with smaller portions than one could have hoped for. I did, however, end up ordering and sampling every dessert on the menu with my party. The desserts were also in small portions, but absolutely worth it! I would revist Lago in the future, but perhaps when they become a more developed restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love Lago.

The place is just all around a gem. The vibe is chill (although I'm only been there during lunch hours), the service is brilliant and the food is AMAZING. I just recently went for the first time and I already can't wait to go back. I decided to go light and had the beet salad: SO TASTY! I can't want to try the dinner menu soon."}
{"text":"Lago is the total package. In my opinion, it doesn't get much better than this. As soon as you see the colorful exterior from the casino you can already feel the energy. It's got a youthful, fresh vibe inside and amazing modern architecture. On it's opening night, we had the pleasure of sitting on the patio overlooking the best view of the Bellagio fountain show. It's pretty much right on top of you. The food is, of course, unreal (wouldn't expect anything less from Julian Serrano). And the service, of course, impeccable. I'd recommend starting your night off with the Sgroppino cocktail. An explosion of prosecco in your mouth. Literally, it's a frozen sphere. As for the food, here are just a few of my favorite dishes: The chicken liver crostini, gnocchi with blue cheese, slow-cooked short ribs, lamb ragu, and the salmone crudo. Those are only a handful of the many small plates offered, but you really can't go wrong here. Lago is a perfect new addition to Bellagio and to the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"For a fairly expensive restaurant, Lago was quite mediocre. A couple of our tapas were actually pretty good but others fell short. The salmon for instance was way overcooked and very dry and when we sent it back, we got a new one that was medium-rare in the center but again almost overcooked on the outside.

The wine by the glass list was just adequate but by no means impressive. The wines were not special even at $30/glass.

The views of the Bellagio fountains were certainly a plus and we got a table with a view even if not right by the windows."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. It had amazing food, great service, and such a phenomena view. I went for my birthday and had no clue what to order and really didn't want to pick. We told our waiter that we didn't know what to order and he worked with the chef to create a tasting menu! We also had the most amazing view of the fountains. The serve was so sweet constantly checking on me to make sure I had a great birthday. They also brought me the best of best birthday desert, a sampling of all their items! 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Made reservations here and we got sat right by the window to see the fountain. It was a very beautiful view. My friend and I both got the passion fruit mojito which was good. We then tried the pork ribs alone and it was so tender and good. The plate was small though so it was gone quick. We also had the seafood risotto and it was awesome. Perfectly made and packed with flavor. We also ordered two desserts. The creme brûlée and some chocolate mouse cake ish dessert. Both were good but I have to say I liked the creme brûlée better. This place is a tapas style so everything is small and shareable. It's a bit expensive and our mojito cost more than the pork rib tapa that we ordered. If you're more on the hungry side order something from the entree instead of tapas. It was a beautiful experience here."}
{"text":"Front service is horrible. We had a 9:00 p.m.reservation and ended up being seated at 9:20pm.  The waitresses in the lounge area just kept walking by and finally when we got somone's attention she said she needed to get a pen and took another 5 min. Apparently she was too busy talking to several other servers.  Absolutely ridiculous they need to really get it together.  However, when we were seated we had a very nice and competent server which was very knowledgable and friendly. We had the tasting menu which was good.  Specialty drinks are pricey about $18-$19 and will definitely not give you a buzz and were nothing special. Great view of the fountains."}
{"text":"Ok I get that tapas are small plates but when you are paying $17-20 for a small (and by that I mean borderline minuscule) portion you should at least be impressed. We weren't impressed by much at Lago. 

The hostess was confused about when our table might be ready, which pretty much set the tone for our experience. We were seated at an oversized table (two of us) in a really loud restaurant so we had to sit on the same side so we could hear each other. Unfortunately this seating wasn't conducive to a great view of the fountains which mah have been a nice distraction to the busy, disorganized circus environment in the restaurant.  Ok, it had only been open a week so I can kind of forgive the organizational kinks the I'm sure will be ironed out.

We ordered bruschetta (ok but nothing special), langostina (one tiny one for $17), lamb chops (super fatty), filet mignon (just alright), cannelloni with short rib filling (our favorite of the meal but again ultra small) and 7 and 7 a gnocchi and lobster knuckles (pretty tasty), 2 desserts (very good) and a couple drinks each. Bill was about $200 and we were still kind of hungry when we left.

We won't be back to Lago and wouldn't recommend it very highly."}
{"text":"Still madly in love with Lago's vegetarian Mondays where there's an entire menu devoted to vegetarian and vegan food - including dessert!

Sadly, I never seem to see too many people partaking in this epic vegetarian feast.  (which is interesting, because I see people flocking in droves to another restaurant's monthly vegan night...hmmm)

Cleveland vegetarians, you owe it to yourself to check this place out..."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot - just be sure to make reservations and ask for a table with a view of the Fountains at Bellagio!

My husband and I ate here during the week on a recent trip to Vegas, making reservations about one day in advance for a late dinner.  The view of the Fountains during our meal was spectacular - I would recommend asking for a table up front towards the windows or on the patio for the best of the best.

The service was nice, but not as personalized or as steady as we expected.  Our server forgot to put in our appetizer and salad orders, and was slow to bring drinks from the bar, but overall he was polite and knew his way around the menu.

We had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, and it had a nice little kick to it from the garlic oil, then had the minestrone soup and the Ceasar salad as our next course.  The minestrone was extremely light but flavorful, and the Ceasar salad was crisp and nicely dressed - having those two dishes for lunch would definitely be a great idea!

We stuck to traditional favorites for our entrees, and the lasagna (not sure they have it every night), and the pappardelle did not disappoint.  Both were filling and you could really taste how fresh the pasta was.  I would recommend either one if you are going to have a multi-course meal, because even with all of that food, we still had room to try their gelato and maybe an extra martini or two. 

Overall, the beautiful atmosphere and view of the Fountains is probably enough to make us go back to Lago again (it truly is one of the most romantic restaurants we have been to in awhile in Vegas!), but it's the fact that the food is so fresh and so delicious that makes us want to recommend this restaurant to others as one of our new favorites in Vegas.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good was yummy!!! We had the scallop, pistachio salmon, duck, Pesto linguine. 
View of the fountain isn't perfect as there's a tall enough rail in front of the windows and you can't see most of the water/light show effect. And without the music accompanying the show, you definitely don't get the effect close to what intended. But the good was awesome."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner and it was an amazing experience! We sat on the outside patio right on at water and we're able to watch the big fountain show while we ate. Super nice. They had some shrimp appetizer that was out of this world. I had the mushroom risotto as my meal and loved it. We even got a free dessert for our anniversary! Def recommend for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant Week. The calamari was perfect and the sauce it was in was simply stunning. We dipped our bread in it after the calamari was gone because we had to eat it all up!The meatballs were to die for...sooo moist and saucy. The short ribs were amazing...I would highly recommend...they just fall apart and melt in your mouth, and the portion is huge too. The hubs ordered the lobster gnocchi. He loved it but I thought it just tasted like a bowl of melted butter. The butter was overkill and it was way too rich...more of a soup than a pasta dish. 
Get The panna cotta...it's perfection...soo Light, like you're eating air, or super-whipped whipped cream. 
Don't get the tiramisu. It's really nothing special and I was quite disappointed. It tasted store-bought and like it had been in the fridge for a few days. I'm not saying it was bad...just nothing special for an upscale Italian restaurant. Olive Garden's taste just as good, if not, better. 
Overall, very nice experience!"}
{"text":"Review is really 2-3 stars for the food. 5 stars for the setting.

What a view, fabulous to have the Bellagio fountains on display. Nice decor, comfortable seating.

The food was tasty, but not more than elsewhere. We were disappointed by the appetizers: the only standout was the cheese plate that had unusual items. The heirloom tomatoes were not, and it was awkward to have 3 slices for 4 guests. The carpaccio was tasty, but can get that at a good deli. Funghi trifolati was perhaps the most original of the 4 appetizers. 

Did not appreciate the suggestion of 2-4 appetizers per person, before what is referred to as the main dishes. Also 2- 4 per person. really? There is Strip pricing and then ripoff.

For the main dishes, the Margherita pizette at 14 $ was overpriced. The short ribs were very very good: at least there were 4 pieces, about 1.5 inches square, for each guest. The branzino was fine, at three pieces. The ravioli al gamberi were fine. Wines by the glass are overpriced.

So overall, it was fair. It was very noisy but expected on a Saturday night. They have very large tables for groups and little acoustic dampening so....Service was attentive."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this restaurant. Came here for my birthday dinner we had a reservation and we were seated on the patio where we were able to enjoy the beautiful water show, the views were amazing. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had the best time. The food is really good we had the shared plates bites are small but very tasty. Drinks and desserts were exceptional. I had the best time and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"i just love love LOVE lago! Everything I've tasted from here is divine. The lobster gnocchi is amazing. by far the best gnocchi I've ever had, cooked to perfection (not toughish or chewy like gnocchi can be sometimes). The portion size was also perfect considering its kind of a rich meal. The pork chop w/peach ragu was also delicious, and the meat was so tender. I really enjoyed the panzanella salad. mmmm. another must-try is their veal tortellini. it's soo sooo good. they also sell it at taste of tremont, which is such an amazing deal. the service here is great. i can't wait to come back. definitely a great date spot."}
{"text":"Great experience at Lago's Sunday brunch! Beautiful view of the fountains, delicious food, excellent drinks (add on the all-you-can-drink mimosas/bellinis/bloody marys) and good service. We thoroughly enjoyed all three courses and the pastries! They have a chocolate fountain and cotton candy as part of the elaborate dessert bar."}
{"text":"The hostess here needs more training and was unprofessional. They mishandled my reservation and left me to wait at the bar area for my table. 30min later I had to go and check with the hostess to see what is going on, only to get a snide comment that I need to wait some more with no estimated time. She gets zero stars.

Everything else about the place was nice but the hostess was so terrible, I won't be leaving with a good impression of the place, just a massive headache."}
{"text":"I went with 3 of my girlfriends for Sunday Brunch.  It's the best brunch I've ever had in Las Vegas!!!  The food was simply delicious, my favorites were the  CRUDO DI TONNO (the tuna was so fresh) DUCK AND POLENTA (melts in your mouth goodness) and EGGPLANT PARMESAN BENEDIC. I made sure I saved some room for dessert.  The dessert bar was well stacked with different fruits and pastries..they even had a chocolate fountain :)  My belly was very satisfieds!!!
The main reason why I gave 5 stars because the service was excellent and the bottomless mimosas!!!  The GM Albert Najem made our experience very special.  Our server Derick was very attentive and made us feel comfortable.  We were treated like VIP's.  The decor is beautiful...loving all the arts and color schemes.  And who can forget the view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain while sipping on our mimosas, eating delicious food and great company! I  recommend LAGO as the top place to visit while your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very bad service 
The manager was rude 
And we wait a long time for a table
And we did reservation 
Don't go there choose other place
Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Food at Lago was great! We got:

- Focaccia with ricotta and honey (5/5)
- Hot eggplant salad (3/5)
- Margherita pizza (4/5)
- Gnocchi (5/5 if you like blue cheese)
- Risotto with funghi (4.5/5)

What really made the experience was the excellent service. The front desk let us wait past our reservation time to get one of the outside tables right in front of the fountains (patio is heated), and our waiter Carlos was great with suggestions and even helped take our photo which we appreciated."}
{"text":"Very nice room for small private parties. 
Possibly the best White Russian I've ever had. 
Calamari: 5 stars
Gnocchi: 5 stars
Chocolate cake w/ raspberry dessert: 3 stars
Overall it was expensive, but worth it. I would go back and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before their Fourth Of July party on the roof. Started out with bread and oil/balsamic, which was really yummy. I had the chicken. It was really good and perfectly seasoned, and I loved the doughy-potato things (can't remember their name lol) that came with it. Very attentive, fast service. Will definitely stop in again soon!"}
{"text":"Really great restaurant for dinner. One of my favourites from our trip to Las Vegas. The restaurant has a great view of the Bellagio fountains and is in a really great spot. 

The food is fantastic and so are the cocktails. I recommend trying the bed carpaccio and the Picasso cocktail. 

I'll definitely be back here again. 

Only let down was the iPads they use to show you dessert. Whilst this is a very cool method, we had a late dinner (10:30PM) and by the time we wanted to order dessert the iPad on our table ran out of battery. The waiter apologised and replaced it with another iPad, that again, ran out of battery as soon as he left our table. We took it as a sign not to have dessert and left it at that."}
{"text":"Lago is my favorite restaurant on The Strip. I should note I don't eat beef so if steak is your thing, this is probably not the restaurant for you. Also, if you want a giant pile of food on your plate for relatively short money this is also not your place. But if you like to tapas/small plates style of eating or if you don't want to leave feeling like you might burst then go here. 

Lago puts you eye level with the water show so ask for a window seat. It can be a bit loud in the restaurant during peak times (acoustics, not blasting music or anything like that) but if the weather is not too hot you can ask for outdoor seating and it is much quieter outside. It's the best outdoor seating on the Strip, and there's not a lot of outdoor seating on the Strip! Book in advance if you want window seats or outdoor seating. (Another good thing about Lago is it has a bathroom IN the restaurant so you don't have to walk out of the restaurant and into the casino. Which might not sound important, but it sort of is. Also, it is a really nice and private bathroom! Though, they do use sage scented hand soap which is the bane of my existence....)

I like to dress up and you won't feel overdressed at Lago if you want to get dressy. But you don't have to. Casino's will seat people wearing just about anything, so smart casual is fine. 

I would get a reservation for any Strip restaurant. You can always cancel if you change your mind. 

I love the food here. There's a sister restaurant in Aria- Jullian Serrano Tapas- which is equally good but is interior to the casino so has no views."}
{"text":"Neither my husband nor I were impressed. In fact, we were kind of disgusted. It was $130 for a meal that was not good at all. The service was fine but I would definitely except more for the price. Or at least something appetizing. 

It absolutely had the feel of being a hotel restaurant. Being from the area and coming down to the flats specifically for the meal at Lago, I expected more. We ordered the calamari which was not fried. It was fine, but covered in tomatoes and a liquidy, runny tomato sauce. We each ordered a salad as well. I had the lobster gnocchi and husband had the rigatoni. Every part of the meal, from beginning to end for me, was covered in tomatoes. Which would be fine if there were a couple but my salad, calamari, and pasta were all smothered by tomatoes. I don't mind them, but they aren't my favorite. The influx of tomatoes suggested the restaurant was lacking something? 

There are way too many GOOD or at least decent restaurants in cleveland. Plus this place just had a strangely high amount of health code violations. Save yourself from the nausea you'll experience from their food and go anywhere, literally anywhere, else."}
{"text":"Love Lago. There are things on the menu that I wouldn't normally like that I like here. The staff and atmosphere are great. Local tip: go for brunch!"}
{"text":"I think I'm in heaven!  Having been to a look-taste Yelp event before its official opening, I was eager to see what Lago was all about in its every-night persona.  This joint sure is jumpin'.

We were first seated at a table near the window; it had a great view, but also was next to a table full of conventioneers whose decibel levels were off the charts.  We were moved to a slightly quieter one in a more contained room, but happily, it still had a great view of the fountains - it overlooked the patio, which was off-limits due to a private party.  Kudos to the phenomenal management team, who really took care of us and saw to it that we would have a first-class experience.

And it was uphill from there.  Our server, Jennifer, was terrific in every way:  friendly, efficient, and more than happy to offer her opinions of the various small plates. Chatting with her throughout our meal added a homey touch to the experience.  Likewise, her assistants - Ali, from Iran and Oscar, from Mexico City - also added to the warmth.  A bonus:  I got to practice my Spanish with Oscar and my rusty Italian with the manager, and I felt like we were on a trip.  Well, we were, and it was fueled by the bottle of Prosecco we shared.

Some of the dishes we ordered were repeats, because we loved them last time:  the chilled tomato soup; the expertly cooked white and green asparagus; the red wine risotto that every reviewer raves about; the delectable short ribs canneloni.  But it wouldn't be any fun without trying some new plates.  I positively inhaled the 7 and 7 - seven gnocchi, which were hands down the best I've ever tasted, served with seven lobster knuckles.  Who knew lobsters had knuckles??  I rate this dish 14 YUMS.  Two delicious lamb chops were followed by a new taste for my husband: veal tonnato - thinly sliced room-temp veal with a light tuna sauce, enhanced with capers and pignoli.  This is a dish I used to order years ago at an ahead-of-its-time restaurant in upstate New York but haven't had since.  I loved it here, and the toasted pignoli were something I hadn't sampled on this before; they definitely added another level to it.

We don't usually order dessert, but knew we had to here.  Who could resist the crisp mini cannoli, ultra-crisp and with a tasty filling thinner than what I'm used to.  Thinner isn't a negative here.  And it won't apply after this Dionysian feast, either, when I get on the scale tomorrow!  Equally irresistible, and even better, was the Giandujotto, a hazelnut mousse atop a chocolate cake round that was moist and dense, with a tiny scoop of hazelnut ice cream on top of another chocolate round.

So what's not to like?  The noise.  This is not a place to have an intimate tête-a-tête, but rather a high-energy, fun place with a definite Vegas vibe.  And great food and service.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was sensational, the view of the water fountains and strip spectacular, the decor very cool and vibrant, service fantastic and the food ... way too much, and not badly priced either. A WINNER!"}
{"text":"I feel so torn about this place. First the good:
-minimal and geometric decor. Very spacey/jetsons meets Vegas dining. Hostesses have a space dress and you half expect a hostess with green skin or a third boob to come flying out of the kitchen doors
-love that you don't feel like you are next to the casino and the large windows to see the bellagio fountains
- great menu variety and reasonable price points
- my favorite dishes: (1) octopus with squid ink cous cous. It will dye your mouth but the best octopus I've ever had. Had a lobster claw consistency (2) gnocchi in lobster sauce. Very light and flavorful (3) panna cotta. Just really light and refreshing (4) salumi platter.

The bad:
- the scallop crudo dish. This thing STUNK. And yes the flavor was not as fishy but the smell itself was so offensive that I could not forget about it the entire night
-steak. It was not my choice to order it. This was not a restaurant that had great land options. This was over cooked and had a strong char taste. 

All in all, I feel like the good was really good but it was just too hit or miss and inconsistent to give it more stars. I'll try again and choose dishes that I want next time."}
{"text":"FOOD was scrumptious! From the bread to the main course! We had no more room for dessert. We started with the mussels - I wanted to lick the bowl!! We then had the beef short rib, the pork porterhouse, and the lobster gnocchi. I couldn't finish the gnocchi, but wow, absolutely delicious! Will definitely return if we ever go back to Cleveland. Lago was conveniently located in our hotel (Aloft) building."}
{"text":"Great view if you get the right seat. Large glass windows along backside. Was a little disappointed in the food quality however. In vegas the competition in great so unless its superb it's rare you need to return to average spots."}
{"text":"I like the location.  You get an open air view behind the Fountains at the Bellagio.  The decor is fresh, clean lines and it just feels crisp.  The menu is upscale Italian fare. Most I couldn't pronounce correctly but I enjoyed my meal.  Loved the view.  You can have a nice meal and conversation.  It's not loud where you have to strain to try and hear your company.  Overall had a pleasant experience.  It's surrounded by high end shops which was nice."}
{"text":"Another date occurred here, so I did not take photos again :( But anyways! I was loving this place. My dinner started off with sangria. Yum. Then there was the calamari appetizer. Oh my god. I loved this dish so much because for once the calamari wasn't breaded. Instead it seemed like they boiled it in the sauce. Ugh, dear lord, love it. My entree was the baked mushroom cavatelli. It was cheesy goodness. My dinner companion, who actually suggested the place, got some sort of pizza. He picked off the seeds from the peppers, that's all I remember. I'm going to assume it was delicious though. 

As a side note, parking was annoying. I had to pay to park across the street for around $7 on a Wednesday night. Seriously? The place was dead. I don't venture to this area often, and later found out there is a parking garage right behind Lago. Maybe it is cheaper to park there. Also, if I ever end up here again I would love to try the kobe carpaccio."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here before, just be aware that it is tapas style. The portions are very small. We had already sat down and ordered drinks when we found this out so we didn't feel comfortable leaving.  We also didn't want to spend a lot so we ended up just getting a few plates and did not get full. 

The restaurant did not have reservations available for quite a while so we ended up at the bar tables. The chairs were not very comfortable. 

I ordered the veal piccata which was pretty tasty. My husband ordered shrimp pasta and did not find it quite as satisfying. 

We had wanted to go to Olive but it was booked up for a private event. Next visit  we plan to skip Lago and make reservations for Olive"}
{"text":"Really really disgusting overpriced food. We were a party of 10, this is shared opinion. 
Some appetizers are ok like, but main course is a disaster. I ordered a steak medium well which came out bloody. After I asked them to cook it again it was still way undercooked. The meat quality is very low.
They use a lot of oil and sauce to mask the low quality of food. 
Do yourself a favor and go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not the best of places. We went with a big group (18 people) and the chef offered to do a tasting menu for 60-80 bucks. Sounded like a great idea but what we got was a LOT of carbs- pasta, polenta, more pasta...did i mention there was pasta? Would have liked more fish and greens. Of the things we ate, the quality was meh at best. They did have these little semolina cakes with cheese that were delicious.

I will say they have a small outdoor space- great spot to watch the fireworks. If you're going to go, I'd try the food a la carte!"}
{"text":"Must've been an off night for me... Stopped in for few apps before a show.  Had such high expectations but it fell flat.  Scallop was too small and over cooked and the veal agnolotti filling was dry.  Both weren't that hot either, which was annoying.  However, the fava on flatbread with guanciale was excellent, even though it came out too piping hot. Ugh."}
{"text":"Fantastic location, but just above-average food. It's definitely a very \"Vegas\" experience. Great view of the Bellagio fountains. And the whole pig served up on a platter is something worth trying once."}
{"text":"Truly an exceptional & extraordinary experience at Lago, the swanky decor and front row seating of the magical fountains sets the tone for your dining experience!  Service was impeccable from our server, she was so sweet & kind and went above & beyond for us to make this one unforgettable getaway.  We ordered a little bit of everything to try off the menu, and let me just say flavors of love in every bite, especially the amazing polenta & pasta dishes consumed. 

Definitely will return when in Vegas as Lago offers all the Bells & Whistles & glitter for any sweet occasion. Ciao"}
{"text":"Had a reservation and we were seated immediately on the outside patio. The view of the bellagio fountains were amazing. We ordered total of 7 tapas dishes and a dessert. Left super full and very satisfied. 
 The best dishes were the red wine risotto, a must get, and the 7 & 7 lobster pieces with toasted gnocchi. The octupus with squid ink and scallop cruddo was also good. The lamb chops were alright, had better. The prosciutto wrapped quail was rather a dissapointment as it was way too salty. The grilled mushroom were also very good. Overall, most dishes were very good. Had the panna cotta for dessert, it was very light, just tad sweet, amazing finish to the meal. The food, the view, and the service was amazing. Will definitely be back next time I'm in vegas to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I'd been hearing all kinds of positive buzz about Lago, since it had only opened to the public a week or two before my arrival in Vegas.  I assumed that scoring a reservation would be damn near impossible -- especially since my visit coincided with Vegas Uncork'd -- and no seats appeared to be available on OpenTable.  However, the Bellagio concierge took pity and managed to save me a seat at the bar.  Score!

I was totally thrilled to get this reservation, because Lago is simply marvelous.  It's the latest concept from Julian Serrano, featuring Italian small plates.  Located right on Lake Bellagio (where Circo used to be), the space is bright and inviting, with lots of whites and cool blues and intricate glass tilework.  The fountain show wasn't running the night I dropped by, due to inclement weather, but that didn't seem to bother anyone.  The vibe inside was just electric.

After being seated, I was greeted by Will, who's probably the friendliest and most courteous bartender I've met on the Strip.  He wasted no time getting a cocktail in front of me.  I opted for the Sicilian \"gin and tonic\" with a crispy orange chip and blood orange spheres.  This cocktail was simply gorgeous, and packed a serious kick.  Lago definitely puts a lot of thought into its cocktail program.

Since the menu was done in the style of small plates, I decided to try an array of different items.  Five plates seemed right for a reasonably hungry person:

1.  Nduja crostini with spicy pork sausage and gorgonzola
2.  Capasanta -- scallop crudo with blood orange and pistachio
3.  Short rib cannelloni with parmesan fonduta and tomato
4.  Quagia saltimbocca -- boneless quail with prosciutto
5.  Ravioli al gamberi -- ravioli with shrimp, mascarpone, and tomato

Picking a favorite from these dishes is damn near impossible, since I adored them all for different reasons.  The nduja had a nice spice, which was a good contrast to the cool and fresh scallop crudo.  The canneloni was probably the most traditional item, but the flavor was amazing.  The quail was rich and decadent without being heavy.  The ravioli pretty much melted in my mouth.

Even after all this delicious food, I knew I couldn't leave without trying one of their mouthwatering desserts.  Will recommended the Giandujotto -- hazelnut ice cream with hazelnut/chocolate cream encased in a chocolate shell, all served with chocolate ribbons.  This dessert was stunning to look at and tasted fabulous as well.  Yeah, it's pretty much an Instagrammer's dream come true.

Something about Lago puts its guest in a great mood, because everyone sitting near me was more chatty and outgoing than usual, and wanted to know every detail about the food I was ordering.  Lago truly feels like a destination restaurant for Vegas food aficionados, and that's reason enough for me to return."}
{"text":"The newest addition to the strip is Lago by Julian Serrano, located in the Bellagio.  Upon arrival you are greeted by your hostess' that are really friendly and talkative when escorting you to your table.

We made a last minute reservation on open table so we had a high top table near the kitchen.  Everything is white, bright and shiny.  Italian inspired furniture and decor, it is both modern and clean.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  If you are able to secure seats near the lakeside, you will be amazed.

The food is tapas style.  One order is perfect for sharing for two.  Our dining for the night included:

Zuppa Di Pomodoro - a tomato bisque with mozzarella 

Nduja - a spicy sausage spread and gorgonzola on toasted bread

Salumi - platter of 3 different cured meats with thin crusted bread

Spaghetti Chitarra - olive oil based sales with tomatoes and clams
 
Risotto Al Vino Rossi - risotto made with red wine and burrata 

Paccheri Al Telefono - tube pasta in tomato sauce topped with mozzarella 

Alle Olive Verde - focaccia topped with roasted green olives and pecorino 

Langostino - broiled in shell with lemon oil 

Dessert

Lemon Curd Almalfi - with lemon Sorbetto 

Classics Tiramisu - with coffee gelato

Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - topped with grapefruit and mango Sorbetto 

Everything we had was very delicious.  I absolutely loved everything.  All the dishes were the perfect size for sharing.  They all were very flavorful, yet simple.

Our service was friendly and attentive.  Drinks were constantly refilled.  We were checked on by servers, busers and management.  Food came out fast and furious.  Our first set of orders came out in 10 minutes.  
 
Don't expect a quiet leisurely dining experience here, as its lively and loud in this place.  The cost was very reasonable for strip and Bellagio dining.  Everything came out to about $175.  Cheap by celeb chef dining standards.  I can honestly say this is my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Come for the view and stay for the food! This place is gorgeous. 

Met my boss and my boss' boss here for dinner this evening. Originally I attempted reservations at a different restaurant that was booked so at the recommendation of the reservationist I chose here as plan B and was not disappointed. 

The decor is not Italian style, but rather extremely modern. Clean lines, lots of white crisp surfaces, and unique furniture abound. But what is really amazing is the outdoor dining option right on the balcony overlooking the Bellagio's water show. It was absolutely stunning! I'd be curious to know how many proposals a year happen here!

They don't sit back on the laurels of the view either. Dinner was delicious. I had the tenderloin and asparagus which was cooked exactly as requested. Everyone was pleased with their meal in our party. Topped it off with a perfectly prepared cappuccino and we were ready for our big evening. 

Really the 5th star withheld just because of the price. If you have a drink or 2 def be prepared to pay a bill or so per person. Regardless, I'd def come back again."}
{"text":"Great little Italian corner.  Swung by on Valentines day for a late light dinner...

The menu was customized for Valentines day, and was very good...

We had a melted brie/bleu en croute  appetizer with sugared walnuts, great, a solid watercress salad with grilled shrimp, a good grilled chicken in foie gras consomme with truffle oil baked potatoes, and a great pistachio mouse for dessert...great wine collection too.

Try it!"}
{"text":"Brunch review. 

3 - MAC CARBONARA (pancetta | egg yolks | pecorino | black pepper)

3 - ITALIAN SAUSAGE FRIED EGG BURGER (house made Italian sausage | fried egg)
3 - BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS AND SHRIMP (saffron risotto)

++ View/setting (Water side table facing the fountain)

Overall, average brunch, but great view/seats. \"I'm a fan.\""}
{"text":"What an excellent dinner at Lago! The restaurant itself is very modern looking and you cannot beat the view from behind the Bellagio fountains looking towards Paris-Las Vegas! My boyfriend and I picked Lago for our \"fancy\" dinner while out in Vegas and we were not disappointed. We ordered four of the entrees (really tapas) and every single one was gone within twenty minutes. The shrimp ravioli was by far my favorite of the four we had. We also ordered meatballs that were good, but nothing that you can't have somewhere else. The bread with the buffalo/Gorgonzola spread was delicious and I would definitely order it again. 
I really liked how they provide you an iPad to browse and order your drinks from. The pictures are fantastic to look at and its more fun than just wondering what that fancy cocktail is going to look like. I've attached pictures of our two drinks; pineapple mojito and raspberry purée Bellini. Obviously this being Vegas, it was pretty pricey so we stayed away from the wine list and only had those two drinks the entire evening.
Service here is absolutely spot on. Our waiter was awesome and I noticed the same around the entire restaurant. No wine or water glass was ever left empty and plates were cleared before you could even blink.
With our two drinks and four tapas meals, our bill came to $100 even (without tip). The only complaint I have is that it got REALLY loud as the evening went on. We left about 9 so I'm not sure if that was just people get amped up for the night or because the space isn't huge. Either way, it did not ruin the night at all. I strongly recommend Lago for a wonderful meal and amazing view while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ambience, food and great location. We enjoyed everything we had. Definitely a great place!"}
{"text":"Good choice for a non-traditional Italian restaurant in Vegas.   Beautiful contemporary decor with a vibrant bar.   View of the Bellagio fountain show every 30 mins.  

Most selections are small plates so be sure to share and order quite a few.  Some of our favorites included the short rib cannelloni, Caprese salad, and the linguini al pesto.  The only disappointment was the very small pizza that had a slightly off tasting red sauce.  

If you are interested in patio dining, be sure the weather will accommodate and make the request when the reservation is made."}
{"text":"I want to start off saying I had the most lovely brunch today at Lago @ the Bellagio. I am a 32 year old female who dined with a friend just before we had to go to the airport. I have been living in Chicago for 10 years now--so I've eaten at some great places--and do not consider myself a foodie, but I like to enjoy a nice meal and finally have the means to treat myself (or Treat. YO. SELF.).

We made reservations for 11AM because we obviously wanted a fountain seat. We were the first people at the restaurant and were greeted by the entire staff + Julian Serrano as we walked in. And from that point forward we only had exceptional service. I have tons of severe food allergies (where I have an epi pen) and they were more than accommodating. 

THE FOOD
This review is for Brunch only. It's a pre fixe menu for $38/person. You get a fancy pastry basket, plus you get to pick 2 items from a list on the menu: I went for the duck and then the steak--I will say that some of the items are non traditional breakfast items and seem a bit on the heavy side for breakfast. But HELLO, I am also on vacation and why not?! Everything I ate was outstanding. I am not sure why people are complaining about this food.... can you cook this yourself, I would like to ask? Where are you eating that you are getting this type of food that is cheaper than $38/person? A side of bacon in Chicago is $5. So yea.... not sure why anyone would be complaining. We also got the $28 \"bottomless mimosas\" which also works for Bellini's and Bloody's. Most places do not let you cross order between drink types if they have a \"bottomless\" deal going on, so I was impressed I could order all three drink types (or more!) at the $28 price. Personally I think that was also a great deal, especially for Vegas, where I spent $19 on a cranberry vodka at The Encore Beach Club. And it was THE FANCIEST mimosa I have ever seen. It had a gold dusted raspberry on it! And it wasn't short on booze at all! 

THE VIEW
We got the middle seat on the patio aka the best view in the house. If anything, it was worth just going to see the fountain show with music playing in the background. What a great view! I also think the restaurant is beautifully decorated. SO FUN!

BOTTOM LINE
If I am ever in Vegas again, I would absolutely stop in for dinner. In 2015, I think in general, people's expectations for everything have gotten a little unrealistic that basically everything is a let down. I honestly have never seen or tasted a mimosa like the one I had today (there was gold on my raspberry!) in front of a beautiful fountain, on a sunny day, on a beautiful patio, with music playing in the background, eating steak, getting waited on. If that isn't worth your hard earned money, than I am not sure what is!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a nice brunch. Gorgeous decor with different fresh flowers on each table. Fantastic view of the fountain. Great service. Delicious filet and lasagna, although some items like the potatoes and calzone are too salty. Best dessert buffet with lots of fruits, cakes, cookies, chocolate fountain, and cotton candy."}
{"text":"Great dinning experience. My server Rebecca was amazing. She made great recommendations. Found my new love of the Kobe Carpaccio.  The wine selection was incredible. A great place to hit before or after an Indians, Cavs or Browns game."}
{"text":"The food here is not bad, but in a city full of culinary goodness, it just doesn't stand out. We had the chicken liver crostini (would get this again), the lamb ragu pasta (very typical, pasta itself could have been better), 7x7 (cute concept, 7 small potato gnocchi and 7 lobster knuckles; gnocchi was a little starchy for me but the lobster was delish), the quail (a little salty, but overall pretty good), and the market fish (liked the caponata underneath, fished cooked nicely, but nothing wow at the end of the day). I realize I sound super picky but hey, it's the details and subtleties that matter!

I did really like the cocktail I had. I can't remember the exact liquor but it was rimmed with smoked salt and I would definitely recommend that. Great view of the fountain as well, which was unfortunately marred by the screaming child at the table next to us..."}
{"text":"Horrendous service.

I went with a group of friends. I wanted pasta, and cannot have dairy due to my infant's intolerance (breastfeeding). I noticed that all of the dishes I wanted had dairy, so I explained to the waiter that I couldn't have dairy, and asked \"which of these pasta dishes would be easiest to make dairy free?\" His response was \"none.\" I repeated my request & he said \"your dinner would be very plain and it wouldn't taste as good.\" I told him that was fine with me, and yes please, I would like plain pasta. He said \"no, that wouldn't taste as good, we won't do it.\" He then said \"I'm going to go take everyone else's order so you can find something else\" and moved on to the rest of the table.

He acted like my child's intolerance was an affront to their chef. The salmon was fine & the location was great but I would never come back due to the extremely rude staff and unaccommodating nature."}
{"text":"Their food is ok. Small and fancy. Good quality but nothing stands out. If you get seating on the patio, the view is amazing!  I would go here more for ambiance than the food."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch.
Nice mimosas and delicious food.
Loved the chocolate fountain. 
Perfect size for sharing with friends.
Well recommended place and great service from our waitress Monique."}
{"text":"This is a very rare beautiful elegant restaurant in side the Bellagio Hotel. Although I want to keep it a secret just for myself I have to share it with you guys please come see and watch the Bellagio water show on the patio"}
{"text":"Just simply stunning! From the staff to the food!  Eemer (sp?) was so knowledgeable about the wine and recommended a FABULOUS Pinot Grigio \"Livio Felluga\".  Far and about the best I have ever had.  The view is outstanding watching the Bellagio's fountain show. The service was perfect, everything was coursed out properly, we didn't feel rushed at all. We were 12 people on a Saturday night.  So much fun, I wish I remembered the name of everything we had but it was all amazing! Crab and Gnocci, Gorgoeus ravioli, lamb chops... It kept coming and it was all delicious.  If you can get there it is truly a treat! And if you are lucky enough to get Eemer the pixie like feisty little blonde with an Irish accent to help you out, you'll be in excellent hands.  Wish we could eat there ever night!"}
{"text":"Lago has one of the most enticing views on the strip.  You're in the front row to watch the Bellagio Fountains and have nice mirrored view of Paris, Planet Hollywood and The Cosmo, all while enjoying the new, classy environment that the designers have created.  I definitely recommend sitting outside, if seating is available.  I went for lunch and loved it.  Their signature cocktail looked TO-DIE-FOR!  The portions are fairly small, so I recommend ordering at least one side in addition to your main course.  Anything you order will likely taste great!  You are paying Bellagio prices, plus a premium for the view and good service."}
{"text":"I loved the food here. Lago would make for a great date night or even for a group or larger party. You've got to be prepared to pay for it though because its menu prices are pretty expensive for what I've experienced in Cleveland. Most of their entrees will run you $20-30. Their happy hour deals look pretty good from the menu online. I asked about the happy hour deals once we were seated and was disappointed to find out that it was only offered in the bar area because I didn't see that listed anywhere on their site.

A few friends and I decided to check this out for Restaurant Week because one of them had been there before. Like I mentioned, the food was delicious. I had the breaded cauliflower appetizer which had a surprising little kick to it due to the chile.  It was also incredibly salty which may be an issue for some. The entree was the beef short rib. When it came out, it came with brussel sprouts as opposed to the advertised broccoli. I thought I hated brussel sprouts so I was a bit upset, but they were tasty too! The short ribs were so tender although the portion seemed way too small if I were to come back and pay the regular price of $31. I capped off the meal with a chocolate lava cake that was the richest dessert I've had. 

I definitely want to come back and check out the happy hour. Other than that, the food was delicious but a little too cost prohibitive for me to want to come back any other time than Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"Come for the beautiful Bellagio fountain views, but stay for the food and drinks.

My group of 4 stopped by around 3pm and the main dining room wasn't open yet, so we sat by the bar area away from the windows. But since the patio was completely empty, we were still able to go out and take a few photos. Note to self: must make a reservation for their outdoor seating in the near future.

We all started with the Lago Cocktail - a pretty blue martini, a round ice cube with a flower frozen in the middle, and gold dust sprinkled on top. Forgot what alcohol was in it, but the bartender poured really heavy. 

For food, we shared the beef carpaccio and salmon crudo. One of my friends never tried raw beef or fish before, and she ended up loving the carpaccio. The salmon, however, was just okay. It only came with 4 tiny pieces and was a whooping $18. I'm all for expensive food that's worth it, but this was the one miss of the restaurant, so I have to dock off 1 star. Other than that, I'll be back to try their dinner menu next to the dancing fountains!"}
{"text":"i am going to give my last review of 2015 to.... Lago!

Our original dinner plan fell through, and since we were staying at Bellagio and i've been wanting to try this place... so i called around 830pm and surprisingly! i got a table, in the main dining room, with clear view of the fountain! 

the server (forgot his name... cute chubby guy!) was very helpful making suggestions for us, and everything we got was oh-so-yummy - especially the seafood risotto and the bone in rib eye! 

a complimentary bday cake for my dad was very thoughtful as well, loved the whole setting/decor, good for any occasions, it's also very romantic! would definitely be going back again and perhaps try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Don't miss Lago.  We came between lunch and dinner and they were serving the bar menu. It is outstanding. Polpo (octopus) came was a terrific couscous made with squid ink. I could go back for that couscous. They have best carpaccio we have had and we love carpaccio. The pizza was cepoline onions was excellent and they make great expresso.

We ordered beers because wine by the glass is about $20. and being early we did not want to pay that much without knowing when the wines had been opened. I think that is not a concern in the evening.

Loved the food and the service. Glad we went."}
{"text":"Recommend the meatballs and bruschetta. If you're at the bar look for Christopher, he's awesome. Sit on the patio if you can. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal. We got a nice table with a view of the fountains! Nice assortment of Tapas...mussels, meatballs, salads and their pizzas were great!"}
{"text":"Great spot if you want to see the Bellagio fountains.  The restaurant is located in the Bellagio and has a small outdoor porch that overlooks the fountains. 

Food is Italian served tapas style.  Basically, small portions.  I did not leave hungry.  It is a lot of money for a small portion.  In spite of that, I did not think my overall bill was unreasonable. 

Everything was great and had its own flavor.  

The meatballs were probably the favorite thing I ordered. 

You can get away with 2-3 of the tapas size dishes per person depending how hungry you are and I suggest sharing. 

The staff was great and did not rush."}
{"text":"Excellent service, appetizers amazing, rissotto and ribeye wonderful"}
{"text":"This is a stellar brunch choice! Three courses. Delicious mimosas and bloody marys! We ordered carbonara and ahi to start. The carbonara is off the charts--rich, flavorful, filling, so yummy! The tuna was a perfect pair with it,as it was very clean and light. If I could have a do over-- I'd order the duck though. It looked delish. Next was a calzone and the chicken. Both good choices. The calzone could've been better. Starting with simply putting fresh mushrooms in-- not the gross canned white ones. The crust was very nice and the ham was tasty. The dessert bar is quite a scene-- Chocolate fountain and cotton candy maker! The sweets were very good. 
Enjoyed the view of the bellagio fountain too. A lovely way to spend a Sunday !"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was excellent!  The decor and ambiance are very inviting.  We had a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains and it was spectacular.  The waiters know their food and wine menus!  Although they did mention that the portions are small and recommend ordering a few per person it was around 10pm so we ordered one plate per person and that was just perfect.  Two of us had the pasta with clams, shrimp and scallops in a tomato wine sauce....I have been dreaming about that plate every since! I am only sorry we didn't find this restaurant sooner but we will definitely be going back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all. I went here with a group of friends we made a reservation ahead of time and when we got there they said they cancelled our reservation because we were 10 mins late. Then we decided to just go somewhere else and all of a sudden they had a table ready for us so we just took the table instead of looking for a different restaurant. Their plates are way over priced for what you get it's an average of 16 dollars for a tapa. The first thing I ordered was butternut squash soup which is my favorite thing I was surprised they had it on the menu. The soup was so bland it didn't taste like much of anything I've had better butternut squash soup at chain restaurants to be honest. The next thing I ordered was a shrimp ravioli the shrimp on top of the ravioli were baby shrimp you would put on a salad they were also so over cooked they were chewy which is odd because my ravioli was actually slightly cold. My friend ordered a cheese board I was expecting it to be really nice but it was mediocre there were only three cheeses on the board there were no spreads or anything it was disappointing I've had way nicer cheeseboards that come with a lot more things on them for half the price of what she paid for the one at this restaurant. The service was quick I don't have anything I didn't like about that. It was nice how you could see the fountain going off while you eat your meal but if you just want to pay for atmosphere I recommend you just grab a drink here I don't recommend eating here it's really not worth it it is just a disappointment."}
{"text":"Had dessert and wine with my girlfriend this past weekend at Lago locates within the Bellagio hotel. The Creme Brûlée is almost as incredible as the front row view of the Bellagio water show. I would highly recommend calling ahead of time to make reservations for the scenic view. We did not eat dinner, however, the menu is based off of Italian tapas and few main courses that are meant to be shared. I would definitely recommend for anyone staying on the strip."}
{"text":"Suppose to be modern Italian but result a bit disappointing.  View of the fountain was great.  Service a bit better than average.  Pizza had a nice crust but sausage topping was too salty and overall not much taste.  Had the $38 brunch as well but was it too impressed."}
{"text":"The 1/2 off all drinks for their happy hour [until 8:00 PM] is a great deal [at the bar only!] . Mixed Drinks were normally 8-11 but for happy hour 1/2 off, well worth it. I had a 'honey, honey' - stoli, chambord, crushed [frozen] strawberries, and some honey, It wasn't sweet, which I liked. On a dead weekday night, our bartender did a great job taking care of us. The music, blur and gorillaz [someone loves damon albern, besides me], was there, noticeable [and perhaps slightly out of place] but still below conversation level. There's just one small tv off to the side at the bar. 

You can peek into the kitchen too, by sitting at the bar. Their beer selection was satisfactory, 5-6 different micros and Peroni [this is an Italian place, after all]. There's also wine as well. I split a pizza with some freinds [also half off at happy hour], about 8-10 pieces, with chunks of tomato, it was tasty.

I'm definitely adding it to my rotation of happy hours."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food bad service (waiter, not the Asian Female Sommelier)

Our waiter, Arturo, seemed more like someone that had just been promoted to the job of waiter from some other job.  No personality, engagement with customers, hard to understand, etc.  The food he recommended was not good. 

The Sommelier had much better selections than the waiter, so we tipper her directly at the end.  

Try Yellowtail.... much better."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great here. It was a little overpriced for the amount of food you get though. The only complaint I would have is how long it took for us to get our table even though we had reservations."}
{"text":"Expected so much more.  Everything was good, but for the location and price, I wanted great.  Honestly don't even remember what I ordered."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic yes, but the service is even better.  Our waitstaff was on point, they continually refilled our beverages before we could request, and offered great choices from their menu for us to try.

There hasn't been anything I've eaten here that I can't recommend, so go enjoy and feast on their fine menu selection.  Save room for dessert, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"We turned up at lago as a group of 4 with no reservation and were quickly seated (luckily enough with a view of the famous bellagio fountains) and informed that the menu was an Italian take on tapas and we were encouraged to order 3-4 dishes per person. This makes the meal slightly pricey, (as does the wine list) however the quality did not disappoint. It does make it difficult to share amongst friends as you really do only get a mouthful of each dish so I would recommend just ordering a few dishes individually. Standouts were the beef fillet, beef short rib cannelloni, the bruschetta (simple yet effective) and the seafood risotto. If you are chasing authentic Italian with large serves then this is not your place, but the modern tapas take on Italian food was executed superbly with the highlight being incredibly fresh produce. This kicked our night off at the bellagio perfectly."}
{"text":"Made reservations before flying into Las Vegas. The restaurant is in the Bellagio hotel on the Las Vegas strip. It has a window view of the beautiful water fountain outside of Bellagio. 
The positives:
Excellent very tasty food! My brother in law and his wife said their meal was very delicious. My husband had the grilled lamb chops and he said they were the best he's ever had: done perfectly and just melted in your mouth. I had the veal scallopini that was just amazing: it melted in your mouth with the best flavor! Our salads were excellent and fresh. My asparagus was nice and al dente. Our desserts were so fresh and delicious too! I had decaf coffee which didn't taste like decaf it was so good!
The negatives:
Very very loud. I should have checked yelp before booking! That is a complaint my brother in laws wife said she read on yelp. I avoid loud like the plague. We had to talk loud to communicate:(
Very modern decor: not my thing and not comfortable. 
Crowded tables. 

I suppose the small plates can be nice if you want to build your plate with what you prefer rather than what comes with the dinner. It was my first time and a little confusing as to how much I should order.  It worked out though. 

In short: loud, but tasty."}
{"text":"The view of the fountains during sunset and later in the evening are 5 stars. Make sure if your going to this restaurant you're going for the view, sit by the window tables. Otherwise, it's not worth it. 

Now this is why I'm eating it only 2 stars.

There is a lady that comes by your table to take photos of you. That is so touristy and cheesy. Makes dinner awkward and not as intimate. I mean we're just at dinner, do we really need to be this cheesy?! 

Second,

The food is garbage. The Cesar salad was tasteless. The bruschetta was the only okay thing we had ordered. But again just okay.
I ordered Pacherri de Telefono, baked pasta. Ummm.. did it ever come out! It was the smallest dish I had ever seen. It was like an appetizer for maybe 2 people. 

My hubby ordered Pappardelle Al Sugo Bugiardo. It was a sauce. There was 1 strand of think pasta in it and the rest of it was roasted veggies in tomato sauce. We make better pasta at home. 

I also ordered a cucumber mint drink that tasted awful. I took maybe 2 sips and left it hanging. 

Then, the bill. We skipped dessert because I'm sure it wasn't going to blow our minds. 

But... the bill! Was $95.00

For lame pasta and sauce- gross salad 

I can't believe how $$$ this place was for the quality and quantity of its food. 

I would watch the fountains outside for free. And eat someplace else."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in forever....service was incredible! I had veal and I'm looking forward to going back again....even the drinks are fabulous"}
{"text":"The food at lago is quite exquisite though their hostesses could use better training. We made a reservation for a group of four two days in advance and when we got there we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated though the place really wasn't full (we only stayed because we'd heard good things). We decided to order a bottle of wine while we waited for our table and what an ordeal that was! The hostess took us to the bartender who then said we needed to wait for the wine server, who just came out with an iPad full of wine selections that they actually didn't have on the premises but they will have at some point. Eventually we did find a bottle of Riesling after about 4 tries and then we were seated at our table. Everything was good, I'd like to give it another try when their service is together."}
{"text":"Perfection in all areas. Beautiful space, excellent service, fantastic food. Love the small plate concept, lots of different tastes, less likelihood of getting over stuffed. For two people we ordered Insalata Sarda (tomato and ricotta salad), Cesare (Caesar salad), Nduja (pork sausage, gorgonzola and tomato paste on crostini, do NOT miss this one!), Branzino Livornese (a delicate white fish with capers, olives and tomatoes), and the Filetto.  All were outstanding, as was the cappuccino, and hazelnut dessert. 

We purposely went early to avoid crowds and lessen the noise which was a good choice. Not a good choice was the family two tables over who brought their unhappy toddler to dinner with them. I love kids, but would NEVER intrude on the dining experience of my fellow patrons by bringing little ones to a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"You are kidding me. Based upon a website that rated this as the best restaurant in Bellagio, I took my family and wasted my time and money. The food is absolutely tasteless. The view is not worth the expense both in terms of time and money - you can watch the same view from a number of other locations. I always thought I would eat well at Vegas but now I am wary. This place should shut itself down and stop ripping off the don't-know-better tourists flocking to it."}
{"text":"Arrived a little late into town, so decided to order up Lago as the facade was appealing.  My $12 \"chopped salad\" which was supposed to have cucumber, cherry tomato and red onion, was served with three tiny pieces of fish.  Not only was this nowhere near the menu description, this meal that should have been meatless and take zero time to prep, somehow took a whopping 45 minutes.  This is one of the sorriest excuses for a restaurant that I've seen in some time.  Definitely will be avoiding any sort of repeat here."}
{"text":"Cinco de mayo...service was slow as expected on a busy night. I had the Buccatini and she had chicken. Both were incredibly underwhelming. I never complain about places.

The Buccatini is advertised as having lump crab meat. I got about one crab leg worth of cheap meat and shell in a small twirl of plain oil soaked pasta noodles. Like the tiniest crab leg on the knuckle too. Someone else rated this as an upscale olive garden. I'd consider the Olive Garden a step up in flavor. Did I mention it was super plain?

The chicken was at least a large portion. The small potatoes were the best thing on the plate. The skin was thin and crunchy. Underneath the meat was overcooked and somewhat dry. If you want chicken, I'd save yourself 20 dollars and get some KFC."}
{"text":"Very nice place, it's is not a super classy location, just nice and a good kitchen. The view is the best part. The only reason it gets 4 stars is when we were greeted by hostess we were told to follow her and don't forget to vacate the table in 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"Second day opening review--- Julian Serrano--- keep in mind with openings, the menu always changes. Concept is small tapas style to share but more Italian instead of Spanish 

Wow is what I can say about this restaurant. I will say it looks a little out of place in Bellagio (replaced Circo) because the decor is super modern contemporary inside and out. Their main pattern design is a overview of the streets of Milan and it has nice open space.  They offer indoor and outdoor seating(patio maybe 10 tables so limited) inside has floor to ceiling windows and they have private dining room and chefs table. 

On to the food. FYI the following food has a formal Italian name to which I do not know them haha. 

We had a little of everything. To drink try the cucumber mist cocktail. Very nice and refreshing. 

The must try entrees fare the short rib, red wine risotto, lobster gnocchi, and ahi tuna crudo. All of which are pretty self explanatory but so delicious. I liked the sauces of their plate and said Mmmmmmmm to these selections. 

I also had a cured meat flatbread, quail wrapped prosciutto, branzino, a spicy sausage bruschetta and a warm pastry with honey and cheese topping. 

For dessert try the lemon bar for a fruity choice or the hazelnut chocolate dessert for the chocolate choice. (FYI- we ordered all desserts except the flourless cake as they ran out) 

Since it is new we tried almost everything. I throughly enjoyed this place. Again keep in mind that what I had may not be available to you. My seat outside was in the most perfect location on the patio thanks to Albert and Brian our waiter did fantastic in asking appropriate questions to customize a menu for us. I look forward to doing this again."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it was packed. Even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait 20 minutes which sucked.

Once we were in, the magic began. The decor was really fancy and classy. It felt super up scale. Our server was great too. He was really attentive throughout our meal and was really helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.

We chose a bunch of different dishes and shared family style.

Highlights:
The Agnolotti. Wow. The insides were just so smooth. I really enjoyed this.

We tried the different pizzas. I like the salsicca the most. I didn't think I would like the pizza as much as I did but it was a good addition!

The bistecca was too cooked for my taste. It was medium :/ I didn't really like this. 

The sea bass was great. It tasted really fresh!

Overall, a really good place. I would love to come again!"}
{"text":"Read through a few reviews while looking for a nice place for a dinner date. Had more than a few chuckles at what people gave Lago bad reviews for. 

The 7&7 is an absolute delight of a dish. The potato gnocchi might as well have came from an Italian grandmother's own kitchen. The lobster was some of the best I've had, and with them all being knuckles, extremely consistent bites. The Spaghetti di fruti di mare is also another perfect option. People are complaining about price and size, yet you are getting lobster, scallop, shrimp, and clams, along with solid pasta, in one dish?

1. There is food on the menu that is there because it has to be. When you have a party of 15 and have a bodybuilder who insists that he only eat chicken and vegetables. Or for the loyal husband whose seafood-loving wife picked the place, but he only eats steak and burgers. They probably only have small pizzas on the menu because they're an Italian place. Get steak at a steakhouse. Get pizza at a pizza joint. Get seafood and pasta at Lago. Its not hard

2. Of course the wine is more expensive than your local grocery store. Sure, almost all restaurants will be somewhat overpriced for a glass, but here you get a sommelier you can call over at any time to help pair a wine with a dish, and being tapas style, there are many pairings. 

3. If you want to sit by the window like I did for the fountain, you have two logical options. Reserve for 5pm, and you'll be seated by the window because obviously, you'll be the first to be seated. Or, wait, because there are people who have to finish eating for you to take their seat. I don't see how you not sitting by the window means the restaurant sucks."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, don't go here. The food is bland. Fiancée states he had had more flavor in frozen taquitos and this reminded him of a TV dinner. There is a huge staff (overwhelming to be honest) that constantly refilled waters etc (which is nice) but the food was bland, VERY small (even for share plates). We are big foodies and this place we will NEVER return to. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great view of the fountain at Bellagio.  Our waiter was Italian, which is nice since it's an Italian restaurant.  Food was delicious, meat perfectly cooked!  Friendly staff too!  A wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the good reviews for dinner here. Heard rave reviews and went for an 8 pm dinner per many recommendations. 

Definitely a 'scene' and a beautiful view of the fountains. Ok for a cocktail. It's very very loud. 

The food is gross. Everything comes out super fast - I believe it's all prepared and sitting under a warmer. Most of the hot food came out cold. SUPER small portions with each small plate costing about $19. The pasta tastes like it came out of a can; I didn't eat a single thing I liked. For $300 we had wine and 5 very small plates. No kidding. 

Here is the thing - Vegas is home to world class dining. There are so many good choices... This just isn't one of them.  

I'm currently en route to get a pizza someplace else. Don't waste your money on this shitshow."}
{"text":"Tenia reservacion para el dia de hoy y cuando llegue me dijeron que mi mesa ya no estaba porque alguien reservo todo el lugar, era para varias personas las cuales vinieron en diferentes autos y ni siquiera disculpa nos pidieron, simplemente que alguien con mas dinero pago por mi mesa y punto, qdemas de tener que pagar 21 dolares por el valet parking por cada auto para nada, terrible lugar con un servicio de 1 estrella, me voy enojada espero que esto jobseblo hagan a nadie mas"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the drinks! Service sucked during the afternoon, very slow ... maybe dinner time is better???"}
{"text":"Great place for late night eats and lunch. We had mussels, meatballs, salad at 12am since our flight came in late. Service is prompt, friendly and accommodating. Also can back for lunch since we were staying at aloft and had to work from hotel room most of the day and picked up lunch. We're a little picky with no cheese and trying to be as gluten free as possible and they were very accommodating and made sure that we were aware of the ingredients in each dish. Service was again prompt and I felt like they went above and beyond to accommodate our preferences."}
{"text":"Restaurant has nice decor and vibe. Food is over priced (Tapas Style portions). We walked in to dine around 5:45 PM, place was empty. They asked if we were staying at the hotel or if you had reservations. If you say no to either, they sit you in the less desirable part of the restaurant. Food was average from my experience eating Italian in Italy. Caprese was the best thing we tried."}
{"text":"This place is great if you eat with your eyes.  Hit & miss with the taste of the food . Gorgeous view, cramped seating. Focacia was good, Campasanta (scallops) were overcooked, Brasato D'Antra was the best polenta I've ever had with good sized chunks of duck. For dessert I had the Giandujotto and it was beautiful! But unimpressive flavors/textures."}
{"text":"Best view in Vegas. Awesome food and service. Had a truly memorable time. Tried many things on the menu. All wonderful. Ask for patio seating if you can get it."}
{"text":"A cool slice of the Mediterranean in the middle of the strip. The restaurant is light and airy and gives the Grecian coast vibes. The food was fabulous. We were going for a light lunch and split the Lamb pasta. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the sauce was flavorful. The Lago cocktail was the star of the meal. The was complex and refreshing. I could have drank them all day in a cabana by the sea."}
{"text":"I usually do not write bad reviews but when you make my wife  upset  who was excited to make reservation  in person day before  you deserve one.  We arrived 30 min late after horrendous  traffic and they pretended like we didnt make reservation.  Said were not to be found  when my wife physically walked there the day before  to set a time.  She remembered and described all of the staff and all of a sudden they found our name.  I thought we would get a seat outside  and didnt mind a small wait since we were late also.   Then the manager ridicules the hostesses on how to seat which I found quite rude.  Hoping to get a seat they say sorry guys  u have to wait 2 hours.  I felt bad for my wife who all day was excited to show me this place LAGO.  Now I am pissed mess my night  up.....really.  I get her to sit inside  at table near bar and not be sad since last vegas visit till we have baby.    To make things worse this waiteress is super fast like a machine says just so you know all is a la carte and super small portions.  So pay a lot for very little...then front  hostess says your gonna eat here now after trying  to patch up situation.  Terrible service, snobby, rushed and just plain unacceptable  treatment  no matter how nice to look on the outside.   We got up and left this place quick as possible.  Had perfect dinner next door at 5 Star Olives who always treat us well.  Fix your service.....no surprise  the last month several bad reviews."}
{"text":"First time here wont be the last. Service. The food absolutely the best  can't wget air to come back"}
{"text":"The service is poor. The waitress took away my wine glass while I was looking at the wine list.  You have to ask to get you water refilled. The food quality is disappointing. The lamb chop was so tough I have carpal tunnel syndrome and jaw pain after I finished the meal. The quality does not match up with the price.  The other restaurants in Bellagio offer much better service and food."}
{"text":"Finally checked out the location on the East bank. Used to frequent the spot when it was in Tremont and it was always a good experience. We stopped here on the 4th, mainly bc the side of the city that it sits on was much less crowded than the other side with lines to get into everything. There were only a handful of people at Lago and I knew the food was good. We had a nice seat on the patio outside, which is dog friendly, ordered some beers we had not heard of which were tasty and tried a beet salad which was super delicious then ended with a Classico pizza. The pizza was basic with just mozzarella and basil, but it bursted with flavor, thin crust with just the right amount of burn on the edges. We devoured the whole eight slice pizza without a thought. We got there right as they were switching to the dinner menu, which was okay with the exception of the menu jumping from 10-15 dollar meals to 28 and up. Which would be fine for dinner, but we enjoyed the lunch prices and what we got for that price!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and surprised this place gets such high ratings, unless we went on an all-time-low day.  I made the reservation over a month in advance for 7:30 pm on 3/14, specifically requested patio seating and as it was my 50th birthday, I noted it in my reservation.  My sister and I arrived and settled in our hotel faster than expected, so we called Lago to see if we could move our reservations up a couple of hours, which they said was possible.  When we arrived, there were only 2 tables seated inside.  We were told there was only a table inside available, but it still had a view of the fountains, so that was fine, although we saw open tables on the patio.  Everything went downhill from there.  Our server, although there were only 4-5 people inside, was disinterested, almost to the point of annoyed.  We weren't told the specials and when a new table was seated behind us and told the specials by another server, we eventually asked ours what the specials were.  He said there was only one, which was a plain pasta dish with shaved truffles for $55 and that we probably wouldn't be interested.  Pass.  We started by ordering a few dishes, a glass of wine and a mixed drink.  Where to start...  The wine was a seriously small pour, but okay, it's a \"high end\" restaurant and that happens.  The mixed drink was 3/4 crushed ice, but tasted okay, but 3/4 crushed ice, which doesn't leave a lot of room for the actual drink (3-4 large sips for $19).  The food was terrible - period.  One item was the duck.  The description was not accurate and it came out as an overpowering muddy/stroganoff'ish mess atop polenta.  This combination did not go well together, as they were both strong flavors, which do not compliment each other at all.  Since the plates are so small, after we took a spoonful each, there wasn't much left in the original dish.  My sister and I were commenting to each other about the disappointing experience and turned to see the server and manager glaring at us and rolling their eyes from across the room.   The server came back and asked if everything was alright.  I stated the duck was not good, and he was not happy.  He took the plate and again, we watched the rolling eyes from across the room.  Since the small amount of food we ordered wasn't good, we decided to just get a desert and end it.  Big mistake.  We ordered the crème brulee because I love all things crème brulee and have never passed one up, ever... until this time.  It came out as an almost solid clump of butter with still crystalized sugar, which sounds delicious, but it was not.  During our meal, another couple arrived and was seated next to us.  This was the only positive experience from all this.  They were a very sweet couple and asked if what we were eating was good because it \"didn't look right\".  They said they had eaten there on a few other occasions and this time was not the same.  When the server finally came back, we said the brulee wasn't right, and the couple seated next to us concurred.  He said, \"so you don't want it then?\", looked flustered and took it away.  Again, rolling eyes from across the room.  He came back after some time and said, \"the manager agreed to take the desert off your bill\", like it was a favor.  We had taken 2 bites, so it's not like we were eating everything and then wanting it for free.  No happy birthday... nothing but attitude.  When we were leaving, the manager just stared at us from the hostess podium, so I felt compelled to say what a terrible experience it was.  He actually looked annoyed, but did say sorry - definitely not convincing though.  Thanks for making my 50th birthday celebration dinner so awesome.  I had been looking forward to it for months."}
{"text":"Great service. Waiter couldn't be a nicer guy. Small plates for our late dinner snack after a show. Stay away from the meatballs. Everything else we had was very good. With a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountain."}
{"text":"To be blunt, I'm not impressed.  My husband and I joined my former in-laws for their 34th anniversary dinner, as they were looking forward to eating here since January.  I absolutely hate to leave bad reviews, but we were very disappointed, and I know this was not how they envisioned our dinner with them.  Far too much visual stimulation in the decor, lousy service, zero ambiance, and sub-par food for the price.  I get the \"Italian Tapas\" concept, but it just doesn't work in that environment.  What an epic let down, given how amazing both Picasso and Julian Serrano Tapas are.  I totally agree with the previous review that it's not worth the hype..."}
{"text":"We came for a quick lunch on a weekday at around 11:30 am when the restaurant opened, and we were gladly seated on the porch overlooking the Bellagio fountain, next to the Eiffel tower replica. The location was super nice, and it felt as if I was transported to France. Also, the porch had heaters, which kept us warm. 

I ordered the octopus soup off of the lunch menu and it was pretty good! I liked the rich tomato based soup with chickpeas, and the octopus was super tender. The garlic bread crisps that came with the soup paired well, and the portion was just enough for a light lunch. My mom ordered the lobster spaghetti special and she liked it a lot, and my brother ordered a lamb ragu pasta. The pasta portions were honestly pretty big, despite the waitresses recommendation of each person ordering two items. 

Overall, a good and quick option for lunch. A great location and amazing, simple Italian food!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside the Bellagio hotel, next to Hype club. We got the good spot to look out with the good foods. The portion of the food were just right for us & pretty filled up. I got the cocktail which is good but it was later hit me really bad which the strong alcohol inside"}
{"text":"Ate here over 4th of July weekend. I just glanced at the menu beforehand, and considering you can overlook the Bellagio Fountains, the prices really were not bad at all. I think my pasta entrée was $15.00, and the serving size was decent, I couldn't even finish all of it, I had to get a to-go box. The pasta tasted homemade, as did the amazing pesto sauce. I am going back in a few months when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"The terrace has an unforgettable view of the Bellagio lakeside.  Food was delicious and cocktails were even better.  I had the shrimp ravioli and garlic bread, both of which were delicious.  I went for lunch and I went with a vegetarian and was a bit disappointed by the vegetarian selection, especially since Julian Serrano's other Vegas restaurants have such great vegetarian options.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Started with a couple tasty cucumber cocktails at the bar, then headed to our table on the well warmed patio overlooking the fountains. Food was fantastic, beginning with the beef carpaccio and stuffed squid.

I had veal scallopine with a perfectly sized side of pasta luxuriously drenched in a buttery lemon sauce.

Ended a great meal with tangy citrus panna cotta. Server was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We started of with the polenta and bruschetta. Great!
We continued with the risotto, salmon and the pesto fettuccini. Awesome! 

Great restaurant, nice  ambiance and delicious desert. 

All that comes with a high price tag."}
{"text":"Views of fountains are beautiful but don't go for the food! Have a drink and a small bite to justify getting a table but don't spend the money! I love Julian Serrano's original but the food at Lago is mediocre. Pasta was more than al dente and the burrata while fresh was topped with a  bland tomato dressing  and the bread too heavy. Everything tasted the same. Disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"delightful place for lunch.  ya got to be there 
very modern
view view and more beautiful view at all Bellagio restaurants"}
{"text":"We ate lunch at Lago on Saturday, and then returned for dinner on Monday -- so that says something.  Both experiences were much the same.  It is a joy to eat at Lago, with stunning views of the fountains, and a clean, open, modern decor which emphasises shapes and spaces.

If only the food were exceptional instead of competent (for the most part).

The basic concept at Lago is small plates, but they are really not so small, and two of them will satisfy the average appetite, with maybe a bit of room for one of their truly yummy desserts.  In fact, a Lago small plate is what restaurants used to call \"a meal\" before the ridiculous size expansion of the last ten years.  If you are not hungry, two per person may be too much.

All of the nine dishes we ordered were good, and we cleaned eight of our plates.  Only the pasta was left unfinished, and this because it gets very starchy when it cools.  But there is not one of them I can recommend as being exceptional but for the Bronzino, where the accompanying relish superbly compliments the fish.

Like all Bellagio restaurants, Lago is expensive, but not ridiculously so (except for wine), so you can probably afford it if you don't have a really bad day at the tables.

Bon appetite."}
{"text":"I've been excited to try this new restaurant in the Bellagio with a killer front and center view of the watershow. I loved the crisp, modern feel of the restaurant design and color scheme. I love the small plate concept for high end italian. We were able to try several great dishes as a group. 

I started with the tonno (ahi tuna with orange segments) and a caesar salad. Both were good, not amazing, but good. My friends had the Alla ricotta e miele (ricotta cheese with honey) per recommendation, and really like that quite a bit. 

We all got various homemade pastas for our entrees. Now these were fantastic. The highlight of the night though, was the pasta special which was a long thick noodle pasta with truffle oil, and then black shaved truffles over the top. It was LOADED with truffles, and the dish was out of this world! So was the price:-) but that was to be expected. I will go back just for this dish!

We shared desserts, which were as good as they were beautiful. A great way to end a lovely meal and view."}
{"text":"This review is for their BRUNCH! We went on a Saturday for brunch and it was great! It's a pre fixed menu for around $40 something dollars that includes three entrees. My Fiance and I had the Carbonara Mac & Cheese (delicious!), the florentine chicken (AMAZING!), the polenta and duck (BEST POLENTA ever!!!) and MY FAVORITE the eggplant parmesan egg benedict! 

The food was top notch and really tasty. We ended brunch with an amazing dessert bar but by then we were too full. We also had two drinks that were beautiful but also really good. The restaurant decor is great too and I felt like I was having brunch at a high end Beverly Hills establishment. We could see the fountains and the strip from our table. Our waiter was really nice and I though that the ipad with the drink menu was clever. 

This is by far the BEST brunch deal on the Strip! I will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Lago was just okay for me. The food is SO mediocre compared to many other Italian restaurants.  I think \"fine dining\" Italian is just so hard to do.  The \"small plates\" thing just didn't work for us. I felt that the food was grossly overpriced for what we were getting. I don't mind paying a lot for food, if the food is good and worth it, and in this case, I just really didn't think it was. 

We ordered the margherita pizza, which was a simple cheese pizza fit for a 5 year old.  We also ordered the 7&7 gnocchi with lobster, the mallorados, filet, bruschetta, and the ravioli al gamberi.  All were good, and nothing was exceptional.  My favorite was the mallorados, even though someone else at the table said it tasted like hamburger helper. :/

Another thing I didn't like was the interior of the restaurant. The decor seemed tacky and overdone.  The tables were literally 6 \" away from each other so it felt like you were eating at your neighbor's table. Very awkward for conversations.

Overall I would not go back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great spot view of the lake and food is terrific.  Staff is trying hard so get there quick its an excellent place."}
{"text":"Very good service. The waiter informed us that the portion is big but it is it was as any normal restaurant portion. The taste was ok."}
{"text":"Probably the best food I've had at Bellagio. Lagos serves Italian influenced tapas in a beautiful space boasting prime views of the fountain. 

I was here with a supplier so I couldn't take any photos but know that everything will be plated beautifully. We chose to let the waiter decide a menu for us and everything I had was at least \"good\" and many things were absolutely amazing. 

Personal favorites - pasta with lamb ragu, shirt rib filled ravioli (so, so good), a beautiful charcuterie plate and fresh burrata served with heirloom tomatoes. Expect hefty prices - most plates are $20ish and they recommend 3 per person. The wine list is both expensive and extensive with most glasses in the upper teens on the low end. 

Service was good, considering they were absolutely slammed with huge parties AND backed up on reservations. I'm glad I got to eat here and even more glad I didn't have to pick up the tab!"}
{"text":"Awful experience here. My husband and I had a dinner reservation for 8:15 PM on a Thursday night.We sat at the bar and waited for our table. We were waiting for over an hour. We noticed that people kept getting seated ahead of us. The staff was rude, and they were basically ignoring us. We ended up leaving. Maybe it's because we didn't order drinks at the bar, and they thought we wouldn't be spending much money. I left upset and hungry."}
{"text":"Not bad. Stayed in a hotel nearby and wandered in. Nice crowd and good service. Nice to have something to do in this area of the warehouse district/flats."}
{"text":"Expensive for no reason. Don't waste your money. The food was mediocre, at best. 2 stars for the view."}
{"text":"Where to start? Oh, I know how to... THE VIEW, you are sitting right in front of the famous bellagio fountains (ask for outdoors or window sitting) and for the price of a meal you enjoy the best view of the fountains. Now... when we come we like to sit at the bar and Osvel always remembers us and what we like to order and that's what I call 5 star service. What's better than that? Julian Serrano himself approving a menu change for lunch and giving you the best branzino ever that's only available for the dinner menu. Thank you for the amazing hospitality, gorgeous views and world class food."}
{"text":"This place is your typical tourist trap.  You pay big dollars for small amount of food.  It would be justifiable if the flavors are worth it, but sadly it's not.  I would skip this one.  I suggest going off the strip."}
{"text":"Very good quality food with a bright atmosphere. I eat here a little after the lunch rush so no waiting for a seat. The staff was very nice and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends gathered in Las Vegas and we stopped at Lagos for a quick before dinner cocktail.  Our server was clueless when one person ordered a Sangria, two trips later she confirmed it could be made.  Five drinks @ a total cost of $105 is ridiculous!  I now understand why there was no wait.  The menu was limited and not appealing to our group overall."}
{"text":"I'm systematically going through all the top Italian restaurants on the Strip, in search for the best Italian and best pasta. 

Lago was decent, better than Spago, but I prefer the pasta at Scarpetta and Lavo. 

The service was great, the drinks were mediocre, the ambiance and views were beautiful but it was so loud and impossible to have a conversation in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great table on the patio overlooking the fountains. Thankfully, there's a limited number of tables out there, so not super crowded nor loud. Our server, Frank, was friendly with personality. The braised duck was fantastic! We'll be back for special occasions and take our friends and family here!"}
{"text":"5 star food.  3 star service.  4 star environment.

The Food:
- The chilled tomato soup was very nice.  Rich, smooth, and a little tangy.  The burrata took it up several notches.  Excellent
- The caprese salad was perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes were just the right amount of ripe
- The cheese platter had a nice mix of cheeses that were at just the right temperature.  Smooth, nutty, and strong
- My osso bucco was incredible.  So tender.  Large portion of bone marrow.  Mixed with a light red wine sauce and crushed polenta.  Oh my.  The best osso bucco I've ever had

The Service:
- We were a group of seven and the cutoff for the automatic 20% tip is 8, so I think our server was a little upset thinking we were going to short her on the tip (I didn't, even though I should have)
- She was relatively inattentive and had a few eye rolls.  Not sure why
- The maitre d' made up up for some of her inattention

The Environment:
- Spectacular views of the fountain
- Way too loud.  Over the top loud.  No need to play dance music when the fountain show isn't happening.  The loud music made everyone speak louder, which made the overall volume of the restaurant borderline intolerable"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service, with a great view!

I should have written this when I still remembered the bartender's and our server's names, and what dishes were my favorites. Instead, I simply have to say that I had wanted to try Lago for quite some time, and I was very happy that I finally did.

The caveat, as always, with Lago and other great restaurants on the Strip is that you pay a premium for occupying valuable real estate, even if it's only for an hour or two. The delicious $16 cocktails add up even faster than some of the tasty tapas."}
{"text":"Beautiful way to have an amazing meal and see the fountain show!! The lamb chops are amazing and the dessert menu is a sure pleaser! This was hands down one of the best meals I've had on the strip. Reasonably priced and service is on point!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were walking through the Bellagio on a Monday night.  We were getting hungry, but hadn't given any thought toward dinner plans.   We spied Lago as we were walking through the casino and made the decision to give it a go.  We didn't have reservations (not that we likely needed it on a Monday night around 9pm), but were able to be seated immediately.  Seats were also available at the bar and it offered full menu service, so we opted instead to sit at the bar.

We started off with cocktails while we looked over the menu.  I had the Rose and Rye ($16) made with Bulleit Rye, Carpano Antica, Aperol, lemon juice, rose petal syrup, and garnished with smoked maraschino cherries.  It was everything that I look for in a drink, boozy, bitter with a touch of sweetness.  Lago is a small plates restaurant specializing in Italian fare.  Being all too familiar with the small plates/tapas concept, we picked several items to share.  We had the Risotto alla Trippa E Funghi or tripe risotto with mushrooms ($17), Polpo E Fregola al Nero or grilled octopus over squid ink \"cous cous\" ($17), and Malloreddos ($14), a small Sardinian pasta that resembles gnocchetti with pork sausage and tomato sauce.  I can't say that I liked one dish over the others since they were all excellent, each in its own way.  I recommend them all!  Lago was a bit pricier than most tapas joints that we've been, but I felt that portion sizes were fair, the food was quite delicious, and I know that I left satisfied."}
{"text":"My family and I had pleasure meeting Monique. She was nice, very helpful and super kind. Great service, food came exactly how we ordered and beautiful place. Beautiful place to visit while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Pretty slow night and we waited fifteen minutes at the bar for a drink while the bartenders were talking with one another. Once we did get served the bartender was incredibly rude. I will never come back."}
{"text":"We made reservations over a month in advance for 13 of us to eat at Lago. They called us to confirm several times. We called a couple of weeks in advance to request a table with a view. They advised us that we should show up early in order to get a table with a view. We showed up half an hour early. We still had not been sat half an hour AFTER our reservation. I had to raise hell in order to get sat. We did not get a table anywhere close to the view. Everything took so long that we ended up missing our after-dinner plans. I was with good company, but regret making our celebratory dinner at Lago. They acted like we should be begging them to give them our money for an over-priced meal and a pretentious atmosphere. No thank you."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was just as good. All the servers were polite and extremely helpful. I ordered a bone in steak that was perfect! Not cheap, but for the food, service and view of the fountains - well worth it!"}
{"text":"It is a unique dining experience. I came for brunch on Sunday it wasn't packed and service was great. I was starving the waiter came and took our drink order and I went to the desert bar and got a couple things. It was a 3 course brunch the first thing I got was Mac Carbonara it was delicious. I also got lasagna. The food is delicious you have to have an open mind when coming to here."}
{"text":"I attempted to dine here last night. I was staying at the Aloft Hotel that's attached the the Restuarant.  When I walked in, I was greeted with a smile and sat by the hostess. I had just landed and was looking for some good food. 

5 minutes into my visit,  I looked at the menu and made eye contact with who I assumed was my waiter. He barely acknowledged me and told me he would be with me shortly. About 5 minutes later I received my water from a bar back and was told the waiter would be with me shortly. The table next to me ordered exactly what I had been looking at on the menu (the salmon)--this confirmed what I knew I wanted. I was more than ready to order. 5 minutes  more had past (a total of 15 minutes) and still no services beyond water. Needless to say I was irritated. Keep in mind that the restaurant was less than 50% capacity. At this point I decided that Lago was never going to get any of my money and I walked out right passed the server, who instead of stopping me--did a 180 and walked the other way. Step your service game up Lago. I spend tons of money at restaurants, but I'll never spend a dollar here!m"}
{"text":"I took my fiance here for dinner and the food was amazing! We ordered various items from the menu and ended with dessert. One of the highlights was the view of the Bellagio fountains...he absolutely loved it. The only thing is I had requested they bring out a dessert to surprise him since it was his birthday and they didn't do that...it would have been nice. Other than that it was a memorable evening."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant because of all the reviews, and the fact that the Bellagio is our favorite. We ordered two drinks, an appetizer, and a pizza. The entire experience was soured by being treated poorly by the wait staff right off the bat. We were ignored throughout the meal, and it took us 15 minutes to get our check. Once we had the check, it then took our bartender/waiter 25 minutes to process the payment because there was some sort of computer issue. Let me note that there was one other couple in the restaurant at the time. Right next to us, that other couple was getting copious amounts of attention/service the entire time. Due to the judgmental staff and non memorable food, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision as we were going to O after and needed to eat at bellagio. I would definitely not go again.

The food was not bad, but nothing exceptional. It's expensive and tapas, so small portions. 

The restaurant does not have near the amount of wait staff that they need. I don't think our server was bad, but she was so busy she took 20 minutes to bring us the check, after we asked for it. 

Definitely better places on the strip, though you need to do your research!"}
{"text":"Summary: Favorite restaurant by far on the strip for a special evening 
1) Reservation: Preferable, especially for dinner and if you would like a seat on the outside patio or by the wall to ceiling windows to get a better view of the Bellagio fountains 
2) Ambiance: TOP NOTCH, very clean white and blue color theme with these amazing wall to ceiling windows so that people sitting in that area have a fantastic view of the fountain show
3) Service: Impeccable, our service was quick and very respectful/helpful
4) Food: AMAZING, highly recommend the risotto and the polenta as well as their chocolate dessert. Food was very clean and light with robust flavors."}
{"text":"Great view and great service. Food is mediocre. Nothing impressed us. We had red wine burrata(C) filet(C) speck mini pizza(B-) pasta/sausage/ricotta(B+) foccicia bread with honey and ricotta(A) 7&7(A-)"}
{"text":"Came to visit my wife for lunch at the Bellagio. 
We were looking for a cafe. Well this is nothing like a cafe. 
It's like a fine dining but for lunch. 
The service was very impressive. Staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable of their menu. 
We started with the pizza which is fired stone cooked. I think. I don't know but the crust , It's perfectly crisp. 
We also tried the Ceasar salad add salmon to it. 
Very nicely dressed light and filling. 
The fruit de mare pasta was a little too spicy for me but I finished it. Just had to drink a lot of water. (Lol) 
My wife had the stuffed lobster ravioli. I didn't get to try it but I will next time. Will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Julian Serrano does it again this time with a trendy Italian dining hotspot.  

Set in a stunning modern Italian dining space with views of the fountains of Bellagio, Lago delivers a great social dining experience centered around sharing plates and evoking conversation. 

Tip:  On menu small plate portions are sensible and designed for two to three.  Ask the servers as many items can be ordered individually to adjust for the number at the table.  Hold a menu and order in flights.  Dishes will always be served at the right temperature and there is no chance of overdoing it.  

In general, the food is simple, emphasizing a single element and supporting it with the addition of ingredients.  This is six sense dining with many dishes emphasizing umame.

SUCKLING PIG!  Order it when you first make your reservation or hope to get very lucky.  This off the menu item is a Serrano specialty.  Whole (about 8 pounds, half, or a quarter), golden brown, uber crisp skin surrounds sweet, fall off the bone tender, juicy, porky goodness.  Rosemary perfumes the air and tints every bite.  A singlular experience so good it can bring tears to your eyes.

The polpo e fregola al nero (tender grilled octopus legs with squid ink imbued Sardinian couscous and shaved botarga) is stunning.  Herbaceous basil, zesty lemon and peppery olive oil elevate the dish providing welcome brightness while the botarga, umame complexity.  The squid ink cous cous adds a creamy, oceanic finish to the dish that works exceptionally well when paired with the octopus.

7&7 (gnochi with lobster claw in a tomato based sauce reminiscent of a lobster bisque.  Gnochi is fluffy on the inside and pan seared crispness on the outside for great textural foil for the sweet, tender lobster knuckles.

Not to be missed, the quail Saltimbocca (boneless braised sage flavored quail wrapped in prosciutto served in its own jus).  Oh so tender, just the right of salinity, the prosciutto heightens the gaminess of the quail perfectly.  Screams autumn.

The risotto alla trippa e funghi (risotto of tripe, mushrooms, and mint).  A loose tomato based risotto hitting on all levels.  Mushrooms heighten the umame overtones when combined with the tripe's funkiness while the acidic tomato sauce provides balance.  Creamy, warm, and delicious

Finally, the vitello tonnato (chilled thinly sliced, par cooked veal loin with a tuna, caper dressing) is just good eats.  Keep thinking People Eating Tasty Animals and you're OK.  Mildly beefy, texture so soft almost like sweetbreads.  It's flavors becoming more pronounced thanks to the briny, salty capers.  Ahhhh.  

Service is outstanding however could do without the Italian fashion world attitude (Italian dining should be jovial, not standoffish).

Very impressive signature cocktail list.  Definitely try one before dinner.  Creative, sophisticated and yummy!  Very good, wine list.  Look to non typical regions for the best value and most intriguing selections (Aged German pinot noir, Spanish grand reserva Rijoa).  Vegas resort pricing.

Yet another home run.  Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I was debating between 4 or 5 stars. 

Food was delicious! The medallion fillets was divine! Polenta was great! We loved the tomato bruschetta and everything else was good. 

Service was ok. Just ok. Not outstanding. We made a reservation and it took some time to be seated. Our server seemed a little preoccupied and we felt a little rushed. But he came around and the food and drinks came out on time. 

Overall we loved this place and can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"They have the Most Amazing Food and the Most Amazing  Atmosphere  there my Husband  and  I  spends all of our Anniversary's there, we would not go anywhere  else! The staff treat you like you so well."}
{"text":"Not great. I had way better food that had 4 stars. Not very impressed. The food was warm not even hot. Not much flavors or spices. A little bit disappointed. The cocktail was not great either."}
{"text":"I went to Lago's brunch last week. My wife and I had a wonderful time. Such a great view of the fountains. I didn't really know how this \"tapas\" works. Monique (server) were super patient and helpful, she gave us some really good recommendations. We tried the Antipasto Misto, Lasagna and Pizzeta. We love it !!! She totally made the difference with her attitude and excellent costumer service. Awesome experience, looking forward to come back again and try something new."}
{"text":"SERVICE ZERO!!!
I think the restaurant needs an experienced mgmt team. The service is very young and attractive but just inexperienced.
We were served our salad, when our entree was served the wait team expected me to remove the empty plate. Pepper was not offered when we were served our salad and our wait team just never came by to check on us.
I ordered Osso Buco that was very fatty (see pic), a soup that was bland. I may have just gotten the inexperienced staff on a bad day.

There are much better options out at Bellagio.
Will never return or recommend. PASS on this one."}
{"text":"Lago was supposed to be our one \"nice\" dinner before heading out to party the night away during our girls weekend in Vegas. 
The view of the fountains while you dine is unmatched. The food had some great flavors and came out quickly.... And that's about all I can say about what I liked.

The service was ok-ish. I didn't really think it was appropriate to have our server open up our paid bills at the end of the meal and check on his gratuities at the table as we sat there. 

As I said the food had some great flavors. Jackie B and I ordered 4 dishes to share. The branzino was done very very well. The funghi was also very good. I was excited for the seafood risotto but was left very underwhelmed. Not enough seafood/lobster to be called a seafood/lobster risotto. It also lacked that creaminess you expect in a risotto. So definitely not even close to being worth the price tag. We then ordered a Cesar salad at the end of our meal because after sharing 3 dishes we were still hungry. Quite possibly one of the worst tasting and unappealing salads i've had. The dressing was awful, the portion size literally looked as if the chef took apart a head of lettuce and found the 5 smallest leaves he could find and put them on the plate, and whole anchovies staring at me made my stomach turn. We immediately sent it back.
The rest of our group is also sorely disappointed not with the flavor of their meals but with size of their dishes especially since this was considered our \"splurge meal\". 

Unfortunately Lago is not a place to come to with an appetite or a place to come to when you expect to get a decent sized portion for the price of each dish. Sadly I won't return. With so many other amazing restaurants in Vegas, this is one you can skip."}
{"text":"The service at brunch yesterday was the WORST. The waitress was totally unattentive - did not take away dirty dishes, refill water, or refill ice tea. She was too busy flirting with a table of men.  We had to beg her for the check. The table was on the patio in a corner behind the door with no view and no ambience. There should not have been a table there. When we asked to change tables, the manager said that \"hotel guests\" were going to sit there. The food was good - not great. I would have preferred going to Pink's Hotdogs. I would not recommend this restaurant, and am surprised that Julian Serrano would have such incompetent staff. If I were he, I would be ashamed."}
{"text":"Well I was really looking forward to dining here. Always try to go to a new 'splurge' place each time I come to Vegas and I hadn't been to Lago yet. I'm glad I went so I can check it off my list. I won't be back. I have it 2 starts because it's a beautiful restaurant and has big picture windows that overlook the fountains. Good: they did honor our reservation and even took us a few minutes early. The appetizer we order of chicken liver on crustini (sp?) was delicious! Just ok: The food was ok. Not up to the standard of a named Chef, I thought. I ordered the risotto w Lobster, shrimp and scallops (also comes w clam, which I asked them to leave off and they did.) The risotto tasted like rice I thought and for $33, I wanted risotto, not rice. My friends meals were very small and did not come with any sides. Weren't even offered as a buying option. They do make them and they come with what they call 'The main entree' or 'The entrees' don't really recall. Which was fine but no choices I was interested in. No apparent option to order a veggie or potato to add to your meal. So after our $200ish meal, 3 ppl, 2 glasses of wine, my friend was going to have to find somewhere else to get some more food. My friends meals were good but not so good that we would come back for it again. Bad: our server, though very nice, barely came by the table. If I'm splurging on an expensive restaurant, which I don't mind doing while in Vegas, I want a server who knows their food is overpriced/expensive and appreciates that I'm there to spend my money at her place of business. We saw the water refill guy way more often. Also, I thought the wines were overpriced and my Cab was just ok. And ok  I get $20 for a glass but they offer a half bottle (2glasses) for $52. Um, really? If I wanted more then I'd have to buy a full bottle to make it worthwhile but I can't drink a full bottle of wine at one sitting and still eat my meal or walk out under my own steam. Just sayin! I won't be recommending Lago to anyone."}
{"text":"This was underwhelming considering the price.  Drinks were jacked up prices and weren't going to blow me away.  We had Caesar salad and burata first and these were good.  Dinner was 7 and 7 as well as canneloni.  This isn't going to fill you up and it's really expensive.  I like Julian's tapas at Aria, but for me, this isn't worth the high prices given the merely ok flavor of the dishes we had."}
{"text":"Best Brunch I've had in a long time!!!

I came here with all my ladies for my birthday. Since we're all at different phases in my life and I'm a social butterfly I figured a Sunday morning brunch would be suitable for us all to celebrate. Initially we were going to be seated on their beautiful balcony however it began to rain. We still had a killer view inside. I mean, justlcome here for the view. I decided on this spot for the view. The cherry on top was the water show front row seating we had every 15 minutes. We had a family style pastry basket brought to our table upon being seated. Everyone at the table raved about the various pastries they had. Now for the best part, the restaurant had customized the menus to read HAPPY 25th BIRTHDAY SHAHIRA!!! A menu at another table had the same header! How thoughtful is that and the hospitality is mind blowing. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AT LAGO! 
We each were able to select our own course 1 & 2. I got the the Shredded Salmon Salad and the Filettino. Both were very delicious! The dessert bar was self serve and they had: a chocolate fountain with marshmallows, strawberries, brownies, Rice Krispies. They had tiramisu, Nutella Crepe, Panettone Pudding & Fruit Salad (my favorite; so fresh).  In addition, the service was great! They serve bottomless Sunday drinks for an additional $28.00 and they have a wide range of options from mimosas to bellinis to bloody Mary's with full range of juices. The gourmet food decor was nothing short of excellent! 

I can't wait to return at a later date for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Bland, over-priced. Just truly awful. We took one bite, called the manager over, sent everything back and went to another restaurant. I have no idea why this place gets so many good reviews; my guess is that folks will give anything five stars if it involves \"bottomless\" drinks. Stay far, far away."}
{"text":"Had 8pm reservation for 2ppl on a very HOT Thursday in July and I wasnt sure if I wanted to outside but the host was nice enough to show me the outside table up front and center looking at the Bellagio fountain with misters all above us... ummm, yeah, I'll take that table.
our waiter was magnificent.  he was always checking on us, recommending dishes, and even became our photographer.  a perfect table on a very nice dinner with a magical view of the fountain.  For a bit, I forgot there were other tables around us.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food is what LAGO must mean! I had the best gnocchi of my life at LAGO! DEFINITE MUST TRY. The restaurant is in a great location to see the fountains, it's a great view with awesome food. The shared plates style give you and everyone a chance to try just a little more than you normally can. Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Tapas meets italian food. Small tasty dishes populate your table as your order 2+ dishes for number of diners

Yes it's expensive. It's vegas, it's priced through da nose.   Forget that part, else surge on the BMI+ buffet.  Must food really be a value per calorie (or spoonful)? 'I ate this much for only 20$'.   
Dishes are smaller at Lago, but satisfying.

And, they brought out an unexpected sampler of desserts for a birthday, with a chocolate inscription. Right to a diners heart"}
{"text":"Lago restaurant has the most amazing view I ever had for dinner. We had reservations for 8 pm and we didn't get seated until 8.30 but you know what? No problem, I totally understand people not wanting to leave the patio. We got to enjoy some drinks from the menu. The drinks are very exotic and unique. The margarita for example uses volcanic salt from Hawaii . The mojito has passion fruit seeds and its delicious. My favorite was the LAGO cocktail. A vodka drink with a really cute flower inside an ice cube. The staff at the bar were friendly. They were very busy but always made sure my party and I had drinks. 
The ambiance at this restaurant is contemporary. My favorite place to seat was obviously the patio. We got to enjoy the Bellagio Fountain Shows every 15 minutes and we were almost in front of the Eiffel Tower replica, which made the view more amazing. 
The food concept was great, it was small tapas. I had the short ribs and Frutti di Mari risotto. The ribs were cold but Bryan, our server, was diligent and changed the ribs for warmer ones. He took them out of the bill which was nice. My seafood risotto was tasty and satisfying. In my table, my party got the lamb shanks with fingerling potatoes and they were amazing. Probably I'll get that next time. 
I also had a bite of the fish and it was delicious
I could not leave an Italian restaurant without trying their delicious tiramisu. It was small, different from others but really good.
Overall wonderful experience, drinks a little pricey but exotic, the food was not ridiculously overpriced for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very  romantic ! Great Italian restaurant!
Best view of the Bellagio fountain ! what else you can ask for ? +  good food"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Every single dish was delicious Also great value for the money!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this restaurant. I am confused at its rating on here...if this isn't five stars, then what is??? The food was so perfect, that's the best way I can describe it. Amazing ingredients and execution, so so delicious, light and clean tasting, and it literally made me feel like I was dining in the Mediterranean. Drinks were fantastic and perfectly balanced, and service was superb. And can't beat sitting by the Bellagio fountains. The fountains were being cleaned when we were there, but the water still had such a calming effect. Just beautiful. Can't wait to come back and I'm sad this wonderful lunch is over. It'll definitely be one I remember.

Wagyu carpaccio: so good. A little thicker cut than regular carpaccio, which is nice because the beef is so exceptional. Fresh, crisp, sharp arugula to bring out the flavors and literally the best Parmesan reggiano I have ever tasted. Topped with a drizzle of lemon sauce that perfected the whole thing.

Scallop crudo: the best scallop dish I've ever had. Ever. Delicate, fresh, perfect combination of flavors, and left a taste in my mouth that I didn't want to go away.

Rigatoni with lamb ragu: perfectly cooked pasta, delicious and not as heavy as you would expect a lamb ragu to be.

Branzino: skin could've been a LITTLE crisper but it was so so good anyway. Authentically Mediterranean.

Veal piccata: amazing. Just amazing. We literally were scraping the leftover sauce off the bottom of the plate at the end. Maybe the best veal piccata I've had too. Probably is.

Cannoli: SOOOOOOO GOOOD!!! I want more!!!

Amalfi dessert: also really yummy. The merengue was perfectly prepared and the flavored were lemony and amazing. Definitely recommend.

Try this place. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Went in Late December on a business trip and got to meet the famous Julian Serrano. I promised him a great review and I never got to it. I got to try his amazing dishes that included the Osso Busco and Garganelli. We were a last minute reservation that were fortunate to get a deck seating. We loved every moment of the experience. The most rewarding meal for my expanding gut was the Osso Busco! Best Veal Shank my mouth has tasted. 
Early May, the same group decided on a road trip and we took a pit stop for the Bellagio fountains and to top off our lingering cravings of Pesce al cartoccio and the Pesce intero. Amazing dishes, but I am still a great fan of the Osso Busco! Got to love the Lago experience at the Bellagio. Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Service for 12 of us was pretty good, very accommodating and pretty quick considering the number of us. It can get a little loud in here towards the back and in general, but its very modern and looks great. 

The cocktails - unfortunately these came out not as advertised on their Ipad menus. Drinks didn't look quite the same and were missing garnishes in a couple different ones.

As for the food, tapas size, good for around 2-3 people per dish on average for a decent taste. The Burrata was excellent, The ricotta and honey crostini was also pretty solid. Decent salumi platter with some quality prosciutto. The canneloni and the veal agnolotti were pretty good picks. The red wine risotto had strong wine flavor and looked dark and rich- fairly unique flavor profile.  Overall the food here is pretty good, definitely a must repeat because of the variety.
Solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Very happy with the service,  food was very good short ribs tender,  minestrone good  (Maybe more seasoning) only complaint was antipasto olives weren't on par with the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Great place for a brunch! 
It has one of the best views of the strip. The service was great and the menu really well planned
I had from the Sunday menu the Raviolone and for the main course the Filletino which it was cooked to perfection. 
The only thing I would improve will be the patio. It is such an incredible view so I believe that a little remodel of the outside will give the customers the perfect experience (the tables, floors and chair where old)"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for a little get away/semi romantic dinner.  The food is solid, but be aware that these are SMALL plate tapas style.  Probably the only disappointing thing was our view.  My wife loves coming to see the Bellagio fountains (what woman doesn't) so much so we have to view them multiple times and angles each trip we make. It makes her happy though so I'm all for it.  Back to the review.  Make sure you get a seat right at the window.  If you don't, you won't have a good view of the fountains. All in all cool place, nice atmosphere, blah blah blah.  I've eaten a ton of places in Vegas and this ones pretty good."}
{"text":"Love the decor, atmosphere and experience at Lago! The food is phenomenal and every dish is made to perfection. The servers are very knowledgable and the staff is attentive to all needs. The meatballs and calamari are by far some of the best I have ever had. I also highly recommend the smooth Reisling that was paired excellent with the salad I had, per server recommendation."}
{"text":"Where to start?  This place is phenomenal from front to back. The view is stunning, helping make this my favourite restaurant. We were able to see the water show at the Bellagio from our window side table. 
The cocktail list was phenomenal, and the service quick and perfect. Our server was very professional. 
The food was delicious. My only regret was not being able to try more."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Lago since it moved from Tremont to the Flats East Bank. The new location has great space, but it much smaller than the old
location. 

First bread was served with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and some seasoning. It was definitely a notch above you typical bread service at most restaurants.

My husband and I started with the Sophia pizza which included arugula, mushrooms, cheese and truffle oil. It was absolutely delicious.

I had the tagliatelle with meatballs in a tomato sauce and it was good. The meatballs were pretty large and the pasta was cooked al dente. It was a large portion and I only ate 1/2.

My husband ordered the burger, which was served with homemade chips. It was large and very tasty. It had salami on top and was very filling.

We also splurged for dessert and went for tiramisu. While it was tasty, I don't know that I would describe it as a traditional tiramisu as it lacked a coffee/espresso flavor. The plate featured a salted caramel drizzle, which was delicious. 

Overall, it was a terrific meal. Additionally, while parking can be costly, the new Flats East Bank is beautiful and we were able to spend some time walking on the board walk."}
{"text":"Great food and view, but rudest hostess I've encountered. She definitely put a huge damper on what was supposed to be a nice and special birthday memory."}
{"text":"Yesterday my wife and I had lunch at Lago. We scored a great table next to the window overlooking the fountains ( table 67). We each ordered the prix fix menu comprised of three courses. I had the antipasto, four cheese lasagna and tiramisu. While my wife had minestrone, branzino and tiramisu. Each was delicious and beautifully plated. Although the wafer thin flatbread served with the antipasto was too delicate to be functional as a vehicle to transport the burrata and prosciutto to my mouth without casualty. The red sauce served with the lasagne may have been the most flavorful I've ever enjoyed. But....the service blemished what would have otherwise been a stellar experience.  Our server, Paul O seemed overwhelmed or at least distracted. We asked for water with lemon - water arrived - no lemon. Twice more visits to our table by Paul before lemon were provided. Later I had finished my iced tea and requested another - it never arrived. On another occasion Paul brought an I Pad to our table for wine selections - we were finished with our entrees and were awaiting coffee and desert. The pace of our meal included an inordinately long delay between our first and second course - the kitchen was not busy - so I suspect Paul failed to put in order to fire our entrees timely. Too bad - ruined what would have been a five star experience ( and the Bellagio fountains we not even operating at lunch time)."}

{"text":"We loved this place! Tasty cocktails, friendly courteous staff. Relaxed, and trendy ambiance. The best part by far was the food. In particular the lobster gnocchi was creamy and melt in your mouth fantastic! One the of the most enjoyable evening dinner out we've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Food is good but not excellent... ordered lamb chops and seafood bucatini (they were quite dried and poor in seafood). Service could be improved! Waiters need to introduce themselves and greet! They are not doing us clients a favor!"}
{"text":"I love their Prix Fixe lunch- $28 and everything is awesome.  Had a caprese salad, bronzino with capers and baby tomatoes and asparagus and a lemoncello cake for dessert.  Sat outside and it was the quietest spot I have been able to find at the Bellagio.  Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Sitting down with friends both new and old at newly opened Lago by Julian Serrano one could not help but comment on the space - the lounge up front lively and full of tightly dressed servers, the long bar well stocked with a bevy of spirits and ubiquitous televisions, and the breathtaking views of the Bellagio fountains gleaming in bright white - all a staunch departure from previous occupant, Circo, and although opinions varied from \"CVS\" to \"trendy and fun\" the service could not have been better, members of our table very well known to the chef and his team leading to an \"anything goes\" sort of experience where much fun was had, and plenty of plates were passed.

Part of the growing 'small-plates' trend, clearly targeting the Hyde crowd with a bumping soundtrack and see-and-be-seen settings, it was just after 6:00pm that our party of six found seating at a large circular table far from the bustle up front, and served family style with the chef making most decisions the meal began with well concocted cocktails and continued swiftly into plates of cheese, charcuterie, fociaccia, and crudo from which only the latter was particularly special - the scallops particularly buttery atop blood oranges with crunchy pistachios dialing up the textural contrast in a way that practically redefined the oft overcooked mollusk.  

Moving next to pastas, several bound to become signatures given the sharability and relative low price compared to meats, breads, and entrees, it was here that the Lago kitchen really flexed its muscles and as good as both the lobster knuckle gnocchi and flatter version soaked in cheesy fondue were it was the risotto that undoubtedly stole the show, the red wine tinged version stretchy and smooth with burrata while the spiced up iteration with mint was the most memorable plate of the evening, small bits of tripe soft and seamlessly blended with rice that was good enough that we immediately requested a second bowl.

Impressed by tender octopus with large cous-cous soaked in black ink while wishing that the crostini with spicy Calabrian pork as well as the pizza were perhaps twice the size considering the price, it was here that the menu unfortunately found a few weaknesses, for as good as the previous pastas had been neither the Malloreddos or the Canneloni were particularly memorable, the former's pasta dramatically undercooked while the sauce of each was no better than stuff from a jar or Chef Boyardee.

Moving to heavier proteins, though not particularly a fan of veal it should be noted that the Viteello Tonnato stood heads and shoulders above the piccata, particularly as a light option for those heading to the club next door, and although both the meatballs and shortribs were 'good,' neither were nearly on par with versions available both on and off strip, though both will surely please palates of the less adventurous sort.

Personally impressed by the quail, while others found the pork-wrapped bird to be far too greasy, it was with two large plates that savories would conclude and although the osso buco is a good rendition the dollar-per-ounce ratio was far tilted to the left compared to better versions at Portofino and Allegro while the $55 Garganelli's pasta and tomatoes were textbook, though the lobster was overcooked and flavorless - a damned shame considering the quality of the one served over the gnocchi noted above.

Taking coffee, a strong double espresso over ice that could have just as easily been replaced by the tiramisu cocktail I'd ordered to kick things off, along with desserts it was with an unfortunate whimper that Lago closed out the evening, for as 'cute' as each of the five plates was not a single bite save for the Limoncello spiked Amalfi was better than something found at Bellagio Buffet, let alone nearby Jean-Phillipe, the $10 each tab harkening memories of Bazaar by Jose Andres for least inspired and overpriced pastries available in a city where no lack of exquisite desserts exist.

Expectedly precious and pricey, though no bill was presented to our table, Lago has a long way to go before becoming a 'go to' for people serious about their food and although I'm sure early reviews will be gushing given the nature of Las Vegas food media (and the fact that Serrano smartly launched the place with a Yelp event giving food, and $125 gift cards away to 'gold' elites) the truth is that better Italian food can be found in almost any US City at half the cost, or in nearly any local casino without all the bright lights and Avicii overhead."}
{"text":"With the great reviews we were excited to try this place. As we came to the hostess counter we were met with great attitude despite trying to be nice. We asked if we could sit in the patio , they said your seat will have some view..... then as we sat in the patio we were given a time limit rudely of 1 hour and 45 min?? 

Then the weighter came who was very nice and accommodating . Out of curiosity I asked people sitting on the next table if they had the same time limit. Response was yes , they also said they have been there twice and have received the same rude attitude. 

Then I'm like whatever hopefully food is great and it's all worth it .NOPE , I tried 4 dishes and food was very bland . I Thought something was wrong with my taste buds , but everyone on the table agreed . 

For a restaurant of this caliber honestly could've had better food and better service at some cheap burger joint . 


Hopefully the management sees this review and provides training to their staff ."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! Lago has elegant contemporary decor with gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountains. If you want a table right by the window or in the first row of the patio by the fountains, you need to have a small party of 2 or 3 as only small tables are in these areas. 

We sat in the patio which was nicely heated so you don't have to worry about being cold. We enjoyed watching the fountain performance with our tasty dinner. 

Here are the dishes we devoured:

CAPRESE: Must get if you like soft cheese. Simple dish showcases the freshness of the cheese and the tomatoes. 

MARGHERITA: Personal sized pizza with thin crust was a favorite. 

ALLA RICOTTA E MIELE: Cheese with honey toast is good for desert too. I don't fancy goat/sheep cheese, and I think this is was one of those but the rest of our group enjoyed it. 

CAPASANTA: scallops were yummy!

RISOTTO AI FUNGHI E PARMIGIANO: mushroom risotto was my favorite dish of the night. Highly recommended!

7 & 7: lobster and gnocchi were OK; I think the gnocchi have some type of cheese that I didn't care for, but other people didn't mind. The lobster seemed a tad overcooked. 

SPAGHETTI DI FRUTI DI MARE: a big hard to eat since the spaghetti is thicker, but we loved this dish. 

POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO: grilled octopus is a highlight too. 

BRASATO D'ANATRA: Braised shredded duck with creamy polenta is a nice rich dish. 

Branzino sea bass: Must get! The fish is perfectly cooked with the skin crispy and the fish moist. 

Dessert selection may change, but the tiramisu is excellent. The creme brûlée has a good caramelized crust, but I didn't like the custard. It seems to have a lemon or orange taste while I usually opt for a vanilla bean flavor. 

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the memorable dining experience with friendly service, delicious food, and stellar fountain views. Highly recommended! It is also kids friendly with high chairs available unlike other fancier restaurants in Bellagio such as Picasso and Prime that only allows children above 5 years old. The food service is also fast so it's a good choice if you have a show to catch too."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner here quite a bit. Me, my wife, my brother and his wife. It took us a little bit to get into the menu structure, it was very much geared to small plates over time. We really enjoyed it. Some of the plates were hit and miss, but they have a great wine list and a lot of variety and the wait staff is pretty nice. Over all, a nice different place to eat. Maybe four stars, but the price, $380, was a little much for hit and miss on the plates. If they had only missed on one, they would have gotten four stars."}
{"text":"Offers spectacular view of the Bellagio Fountains and the brunch options were all so good it was hard to decide. The champagne cocktails were artfully presented and very tasty. Definitely an experience to repeat on future vegas visits."}
{"text":"Great dinner! We enjoyed a great bottle of wine, view, service and food.

Views of the fountain with the music played inside the restaurant. We went early, 5pm, I could see how later in the evening might be hard to hear the music.
Enjoyed all our food: risotto al vino rosso, 7&7 (gnocchi with lobster knuckles), filetto, lobster with artichoke. All four was enough for the two of us
Service was friendly and punctual. We got with no issues to make our show. 
Definitely would return"}
{"text":"Such a great dinner. Our server, John, was amazing. Food was unreal. Chef Julian Serrano #nailedit."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Lagos is tapas style so it's a bunch of small plates to share. 

We ordered the di mare with linguini, both types of gnocchi, and another pasta with clams. For the gnocchi with blue cheese we added Italian sausage and it was amazing! The Italian sausage was the one that took the cake. So flavorful and delicious. The di mare I definitely recommend to replace the pasta with linguini. Linguini and seafood are the perfect pair and the seafood was so fresh. The lobster knuckle potato gnocchi was also stellar. 

This place is definitely on the pricier side. But the food is flavorful and delicious and the ambiance is really modern and nice. 

Would come back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed Lago on an early Saturday evening before heading out to a concert. The service was excellent and the food very good. The dayboat scallops were plump, fresh, and delicious on an exceptionally tasty bed of tender Cauliflower, chopped crisp apples, and almonds. Cocktail menu was interesting. My Italian white wine, recommended by the server, was full bodied with a clean finish and quite good. My husband ordered a pizza and was impressed with the size, served on a cutting board, and flavor. Many craft beers from which to chose, as well. Liked the warm low- lighting and contemporary, urban vibe. One complaint: some tables are too close or open to the kitchen, and the clanking of silverware and/or the distraction of bright kitchen light was unpleasant. We asked for a different table, and the hostess kindly obliged. It was wonderful to see Cleveland thriving. Three new restaurants on the East bank of the flats, all looked pretty busy, and the Cavs were out of town!"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant. There wasn't a grand entrance but the nice host made up for it. We just moved from San Diego and didn't know many restaurants in Cleveland. We wanted Italian  for Valentine's Day and picked Lago because of the 4 star rating in downtown area. I'm kinda glad we didn't read Brittany's review or else we would have missed a great meal :-).
We brought a bottle that we got from Napa. The waiter came back with 2 very nice huge crystal glasses and a decanter. We ordered Scallop and Kobe Beef Carpaccio for appetizers. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the polenta was surprisingly tasteful. Kobe carpaccio was also great with arugula over bread crackers.
After enjoyed the primi with some good cocktails, we got the wagyu and fillet for our entrées. We wanted Italian but ended up with 2 steaks lol. However, they were both cooked to the textbook medium rare. The wagyu was so exceptional that I had to leave my fillet to help my wife finish it first. The waiter gave us just enough attention to avoid disturbing our conversation. We also liked the cool decor and music. Overall, it was a 5-star experience. We will definitely come back for more wagyu and order some pasta then."}
{"text":"Outstanding wine list as you expect from a Bellagio hotel, also great service and wonderful view of the fountains. We were very pleased with this Italian menu that strays away from the American style (heavy on pasta and sauces) with plenty of seafood options."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I'm eating in this restaurant so when I say their food is good, trust me, it's good. 
I personally would recommend their chopped chicken salad with blue cheese and ppeprcorn dressing or antipasti assortment with your choice of cheese and/or prosciutto, olives etc. Make sure you don't miss their phenomenal meatballs,mmm delicious. 
Service is really good, pancual and pleasant. Real Italian feel with modern look.
Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service and food were both excellent! Italian tapas style... we had the lobster knuckles, veal limone, crab, and cork screw pasta with lamb. We had trouble deciding, but both concluded the pasta dish was our favorite. The only small complaint would be speed - everything was a little too fast. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  The decor is very relaxing.  The wine selection is amazing.  The food and presentation is outstanding! !!  The server was so educated and treated us as if we were his only customers! !!"}
{"text":"The poorest service I have ever received at any restaurant. Server took my order and did not see her again for over 30 minutes. Durimg that time I received the wrong order. After about 10 minutes I finally got someones attention and they removes the order and took straight over to the person that ordered. We finally received part of our order, not all of it. I kept attempting to get any server's attention, but they all ignored us. When our server finally came around we were done eating what food we did receive and asked if we were happy. We told her the situation and she apologized and left. Did not see her again for 15 minutes, whem she asked if we wanted anything else, which we jist wanted the bill. She was nice enough to take off the food we did not receive, but still had to pay for what we did receive without a discount or anything at all. During this whole time we never even got out water glass refilled. We were the imvisible table. Do not eat here. One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. You get better service at Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Excellent vibe, Miami-like ambiance.... Shared food portions. Amazing taste on all our choices, not disappointed. Views and scene is excellent, try to do outdoors or window to enjoy Bellagio water feature..."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Staff was great and allowed my girlfriend and I to move to a window when someone left so we could be closer to the fountain. Meal was amazing. Had five different entrees to share, two or three drinks and it came out around 150 dollars. Sounds bad but we were really full and felt like it wasn't a waste of money at all. The food was beautiful to look and totally satisfying. Go there for date night!"}
{"text":"A minority opinion here: overpriced and overrated. Not bad, but this place would have been barely passable at 2/3 the price. 

Service: slow and not responsive.

Drinks selection: wine adequate to barely ok, beer seriously subpar. 

Food: 
Apps: salumi plates allow no mix and match. So we ordered salami and prosciutto. Four slices of each, neither better than what you get at an average grocery store nowadays, $10 in total. Rip off. 

Mains: ok pizza, average salad (endive and arugula).  We didn't have a formal entree or pasta ... and the price for Two people: almost a c-note. Much better - and cheaper - dining options in Cleve. 

Decor was a little too \"not quite upscale new hotel.\" It won't age well."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch - food was okay service was superb and the view was spectacular!!! It made me happy so five stars!"}
{"text":"I wish I could vote in 1/2 stars as my review is for 4.5 stars which is why I am choosing 4 stars. 
The good: beautiful restaurant; beautiful view, delicious food. Brunch on Sunday was great! You choose a first and second course. A pastry basket comes to your table before that and dessert via a beautiful dessert buffet is open to you after the second course. 
Bottomless mimosas or bellinis or bloody Mary's available. I tried the Bellini with peach and then with mango purée. The mango won! The bellinis are outstanding here!  My first course was the antipasto: really good. Everyone's appetizer looked amazing. For the second course, I ordered the chicken florentine... Wow! Delicious is an understatement. All entrees were delicious! 
The dessert buffet is out of control!!! Everything from a chocolate fountain to fresh fruit to crepes to beautiful and divine cakes and pastries! 

The not bad but not great: 
- it took a while for us to get our bills and be able to pay. 
-the restaurant was so crowded with tables and moving your seat was a limited ability. Maybe it was because it was Easter? 
-pricey. If getting brunch with bottomless drink option, it is about $100.00 per person. Without it, about $70.00 per person. 
- they initially did not want to seat us until our whole party was here. They were very nice about it. Some people were late. We were just waiting outside of the restaurant. One of our friends actually went up and talked to them and they finally sat us down even though we were waiting for one more person. I can see why they may want to do that, yet it is Sunday brunch and all you want to do is sit back and relax.

Overall, enjoyed it and would go back! Everyone was nice."}
{"text":"Epic Fail! My husband made reservations for our anniversary to have dinner here. We agreed to wait for a table with a view of the lake. Our hostess seated me while my husband cashed out at the bar. She told me we had a time limit on the table that is strictly enforced and expected me to agree to it before I sat down which I did not and deferred to my husband. He really had his heart set on trying Julian Serrano's food. The hostess told him that we had a finite amount of time at the table and walked away. Neither of us were pleased at the idea of spending hundreds of dollars for dinner and being rushed              through it. We then sat at the table for at least ten minutes without any server acknowledging that we were even there. During this time my husband went to Open Table a booked a reservation across the street at Giada's which has small plates and entrees of delicious Italian food. We had eaten there a few nights before and were blown away by how great the food and service was. On our way out we made a point of telling the manager what had happened at Lago and he said that they don't strictly enforce time limits on tables. What kind of fine dining establishment puts time limits on their tables??? The kind that we will not pay top dollar for fast food with slow service!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. Had a great view of the water. Service was amazing! Food was excellent. Loved having the small plates and being able to share. All the food came out fast too which was great because we were all hungry."}
{"text":"We trekked through one of the many 2014 snow storms to be greeting by a calming environment and a warm fireplace.  It was a Tuesday, so the place was filled just enough.  We started with Balsamic and Rosemary chips which had great flavor and snackability, and the boys chose some cured meat plate (KOBE CARPACCIO) which wasn't appealing to me that night, however that went down before I could even decide if I wanted to venture out.  

For my meal, I got the plain jane of the menu, fresh pasta and meatballs (PAPAREDELLE E POLPETTE).  It was actually just one meatball, so I had to be wise with how I rationed it.  Everything was delicious, the portion was perfect, as it left me full without having to roll out of the car in my driveway.  

I should mention the warm bread dipped in their olive oil was also fanatic.  Smooth, soft, and light.  As they place one slice on each person's plate, that eliminates my need for eating the whole basket of whatever is in front and saving my stomach for the good stuff.

Great service, atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"THAT VIEW DOE. The Bellagio fountain show with the Eiffel Tower in the background - how romantic is that? Of course, I came here with my significant other for his birthday. I made the reservation on Open Table just a couple weeks before, and luckily, I was able to get a 6:30pm reservation. At first, I was a little bummed cause I wanted a later dinner, but this was actually the perfect time to go! We got seated by the window and got to see the fountain show both in the daytime and nighttime! The music was difficult to hear inside the restaurant though. I wish they turned it up a little, at least during the show, since the music really enhances experience. But I've seen the fountain show plenty of times before, and this was the best view I've had!
Anyway, onto the food. They have plenty of dishes to choose from, and it's a small plates style, so you can try out several different dishes without filling your stomach too quickly. We ordered 9 different plates - some were average, others were good, and others were absolutely yummy. My favorite plates were the 7&7 and calamaro ripieno! They also brought us tasty cannolis for dessert, which was complimentary since it was my boyfriend's birthday! Overall, a great dining experience with a beautiful view!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had in a very long time. Everything from the appetizers down to the dessert was phenomenal. The view was spectacular, the dishes played songs on my tongue. The raspberry belinni was the best I ever had. Def a spot worth checking out during your visit to Vegas. I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Largo was so good.  My fiancée and I went there will I was working in Cleveland.  We got recommended to go there and so glad we went.  The food was so good and bottle of wines were affordable."}
{"text":"My friend coordinated a girl's brunch during the holiday weekend.

Some Pros and Cons are listed below:

PROS
-Great view of the fountain
-tasty entrees, tried the salmon salad, my friends were a fan of the mushrooms and pasta
-the Lago cocktail was very pretty and elaborate with the ice ball that had a flower in the ice

CONS
-We get it, super busy restaurant, not very attentive
-place opened at 1130 but my girls wanted to set up a little with regards to the party favors but they wouldn't let them in a little earlier to set up, cutting it close they said even though the place was empty and there was already staff moving about"}
{"text":"Tip #1: Don't come here hungry.
Tip #2: Only come hungry if you are willing to order every dish on the menu and spend lots of money.  (That is the only way I can see one satisfying their appetite here.)

I knew coming in that the dishes were small plates made for sharing, but I didn't realize all you could get out of one dish was basically a taste of it.  Dishes ordered:

- Caesar salad: 2 leaves apiece for my sister and me

- Margherita pizza: 2 very small slices apiece

- Ravioli al Gamberi: 2 (or 4?) bite-size pasta shells apiece

- Dessert: 2 tiny bites apiece

The food was very bland in my opinion.  My taste buds enjoy themselves at Olive Garden more than they did here :p  You can get better everything anywhere else and for so much cheaper too.  The reason why you come here though is for the view: floor-to-ceiling windows for a great view of the fountain show right outside.  

We unfortunately were not able to get a seat out on the patio.  The patio is first-come, first-served, and there was a big party that got there right before us and occupied most of the outdoor seating area until almost closing.  We were at least sat at a table right by the window.   

Service was great.  The hostess was meh but all the guys who served us were excellent!  The stars I'm giving are for those guys, as well as for the view of the fountain show.

P.S. For cocktails I recommend the Cucumber Mist.  My sister ordered it and let me try it - it was light and refreshing.  I ordered the Rossa Bellini mainly for the golden caramel nest.  It packed a punch and was Instagram-worthy haha.  I preferred the Cucumber Mist, though."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I went to Lago today for Sunday brunch!!! The food and drinks were awesome! Our waitress Monique was very knowledgable and gave awesome recommendations on food and drinks. She was very attentive and never forgot to check in on us! We had such a memorable experience at Lago that we will for sure be coming back. You must try Lago! Ask for Monique!"}
{"text":"I'm bummed the fountains were not live when I was here for lunch. Nonetheless I had a spectacular view of the calm waters overlooking the faux le tour Eiffel. 

I came for brunch/lunch. Caesar salad was cute and tasty. There were 5 small Romaine lettuces. I would take off one star because the lettuce was slighting burnt or brown. For entree I had the seafood pasta. It was also a safe and good choice. 

The restaurant does tout a big deal for the chef. I'm way more impressed with the decor and ambiance than the food (chill edm beats). So my stars are for the relaxed, club like environment for a date."}
{"text":"Well I had made reservations for 3 and we had to wait 15min after our reservations. We dint get a window view like we requested, The food had no flavor, and the deserts are horrible they taste like a dry chocolate cake and one small spoon of ice cream lol, We order a none alcoholic drink and the taste was horrible am not even kidding the juice tasted like it had gone bad!!!
 I mean Really bad, and to top it all off we had a waitress with black hair dint get her name, I was so upset that I forgot, No customer service and had major attitude, the waiters seemed more friendlier...But never again do I go here or refer anyone  sorry. 
One drink, bottle water n 2 deserts and small salad $100 with tip horrible food and rud staff so"}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants on the Strip, Lago is my personal favorite. It's located right behind the Fountains of Bellagio and it has a gigantic glass wall so you can see the water show while dining. It gets especially beautiful at night when all the lights of the Strip reflect on the lake and the water glistens and you can see Paris and Planet Hollywood in the background. The interior decor is very modern and clean, chairs are comfortable, and it has a vibe that, to me, is different from other Strip restaurants.

I haven't tried all their dishes (most are small plates that are shareable with 2 people), but the ones I have tried so far are the pork ribs, mushroom risotto, shrimp-stuffed squid, and sea bass (catch of the day). All were small plated except for the sea bass. The pork ribs are fantastic when eaten hot, same for the risotto. The squid was cooked perfectly but the  flavors were just okay compared to the pork and risotto. The sea bass was a bit bland, and the garnish (something along the lines of a ratatouille) didn't seem to mesh well with the flavors of the fish. But that's just my personal opinion, and none of the food was actually bad. The overall dining experience was perfect, and I'll definitely be coming back for a 4th time on my next trip."}
{"text":"This past Sunday evening (5/24), Sadly was not able to eat here. Made a reservation and I arrived I was advised it would be \"25 to 30 minutes or more.\"  The couple that walked in right behind me were asked by the hostess if they had a reservation, and they said no. The hostess say then 10 minutes later. I walked out to Fix instead."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend on the fourth of July. As we got closer to the flats you can smell the Abercrombie and fitch. We tried a couple places on the water but they were very crowded so we ended up here. They have a very nice patio with a bar. We had a beet salad and the Basil mozzarella pizza and it was delicious. Glad we found it and I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"So good! My husband and I went here before heading out to see a show. The restaurant is decorated beautifully and we got sat right in front of the windows overlooking the fountains. Our waiter (so sad we didn't get his name!) was amazing and made the experience even better. Every dish we got was so yummy - elevated Italian food but still with home-y flavors. If you are looking for a nice dinner out I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Come for a meal and the bellagio waterworks. Th-th-that's all folks. 
Food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"The bartender was a babe and awesome!  Dranks were Dranks.  Nothing special.  Cool hip place!   I wish I got to try the food!  I'm totally going back next time I'm in CLE!!!"}
{"text":"7x7! When you go here make sure to get a few orders of this!! Lobster and gnocchi is to die for! Another great dish is the risotto. All items are a little on the pricey side, but worth it if you're out on the strip for the night."}
{"text":"The food did not taste fresh and the flavors seemed bland. The waiters did not offer to bring fresh parmesan, despite the fact that there were over 8 people. The waiter did not come by after the first few bites to see how everything tasted. They suggested everyone order 3 items on the menu which is too much food. We got two large bottles of
wine for the for the table and ended up pouring the wine for each other at the table versus having the waiter come by to fill the glasses for us. I was surprised over all, the service did not meet Las Vegas standards and neither did the food."}
{"text":"Great view of the water show but beyond that it's a very average restaurant.  Food choices are suspect and hardly Italian.   Loud, crowded, and no room to move around.  Wouldn't eat there again!"}
{"text":"Every visit in Vegas in the future I will try to be in that place.
Excellent service and atmospheric.
The food is tasty and the desert amazing.
Thank you"}
{"text":"I would like to personally thank ,Mr Albert Najem for an amazing job making our first dining experience at Lago Restaurant  a very elegant yet very relaxing atmosphere. Food was phenomenal , service was over the top. Will definitely be  back soon with friends and family  ."}
{"text":"I loved the outside view with the fountains. Had dinner so it was nice to see sunset. Although I wasn't impressed with the food I still gave it four starts because I was definitely impressed with the view. Its a beautiful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lobster and squid ink pasta was amazing!! Actually everything was amazing. Beautiful view and the friendliest chef! Service was great as well."}
{"text":"My third time At Lago!! Second time at the bar! Cocktails as always amazing but what made me write a review this time is one of your amazing bartenders Regina! She embodies all the qualities I would like my guest to experience when they're dinning at my bar: amazing mixologist, humble, REAL! Sad but true...You don't get much of the last one in Vegas anymore!!!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner at Lago with a friend, with a fountain view table. The food was delicious and I really liked the small portions served, which was just enough to finish. Also, it gave us a chance to try several dishes. I recommend going after 8 P.M. Since the fountain show happens every 15mins (over the usual 30mins). Truly is quite a show!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place in LV.  We like to sit at the bar, have drinks and order a few plates.  The bartenders have been extremely knowledgeable, helpful and attentive.  Food comes quickly.  Great atmosphere.  On our most recent visit to LV, we ate there three times.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Seated - Had a reservation, great table
Server- took 5 min to greet and the 10 min to return. I had to approach the server for service
Food - Veal ravioli? Veal is ground, that's baby food or poor execution in the kitchen. Short Rib Cannelloni- Baby food also. The Shrimp in octopus? Really, the cost of 20/26's is nothing. Tasted like any other average restaurant that serves shrimp. Gnocchi- it was hand molded or by a device but the oil was not hot enough and you could see the color- server said it was braised? Nothing braised about this product? Interesting. Pizza- AWESOME. Cheese plate - interesting. 

FOR THIS MUCH MONEY- not worth it! :)"}
{"text":"Reservations for 1 at Christmas Day.  The first table was in the middle of the run around so we asked manager for a better table.  He sat us at the best table on the patio under the heat lamps.  He was a doll and made sure I was happy since it was christmas and I had brought my whole family for the first time.  My boy was delighted by the water show every 15 minutes.  Service, as always was amazing.  They had a pre-fix meal choose two items off the menu and an all you can eat pastries, HEAVEN.  Bananas fosters, crepes, cakes, cookies, sugar heaven.  My main I had the salmon salad.  Wow sliced fresh salmon on a bed of greens.  Delicious.  Then i chose the tenderloin and i could cut it with my fork with hash brown potatoes. To top it off $28 all you can drink bloody mary or mimosa.  What a deal for everything.  We were so lucky to experience this place especially on Christmas Day.  And enjoyed every decadent moment.  I can say Lago is my favorite restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came for a myvegas free cocktail. Had to go to the MLife desk first and they were fast and friendly. No quibbling about the free $20 drink which was the best Margarita I've ever had. It was smoked peach, so delicious. The view, even during lunchtime on a hot summer day was beautiful. The fountains danced to \"America the Beautiful\" at the top of the hour. The myvegas deal required ordering at least the prix fixe lunch. We were considering other lunch entrees, like seafood pasta, but the prix fixe had the best options to try a variety of dishes. Everything was spectacular. We had the Caprese salad and minestrone soup to start. The Caprese had delicious ripe tomatoes and was perfectly seasoned. The soup was light and full of yummy vegetables like potato and squash. It was finished with a dollop of pesto that gave it a great flavor. For our entrees we had the lasagna verde and the branzino. The desserts were amazing and I'm so glad we got the prix fixe for this course, if nothing else. Such a cute rendition of black forest cake and a mocha toffee chocolate cake. The pastry chef is top notch. I will definitely come back here. We took a look at the dinner menu and will plan ahead with reservations for that next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just terrible went with my family today for breakfast. My wife ordered chicken and waffles. The waffles under cooked and chicken over cooked. I ordered sausage gravy made with chorizo with two poached eggs over a bisket. The eggs raw and cold. My son ordered egg sandwich the plate was dripping with dirty grease and big chunks of black crude from the grill. I do not recommend this place at all. Just terrible."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review for happy hour.

Ya know. I've been here for more than one occasion for happy hour.  And I feel like like all the patrons around me need to put a dollar in the douche bag jar.  It's one thing to be out and loud because ya know, ya had one too many because pinot noir was $5 and you couldn't resist. It's another if it's because you're BFF with the bartender and you're making all the other people at the bar uncomfortable talking about iPhone updates.  The wine and cocktails and food are still outstanding, don't get me wrong.  But there is a point where that stops being important because everyone is so annoying. From the bar staff who took 10 minutes to bring me a menu to the bartender who asked me if I wanted another drink and got distracted and walked away because her friend interrupted me talking and asked if she could have another coffee.

Maybe that makes me annoying?  It's quite possible. Happy hour might be a good deal... but at Lago it comes at the price of grating on your every nerve."}
{"text":"I had the best brunch I've had in a long time!! They have bottomless mimosas and $5 bloody Mary's! I had a sausage omelet that was enormous and so tasty! 

The space is really cool -- dark wood and a nice big bar! The prices for brunch are totally reasonable ($9-15) and the service was great. 

It doesn't get the love it deserves as a brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for our anniversary. I've always wanted to eat at one of places behind the bellaigo fountains.  First off I was hoping that the tables would be open to the fountains however they are not you do however have a unique view of the fountains.  Second I was hoping to get a little extra attention by letting staff know about the anniversary but really all they said was congratulations.  The staff was very good at everything else overall service was very good. The food was very good my only issue with small
Plate restaurants is that they charge you like it's s full plate example is my wife ordered a 7x7 lobster and gnocchi and it came with 7 gnocchi's and 7 small chunks of lobster which is fine but a bit steep.  Overall not a bad experience the food was good just would have liked a little more even for a small plate place would really put this as a 3.75 stars"}
{"text":"I have been in Júlia serrano in aria hotel so after being here feel little disappointed because I was expecting more overall good food not outstanding if you compare to the other place but love the location"}
{"text":"Have been here for dinner and brunch. We were seated outside for dinner and we tried several of the dishes, being tapas style portions are small and meant to be shared. We ordered a couple of the pizettes, veggie and seafood pasta and most were great. The dessert menu was not very exciting.  My brunch review gives high marks for the view again, inside but we could still see the water show.  We had a reservation, but still waited nearly a half hour to be seated, guess they were trying to push bar purchases, but highly annoyed with a half hour wait having a reservation to only be seated inside. Food selections were very good off the menu.  Brunch service was poor. Our waiter forgot to bring the pastry basket, we had to ask, while other guests next to us that we're seated after us had another waiter, and ordered and had food, plus pastry basket long before we did.  We had to ask for several things as the meal comtinued as the waiter was either over extended in the service area or was just having a bad day.  I would recommend dinner for sure at Lago. For brunch, I would have some hesitations about going back as a local with all the other brunch options in Vegas based on Lago's poor service and having to wait so long with a reservation."}
{"text":"stayed at the bellagio this past week...strolled by lago one evening and became intrigued with the new restaurant with chef serrano...knowing a reservation would be hard to come by we checked with the staff and was advised we could order the full menu in the lounge..perfect account we were not too hungry so ordering off the menu with a few select choices was so appropriate for us..love the small plate italian menu..you can walk away from dinner and not feel stuffed...we enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad..veal piccata and red wine risotto...perfection..as great as the food was this review is mainly for the outstanding service we received from kelly k......she was attentive..personable..gave great advice regarding our menu questions and as busy as the lounge was she was there with a smile and moved our dining experience along..though we never felt rushed....as a restaurant opens there is always the  honeymoon phase..but keeping top notch staff like kelly k. things will go smoothly..kudos to her and chef serrano..looking forward to our next stay at bellagio..and this time we will arrive at lago ready to try more items off the inventive menu"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work and we had a team dinner here.  All of the food was fantastic.  We tried so many different things.  I don't even know where to start.  They were even very nice about making special items for one person who has to be gluten free.  We had about 12 people and they did make us all wait until everyone was there before they would seat us.  I hate when restaurants do that.  But luckily we did not wait too long.  The bartender took care of us for a few minutes while we waited.  She was wonderful and gave us some good wine options to try.

Here are a few of the things we had. There is definitely other stuff.

BRUSCHETTA AL POMODORO - tomatoes | basil | garlic oil 
MARGHERITA - tomato sauce | house made mozzarella | basil
CHEESE PLATTER - briaco del Piave | quadrello di bufala | pecorino | Parmigiano | carta musica bread
SALUMI -- COLD CUTS PLATTER - prosciutto di Parma  finocchiona salame  rosemary porchetta | carta musica bread 
FUSILLIORO - corkscrew pasta: Abruzzo | lamb ragù | spuma di ricotta
SALMONE - pistachio crusted salmon | oven dried tomatoes | rapini | red wine sauce FILETTINO - 4oz Angus beef tenderloin | gorgonzola

We also had a variety of desserts. Everything was really good.  They took really good care of us and brought was way too much food.

It would have been nice to sit by the window to see the Bellagio fountains but otherwise we had a nice time.  The restaurant is very modern."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was very good.  Its not the cheapest but the food and service is worth the money.  And the wait for a patio seat is worth it to see the fountains at dinner."}
{"text":"Pushing the $$$$ mark, don't get caught off guard. This is small tapas portions, you will need a few of them to fill you up. After a glass of wine, tax and tip you may find yourself pushing that $60 marker per person. I will start with the good... the fountain view. Also, the food has some good flavors I especially enjoyed the (small) fungi and the branzino (fish).

Things I didn't care for were the lobster/seafood risotto which had 1 small piece of lobster in it. They should call it the shrimp risotto. And the $12 caesar salad which was 5-6 small pieces of romaine with dressing, cheese and anchovies dumped on top. We sent it back. Also don't order the pizzas, they are 4\" (literally, I'm not exaggerating). I have been to my share of 5-star restaurants including Pizza Mozza in Hollywood, where they make their pizza bigger than that.

Service was average, nothing to ride home about for the prices. It is supposed to be family-style but I was never offered a fresh plate or utensils. Most of my group was disappointed and it didn't make me look great since I was the one who found Lago on yelp. I know Vegas is expensive but I also expect to get quality when I pay for it. I did not find that at Lago."}
{"text":"I organized a brunch for 12 ladies and the service was fabulous! I love the style of the restaurant and that the fountains are visible while you are eating. The cocktails were also unique and yummy. I got the caprese salad and added 4 jumbo shrimp and I also got a side of mushrooms. I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Im sure this is a 4 or 5 star place but when I visited I only had the cauliflower and it was ehhh. It really just didnt do it for me. Would have preferred if the seasoning was on small pieces battered and fried. 

So this review is just based on that. 

Everyone else loved their food and they had a huge selection of wine so my advice is eat here just not the cauliflower."}
{"text":"Ate here twice during a business trip to Cleveland. Their late night menu offers a limited variety of food, but there is enough variety to satisfy most cravings. Their regular dinner menu is pricier but if offers a larger and more sophisticated variety of foods. Service was quick and the food was cooked in a timely manner. The food was savory and portions where very satisfying. Both the drinks and their food menu has very reasonable prices. Overall a good experience and a great alternative if you are staying at the A loft and don't wish to go far."}
{"text":"You get to watch a pretty amazing water show while you dine but the ambiance is so noisy I feel like it takes away from your dining experience. I had to yell across the table to talk to my friends and half of the time we can't even hear anything except for the obnoxious party next to us.

Not a big fan of small plates but the food was delicious. The mushroom risotto which we kept ordering additional orders was (by far) the best item on their menu.

Has the potential to be a great date night spot if the noise wasn't the same as a bar."}
{"text":"We had post wedding ceremony reservations here, when we came they said they are on break and will not be serving. Not sure why we were not given that information before reservations were placed. Poorly organized and pretentious."}
{"text":"Fantastic bar with great staff, if you don't know what to get they'll just whip something up, if it doesn't work out they'll just toss it and try again!"}
{"text":"All around fantasic experience.  Lago by Julian Serrano is the old Circo, and the space is now totally different.  All white - very open and modern, with huge windows overlooking the fountains and lake.  Every table has a great view.  It s an energetic environment.

The food and sevice were just fantastic.  We tried 8-10 tapas dishes, and everything was simply wonderful.  The featured cocktails, as well as desserts were also great.   Our server was exceptional - always around the table, and there whenever we needed him.

Prices were also suprrising reasonable.  We normally expect $100 to $150 a person at a place like this, and it was under $100.   We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We got there at 5 pm to get the best seat on the heated patio facing the fountains. View:5 stars.
Service: superb! They leave you alone when the fountain shows are on and come explain everything on the menu with detail whenever you are ready. 5 stars again!
Food: we got the fresh white truffle special (it was $50 for a single tapa) but well worth it. We paid more at Sinatra for a black truffle specials few years ago..then we got the Gnocchi (blue cheese) it was delicious melt-in-your-mouth goodness, followed by the zucchini pizza. These were so filling for the 2 of us.. we got the tiramisu (delicious) followed by the coffee cocktail. Everything was superb, well
Crafted and delicious. 5 stars for all of it! Will come again and again!"}
{"text":"Very upscale. Location= winning. Drinks= superb. Food= so so. Service= fairly decent. Calamari was good in a tomato soup. Risotto was yucky in an acorn squash shell. Everyone else I dined with seemed pretty content. I was fairly underwhelmed. Whatever, I like Long John Silvers. What do I know? Go there anyway."}

  Lago is the latest project of Michelin Starred Chef Julian Serrano, he's been one of the original celebrity chefs to see the vision of Las Vegas; believe in it enough to move from San Francisco to Las Vegas to open Picasso at Bellagio; nearly 20 years later, just opened up LAGO in April 2015. 

   In 1998, Serrano brought his memorable Mediterranean-French cooking to Bellagio in Las Vegas as executive chef of Picasso. The Michelin two-star restaurant has been a 14-time recipient of the AAA Five Diamond Award from 2002 to 2014 and has received the coveted Grand Award from Wine Spectator magazine for its extensive wine list. 

   Chef Serrano then turned his unerring eye to the cuisine of his native Spain as executive chef of his eponymous restaurant, Julian Serrano, at ARIA Resort & Casino, which opened in 2009.  Featured on the restaurant's multiple à la carte menus is an ensemble of Serrano's signature creations including traditional and innovative renditions of tapas, paellas, seafood and more.  In 2010, Esquire magazine named Julian Serrano one of the Best New Restaurants of the year.  The restaurant also received the Best of Award of Excellence from Wine Spectator magazine in 2011.

    In April 2015, Chef Serrano opened LAGO at Bellagio in 2015. Lago by Julian Serrano will be the chef's first Italian restaurant and explored a new take on social dining. The restaurant's small plate menu will celebrate Chef Serrano's creativity and signature flavors.  Lago serves contemporary, Milan-inspired Italian small plates. I got to try plenty of dishes the last 2 months here and all were on point. 

    Lago boasted spectacular views of the resort's iconic fountains on the Las Vegas Strip. If you can RSVP an outdoor table in the evening, you would enjoy it tremendously. 

   Service is excellent here as always. If you don't have time for dinner, Lago is a perfect spot for a cocktails before dinner or show. sit at the beautiful long bar and lounge, I enjoy bartenders Emer and Christopher, they are both fantastic.  The cocktails list is amazing, you MUST TRY at least 1! 

- POLPA DI GRANCHIO E FARRO, fresh crabmeat, organic farro grain, confetti 

- FEGATINI DI POLLO, chicken liver, capers, pepperoncino

- FUSILLIORO, corkscrew pasta: Abruzzo, lamb ragù, spuma di ricotta, love it.

- BRODETTO DI VONGOLE, clams, spicy white wine, love it.

- AGNELLO SCOTTADITO, grilled lamb chops, garlic, rosemary, perfection.

- POLPETTE DI CARNE, tomato braised beef meatballs, so good.

- OSSO BUCO, red wine-braised veal shank, polenta al formaggio, delicous, super tender."}
{"text":"Lago is located in the heart of the Bellagio with excellent views of the fountains. We made last minute reservations for a Monday night after eating at Julian Serrano's Tapas restaurant the night before (which was amazing!), but when we arrived, the place was mostly empty. The hostess took a few minutes to seat us, and once she did, a server didn't show up for at least 5-7 minutes. Once someone came to take our drink order, someone else came by two minutes later to take our drink order again...which was very confusing and a bit frustrating. Many employees were standing around, and the organization of the place seemed a bit off. 

The food is of course tapas style, which we thought was very fun for Italian food, since I'm always indecisive about main courses.

We split:
- caprese: great tomatoes
- cesare: super solid
- malloreddos: our least favorite dish; it kind of felt like hamburger helper...
- gnocchi alla romana: yummy, yummy, & yummy; get this one!
- branzino livornese: good, not great

For dessert, we split the tiramisu, which was amazing, and the lemon tart, which was pretty good. We did feel a bit rushed with our check, as it was brought with our dessert...not a very respectful practice in such a nice restaurant...

Overall, Lago was a perfectly good experience; the food was good, but the service and organization was lacking."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Overrated. Extremely noisy. And you get funny looks if you order a non-alcoholic drink. A glass of wine costs around $18."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for drinks and appetizers, but everything I had was amazing. We ordered the Salerno Family Meatballs and the calamari. I like calamari just sauteed, no breading to over complicate the dish. The calamari rings and tentacles were cooked perfectly and the spicy sauce was great with the calamari and for dipping the bread in. The meatballs were large and a delicious blend of beef, veal and pork. 

The dessert options sounded good too. Next time I want the tiramisu. This time though I tried the creme brulee. I get this dessert a lot and they all pretty much taste the same. Not sure how they did it, but Lago's creme brulee somehow stood out among the crowd. 

Aubrey was a great waitress full of passion for Lago and possessive of a true love for the food. I was impressed with her attention to detail too. The meatball appetizer comes with just three meatballs, but since there were four of us she asked if we wanted an extra one. Aubrey gave us a general overview of the entire menu pointing out recent additions and her favorites. She made me hungry for everything from pizza to scallops. I will have to stop in again soon to have a full meal."}
{"text":"We went for the prefix lunch for $28 which is very reasonable for the Bellagio. The ala carte items were reasonably priced too. The portions sizes were adequate for a filling lunch but not a stuffed to the gills experience. The fountains were visible from our window seats and it is a quite different experience from having to stand and jostle with the crowds outside.

The food was quite tasty except for the lemon dessert which was too tart for me. I would return for dinner at some point to experience the fountains in the evening."}
{"text":"Very good for lunch. Light dishes. Clean and modern atmosphere. Friendly staff. 
None of the dishes were particularly memorable but all are shareable (like tapas) so make sure you try a few dishes."}
{"text":"This was a beautiful and delicious restaurant with perfect views of the Bellagio fountains. We had a team dinner so they were very attentive and accommodating. Pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I have many qualms about Lago.  First the place is so loud you cannot speak to your company.  Second the service is pushed, too intense and not at all relaxing. 
More importantly the food was just so so.  Small portions, way to small in my opinion.  10$ for three slivers of lettuce is a joke.  The octopus had no flavor.  The pasta is genuinely good, but again for noodles and sauce at $15 I expect a little more. 
I hate going out to a place with mediocre food and leaving $150 poorer and still have to go eat elsewhere because I'm hungry 2 hours later.   Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"HOLY COW! 

A Spanish Chef opening an Italian tapas restaurant. That doesn't make sense, you say? Well you're wrong! 

Lago by Julian Serrano has replaced the space previously occupied by Circo. Everything is meant to be shared, and they recommend 3-4 plates per person. I was lucky enough to attend the soft opening, and it definitely didn't disappoint. 

First, the atmosphere. It's bright, hip and lively. There is an open kitchen so you can watch the magic happen. There is also window seating, facing the Fountains, and a small patio. 

I can't say enough about the food. Everything was really delicious and well prepared. I am still in awe over the branzino and also the grilled octopus (squid? Don't recall) served with black squid ink, risotto style. The smoky grill flavor on both of these items was out of this world! 

Another favorite was the scallops crudo with blood orange. And the filet with Gorgonzola jus. And don't miss the risotto rosa with burrata! Seriously, everything was phenomenal! 

The wine, cocktails and beers were on an iPad. I didn't explore this list as much as I should (I didn't even look at the beer!). They don't have an extensive list of house cocktails, but what they do offer was good. The Cucumber Mist and Lago Cocktail were both hits. 

Prices are to be expected for the Strip, but the portions are well sized for tapas and I think it's worth the cost.

They officially open on 4/11. If you get a chance, go in for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went last night for our wedding anniversary and def on my list of places never to go to again! They seated us in a little corner outside as my husband had requested outdoor eating...it was uncomfortable and literally in the corner (as I'm 6 months pregnant)! Twice other tables opened up but when we requested to move the waiter would respond \"they are taken\"...how are they taken of supposedly you can't make a reservation outside? Food is too weird and it's trying too hard to be unique but doesn't even taste that good! I know it's tapas and meant to share but literally the pizza is like smaller than a kids personal pizza! When you order food immediately comes out as if it's all prepared and I felt as tho we were being rushed through the entire dinner when we were trying to enjoy our anniversary dinner! Waiter was not friendly either and no help when we asked questions about things on the menu! Only thing this place has going for them is the view to the fountains of you are lucky enough to get a decent seat...not like our little corner table! Plenty of better dining choices in vegas, don't bother coming here!"}
{"text":"We attended for a Yelp event, which was awesome and stayed for a quick bite at the bar.  The food at the Yelp event was super tasty, so I would order most of those things again (cheese and charcuiterie, pizza, and a veal pasta that was so good!).  

My fiance and I just ordered a ceasar salad and some wine.  The bartender seemed a bit out of it and didn't pay very much attention to us.  We would have ordered more food, but putting in the salad and having it come out took a great deal of time and it was getting very late.  The salad, however, was good overall, but slightly overdressed.  

We will absolutely be back because I love their lobster gnocci and meatballs, but we just might make certain to leave extra time for the meal."}
{"text":"Great location. View of the Bellagio fountain is great if you can get a table near the window. 

I was surprised to be get an easy reservation. Read on to find out why....

As with most Vegas establishments, none of the staff seemed very interested in being there. No genuine smiles. The hostess could care less. Our waiter was rude. We asked him for a pic and he turned us down at the time and promised to do it before we left. He never offered and we had to remind him when the check came. But by that time, it was dark and the restaurant was crowded so we didn't get a good picture. Sad since we were in town to celebrate a big milestone birthday, which our waiter was aware of.

As for the food, only 3 out of the 5 dishes were good. Don't bother with the oysters (from Washington State; really muddy and tasteless) or seafood. Stick with the pasta dishes. Veal gnocchi was delicious. They also brought our drinks to us late...after we were done with our second dish. Someone else also mentioned that they pushed the food on them pretty fast. Like they're trying to rush you outta there.

Was the meal/experience worth $200? Big fat no. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We are locals and we sat at bar with Regina as our server and host.
Food yummie. Came here 2 nights in a row because so impressed and wanted to try items not eaten night prior. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I brought my girl friend here for her birthday and we had a great view just right by the window where you can see the fountain.

We ordered yummy passion fruit mojito cocktails that came with real passion fruit. Great drink. It was more than our entree! We ordered the short rib entree and seafood risotto. The portions are very small, so if you came for a light dinner before a night out, this is the perfect spot for that. We also ordered two desserts which were pretty big portions and very delicious."}
{"text":"When my friend saw a photo I took from my table she said \"what you're in Paris?!\" (Jokingly said of course!) I was there for a conference and my mother was my lovely dinner date for the night. I made reservations that requested a table on the patio with unobstructed views of the fountains (they have space heaters, so you won't be cold outside), but there are only two tables like that and we'd have to wait a while. Honestly, we came for the ambiance not the food knowing that we could get better Italian somewhere else. So, I guess the slight disappointment on my face showed because a gentleman at the front desk took the minute to study the screen and ask the server to put us at table #x. He said it's even better because we won't be cold and it's a direct middle view. We were not disappointed. I've posted a photo of it. Just wonderful. 

The service in the dining room was somewhat lacking. Our waiter kept kicking my bag that was on the floor close to my chair multiple times without saying sorry or offering to move it. He also came back every two seconds to ask what we wanted even though we had just sat down. 

Ah, the food. No bread basket. What?! At an Italian restaurant? We were told that everything on the menu was tapas style meaning for two people we should order at least 4 dishes. Okay. But, the Spaghetti di fruti di mare that consists of two small bites for my 105 lb mother is $38?  Okay. It was good. Not great. All in all, for $130 for two people, the experience was worth the first time and the food, while not the French laundry, was fine. You're in Vegas after all."}
{"text":"Food was delish & gorgeous outdoor seating. However, I spoke to the restaurant when I made the reservation, and again 5 minutes prior to arrival, to remind them who I wanted to receive the priceless menu (my guest). I described what my guest was wearing to avoid any confusion. We arrive and...my guest is given the menu with prices. It ruined the meal as she was so concerned about the prices that it took away from the pleasure of the evening for us both! There were only two of us and I gave excellent reminders and notifications, but this restaurant still managed to screw up. Shameful."}
{"text":"Great view - you could enjoy fountain!!
Food - nothing outstanding 
Services - friendly server 

All in all, I might not visit LAGO again but you are not being picky on food quality it is still a place with great view."}
{"text":"The venue is spectacular...very bright..lots of color and a great view of the Bellagio Fountains from most every seat in the restaurant.

The food and the service are equally amazing.

It is an energized and exciting restaurant that we will return to again and again."}
{"text":"Had the brunch. It's 3 hours later I am still full. I had the Chicken Florentine my husband got the steak. Holy moly this was so good. The steak was perfect. The chicken wonderful. This was a 3 course meal. My husband had a Mac cheese with  prosciutto I had  bruschetta as our first course Delicious! 
We ordered bottomless mimosa's. They were an art experience. Almost to pretty to drink. Then the desserts seriously this is an artist making theses items. 
All in front of the fountains. The view is so breathtaking. Frank our waiter was a pleasant person. 
Now the only thing that bothered me. Why go to this beautiful restaurant and spend your whole time looking at your phone. People look up your missing so much. We were sitting looking and talking to each other I started looking from my seat at the show. Than noticed a couple looking at there phone the who time. They weren't the Only people. It makes me sad how much people depend on there phones for entertainment. 
All in all loved this place. Go but leave your phone on your purse or pockets."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. I was so excited to try this place, and really wanted to make sure we were close to the fountains as that was the primary reason I chose this restaurant. I left comments when making the reservation and they seated us RIGHT next to the window! It was amazing!

We ordered drinks which were so unique and delicious, and some of the best food we have ever tasted.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I made it clear to the waiter that it was my boyfriends birthday, and while several other people in the restaurant were recognized for having birthdays, he wasn't which was disappointing. Also, we were really disappointed with one of the dishes (the asparagus), and when we told the waiter, he didn't even apologize or take it off the bill. Considering the amount we spent, I felt the service could have been better.

Overall, we had a great time and a delicious meal. We'll come back, but will hopefully have a different waiter."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and views!!  Also I found the value to be pretty good for the quality of the food and service. 

Dined here recently on two separate work trips. The restaurant has an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain from the inside. The restaurant even queues the music to match the fountain when it is going. 

The food itself is wonderful. I really liked the gnocchi dish and found it to be delicious. All mainly small plates to great for sharing. Service is also good. Had servers both times that were attentive but not too much lingering. 

Hit this place up for sure when dining in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"And the winner is Moonlight!  Wait!  That's a mistake!  The Real winner is, La La Lago! 
Located inside the Bellagio Hotel near the North Entrance.  This chic Italian inspired restaurant, for me, is one of the all around best restaurants I've experienced in Vegas.  Lago is deserving of all 5 stars. 

One for its Service.  A star-studded performance by the staff on each and every one of my visits.  Always pleasant, always attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu(what a concept huh).   

One for its remarkable Visuals.  Lago décor is one of beauty.  This sleek stylish design with its breathtaking panoramic center-stage views of the Fountains of Bellagio, will surely elevate the level of your experience.  They do have a patio seating area that's even more impressive.  

One for its uplifting Spirits.  Innovation in creating the most refreshing and flavorful PASSIONFRUIT MOJITO I ever had.  The smooth operator CARAJILLO with its Licor 43 & Espresso combo making it a perfect after dinner drink.  This drink's companion is a dark chocolate spoon, meant for stirring licking or nibbling, whichever satisfies your current mood.  Top billing on the Lago Mixology Collection is LAGO COCKTAIL.  A unique and impressive cast of ingredients which you can have made sweet or spicy.  I've only tried and enjoyed the spicy, where Cayenne pepper was used.  Also, making a special cameo appearance by the ROSSO BELLINI, what a diva.   

One for its exceptional Food.  Anyone who knows me, knows I love a table full of food.  Lago has some of the most fascinating tapas.  Thanks to Julian Serrano's creations, my table has always been full. 
Starting off with the complimentary OLIVE BREAD, which I must say was FUC'n amazing. 
Want raw beef?  If you do and don't mind it thin, then you'll love CARPACCIO DI MANZO...tender, moist and flavorful.  Succulent pieces of meat you'll want to put in your mouth.  The SCALOPPINA DI VITELLO (veal piccata) thin, tender and flavorful as well. 
For you Seafood lovers.  The TOTANO RIPIENO (grilled shrimp stuffed squid),
SALMONE (both sashimi & cooked), POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO (octopus with squid ink cous cous), HAMACHI (yellowtail), CAPASANTA (scallops, blood orange, and pistachio), are equally spectacular in their own way.  The CAPASANTA ALLA PUTANESCA (scallops, tomatoes, boquerone sauce) were FUC'n amazing!  The '7 & 7' was dish was orgasmic, for you food porn lovers.  This extremely tender Potato Gnocchi with the Lobster Knuckles will surely please your senses.  Look at the pic.  I'm sure you'll wanna taste.     

One final star goes to Lago's drop dead gorgeous Desserts.  I was not only impressed with the taste, but also the plating and composition of ingredients of the desserts I've tried already.  The AMALFI is a Lemon Tart with Limoncello Sorbet and Passion Fruit coils.  The MATTONELLA AL CICCOLATO is a Flourless Chocolate Sponge Cake with Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate gelato, and Chocolate sauce.  Even though the CRÈME BRÛLÉE has a different consistency, texture, taste, I still found it to be perfect for my palate.  I enjoyed the TIRAMISU which was presented differently, deserving of an honorable mention.  Finishing this sweet list off with a happy ending, GIADUIOTTO, My Favorite.   

The Staff, Visuals, Cocktails, Food, and Desserts, all working in unison, for a complete climatic dinning experience, and all deserving of the 'Red Carpet' treatment. 

I will be returning for more happy endings!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go for fine dining (Italian style tapas) but the food itself did not justify the price point. I was expecting to be wowed by their food but it was pretty mediocre. Also sucks cause we came here to celebrate my dads bday and left unsatisfied. 

Zucca Allo Zenzero - One of the few dishes that actually was very good, it was a summer squash puree with ginger and spicy croutons for some added crunch

Bruschetta Al Pomodoro - Came with 4 pieces, the crostini it came on was crisp but chewy in the center. The diced tomatoes were light and refreshing and it was topped of with a drizzle of garlic oil and basil

Carpaccio Di Manzo - Served with big flat crackers and was kind of hard to eat since the raw beef was covered in arugula and parmesan (the shaved slices were too big and overpowering) we couldn't see that the beef wasn't in precut serving sizes it was basically just 2 or 3 really big ones laying on the plate so when you went to pick up some beef at first all of it pretty much came off the plate and onto your fork 

Polio E Fregola Al Nero - The octopus was the best part of this dish it was sooo soft and probably the best octopus I've ever had but the squid ink couscous was so salty 

Carciofi Granchio - The crab was very sweet and went well with the artichoke 

Brasato D'anatra - Braised duck was tender but the cheese polenta it was served with was so overpowering all I could taste was the cheese"}
{"text":"I have to say the price is large and portions are small. And if i didn't sit on the balcony i cant say the review would be the same. But the water show view and sitting outside(the misters are very nice) is amazing. The service was really good. ( we were there at 7pm aug 15th) The 2 gnocchi's on the menu are to die for. I get a chubby thinking about em. Seriously, as i write this! So good! The filet is pricey-but so tender and delicious. I highly recommend the patio. It was my bday so we got a free desert as well. We will def go back. As long as we get the patio:-) Service & food=very good experience!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting overlooking the fountains but frankly the service and food is disappointing for the price point. Careless service and presentation drive this down. There are much better restaurants for the price"}
{"text":"I had the short ribs and it was really tasty. Also I had the hazelnut dessert, which was amazing. 
The view from this restaurant is amazing and you can see the light show very well. 
I didn't have a reservation but the staff was really nice and gave me a nice table. Also the server was really friendly and informative."}
{"text":"I've always had great experiences dining at Lago. The food is good and so is the service! I definitely recommend the lobster gnocchi. They have a fantastic selection of wine as well!"}
{"text":"This place will always be my favorite in Vegas! Best view of the Bellagio fountain, Paris hotel and the strip! Food and service are always on point! Offered us complimentary dessert for my birthday and it was just perfect! Thank you guys, you never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Really an excellent restaurant with fabulous choices. My fault for ordering an appetizer that was special for $40 without realizing I was ordering a $40 appetizer.  Wine selection was fabulous.  Mozzarella out of this world but again way too much.  $100 lunch later I guess I still give it a 4 star."}
{"text":"Great dinner spot just inside the Bellagio. Make reservations and ask to for seats on the patio. These seats and basically on top of the Bellagio fountain and provide an amazing view. It can get busy so if you can do an early dinner you will have a better chance of getting one of the few outdoor seats. Beyond the view, the food is amazing as well."}
{"text":"For the money one of the worst places to eat in Vegas.   Food taste decent but portions are incredibly small.  After spending $130 for two people had to go out to dinner a second time the same night.  Will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome service, great food. Shoutout to Adam for making us feel like home"}
{"text":"Stopped by for an espresso. quick service, attentive baristas, cleaned environment. 

Plenty of seats inside, small menu though."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Gorgeous! 
And delicious. 

It is the food equivalent to Prada. The decor is literally out-of-this-world. Everything was sooooo good from start to finish!!!

Each plate is like a little piece of art. And each one more delicious than the next! Gnocchi was my favorite dish. Chef Serrano knows his Italian. 

Lago offers the best view of the Bellagio fountains in my opinion, with beautiful floor to ceiling windows.

Put this restaurant on your to-do list ASAP! 
You will thank me later. (You're welcome, in advanced)"}
{"text":"Wow. I walked in here not expecting much but was surprised over and over again. The mojito had the most amazing passion fruit puree in the shape of salmon roe and was so delicious that the server saw that I like it and brought two more! (not mojitos, the puree roe). The Caeser looked okay but was actually amazing and it had a wonderful helping of white anchovies on the side (I absolutely love anchovies!). The linguine was really, really good but didn't blow me away but the damn dessert did (it was some chocolate thing that the waiter recommended). I was in and out in 45 minutes with a big smile on my face. Did I mention this place looks out on the fountains? You have to get one of those seats as the fountain show makes this place 2-3 times better."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and scene - come dressed up (everyone else is), bring a friend to share with (it is Tapas style) and be patient (it will be packed)"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Lago in our recent trip to Vegas we made reservations 2 nights before plan ahead it can get busy. The food and drinks are awesome. Before leaving the chefs talked to us and asked us how the food was and recommended next time we visit in the night for dinner. Lago had an excellent view as well. Thank you for the great experience see you on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a lovely even here last night before going to the \"O\". Meals are served as prepared and portions are just - more than enough for 1. That is, you can safely order an appetizer, entree, and dessert without breaking the bank or your waist belt, plus share with your guests.  Almost all tables have a view of the Bellagio's fountain shows.  Service was excellent.  Save room for a dessert that is artistic as it is tasty!"}
{"text":"If Lolita across the street is where the young hip folks go eat, Lago is where you go if you want a quieter meal and that generally means a more mature clientele. The biggest issue is with the service. They seemed understaffed so we waited a long time between courses. The food though was delicious, had carpaccio to start then lamb chops and pork chop as main meal. The lamb was done beautifully and paired well with the sides. The pork chop, while also good, wasn't great mostly because I think we were thrown off by the Latin influence of the dish rather than an Italian influence. Ended with the olive oil cake which was so so. Would visit again but probably not in my go to restaurant list."}
{"text":"What a treat!!!  The food is creative, delicious and beautifully presented. About the only thing better than the food is the outstanding service.  When in Vegas give this place a try - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 5-year wedding anniversary at Lago this past Saturday.  I had very high expectations from this restaurant and chef and found it to be good, not great.  Firstly, we made a request for outdoor patio seating and we did not receive it.  I understand that the patio is small and that outdoor seating is not guaranteed, but it is unfortunate when a couple checks in with the hostess after us, admits they are 30 mins late to their reservation without calling, apologies for their mistake, and then get rewarded with super nice patio seating.  

Inside, the restaurant was absolutely full and buzzing with loud dance music.  If you are looking for a romantic ambiance, this is not it.  People are dressed very casually and there doesn't seem to be a dress code.  Many were in shorts and flip flops, and the guy sitting next to us looked like he just came back from a run, decked out in his jogging gear.  Awkward! 

Service was the lowest point.  Our waiter was hurried, unfriendly, the whole evening felt rushed, and very rarely came to check on us.  He did give us the helpful tip that we should order as we saw necessary as the plates came out tapas-style.  All in all, he wasn't very friendly. 

The food was also good, not great.  My favorite was the cannelloni short ribs and the spec pizza.  The rapini was very plain and the ricotta with honey can very easily be replicated at home.  Just a piece of focaccia with honey and cheese smeared on top.  

All in all, a good restaurant but if you are looking for something really exquisite to celebrate a very special occasion, this may not be your first choice."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, and fantastic views! Snag an outdoor seat if possible to catch the water show and picturesque views. The food was amazing, but definitely on the smaller side. I got full off of 2 items, but ordering several and sharing is definitely recommended. We personally really enjoyed the seafood risotto!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, fresh unique without being weird. Pizzas are fresh and delicious. Gnocchi is delightful. Service is excellent. Desserts are perfect.
  We had a table by the fountains and the meal took 1 hour 45 minutes. Could have lingered longer but they had a large party taking the patio."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time.   Great food and service 
The manager went beyond great service to make sure our experience was wonderful.  She helped us with trying to use a coupon that we had a hard time getting to validate.   Food was really good"}
{"text":"Armed with a $125 food & beverage certificate courtesy of Bellagio received at the An Evening at Lago Gold Badge Yelp Elite Event, and this time with another couple in tow, Diane and I returned to Lago for a repeat performance.  And the dining experience was just as spectacular the second time around.

Once again we were seated on the restaurant patio, with an exceptional view of the dancing Bellagio Fountains and Paris' Eiffel Tower just across the way.  Service was impeccable from our omnipresent server Denise, and the food we ordered was sublime.  My party shared several small plates.

I began with fresh complimentary Cranberry Buns, a hot bowl of Pasta Fagioli e Cozze with PEI Mussels and Tubetti Pasta, a high heap of delightful Salumi and Flatbread, and Cesare Salad with Baby Romaine, a Ciabatta Crouton, and a delicate Caesar Anchovy Dressing.  Tonno Crudo was ultra-fresh, and a Honey Bun adorned with Alla Ricotta e Mile sweet and enjoyable.  Salumi was fresh, nicely varied, and a fine starter.

More substantial fare included tasty Striped Bass Entero, yummy Cannelloni, excellent plump Gamberi, delicious Potato Gnocchi with Lobster Knuckles, and juicy Filet Mignon cooked medium and served with delectable Roasted Potatoes.  

For dessert we enjoyed delicate Tiramisu, Chocolate Hazelnut Mattonella, refreshing Chocolate Gelato, and for me great Decaf.  This was a great super-fine meal, and the excellent consistency in food, service, and ambiance between the two outings was noteworthy.  There is ample reason why acclaimed chef Julian Serrano's newest gem of a restaurant is currently one of the hottest dining spots in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"celebrated my bday here!

definitely get a table on the patio for a view of the fountains. trust me, it will be worth it.
thank you to manda bear who recommended this spot - our group of ladies instantly fell in love. you are the best!

our night started with a photo op with chef julian serrano who greeted all of us and even posed for a photo. we were quickly seated and checked on by our server fabio and the GM also named fabio.

i also loved our sommelier as i wanted to pick a tasty wine that was affordable since the ladies were treating me to a great meal. the wine menu has some solid and varied options that were familiar to me. the sommelier convinced me to try something new and boy was i happy we did.

loved, loved, loved our attentive server fabio. he seemed so genuine in his recommendations on what he liked and we got to try quite a few dishes which included his favs.

highlights were the burrata and the crab salad for appetizers. the risottos were also amazing whether it was the mushroom or the seafood risotto. yes, the dishes were on the smaller side compared to the all you can eat buffets but they were in fact the norm in europe. 

the desserts were tasty-tasty but my fav was the hazelnut. their desserts are a surefire instagram friendly moment or just close your eyes and enjoy the moment. don't close your eyes for too long lest you want to miss the water show. cheers!"}
{"text":"Was it good? Sure. Was it memorable for the price? absolutely not. Mussels were small in size and quantity. Whole lobster garganelli good but not worth $55. There are better places for same price on Strip. Heck I think Olives has better food IMHO.

They forgot our soup order. It happens, but frankly a place like this with a notable chef? It's a no-no. Too bad. I really can't recommend when other Italian places in LV for same price is much more competitive."}
{"text":"All I have to say is...WOW ..
If you're looking for an Italian restaurant You'll find the best food over there.Great service and an awesome place to take your loved ones or family members.
I'd give 10 starts if I could!"}
{"text":"Not real Italian food.  Overpriced.  Don't do it.  Service great and wine by the glass is more like a tasting. That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"At least it was better than Olive Garden and cheaper than I expected but rather pedestrian food.  Dining by the fountains didn't suck.  My server also didn't suck, she was a delightful young lady who will go far in this industry."}
{"text":"wow... speachless, mr julian serrano himself went out of his way to order me an item from the dinner menu for lunch!! best branzino in town... everything served in share portions so order everything."}
{"text":"Brunch was amazing! For only $38 per person this is a great value. Your Brunch begins with a pastry basket, followed by two courses and finally a desert bar! We selected Raviolone which is stuffed with egg and truffles and my daughter loved it! I had the salmon salad followed by the Frittata which was scrumptious. The service aaa also excellent and the best part is the view of the Fountain show! It was stunning! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to the Sunday brunch. The waffles were so hard and crispy they were more crackers. The heat lamps did not keep the food warm. Service was mediocre.The staff was pleasant but not efficient. No flavor. I certainly won't be back unless it is to sit outside and enjoy the passer-bys. But I won't get the sangria...... It really sux."}
{"text":"They just opened.  Don't know, how long they will last.  They are in perfect location, looking out to the Bellagio fountains.  Food is just average.  Overpriced like all Bellagio restaurants.  However, we are willing to pay for over-priced if they are good Italian.  There are a lot better Italian Restaurant at Las Vegas then Lago.

Furthermore, I can't believe that Bellagio eliminated their Fountains Sunday Brunch and repplace it with Lago's 3-course Brunch.  Tried itthis morning (9/6/15).  It's not worth it.  I would definetly go to Mandarin Oriental or Wynn's Sunday Jazz Brunch from now on.  Eliminating Fountains Brunch will be one of the biggest mistake that Bellagio have made."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with two others..we all three loved it!  We each got a different dish and shared - all three were excellent.  I had the Penne - so good; the Vegetable Lasagna was the best I'd ever tasted; and the Chicken Francese was light and flavorful with great vegetables.  We got the Brie as an appetizer - really, really good.  The three desserts - Pistachio Mousse, Chocolate with mallow and Bread Pudding of the day - were also good, although the Bread Pudding was a little heavy on cinnamon. 

The wait staff were very friendly and helpful.  The setting is lovely, both inside and out.  We sat on the patio and could watch the traffic and see the skyline, without feeling like you were sitting on the sidewalk. 

Our only complaint was that the kitchen was slow that evening, which the waiter indicated was unusual.  However, it was so lovely, we didn't mind.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many of the new restaurants on the East Bank of the Flats, so I decided to take my mom here a couple of weeks ago. What a letdown.

What surprised me the most were the prices. Yelp has them listed as $11-30, but when we showed up for lunch I would say most of the menu items were around $25-40, per plate. They don't even offer you a side salad or some freshly baked bread while you're waiting for your meal. 

One other major complaint, the menu seemed VERY small. Whenever I glance over a menu at any restaurant I can usually narrow my choices down to about two or three entrees, and then I'm left struggling with the mouthwatering decision of which one sounds the best. That wasn't the case here. I was hoping for a wide variety of unique Italian style entrees but instead they included items like a hamburger and salmon, which I can get anywhere. 

We both settled on the Lobster Gnocchi. I thought it was just ok, lacked the 'wow' factor; my mother on the other hand wasn't impressed at all. She came with a big appetite and left without even finishing her meal.

2 plates with coffee, tea, & tip came to about $100. I don't mind paying top dollar for delicious food, but the menu just did not impress us.

I normally don't like to write negative reviews on Yelp because I like to give every business the benefit of the doubt. You never know, the chef could be having an off night or the server could be going through some personal issues that day. As for Lago, the staff was friendly and professional, and the ambience was top notch! However, when it came to what really matters, the food, we were both very disappointed. 

Good coffee though.

Most of the reviews on here are positive so I'm hoping that this was just a fluke experience. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back to find out."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get.  Portions are small, bill is big.  Menu options are also limited.  Nice atmosphere but you will leave hungry (and broke)"}
{"text":"I had an incredibly enjoyable evening at Lago.

When my wife and I were first seated, I requested the wine list. I have to admit, I am not a big wine drinker. I know what styles I like but not winemakers, regions, and so one. When I realized how long the list was, I nearly fainted!

The sommelier quickly made his way over and man, what an awesome guy! He was able to relate what type I beer I like to drink to the wine list. He inquired about budget, which was nice, and found us a nice bottle from a region that he was particularly fond of.

I am sad to say, that bottle was gone in 30 minutes. It was that good! We liked it so much that the sommelier picked us out another follow up bottle after the first one disappeared.

I also enjoyed that the sommelier was able to recommend pairings for the wine as well. For the first bottle, he recommended a delicious sausage pasta. For the second bottle, he recommended some Spanish meats.

Besides the wine, the food was delicious. The good did make it to the table quickly, so I recommend spacing out your order..

I highly recommend Lago. It was one of my favorite meals in the States."}
{"text":"Awful, rancid food that made me sick immediately and inevitably gave food poisoning. Came for Brunch, ambience just OK. Dishes tasted reheated and rotten. Could not eat and complained to waitress who told me I could go to the dessert bar. Cheap cakes and food that has been hanging around for ages. Brunch is a scam here, don't waste your time and fall for the views."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Lago for the first time in June 2011. It was a Wednesday night around 8:00 p.m. and we were able to be seated right away, outdoors, which is what we preferred. The ambiance was quiet and the sky/sunset was beautiful that night, so we were looking up at it a lot. The outdoor seating is a little small, but it was perfect for us. It took the waitress a little while to come over to us, and so I gave this review 4 stars -- it seemed like the entire evening it took the waitress a long time to get to us. Maybe it's because we were outside, I'm not sure. There was a larger party of 6 people at another table outside, but other than that, it was not crowded out there. When we arrived, I noticed a table of two women sitting and waiting to pay their bill at the end of their meal. They seemed a little exasperated with the service at that point, so I kind of knew what to expect. Our waitress was very nice that evening, I just think they may have been short staffed or something. Also, I noticed  a group event going on in the private event room inside of Lago (the group of about 30 people arrived AFTER we did and were finished with their meal or whatever they were doing in there BEFORE we left that night). I think this contributed to our food taking a long amount of time to arrive. I timed it and I think it was 45 minutes from when our appetizers arrived to when the dinner entrees were on the table. I realized that the food is absolutely AMAZING at Lago, but even that is too long for me to wait for food. It was after 10:00 p.m. before we were out of there, and all we had were 2 drinks each, an appetizer, and 2 entrees. My fiance and I had the scallops as an appetizer (amazing!), I had the lobster gnocchi (would definitely recommend this to anyone! It was delicious!), and he had the pan roasted halibut (he said it was good, but he would want to try the blackened walleye next time). For drinks, I think my fiance had beer. I had the watermelon mojito, but I wasn't that impressed with it, so on the second round I got the Caribbean Royale, which was awesome. I would definitely go back to Lago! It was a pricey night for the two of us, so we will only go for special occasions, or maybe we will try their happy hour one night."}
{"text":"The food at Lago is very good. It's tapas style, therefore, the portions aren't very big but what you do get is very good! We really enjoyed the view of the fountains. However, the service we received was poor. We were ignored at our table we had to call for the server when we needed more water, when we wanted to place our order, etc. At one point one of the hostess was near our table and I asked her if she could take a picture of my boyfriend and I and she said she didn't have time. I am giving it a 3 star rating only because the food was good and so was the view."}
{"text":"The view from the waterside tables is spectacular and is worth coming here just for that. 

We had excellent friendly service. But the food was just good. Nothing to write home about and nothing that I thought about at night making wonder how I can get back there for more. 

So I wouldn't refuse to go here but I wouldn't say hey let's go to Lago. 

If you're staying at the  Bellagio It's worth going to. But not worth making a special trip for."}
{"text":"Amazing! A fabulous dinner expertly served by Donovan. On the GoTo Vegas list. See you in November Lago!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty and if you're lucky enough to get one of their better tables, you will have a nice view of the fountains & water show. The food was good but most of the portions were small. I really liked the mushroom risotto. The bruschetta was also pretty good. The linguine al pesto was good but I couldn't eat a lot of it - maybe order this to share."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant!! My family and I spent the weekend in Las Vegas for a family birthday and stayed at the Bellagio. We had planned on eating at Lago because we had heard it was phenomenal. We had a group of 9 and our server asked us if we wanted to order on our own or if we wanted him to make us up a menu of the most popular items off of each of the sections on the menu. We opted to have him make us up a menu and let me tell you, it did not dissapoint. Every single thing that we tried was absolutely mouth watering. By far one of the best Italian meals I have ever had. All 9 of us left the restaurant completely stuffed!! My family and I are from Sonoma County in California and I wish there was a Lago around here so we could all go there again!"}
{"text":"Lago is a true highlight in the Las Vegas dining experience. Although my family has dined here frequently, this was my first time and it did not disappoint. 
We were greeted by the maitre'd upon check in and suggested to us to sit outdoors on the heated patio. The suggestion was spot on. There were enough heat lamps to make me warm although it was 45° outside and the view was spectacular. The fountains are directly in front of the dining area so one should try to sit on the patio. 
The food is meant to be shared plates so order accordingly. It really does give everyone the opportunity to try a little of everything. 
We started with orders of small foccacia; one  with fave been purée and pork cheek and the other was pecorino and green olive. Both were a great start to the meal to follow. 
The scallop crudo with blood orange is so light yet bursts with so much flavor.
The 7&7 is a must try. 7 gnocchi with lobster in a light sauce is perfect. 
Spaghetti with Clams in tomato sauce was heavenly as were the Clams in a spicy white wine.
The surprise for me was the Risotto in red wine and burrata. Very rich yet the burrata was a perfect compliment. 
The service was extremely attentive as was the sommelier. 
A definite recommendation for anyone in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What I have found is any restaurant in a high end property owned by a \" celeb chef\" in Vegas will be over priced and Largo small plates and big prices is an example of that. We had the mushrooms, Chipollini pizza, shrimp ravioli and beef cannelloni and all were good. Sent back the caponata as there was 2 small pieces of eggplant a lot of carrots and yellow squash making it a tasteless mix veggie dish being called caponata. Considering where you are it is worth a try. Check the bill as 2 of the 5 food items we had were over charged $1.00 from the menu price on a big party that will add up."}
{"text":"Our dinner at Lago made our Las Vegas trip!! First off, I heard through online reviews that this place was the place to be to see the amazing fountains at Bellagio, and it certainly was. The view is perfect! We were celebrating our engagement and I wrote this on my reservation and requested a window table. When we arrived, I was promptly greeted and \"congratulated\" on our engagement, which was such an attentive gesture, as they actually read the \"notes!\" We were led to the best table in the house, along the window in the middle - the best view of the fountains! Because it was 4th of July weekend, the fountains seemed to go off every 10 minutes, more often than usual after 8pm. The food was amazing also. Everything was PERFECTLY seasoned and PERFECTLY cooked. I tend to enjoy food that could be over-seasoned as well, and Lago was just right, not too seasoned or salty, but highlighted the ingredients in the dish. Notable selections were (well, all dishes were great!!!) 7 & 7, the lobster gnocchi which had a sort of pumpkin/squash sauce that you lapped up with a spoon, the truffle risotto special - with tons of sliced truffles on top and a perfectly cooked risotto with lots of white wine (?) flavor - great consistency on the risotto (not watery at all, but not to thick) as most restaurants miss this mark!! We also had the stuffed calamari, which focused on the flavor of the calamari and shrimp stuffing, perfectly seasoned and cooked. We also ordered the braised duck over tasty cheese polenta, which was amazing. We don't particularly love polenta, but this was really tasty and had a good cheese and perfectly salted flavor. Finally, we were brought a surprise dessert, a small banana cream cheesecake to share and they had written \"Congratulations\" on the plate! It was such a surprise and I was so thankful for their attention to our special occasion! Thank you Lago!!! Can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok this is a good as it gets!

Beautiful and stunning !!! THE most professional crew in Vegas.. Albert is awesome and takes very good care of his patrons... everyone is treated first class.

Food was incredible, we went tapas style and the plates just kept coming out of the kitchen...each one was awesome... Then the desert marathon began....wonderful creations..almost too beautiful to eat..almost!

Hint: Don't order off the menu..ask the Waiter or Manager to take care of you...thats all you need.."}
{"text":"The food at Lago is definitely five stars! I've never ordered anything that wasn't top notch! The first time I went there, I ordered the branzino livornese. I loved it! The only other time I've had branzino was at Bardot brasserie and theirs was terribly bland! The one at Lago is definitely more flavorful! I took a bite out of my friend's dish which was the Crusted Salmon and oh my, that was is also bursting with flavors! If you want to order a fish, I would definitely go for either of those two!

My second time around, I went with their three course tasting menu and ordered the caprese salad, Petto di pollo ripieno, and the hazelnut cake. My friend ordered the tonno and the anatra e polenta. The caprese salad was yummy! The tomatoes were fresh and so was the cheese. It had the perfect amount of saltiness. The chicken was a little overdone but still flavorful! The mashed potatoes that came with it was amazing! It was creamy and the sauce on it was just yums! No words could explain it. My friend's duck dish was also delicious! If you had shrimp and grits, it's kind of similar. I would want to order it next time. The two desserts I've tried is the hazelnut cake and the panna cotta and both are exceptionally delicious! 

So the jist of it all, everything was flavorful and delicious. Docking off one star because I literally had to hunt down just to get a water refill and that's my biggest pet peeve. You should always keep the waters and drinks filled. 

Oh well! I will definitely be coming back in the near future. 




ANATRA E POLENTA"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere not stuffy. Accident on 77 so we were running late and they held our reservation. Thx   Service was good, waiter was timely and helpful. My wife and I shared the Linguini and clams and lago burger.  The linguini sauce was excellent; not too overdone or overpowering. The pasta and clams complimented well together. The lago burger was a decent burger. The Italian beer selection was pretty good also. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Tho restaurant has a very nice food we had the duck the pizza and cannelloni their dishes are nice but the portion are you kidding everybody came out starving . The price is for a full plate so this i s not a good place to eat . I want to say that the manager came to explain about the small portions and what he said is that what you expect for a $ 20 .00 entree ? You got be kidding I expect a full entree . If you wanna be starving after dinner come here....."}
{"text":"It was fancy, nice atmosphere, great view of the fountains water show at bellagio, but to be all honest there were a couple of really great dishes but everything else was just ok.  I thought the sashimi didn't taste very fresh, had a hint of fishiness.  Our bill which included two $150 bottles of wine, some drinking at the table of 10, but not excessive...came out to $160 per person.  I didn't think it was worth it..."}
{"text":"excellent small plates and amazing views of the bellagio fountains! :) highly recommend the carpaccio / the white truffle pasta / scallop crudo / polenta and lamb dishes - very very good!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a fantastic view and aren't a fan of heights, look no further. The Bellagio fountains are one of Las Vegas's most romantic shows. At Lago it feels like you can reach out and touch the fountains while in a well lit energizing atmosphere. I had the 8oz. Fillet with asparagus and potatoes. I would recommend it to anyone. The food is great and the view even better!"}
{"text":"Actually very please with this place. We came here with a big group for a celebratory dinner and even with so many people, the service was pretty good. My friend and I split the 14 oz steak and added lobster on top, which they flame grill in front of you and it was so good! The appetizer salad was great too! Would come here again! I posted a picture but it's blurry because it was a screen shot from my snapchat."}
{"text":"Get ready to be blown away by Lago? Such a classy and sexy restaurant. And what a view! By far the best spot in Las Vegas or anywhere else in that matter. Aside from its exquisite aesthetic, Lago exudes such a young, hip and lively energy. As expected, the staffs, the service and the food are top notch. Everyone from managers to servers to bar tenders are professional and pleasant. As for food, the meatballs, braised short ribs & grilled octopus are highly recommended. Lamb ragu pasta is amazing. Another must have is the Salumi platter. Love the rosemary porchetta. Yum. If you're a pizza lover like myself, the margherita won't disappoint. The dough is light, fluffy and full of flavor. Can't wait to try other dishes. So many dishes but so very little tummy!!! Bye Lago. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was amazing! We choose it because of the view and the reasonable menu prices (not realizing it was tapas style). Our seat had an amazing view of the fountains that could not be beat! Our waiter recommended we order 3 or 4 plates a person but we are two small girls so opted to start with two to share and go from there. We had the bruschetta and the pesto pasta and both were delicious! We finished with the olive focaccia and that was filling enough for us! I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed that they don't make it clear the tables close to the fountains/patio are only available for those with a reservation - but with that being said, the food was unbelievably good. We went for brunch. Three courses for $38/each. Tried the antipasto and lasagna and had assorted desserts. Everything melts in your mouth. Super refreshing bellini, too. Will make a reservation next time so we have a view of the fountains. Great spot."}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant with a novel idea. An Italian joint that focuses on small tapas like plates. Smack dab in front of the Bellagio fountains this place already has the best ambience in Las Vegas. The staff was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. We picked 5 entrees. The fusilli with lamb ragu was great, my girlfriend isn't a big lamb fan and loved it. The duck with polenta, that could have caused a fight for the last of it, that's how god it was, great duck over creamy and cheesy polenta. The focaccia with ricotta and honey could have been a dessert, great and was essentially a cinnamon roll lol. We got the pesto but opted for the wider pappardelle noodles, great choice. The sausage pizza was amazing as well. They also brought us an amazing chocolate cake for celebrating our anniversary there. All in all great date night and perfect place to celebrate something special. Needless to say, don't go if you're cheap."}
{"text":"Beautiful dining experience, expensive but the food was outstanding and the fountains and our table were great.  We split 5 tapas items and the lemony dessert..Everything was delicious.  We also had a bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"Table by the window with a great view. We were seated before dark, so the impact of the fountain show was less than the max. Still, nice view of the water and Paris overall.
Drinks off the now standard iPad menu, all tasty and well prepared.
4 people ordered 9 plates to start. The lamb ravioli and 7 and 7 were the best so we got 2nd's on those.
Bread not included with meal, order and pay separately. Very unusual for Italian.
Did not do desserts but they looked good.
I know this review is not strong on specifics, but this is really a visceral experience that you need to try, and experiment with. 
Oh, and according to my wife it's too noisy. Personally the noise level adds a bit of theater and excitement for me."}
