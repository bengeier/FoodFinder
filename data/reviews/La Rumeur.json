{"text":"Great breakfast , always brings a doggie bag home. Good value for your money & service is great."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a friend who lives in Longeuil and is a regular here. It's a great 24 hour diner with extensive menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The breakfast menu is several pages of awesome and copious breakfast fare at super reasonable prices: large omelettes stuffed with veggies, meat, cheese (or a combo of all of the above); pancakes that are thinner than traditional ones yet not as thin as French crepes; traditional eggs and breakfast meat platters served with beans, fresh fruit, thick slices of toast, and skillet potatoes. You really cannot go wrong with the choices offered (and I can see this as an amazing place to eat, if hungover).   

I ordered le numero 4; it was two eggs your way (mine is always over easy), skillet potatoes, toast, fresh fruit and deli ham for $6CA. More than enough food and I didn't eat all of the toast (as tasty as it was). I loved the fact the potatoes were perfectly fried (not greasy) and the entire dish was lightly seasoned, so it's up the customer to add extra salt/pepper per their desire. 

Food comes fairly swiftly and correct temperature. 

Their OJ comes in a huge glass, which is awesome. I love a good glass of OJ with breakfast.

Our server Germaine was very nice and friendly. 

The place was hopping on a Saturday morning and the abundance of food on other tables shared amongst family members, friends and coworkers makes this place an affordable option."}
{"text":"I've came here twice, once for breakfast & the other time for a late night meal. We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria. The food was ok but not the best."}
{"text":"Not impressed everything tasted like a 5/10. Lasagna has 80% spaghetti 20% sauce. The sandwiches were not tasty at all."}
