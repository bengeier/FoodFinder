{"text":"The manager Jackie was EXTREMELY RUDE!!!    Went there with my husband and children..   Was charged $5.99 for something that clearly says $3.99 on the menu.   When I brought it to her attention she tells me that the menu the waitress gave me was old and she's not going to fix the price.    In addition to that...   My oldest son had hair in his food so he couldn't eat it and she refused to take it off my bill.   They even gave me a hard time about making a new order.    After arguing with me for 20 minutes...  She finally decided to have the cook make HALF the order.  Smh... Worst customer service EVER!!!!!  I never call to complain but I definitely did after this visit and I've been waiting to here back from corporate for 2 WEEKS!!! I will NEVER go to Shoney's again!!"}
{"text":"the food is ok. i went on a wednesday night for the breakfast buffet and the waitresses were ok- but the food was horrible. i had 3 pancakes and they were hard and the syrup was cold. one pancake i couldnt actually bite into. another thing is, the bacon had excess fat on it. i would not come back."}
{"text":"I like there buffet. But, the other reviews are on the money. As with other businesses you have you good and your bad days. My biggest problem was that the started closing the buffet at 8:00Pm. I usually dine there on Thursdays or Fridays. This particular Friday night I walked into the restaurant at 7:59Pm I was told after we were seated that the buffet was closed and the kitchen was not cooking menu items but only serving deserts. In amazement That this place would shut down on Friday before 8:00 I decided to leave.    The service has always been good to me. Food, tables and the buffet has always been clean. The food is reasonable for the price. Booths could use new seat coverings."}
{"text":"Actually, the food is pretty decent. The prices are very reasonable.  We've only been to the breakfast buffet a few times. 'Enjoyed ALL the basics, fresh battered chicken tenderloins, some kind of cobbler (nothing is titled), biscuits, 2 white gravy's, 2 French toast options, plus fruits, etc.  The environment is awful. Everything in eyesight is worn down. Even the patrons. 'Cant' believe we saw a girl in the clothes she slept in, & a nearby customer picking a fight over ordering juice, but the waitress did great avoiding the fight.  The staff was as nice as could be, and the restrooms were also as clean as could.be."}
{"text":"Horrible.  The food was flavorless and the chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  There weren't many choices at the bar. I felt like they should have had to pay me to eat there.  The service was okay,  until the waitress asked me if I wanted to leave a tip after I handed her my card. What?! Not at all, and thats for me to decide once I get the slip. To make matters worse, I got sick later that night from the food. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place is still in business!? How Sway how *Kanye voice* Shoneys is dying off altogether and this particular location should tell you why. The University area offers much better options. The last time I came here, I was so disappointed beyond words. The food was stale and cold. Definitely not worth a few dollars. Stay FAR away. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I was at Shoney's today for breakfast with 2 of my cousins and we had a delicious breakfast and set and reminisced for two hours! The waitress Cammi was extremely hospitable welcomed us and seated us in a view by the window! Which was nice watching the rain come down and enjoying the mood! Cammi continually checked on us to see if we needed anything! This is the kind of place you want to sit down, relax, and throw down comfortably and not fill rushed or ignored! So if you want a nice clean living atmosphere please go to Shoney's on North Tryon street for great service and delicious nutritious meal! Karen Houston"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place a while back  and you just know something is up when the place is empty midday. We ordered burgers and it was awful. Haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"The food was old and somewhat cold.  I did like the fact they had fried chicken, but it wasn't really worth it.  The place is old and not updated."}
{"text":"The food's okay for the buffet price, but be prepared for shoddy service, especially if it's busy.  Went for the Sunday morning buffet and experienced all of the following:   1) Wait staff seems to be overwhelmed with tables and frequently disappears for long periods of time.  2) Workers who restock the buffet can barely speak English and when you ask them about a food item that seems to be missing from the buffet they simply tell you that they don't have it and blow you off.  They don't even tell you that your waitress might be able to get you that item from the kitchen.  3) One of the hostesses has a real attitude on her and can barely contain her contempt for the customers.  I asked her specifically to find my waitress at one point and she never did.  I had to get up and find my waitress myself.  All in all this is a very poorly run establishment, which I blame on management for not having enough wait staff onsite during the busy hours, and also for not making sure that the hostesses and buffet workers communicate politely and effectively to the customers.  The waitresses seem to be doing their best but they are limited by the disorganization that is caused by management's inability to run a tight ship.  I'm sticking with Golden Corral from now on."}
{"text":"I was surprised this business was in existence.  I went for a meeting an wanted to order a single order of French toast.  I was told it is only available on the buffet.  Well that was a wrap for me.  I am glad our meeting is changing either way I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Location is a little run down, but it's Shoneys. You kind of get what you pay for.   Food is still decent, but not best quality.   One positive is you have a big variety!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst!  Woke up wanting a buffet breakfast, and this was the only option in my area.  Mind you, I've ate at Shoney's for years, but at different locations.  This was my first and last time ever going here.  The Orange Juice didn't taste like real juice.  I only ate 2 pancakes and some scrambled eggs.....Yuck!  I quickly put that plate to the side and try my hand at a salad...can't go wrong with making your own salad, right???  WRONG!!  The cucumbers tasted as if they hadn't been cleaned well....as if it still has that pesticide spray on it.  The salad plates were warm.....just an all around horrible experience that I never plan on having....ever again...EVER!"}
{"text":"I feel like a liar giving this place even 1 star. I would starve to death before I ever step foot in this \"restaurant\" again. It is filthy, smells like mold, the food is disgusting and the buffet is embarrassing. The booths are ripping apart and I was skeeved out just sitting there. There aren't enough words in the English language to describe what a terrible experience this was."}
{"text":"It's shoneys !!! The only one we have left !! Strawberry pie and breakfast bar :) as good as ever .. friendly staff !! It's awesome"}
{"text":"If you like crunchy pancakes and canned fruit and orange juice which contains zero oranges then this is the place for you. The breakfast buffet looked down right sad. Depressed. The food was being brought out as it was was prepared but tasted far from fresh. The only fresh fruit was pineapple cut in huge chunks. It was super sour. Not edible. Everything else from the apple sauce to the sliced peaches was reminiscent of dessert you would find at a nursing home. The staff was pretty nice. The food is super cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ewwwwww. As of August 21, 2017 their sanitation rating is a 86%. So, eat at your own risk. I came to this crap hole at 5something this morning to buy the eclipse glasses they advertised they would BEGIN selling at 6AM. I stood in line for over an hour. They open the doors, the employee (yes, ONE employee) seemed completely clueless. She said they sold the glasses yesterday. Problem is multiple people in line call yesterday afternoon and as late as closing time and were told that they would begin selling glasses at 6am today. This is some foolishness!"}
{"text":"This was bad and I'm mad I spent $30 for us to eat here. Don't go I wondered why the parking lot was empty I thought oh good no one's here oh boy there is a reason. The selection was so limited it was like a salad bar at any other restaurant it would have been ok but not at this price! Golden corral is $3 cheaper and 10 times the selection!! No desert no meat loaf even through it's in ads and picture on the wall.3 people were working there and 3 customers this won't last and I won't feel bad when they go under it's bad when there is 3 customers at dinner time on Saturday I'm mad at myself for being so stupid for going there the food was ok but I can stay home for a better time and meal"}
{"text":"I can only blame myself because I saw the very negative reviews. The food was mediocre at best, the servers were a bit awkward and kind of in the way , the tea was just ok, and the bar left a lot to be desired. As bad as the food was, I was able to stomach it. That was until I found a 1 inch long hair in my French toast. I informed the waitress of this and gave her my plate. She said she would talk with the kitchen staff about this and when she looked at the hair said nobody that works in the kitchen has hair like this, it had to have been somebody that went to the bar. I sat there a bit shocked as to what that had to do with anything. She asked if I wanted anything else and I told her I was done for the day. Of course my meal was not comped but I didn't expect that they would have the decency to do so. I could have spent that $12 on something a bit more appetizing. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the last Shoney's in Charlotte. I used to go there regularly for breakfast which lasted until 2pm and the food was good and a good variety, the restaurant was clean and staff was friendly and professional. Went there recently and the variety was very little and there was not much breakfast food even though they said breakfast lasted until 2. They start bringing out lunch foods at noon so they is breakfast and lunch foods but there was not a good variety of breakfast nor lunch foods. The restaurant was not clean, we had to have the waitress clean off the chairs before we sat down. I guess as someone else said, you get what you pay for and being that it's the last Shoney's in the city its going downhill and fast!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to Florida from Ohio. I was skeptical seeing how there's a bunch of bad reviews for the place. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet which we found fantastic. All you can eat bacon, ham, eggs, best of all, the best fried chicken I've ever had! The kids loved the French toast sticks with syrup. There was a few ceiling tiles with water damage but I didn't find it a big deal. Food was fresh, the waitress refilled our drinks as necessary. All is good in my opinion!"}
{"text":"The manager and waiter was great. They didn't have much business on the day that I went. The food have been sitting out for a while since there was no business but when I asked to for fresh food, the food was great. So I'll give a big shout out to the Manager and the cook"}
{"text":"This place is on its last leg. I think that Shoney's need to pull the plug on this joint like they did the others. My wife and I decided to try a special they advertised. Our first mistake was that we came too close to closing time. Food was cold at the bar and they packed up the food about 30 mins before they closed even though they advertised online that they closed at 10pm but this one closes at 9pm. Will I come back to this place? Nope...well maybe with a coupon for the breakfast bar"}
