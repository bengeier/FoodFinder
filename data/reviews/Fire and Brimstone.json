{"text":"This place has become our favorite pizza place in the east valley.  Their speciality Pizzas are just down right amazing.   Friendly staff, great location, nice patio, byob and a great brewery right there.  We love it!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Fire and Brimstone!  The atmosphere and staff are amazing.  This small local business sets itself apart by attention to detail and creative menu. Such a perfect addition to the area."}
{"text":"Part of the Barnone complex in Agritopia, this pizza place offers limited, tasty fare.  We got pizzas, shaksouka, and barrata salad to eat and beer from the small brewery next door.  The pizzas were quite delicious, thin crust and flavorful toppings cooked in a wood fired oven, and the shasouka was spicy, savory and earned a spot with dollaps ladled on our pizza.  The namesake Fire and Brimstone pizza was cooked chewy yet crispy, with hearty toppings that complemented the spiciness from jalapenos.  The heirloom tomato and barrata salad came encircled with balsamic dressing that added to the earthy flavors. The pizza, sides, and beer equalled a delicious meal.  We recommend giving Fire and Brimstone a try."}
{"text":"Amazing! My husband and I just had a little date night here and the food was so good. We got the Fire and Brimstone pizza (sausage, jalapeños, and cilantro) and the shakshuka. Everything tasted amazing, you could definitely tell the ingredients were top notch! This is going to be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Tasty. Ordered pizza and salad. Pizza was good- ordered well done and they did it right. Crispy with good chewy crust. Salad on the other hand was too small for the price. Beets with Beet greens. Good tasting but portion was for a child. Later we saw the same salad go by for someone else and it was easily twice the size.  They need to work on the consistency. How about adding a Caesar salad to the menu."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place with my husband and it didn't disappoint! The inside of Barnone is beautiful! I love the industrial look. It's a little hot during the AZ summer heat but it was ok. My husband had pizza and I had the farm salad both were really good and we will definitely be back. The menu isn't very big but they will deliver your food to you at the brewery or winery."}
{"text":"Woah, this place is amazing, killer food, friendly staff, and a warm and welcoming ambiance! I went to fire and brimstone last week and I'm already craving another one of their wood fired pizzas! We got the margarita pizza, daily special pizza and the beet salad. Everything tasted so fresh and all the flavors in the pizza came together perfectly! Also, an added bonus, there is a brewery just 5 steps away from fire and brimstone, so you can enjoy your pizza and beer all in one space! Oh and don't forget to finish your meal with a tasty pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! We got the fire and brimstone pizza and it was delicious! Fresh ingredients, very good pizza dough. Fun environment as well!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Monday during lunch. I had a Margherita Pizza with house-made lamb sausage. It came out very quickly (less than 10 minutes) and was fantastic. The sausage was very unique and had a little spice. I've had the pita and hummus before and it is tasty as well. The server brought a fork and napkins with the pizza and was very nice. Would recommend the pizza to anyone looking for a good wood-fired pizza!"}
{"text":"Love eating at Fire and Brimstone! The heirloom tomatoes with burrata is the best I have ever had anywhere and all their pizzas are incredible! The pizza dough has amazing flavor and surpasses any other pizza dough I have tasted. My favorite pizza is the Southwest Pacific and my favorite salad is the Wedge. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, hummus, and s'mores! Definitely a place I will keep coming back to!! Service has been perfect each time I've been there."}
{"text":"We were honestly disappointed. When you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? You can't drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza.. and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters..: with no ice. Seriously SO weird. I ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. The pizza was okay, the service was terrible.. nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up... we were disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been a few times already and I love the wedge salad and the Fire and Brimstone Pizza. Grab a Crowler from 12 West across the way or a bottle of Garage-East next door and you have a winning combo. Great place and love the environment"}
{"text":"Fresh, innovative, friendly and fantastic! Any combo of pizza they offer is fire roasted to perfect crustiness.  The fresh dates grown on The Farm added a nice sweet twist to our pizza with bacon and Schreiner's sausage.   Loved the crispy greens and a yummy buttermilk of the Modern Wedge salad. Grab a growler from 12 West and enjoy the unique renovation of one fabulous barn.  This is destined to become a neighborhood hit if it isn't already."}
{"text":"I am ADDICTED to Fire and Brimstone! I never order pizza from any other place after eating here. Every single menu item is absolutely delicious! I can't recommend this place enough! A few of my personal favorites are: the margherita (can't go wrong with a classic and the sauce is amazing), the buffalo chicken (my mouth is watering even thinking about this one), the modern wedge, and the cookie skillet (go crazy and order the butterscotch with bacon on it, trust me)."}
{"text":"Another simple yet great pizza place. Not another assembly line pizza place.  Wood fired oven.   Had the wedge salad, buffalo chicken pizza(which they are permanently adding to their menu), and a pepperoni pizza.  Everything made to order and fresh.  Will need to come back for their pizza cookies and cream corn because they looked great as well."}
{"text":"This micro kitchen packs a lot of talent and passion for good food--namely pizza. The pizza pulls inspiration from traditional Italian methods, but be ready for creative spins. The Fire & Brimstone pizza, loaded with chorizo and jalapeño, packs some serious personality and punch (add an over easy egg and you have a whole new dish). The pizza of the week offers a refreshing take on a simple food (my last visit it was a buffalo chicken and house ranch pizza).   Outside the pizza menu are some great finds. My favorite is the hummus. Have it as an appetizer while you're waiting for your pizza. The hummus is authentic and textured--as though someone's grandma made it (a fun addition to it: their lamb sausage).  Recently, the shop had a Valentine's Day dinner that included AMAZING dishes for that night.  I am hoping they continue the trend of special \"date night\" meals that allow us more hearty selections."}
{"text":"I had the veggie sandwich and added chicken. They were really accomidating to my dietary constraints and the food was delicious. I like their pickled veggies as well."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and we came to check it out. It is an add-on to Joe's and a great addition.  The pizza from Fire and Brimstone was yummy and the atmosphere is fun and lively here with the brewery and winery. I will definitely be back! And I hope soon!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROCKS!!   If you're looking for the coolest and tastiest pizza joint in AZ, then you've found it! The staff is really chill and friendly. They are really happy to accommodate to my food allergies, and really cared about the food. The pizza is ridiculously delicious, and their Butterscotch cookie is out of this world. If you don't like AMAZING food, this place isn't for you. I can't recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"The pizza here is top notch with some creative recipes that are fun and very tasty.  Quality craft pizza served in a really neat setting in Barnone.  The staff were also very friendly, patient, and quick.  I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"The pizza is always crispy and good, definitely recommend the fire and brimstone with a fried egg. Can't go wrong with any of the salad options either. Try the pita with homemade hummus with the tabouli OMG! My new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed that it took me so long to check out Fire and Brimstone at Barnone, since I live just a few minutes away, but this place is incredible. My friend Daryl and I stopped by for lunch and were definitely not disappointed. We split two pizzas - their signature pizza with spicy tomato sauce, FRESH mozzarella, jalapeños and spicy sausage; and the pizza of the day, which was a french onion soup inspired pie. The pizza dough was perfectly stretched and cooked to an even crisp. And the face that they have an awesome local brewery across the hall is a stroke of genius. And if you're not a beer person, they're BYOB so feel free to bring your favorite bottle. Their patio is also super dog friendly, so don't leave your best buddy behind!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!  Eat here if you get the chance.  My favorite is the Caprese Salad"}
{"text":"Fun concept within a coop/barn. Modern wedge was awesome. It's a little spicy! Pita and hummus was awesome, although my breath smelled for days of garlic. Pizza was great -- very good crust. And the hot cookie...don't even get me started. AMAZING! Warm cookie in a cast iron dish with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Best hot cookie I've had!"}
{"text":"I can't eat here anymore. I get grossed out very easily. We ordered The Veggie pizza. When it was delivered to our table, inside one of the lumps of goat cheese was a tangle of dark hair. It's been 3 months and I can't get the image out of my head. Every time I drive by I imagine that goat cheese hair wad and I have trouble eating my next meal. I loved coming here but once I'm grossed out, and hair usually does it for me right away, I'm done. In fact, my mouth is watering in nausea as I write this and recall the memory...   In my own kitchen we are very meticulous, and we pull our hair back by taking a clean tee shirt, pulling it over your head and then off until the neck hole is like a headband. All the hair is tucked into the body of the t-shirt and you're good to start cooking! So even if hair nets are expensive there are many ways to ensure you can serve a hair fee meal.   I'm sure the chances of this happening again are slim. If you're a vegetarian The Veggie is a good pizza. But that's my reason I can't come back."}
{"text":"Great food and quick.  We will be back many times.    Also very cool atmosphere.  They allow you to bring your own alcohol and have a micro brewery right next store.    Cannot wait to bring the family."}
{"text":"This great little restaurant is s in Agritopia. It has a decent sandwich, pizza and salad menu and offers a couple desserts too. Prices are reasonable, plenty of in and outdoor dpace, right across the hell from West brew where you can buy beer. You can sit anywhere within the building really and they'll bring your food to any place/brewery/winebar you're at.  Side note, fire & brimstone us a bring your own booze place which is a bonus!   I gave it four stars because I wasn't into any of the menu, was hoping it had pasta too but none that I saw."}
{"text":"What a great surprise this place was. My friends and I were driving around one day and saw this awesome barn looking warehouse. Weird I know but awesome! The place itself is called Barnone, cute right!? Fire and Brimstone was one of the first places we saw and smelt as soon as we walked in so almost right away we decided to grab some of this delicious smelling pizza. We were able to order here and then go to the brewery right across from this pizzaria and enjoy both this incredible pizza with some local brews. Speaking of local, one of the many great things about this place is that most of their ingredients are locally sourced. We got both the Prosciutto and Fig - prosciutto, fig, arugula, whipped ricotta, and added an egg and a special they had that day. And I don't remember the name and everything on the second pizza but it was a Mexican style pizza with chicken, a corn kind of slaw, and a cilantro cream. Both were very tasty, crust was bubbly and crunchy, and all around great wood fired pizza's."}
{"text":"Some of the best, friendliest customer service I've ever experienced.  Everyone knew & filled their role well, had excellent recommendations, & treated us like friends.  The atmosphere is rich & lively, filled with delicious smells & eclectic decor.  If you want to try some melt in your mouth perfection, their s'mores nachos are a MUST!  You can either dine on their patio or order drinks from 12West Brewing next door & sit on their side, & can't go wrong with either as the space has a very open feel.  We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Got the buffalo chicken pizza and it was pretty good except the excessive and thick ranch that was over the top and salty, drowning out any buffalo taste.  I had to wipe half of the sauce off and the pizza tasted much better.  The crust is great just like most brick oven pizzas.  I ordered their $9 farm veg salad and that's was disappointing.   From the description and the price, I thought I would be getting a large variety of garden fresh vegetables but sadly not so.  It was mainly lettuce with shaved carrots and radish...that was it.   Where are the beets, tomatoes, corn, broccoli, etc?  So unsatisfying.  Definitely a side salad. Could have tossed in some nuts at least to spruce it up."}
{"text":"Inside the half beer can establishment mixed with other local businesses and artists and literally right next to the brewery. Very very good pizza. It's been awhile since I've had pizza this good. Seriously good pizza. Like, legit good pizza. Crunchy crust with marshmallowy doughy inside that is perfectly charred on the bottom and cooked on top. Toppings are appropriately awesome and not soggy.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, the pizza and salads are full of flavor and you can tell they use a lot of fresh ingredients. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very good margarita pizza and prices seen on par with others in the area. The staff was super nice and the major upside is the atmosphere this place is awesome. It is located in barnone and right across a walk way from a bar, you can sit and eat on either side. Very cool concept worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service was superb! Ordered their special pizza Provenciale and the antipasto and both were full of flavor and ingredients were super fresh. The people who work here are super friendly and are eager to help. Very nice place to hang out and it's family friendly. It's byob, so that's definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"As someone who loves pizza and loves to try all the pizza places in Arizona. This pizza was good, thin, light and airy but still had a Decent amount of sauce. I had a margarita pizza and added pepperoni, as well as the pizza with jalapeños and sausage. The pizzas were good, I highly suggest the one with jalapeños and sausage. I cannot remember the name but do  remember the taste. I gave four out of five stars, due to them not taking orders over the phone or delivery."}
{"text":"Loved that it was a BYOB- really makes going out for a date night not as costly.  Appetizers were delicious, we go the antipasto with gluten free bread (Delicious GF bread- couldn't tell the difference!), the Caprese salad was delightful because the mozzarella was SO fresh! We also order the gluten free Caprese sandwich and a pizza with sausage and potatoes.  Everyone had a great meal.  The only disappointment was that there is no gluten free pizza crust.  But the sandwich options made up for that!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! The food tasted great. Fresh and very flavorful. The service was quick and very friendly. Portions were good enough to share. I will definitely be back. They let you bring your own booze and share space with a great brewery!! What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Cool little place inside of BarnOne.  Ordered pizza with sausage, pepperoni, olives and onion and it was very good.  A lot of places half freak over non dairy orders but these guys were cool.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the hummus to the point it was not even appetizing to look at. Please buy a blender that works. It was hard to choke down. Pizza was burnt and small for the cost. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Just finished up dinner at Fire and Brimstone for the second time and it was another great experience. We had a pizza and a wedge salad which was plenty for 2. After seeing a few of their desserts walk by we decided to try one. The owner and a few of the employees recommended the campfire s'mores nachos, it was incredible! Great food and great staff."}
{"text":"Amazing place, super cool ambience.  Was here on a Saturday night. I guess I was the last customer. Also, they even had a pizza oven shut. Guy at the counter was kind enough to take my order for a salad and an appetizer. Ordered - Caprese Salad : tasted really delicious with the wine from Garage East. Mozzarella cheese was really fresh and yum. Hummus Plate: tasted good. Liked the topping on hummus though, pita bread was fresh and totally made my evening.  I highly recommend this place. Service was quick and best of all its a patio seating with soothing live music."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to check out 12 West Brewing and while here, opted to try Fire and Brimstone next door. I was asking the guy (James) about the lamb options for the hummus as I used to live in Turkey and love me some spicy ground lamb! I told him about the little pizzas in Turkey called 'lamacun' and he was like, \"hey, want me to try and replicate it?\" Hell to the yeah! I am now a huge fan of this place! One, when does this happen?? Never in my life has someone opted to veer from the menu and be creative just for the fun of it. Two, it was quality food and super flavorful. Three, the beers at 12 West are bomb and you can eat the Fire & Brimstone's bomb pizza while drinking bomb beer. We will absolutely be back and will recommend to everyone we know!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Crispy thin crust with wonderfully fresh ingredients.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  The whole family was excited to know there was a new restaurant near by.  However, it took 30+ minutes for them to get out an appetizer that came out with the dinner. You don't get plates.  You have to get your own forks, napkins etc.  If you don't drink beer (or are pregnant), and don't drink around three choices of their sodas then you must drink what tastes like tap water without ice.  Ice-T is much healthier than their choice of sodas so they can't possibly play the, \"it's healthier card.\"   With out plates the soggy pizza made having no plates next to impossible and the staff was EXTREMELY unfriendly and unhelpful for a first timer.   I was let down BIG TIME."}
{"text":"The seating is s little scatter brained in the area but the pizza is great and the service was exceptional.   Definitely would like to return and try the s'mores dessert they have. Looked like a hot commodity the night we went."}
{"text":"Cool spot in Barnone (Agritopia.) Small space, small menu, but quality ingredients and food.  Probably not a great spot for large groups. The patio is a great hangout, especially in February! What I like best, is you can pair it with a beer from 12 West Brewery, directly across the barn from it. We sat on the 12 West Patio, and they brought our pizza out to us there. Our pizza had sausage, jalapenos, and cilantro. Hit the spot and paired well with our beers. They have a few other pizzas, and a few dessert items that I will try next time. The cookie/ice cream combo looks awesome!"}
{"text":"I want to LOVE this place but I just like it.  Each time I've dined here the pizza dough has been inconsistent.  Once burned and over cooked, once stretched thin and thick, and the other time a disproportionate amount of toppings.  I love fired pizza but haven't been crazy impressed yet by their pizza.  I adore the beet salad and also liked the season burratta and heirloom tomato salad.  The environment is funky and has a cool vibe and the service is decent."}
{"text":"Wickedly fun concept. Great food and BYOB (score)! I had a Fire and Brimstone pizza (spicy fun, add an egg!!). Good date place. Solid 4 star find!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good, would be nice if they had a drink bar (soda/tea).  Ordered a water and got a small cup with no ice.  A great option if you are looking to have a beer at 12 west and need a little something to eat."}
{"text":"{Wood-fired Pizza}  I eat at Fire & Brimstone at least once a week. Since I work at Barnone, it is very handy, but I would seek it out anyway.  First of all, I like the design. It reminds me of small places in San Francisco or other large cities where real estate is expensive and there are lots of talented chefs that want a place of their own. It transports one out of Gilbert and even Arizona in feel and scale. The decor is both crisp and eclectic with various objects of art and paintings.  The menu is very simple, given the tiny space. It starts with a couple of salads and a couple of appetizers. My favorite of the salads is a new take on the wedge salad. The garlicky buttermilk dressing is amazing and I like the wheat berries for texture. As for appetizers, the street corn as mentioned by other reviewers is addictive. I lean toward the hummus with lamb, though. The wood oven baked pitas are delicious.  Pizzas form the bulk of the menu. For me the crust is crucial and they do a great job of getting it right: thin and charred without being \"floppy\" or soggy. The pizza I choose most is Fire & Brimstone. I like the spiciness of both the sausage and the jalapeños. Sometimes I choose the pizza of the week. My go to beverage is from 12 West Brewing across the aisle. If I have a dining friend, we split a crowler of Frontside IPA, which pairs very well with pizza.  The dessert section is mainly cookie dough cooked in small cast iron skillets, topped with ice cream. I've had all of them and my favorite is actually the gluten free one made with Captain Crunch!  Its a great little place to eat, the staff is genuine and fun. I also like the fact that it is BYOB, so I can bring in beer from across the aisle or wine from the local winery or something from home."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza! Perfect crust and the taste of the sauce is phenomenal. The cookie is to die for! Excellent service with courtesy and a smile."}
{"text":"Went in on Memorial Day, no complaints! Quick service, good selection. Right next to it is a brewery with beer & wine selections that you can eat at too. I had the pizza special (ratatouilli sp?) & added a fried egg !"}
{"text":"Yo, this place is poppin. The pizza was ballin. Though we didn't get it, that smore's nacho dessert looks bomb. Gonna bring my significant other (gender not implied) to get that dessert after some sizzling pizzas off the flame later this week. Gonna be lit, fam.  Insta @whatisliftdriftco"}
{"text":"Come check this place out.    They make a butterscotch cookie thing in a cast iron pan with ice cream on top that I've been craving for weeks since I first tasted it.  It's seriously delicious.     Clean restaurant, fun and friendly staff and did I mention that butterscotch brownie/cookie thing?    I think I love you guys.     Really well done.    We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints the employees are always so kind and helpful and I absolutely love all of their pizzas and their weekly specials are usually a really interesting combination that I would never think to put together and yet it always turns out phenomenal. I use to live less than 5 min away from this place and now I'm about 15 min away but still visit weekly it's that great!"}
{"text":"I ate the pizza. I want another. Soon. Luckily, I live less than a mile away from near pizza perfection and the memory of my last pie lingers... oh it lingers..."}
{"text":"I love everything about this space except the seating. Terrible. If the tables are full there is nowhere to stand/wait - just an awkward layout. Also, if you are drinking you can only be on one side of the bar since the two aren't technically related.   However, the food makes up for it. The pizzas are amazing and the cookie/ice cream dessert... yum. We've also tried the hummus and cream style corn. All very good."}
{"text":"... I couldn't stop eating ...  I ate my pizza (seasonal with arugula), my wife's pizza (pepperoni with jalapenos) and my kids cheese pizza. I still wanted more. Best wood fired pizza in Gilbert, hands down."}
{"text":"I was seriously so impressed with this place. We ordered our food and grabbed a table at the brewery (which was also super awesome). Our food came out quickly and the servers are very accommodating and kind. The pizza we had was delicious and so was our appetizer. We would definitely return! Looking forward to seeing what Barnone offers in general in the future!"}
{"text":"Awesome wood fired pizza place in a very cool setting. Pizza came out fast and apparently the dough was acting up so the pie was kind of oddly shaped so they brought us 2 pizzas! That was a most awesome gesture. I love the slight bit of char on the crust and the sauce was perfect! If all you've been eating is dominos and papa johns you might be better off sticking to those places. The brewery right across the way had some amazing pale ales and a great saison which my gf had. A wonderful place with great atmosphere. Only been during the week so service was spot on and no crowd to deal with. Also, the artwork on the pizza boxes is so legit. I really enjoyed this place and have been back many times since."}
{"text":"Pizza is de-licious!!! I go out of my way to have their pizza. Salad is a different story. Like eating your front lawn. Super healthy seeming but close to inedible. I love a beet salad, but couldn't get through this one. Maybe if it was chopped finer and mixed with less bitter greens like romaine? I love going to this place. Great pizza and great beer right across the hall but salad just wasn't my cup of ... kale."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch here with the neighbors.  We all shared everything, starting with the creamed corn appetizer.  This was delicious with the perfect smokey spice and creamy sweetness.  We couldn't resist the wedge salad with the bacon and thinly sliced chives and fresh made dressing.  It was a large salad perfect for sharing.  We had the special of the day Pizza that had creative toppings of prosciutto, arugula, goat cheese and figs.  It was scrumptious!  We also enjoyed the Fire and Brimstone pizza topped with some of the best sausage I've had.  The atmosphere is unique inside this Quonset hut turned amazing creative restaurant shop space.  Sorry I missed out on the cookies and s'mores desserts.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options here! Welcoming staff that answered all our questions! We got a veggie pizza with a shaved salad that was very tasty and feeling. The food came out at fast and the young man checked in on us multiple times.  I highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and patio.  This is a cute little restaurant located in the Barn.  We ordered three pizzas.  All were good, not exceptional.  But the environment makes up for it.  You can bring your own wine, growler, etc. The drinks selections are very small, Coke, seltzer, bottled still water and a root beer.  The skillet cookies looked amazing.  Hope to try it next time."}
{"text":"I suggest Fire and Brimstone to all of my friends! It has the best atmosphere with food that cannot be beat! Their menu has a splendid variety of everything from delicious wood-fired pizzas to tasty salads and appetizers that are perfect sharing size. You can also order food and bring it to the brewery or winery next door, which is a huge plus! (or even bring a drink of your own to enjoy while at Fire and Brimstone) They have food for every type of preference too, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, and meat eaters like me too!   My favorite menu items are the Fire & Brimstone Pizza (w/ a fried egg on top!) Mm mm... Or the Wedge Salad is just as good as the pizza (I swear!)  For dessert, the s'mores dip is probably one of the best things I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Super yummy pizzas and salads! Not a ton of seating area indoors. Bar across the hall so you can get any drink you like."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had in a long time. Kids had cheese pizza, I had the margarita with prosciutto added, brother had the Fire and Brimstone, my husband had the special - fig, prosciutto, ricotta, and arugula. All were excellent. We polished off everything. Crust is thin, but not too thin, chewiness just right, and slightly charred.   Beet salad - great.  Hummus and pita - SO DAMN GOOD.  Chocolate chip pizookie - TO DIE FOR.  Better than any I've ever had.   Servers were so friendly and helpful. Patrons too.   The only con would be that you can't bring alcohol into the dining area (can get some at the bar). We could have brought our food over to the bar area but their tables were full and with a baby in a high chair, we couldn't sit at one of the high booths. Not enough to deduce a star, though.   My brother ended up going back and forth between the bar (Bar None) and the dining area...he says their beer was EXCELLENT.  :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try it out for a date night last week and it was delicious! We shared the fire and brimstone pizza and a wedge salad and now I can't stop thinking about it. I like the setup here although it can be odd to order food one place and then have to order wine at a separate restaurant. It's all very close and you can walk from one area to another along the patio."}
{"text":"One if the worst ran places ever management is lost in what they need to do. It seems like they don't know what they are doing. Took one hour to get two small pizza's. This place is a joke. Do waste your time."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I am really excitingly eager to write this review.  Okay, now that that's out of the way, here we go!  We originally went to kill about an hour before we went over to a food truck fest about a mile away and right away we knew the place was going to be cool, the industrial, modern architecture is alluring, and that's just the outside!  Inside was beyond cool, little stores and a hair salon all sit inside this warehouse barn.  My husband went to the bar and I took my son to get pizza and we met in the middle. {it's BYOB} he returned to the table and told me the bar was so nice and personable. He filled up his growler with his favorite IPA and brought us a drink to enjoy while we soaked in the atmosphere. The pizza was delicious and every bite was eaten, again, we were going to a food truck fest and intended to just drink a beer. Pizza was a compulsive slice of heaven! We couldn't believe we have never been there before and can not wait to return. My birthday is around the corner and every time I think I've found a cool new place to have my birthday dinner we find a better place! This was it, great night with our little family and we couldn't have had better service, food and beer. *remembers why she loves AZ*   Thank you to the guys @ F&B- see ya again soon!"}
{"text":"Best customer service around! James was very friendly, professional, and went above and beyond to help place my order when he was clocked out and going home! He stayed just to help me and another customer even though he was all done for the day. And their pizza is FANTASTIC! Thanks James!"}
{"text":"I had their signature pizza. This is some of the best pizza I have ever had!! The flavors went so well together. The crust was delicious. Everything delicious!"}
{"text":"This is awesome! The pizzas were all great. And I will dream about the wedge salad.  That being said, you must love spicy food or you will not be thrilled with the food. The crust was fresh and cooked perfectly, all the veggies were crips and yummy. Will definitely be back. The outdoor seating was wonderful and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here. Great service, food is good and light, and loved the atmosphere.  I like their daily special pizzas too. We enjoyed the brimstone, buffalo chicken (special), and hummus. I also like the brewery that is connected- grab pizza and beer while supporting small businesses."}
{"text":"I love Fire and Brimstone! This place has so many good options to choose from and, besides the usual options, they have so many creative and delicious options to choose from.   Lets start, Fire and Brimstone is right in Barnone - an awesome barn structure with many great shops inside. Right across the way is 12 West Brewing, so if you want to grab a beer to go with your pizza, there is a brewery literally right across the way in the same building. All that separates it is a little wall and some tables. This place also has a patio shared with the brewery and a wine bar, Garage East, next door!   The pizza was so delicious. We've been here several times and each time I've gotten something different and loved it.   DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE AND NOT STOP HERE! You won't be disappointed. We bring all of our friends to Barnone to enjoy pizza, brews, and everything!"}
{"text":"I took my two kids, my boyfriend, and his two kids here for lunch on Saturday.  I ordered a Fire & Brimstone Pizza with spicy tomato sauce with mozzarella, sausage, jalapeños, and cilantro.  I also needed something a little less zesty for the kids so I asked if they offered just a cheese pizza and the cashier said yes, so I paid for the 2 pizzas and some drinks, took my drinks and waited outside.  A little less than 10 minutes later a waitress brought out the Fire & Brimstone Pizza, but not the cheese pizza.  My first impression, aside from the fact that we were short one pizza, was that it wasn't a very big pizza at maybe 12\" across, but then their menu doesn't give you any idea how big these pizzas are so I had hoped it'd be bigger.  Clearly I'd under-ordered for 6 people.   My guy and I picked at it politely as the kids sat there; thinking maybe the other pizza would arrive shortly, but within 10 minutes we decided it was a toss up between eating a stone cold pizza *whenever* the other pizza arrived, or eating this one hot now and inquiring on the missing pizza.  We scarfed down the Fire & Brimstone Pizza; it was very tasty, it just wasn't enough.  Later I ended up walking over to the vegan restaurant down the hallway to order a supplemental meal.  In their hunger, our ravenous kids risked the heat of the jalapeños on the Fire & Brimstone Pizza and had some bites too, but because it was so small there wasn't much to go around for 6 people, but there were no complaints on the taste of the pizza.  A few minutes later I went back inside to find out what was going on and our waitress, who was very personable despite the situation, checked our order ticket and told me apologetically that it'd just be a couple more minutes...   (What on Earth is the delay in making a pizza with 2 ingredients: sauce and cheese?)  I could see the chef taking another pizza out of the oven at that same moment, so I assume the delay was that they forgot to put in all of our order.  Another 15 or 20 minutes later they brought the cheese pizza to us.  By this time I had already composed this review in my head.  I'm sorry you guys, do better with your order timing.  Our kids were cranky and really hungry by the time their food arrived, well after mom and dad's food had been finished, and we could have just stayed home and saved the $34 that two little pizzas and 5 drinks cost us, not including the supplemental meal from The Uprooted Kitchen.  ETA: I'm willing to try them again because the food was good and the service was friendly, I just hope it doesn't go sideways again like it did this time."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of giving only one star but, this is an unfortunate occasion.   Came in on a Friday night, it wasn't super busy. Definitely plenty of seating.   I must mention that it is really difficult to find this space. There's a sign on the outside that isn't easily visible from the street so we drove past it twice. Even once inside the building it's housed, the signage is lacking in visibility.   So we get to the front looking as about as confused as someone can look and I had to seek someone out for some assistance on ordering procedures. There was only myself and someone else so we ordered and sat down outside because it was nice that night.   With the restaurant/spot (I have no idea what exactly this place is trying to be) about half full, it took 45 minutes to get out two pizzas. 45 minutes. For two, on the menu not custom, pizzas. When the pizzas arrived half of mine was burned to a blackened crisp. I don't just mean there was black spots on the crust of the pizza, it was fully burned and smoking. Also, when I ordered, I requested that jalapenos not be on the pizza and the guy behind the counter said \"You got it dude\" so I know I was heard. But when the pizza came, jalapenos were on every slice.   The combination of the difficulty to find this place, the lack of service and the absolutely abysmal food made this one difficult to not be negative about.   I'm not sure if this was an anomaly or what on earth happened but I can promise you there is no chance I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent smokey bacon iceberg lettuce salad, had the seasonal fig ricotta arugula prosciutto pizza, normally I would hate on this pizza cause there was a tiny bit of prosciutto and a sprinkle of arugula but it was still delicious and reasonable priced, the crust was excellent and the pie was cooked perfectly, will return but will pay extra for toppings to make a truly memorable slice of epicness"}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing! Everything is super fresh and smells amazing. The pizza crust is delicious, perfectly thin but not overcooked, and what could be better than wood-fired smores?"}
{"text":"Perfect!  Great location.  James rides a Triumph motorcycle!  Cool place for something a little different."}
{"text":"Don't order the fire and brimstone if you like cheese on your pizza.  It's has random patches of cheese that's spotty at best.  This place is cool if you're a wanna be hipster or wish you lived on Abbot Kinney in Venice, CA.  If you're looking for good pizza and a good price this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Quick and friendly.  They will even deliver the pizza to various spots in the barn area.  We went over to the winery and they brought it to us.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. One of the best pizzas i've had in my life. I also tried the smores nachos and they were amazing! The only thing I would say is, it says BYOB, but there is a brewery next door. I had no idea, and it was kind of hard to find. But it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Always the best. Great food and service. The Fire and Brimstone pizza is amazing. Fun place to sit and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"Great tasting and healthy too! A great option for food if you're visiting 12 West Brewery. My flatbread was delicious and delivered faster than I expected."}
{"text":"Incredible Service and amazing food. I had the pizza of the week  would completely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good atmosphere and phenomenal pizza"}
{"text":"Second time here so much better than the first amazing job guys wife and I loved the cheese pizza and salad we had"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time tonite and I will definitely be back. Pizza was great and salad was delicious."}
{"text":"Grab a pizza here, grab a beer next door, and enjoy the weather on either place's patio. I love the simplicity of the items here. Both the Margherita and the Fire and Brimstone are delicious, but beware that the latter has some kick to it! The weekly special was also scrumptious, though unusual. I've never thought to put pistachio on a pizza, but it definitely works. I've heard the weekly special tends to push the boundaries on pizza toppings; I think it's great that the chefs have a creative outlet while keeping the regular menu tried and true. Definitely get some dessert before you leave. The chocolate chip and butterscotch pizookies are winners. I'll be back to try the s'mores nachos :)"}
{"text":"Wife and I had a great time here celebrating her birthday over lunch.  Sat on the patio of 12 West and had a couple good beers. Liked Acquisitions and their west coast IPA.  The pizza was fantastic! We had the buffalo chicken pizza and also a cheese pizza for our daughter.  My wife had one of their salads and it looked amazing.  She said the orange vinaigrette was fantastic. All in all a great experience and we hope to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now.  This is the best pizza crust I've ever had.  I love the fact that when you pick up that first piece it is still horizontal.  The tip doesn't droop down.  The flavors go so well together.  I usually try the special of the week pizza but the Fire and Brimstone pizza is great and a good choice.  I love all the salads.  Again, the flavors and freshness can't be beat.  The grilled black forest ham and gruyere cheese sandwich is my go to sandwich.  There is something here for everyone, even the gluten free options are really great."}
{"text":"Fire and Brimstone is a wonderful restaurant. It has an elegant and original vibe and maintains a vintage, rustic atmosphere. The pizza is made with care, and the flavor of the pizza is superb. The crust is the best I've ever had. Not to mention, there is a dessert cookie, which is warm baked with ice cream on top, and it literally melts in your mouth. The staff is welcoming, the atmosphere is sublime, and the food is tasty. What a great place to enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but I've had better \"earthy style\" millennial pizza. Some places can do good brick oven pizza, some can't. If you want to try it, go really hungry, so you can force it down. Stay away from the sausage though. The sausage burps up the taste of Alpo. (Yes, I've tried Alpo.)"}
{"text":"Great location. Great pizza. Try the grapefruit soda... yeah go ahead."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to eat. Love the modern wedge salad with chicken and one of the employees suggested pepperoni and bacon on the Margherita pizza which I've had several times and simply love."}
{"text":"Seriously may be the best pizza in the valley. Super laid back and polite staff, great place for kids and you can grab beer from the brewery or wine from the winery! Must try the modern wedge salad--the best buttermilk ranch in the world! I loved the sausage and my hubs thought the ham was delish! Kids are the pepperoni and lived that they were little small pepperonis! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We've ordered the buffalo chicken and the fire and brimstone and both are really good! But the fire and brimstone was our fav! The antipasto app and s'mores nachos are both winners too!! They also have BYOB which is awesome! So bring your own bottle of wine, order a pizza and hang out on their beautiful patio!"}
