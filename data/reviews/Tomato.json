{"text":"Delivery: I just paid $27 for two tiny room-temperature pizzas. Can't believe it.  Feel completely cheated.

Not sure how they can get away with two locations.  Montreal has some GREAT places for pizza but the overall standard really needs to improve so places like this won't exist."}
{"text":"Déception, me faire livrer une pizza et demander 2 extras pour finalement ouvrir la boîte et se rendre compte qu'ils en ont oublié un et j'ai été chargé. Retrouver 
2 cheveux qui ne sont aucunement les miens et vraiment \"pris\" entre le fromage et les condiments. Dégoutant."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The food reminded me of when I was in Rome. A nice find as we walked up Rue St Denis.  4 stars because it was a little pricy, but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Service was bad.    Too focused on making pizza delivery work out back.   Pizza was bland, nothing special."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is amazing! I ordered the basil-mozarella pizza with extra portobello mushrooms. I was a bit sad that they didn't have pickled hot peppers or something spicy in their extras, but upon opening up the box there was a little container of delicious hot oil/pickled banana pepper/chili seeds - so good. 
The crust itself you can't taste much (due to thinness), but this allows the ingredients to shine. I usually have 2 pieces of pizza to fill me up, but it's so thin I had to have 4 pieces of a medium to equate.
I will be ordering from here again and again and again...  I only wish there had been more basil :)"}
{"text":"Pizza is really expensive for nothing special and the service is deficient. I asked for a dessert and they had no more dessert and it was 8 pm really unprofessional. i don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"The pizza and panini were delicious as was the beet salad. The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us  get aquatinted  with the neighborhood"}
{"text":"We live right next door and thought that after 3 years of living there we owed it to ourselves to try it, as the patio is always full in the summer... turns out it's probably full of tourists thinking the same thing, and who never come back.

Pizza literally tastes like nothing, and food with drinks is expensive, and the service is not that great.

There is seriously better pizza in Montreal.... do yourself a favour."}
{"text":"Nous cherchions une pizzeria en nous baladant un soir dans Montréal. Premièrement nous sommes passé devant un autre établissement mais curieusement totalement vide.... Nous avons continué puis sommes tombés ici avec la terrasse bien remplie et une ambiance sympa.

Hop, une fois assis à l'intérieur faute de place dehors, nous avons fait notre choix sans trop d'hésitation. A savoir que si l'on prend des 12 pouces, on peut choisir une moitié d'une pizza et une moitié d'une autre pour varier les plaisirs.

Ma pizza au jambon de parme et roquette m'est arrivée légèrement trop cuite ce qui rendait difficile la découpe. Je n'ai pas été très satisfait de mon plat qui manquait un peu d'épaisseur et de saveurs. Je suis un peu sévère puisque mes amis ont apprécié leur pizza. Coup de malchance pour moi donc ? Je l'espère !"}
{"text":"This was a super fun place to stop by and grab some lunch after playing with the kids. Pizza came out quick and were very tasty some ice cold beers while sitting outside in the sun topped it off. Loved it."}
{"text":"I know this place can get really pricey, but in my opinion, the price is worth every cent! The pizza here, holy smokes, is out of this world! Ok, maybe just out of Canada! (I'm sure the standards are pretty close, if not equal, to that of some good pizzerias in Italy.) 

We came here on a warm sunny day in June. Everyone dining here was sitting out in the patio, so we did so too. They gave us water with the menus, and a pitcher of water for us to refill whenever - nice! Spaghetti with olive oil and garlic for $16?! Well, we thought, it better be worth it! And it sure was! The spaghetti noodles were soft and the flavour was completely absorbed by the noodles. We also shared a pepperoni mozzarella, 14 inch.  OMG! Taste buds went crazy! I added some pepper and oil from a jar they left on the table, and we couldn't believe what we were experiencing. This is, by far, the best pizza I've had since I came into the realm of humans.

Moreover, maybe just for my viewing pleasure, the waiter definitely belonged on a magazine cover. The bill came out in a very cute form and with treats! Would always be down to come here! Even the next day. And the day after that. (Sorry, wallet.)"}
{"text":"If only the food here wasn't that pricey, I would probably go back and you know, take my friends with me next time. But with a bill of $50 (including tax and tips) for two 9\" pizzas plus a half pint of Carlsberg, that's a surefire way to lose my friends' trust in my resto recommendations. Which is too bad because my pizza was pretty damn good. It's called la fôret noir and the toppings consist of prosciutto, portobello and mascarpone. The mascarpone 'blobs' on the four quarters of the pizza reminded me of egg benedicts and absolutely stole the show. Ambiance was lovely and service was not bad, but I can't really justify the price tag with any of the above."}
{"text":"It was our last night in Montreal and I was in the mood for pizza. My 17 year old son who didn't want pizza at first convinced us as we were walking up the side walk that this place was a must stop. knowing that all teanagers have ultimate wisdom on all things we caved to his demands. I could tell right away we were in for something different. The waitress was very polite and spoke just enough english to help us with the menu which had no English at all. No worries, the basic cheese and pepperoni were obviouse. we all got 9\" pizzas to eliminate the arguments. I got a large blond ale and my wife got a sangria. soda for the brats. so they send out some complimentary green olives and toasted bread with this bottle of oil with red stuff in it. It was hot but very tasty! This sauce was to play a vital role in my entire pizza! I don't know what it was but it turned my very good pizza into an amazing pizza! nice touch!  I was a little surprised at the bill comming to just over $100 for the 4 of us but I spent the same amount at almost every restaurant on this strip! You know it was good because the kids weren't complaining and there was nothing left to take home! And I liked it because it was nothing like you get back in the states. my wife gave her vedgie pizza a 3.5 stars. My daughter gave her plain cheese 4 stars.  My son gave his pepperoni a 4 and i also started with a 4 for my pizza which was the #7 or 8 but that magic hot oil bumped it up to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Autrefois une bonne adresse à Montréal. Aujourd´hui, une catastrophe en cuisine comme en livraison. 90 mn d'attente pour une pizza évidemment froide et très mal préparée. Un cauchemar. À éviter ... en attendant la fermeture !  Dommage."}
