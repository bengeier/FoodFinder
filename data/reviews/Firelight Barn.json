{"text":"We saw this on Groupon and got tickets.  It was a great show.  What a talented family, they have.  They are very friendly. We would recommend the show for all ages and will definitely tell our friends about it.  The food was very good as well.  Can't wait to go back and see another show."}
{"text":"The family is very involved in this endeavor.  They greet you, serve the food, and perform. Very talented family, kind and nice.  Food was amazing and the show was great.  Would do this again!!"}
{"text":"Great family entertainment - and done by a great family, too! Lively, toe-tapping music with singing and dancing and fun audience participation! Beautiful and strong voices! BBQ dinner and dessert was delish also!"}
{"text":"I give this fine group a million stars! Oops, I guess 5 stars is the top limit.  We have attended their performance many times. Such an uplifting experience! The food is great! Their smiles are contagious!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just got home from my first visit to Firelight Barn.  What a great time I had...I went with a group of 17 people, we had a fantastic barbecue dinner with drink and dessert and a great show by Mama's Wranglers.  Until she is introduced as the Mom of this entertaining family, you'd think she was one of the daughters.  This talented family act play violins, mandolins, drums, guitar, bass, piano, banjos and sing up a storm and they clog, that's right, clog!  They engage the audience and make you wish you were part of a family like them!  Go to Firelight Barn, it's by reservation only, so plan an evening and be prepared to have a good time!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome family show. Great music, great dancing, very fun, big smiles, just a great heartwarming experience. The food was excellent. I highly recommend this. It is actually one of the best shows we have seen in Vegas."}
{"text":"So much fun! GREAT FOOD and friendly family that runs the show! The owner or main man who runs the show came over and spent time with my while my son was fussy and helped entertain him. Jack Saturday is an awesome band. Definitely want to go for Karaoke night on a Friday!"}
