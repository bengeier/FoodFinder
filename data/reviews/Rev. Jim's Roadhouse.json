{"text":"This place is terrible. The burgers are stale and the bread tastes like it's a few days old."}
{"text":"I could not believe how unfriendly people are here. We were shocked. Not to mention that the food was just a total waste of money. We each got a burger and the bun was rock-hard."}
{"text":"This is a nice bar if you're looking for a fun night out at a place that does not over charge for drinks. The bartender is a very friendly guy who knows how to make drinks properly.

They have karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday nights starting at 9 pm and going until 1 am."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Excellent burger. Great service. Other reviews almost made me not come here. Glad I took the chance. Best burger I have had in quite a while"}
{"text":"Typical bar food. The cheese curds were delicious--some of the best I've ever had. The rest of the food was decently good.  It's pretty much what you would expect for bar food.

They have a shot wheel.  The shots are $3, and you spin the wheel to figure out what shot you will take.

There are lots of things to do...pool tables, darts, video blackjack, etc."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place. Beer is always cold. Haven't tried the food. Open late every night (they don't close early like some other places). The entry doors and bathrooms are leftover from when the building was a McDonald's...which I think is cool in a kind of kitschy way. Big place, plenty of room to spread out."}
