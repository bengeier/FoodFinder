{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Chan Yang.  Came here around 1:45 PM on a saturday for a late lunch and it was empty. Well, it's 2 PM, so that is to be expected I guess.  They've been in operation for a half a year as of writing, and the place still looks pretty new and well-maintained. Washroom is pretty clean as well, though there is only one.  I asked for suggestions from the waitress, who suggested the beef noodle soup and some other dishes based on my preference for noodles that day.   The order took some time to fulfill, the sound of an elevator could be heard after 5 minutes, and out came a bowl of noodles. These kitchen lifts are pretty amusing, but it also means you can't see how the kitchen looks.  The portion size was not too bad. You get at least half a dozen pieces of beef, with a handful of green onions and bok choy, filled with noodles underneath. The soup was very light in flavour and reminded me of wonton soup that I get in chinatown restaurants for some reason. Not sure if it's something they add that gives it that particular flavour or just the green onions. I think some spicy flavour would've been better, but there didn't seem to be any condiments available on any of the tables.  Price isn't too bad; it's about the average price for most places in the area. Would have to try a few other dishes to see if it'll stay at 4-stars for me.  Unfortunately I did not take a very close look at the menu, so I can't say much about the options available (oops). Well, it felt a bit awkward being the only person in the restaurant sitting there taking my time going through each item and taking pictures of the menu so...next time I'll bring a group.  They don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Very authentic Taiwanese Food!   We tried several traditional dishes such as the Crispy Chicken with Rice, Ginger Garlic Chicken with Rice and Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs with Rice. The cold dish Shredded Chicken with Scallions is a great starter. Ambiance is casual and very approachable. One of the better eats in North York Centre.   You will be surprised at the flavours! Try it today!"}
