{"text":"Bottom line - delicious as evidenced by the need to make reservations well ahead of time.  Service - perfect.  Atmosphere - yes, it is in some kind of row house in Sharpsburg.  You don't go here for the atmosphere. They did the best they could with the location. I like the shiny copper bar. On a weeknight the place was booked with mostly older couples and people celebrating special occasions.   Food - everything was perfectly cooked. It has been a few months and I don't remember exactly what we had. I know the fish was delicious as was a creme brulee type dessert. There was not a wrong mouthful. Every bite reminded me of the most perfect example of something my grandmothers would make. So I wouldn't call it cutting edge and I don't think they are trying to be. The local and green are bonuses to the deliciousness. I could eat this food any night."}
{"text":"This is definitely a 5 star restaurant, in my opinion, it is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately it has been closed! :( Good news is the chef is considering a new venue...hopefully soon!!! I really miss BT!"}
{"text":"I recommend it highly. Local ingredients are carefully prepared, and the chef is a craftsman.  A world of warning (and this is reflective of some of the earlier reviews), if you have a reservation after 8 on a busy night, the available ingredients may run out and the chef will have to improvise. This will slow things down as well. The \"high maintenance\" hostess must be gone, because the current one was both helpful and an effective manager of the room"}
{"text":"Went for the first time very recently and it was a totally positive experience. Everyone was helpful, low-key, and seemed happy to be working there. Pleasant small room, quirky but non-annoying music. For me, BYOB is a huge plus (unlike for one of the other reviewers) especially since with prices like this, it's nice to save money somewhere!   Having heard (mostly) wonderful reports of the chef, I told the waiter that I would eat whatever the chef wanted to make for me. That turned out to be two hamburger-sized tenderloins topped with grilled foie gras and set on a base of some fabulous cheesy potatoish thing. Who cares what it's really called, it was great! Between the tenderloin were some thin green beans.  (Here and at Casbah {and Whole Foods} they call them haricots verts -- meaning \"green beans\".) It was all flavorful, tender, beautifully seasoned, marvelous. My companion had lamb but I can't tell you anything about it because she ate it all.  The waiter told me that they are happy to do a tasting menu, but that you should let them know you want that when you make a reservation."}
{"text":"I've gone to a long of fine dining restaurants in Pittsburgh and Philly and I've never had a better meal than here. The menu is interesting and imaginative and the staff is friendly. Although the location is a bit questionable, it's beyond worth it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is great. From beginning to end the food and service were outstanding. It's a different menu each night and the duck I had was fantastic. Don't miss the dessert. Highly recommended for this small dining space with wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ate here last night, pretty yummy.  We received a tip from a friend about this place, and wanted to try for ourselves.  Do not let the exterior fool you- it's in Sharpsburg in kind-of a funny/weird area.  However, the exterior/neighborhood has never stopped me from a new dining experience.   Inside, the restaurant isn't huge and we were seated next to the window- which had a thick white curtain, because there isn't really much of a \"view.\"  Again, I was ok with this.  The food was really good, we started off with the Oyster appetizer, phenomenal, then we each had a salad, also great.  Then I received my Bay Scallops and Van got his lamb chops.  For maybe the first time ever, Van ordered better than me.  My scallops were alright, but had a little after taste and didn't taste super fresh.  Van's chops were amazing! Cooked perfectly, and melted in my mouth.  Also, the presentation of everything was beautiful. We then ordered the cheese platter for dessert, which was good as well. This place is a little pricey, around $30 per entree- but a nice ambiance, and was packed around 6:30pm.  Definitely make reservations, and it is BYOB- so don't forget a bottle, or two.  All in all, great date restaurant- service was friendly, polite and knowledgeable.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We drove past this place twice before we found it, it's pretty much nondescript. No bright lights or signage to catch your eyes at all. Then we found out it has been there 8 years, which was a total shocker to me!   The waitress we had was well-informed regarding the menu, and all items were quite fresh (obviously!). It was crowded and noisy, but that really didn't bother us since we were there to socialize with our friends!   The appetizers we had were fancy, but not fulfilling--heirloom tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and a cheese/cracker strawberry compote plate.   Between the six of us we had the scallops, swordfish, veal and duck. All were cooked perfectly, and the presentation was very chic (not as chic as Salt of the Earth). We all thought the swordfish was fabulous, it truly melted in your mouth. The protein, of course, is the main feature on the dish, and the portions were fine. It would have been nice to have a little larger portion of the sides that accompanied the protein, couscous and kale were with the swordfish.   Desserts we tried were the trio of sorbets, creme brulee and a toffee chocolate cake. I'm a huge fan of creme brulee, and this was good, but the not the best I've ever had. Small portions but tasty. Again, presentation was lovely.   The guys in the group left saying they needed some \"real food,\" which translates to bulkier portions, but the women were satisfied."}
{"text":"Man do I love this place!  The menu is amazing and the food is incredible!  The host/hostess are always super polite and they provide a tasty little amuse bouche to get the evening started.  I have only ever ordered the duck and and it fantastic.  I recently had the toffee/chocolate tort for dessert and the banana icecream that it came with was delicious.   My only complaint about this place is the overall ambiance.  The lighting and vibe are very intimate, by my fear is what it would look like with the lights turned fully on!  The walls are a bit chipped, the drapes seem a tad dirty and the bathroom are below average.    Make sure that you have a reservation and if you leave a message to make one and they don't call you back, be sure to follow up!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, when we first arrived in Sharpsburgh from Butler my aspirations were not too high despite the positive reviews I'd read online.  My wife and I walked into this restaurant and from the moment we arrived we felt welcomed.  The service was exceptional and the food was beyond anything I would have imagined.  Our server, Justin, was very well versed on the ingredients and origins of the dishes, and I can only give great applause to the owner, Douglass, for his fantastic vision and concern for great product.  We visited here for my wife's birthday dinner and my only problem is, either we need to move closer to this restaurant, or we need to find a more permanent babysitter.  If you live in the Pittsburgh area or others near or far, you need to dine at this restaurant or you are doing yourself a true disservice.  I thought that the prices were extremely fair considering the quality of the food that you get and the service that you receive.  The people here take obvious pride and concern for the level of your dining experience.  I can see why reservations are watched very carefully.  They do not rush and they \"create\" an amazing experience. Cheers to all of the people at Bona Terra.  You do it right and your efforts are recognizedl  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"this restaurant is very appropriate for a 2nd or 3rd date...never a first date, cuz they take toooo freaking long to serve u, but i do appreciate the service~"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and have always had great experiences.  I'm no foodie, but I enjoy a nice meal every once in a while, and Bona Terra is my favorite place for extra special occasions.  Their food is fresh and locally grown, and the menu changes daily based on what the chef buys at the market.  I've never had a better beef tenderloin anywhere.  Decor is simple yet tasteful, and the waitstaff is friendly and polite.  Their music choices are top notch, too (I've heard everything from Beck to Radiohead to Band of Horses), but never obtrusive."}
{"text":"I am a fan, despite the high maintenance hostess.  The food is great, and the ambiance is cozy (although I do question some of their musical choices).  Really, just come for the food.  It's not going to be someplace you want to take someone you don't know at all, but if you've gotten a feel for them, and they seem more relaxed, this is a perfect place.  The menu changes almost daily (this is the epitome of farm to table - they base their menu around what they can get from the market THAT DAY).  I don't know if they do the whole sustainable organic thing, but you can be sure they got the local part down.  I had the shrimp bisque, which was quite tasty.  But the best part by far was the duck breast.  I really enjoyed that!  And a couple of amuses thrown in... quite nice.  Dessert was good too, but not as good as the main.  It's BYOB, so be prepared.  Also, if you want to make a reservation, they really make you jump through hoops - you can't just leave a mesg, and have them call you back to confirm - they make YOU call back after receiving THEIR mesg to confirm.  Seriously - it's kind of annoying.  And they give you shit if you miss your reservation - I've NEVER had that experience at another restaurant before, and it's a testament to how good their food is that I'm willing to put up with that crap and go back."}
{"text":"Every thing I had here was AMAZING  and i consider myself a rather harsh critic.  This is the best I have found in Pittsburgh by far!"}
{"text":"Making one of my 4-5 yearly visits to the 'Burg this past weekend, I had a wonderful dinner here.  The only problem was construction on Route 28 and poor detour signs.  The food and service were top notch.  Our table tried several appitizers and salads each in it's own way perfectly plated and seasoned.  The top two were the fig appitizer and the gnocchi appitizer.  For dinner, the crabcakes were better then anything I've had (including living in Baltimore for 5 years).  The fried polenta served with them was good, not great.  The  Beef entre was nothing but superb, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Alas, for dessert we all had the dense chocolate cake  with brown sugar cinammon ice cream and fresh berries.  Perfect ending, but can't comment the other choices.  This is now my go to place during my Pittsburgh visits."}
{"text":"We went there for the New Year's Eve dinner.  It was my first time there so I didn't know what to expect.  What I got was way more than what I would have thought.  An amazingly small and cozy place with a great chef.  Food was great.  It was a five plate meal (appetizer, soup, salad, entree and dessert).  We each got to pick one appetizer, entree and dessert.  Everything tasted great, fresh and with a great imagination in their creation.  I am sure that we will visited again soon!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, inventive, and delicious.  This is my favorite go-to restaurant when I want a special meal.  An anecdote:  Once we wanted a great meal but had a 3-year old with us.  We made a 6:00 reservation to be ahead of the serious diners.  The waiters could not have been nicer.  They suggested appropriate choices for the little girl, and she responded by enjoying her meal as much as the rest of us.  A class act.  Another:  We went there on a dreadful snowy night in February 2010.  (If you were in Pittsburgh, you remember that snow!)  We were treated to some special extras from the kitchen.  No doubt it was a slower evening than normal, and the kitchen and waiters made it festive for us."}
{"text":"Bona Terra has become one of my new favorite restaurants in pgh and have made me a believer in the farm-to-table movement.  Chef Douglass creates a new menu daily...using the fresh ingrediants he finds as inspiration.    I read a lot of gripe about how expensive this place is and was afraid I'd be spending a fortune (they dont have prices listed on their sample menus on the website). But compared to other nice restaurants, it's really not bad...and it's BYOB so that saves a lot of cost. Appetizers ran from $8-12 and entrees $28-38 (most were around $28, only the filet of beef tenderloin was $38).   Not gonna go into too much detail about our meal, but it was delicious from the appetizer to the dessert.  They also give a complimentary amuse bouche and palate cleanser sorbet.  And their homemade bread -- wow, so good.  Service was perfection.  The decor could use an update, but the ambience is cozey and homey.    As for the reviewer that said it was all 70+ aged people, I really don't know what he was talking about (and why that's even such a big deal).  Most of the tables were couples around my age or a little older, in their 30s or early 40s."}
{"text":"Don't go hungry. The portions are very small and we had a 9:00 pm reservation and we were served our food at exactly 10:35 pm. We never received an apology from anyone nor did we even hear from our waitress Evan from approximately 9:45 until our food arrived. Unfortunately, our food was not very good either. We are very surprised as we heard this place was terrific but the experience was awful and the food sub par. We actually heard the people next to us complain about their portions and the people on the other side complained about the wait. Both received adjustment to their bill but we chose not to say anything as we were with another couple whom we did not know overly well. We are going to give this place another try since we have heard such great things. Hopefully our next experience will be a better one."}
{"text":"Summary: The food is delicious. The constantly changing menu ensures freshness and variety. The well trained staff is possibly the best in the Pittsburgh area. The location is out of the way, and the price is high for what it is.  Bona Terra occupies the perfect space for a cozy neighborhood bistro, but it  has sets for itsef up more ambitious aims. It not only features a talented chef, but has also trained a set of polished wait-staff whose services are smooth and attentive yet unobtrusive so that the food takes the center-stage.  My dinner consisted of a seared tuna appetizer, followed by duck as the main course, ending with the peach cobbler dessert. The preparation was bold, not fussy. The quality of the ingredients allows the flavor to speak for itself.  For my vegetarian companion, the chef prepared a dish off the menu, taking care not to include ingredients that she didn't like (you need to call ahead for vegetarian choices). The Asian-influenced soup that another companion ordered, however, was less felicitous; it's the one off-note all evening. Overall, the chef seems at his best when preparing contemporary dishes with strong flavors; I recommend staying away from plates that require deft hands and subtlety.  This restaurant reminds me a bit of Pangea in Shadyside. BT has a greater variety, but Pangea handles fusion flavors better. BT is attempting to give its diners a more refined experience with way better service; on the other hand, Pangea is convenient, costs 10% less, and offers a bar and live jazz. for a more lively atmosphere.  I enjoyed my meal at Bona Terra, and would not mind eating there again. However, I suspect that it wouldn't be an option that pops up in my mind frequently."}
{"text":"After 4 years living in the burgh, Bona Terra is still one of my favorite restaurants.  The ingredients are always fresh and local, and the chef is innovative enough to come up with new dishes on the fly.  This is especially helpful since my bf is a vegetarian.  The staff is still super friendly.   They even gave me updates on my flyers during dinner since there is no T.V.    BYOB with a cork fee (~$5 I think).  Definitely worth it.  They have a decanter and filter if necessary.  The atmosphere is very romantic, but causal enough for a nice family dinner with the parents.  My favorite dishes there continue to be the pan roasted duck and pan seared snapper.  When accounting for the fact that you can bring your own fancy bottle of wine, the meal is really not that expensive.  I would advise gps when you go, you would never imagine a nice restaurant on that street."}
{"text":"We, along with 2 other couples, had a fantastic dinner here Saturday night.  The fried oyster appetizer and the wild  mushroom soup are reasons to return. Waiter Justin coupled his knowledge with humor, being both attentive to and patient with us,. All entrees were solid performers."}
{"text":"While I don't get to BT very often, probably over 2 years now, it is one of my favorite restaurants.  The Chef has won some great awards, embraces the Farm to Table movement and it shows in his final product.  Of course, love the BYOB too.  Went with some friends who go to BT a couple of times a year.  We all brought a bottle of wine to share with our meals.  Many interesting choices and service was very quiet and prefect.  Had a Cous Cous appetizer which was very good with a wonderful combination of tastes.  The Veal Chop was perfectly cooked, very tender and came with some very good potato and veggie.    Save room for desert.  The chocolate cake with homemade ice cream was rich, sweet and a table favorite.   The restaurant is a little hard to find so make sure you have the address.  The decor is a darker colored and nothing special, somewhat minimalist.   The food is what makes this a great restaurant.  Great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Good Italian food.  In a city where it seems like 75% of the restaurants are Italian, (which is not a complaint; merely an observation) Bonna Terra is a step above the norm. The food is authentic and dependable, and no matter what you order you can expect it to be perfectly cooked, well presented, and very flavorful. While it is not the best Italian restaurant in the Burgh, it ranks among the better ones. (And is a great place to take a new date if she/he has never been there before)"}
{"text":"Full Review in Blog.  A BYOB located in a rather blue collar part of town the restaurant may seem an odd choice to the unfamiliar-everything about its location, size, and layout seems to say \"locals only.\" What those paying attention would realize, however, is that Chef Douglas Dick has twice been a Beard Award Semi-Finalist, thrice been named Pittsburgh Magazine's Chef of the Year, and has been embracing the \"Farm to Table\" movement since before most had American's even heard of it.  Locally sourced foods prepared by an internationally educated chef and a menu that changes daily (because Dick goes to the market daily for his products) everything about Bona Terra sounded fantastic.  Given our large lunch and long drive ahead it was decided that we would share a couple of small appetizer plates prior to our mains - and given the fact that neither appetizer required cooking they would arrive quite quickly after our amuse.  Starting first with a cheese plate, Cypress Grove Lamb Chopper with poached Bartlett Pears, Mixed Berry Infused Honey.  Brought forth by the same company who makes my favorite cheese of all time, Humboldt Fog, the Lamb Chopper was described as a sheep's milk Gouda imported from Holland.  Smooth as butter and fragrant without being pungent the fromage was accompanied by impossibly sweet pears, water crackers, local strawberries, and a clover honey blended with what tasted largely of blackberry.  A very well composed plate and a great cheese.  Following our appetizers would be a short delay-but a delay with the most unexpected treasure of the night...a bread and butter combo that still leaves me weak in the knees.  Served singly (thank goodness or I'd have invariably eaten ten,) and piping hot from a wooden basket were \"Brioche Rolls and Salted Peach Butter.\"  Warm and buttery on their own the rollswould have been suitable without any topping - but paired with a peachy sweet mélange of butter and cream cheese, they were heavenly. All told I ate four...in retrospect I still wish I would have eaten ten.  For my sister's main - Oven Roasted North Atlantic Cod over Israeli Cous Cous and Sauteed Green Beans, Tarragon Infused Butter-Wine Pan Sauce with Grilled Black Mission Figs.  Having never seen fig meets fish on a single plate I was intrigued by this dish from the start and only moreso when it arrived.  A substantial slice of mild and buttery cod over a toothsome cous-cous and pan-crispy green beans, the fish was topped with a halved plump and juicy Fig clearly soaked in wine and butter while a sweet/savory reduction of butter, wine, and chopped figs circulated the plate.  While the plating, in my opinion, could have been dressed up I'm rather certain the flavoring and quality couldn't have been improved.  While my companions' dishes were good mine was unreal - and only improved from the menu listing when Chef Dick informed us that he'd just gotten in a lobe of foie gras and if it \"met his approval\" he'd like to add it to the dish.  Arriving with the smells of cinnamon, cherry, allspice, and thyme the \"chef suggests medium rare\" Seared Maple Leaf farms Duck breast and Hudson Valley Foie Gras over long grain Basmati rice, Sauteed Zucchini, Local Sour Cherry Compote, Sweet and Spicy Tropical Jamaican Jerk Reduction was fantastic.  Smooth and supple with a clean layer of fat ribboned beneath the crispy skin the duck was potentially the best quality duck meat I've ever had.  Topped with a velvet and ample slice of foie gras a presented over a benign rice and vegetal zucchini mélange the dish was brought to a peak by the addition of poached black cherries and a reduction that added heat and spice without overwhelming the multiple nuances of the dish.  After a meal so stunning dessert was a must - For my sister's selection she targeted the Bavarian Chocolate and Hazelnut Tart with Local Strawberries.  Served in a buttery crust similar to my mothers, Erika's tart would consist of a creamy whipped dark chocolate mousse loaded with what I can only describe as \"Chunky Hazelnut Butter.\"  Something like a \"dark\" Nutella pie the simplisticy of the tart was matched only by its decadence.  For my dessert the decision was between cheesecake and the dish our server described as the \"house special.\" With everything exceptionally special so far I went with the obvious - a simple and decidedly indulgent Rich Chocolate Cake with Peach Ice Cream.  Served almost like Keller's Bouchon dessert the thick, rich, and warm cake was topped with a large scoop of ice-cream that tasted like a melting peach without the fuzz.  Focusing on the cake-the texture was almost that of a steamed pudding-a little wet, but \"set\" and hefty.  Bona Terra was one of those experiences that makes you realize just how good largely unmanipulated fresh fruits, vegetables, and proteins can be when placed in the hands of a skilled chef.  Great food, wonderful service, and a nice location without all the hype and frills - a \"hidden gem.\""}
{"text":"Bona Terra has been open a long time and truly has become a Pittsburgh classic.  I have been there many times over the years and I can remember my first dinner there about 7 or 8 years ago.  The BYOB concept was so novel for Pittsburgh.  They were playing OK Computer from start to finish over the speakers.  It was quite memorable for the excellent ingredients and creative presentations.  Fast forward to the present where we dined with a couple close friends on a Saturday night.  Bona Terra really hasn't changed a lot over it's time.   In many ways it has declined.  They still play great music, but it's so loud inside that you can't hear it.  Our party had 8:00pm reservations.  We arrived 10 minutes early and had to sit at the bar.  Because Bona Terra still doesn't have a liquor license, we were offered nothing while we awkwardly waited.  An interesting non-alcoholic drink offering would have been nice.  At our reservation time we were seated promptly and given menus, but our first bottle of wine wasn't opened until 25 minutes later.  We didn't receive our first course until 8:50 and we were absolutely starving.  Our server was very nice, but everything was exceptionally slow.  Our entrees weren't delivered until 9:45 and we were really starving by then.  Delays like this are easier to tolerate if the food is great.  Unfortunately, some of our dishes fell short.  The fried breading on the oysters appetizer was too think and completely overpowering.  One of our party had the sea bass and was very disappointed.  My spinach salad with eggs, tomatoes, and portabello mushrooms was basically all spinach with barely any of the other mentioned ingredients.  My duck was well cooked, but it wasn't very creative and overall just seemed safe.  \"Safe\" is probably the best way to describe the food at Bona Terra.  It's  higher-end comfort food.  The menu and preparations have barely changed over the restarurant's existence.  Creative ingredients or newer cooking techniques are completely absent from the menu.  There's no question that Bona Terra appeals to an older clientele.  Besides the out-of-place children eating there (for whatever reason every time we have been to Bona Terra we have seen children, and it's not a bring-your-kids-to kind of place), almost everyone was 70+.     It would be nice to see Bona Terra revamp their menu and include some more adventurous choices.  Places in Pittsburgh like Notion, Spoon, and Salt of the Earth have far more interesting and unusual menu selections.  I'd also like to see them completely redesign the ugly yellow interior and finally get a liquor license.  They do offer a 7-course tasting, but how can you properly match wine pairings unless you bring 7 different bottles of wine?  I would like to see less tables so it's not so freaking loud inside.  I don't think this will ever happen because that would alienate their loyal clientele who for many years have fought for reservations to have a nice, comfortable, safe, \"fancy\" dinner."}
{"text":"Fanciest place I've been to in Pittsburgh. Great for foodies. Creative dishes and great service. Note, BYOB."}
{"text":"I went to Bona Terra last night for the first time after hearing about it for years.  It was like a great first date with me thinking about the experience much of today.  Chef Douglas Dick is nationally recognized with recognition in some of the national food magazines and has been recognized with an award for one of the best \"farm to table\" restaurants in the country.  He's all about the best ingredients and the menu changes daily because of that.  When you make a reservation they call you back to confirm and give advice with respect to parking and other details.  Great start!  It's located in sharpsburg which is a working class part of pittsburgh.  The restaurant is right across from the \"family dollar\" retail store and located on the same street with many \"shot and a beer\" establishments.  The space itself is, well.... not nice.  What can I say?  He must really want the focus on the food.  The lighting is bad.  The ceilings are low.  The furniture is Ikea or walmart and the bathroom is tiny.  The silverware is target and the plates are uninteresting.  The service is slightly above average, but still mostly 20somethings working till they  figure out what they really want to do.  The Maitre'd, Adam was actually very good and helpful and honored our request for a printout of the impromptu tasting menu we requested.  But, the FOOD!  OMG is the food incredible.  The food is on par with some of the better restaurants I've been to coast to coast, not the best, but this can stack up in any city.  A friend that I had lunch with suggested that we ask for a tasting menu.  We didn't even look at the menu and just asked the server to ask the chef to make us as many dishes of whatever he wanted with no restrictions.  I suggest you do the same, but Kathy said they usually won't do this on the weekends, so better to try for a weekday.  Ok, the meal started with an amouse bouche (sp?) which was a piping hot cauliflower soup.  It was pretty good, but not memorable.  The first course was amazing.  It was a perfectly caramalized dayboat scallop with a strawberry chutney and a 20 yr. aged balsamic.  This combination was the best scallop I've ever tried.  It was like the first time you had ice cream.  The next dish was a pan seared grouper with vegetables.  This dish was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully, but for me it wasn't memorable.  The seared tuna with microgreens and candied kumquats (what! as if kumquats werent' sweet enough) and toasted almonds was delicious.  The \"prime\" lamb chop came next and was the best lamb chop I ever had paired perfectly with collard greens.  The waiter then asked us if we could still keep going, we said bring it on, so finally was a kobe beef sirloin, which was rich and unlike any steak I've ever had.  The desserts were okay, but nothing special.  I actually didn't care for the lemond tart, but really liked the coconut lime sorbet.  The bread served with dinner was just out of the oven and served with this interesting cherry butter.  The pacing could have been a little faster we took about 3 hours with dinner which certainly could have been 2 1/2 hours.  Overall a great chef that we are lucky to have.  The portions were reasonable and no one felt uncomfortable after all these courses and the price was about $70 each, which is very reasonable considering the quality and the fact that is BYOB.  I can't wait to visit Bona Terra again."}
