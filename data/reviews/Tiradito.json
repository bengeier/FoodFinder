{"text":"So far, the best Peruvian restaurant I've been to in Montreal. As a Peruvian, I'm quite picky when it comes to our food. The concept of the restaurant is Nikkei cuisine, which is fusion of Japanese and Peruvian flavours. Tiradito's entr√©es where all incredibly flavourful. Our definite favourite was the octopus anticuchos and the smoked salmon causa. The drinks (we had the maracuya sour & the pisco sour) were incredible. Just as good as the ones back at home. Nice atmosphere and great service. Will be definitely going back and highly recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"Many thanks for a delicious meal of potatoes Peruvian style, tuna tiradito, salmon chevice, and avocado causa."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and dinner on a Saturday night  and had an excellent time. Most of the seating is around the bar - perfect for a date. The food was incredible, the drinks were creative, and the servers were super friendly and attentive. Our ceviche took a bit longer than expected to come out, however we were offered complimentary shooters to make up for it which really made the night. Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Waited for a half hour and never even had our drink order taken. The place wasn't even at capacity, but the service was terrible. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night at 7:30. Waited about 40 minutes for two spots along the side wall, which were the only spots for walk ins - all of the bar seats were reserved.  The restaurant is tapas style. Our server recommended 2 - 3 dishes per person. We thought we were both pretty hungry, so we were ambitious and went for three dishes each. I didn't try the butifarra sandwich, but almost everything I tried was excellent. My favourites were the octopus anticucho and spicy calamari. The spicy cauliflower was the only dish that really fell flat. It wasn't spicy at all and the combination of the fried cauliflower and coconut milk was too much.  The atmosphere was lively and everyone was there to have a good time. Service was friendly and quick. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Called this place twice and they left me on the phone for 10 minutes both times. If they fix their reservations and I can actually try this place maybe I can adjust the review!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend w a group of friends. It has a fun & lively ambiance & super friendly staff. The pisco sour was delicious. We asked our waiter to select dishes for the six of us to share - and he did not disappoint. We started with the cauliflower in coconut curry, which was light & flavourful. We also sampled the calamari, tostadas, lobster causa, fish of the day ceviche, kimchi, potatoes, duck sandwich, and blood pudding empanadas. So LOTS of food, but small portions so we just had the perfect tasting. My favourites were the lobster & tostadas. The empanadas were also amazing. Surprisingly my least favourite was the ceviche. But perhaps I just didn't like the fish of the day (red snapper type fish). We ate so much there was no room for dessert. I highly recommend going here w a group of friends. A fun & tasty experience. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place for a night out with friends. Totally not recommended for families! The place has a very creative menu with tapas-style plates of Peruvian food with an asian fusion twist. Not a large selection, but enough that if there are several of you and you decide to try a few plates and share, you will have plenty of great discoveries. I went with a friend and we indeed shared many things. We picked everything that had no gluten in it which means we had many of the fish and veggie dishes. I believe the meat dishes that night all had gluten so I did not try them. I loved the ceviches, loved that there was nice colors on the plate, many textures, and overall things I had not eaten before in this type of combination.  You sit around a long bar that curves around the room so you see them cook and prepare your drinks. Cocktails were amazing too and I tried one with a combination of liquors and juice I had never tried before. Everyone was so friendly, the place was packed and you had to have a reservation, even though I went in the midst of winter and there was a snow wtorm starting outside. I am planning to go back as the memories are just too perfect!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor and ambiance. Seating is right up along the bar, where you're entertained by your chef/waiter assembling tapas. The cocktails are fantastic - we tried the pisco sour and guapita (cava & gin) - both highly recommended! For food, our favourites were the crispy potatoes and the octopus. Both were accompanied by sauces that were to die for. As people have mentioned earlier, the plates are a little pricier than what's warranted by the portion sizes, but if you're willing to splurge while sipping on great cocktails, this is your place!"}
{"text":"From Toronto, we came to Montreal for the weekend and I always do my research on the best new places to eat. For one of our two meals, I picked Tiradito, a Peruvian/Japanese fusion restaurant. OMG. WHAT a great pick! Cocktail list to die for, and so many completely unique options. My favourite was the El Vato which had, among other things, sesame seeds in it. And the glass was wrapped in a leaf. The sharing plates here are to die for, and to pick a favourite would be tough, but if pushed I think it might be the parmesan scallops. We had the pleasure of meeting the head chef briefly, and this guy has a good thing going. We also loved the design of the space. It seats 50, but all bar or communal seating, so the staff have a very large space in the middle to work their magic, and magic they do work. The team is spectacularly calm, and they clearly work together as a team. No one got uptight, despite being full up all night. Make a reservation because they have two seatings and then try to accommodate walk-ins. We go out A LOT, and this was a wonderful, completely unique experience, from the cocktails, to the food, to the atmosphere. Well done, Tiradito! For us, this is a must-do if you live in, or are travelling to, Montreal!"}
{"text":"I went on the second day of opening, I loved the vibe of this place. Nothing like the current Montreal food scene- modern with a warm loungy feel basked with warm lighting and carved wooden palm trees. The food and drinks go with this eccentric feel, punched with flavour and presentation. I give extra stars for the lovely staff that make any visit more personable- instant hit."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Tiradito, so when I ended up at an Airbnb literally next door, I knew I had to give it a try.   I was not disappointed. The restaurant itself has a welcoming vibe, more like a bar. The bar seating also makes it a great option for solo diners, even though there are plenty of couples and groups around too.   They seem to take their drink menu seriously, but I did not partake, so I can't comment on that. I was there for the food. After consulting with one of the helpful cook/waiters, I settled on three dishes: the eponymous tuna tiradito, the braised, then crisped chicharron, and the lobster causa. All were excellent, each a study in contrasts: the meaty tenderness of the tuna balanced with citric acidity and the crunch of roasted corn kernels; the melting tenderness of the pork shank paired with the fatty crispness of the skin; the richness of the lobster with the creaminess of the potato cups and the briny notes imparted by the tobiko.   I definitely look forward to a return visit here next time I'm thinking of heading close to Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Service here is terrible. They have about a million servers and they look like they are doing stuff, but all i know is that i had a 815 reservation, took ~40 min to get my drink and one dish. Finished everything at 915 and still sitting here at 955 waiting for my server to come around to get my bill, i don't think I've seen her in the last 30 min. Food is ok. Nothing special,  not sure if this is the best representation of Nikkei food. Only come here if you have tons of time to kill. Google says people spend 1.5-3 hrs here, i can believe the latter, im sure its because it takes forever"}
{"text":"Food was good: we tried the potatoes (very crispy and good), the octopus (good but not overwhelming), the tuna (the miso sauce was good but too strong for the raw fish), the quinoa salad (ordinary) and the ceviche (very good) but the portions are really small - disappointing  Too expensive for the overall quality."}
{"text":"I had originally planned to have dinner elsewhere, but when my beau saw that Tiradito was open he nearly pulled me over. We were quite hungry so I'm sure they thought we've never eaten before....I think we ended up ordering 7 different items. I started with a smokey mezcal cocktail called Ninmei en Peru...nicely strong, it nearly blew my sandals off! If you have a look at the photos it outlines our meal from start to finish....starting with the scallops and ending with the duck bun The scallop dish was basically a ceviche, and then our second dish was a fish ceviche, but it had a leche de tigre type sauce so it was different enough from the first. Both were light, slightly acidic and made us want more. Then we had the fried calamari \"nuggets\" and the blood sausage empanadas. The empanadas were the favorite dish of the night for my guy, he ordered another round for himself later. They were, as he put it, \"What empanadas should be!\" The calamari was good, not oily and crispy. We then had an octopus dish with an olive sauce, which is totally different from anything I've ever had and my favorite item of the night. We then had a round of steamed dumplings in a sweet and sour sauce, and a duck bao bun - which is an interesting choice for a Peruvian restaurant but they were really succulent and juicy. They seem to be working hard to make delicious food and drinks, go give them a visit."}
{"text":"Ils disent bouffe p√©ruvienne mais rien √† voir. Anticuchos de pulpo, m√™me pas un ingr√©dient d'un vrai anticucho. Tr√®s d√©cevant. Tr√®s cher pour rien."}
{"text":"I would give this establishment 5 stars but it is more casual.  I would recommend reservations.  This is a casual eatery with seating around the bar.  The food is mostly small plates which are meant to be shared.  I love this format as you can try numerous dishes.  The quality of the food was 5 star.  There are creative cocktails in addition to wine.  The staff was a bit slow at times but over all we had a comfortable pace to our evening.    The dishes are creative spins on traditional Peruvian Cuisine.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place to start an evening out."}
{"text":"It was my second time at Tiradito, and I remember liking it the first time I tried it out last year. I went on a Saturday night and it was not packed but it could have been due to the weather conditions not being great.   My cousin and I ordered the Sake Punch for two people which was very average and diluted.  We shared four dishes...the Albacore Tuna Tiradito, the octopus ceviche, the spicy cauliflower and spicy fried calamari. The tuna felt like it was just taken out of the freezer, the sauce was creamy and good but I didn't like the pairing of the sweet potato in that dish but that's just a personal preference.  I usually love octopus everything...fried, grilled, in ceviches...but the octopus in that dish was overcooked and chewy elastic like and the sauce was way too acidic, we didn't finish it. The cauliflower and fried calamari were good but nothing out of the ordinary.   We were full after but left quite unsatisfied. Hopefully it was just an \"¬†off¬†\" night for them."}
{"text":"Amazing food here! Had to wait because we didn't have a reservation, by the club next door was perfect with good cocktail selection. Tapas here are very tasty and as good as the ones I had in Peru! Def coming back when I visit mtl again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and unique cocktails. Loved the Peruvian-Japanese fusion concept. Note that seating might be difficult on a Friday or Saturday night because there are not many tables and most of the seating is at the bar. Worth a visit though!"}
{"text":"Randomly came across this restaurant with my boyfriend while visiting Montr√©al... and it was phenomenal!    My boyfriend is Peruvian, and he said it was some of the best ceviche he'd ever had. The chef even came out to talk to him for ten or twenty minutes (!)   The nicest, coolest staff, a really great atmosphere, and absolutely delicious food. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Elegantly plated and well executed. Didn't love that the person serving my food picked up a plastic container off the floor and kept using it. Didn't love that there were tons of fruit flies in my drink and around my food..."}
{"text":"We were blown away by this Peruvian-Asian fusion small plates restaurant on an unassuming street in Downtown Montreal.  Arriving around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, we were informed that all spots around the central bar were reserved, but they had 2 seats along the side wall. Perfecto!  The space is dimly lit with candles on the bar, and everything is tinged red by the rouge, luminous bird adorning the side wall. There are also plants and candles on the walls which balance the industrial vibe of the space.  All of the drinks on the cocktail menu sound so good. We went with the Chilcano which was tangy and fresh with pisco, ginger, lime, and passion fruit & the Maracuya Sour, a heavier, fruitier drink with passion fruit, tequila, and egg white. Both spectacular, we drank them much faster than we should have. Off to a great start!  For our dishes, we ordered the avocado causa, pato dumplings, and ceviche mixto. The dumplings arrived first, so we unwrapped our napkins and discovered that instead of forks or chopsticks, we were given SPORKS! Definitely unexpected and took a little getting used to (I have to admit I dropped more pieces of food than usual), but they made us slow our eating down and more thoroughly enjoy every bite.  The delectable duck dumplings in a sweet chili sauce were devoured, and then came the avocado causa, a creamy veggie dish with a deliciously creamy sauce, and the ceviche with tuna & avocado, which also came in a divine liquid. Now we understand the sporks! You can pierce the bite of food with the prongs and then fill the spoon portion with the sauce to get the perfect mouthful. Tiradito understands exactly how to bring the most flavor to your meal, and we truly appreciated every bite-- something that doesn't happen enough!  Tiradito caused us to slow down, enjoy each tasty detail, and feel really hip doing it. It's def a must in Montreal."}
{"text":"Service impeccable ! Nourriture merveilleuse ! J'ai ador√© le fait que lorsque votre service/repas est termin√©, il est possible de rester au restaurant et de simplement se d√©placer aux places r√©serv√©es √† cet effet, √ßa permet de terminer nos verres et ne pas se sentir \"mis √† la porte\" une fois le repas termin√© !  Bravo !"}
{"text":"Resto-bar convivial √† saveur p√©ruvienne, super chaleureux et cocktails sp√©cialis√©s. La carte des vins est tr√®s int√©ressantes. N'h√©sitez pas √† demander un Pisco Sour, qui n'appara√Æt pas sur le menu de cocktail."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Tiradito after reading many reviews. The place is beautiful - well appointed and thoughtfully designed. We found the service to be inconsistent - the hostess was chilly and the server was inexperienced and unable to describe menu items (there are not many to learn) or the wine list. Most importantly, the food fell flat.  Flavors were uninspired and didn't live up to our expectations. The pork shank was dry and over fried, the octopus leathery and the dumplings seemed to offer nothing more than you can get from a frozen grocery store brand. A bright spot - the cocktails.  They were beautiful and delicious. I wouldn't spring for dinner here again, but would have a cocktail."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Don't eat here unless you like MSG. You can taste the MSG and have the effect of frothy saliva in every bite. Cheap restaurants use MSG to compensate for lower quality ingredients. Every time I tried to order something it was unavailable. In other words, whoever is supposed to prep the food didn't do their job so I ordered the Squid and Papa Relleno. The Papa Relleno was tasty but not served hot. It was lukewarm. The Squid was worse. It reminded me of eating Show leather. I sent it back immediately and drank my crappy craft beer. Don't stop here, keep walking. Actually run away. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"If you're vegan/vegetarian try their Mango Ceviche ! Its really refreshing and surprisingly filling. My favorites were their Yuca Fries, Chica Morada (drinks and Alfajores for dessert. My husband and I had a great experience overall :)"}
{"text":"Sorry but they've gone downhill.  Bought a gift certificate but they can't track them even in the digital age.  No longer fun, reduced menu..  Bring the sexy back!!!!  Track your certs!!!  Customers keep you going!!!  Xoxo"}
{"text":"I highly recommend their mango ceviche! Came in one afternoon and not only was the music on point but the food was ah-mazing !"}
{"text":"What an experience! We came here for a date and were amazed by the restaurant - its character, its charm, its energy, its food, and its service.   Picture this: you're seated at a bar top (there're no tables). At the other side are three food preparation \"stations\" and a drink station, where the chefs serve up the tapas dishes. Despite the hustle and bustle, the chefs move with ease and unhurried grace. They do not just prepare the food. They chat with you, introduce the Peruvian- Japanese (Nikkei) dishes, serve up your tapas, clear your utensils when you're done... oh, and even present you your bill. Is there nothing they do not do? I would call them hosts, not just chefs.   The food is amazing. We had the cerviche, the duck in a bun, the beef / potato, and the pork. Very delicious, very fresh and beautifully presented.   For cocktail, we had the pisco sour. Pisco is the Peruvian liquor and not surprisingly it is used in many of the cocktails."}
{"text":"We were excited to go and on no hurry. but the service was so bad and so slow we left before finishing our meal. So did the table next to us.  A few examples: We waited about 20 minutes for our waitress to even come over. She was busy with a big table who was obviously going to give her a big tip. That's fine but just don't completely ignore us. We ordered our food and drinks.  40 minutes later we had received 2 items of food and no drink yet. We finally got her attention again and said should we check in at the bar for the drinks, she said yes that would be better for her.  Meanwhile she's taking shots with the other table and they have all had 3 drinks a piece in the time we had none.   We are fed up about another 30 minutes later when we ask for our check and instead of helping get us out of there and giving us our check our waitress goes and samples wine for the big group to bring them more drinks.   Also multiple places still had used dishes etc out there because they had no one to clean them up. It felt like about 5 people called in sick.   So here's my frustration, our table, the table behind us of 4 people, and the people in front of us another 2 people were all upset. When does someone recognize this from management and do something? I.e. Since this girl can't wait on all the tables then put someone else in charge of them? Or something.    It was incredibly disappointing. Food was good but completely overshadowed but the ridiculous service."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading about it on Eater Montreal. I was immediately appealed by the Peruvian-Japanese concept and cuisine. Went there on a Friday night with a friend of mine and of course made sure to reserve before we got there. As soon as we arrived we were immediately assigned two seats at the bar, the place looks really nice and trendy, with a big bar at the center and nice decoration. Music is not loud so you can easily have a conversation. The food menu is composed of seafood, vegetables and meat tapas to share. The food was very good and original, mixing salmon with mashed potatoes Peruvian style, as well as duck dumplings, tuna sushi, avocado with potatoes.. the staff and the barmaid were friendly. Very good experience overall, we paid 55$ each for 6 plates, one desert (really tasty) and a beer.  Small drawback: portions can be a little more generous."}
{"text":"The good? Nice decor for a drink after work or a laid back date. The service is friendly and the menu is original for the Montreal food scene. Very tasty to top things off. Everything we tried we quite enjoyed. Especially the boudin empanadas and the crab/avocado tostada! Rich in flavour, perfect pairing sauces.   The excellent? Drinks were to die for! Some serious mixology talent as they incorporate some Asian flair to Peruvian liquor. The bloody tiger, with its hints of sesame and some other umami flavour took the old Cesar to a whole other level!   The not so good? Portion were small and steeply priced considering their size. Although we would have loved to spend the night sampling the menu, the small portions cut our evening short as we were still hungry after forking out 30$ each for a drink and some dishes to share. We had to resort to good old Chinatown right next door to fill us up after we left."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this new spot right in the heart of Downtown Montreal. The food is fresh, the drinks are on point,  and the music & ambience is lovely. Chef Marcel Larrea has done it again; given the public an authentic gastronomic experience from his native homeland of Peru."}
{"text":"What a gem!!!! This Peruvian/Asian fusion restaurant/bar has everything in my books. It has an amazing vibe, (all bar seating, amazing music, cool decor), spectacular service (Santiago was so attentive and passionate) and the food was to die for! I went with my boyfriend for his birthday and we were blown away! We ate the octopus, the ceviche made with halibut, the BBQ duck buns, the dumplings, the Peruvian potatoes, and the tostada made with fresh crab. everything was ON POINT! Let's not forget the amazing cocktails. I had the passion fruit sour and he had the pismo sour. Both were delicious. I would recommend this place 100%! Perfect date spot or for a night out with good friends. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is definitely adult vibe.(they also don't allow kids). We really enjoyed the seafood dishes we ordered but less so the ones that were not as they felt too heavy. Really octopus tapas.   One neg was we were seated at the two ppl little table next to the wall and every 10 mins there was a violent shake from the wall...which we can only guess to be some kitchen machinery.....(or they are crushing a beast of some kind on the other side of the wall.)"}
{"text":"I loved my dinner at Tiradito! It's not very large, and all of the seating is around the U-shaped bar. Lights are a dim red, and the vibe is very cool. Some people are there for a meal while others for the cocktails. Moderately loud. The food comes out very quickly. The fusion of Peruvian with Japanese was so interesting, and everything was delicious. Don't miss the octopus antichucho, the crispy shrimps, and the papa rellena. Also super tasty were the Peruvian potatoes and the dumplings. Also very reasonably priced! Awesome restaurant that I highly recommend for anyone who's looking for a hip place and likes to step outside the box a little with their eats."}
{"text":"I treated a friend to dinner here recently.  From the outset this place pleases.  The ambiance and staff are warm and smart .  All the seats are all at a counter/bar top which turns out to be a congenial arrangement, placing you side by side with other diners and facing your waiter behind the bar. And then the food starts.  Delicious and varied small shared plates.  Our waiter and fellow diners guided us on what to order and we were so pleased we kept trying new dishes and ended up eating half the menu.  I can't wait to go back.  Thank you Tiradito."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and OMG. So let's start with an important piece of information. For a dinner, you'd be probably satisfied with 4 dishes at least, have that in mind, the dishes are supposed to be small so you can try a bit of everything.   I had the butifarra (holy molly, it's inspired on the Peruvian butifarra sandwich, but the twist is that they fill it with cantonese pulled duck and it's wrapped in a steamed bun) which was one of my favourite dishes, along with the octopus anticucho (came with a bit of causa). Then, I tasted the Peruvian Potatoes which were okay, nothing incredible. The causa was outstanding, made with lobster and topped with caviar.    I was disappointed with the ceviche, it was too salty and not enough lemony sour taste, it just didn't taste like ceviche. I went with my family and we are all Peruvian, so like the ceviche unfortunately didn't pass the test.   What blew our minds was the Passionfruit Lemongrass Chilcano, which came with a soursop cream deliciousness stuffed inside a lemon!! It pairs up really well with pisco and I need to drink it again.   Not all the servers speak Spanish and only a couple are Peruvian, but they were all cordial and helpful. The lighting is dimmed and red, so pictures of your food won't necessarily turn out great. I would definitely make a reservation because it gets busy (be mindful that most seats are at the bar) ! They also offer a birthday cake service, if you are planning to go there for the special occasion, plus you get free shots."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but I wasn't impressed. I do not plan on going back. In fact my colleagues are going and at first I said I was going to go but now i declined the invitation. The vibe is nice. I think it would be a good place to bring a date or just two girls out for a drink sharing some small plates. Basically everyone sits around the bar but they do have space in the back for larger groups. My cousin and I went on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I ordered the Bloody Tigre cocktail which is like a bloody Caesar and contains vodka, miso, coriander, hot pepper, marinated vegetables and a sechuan spice rim. I did not enjoy it! i forced myself to drink the whole thing. Reading the ingredients I thought I would like it  because I had the miso bloody caesar at Jellyfish and it was amazing! This one was bitter and sweet at the same time and too many marinated vegetables inside.   We ordered five dishes to share based on the recommendations of the staff. We had the smoked salmon causa (smoked salmon, maple syrup, potatoe and amarillo pepper). It was good but it tasted like any smoked salmon to me. I didn't taste the maple syrup at all but for me I prefer it that way because I'm not a big fan of salty and sweet. My favorite dish was the octopus anticucho. The octopus was deep fried and it had a creamy sauce but also Hoisin sauce as well. The Hoisin sauce is overpowering and being half chinese I'm used to eating Hosin so maybe that is why I liked this dish the best. We also had the Albacor Tuna Tiradito since that is what it is known for. Hmm it was ok... not memorable. The ceviche of the day was red snapper. OOF This was my least favorite dish. I took one bite and i couldn't eat the rest! what a waste!It was too fishy for me. For the record I like fish that doesn't taste like fish. Even my cousin couldn't eat her half either and she said it got fishier as she ate it. The papa rellena (potato, beef, sweet chili sauce) was fine. The beef was wrapped in big deep fried ball with a creamy sauce underneath. This restaurant seems to have a lot of deep fried stuff which I usually love! Like I said I really wanted to like this restaurant and I was excited to try it but I left feeling not satisfied. :("}
{"text":"Delicious Peruvian cuisine. It is extremely difficult and rare to find good Peruvian food here in Canada, but Tiradito nails it. As well, the service was amazing, and they prepared our ceviche right in front of us which is a plus. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We met a Peruvian couple at a dinner party a few weeks ago and asked them about their favorite Peruvian restaurant in Montreal. They highly recommended the recently opened Tiradito, and specifically recommended their \"fish\" dishes. They love Nikkei cuisine and Tiradito fit the bill perfectly.   This restaurant/bar is extremely popular so reservations are highly recommended. They have a 6 o'clock seating and an 8 o'clock seating.   After ordering our cocktails, our group of four ordered a mixture of dishes. Their fried foods were my favorite; I loved the octopus anticucho and peruvian potatoes. They both had the perfect amount of crispiness on the outside and a soft interior. The spicy cauliflower dish has a thai curry flavor to it. The avocado causa did not stand out particularly in my mind.   Our two ceviches ( mixed ceviche and fish ceviche) were good, but I am no expert on ceviche. We didn't order the albacore tuna tiradito but I really wished we had tried it. By the end, we were still a little hungry and so we each had a butifarra sandwich. This is very similar to Momofuku`s pork belly buns, it tasted like a steamed bun √† la Peking Duck. We finished off the dinner by splitting a dessert (the waiter was so kind he even split it into four plates for us!!)  It was the perfect way to end our dinner.    I loved that we ate with sporks, but when we requested an extra spoon to use for sharing the dishes (especially the soupier ones), they told us to just use our spork.  Couldn't they just spare one extra spoon?! Luckily we were all good friends... but still... hygiene is important guys...  The menu is short with very few vegetarian options.   Our vegan friend had to be creative and requested a vegetarian bun be made.  They were happy to accommodate and brought her a sweet potato steamed bun sandwich which she enjoyed. The waiters were all extremely friendly and genuinely happy to share their culture with us.   Overall, I had a very nice evening and I would be happy to return.  I loved the decor and ambiance. If you are a couple, you could sit at the bar and watch everyone at work. If you are a bigger group, there is a long communal counter with stools. One thing we noticed at the end of the night was that we were constantly looking for a place to rest our feet.  We were all looking for a non-existent beam under the table to rest our hanging legs on. Hopefully, they will install a wooden beam under the tables by the time I return for my next meal :)"}
{"text":"Petite d√©couverte de 2017 !  Un endroit tr√®s sympa et une cuisine diff√©rente.    Le concept d'avoir des places assises au comptoir entourant l'espaces o√π sont assembl√© les plats est particuli√®rement int√©ressant.  La cuisine d'inspiration p√©ruvienne ne vous laissera pas indiff√©rent, sans toutefois vous sortir de votre zone de confort (personne ne va vous servir des trucs vivants...)  Laissez-vous guider par votre serveur.  Le pisco-sour est tr√®s bon..."}
{"text":"Amazing foods and cocktails, and the atmosphere wonderful. A place to visit in Montreal, for me one of the best..."}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience there. Will not return. Food was overrated and overpriced. It's not a Peruvian-Japanese fusion, it's a Peruvian-CHINESE fusion! The food was served in a dim-sum fashion (small portion). Nothing innovative.   We were constantly interrupted by the waiters to order food and alcohol despite we were still working on what was served. We were asked to move even though the restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"Friendly staff (even on a busy evening) with great food and great drinks. What's not to love? So this is a fusion of Japanese and Peruvian, quite the combo. If you're a vegetarian, like me, enjoy the avocado causa or perucian potatoes and you're good to go. Careful though, two people can spend $120 easy here and not think twice about it. Their desert tastes ok, but I would say that's an area of the menu that could use improvement. Definitely stop by and give this place a shot. Make a reservation or hope you can get lucky, like we did!"}
{"text":"I had a pumpkin soup and tuna poke. My friend had the ceviche and she was happy. I have to say that this is one of the best poke salads I have had in Montreal.  The presentation and ingredients were excellent. The concept is pretty cool, where the waiter is also the chef and will prepare your meal in front of you.   Not your typical Peruvian restaurant and it is pricier than the usual hole in the wall. Located downtown near the old port. Pass by for lunch or dinner and make sure to reserve so you can get a good seat by the bar instead of sitting in front of the side wall facing a mirror.  Enjoy!"}
