{"text":"I'm so excited to have found this place! I've been searching for good Thai food in Cleveland for the past month (I'm from Chicago which has tons of amazing places that are easy to find). My co-workers and I ordered from here for lunch and everyone was very pleased.   I had the Pad Thai Country Style and it was delicious. Like the other reviewers I agree it is not very spicy at all, however it's still the best Pad Thai I've had in Cleveland by far. I also ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls with tofu- there was way too much lettuce and barely any tofu, probably wouldn't order them again... Oh well, I loved the entree and that's what I care most about!  I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Every dish I've tried has always been delicious, staff is very friendly and attentive, and they're neither too crowded nor dead during lunch or dinner hours. Prices are very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"This Thai food is more authentic than any other place in Cleveland. They have a pretty standard menu including the typical appetizers, fried noodles, chef specials, curries, and desserts.   I went there and got the drunken noodles which had great flat rice noodles with a good selection of vegetables, shrimp and chicken. The portion size is very good, bigger than other other Thai places including the 'new' Mint cafe, Peppermint, and Lemongrass. It could have used slightly more sauce, but that might be a matter of preference.   The wait staff were nice and courteous, the decoration was good.   In summary: The best tasting, most authentic Thai restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Execellent Thai food!! I could eat it all day long. The staff is very attentive and makes you feel like a guest in their home. A real treat to eat here."}
{"text":"Map of Thailand was excellent. Clean, contemporary decor and outstanding food and service. The drunken noodles, and green curry with chicken or duck were particularly good. BYOB worked out well"}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, my husband and I eat here at least once a week because it is always fast, fresh and absolutely delicious! Our favorites are pad see ew and massaman curry!! They don't offer alcoholic beverages but there's a Dave's across the street so you can grab something there first to enjoy with your meal if you so desire :) LOVE them."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times on weekdays around 3:00 pm and it is nice and quiet.  Usually only one other table of people if that.   I usually order salmon and vegetables with red curry and it is just the perfect amount for lunch.  The chicken coconut soup if very nice too.  I also steal wifi from Koko bakery next store.  hehe."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that the food was WAY too salty and I found some egg shells in my pad thai, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Don't expect too much. I have worked at a Thai bistro for two years and have very high expectations for Thai food. We tried the spring rolls, the Pad Thai and the green curry. The spring rolls tasted frozen. The Pad Thai with vegetables and tofu was bland and the sauce was clearish brown and gooey. The tofu had a weird sweet taste to it, and I couldn't tell how it was cooked. The vegetables in both dishes weren't fresh. The green curry looked like it came out of a packet from a supermarket. I thought it was charming at first that the place looks like an office building instead of a restaurant, but as it turns out, you can't expect much better than microwaved food from an office."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  I had a green curry with vegetables and it was just the perfect amount of spicy.  Everyone in my group agreed that the food was top notch.  The service was attentive.  The restaurant is spacious and clean.  I want to go back and try the pumpkin curry!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to the Cleveland Zoo and found this little gem for lunch. It has a decent size dining space and the staff are wonderful. We had our 7 year old with us, he wanted the beef noodle soup; our waitress said the portion was very large so she offered to charge us for just a small one and cut the amount. I thought it still seemed like a big bowl... The basil chicken was excellent and the seafood coconut soup was creamy and spicy. If you're in the Thai mood, don't hesitate to come here."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant. The staff is very friendly. Vicky is quick to remember repeat customers as well as what we have ordered on past visit. The staff also offers recommendations if you're not sure where to start. Just tell them what you like and you should find out quickly what meal will suit your taste. I love the Pad See Eu (with tofu). It's so good that I find myself dreaming about it. My partner gets something new every time we visit and has yet to be disappointed. The atmosphere is fresh, clean, and welcoming. If you miss Mint Cafe in Cleveland Heights / Coventry - try Map of Thailand, the staff and cooks are from Mint Cafe. Terrific experience every time."}
{"text":"As much as we like to try different restauranats, we are repeat diners at Map of Thailand for several reasons.  First, we really like the food.  For those who want it more \"Thai\" than Americanized, just say so!  Second, we enjoy the wonderful service of what we understand are 2 of the 3 owners:  \"Apple\" (the \"a\" in \"Map\") and Pop\" (the \"p\" in \"Map\". The third owner, \"M\", is unknown to us).    \"Apple\" (aka Vicky), with her interior decorating background, has done a lovely job of very effectively and tastefully decorating the restaurant.  The location works great for any downtown event or after-work meal and parking is easy there.   We have mixed feelings about recommending the restaurant since we don't want it to get too crowded. However, we do want them to continue to succeed and they deserve to do even more of a dinner business  (understand it is much busier at lunch). Take-out seems very popular there also. In good conscience, we have to spread the word and not let Map be a well-kept secret!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic dishes with a very friendly staff. The restaurant has a clean modern decor and a safe parking lot. I had the country Pad Thai - it had just the right item spice plus they added extra veggies since I'm a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I usually don't write a review but I had to write this time because of the nature of incident happened to me. The owner didn't like paying bills by card if it is below 10$ and included gratuity mentioning we were partying there, however we were colleague just joined during the lunch. When we asked, we received response that we don't pay tips, or some pay some don't ( I don't why it was that since tips is always added as part of good service or foods and not mandatory). Also customization of order didn't like by owner since few people are vegetarian and few are not. I hope they change attitude and greets the customers instead of making weird faces."}
{"text":"I ordered the drunken noodles for takeout and it was good. It's marked as spicy on the menu, but I guess it's spicy by Midwestern standards. Next time, I'll order it extra spicy.   They use really wide noodles and it's stir-fried with chicken and shrimp and veggies. The two small shrimp were kinda pointless and sad looking though. Lunch portion size was decent. Not large, but filling.  It was good enough for me to return to try more stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite. I come back again and again to Map of Thailand. Service is gracious. Food is delicious. My go to place for Thai every time."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a slow night. Nice atmosphere, good appetizers and tasty traditional Thai dishes. No liquor license."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Cleveland. You should eat here. Vicky is extremely nice and the food is always excellent."}
{"text":"The place is nice and quiet. We came for lunch and it was not busy at all. We had nothing but great experience when we're here. After lunch Koko Bakery is right next door, which is amazing."}
{"text":"Let me get all the basics out of the way so we can get to the food.   Parking not a problem- its right in front.  Place feels light, airy and upbeat.  Cut fresh flowers on the table, cloth napkins.  Staff very accommodating to customers.  Gluten free not a problem just let the waiter know.  Prices very reasonable.      Lets talk food.  My wife usually has a fear factor of places that serve hot spicy food. Good news they accommodate and serve to your liking.    There were two of us and came here by chance and glad we did.Leftovers  were excellent the next day.     In order at table side.    Golden Bags- little deep fried filled wonton with a very airy filling of pork with a side of a soy based sauce. VERY Good and flavorful.  Next came the Country Pad Thai which was very fresh and worked on the palate to entice you to order more.  The Drunken Noodles were wonderful and held their own with everything thing else that was going on.  The beef Satay was very well balanced in taste and flavor( a nice addition to the meal).  The Chicken With Red Curry was a nice warm tingle to the palate.  The Pad See-Eau (wide noodles with chicken, shrimp, and veggies) this was also another show stopper.    A lot of food for two people but leftovers are fine with me.      Go there. My wife and I will definitely be visiting them again.      P.S. the KOKO bakery is next door but thats for another time.       ENJOY !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"::Sigh::  Finally.  Really good Thai food in CLE.   It took me a long time to find you, but now that I have ....expect to see my face regularly.  Lunch prices are uber-reasonable.   Service is friendly.  Try the various noodle dishes.   Yellow curry is lick-the-plate-clean delicious.  Next stop-the bakery next door."}
{"text":"I really like this spot. Still searching for the best Thai in Cleveland but service is attentive and the mango fried rice is awesome! I wish it was more on the plate."}
{"text":"Killer pad thai and basil fried rice wish they have chili deep fried red snapper which is my favorite thai food"}
{"text":"I'm a fanatical Thai foodie and this is probably my favorite Thai place in Cleveland.  I come here often and the staff is consistent and knows me.  It took a few visits, but I finally reached a point with the servers that I can get the strong spice level that I like and the curry dishes always come out amazing!  Good for a fast, yes extremely tasty and spicy business lunch.  Small, clean and efficient operation. My \"go to\" Thai place in/near downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place with very good Thai food.  The only thing to know is if you have a strict lunch hour call ahead for carry-out as the service can be a bit slow if you eat in."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Cleveland, hands down. The owners may be the two nicest women I've ever met and always go out their way to make sure you have a great experience.  Order the map string bean with extra sauce. It's unreal."}
{"text":"Came from Erie for our Annual Regional Convention in Cleveland and Yelp helped us to spot this place, it's out of the beaten path but it's full of charm, super clean and cute we ordered Cashew  Chicken, pad Thai and the Thai Red Curry, they were all sooo delicious! Service was friendly and food came fast! Nice portion, beautifully plated! We're happy campers"}
{"text":"The best Pad Thai I have ever tasted.  There are many other delicious items on the menu, like the Drunken Noodle or the Golden Bags, but I cannot help from ordering this almost every time. I order the 'Country' Pad Thai which is slightly different than the house pad thai. It is sweet and spicy and a little crisper and browner. The service is always pleasant and efficient. I can also be a bit picky about the ambience of a place and MOT has it all. Great light in the afternoon from a big window that makes one of the four walls of the dining area.   They do not have a liquor license here, however you can BYOB."}
{"text":"So delicious. I've been looking for good, authentic Thai cuisine since I moved to Cleveland. And indeed, I have! At last! I went with my sister when she came to visit me. We got the Drunken Noddles and substituted the chicken for duck, an extra $3.00 charge. But well worth it. It's situated in Cleveland's Asiatown, which isn't the best neighborhood. But the interiorr decor was pleasant and the food delicious. Reminded me of my favorite Thai place in Boston. And the service was quick, warm and friendly. An absolute pleasure!"}
{"text":"Definitely deserving of its high rating. Every dish was delicious: country pad thai, red curry, and crispy duck. Delicate flavors, fresh vegetables cooked perfectly, and high quality meat and seafood. Service was well-timed and friendly. The dining room is spare but clean and pleasant. No alcohol served but you can bring your own wine. All-around great place for an excellent Thai meal."}
{"text":"Tasty larb, although it was spicier than I expected for one star. Pad see ew also good. Nice dining room and good parking outside."}
{"text":"Hello yelpers!!!! I never review any restaurants before cos I think sometime when I read other reviews especially the really bad one i'm Not sure if is it true but what I experienced today made me think that sometime it's not so fair for restaurant owner for those bad reviews. I was dine in at Map of Thailand today and I sat quite close enough to hear almost every conversation between waitress and some cheap customers who sat by the window. And the last words I heard they said was \"we will write  bad review for you\" and that made me have to wait and see if they will really do it. And they did ( at least I saw 3 reviews so far) !!! but the bottom line is they didn't tell 100% truth like what I heard. For example. 1. One of them said that they will charge you if you have party more than 4 which I heard and saw the waitress did show them that it was shown on the menu that if you have party more than four, 18% gratuity will be added and I think almost all of the restaurant have those kind of policy and I think there is nothing wrong with that.  2. Some of them said that when they eat there they were sick , the kitchen sucks and lacks of hygine but why do you keep coming back to eat there ( I know it because I am a regular customer there especially on Friday at luch) I saw them quite a lot on Friday. Lol 3. One of them mentioned that servers don't understand English but I don't think so they are very educated people and I never had once problem ordering with them.  4. One of them said that customers always right, but in this case I don't think so, cos you guys are totally wrong!!! We always know that if we want to dine in at the restaurant we need to give them at least 10% tip if you don't satisfy but for me I always give at least 18 -20 % cos I was once working as a waiter. But you don't even tip them ,Come on!!! Where are you guys from!!!! And again why I saw you guys at least 4 times there if you don't happy with them!!! You have the right to not coming back if you don't like them!!! (And I over heard that they have been there for 3 years, and why you get upset when they first charge you gratuity in 3 years, it makes me feel so sorry for the owner that you dine in there for 3 years and never tip!!!)  5. One of them said they have to eat at Map of Thailand cos there don't have  no where else to go, let me tell you!! There are at least  3 restaurants surrounding there for example , Han grill next door, superior pho, li wah but you keep coming back here (at least 4 times that I saw you guys) cos you like the food!!      The bottom line is that if cheap customers like you guys don't want to tip when you dine in, why don't you guys just pack your luch and eat at your office!!  If you want to give a review please please please tell the truth!!!   FYI... you don't have to believe me but at least I think I have to speak out when I saw something wasn't right like this case... I still love coming to Map of Thailand and I encourage everyone to have a great experience like I always have there and it will be the only thing to proof about what I said and what they said.. don't let those fake reviews fool you.."}
{"text":"i read all the reviews and chose this place- i ordered the pad thai and drunken noodles to go. i have tried pad thai (it's my favorite) all over- from San Fran, DC to Erie. However, this had next to no flavor. i was so disappointed- it had no spices, flavor, color, and no lime to even add flavor. the only way i was able to eat it was by adding extra peanuts. the drunken noodles were better, flavor wise even decent. the only downside was that there were 3 big noodles (no exaggeration). the rest were some veggies. this was dinner portion. i don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Great food served by friendly caring staff. Authentic Thai food!!! Obviously a well thought out menu. A very elegant, modern, clean atmosphere gives such a pleasant dining experience. Very highly recommended. Worth the drive. One of the best things is, this place is all about the eating experience. Thankfully, it does not have a TV distracting you from the social dining experience."}
{"text":"It is delish. The drunken noodle dish is amazing. It has both shrimp & chicken. Nice clean and cozy atmosphere. Plus the price is very reasonable for the Quilty!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The mango fried rice is so tasty and is perfect for lunch or dinner. I enjoyed their chicken coconut soup, once I got past the color - white soup with white mushrooms and white chicken. A little color in there would make it more appealing. The hostess was the kindest I've probably ever experienced!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin curry with shrimp is as good as it can possibly get. And the service is spot on. This little gem of a restaurant continues to sparkle."}
{"text":"Here is small place but clean and nice. I love Tom yum soup so of course I ordered. It was okay. I wanted more ethnic taste. Entrees was good. But I think it's not enough size for men. Women can eat all.  Still I like this place!"}
{"text":"The band tennis was eating here at the SAME time we visited this fine establishment! The lemongrass special was the best thing on this here spaceship earth. Keep up the great work! I WILL be back"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Map of Thailand about 5 times (just went Sat. 01/07/12), and i have been there 3 additional times with co-workers for lunch.  Vicki is a wonderful host, and the food is delicious.  The best Thai I have tasted, and I've sampled quite a bit in several different states (a close second is Port Royal S.C.).  I don't like things spicy, and the mild spiced items are just enough for me.  The tofu bag appetizer is unbelievable, and the coconut soup is just as unbelievable.  We frequent China Town a lot, but our favorite spot is Map of Thailand.  I can't believe they were not even considered for Best Thai in the Fox 8 poll.  Hopefully they can make it next year!!!  Keep up the good work Vicki."}
{"text":"I only had 45 minutes to eat and go.  I didn't know if that would be enough time.  It was. They had me in and out in twenty minutes.  I had to find a way to kill twenty-five minutes. I ordered a Thai Iced Tea- $2.50- it was delicious, kind of smokey.  They made a flower out of the straw wrapper.  Very cool, (you might have to tap on he pic to see.) Appetizer was Beef Jerky, $5.95.  Never saw that on a menu before, so I ordered it.  It tasted like fried beef jerky with spicy peanut sauce for dipping. It was fun to try but I wouldn't order it again.  Then I had Duck with red curry, $7.95.  I liked it- that's it.  Not great.  It was ok, ( \"ok\" spelled out is \"okay.\"  Actually means \"All Correct,\") but I thought the sauce was a little bland, the rice wasn't sticky enough, but more of a problem was the duck was limp and mushy.  It should be seared and crisp.  The vegetables were too fresh- no sear on them either.   But the service was so quick, it worked for me. If they made it really good, I would have been late for my appointment.  So kudos on your mediocre Thai food and FAST service."}
{"text":"Having eaten a lot of Thai food this one is definetly one of the better places I've been.  Ambiance was problably the best I've seen for a Thai place.  Got the Drunken Noodles, Panang Curry, and Thai Basil with a couple of friends -- a standard triad of we chose because of a Thai newbie we had with us.  The noodles were delicious wide noodles in a mild spiced sauce.  The panang was tasty with the curry having not separated, like many other places -- gross.. And the thai basil a burst of excellent flavor and a great addition of fried basil as a textured element on top.  The servings initially seemed small but filled three hungry guys -- all for around 30$.  Service was good, no complaints.  If you're in the area I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Having been to Chiang Mai and eaten dozens of bowls of kao soi, this is authentic as kao soi you will find in Cleveland. It was incredible! And enormous! Holy smokes if you haven't eaten a bowl of kao soi, plan your next trip right now. And BYOB!"}
{"text":"I decided to wait to review this restaurant until after I had eaten here three times.   I can honestly say that I have been extremely happy with the food, service and over all experience of eating here each time.  I have been here twice for lunch and once for dinner.  The curry dishes are amazing but I do hope to explore the menu a bit more.    I highly recommend Map of Thailand"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and amazing food for a ridiculous price.  They even made me mint iced tea on my first visit, not on the menu, and brought it to me every visit after with out asking.    The satay, the coconut soup, and country pad tai are all time favorites."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere & good service. Good Thai food but similar to other Thai in Cleveland area. Prices were reasonable. Basil fried rice & red curry were good- wish they had been spicier."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place! Little bit nicer than casual but not too fancy you feel weird just popping in. The beef jerky app is just insanely delicious. Sooooooooo tender and flavorful. Every dish I have tried is a winner. My favorite is the salmon choo chee and my husband loves the duck soup. Kids like the mango fried rice too. Service has always been excellent. If you are in the area, this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"Love the curry recipes, the pad Thai was a tad too sweet. The lemongrass tea was very nice."}
{"text":"My favorite hot and sour soup. Pad Thai is super good. Drunken noodle is the best. Also this pad Thai curry is amazing! Prices are good. I was one of their first customers since they opened and still loyal now."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai place in a quiet area. The employees are very friendly. Food is pretty good, but if you want spicy, you have to say how spicy you want your dish to be even if it says spicy."}
{"text":"A great restaurant in Little China in Cleveland!  My fav is Coconut Shrimp Soup!  Very nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Meals are so appealing!   Great change of pace instead of eating fast food.  Made fresh and wholesome!  Served with kindness and pleasure!  I will be going back again for a third time!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  My gf and I came here to try it out on a Saturday night.  The place was pretty empty, but we still decided to try the place.  The service was okay; the waiter was sitting at a laptop computer at one of the tables and occasionally checked in on us.    The food tasted pretty good but wasn't very spicy.  Though we asked for level 2 out of 3, it didn't even give a whiff of spiciness.  But maybe it just means that I need to ask for a much higher level spice level than they serve."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for work and found this hidden gem.  Being a person who wants authentic Thai food, I got it.  The place is very clean with great service and food was full of flavor."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from out of town and wanted Thai food.   I checked yelp and this place was first on the list in the area we were staying.   We started with the Pad Thai which was excellent.  Great noodles and it included chicken and shrimp in the dish.   I had the chicken red curry which I asked to be spiced up more then normal.   It came out excellent.   The chicken was tender and the veggies were fresh.   My wife order yellow curry.   She loved it.  It was mild in spice and again the veggies were fresh.   The sauce was creamy and had a great flavor.   We both had brown rice with our dish.   The waitress was extremely nice.   We will be visiting again when we come back to town."}
{"text":"I had the Drunken Noodles and Penang curry, both excellent. Great work guys!"}
{"text":"My wife and I chose to stop here for an early dinner. This is the best Thai food we have had in this area. The space itself is clean and warm; the hostess and waitstaff very friendly and helpful. We had the crispy tofu baskets and dumplings for appetizers. Both were excellent, especially the dipping sauces. Both the chicken coconut and seafood coconut soups were great, fragrant and flavorful. We had the larb salad and country pad thai. We would endorse both! We will be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"really good prices, and very very friendly servers. i had a spectacular meal here, and the atmosphere was very good. the menu is pretty customizable, and has a wide array of tasty options. we only did the lunch special, but that being said i was very impressed with the prices. only 4/5 because the portion sizes were very, very small. i wish they were bigger, but i guess that's what happens with a lunch special. still very good, and the waitress was spectacular about splitting the check."}
{"text":"From the helpful staff to the food there's nothing that is lacking in this restaurant. I've eaten here three times and I've never had a bad experience. The staff is very friendly and attentive, and the mood is always calm and relaxing.   The menu seems very fresh and they're always changing things up and adding new things that never disappoint.   As far as the menu goes, I've never ordered anything I didn't like. Some of my favorite things are: the thai papaya salad, the chicken satay and the crispy veggie rolls for appetizers. For the main course, I always want the pad thai! Always fresh and delicious, but this last time I tried the Golden bags (friend wonton) and it was just as good as I expected."}
{"text":"I decided to edit this because I originally made the review back in October and things have changed. My husband is addicted to this restaurant. In fact, I was nice enough to order take out so he could get a mid week fix. We go every Saturday and Sunday. This of course gives them additional brownie points as we both never just order a dish and they have us memorized. The decor is nice, classy, and clean. It doesn't look or feel cluttered or cheap inside. Apparently, it is BYOB. If you do wine pairings- be prepared. The food is so flavorful and complex. A simple merlot isn't going to cut it.  Now on to the food. First- they will adjust almost anything for you. If you're a wuss like, me- just tell them. Grew up sucking on ghost chillies? Tell them. They also have this great chili powder that tastes so good it is worth the heat (again, this is coming from a wuss. My husband thinks the heat is great).  Here is a list of the food and drinks we've had and liked. (Hubby's dishes have a * for spicy.) Thai Iced Tea, Tropical Smoothie, Lychee Smoothie Chicken Satay, Beef Satay, Beef Jerky, Thai Curry Puffs (special) **Drunken Noodles, pad see ew, country pad thai** Larb, Thai Beef Salad, Pineapple Fried Rice, Map String Beans, Yellow curry with chicken or beef  On to the service! Vicky and Pop are attentive but don't rush you. My water class never becomes empty and they have a good pace between appetizers being served and main courses. They happily describe dishes and I have never heard them complain about a special request. I once saw Vicky bend down and walk an older man through the menu because it was his first time.  Basically, I cannot sing enough praises for this restaurant. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. (Oh, I think all the negative reviews are from people that don't realize that this is a restaurant and not a psychic parlor. If you want something done a certain way- ask. Don't assume that they will read your mind.)"}
{"text":"Drunken noodles for lunch - very good. Asked for extra hot and was just med. hot but still very flavorful. Would go back."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt some of the best Thai food in Cleveland. Highly recommend it. We had chicken satay,  soup, two dinners, 1 Pad Thaii, one Massaman curry. All very good."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time last Friday for lunch and liked it so much I went back this past Monday for lunch and ordered the exact same thing.  Working in the heart of Cleveland's AsiaTown I can walk to Map of Thailand from my office and now that I'm officially in the loop on how good it is I can't wait to continue my lunch domination there.  The service is wickedly quick and I find the prices very affordable, I would play $2 to $4 more per lunch item and not bat an eye at the price - this is a good thing though because then I can add the fresh shrimp rolls (2 for like $3.75 or something) to my Country Style Pad Thai lunch order.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this meal that I may have to stop by again tomorrow.  I've heard from some folks that there can be quite a line at times to get a table but both times I've dined there I went early enough in the lunch hour that I was quickly seated and served.  I already know what I'm getting next, the Mango Fried Rice, which one of my colleagues got this past week, it was fresh, the perfect size and the staff accommodated all of her special requests without a second guess.  I also noticed lots of folks coming in for take out orders which is good for their business as well - I hope it succeeds!"}
{"text":"I went here for an early dinner with my family. The Green Curry Tofu and Pad-See-Eu (my favorite dish) were both amazingly delicious and fresh. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere calm and relaxing.  The bill for four dinners and an appetizer was definitely budget-friendly. I will definitely be coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"Almost every lunch entrée on the menu is under $8. Portion size is perfect, filling but not overwhelming. Plated entrées are full of vibrant colors and have great depth of flavor with exquisite aromas and spices. Service is understated and attentive. I also like that the restaurant is on the small side with maybe 10-15 tables, which for me, makes it feel comfortable."}
{"text":"My friend and I found this place by accident, but my lemongrass chicken was incredibly tasty, and we count it as a lucky accident. Hope you decide to go there deliberately; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5! I'll be back to eat more though.  My only complaint... the food could have been a little spicier!   I came here with some friends and we had the tom yum soup, spring rolls, country style pad thai, basil beef and seafood green curry. The pad thai was especially tasty (it IS my comfort food...)   The decor was really nice - clean, good spacing, and nice wall sticks. :)  The service was great; waitresses came at the right time during our lively discussions. I really want this place to succeed!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not enough people write reviews in Cleveland on Yelp, causing this place to only have a total of less than 10 reviews.  I really like this place since it's at a convenient location for me and not too expensive. I love Thai food...especially after visiting Thai 4 times and staying there for over a month one time.  Compare to the REAL Thailand food, this is definitely a mild version of it. No where as spicy or sour. But since we are eating in the States, they have to make it so that the American stomaches will be able to enjoy it.  I loveeeeee their fried rices!! Love pretty much anyone of them. But of course the ones with the STARS (means it's spicy) get my attention first. I love spicy, the more the merrier. The reason I love the fried rice is because it always come out still hot. Other dishes may come out warm, but the fried rice will be hot. Not the type of hot that'll burn your turn, but just hot enough to make you drool!  Their curries are decent if you like curry. Honestly, I think curries are very similar anywhere and everywhere. Thailand or the States, same difference to me."}
{"text":"Not the best thai place in cleveland but definitely worth giving it a try. I always enjoy my country style pad thai. I feel like the portions here were small for the price range compared to other thai locations. The food quality was about medium and it did fill my pad thai craving."}
{"text":"Almost ever time I'm in Cleveland, I have to stop here for \"map beans.\" I don't even like beans at other places! When I know that I am going for a visit, I dream about this dish for a week in anticipation!"}
{"text":"Map of Thailand is a very great spot for flavorful Thai dishes, and is a fantastic spot for lunch because the prices and portions are just right. Service was quick, friendly, and the atmosphere is clean and simple.  Homemade Jerky is a unique, delicious, and light appetizer to split between two before  entrees.   I enjoyed the yellow curry and BF enjoyed the pad thai at medium heat."}
{"text":"I want to thank Yelp for helping me find this place.  This is a great little restaurant hidden away in a mini Asian plaza on Payne.    The inside of the restaurant is very clean and modern and the service is quick and friendly.  I have dined in for lunch but mainly come here once a week for takeout.    Their lunch portions are reasonably sized and are priced at about average for the area.  Some of my go to options are their Mango Curry and Pad Thai.    The Mango Curry has just the slightest bit of heat that will bring a tingle to your lips and a warm glow in your tummy.  It's very creamy with a spicy sweet taste that I just can't get enough of!  The Pad Thai is also very tasty but a tiny bit too sweet for me.  I've also sampled their Thai Beef Salad which is refreshing with a good hit of spice in every bite.    Be sure to try the Satay appetizer because a good peanut sauce is worth its weight in gold.  Needless to say I'm a fan of this place.  If you work or live in the area it is definitely  worth a visit.  I no longer work downtown and will sorely miss this lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been moved to write this review because its just that good! I'm literally eating at this restaurant right now. I ordered the old fashioned pad Thai and I love it. Nicest decor for any strictly Thai restaurant I've visited.  I will visit every chance when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had the Fresh Rolls for an appetizer, they were good but could have used a little more flavor. I enjoyed the peanut sauce that came with it.  I had the Pad Thai for my meal and it was delicious. The peanut flavor was phenomenal, the dish didn't lack any flavor. The portion was plenty to fill up an adult male.  The service was quick. I was with 1 other person at prime lunch time and was in and out in 30minutes. I got my food about 5 minutes after ordering. I definitely recommend this place to anybody if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fresh, delicious,Thai food served by a friendly staff.  This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland hands down."}
{"text":"This is a nice space. Very attractive.  I had a basil beef extra spicy. It was pretty good. Nice bite, not crazy hot. The gf had Pad Thai. She was not impressed. I thought the noodles were ok. She thought they were a bit clumpy. They were kind of stuck together. The chicken in her Pad Thai was bland and way over cooked.  Spring rolls with sweet potato were an unexpected surprise.   I will definitely give it another go. The gf, probably not. The upside for me is a lot of Pad Thai leftovers for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best Thai food anywhere! Service is fast, friendly, and efficient. Prices are very reasonable. My favorites include the Thai Spring Roll and Shrimp Cracker Roll appetizers, the Pad Thai Country Style, Thai Style Basil, Shrimp Fantasy, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Duck with Red Curry Sauce. Can't get enough of Vicky and the Map of Thailand. Give it a try. They don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"First if all let me begin by saying i would have given it zero stars if possible. However i do have to select atleast 1 star. The service and the attitude of the waiters in this place is not at all friendly. Moreover we just learnt we cant even customize our foods and if we do then we are charged extra . Also they abruptly charge grautity as 18% even if we are not happy with the service. I would strongly recommend against going to this place"}
{"text":"So before we get into the food, let's talk about the setting. Although it's in a sorta sketchy part of town, this place is bright, has lots of Windows and more modern decor. I would go as far as to say that it feels clean! Yes! Clean!   The service is pretty fast and generally friendly- not too friendly, mind you.   Full disclosure- I've only been here for lunch... And the menu is pretty big. How to choose what you want?! Fortunately I go with close friends, so we share dishes. (I'd highly recommend this plan of attack).   I've sampled the drunken noodles (amazingggg), the country pad Thai (yummy) and the yellow curry with brown rice (quite delicious). Every entree we have gotten costs around $8; not too shabby. The portion sizes, unlike many Asian restaurants, are reasonably sized. In fact; when I got my curry, I thought, \"darn! I won't have leftovers!\" Sure enough... No leftovers... But I left feeling quite satisfied.   Map of Thailand- I will not need a map to find my way back to you again!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Great service. Ordered the Map String Beans (crispy string beans with chicken, cashew nuts and peppers in a ground peanut curry sauce).....the best ever!!!  Also, ordered the Tom Kha Kai (coconut cream base soup with chicken)....fantastic!!  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I had their shrimp pad thai and pineapple fried rice!!! It was delicious 5/5. Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean, and food is tasty. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Map of Thailand is a favorite lunch spot for me and my coworkers. A good variety of dishes to appeal all types of eaters.   Favorites among our group: Golden Bags appetizer (tofu skin purse dumplings) Country style Pad Thai (slightly spicier version of their normal Pad Thai). Basil chicken fried rice   What I love about this restaurant is not only the food, but also the atmosphere and the staff. It's always clean, tables have actual tablecloths, nice glasses, etc. The staff is always attentive and pleasant. It's usually the same servers (a man and a woman) and even with just going there maybe once a month, they recognize us and greet us by name.   Have had the rare occurrence where our order was incorrect, but they were quick to correct at no charge. No complaints about Map of Thailand."}
{"text":"After one too many meals of fried foods, I knew it was time to hit up some Asian eats on my visit to Cleveland. A quick Yelp search pulls up Map of Thailand as one of the few options open on a Sunday evening.  We head on down Payne street and it seems a bit desolate and notice only one vehicle in Map of Thailand's parking lot.  Normally that would be a huge warning sign to me but what the heck!    Inside there are two gentlemen running the restaurant, it's a small space.  Maybe 10 - 12 tables with a subdued decor and lighting, much nicer on the inside than you would expect from the outside.  Cut fresh flowers on the table, cloth napkins, perfect for a quiet dinner or date.  I order up some fresh basil rolls and basil chicken.  The basil rolls are served with a dark peanut sauce and it's all quite good.  My chicken basil comes with a cone of jasmine rice.  The dish is well spiced with plenty of peppers and onions, a nice version for $10.  And I don't want to stop just yet so I grab some sticky rice with mango which comes with quite a bit of coconut milk and half a mango.  Very nice but the mango needed a bit more ripening.   Service at Map of Thailand is very well done.  Attentive and speedy without being rushed.  Overall it's a good dinner and a good rendition of Thai food.  And for the price, decor and service, you could do far worse than Map of Thailand!  So enjoy this little ethnic eatery and don't let the outside fool ya!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch one day. I don't have much experience with Thai, but I'm definitely interested after eating here. The food was delicious. I got the Massaman Curry. Super good, not spicy because I don't like that. Thai spring roll appetizer was good too. The waiter said they're the only business around that makes real \"Thai Thai\" not Chinese Thai or Indian Thai. Simple small place but good service and great food. Worth a try even if you've never had Thai before."}
{"text":"After spending time in Thailand in 2010 (where my host family cooked at least 4 different dishes at every meal) I returned to Cleveland in search of great Thai food. After trying most restaurants in the area, I came across Map of Thailand and have not gone anywhere else since. Vicky, the owner, and I got to talking about my visit and the true intricacies of the Thai dinning experience - Thais don't eat with chopsticks, they use a spoon as the main utensil while using a fork to assist the food on the spoon, or use their fingers with sticky rice! She knows I like spice, so most of my ordered dishes (Thai Style Basil or Green Curry Chicken) come with a spice level 10 -just ask her to adjust as needed. She also brings out a small cup of hot chillies in fish sauce to add to the dish if needed! I also have sticky rice with my meal that comes in a small Thai rice box.   While completing my doctoral studies at Cleveland State, I was able to eat at MOT on a regular basis. Now my visits are monthly prior to attending theater downtown! I have introduced many friends, colleagues, and family members to this place and none have been disappointed!  This really is a great place to eat. The dinning room is contemporary and a wonderful place to actually have a conversation  and not get blared out by music. They don't have a liquor license, but you can bring your own with no corking fee.  My only regret is that I have waited so long to post a way overdue positive review of this place."}
{"text":"Hello food lovers .... this place boasts about food and service only because there is NO freaking decent place to eat nearby .... it's in the dark corners of East Cleveland . If you are party of 2 u will prob get food quick. The kitchen sucks and they have extremely low hygiene  . I had stomach flu when I ate there .   Moreover , they charge you atrocious amount of gratuity without letting you know . If you are party of 4 or more BE ready to wait for 45 mins atleast . They just can't handle people   There charge for cheap food more than it's worth let's put it that way.  Servers can't speak or understand English and they mess your order if you try to be creative with food .   OVERALL NOT A PLACE  TO EAT IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE .?"}
{"text":"Their Country Pad Thai is practically orgasmic.  A few bites has me moaning in pleasure.  It's the best Pad Thai I've had anywhere and it's close enough to downtown to pick up for lunch (if you drive).  I have to have it at least once a week.  The pickup service is excellent as well, it's always ready on time and piping hot.  I love the food so much, I really aught to dine in once in awhile.  Update:  What started as my favorite Thai restaurant downtown quickly became my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland, period.  After first falling in love with their Pad Thai (Country-style), I branched out into their curries and other dishes.  I have tried every regular curry and most of the special curries now and I have enjoyed every single one.  This is a restaurant that rewards you for experimenting with the menu because everything you order turns out to be tasty and delicious!  If you've never had Thai curry before, I strongly recommend them, they are very different from Indian curries.  Also, don't let the stereotype fool you, none of them are very spicy-hot.    The restaurant is small but nice, well lit, and clean.  The prices are great, especially the lunch specials which are very reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive.  The staff is wonderful, too.  They are some of the nicest, friendliest people.  They always greet me with a smile, sometimes even by name.  It's always a pleasure to visit their restaurant.  If you live in Cleveland and you like Thai food, you owe it to yourself to come visit this amazing little place.  I fell in love, I think you will, too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the yellow curry and my dad had the pad Thai. The pad Thai was excellent I definitely recommend it I loved the todo in it and if was the perfect amount of food. The yellow curry was pretty good. I thought the flavors were great and it had a nice presentation but there definitely could have been more food on my plate compared to the average size at other restaurants. All in all not the worst cleveland thai food experience."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed my dinner here. From the moment you walk in there's a significant change from the vibes outside. The decor and setting is perfect to enjoy such a nice Thai dish. I like the fact that being a party of one and because of the lack (not the right term, but you get it) of a bar that I was sat at a table and was truly able to just relax and absorb the ambiance and my delicious feast!"}
{"text":"I was really exited about this place because I've heard and tasted great things. Very disappointed how skimpy be meat and tofu are in my order. As you can see in the pix, I basically have an order of noodles that would have been better if they had an adequate portion of meat and tofu included. It's also not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Map of Thailand has flavorful Thai food. Loved the Soups and beef satay. Reasonably priced.  Prompt service."}
{"text":"The best Thai food ever. If you want Thai food in Cleveland, look no further. I had many versions of red curry at different places including one place in San Francisco, but this place beats them all: had the red curry with tender and juicy duck, so delicious!"}
{"text":"Truly an exceptional gem in cleveland that reflects the ability to not only bring Thailand to cleveland but still be brought true to Thailand food culture. Nothing short of a beautiful gem that anyone in cleveland seeking thai food should visit and experience. Truly a wonder"}
{"text":"Every city that I move to, I try to find a place that serves good Pad Thai and it normally takes me 5 or 6 tries until a find a good place. I lucked out when this was my first place to visit in Cleveland and the Pad Thai was great. It was a large portion, had chicken and shrimp, and it has just the right amount of peanut taste. I'll definitely be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I almost always go to Koko's next door and never set food in Map of Thailand, but that changed recently. A coworker and I were on our way to the Yelp! Elite event at J and C Glass studio and decided to grab dinner first.   We split the beef salad, an order of summer rolls, the green papaya salad, and two different types of curries.   Out of them all, the beef salad was the winner for the night. The veggies were crisp, the beef was very well seasoned and the sauce over it all made my toes curl.   The curries were both very good. Both were seafood based (I'd love to tell you the names of them, but I don't honestly recall), and the scallops kicked ass. They were larger than half-dollars and very fresh.   Service was a bit slow, but good. The gentleman waiting on us didn't do so well, but was just peachy when I pointed at items on the menu. Maybe I'm pronouncing things wrong?  Not a place I'd drive up to Cleveland specifically for, but if I'm ever in the area again, I'd be happy to stop."}
{"text":"The pad thai here is amazing and the employees are super friendly. Best thai restaurant in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Nice place, has an upscale atmosphere and the service was great.  My husband and I ordered a tom yum soup to share, I ordered red curry and he ordered a northern Thailand dish that was really good.  When the tom yum came out, I was scared for the rest of the meal.  The tom yum soup was horrible, I am sorry, but it was just horrible. I don't know if there was too much fish sauce or what but I could not even stand the smell of it sitting at the table.  There was nothing else in the soup besides the broth and chicken.  The entrees came out and I was relieved they were pretty good! The spice level was good (i like spicy, it could have been a little spicier) and the portion size was plenty. I ate all of mine, and we took some of the other dish to go."}
{"text":"The service was great. Everyone was very friendly. It wasn't too busy so I received my food rather quickly (lunch time). I had the Pad Thai Country Style and Golden Bags. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS and plentiful. Will return."}
{"text":"Food taste won't be the best among Thai restaurants in Cleveland area, but I think it's alright. The most complaint from me is sizes of dishes are kind of small."}
{"text":"Map of Thailand has fast and plesant service, and such a cute place to eat! The entrees are reasonably priced. We had the Pad See-Eau and the Red Curry with Duck, it was very well presented, hot and delicious! Also the soups are REALLY REALLY good, Tum Yum King and Seafood Coconut Soup.... absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Lunch here is really good! A variety of authentic appetizers and entrees, the portion is definitely enough! The taste is good too! Not Americanized Thai food! Very good and original!"}
{"text":"Map of Thailand Restaurant (located next to KoKo Bakery) opened a few weeks ago.  The food is very tasty, the decor is nice, and the service is outstanding.   We had lunch there the first week, and got carry-out the second week.  For lunch:  Mango Curry (flavorful, sweet and mildly spicy), Pad See-Eau (wide noodles with chicken, shrimp, and veggies), Beef Satay skewers (flavorful, but better to cut with a knife than eat from the skewer), and Thai Iced Tea.  A very good lunch!  For Carry  out:  Map Fried Rice (house recipe - it was tasty), and Lemongrass Chicken (also good).  When eating at a place like this with several people, it is always better to eat family style to enjoy more variety.  Good luck to the Map of Thailand ladies!  I'm looking forward to many more delicious meals in the years to come.  :)  See photos from our Lunch.  5/9/11 Update:  Since writing the initial review, I've enjoyed the Map of Thailand cuisine a few more times and every meal was outstanding so this restaurant continues to deserve 5 Stars for consistency.  We also went for Mother's Day and I think because it is still relatively new, there was not a crowd or long line like many other places on Mother's Day.  In addition to the Mango Curry, Pad See-Eau noodles, and Lemon Chicken recommendation above, I really enjoyed the Tamarind Duck - tasty if you like duck.  The beef or chicken Satay Skewers are good especially for kids."}
{"text":"Well thai me up and curry me away--what an awesome, sneaky little pic for great Thai food!   Don't get me wrong, I \"heart\" Banana Blossom and some of the other Thai places around Ohio City, but this place can't be beat for the price. Are you kidding me? $6-7 for an entree? Yes, please.   It's located in Cleveland's Asiatown district, but luckily the decor is modern and not so... well, scary. It's very clean, although, I could do without the carpet. Have I been watching too much Gordon Ramsey? Perhaps, but carpet in a restaurant is still kind of gross.   Anyways, they're hours are fantastic (open on Sundays) and we walked into a pretty slow dinning room. I ordered the hot and sour soup, the spring rolls and this spicy, basil chicken dish with brown rice. My beau ordered the chicken coconut soup, edamame and the country pad thai. He's can be a bit of a pain in the ass to please, but man, was he pleased. Me? I loved the soup and the spring rolls. They all tasted fresh, light and worth the price. My main course was very good, just not as spicy as I would have liked. But now I know to ask for more kick, because other than that, the taste was spot on.   The service was wonderful and fast. When you add that to tasty food for about half the price of other Thai restos around town, you have a winner. I would just suggest asking for more spice if you're a heat seeker. And let's face it, if you're looking for Thai food, you've got to be looking for heat.   (Oh, and you can't beat free parking and BYOB!!!)"}
{"text":"If I were blindfolded with one hand tied behind my back, I probably would have cooked better food. We went there on a Monday, so maybe the A team had the day off. But, damn it, at least leave the recipes for the C team. Too much fish sauce in every dish. Service was passable but too lazy to bring out another takeout box to replace the busted one he brought."}
{"text":"Got to say, walking into an empty restaurant draws red flags right away, but hey, since we were already there, might as well give it a try. Me and some co workers decided to go try some authentic Thai food, so after a ton of research we ended up here. Empty, so we got sat, and proceeded to get menus and order drinks. Its 10 F outside, so I wanted a soup, ordered the Tom Yung Kung (hot lemon grass soup), which was pretty good. The shrimp surprised me a little bit, but delicious nonetheless. Proceeded with our entrees, I got the Duck Panang Curry, which was delicious... best I've had yet. Spicy enough that your nose starts to run, but flavorful, which is difficult to find such combo.   Overall, I am very pleased with this place, their service was great. I'll be sure to check it out next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior, this little place is owned and run by Vicky who also makes the sauces for the dishes in the mornings. Everything was delicious and she also catered to our special diet request no problem. Very sweet owner, great customer service and good food. Support small business!"}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT! It's not the fanciest restaurant in the world. It is not the cheapest Asian food in the area. But it IS consistently wonderful and definitely not as expensive as some Thai food I've had. I am probably here once a week, and I've never been a regular at any restaurant before. Vicky, the owner/hostess/waitress (and like, the nicest lady ever) knows my usual when I walk in the door: som tum and the seafood coconut soup. How can something be the ultimate comfort food but still be healthy? I love love love it. Not many restaurants carry golden bags either - GET THE GOLDEN BAGS. I haven't yet eaten something here I wouldn't recommend. Map of Thailand rules."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in Cleveland. Here are the great items. Seafood coconut soup, green papaya salad, larb and country style pad Thai. Good items include the beef jerky & chicken satay. Great service and we will continue to frequent this place!"}
{"text":"Super reasonable prices for AMAZING Thai food!  We got appetizers to share & entree's and left for less than $12 each.  The Massaman Curry is packed with veggies, and they even let me add broccoli and snap peas for no additional price.  Count me in - please!   The dining room is small and doesn't offer much in terms of \"atmosphere\" - but the food does more than make up for it.  Enjoy some food there, and swing next door for some sweets from KoKo bakery. That is one heck of an evening right there!"}
{"text":"Great place, delicious food, friendly service! My favorite spot near downtown for Thai food. The Som Tom is so delicious! The curries are balanced and the noodles are cooked well."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my hubby the other day. Cute, clean space that filled as we were there... and LOTS more folks were getting takeout. Started with the fresh rolls... delicious with fresh basil and yummy peanut sauce, only wish they were slightly larger! Also split \"beef jerky\" with a sweet chili dipping sauce - DELICIOUS!!! Seriously, order this! For mains, hubby went with Pad Thai - Country Style and I had the Drunken Noodles. Pad Thai was very good, with a bit of spice. I was slightly underwhelmed by my Drunken Noodles, I asked for them to be extra spicy, but they came out quite bland. Still tasty, but needed an extra kick for sure. Total tab for lunch was $28, we felt it was worth it! Want to go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We got carryout recently and the first time in years.  We were one of the first customers to try this place when they opened.  I thought their food was exceptional back then.  My last visit, the Curry seafood was incredible.  The Golden Bags, not so much.  They were the size of quarters and appeared bone dry, no filling and tasteless.  I was a bit upset as for the price of 5.95 for 4, totally not worth it.  I highly recommend any of their curry dishes -the flavors are intense and complex.  Our last visit I'd asked for one of our dishes to add chinese broccoli which they did, then charged us an extra $2.  Yet there was barely any broccoli in the entree.  We don't mind being charged extra, but a restaurant should always make the additional charge known to the customer at the time of oder  Especially for a $2 surcharge.  Reading some of the other Yelp reviews I agree that the portion sizes have gotten much smaller.  Will we go back?  Not sure.  As we live in Lakewood, there are other Thai places close by and comparable.  Still if you are in the area definitely check out, but order plenty."}
{"text":"Nice small place with a parking lot and very fresh, visually appealing Thai food. Service is fast so as long as you can get a table you can easily do a weekday lunch at this little gem in Asia town."}
{"text":"The place is small and plain. The tom yum soup is average with very little seafood. The egg rolls are small but you get four however there is no spicy mustard for them. The main course was very good the Curry dish was outstanding. Full of flavor and the brown rice was cooked to perfection. Service is slow specially if you want to leave."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful, the food is packed with amazing seasons, everything is good, the mango mousse it's one of the best desserts I've ever tried."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant 3 times now and LOVE it.  It is clean, bright and open.  The service is great....and most importantly, the food is WONDERFUL.  I highly recommend the pineapple rice and the chicken satay.  We go on our lunch hour and we are in & out within 45 mins.  They have a great menu with a large selection and we look forward to trying everything."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I got the hot and sour soup. The broth was nice but it was not very spicy.  There were 2 shrimp and few mushroom pieces.  I got the drunken noodles which went pretty well with my mental state : )  It was very tasty but I asked for it to be very spicy.  It was not.  I seem to have this issue at most Asian places as they don't think my gringo ass can take the heat! The food was well flavored and not greasy.  Pretty good overall.  This would be a good place to come with a group so as to try a bunch of stuff.  Oh and they have a BYOB policy."}
{"text":"Not really relevant in the yelp world, but I've worked with them before when catering for an Asian Pacific American Heritage celebration for my office and they were very reasonable with pricing and portions. There were some minor hiccups in communication and paperwork, but the owner was friendly and a pleasure to do business with.  As for the restaurant itself. The decor is contemporary/minimal and very clean. The staff is friendly. The food is way up there in quality with some of the best pad thai I've tasted. I've had their drunken noodle and mango curry as well, and they were alright but I've never been a big fan of those dishes anyway. One thing to note is that their portions tend to be noticeably smaller than what other restaurants offer, so if you are used to feeling grossly full after eating Thai, you might want to look elsewhere. On the bright side, you'll have room for dessert or bubble tea next door. Their fried ice cream is amazing. I don't know what it is about their batter, but it was phenomenal. Presentation was nice too.  Misc... they don't serve alcohol, but they do allow BYOB, which is nice but kind of clashes with the somewhat classy vibe they attempt to establish. Also, you have to request chopsticks or you'll get silverware by default.  Overall, a nice addition to Cleveland's Asiatown."}
{"text":"Thai food!  Finally! A wonderful and welcome addition to Asiatown in Cleveland. Modestly wedged between an Asian barbershop and Koko bakery in a small plaza on East 36th and Payne lies Map of Thailand,  which has a charming, cafe-like feel. The menu has classic Thai dishes: edamame, coconut soup, pad thai, curry etc... and the staff is warm, efficient, and knowledgeable.                The food is well executed, with outstanding sauces and spices, beautiful presentations and perfect portions. All pricing is very reasonable. If you love Thai food, you must check out Map of Thailand.  Note: Parking, yes. Bar, no."}
{"text":"Great service and pretty good thai food.  I still prefer peppermint thai in pepper pike but this is close by option.  They are near several other authentic asian restaurants and they have attached parking.  I got the seafood soup, basil chicken and panang curry. I was not that big a fan of the seafood coconut soup though people seem to rave about it.  The basil chicken and panang had good flavor profiles but I ordered level 3 on the heat scale and should have got level 2 even though I enjoy spicy food, if you don't like spicy food definitely ask for level 1 and you still may need plenty of water and rice.  Peppermint Thai has a slightly higher price point but a nicer ambiance but is in a completely different part of town.  I think Map of Thailand is a good option if you live nearby.  Portions are average size.  Chicken dishes are about 11$ and include rice and soup was 4$.  The coconut and green tea ice creams were pretty flavorful and a nice way to end the meal but Mitchell's is still my preferred ice cream provider."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent, well priced lunch spot in mid-town.  Excellent personal service with servers who recall your preferences after only a few visits.  Straight forward Thai that is sumptuous and always very fresh with many choices to keep it interesting for multiple visits.  Perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love Map of Thailand!  I've been here a few times before and I never wrote a review.  I stopped in for lunch last week, and realized its too good not to write one.  I walked up to the counter to do a take out order, and the guy who helped me pointed out all the dishes that could be made with tofu instead of meat.  He was so nice and really patient while I asked questions.  I got the drunken noodles with tofu and the fresh rolls with tofu.  The drunken noodles were really different.  Tons of veggies and a good portion of noodles, in a slightly spicy brown sauce.  The vegetables were really fresh, the noodles tasted homemade, and the tofu was cooked perfectly.  I was slightly confused when I opened the to go box, because the noodles aren't what you would expect.  But they're absolutely delicious!  The fresh rolls were awesome, next time I might ask for some sriracha or something just to add some spice.  Fresh rolls are veggies and tofu with basil, rolled into those clear noodles and served with a side of a sweet brown sauce.  I loved both of the dishes I got, and they were a pretty good lunch portion.  Around 12 dollars for both dishes and a diet coke.  I will for sure be back for more."}
{"text":"This place had a rave review so I decided to try it. I may have a bias because I care from a workout and I was starving. I ordered the drunken noodles to go and ordered it medium spicy. When I got home I was so hungry and I opened up the container and I was a little disappointed at the amount. It was a small size and I knew that I was still going to be hungry. I ordered it medium and there was no spice to it at all. I had to put my own chili sauce on to make it a little spicy. It had good flavor but I would give it 5 Stars if I had a little more."}
{"text":"Who ever comes to this place will be disappointed. Try some other thai food restaurants in Cleveland. There are a lot very good ones, except Map of Thailand!"}
{"text":"Been here so may times and I can say this is pretty much the only spot I go for Thai food in Cleveland. Their food is very delicious, delight, and consistent in terms of quality. There customer service is excellent. The owner is very open to opinions so feel free to let them know what you think about the food. They are willing to exchange/ fix my food if it doesn't fit my taste. This attitude is a must in owning a restaurant I believe. They will continue getting better as long as they're not afraid of admitting their weakness and improve from there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while.  I am a huge fan of Thai food and Map of Thailand does not disappoint.  The dining room is small: 10 - 15 tables, and tastefully decorated.  Staff is super friendly and and helpful.  We asked about gluten free options and almost everything on the menu is available in a gluten free version.  Service is friendly and attentive.  They don't have a liquor license, so it's byob.  But the food is very good.  We had Seafood Coconut Soup, Salmon Choo Chee, and Thai Style Basil.  The soup could have used a few more pieces of seafood, but it was very fragrant and the flavor was very good.  The salmon was also delicious.  The salmon was ever so slightly over cooked, but the sauce was just as good as my favorite Thai place.  The Thai Style Basil was also very fragrant with just the right amount of spice.  This is a great place for date night or to meet friends for dinner.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the place I go to if I have a Pad See-Eau craving. I have yet to find a place that does this dish better. I've had some other dishes such as their Massaman curry but this noodle dish is what I go back to time and time again, whether I'm dining in or getting it to-go.   The noodles are flat and thick, mixed with your choice of meat or tofu (chicken for me), eggs, broccoli, chinese broccoli (it has a name...I just don't know it), carrots and peanuts in a flavorful yet sweet sauce. It's lovely. You can order exra noodles for those who like their noodles because they do add a lot of meat, so it balances out. There's an extra charge but it's no more than a dollar or so. For dinner this dish is normally under $11 and for lunch it's under $9 and there's plenty of it. You can't beat that.   The décor is very nice and though the place isn't large, they've utilized it well and fit in a good number of tables without it feeling crowded. The service, both dining in and to go, is very pleasant and attentive.     I recommend trying this place out if you have a craving for Thai, or if you've never had Thai food. If you're confused what to order, I recommend Pad See-Eau but you, I'm a bit biased."}
{"text":"Not really sure why this place has such good reviews. I ordered take-out from them last night because of my craving for thai food all week, and decided to give them a try.   I got the red curry with tofu and veggies, pad thai country style, and basil chicken. 2 boxes of jasmine rice came with the orders.   If I had to rate the dishes from best to worst, they'd be in that order. The rice was on the mushy side...so that wasnt' what I wanted, of course. These dishes were definitely not spicy at all. Pretty mild to me.   The pad thai noodles didn't seem all that fresh and they didn't even serve it with a lime. Luckily I had my own limes at home to help make it taste better. What's pad thai without a squeeze of lime juice??? Tasted terrible without it.   The basil chicken was unimpressive flavor wise...I've just definitely had better.   I had high hopes for the restaurant because it's decently priced and I know it just opened last year, and many have given it good reviews. Disappointment...  I don't think I'll be going back. I think Ty Fun in Tremont is still the best I've found."}
{"text":"Golden Bags were delicious.  Yellow Curry and Country Pad Thai were both excellent.  The flavors here are rich and complex and our meals were spot on. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile and since I went to Tink Holl at lunch I figured why not. I pulled in and was surprised at how nice the decor was. Seemed rather upscale but not snooty. Still I felt out of place in jeans. I was greeted on walk in and ordered the red tofu curry to go.  I don't think I waited more than 5 minutes. Was very cold out  (23 degrees) and I have quite the walk up to my office but the food remained nice and hot!! I had never ordered curry before and was very very pleased!! To be fair I had only seen curry dishes on TV so seeing it as soupy as it was surprised me, but, as a poster started, its supposed to be that way.  Being in such close proximity to the Asian market I was certain it would be of the utmost freshness and was right.  The vegetables and mushrooms were fresh and full of flavor. The sauce was delightful. I will return!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast take out, and a very friendly staff.  The country-style Pad Thai is perfectly spiced and my favorite.  I have a couple vegetarian friends who swear that each and every dish is wonderfully adapted to their needs."}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was pretty good! The food was fast and hot. It was not my favorite Thai food ever but it was good particularly the golden purses.The pad thai and the curry we had were a bit on the sweet side. Also this place was completely dead! Granted it was a Monday night but my sister and I were only one of three other tables there the whole night. But I would definitely come back to it if I were in the area again. That being said I am not sure why I would be in that area again. I agree with the previous reviews that it is in a sketchier part of town but the restaurant has its own well lit parking lot and it felt very safe."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. Beef Jerky Appetizer and Pad Thai for lunch. The best lunch experience I have had in quite a long time. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"I went to Map of Thailand last weekend with a group of friends. They do not serve alcohol but allow you to bring whatever with no corking fee which was nice.  I got tom yum and had the opportunity to try the tom Kha as well. Both were solid soups.  I ordered the drunken noodle which I enjoyed. My only disappointment was that I would have liked it spicier. Obviously I could / should have asked for it to be spicy but it was labeled on the menu as spicy and it is always difficult to gauge what that is going to mean at different Thai restaurants. Sometimes spicy is American spicy and sometimes it is Thai spicy, which in my experience are two very different things.  All in all it was a nice experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"My SO lived in Bangkok, Thailand for 10 years. He still visits friends and family there once a year. I defer to him as the authority of Thai cuisine.  We went here for the 1st time. He considers Map of Thailand the closest to being authentic in CLE, pending future updates.  Here's what we had: (see my photos)  1. Golden bags: it looks like fried wonton, but wonton skin is made of flour. This is made of tofu skin. Tofu skin carries the mild fragrance of soy. Flavor of the filling is pretty close to spring roll. I can taste the shiitake mushroom. I think it's overall crispy and fragrant. My Thai authority didn't think much of it.  2. Thai lemon ice tea: Thai authority ordered. Usually other restaurants offer Thai ice (milk) tea. This is rare to find. I thought the black tea is very fragrant. Thai authority thinks it's a bit sweeter than authentic ones, but not bad.  3. Kao soi noodle soup: Thai authority ordered this, since it's rare to find in CLE. Strong curry flavor in the noodle soup with some crispy noodles on top, providing texture. Again, skewed sweet, but pretty good. I'd consider ordering this next time.  4. Masaman curry w/ seafood: shrimps were fresh, salmon so so. Overall Good flavor. I was comparing the curry to Peppermints's. I thought MOT's curry is lighter, more liquidy.  I then soon got corrected that in Thailand, the curry dishes should come out a bit soupy, unlike the American versions here tend to be dense and heavy. I think it's because the stereotypical impression is that curry should be like the Indian curry, which is often presented in a dense consistency.   5. Lard nad: this is my benchmark dish when comparing restaurants. It's good, will order again. Again I thought Peppermint's has a stronger flavor. Truthfully I like the stronger version better. I think they use more shrimp paste to achieve the strong flavor.  But what do I know, I just attempt to cook Thai food with his cousins and listened to lectures about how the authentic versions should be. I didn't grow up eating from street vendors all over Bangkok.  6. Roti pancake: jackpot! I'm often amazed at how wonderful food come out of simple ingredients. I normally would bypass pancake on menu at any restaurant. But boy was I glad I had Thai authority to pick the real gem out of the bunch!   They called it \"roti\" (when he was conversing with the staff to confirm the dish); I was actually thinking it could be roti saimai, another sugary unhealthy but amazing street dessert.   The texture reminds me of roti canai (served at pacific east Coventry). Layers of sweet crispiness. To really think about the ingredients, it's only dough, fat, and condense milk. Most Thai vendors add their own twists, e.g. Banana, so MOT is the plain Jane version. But 24 hours later I'm still thinking about it. Fellow foodies, make sure to try it next time.  This is only the beginning. We will come back to evaluate other dishes"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. I recently moved to Cleveland and tried this place with a colleague. We had the Golden bags, seafood coconut curry soup, drunken noodles and green curry chicken. All the dishes tasted fresh and were well prepared. Price was reasonable and the service was excellent. Can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Always delicious! Since the the first week they opened their doors. I have introduced so many folks, and they all now claim the MAP as one of their favorite restaurants, never a disappointment!!! Salmon Choo Chee - Delicious Country Pad Thai - Outstanding Basil Fried Rice - By Far The BEST in CLEVELAND Mango Fried Rice - Perfect every time Pineapple Fried Rice - Wonderful flavors Mango Sticky Rice - The Best in Cleveland All the appetizers - Fantastic All the Beverages - especially the Jasmine Lime Ice Tea - Brilliant Salads - Out of this world tastes!!!  ......................................................................Mic Drop"}
{"text":"I'm in a middle on this one. On one side,  The food was decently priced, the place was clean, and the service was great. BYOB! On the other side, the food was a bit disappointing. We ordered several items and requested for \"very spicy\" and it was not spicy whatsoever. And I'm Thai !! My friend who was not Thai agreed with me. It made me wonder what's \"mild\" taste like. Would there be distinguishable difference? Maybe we went on a bad day but it seems some other reviews also said the same thing.  In term of flavor (even with non-spicy items), the food tend to lean more toward the sweeter side. However, this is typical for many Thai restaurants that are more Americanized so no surprise there. I just hope in the future they decide to cater people who enjoy lighting their mouth on fire or breathing like a dragon. I guess the search for best Thai food in Cleveland area continues.."}
{"text":"Try the sticky rice and ice cream sundea!! Omg!  Thai iced coffee is yummy.  Great atmosphere, and food.  Would come here everyday if i could!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. My only issue was that I asked for my food extremely spicy and it didn't come out spicy. Still it was very tasty."}
{"text":"We went here on New Year Eve's Eve. The restaurant is clean and service was quick. We started with the Fresh Rolls and the Golden Bags. Both were tasty, particularly with the sauces.  For our main courses, we ordered the Ginger Chicken and the Country Pad Thai.  Both were fantastic. My only criticism was that the Pad Thai was described as spicy, but it was extremely mild. All in all, a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Their food is just OK the service is average the staff would treat people differently if you have four or more people they will add gratuity this used to be a good place not anymore if you Ask them to subtract or add anything to your food which  i was happy to pay for they will make faces and told us you guys are giving hard time which never used to be the case the owner needs to understand customers always right and value them"}
{"text":"The red curry was mildly sweet, I was expecting to be really spicy compared to other Thai restaurants I encountered and coming from a Thai background. But I enjoyed the sweetness of the curry. The chicken appetizer were good, and fulfilling. Only 3 pieces."}
{"text":"We each had the Pad Thai, mine without shrimp as I am allergic. We wanted it medium spicy. The waitress was nice enough to offer one and a half stars spicy, and it was the PERFECT amount of heat! Their Pad Thai was amazing!! We also ordered the spring rolls which were good. The price was right, the service was FAST (we had out food within 15 minutes of ordering on a Friday, during lunch time and the restaurant was half full) and the food was amazing! I will be going there again and taking more friends! :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Cleveland. Spent time speaking with one of the owners. All the food served is authentic as it gets w/ recipes being used from her Grandma. Each time I have gone, I have gotten something different. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Map of Thailand is the new Mint Cafe.    Mint Cafe used to be my favorite thai restaurant in the Cleveland metropolitan area.  I carried out from there basically every week.  It had pad thai that was very authentic (unlike Ty Fun), not mushy (unlike High Thai'd), had a good, full flavor (unlike Banana Blossom), yet was not overwhelmingly sweet (unlike Bangkok Thai).  It had duck that wasn't overwhelmed with ginger, and it also had a unique signature appetizer, the Golden Bags, composed of deep fried pouches containing delicious little morsels of meat.  Then, a year and a half ago, they abruptly closed.  Now a year and a half later, I walk into Map of Thailand and was surprised to find the same waitresses from Mint Cafe, the same owner, Vicki, and the same, wonderful food, as well as their signature Golden Bags.  I love Thai food and I've tried at least a Pad Thai at basically every Thai place you can name in the Cleveland area, and this ranks among the best.    It's definitely worth checking out.  I also recommend Peppermint in Pepper Pike (Mint Cafe's sister restaurant) and Charm Thai in Parma."}
{"text":"Very good, well priced thai food! Most entrees between $7-$8. Would recommend the khao soi noodle, it was just the right about of spicy and very creamy."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Cleveland and hadn't found any good Thai. This evening I took a walk to Map of Thailand and loved it. The service was courteous and prompt the fresh rolls were wonderful but the Pad Thai was out of this world. Great spot to get a bite"}
{"text":"Food: I stopped in for a quick and casual lunch and ordered the Map string beans with brown rice. I liked the level of richness and nuttiness in the sauce, which was just saucy enough to mix with rice. The spicy heat was mild (as I requested) which was flavorful with a little kick. Complex Thai flavors came through for sure.   Service/atmosphere: It was a cloudy cool day, but the place filled to capacity around 1230p. There's room for between 30-40 people. Staff was patient with explaining orders and options and was very open to personal modifications, adjusting for spice and contents of the veggies, etc. in the dish. We lost track of time and lingered a little, but they didn't rush us a bit, even though it was getting busy. Also appreciated the clean and quiet environment."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for lunch - mostly take out. Being a vegetarian, they cater to my needs (no fish/oyster sauce). Great customer service and they are quick! I love their curries and basil fried rice (which sometimes tends to more oily than desired). Overall, a popular spot in the area with a lot of loyal customers."}
{"text":"I normally wait a few days to review a place after I eat at it.  A little distance between me and the place itself always does some good for the objectivity of the review.  I can't hold back on this place, though.  First, it's immaculate inside.  We're talking Maserati-dealership levels of cleanliness in the dining room.  It's well-lit with natural light in the daytime.  While atmosphere doesn't do all that much for the quality of the meal for me, this place deserves to be noticed for that alone.    I had the duck noodle soup.  I eat pho like it's my job, so I wanted to try something similar, yet still different.  They brought me a good-sized bowl, with great hunks of tender duck meat.  It wasn't as hot as I expected, so I asked for some hot sauce;  this is where Map really started to earn its five stars.    I expected a bottle of Sriracha or something similar.  What I got was a small spoon of reddish powder, about the color of paprika, with some red pepper flakes mixed in. I wet my finger and took a taste off the edge.  I've had Szechuan peppercorn once or twice a while ago, but one doesn't quickly forget the numbing sensation that comes with the spicy flavor.  That's what I got.  Needless to say, that whole spoon ended up in the soup.  The bill came;  it was next to nothing.  For the way the restaurant is set up and the quality of the food, it felt like it should have cost much more.  I guess that's the beauty of Asiatown.  I'm sitting here, full and happy, with my wallet only a little lighter.    I sincerely hope that the next time I go to this place, there's a line out the door."}
{"text":"The basil fried rice is delicious. And the restaurant is more than happy to customize anything for you. A really wonderful place!"}
{"text":"The reviews on here for this place don't make any sense in regard to my experience.  I love Thai food, and have been to some fantastic restaurants serving authentic Thai dishes prepared by people from Thailand.  This was not one of those places.  I had the green curry and it smelled like a wet dog.  The taste wasn't much better.  After forcing myself to eat about half of the food, I couldn't take it much longer and ran out of the restaurant looking for a bush to vomit in."}
{"text":"Had the Wednesday night blues...decided to get some Thai food! Map of Thailand is a discreet nook of savory goodness. My party of two was the only dine-in table for nearly 2 hours, but that didn't stop the staff from serving up some 5 star service.   We started off with the Golden Bags-- an ingenious little luggage package of chicken, shrimp and shrooms. Delicious and cute to boot! The seafood coconut soup was next and it was scrum-diddly-umptious! I'm a huge fan of anything with a coconut base and this definitely hit the spot. It was creamy, flavorful, and just the perfect mix of sweet and salty! For my entree I had the drunken noodle--which was rich and perfectly balanced. I hate noodle dishes that overload the noodles and skimp on the veggies and meat, but this was done right. The noodles weren't too oily and the stir fry sauce was flavorful without being overpowering. My beau ordered the Khao Soi Noodle, and I'm not ashamed to say that I instantaneously claimed it as my own. The red curry sauce was SO addictingly spicy and powerful! Now I'm not one to sign up for a spicy meal, but this dish packed such a delicious flavor profile behind the spiciness, I just couldn't stop eating it....it had DEPTH. And the crispy egg noodles on top were just the perfect palate cleanser to balance the spice. (Although I'll admit I did need something sweet to cut the spice half way through devouring my beau's dinner, so I ordered the Thai ice tea...which is basically just Lipton and sugar, but it was YUM).   I finished the night off with some deep fried ice cream and sipped some wine brought from home, while contemplating if the waitress had noticed that I'd eaten more than half the order! Overall, I'd call this one a success.   *Tip: BYOB :)"}
{"text":"Last week, we were making our monthly trip to the bakery next door & we're hungry for lunch. We decided to try Map of Thailand based on the reviews here & the rumbles of our bellies. We tried the spring rolls which were wonderful. We also both had the Pad Thai which I think I could eat daily. It was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. I was so happy that I couldn't finish it and was able to have it for lunch again the next day. The staff was very friendly and all the tables around us seemed very pleased with their food. This will be a regular stop from now on!"}
{"text":"This is a very good Thai restaurant. We ordered money bag and Spring roll as appetizer. The Spring Roll is really good. It's a change to have vegetarian spring roll and the money bag was so good. The entree we ordered Country Style Pad Thai, mango curry and Thai basil chicken. All the entrees was very good. The Pad Thai could use a lime wedge and crushed peanuts to the combination. The Thai Basil chicken is amazingly good. You can really taste the chicken and the basil. We ordered the Thai Iced Tea and Thai Coffee. The flavor of beverage is really good. It comes with the cute rose petal made from the straw covers. Each dish is very well garnished and presented.  The waitress is very friendly and gave us a great service. Definitely will go back again to try other item on the menu."}
{"text":"It is always a thrill to find a Thai restaurant that exceeds my expectations. After 25 years traveling all over the US, and especially to the West Coast, I developed a real passion for finding great Thai food.  Make time for Map of Thailand. The decor is nothing special. The real joy of this restaurant happens on the other side of the kitchen door, where humble ingredients are transformed into something extraordinary.  The Drunken Noodles dish shimmers with just the right amount of heat and never strays into excess, while the Pad Thai will satisfy the hungry but less adventurous amongst us.  Ready to dive deeper? Khoa Soi Noodle is a complex and sturdy dish that begs to be shared.   Duck Noodle soup? Yes, please.  I wish I lived closer so I could make this my daily lunch destination."}
{"text":"Thai food lovers out there try this it will not disappoint you. Love the country style pad Thai. It's the best pad Thai I have eaten lo far."}
{"text":"Very good food I must say , but it's always slow every time i come , or maybe it's just the in between lunch and dinner hours that I come . I would usually come here with my cousins and we would always order : Chicken Sauté, Thai Style Papaya Salad, Beef Jerky, and a side of soup (depends what I'm in the mood for that day ) for appetizers . Our main course to share : Country Style Pad Thai, Basil Fried Rice, Penang Curry, Or sometimes I would order the Duck Soup . The setting of the restaurant is nice for a small place . They have purple table cloths that makes it very fancy and wine glass for water. Service is not always great , just depends when the waitress feels like being nice or whatever , even on slow days. When she does come and check up on us, she doesn't really speak up so we would always say it's ok and we would always ask for water to be filled. I find it kinda weird for a waitress to wear sandals in the summer and boots in the winter , and not a regular pair of tennis shoes or shoes that would be appropriate for a server to wear . I guess it's a small family own restaurant or something that doesn't really care much about that , but that's just me, I like to pay attention to a lot of things and that's why I enjoy being a helper I guess !"}
{"text":"Super solid lunch spot and they'll make anything vegan if they can. Very polite staff. A little pricey for the portions but totally worth it. Eating inside is nice too but I usually get take out. This place is popular for a reason and gets crazy busy on Fridays so if you don't have a lot of time for lunch go earlier in the week. Not super hot so ask for extra \"red spice\" on the side to self season if you like it hot. My husband is obsessed with their fresh made jerky, I stick to basil fried rice or Thai curry. Summer rolls, tofu triangles, and salads are all great just small portions. If their phone is busy call back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We met our double date partners at Map of Thailand, for a quick dinner and to try out the restaurant, as none of us had been there before.  Right next to Koko Bakery, Map of Thailand sits in a spot that used to occupy a Taiwanese restaurant. Map came out sometime this past year, and I've been meaning to try out.  It's a clean, nicely presented restaurant. We were seated right away (wasn't too busy on a Sunday night), and decided to order family style to try the most that we could. We ordered: - Basil Fried Rice: average, nothing spectacular - Khao Soi Noodle: I thought curry dish had great flavor, but not really spicy - Pik King Land: Okay, average - Chili Duck: Definitely my favorite. Great flavor, and the duck was cooked really well.   So overall, I felt like the dishes were cooked well, but it wasn't spicy. At All. And when I think of Thai food, I think spice! So..... I have no idea why it wasn't spicy (thus, my 3 star review), but the food was good? If you can't handle spice, I guess that's good for you, but when I think Thai food...I want my spicy Thai food...."}
{"text":"The food was decent, not bad.. not really good either. It really wasn't satisfied my taste buds. I asked the owner if the food was americanized to fit people in the area taste buds; She said yes.   Might be good for people for the area but not for me."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference visiting Cleveland. Had a night to myself and found this place on Yelp. Once again, fellow Yelpers did not disappoint.   I am glad I decided to drive instead of walking as the neighborhood this place was in was a little sketchy. The parking lot and strip mall it's in is very nice, though. The interior of the restaurant is nicely done and welcoming.  I started with the house salad and what was brought was colorful medley of flavor (see picture). I've never had a house salad quite so good. The peanut dressing was slightly warm, and good enough to drink by the gallon. I followed that up with the fresh rolls, which were delicious.  I couldn't decide between the two basil chicken dishes they had. The waitress suggested one of them (with minced chicken). I got it spicy, which I like. She was spot on. It was the perfect amount of spice and delectable flavor.  Lastly, I finished my meal off with some fried ice cream. I've always thought of Mexican restaurants when it comes to fried ice cream, but they did it right!  I would definitely return if I find myself back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Cleveland! Before they opened I would have to drive all the way to Avon for really good Thai food (seriously Cleveland, what's up with the lack of Thai places?), but now it's only 10 minutes away! I love their satay and beef salad. The waitresses are super nice and remembers me after only going there twice. This is my go to restaurant when I'm craving curry!"}
{"text":"I woke up with a sore throat this morning. I was mad about it all day. I knew that I wanted some Thai curry for dinner. A friend has been talking about how good this place is for lunch. I took my friend to Stonewall for his first time and we decided on Map of Thailand for dinner. I had the Green Curry, Tom Yum Kung soup, fresh rolls and spring rolls. The curry was delicious, the soup was decent and the rolls were great. My friend ordered the Khao Soi Noodle dish and enjoyed it. The meal helped to clear out my sinuses. This was a great little restaurant. I really hope that it does well. The interior is very cozy and open. Instead of going to your mainstay for Thai, try this place out next time you are craving Thai. Plus Koko Bakery is directly next door for a sweet desert. Sounds like a perfect night out to me. It was actually a remarkable day. Boring, terrible day at work, shooting range, eating curry, eating dessert and then calling it a day. If only I could relive this. Except for the part when my friend told me he had a zit or something on the inside of his eye. When he showed it to me, it began oozing."}
{"text":"This is my #1 favorite Thai restaurant outside of Thailand. The Khao Soi is heavenly as is the masaman curry, friend rice and pad see ew. Great and quick service. I usually get a meal there and get one to go since it is out of the way for me."}
{"text":"Nice little place for lunch.  Portions are a little small, but I like that cuz I have a habit of eating my entire plate and going back to work ready for a nap.  Food is pretty good though and the place seems pretty clean. I come here often when i feel like i need a lighter, healthier option to a burger and fries.  Try it!"}
{"text":"We eat Thai food in this house all the time. We have one favorite place and are also super picky when trying new Thai places.  I don't think we let our guard down seeing as we just completed a 7 hour drive, but I found Map of Thailand's food very good and well-prepared.   We ordered Take-out, and when we arrived I felt sorely under-dressed even though my T shirt and track pants were clean. (I told you we just drove 7 hours, right?). The space is simple yet the decor casual-chic accented with deep purples. Perfect spot for date nights.   We ordered a ton of food and there was not one bad dish in the bunch. The spice was just right and didn't overpower the flavor. Nothing seemed heavy and the fried rice was not greasy either. The noodles were cooked perfectly and there was a lot of seafood/chicken in the dishes. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken and beef satay. Not too flavorful and the chicken had a sour kind of flavor to it. Otherwise everything else was just delicious...  Basil Fried Rice, Map Fried Rice, Drunken Noodles (my favorite of the night!), Thai Style Basil (a wee bit too salty for my taste), Andaman Princess (my second fave of the night, so full of yummy seafood).   Service was nice, a bit harried, but not unfriendly. A def neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Cleveland. Been here once and have been dying to go back. I got a beef salad and a delicious noodle dish (I don't remember the name of it)."}
{"text":"The food here is average. I came here on a weekday afternoon and it was empty inside. I noticed that my water had a black speck in it, but decided not to say anything. The golden bags appetizer is flavorful, crunchy and pairs well with the sauce it comes with. However, the portion is small for the price. The pad see eau is decent, but I got tired of eating it after a few bites. There was nothing about the dish that stood out.   As for the service, I have no complaints. The food cane out in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress did come to check up on us. Still, there are better Thai restaurants in town and I probably won't be returning to this one anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is good! I didn't even know it existed, but a friend suggested it for a lunch meeting during the work day. It was clean and the staff was attentive. I had green curry, and it was really good - perfect spice level. All in all, it was typical green thai curry. Nothing amazing, but solid.   The portion was really small though. I wasn't complaining because I hate leftovers... especially that I would need to take back to work with me. But, the portion was honestly much smaller than most restaurants. Still yummy."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food.  I had Lard (quite spicy) and my partner had the Tom Yon soup for starters.  I had Panaang Curry (very nice sauce) and he had some spicy basil dish.  Portion size was good -- enough but not too much.  Service was reasonably quick.  The restaurant is very clean and sparse but pleasant.  Prices were great -- much better than the place in Ohio City."}
