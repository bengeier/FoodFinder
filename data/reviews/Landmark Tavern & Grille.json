{"text":"We decided to try the Landmark Tavern & Grille last night.  Full disclosure, I play in a band that played at Landmark recently and it was comments by the owner, Dennis Blakeslee that caused my wife and I to give it a try.  Dennis seemed really passionate about the food he creates and based on our meals last night, it really comes through.  

We started out trying a cup of seafood chowder, which I think had clams, shrimp & a couple of varieties of white fish in it and.....it was AWESOME!  I could have had a vat of chowder and called it a night.  Some chowders can be pasty, but not this stuff, it was extremely flavorful and fairly light.    

The fish-fry was pollock, and it had been treated with a flour, egg wash & panko crust that was out of this world.  Most fish fry's are battered and fried, which is good/great, but Landmark's style of preparation is more involved and results in something you rarely see in a local bar/restaurant.  I had cole slaw, also very good and obviously home made, and onion rings which were as good as it gets, also made in house.  (yes, I needed something else fried, to go with my fried fish)

My wife had a Cajun-grilled pollock that was also outstanding.  It's a nice alternative if you're trying to cut down on the fried foods factor.  The drinks were good, the service was excellent and everyone was very friendly.  Our tab, which included 4 martini's and 2 beers came to $75, which we thought was very reasonable, given the amount of booze we (mostly me) consumed.

We highly recommend Landmark Tavern and Grille if you want a low key evening, in a locally owned and operated restaurant/bar that is driven by a guy who is serious about the food he serves.  Great job Dennis, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"LandMark Tavern & Grille is one of the best restaurants in all of Cleveland. Last time I was there I had the AYCE Crab Legs. These aren't your typical snow crab that you find at most places. These were high quality, lots of meat, cooked to perfection crab legs! The Rib-eye Nachos were amazing. And my nephew said his burger was the best he's ever had! Dennis Blakeslee is a Master in the kitchen!"}
