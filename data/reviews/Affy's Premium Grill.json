{"text":"Excellent food. Ended up treating a few friends there last month.  They were all super impressed with menu and loved the food. I have to say great recipes and amazing spread of steaks, fish, chicken and kids meal deals. Keep it up Affy's ..my wallet hated you though :)"}
{"text":"Ordered medium rare, got medium well... and that was after the hour long service to receive our order. Service could be a lot better, the steak was average."}
{"text":"Wouldn't visit during Ramadan or on busy holidays--my last two trips here weren't all that great. The wait times (for both food and seating) were very long and the food itself was on the mediocre side. My steak was nowhere near as tasty as usual. I wouldn't recommend the pasta or tiramisu."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic,  good portion size, friendly staff, nice and clean, good looking restaurant from inside. Outside is a bit dark and ominous.  Would recommend the place. Oh and they add 18% tip on our bill automatically.  Not a fan of that."}
{"text":"One of the better grilled beef steak eaten in a long time, fresh and juicy. Friendly people with formal environment. Family owned. Drove an hour from Toronto for these ... but at the end of the day, its all worth it. Highly recommended, make sure to make a reservation before you go!"}
{"text":"went here after years again... and still disappointed ... we went for lunch ...ordered a chciken sandwich with ceaser salad , ribs and a kids grilled chciken meal.   there was 1 server , and only half of thr restaurant was being used ..so we sat ... 5-7 minutes later the host realizes he didn't give us the menu .. tosses the menu on the table ... fair enough OK! :/  ordered our food .. took 25 minutes ...  got the ceaser salad first ... liek literally 2 croutons on it ..few strips of the lettuce lol ... JOKE  the chciken burger ... blah... the chciken was dried ..and tasted like old refrigerated chucken that has been left in thr fridge for a week or 2 ... it was the same with the kids menu ..the chciken was dry ..super dry . they missed giving the drink with the kids menu ..lol  the ribs ... was ok... I found it too salty ... my partner found it ok... .. Def not worth the price ...  I wish it went back to when it first opened ...at that time the food was exxxelllent .  I hope they can improve ... I might try them several more years later.   but on the other hand ... at least we ate ... $50 later lol"}
{"text":"Affy's Premium Grill is pretty much the best non ethnic Halal joint in the GTA. Of course, in the context of the GTA, where pretty much every Halal place is ethnic, a traditional western style steak place like Affy's would count as 'ethnic'!  Pickering is a ways off from where I live, so my wife and I make our trek to Affy's a big adventure, which we treat ourselves to every couple of months.  I've tried a number of their main dishes, from the Filet Mignon, to the Chicken Pasta Primavera, to the ribs. And all the fare I have tried is superb.  The Filet Mignon is just heavenly - tender and juicy. The ribs are great as far as ribs go, though to be honest, I am not a fan of ribs anyway. I'd rather just have the steak! The Chicken Primavera is also great - the spinach flavour really stands out.  Affy's is also a great family environment (perhaps a little too much so?), and you will see lots of folks with kids tagging along, enjoying a nice night out.  To summarize, Affy's is by far the best non-ethnic Halal restaurant in the city, and I highly recommend people to make the trip, even though the Pickering location might deter them."}
{"text":"The food was amazing especially steak and fish. Wonderful place for official dinners."}
{"text":"Its one of my favorite spot for dinner, since we only eat halal food its hard to find good authentic halal restaurant. The food is amazing, the fish finger and calamari as an appetizer to drool over. The steaks are done however you like it, the best one is the rib eye steak. Only problem is that they are under staff some times, which makes it annoying because you have to wait for service. Overall one of my fav place.   PS: Pina Colada's are the best."}
{"text":"Customer service is good, not on par with competitors though. Food is good but portions are small, when I say small I mean for the price someone is paying. Quesadilla quality was not good at all the last time I came. Everything else is good!"}
{"text":"It was arrite. not a pro at making steak but chicken was pretty goood.  not worth the scar-pickering trip tho"}
{"text":"This place is good the.. Got the Cajun and lemon chicken entree with the husband to share... The food did take some time to come but the wait was well worth it... The chicken was cooked well.. Both the dishes could have used a little more sauce but other than that it was good... We got the grilled veges and salad for our sides.  . The veges were very well seasoned but the salad was all lettuce.... Would come back here"}
{"text":"I don't think they maintain a consistent standard and the wait time is horrible despite reserving seats sometimes my family still waits a good half an hour.... The waiters look sluggish and tired except one Italian waiter he always makes sure we are satisfied with the service and food... The steak and pasta dish seems always dry the pasta texture is not al-dente very mushy hit and miss every time I order that dish....seriously I think us Muslim folks don't have much choice to enjoy a good steak dinner either we come here or go to karamia so we settle with any quality of food!!! We don't get true culinary experience we settle for what is put in front of us which tastes nothing how a good pasta or steak Dinner should taste like!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty much standard, steaks are ok nothing to special in taste. Poor and slow service, cold food, overpriced, didn't enjoy going there."}
{"text":"We went to Affys for dinner . Great meal very tasty . Really good service even though they were very busy .  We will go back for sure . Really nice restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Food here is a hit or miss.  Used to be great but service definitely lacks.  We never really get their steaks.  I always used to get the Cajun stuffed chicken breast but the flavor and quality is not consistent.  The halal no steak pasta is good but the last time,  I ordered it for takeout I was hugely disappointed.  They literally gave is boiled pasta with a water sauce and Lil pieces of steak here and there.  I know ppl go here due to the halal steak tag attached to it.  Other than that,  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Oh man, my food has been delicious each time I've been. I've ordered penne pasta with steak, a dip with pita, chicken quesadilla, stuffed chicken breast, and a few other items. I personally enjoyed each item I've had, with my favourite being the stuffed chicken by far. Give it a try! I would give it 4.5 stars if possible though because the service is on the slow side."}
{"text":"I was here the day it opened and have been coming monthly since my kids and wife love the food more than any other establishment in the city. I personally find it MEH and cant stand the service. The argument is 'I cant get a Halal steak anywhere in the city' so we come to Affys.  Stickey tables, smelly washrooms and sub par service, no thanks."}
{"text":"I have heard of the location in Pickering and most recently the one in Mississauga. I have not eaten at either of them but decided to give it a shot.   On Dec 16, we had a company lunch at the Mississauga location. Waiters are friendly, but we waited 1.5 - 2  hours for our food and drinks. Unacceptable. We were a total of 18 people and I felt like an idiot for recommending this place. I ordered the rack of ribs and it was okay at best. The calamari however for starters was good. Others complained their steak was overcooked.   Fast forward to Dec 29.  The family wanted to go out and eat and i thought I'd bring them here to try the food. BIG MISTAKE... You can tell the quality of the food is not there. The wife ordered chicken breast and it was hard on the edges. Like rock hard. Was the chicken old? Just a nasty site...  I ordered the 12oz rib eye and it was overcooked. I sent it back and this around it was rare despite me ordering a medium well steak. I sent it back and refused for them to correct it. I had lost my appetite by now. The steak seemed to be oil infused. It literally tasted like oil. You can also tell the cut was not AAA. I know my steaks and have ordered from AAAHalalSteaks.com before, ate at Black Ox and Crave Grill.  This was definitely not on par with any of the above places.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND GO TO AFFY'S. Disgusting food to be honest.  Want a great halal steak?  1. Www.blackoxbistro.com ( I only eat steaks here) 2. Www.cravegrillhouse.com ( all their food is good)  Bbq'ing at home but you need AAA grade steaks? Check out  Www.aaahalalsteaks.com   Faheem"}
{"text":"Steaks are good but i feel they can make the place look a little more professional. Sometimes they are so busy that they cannot even keep up with the orders and waits can exceed 25-30 minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible experience....food was undercooked and restraunt did not have any heating. Most items are overpriced. Guys dont waste your money...its not worth it."}
{"text":"-Very dark and not well maintained. Also very dirty around the restaurant. -was not happy with the food as I ordered steak and was not cooked properly. -service was ok but a little slow.  I was pretty disappointed as I heard many good things about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. For a halal place, the 'Italian'  is amazing. The wait times are horrendous and the ambience isn't great. The customers make you feel like you're in Saudi Arabia or something something- which takes away from ambience. Nonetheless, if you're willing to put up with really long wait times and inattentive staff, then I would recommended checking the food out, it's quite good!"}
{"text":"It took 40 mins before I could get my server, Brittany to take our order. I kept asking other staff to take the order but they refused. They also didn't have many of the items on the kids menu saying they had run out.  Overall poor service and terrible food taste. They are over priced for the quality taste and service.  I'm never ever going back there again."}
{"text":"My first experience n here is what i feel...looong waiting time to be seated,lazy service especially for a weekend,reached at 9pm n got served by 10:15pm....ordered two types of grilled chicken...pasta and steak.....chicken, too hard and drenched in sauces...tasteless bed of rice n veggies...pasta ws nothing wow either....poor presentation...extremely disappointing food..."}
{"text":"I had calamari ribs with fries and a peach Bellini.   The calamari was excellent, well cooked and not overdone and rubbery. The ribs were spicy and well cooked. And the peach Bellini was sub par, just tasted like a frozen mixture. It's nothing special, but the portion sizes were huge and costs $32 per plate.   The interiors of the place needs some renovations and redecorating. Broken chairs and tables, not a nice sight for a steakhouse that's doing very well. The customer service is good and the food delivery was fast for a Friday night. My server was very kind, quick and friendly.   I think it's a bit over priced for the ribs however, it's the only halal steakhouse around Toronto so I can see why people would pay extra for it.   I wouldn't come back here just because I felt I paid a lot to eat at a place with broken chairs and tables. Also it's quite far.   I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to eat halal only or else any regular steakhouse such as the Keg or even Pickle Barrel would do."}
{"text":"Affy's is one of those places that leaves you conflicted. I've had nothing but good experiences with the food, but the service and the general state of the restaurant is appalling. At the end of the day, however, the food wins out and I end up coming back.  I've had a number of the chicken dishes, appetizers, etc, and they've all been pretty good. The menu is varied and their specials are always decently priced for what you get. When I really wanna go big, I get the veal chop/chicken wing dinner with mashed potatoes....it's a WHOLE lot of food and it's tasty. Never underestimate the power of an awesome combination like that!   The desserts - from what I recall - were nothing spectacular. Go next door to Flavours and get a creme brulee if you want something sweet. I appreciate that you get complimentary chips and dip. It's a nice touch and a little more fun than the average bread and butter.   The only frustrating part about Affy's is the actual restaurant. It's horribly set up: tables shoved into spaces that should be left as aisles; people seated literally in front of the front door, with cold air blowing in. Families that should have a larger table are crammed into a booth (don't know if they requested a booth or what) and then there are 4-year olds running around, dodging between my legs under the table. SIT THE EFF DOWN. I'm holding a damn steak knife, remember? Hijabi Aunty, please tame your Tarzan.   The waiters and waitresses often willfully seem to ignore you. Our last time there, our waiter buzzed around us several times, catering to a large group seated in front of us. We waited patiently (we realized he had a lot of orders) but we sat for 20 minutes before he came to even take our orders.   Halal pizza joints and Pakistani restaurants are a dime-a-dozen in the GTA, so in that sense, Affy's is one of the few halal places that stands out. But, what bothers me is that they seem to think their novelty is enough - and sadly, for many hard-pressed Muslims, it will be. Affy's will probably only ever step up its game when other non-ethnic halal places start popping up all over, forcing it to live up to its 'premium grill' claim.  Until then, expect pretty good food and sub par service and ambiance."}
{"text":"This would be a 2.5 star over all!  When I was eating the food I remembered chef ramsay's words that when chef are not confident they pour sauce all over.    The location is hidden in the office area of Mississauga and there is plenty of parking.  The restaurant is of a decent size and although they have huge cushion seats but they are not that comfortable.  We tired 7 Ounce Steak with Spicy Peppercorn Gravy and Lemon Herb Chicken. The steak was cooked the way I asked them but the sauce killed it. The chicken was dry and really hard to cut through and again the sauce killed it.  The portion were good but over all we didn't enjoy the food.  The sever was friendly and the service was good.  For my muslim folks - they serve halal meat here."}
{"text":"We went to Affy's as a friend raved about it but I do not understand the hype AT ALL! The food portion is large but the food itself?! DISASTER. I ordered the lemon herb chicken breast..driest piece of meat I have ever eaten, which is ridiculous as it was DOUSED in some horrid flavourless sauce. The mash potato as my side was also swimming in some horrible gravy. Chicken wings as apps was dry as well. The steak sandwich, assuming its a steakhouse, was over cooked (asked for medium) and bland, just appalling. I have no clue what makes them PREMIUM as both the food and the ambiance was cruddy, plus the service was disorganized. They randomly dropped off chips and salsa..the salsa looked as if it was brought over from another table, DISGUSTING! This was the first time we have wasted food at a restaurant, which we are not happy about, but we just couldn't finish the food. Wish there was an option for zero stars...hope I save some people with actual taste for good food, the trouble of venturing to this joint."}
{"text":"Halal Steak House! Enough said... please take my money right now lol.  I was on vacation in Canada with friends, originally from NYC and sad to say that we don't have any authentic Halal steakhouse in NYC. A friend who had previously visited Canada recommend Affy's but the other location, since our hotel was closer to this location that's where we decided to go. Food was absolutely great. It was a first time trying steak and ribs for all us that night and we were glad it was at Affy's after the pleasant experience. The food however was a bit pricey but after all it is a Halal Steakhouse and how many of those are really out there, plus we were on vacation so did not mind spending that much for a wonderful experience. I would definitely drive 500 miles across border to eat here again ;-)  Recommendation: Ribs, Classic Steak, and Stuffed Chicken Breast."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Affy's was in 2008 or 2009. Even back then, the service was terrible, while the food was mediocre at best. This year a friend told me the service and food had gotten better, so I decided to give it a try for Mother's Day.  Worst. Mistake. Ever.  We had reservations and when I called to say I would be a few minutes late - they have a five minute holding time - I was told that I never had a reservation to begin with. Once we arrived and sat down, we were made to wait a good 20 minutes before someone came to get our order. This made absolutely no sense, as we didn't even receive our menus. Before even ordering our actual meals, we ordered our appetizers, as we hoped to get them BEFORE our actual meal. That never happened. People who had arrived after us had received their food while we had not even been served our appetizers. We waited an hour before we decided enough was enough, and asked to speak with the manager. Upon speaking to the manager, we mentioned how we had been waiting and although we understood it might've been busy, we shouldn't be made to wait an hour. The manager stated \"this is how Affy's works.\", before promising to check on our meals. Less than two minutes later we received our appetizers with our actual meals following a minute or so later.  I wish I could say that the food made up for the time wasted waiting, but I'd be lying. My sister and I ordered the exact same Affy's Classic steak with the same peppercorn gravy. While one steak was dry, the other was dripping. It wouldn't have been as bad if it had been dripping in gravy, but it was swimming in some sort of Oil. The Herb Chicken penne we ordered was completely cold and the sauce and cheese had dried. We sent it back, and received a new one very quickly. I ordered poutine separately, but it was combined with a side of steamed vegetables. My sister is lactose intolerant. They should take into consideration that some people may have allergies. On top of that, our glasses smelt strongly of cleaning detergent.  I was incredibly disappointed with the lack of professionalism, and the food. Unless you want to waste an hour to get food, that you'll send back, don't try Affy's."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Affys for my birthday thinking it was gonna be a nice romantic evening. Boy was he wrong!  It was guys sitting wearing no shoes with tooth picks in their mouths making loud laughing noises.  Kids screaming and mothers running around with their kid.  Definitely not the best ambience.  The food we ordered came in ample time but with no flavour.  We had the peppercorn steak and stuffed chicken breast. The portions were average. And there was no salt added in the food.  Didn't feel Like restaurant style food.  I was not too thrilled with the price vs food ratio.   Although halal I would just skip"}
{"text":"Food 2/5 Service 3/5 price for what you get 2/5   I came in a 3 times, each time I tried a different cut of steak.  The meat was way too fatty every time, I would say 40% of my steak was composed of just chunks of fat.  1 of the 3 times I came in my steak was cooked Medium-Rare just as I asked 2/3 times the steak was way over cooked.  Keep in mind that if you want Hallal Steak you can call The Keg or Ruths Chris Steak House and request Hallal meat for your reservation. you have to call in at least 24 hours in advnaced to get a Hallal steak but its more then worth it."}
{"text":"Food here is great! The staff is so friendly and very helpful. Went here with my husband and parents everyone enjoyed the meals. Although a little pricy it's a good place for dinner. The ribs are the best thing on the menu! A must try!"}
{"text":"It is a great  place for Non Ethnic Halal Food."}
{"text":"In terms of halal dining Affy's Premium Grill offers one of the best dining experiences in and around the GTA. Though the restaurant may be located out east in Pickering, I know of many individuals who trek from far and wide just to dine there. Affy's is a prime example of \"If you build it they will come\". Although in this case \"it\" is not a baseball field, but a quality, upscale halal dining experience.   If you find yourself making your way out to this restaurant, it would most likely be to tackle their plethora of meat dishes. Affy's offers a wide array of carnivore delights such as steaks, ribs, burgers, chicken dishes, fajitas and sandwiches. Definitely a good spread and it would be difficult for you to go there and not find something that catches your eye.   On my last visit I had the Classic 14 oz. NY Strip Steak (obviously med-rare) topped with spicy peppercorn gravy and accompanied with sautéed vegetables and fries. Overall the dish was solid, the steak was not incredible but it was cooked well, seasoned well and a satisfying portion. The vegetables were nothing special and the fries were fairly average. I could have probably done with just the steak, but no regrets.    On that same visit I was with a large group so I was fortunate enough to try several other items, one such being the Texas Chicken Fried Sandwich. The chicken is marinated in buttermilk which is mildly acidic thus tenderizing the meat while sealing in the moisture. The deep frying gave it a nice crispy outside while the chicken on the inside remained tender and juicy. The garlic mayonnaise was a nice touch to this sandwich as well.   Another notable item worth mentioning are Affy's gargantuan ribs, an order yields a full rack of tender BBQ back ribs doused in a house BBQ sauce. These were extremely tasty and definitely a sizeable portion. The majority of halal restaurants where I dine typically offer short ribs, so it was a welcome change to see back ribs.   All in all a fine dining experience chez Affy's. Service can be slow at times but the restaurant is typically packed and the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"By just talking about them makes my mouth watery. They have the best ribs and steak in the world!!!!!!!!! I go there at least 2 twice a month."}
{"text":"Decor was nice, place was clean. This Affy's is a little closer to me than the Mississauga and Pickering ones... what can I say... I recognized some of the same staff from the other locations and yes service is just as bad as it is at the other ones. I've been to this location 3 times now. When my actual main dish comes (Cajun Stuffed Chicken Breast) it's great. Unfortunately the stress of chasing down waiters for a drink, straw, napkins, sugar, cream and ketchup is just not worth it for me. The manager Rana was very nice but I still had to ask 3-4 times for my waiter just so I could order and 2-3 times for the bill. Also the fork and glasses were a little dirty.   PS I ordered the brownie for dessert and it was rock hard, almost inedible, I sent it back and it came back harder...oh well."}
{"text":"After going to Affy's for years I have to agree with others that although the food and quality is great the service is what stops me from coming here... the stress of getting a drink and asking for the bill, ketchup and napkins 3 times each is just not worth it. The last 2 times I went the brownie was rock hard and I had to send it back. It's so sad cause Affy's used to be my #1!!"}
{"text":"Juicy steaks, rich gravy, and scrumptious desserts is what I went expecting at Affy's. Having heard a lot of praise I was very excited to go. My parents aren't big fans of steaks and went out for kabobs dropping of my two sisters and myself at the small Pickering strip mall, to what we hoped would be a great evening. When I go to a restaurant there are three things that I look for, that make me want to go there and those three things are atmosphere, service, and above all great food.  Let's start with the atmosphere, the name \"Premium Grill\" makes you picture solid wood tables, family style seating and large chairs right? WRONG. I'm not the skinniest person in the world but this was the first time I had trouble fitting in my seat, well booth anyway. The cramped dark beige booths and particle board tables take me on a flashback to the 50s silent films, the horrid red wallpaper and tacky dim lighting make it feel more like an interrogation room than a family restaurant, definitely not a good place for a party of any sort.  Great service is one of the things that can make your food taste better, it really can and at Affy's it definitely doesn't. The waiter came to us before we even opened our menus! When we were ready to order,I politely called him by name and said excuse me . . . three times! Only to see him gathered with the other waiters throwing balls of napkins at each other and laughing!!   End all be all of a great night out, the food: Okay, so after the most uncomfortable 25 minutes ever at a restaurants the \"waiter\" finally took our order. I got the fillet minion (midrare) and a root beer (25+3), my sister got the sirloin steak w/ shrimp (midwell) and a coke (20+2.5) and my youngest sister got the 7 ounce NY strip (midwell) and a chocolate milkshake (16+5). We also got a cream of mushroom soup (soup of the day, 3.5) and a poutine (4.5). The grand total with tax and tip was a single $100 bill. Pretty pricy for only 3 people. Frankly I have no idea why I left a tip any way. So my fillet minion came well done, despite having a mid rare toothpick I sent it back then it come blood raw, with white fat! The waiter refused to take it back saying I got what I ordered, despite telling him I ordered mid not blue rare it still took 5 minutes of arguing from him to get a properly cooked steak. Tired of complaining I ate half of my \"midrare\" fillet which again came back well done, again. I had to spit out the burnt mushroom and the runny cream. The poutine was not made from fresh potatoes believe you me, insanely salty gravy with fake processed chase. The sides were also disgusting from crunchy rice to mashed potatoes with more garlic than potato and enough salt to de-ice a driveway. Not bad enough for you? How about a chocolate milkshake that barely tastes like chocolate and that nasty gravy smothered over my sisters' steaks, rubbery shrimp and the worst, most vinegary, spicy, disgusting soup I have had in my life. Also the exact same sirloin steak and shrimp combo is available at steakhouse chains (which I will never go to because there chains and not halal, are $9.99-11.99, just to show you how overpriced this crap is).  I hate the fact that these people take advantage of good hardworking Muslims who have no other halal western restaurant to turn to. All I know is unless the management changes I am never going there again. One of the worst experiences of my life.  Update: I did go again, was invited by unknowing family friends, just as crap, raw chicken, shoe leather steaks, are you people dumb?? This place an expensive Mcdonald's with worse service and prices. The ribs are vinegary enough to a kill a horse an insult to the farmers who raised the meat, the chef should hang his head in shame, think about the innocent plants, animals and overbearing rocks (salt) that their gave their life to nourish us, treat food with respect of close your doors, I serious have nothing but pity for you."}
{"text":"Literally been coming to the Pickering location since it opened (around 5-6 years) and this is my absolute favourite restaurant. My mom and I love the stuffed Cajun chicken breast, the Ribeye steak and the chicken Parmesan primavera. All of their appetizers are to die for! They offer two sides with all orders except the ribs which is amazing! My dad loves the ribs and my brother loves the  filet mignon steak, this is definitely my entire familys go-to restaurant! We can eat top notch desi food at home and whenever we crave north American style food, it's always hands down Affys. They wavered in customer service a year ago but they are back to being fantastic! The servers and owners know us really well now too so that might be why the service is always amazing but regardless, the food is spectacular and the prices are very reasonable. They have two new locations in Mississauga and one in New York as well."}
{"text":"Food is garbage, service is nice and friendly but service time and food preparation are horrible. I waited 30 minutes to be seated and almost another 30 minutes for food, the steak they brought out for my child's meal was horrible and cold, it was brought out 15 minutes prior to the rest of the order. The steak is overpriced, they take advantage of Muslims who cannot eat a halal steak within the nearby area, so they jack up their prices. The steak was small, cold, and cooked improperly. Soup was cold and salty, they ran out of potatoes after making me wait 20 minutes. the Waitress was very nice and caring but the crappy cooking time and overall quality of the food took away from a good dining experience. My entire family agrees that it is the last time we will dine there, not worth a Halal steak, might as well just cook at home."}
{"text":"Last night, hit up Affis for Dinner w/ my cousin from Toronto.  The drive from Mississauga to Pickering was 45 mins, so I was thinking to myself...this better be worth it.  We past by a huge pickering masjid, pretty nice Mash'Allah and made our way into a strip mall.  On the corner was a contemporary restaurant sing that read 'Affys Premium Grill', suttle yellow font on a black backdrop sign.  Gave it a bit of a more elegant look.  The outside of the restaurant was well kept and clean looking.  We went past the entrance and the hostess (Aunty wearing hijab...probably my moms age) seated us in a nice leather booth setting.  The ambiance was a mix of younger couples and some older 'Anniversary celebrating' 50 year old types.  The menu was quite simple, however, I simple just made my way to the steak portion of the menu since that is all that I was interested in.  My cousin, who is an avid steak eater promised that the Filet Mignon marinated in peppercorn and topped with Feta and homemade peppercorn sauce, and roasted portabella top is esentially the best item to try if I wanted steak.  He got his medium rare while I got mine medium.  The dishes came with two sides, so my cousin selected fries and mashed potatoes and I subsided to vegetables and caesar salad.  Additionally, my cousin ordered a skillet of mushrooms, sounds enticing and it truly was.  After waiting for about 20 mins, our items came and from the looks of it, I was not to pleased but once I took my steak knife and cut through the meat...I could tell this may just be one of the best Zabiha non-ethnic steak joints...so I take the succulent juicy meat into my mouth and it was perfectly cooked and the core was the right temperature and there was some pinkness but just enough to make the meat taste oh-so-juicy as I took in all the flavors of the sauce, shroom and feta.  Wow, what an experience.  Our side order of skillet mushrooms came right on the skillet...making splattering sounds, fumes, smelled real nice and I took a couple of pieces of the shrooms and topped it on my steak and ate it along side my grilled vegetables.  I downed the whole steak in about 10 mins, my cousin and I barely talked...it was that good."}
{"text":"Food was meh, nothing exciting and I think their quality haz dropped over the years. Need to revamp the menu and bring some good change."}
{"text":"This place is packed and for good reason. Even though my family of 9 had to wait about 20-30 minutes to get seated, it was worth the weight. I ordered their ribeye steak and it was full of flavor and seasoning. I loved it. The rest of my family also enjoyed their orders/ dishes.  The only thing I would say about this place is that for the amount of people that come here, it really needs to look into investment for possibly expanding the restaurant. The restaurant is quite small, but it has a modern vibe, nice ambiance, and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Inconsistency is usual here I guess .. they served a fillet mignon (medium) cooked to perfection, but the side of mashed potatoes was a mess, and the ceasers salad was sad. The other item ordered was a rib eye (mid well), but was dried out completely. Ribs taste good but I wonder why do they get the thickest bones .. I get ribs to make at home, but haven't seen the bones as thick as they get. Down rated since they can't control their performance .."}
{"text":"I've been to Affy's multiple times because it is one of the very few halal steakhouses. Affy's was one of the pioneers of serving halal traditional North American food.  The main customer base for Affy's are folks who only eat halal food. If you are one of those people then you'll enjoy Affy's. if you aren't, then most chances you won't enjoy Affy's because you have much more options for western food which taste much better.  Since I've been here around 10x , I've tasted almost everything on the menu at least once. The appetizers are 2/5, I've never had a good appetizer to this day.   Their burgers are decent but are often great value (3.5/5). Each burger comes with a side, and there are a a good variety of burgers to choose from. I really enjoy the Roast Beef BBQ sandwich which is quite tasty and filling. The other great option is the Texas Fried Chicken burger. The piece of chicken on that burger is relatively large and taste good as well, that's why it's a go to for a bunch of my friends.  The steaks at Affy's suck 1/5. I've had them at multiple occasions thinking they will somehow get better each time. They aren't cooked to my liking (most of the time they are just well done). They have come out cold and often take forever to be served.  The salads are okay. I usually get one of the salads and put extra meat in them.  The fajitas and sizzlers are decent as well (3/5). I've tried them each once which I enjoyed. However they aren't anything special to make me try them again.  The two most popular entrees I'd say are the stuffed Cajun chicken breast and the bbq ribs. I personally don't eat stuffed chicken breasts so I won't rate it. However, most of the people I visit the restaurant really enjoy it.  The best thing on the menu by far is the full stack of bbq ribs. It's fairly expensive but definitely worth it. I still prefer Affy's bbq ribs even when compared to other non-halal joints. I'd give the ribs close to a 5/5.  The service at Affy's is horrendous. At a few occasions I've had to wait for at least an hour for my food. I wouldn't recommend visiting this place in a big group because the food comes out cold as they take so long to make it. If it wasn't a specialty restaurant, I'd never put up with their shitty service. Sometimes they are okay, sometimes they are horrible. So please beware ! This place is extremely busy on holidays like eid and iftaar time.  Affy's is a below average restaurant with select dishes which taste fantastic. If it's your first time, I'd get a burger as they are good value. If you like them, then you can start risking their entrees as they become pricier (often not worth it like their crappy steaks). In the end, you'll end up find the special thing that you like... for me it's the roast beef sandwich and the ribs!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this restaurant over the past few years because it's halal and has a lot of meat options. I finally went the other day and I am so disappointed. It was totally overrated. The food took 40+ minutes to come (although they did give some bad-tasting nachos in the beginning for the wait) and I was so excited to try the ribs but they were pretty dry and not very tasty. I personally had the chicken parmesan pasta which was good, I liked the chicken, but the cheesiness was too much. This place is also overpriced and totally packed. I didn't try the steak, but if I go back I'll try that. And if that's not good either, I don't know if this place will be top of my list for places to go when I'm hungry. It was just mediocre tasting food. Meh."}
{"text":"I would put less than 1 star if possible. Absolutely GARBAGE food. I do not say that lightly. I literally made a yelp account to make sure other people do not eat here. Yes, it is halal, but it is overpriced frozen food badly made. The burger was so dry I couldn't stomach it. Wings tasted so so old. Chicken caeser salad tasted bad and I didn't even think it was possible to screw that up!! The steak was okay, (2.5 stars/5 stars) , but everything else was literally terrible. I regret eating that."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience! They take an hour to bring out the food. The service is horrible. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Average food. I strongly recommend against eating here. Extremely noisy because of a huge blender that is placed in the sitting area and not in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been to Affys on numerous occasions and I can say that I've never had a complaint about the food. The food is always great I typically order the Cajun chicken breast or one of the burgers. Not only are the main dishes good but the sides are great too (poutine mashed potatoes etc.)   The only concern about the restaurant I have is the service, at times it can be extremely slow or to even get the attention of the waiter takes forever. Food wise everything is fine however the service could be a bit better."}
{"text":"Heard. Lot of good things about this resturant.  Very disappointed.  The order was taken after a very long. Did not even serve water.  Food came extra late. Ordered the New York steak which was cold, dry and not worth eating.  At the end was had to wait 25-30 mins for the bill.  Would not recommend this resturant at all."}
{"text":"Affy's is the first halal place I've eaten at for more \"western type foods\" such as steaks, pastas, and burgers.The food was really good. Everyone in my family ate every last morsel off their plate. I asked for a well done steak and it came out perfect(rare occurrence at other places) My pasta was a creamier then expected but still hot and good. I ordered the strawberry daiquiri which was average. It took around 20 minutes for our food to come out though and the restaurant wasn't close to be being packed. Cons would include the fact that we were seated right at the door next to the podium where the host stands so everyone that came in after stood and waited right over us. The table was forcefully crammed and my 6 foot father had to squeeze himself in. We also ordered a pina colada but apparently they had to wait for more juice and instead of the 10 more minute wait that we were told, it came to our table a few minutes before we got up to leave. I'd go back jsut because of the fact that there arent many places that serve this type of food halal."}
{"text":"It takes a lifetime to get the food here. Expect to be waiting an hour until you get your plate. I always get the  steak that comes with a portobello mushroom and cheese but they've started skimping out on the me mushroom and cheese lately."}
{"text":"Affy's is a really hit and miss place. I've eaten here twice. They're quite pricey although portions are not bad.   Their steak and ribs were not that good even though the original Affy's in Pickering prides itself on these foods and what this place is known for. What I did like from the menu was the stuffed chicken with spinach and the wings are great for the price.   The decor is nice but I don't like the squished layout of the restaurant. We usually got the corner booth at the end of the restaurant and the past two times I went other tables could be heard - people's conversations echo and it gets very loud that you can't hear your own voice. They could've spaced tables further apart. I also do not like that they don't take reservations.   Other than that, Affy's food is pretty good. If you're big on steak and meaty foods, then you can get your halal fix here.  Edit: went a third time a few months ago and the food and service suck big time. Blech food and waiting 30 mins for food with a hungry baby is not worth it."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place in Meadowvale, open past 8 on a Sunday with healthy options on the menu, Affy's Premium Grill was one of our only options. My parents live down the street and have for years and have never noticed this spot. It's located in an industrial park and was difficult to spot in the evening.  It does get very busy, so make sure to make reservations. The restaurant fills up very quickly. Service was very polite and fast. The menu has options for a wide range of tastes, everything does tend to be seasoned on the spicier side (without any indication on the menu to this fact). There are no alcoholic options on the menu, this was not an issue for our group, but just so other yelpers know. The hubs had a chicken ceasar - chicken looked dry but was actually moist and tender. The caesar dressing had a hint of spice in it which was unexpected but not unwelcome. Dad had filet of sole (fish and chips) with a baked potato. Breading was still a bit gummy/underdone in places but the flavor was there and the lemon cream sauce on it was rather good. My StepMom had a chicken skillet with the sauce on the side. Sauce was a spicy thai sauce - chicken, veggies and basmati rice were all quite good, but the rice being directly against the skillet made it hot and dry in parts. I had the top sirloin, topped with shrimp without either of the sauces they offer (foos ateak stands alone, damnit). I usually need to add salt to my steak, this was not required. Cooked to perfection, tender and well seasoned. Where things went amiss was at the end of the meal. We ordered coffee while deciding on dessert. When dessert came, coffee did not (without any explanation) server said they were brewing another pot. In the meantime, we ate the 'skillet apple cumble.' it was a piece of apple pie, on a piping hot fajita skillet with iced cream on top. We all burnt pur mouths and the iced cream was completely melted in short order. By the time we finished, still no sign of coffee. Apparently it didn't come out well, finally we stopped waiting and took off.  Tl;dr Good food (albeit spicy), good service, no alcohol, skip dessert."}
{"text":"Respect yourself and respect your dollar. Do not go to Affy's \"Premium\" Grill. Please read this review.  This review has been long over due. I've been to Affy's around seven times over three years - each experience was worse than my preceding visits. I've sworn off this place every time, but I end up here because my friend always wants to come here. He has officially sworn off this \"restaurant\" as of tonight.  To begin, the service is absolutely horrendous. You're seated after 5-10 minutes of waiting (which is standard), then you wait an additional ten minutes before a server actually tends to you. When someone finally decides to come to your table and you place your order, you wait an average of 35 minutes for your meal to arrive. The maximum I have ever waited was 55 minutes.  Every single time I ate at Affy's, there has ALWAYS been something wrong with my food. It's either cold or not cooked right. Today, my chicken came pink, which could have put me at risk of being hospitalized. I spoke to the manager about this politely and respectfully, and he immediately went on the defense saying I was wrong, and that the \"seasoning made the chicken pink\". He then backtracks and says that they cook their chicken pink. The manager said that they intentionally do not fully cook the chicken which may potentially cause salmonella poisoning. After five minutes of back and fourth with the manager, with him being incredibly rude to me, he brings me back another chicken breast where half of it is once again uncooked. My friend on the other hand, ordered his steak medium well. It was cooked well done, and Affy's insulted our intelligence by telling us that, once again, the seasoning was burned, and gave it that illusion when in fact the meat was cooked well done. We sucked it up, ate was edible, paid and left.   Previous encounters at this restaurant included my friends steak not being cooked properly, steaming my vegetables when it was advertised as sautéed (they also argued with me that it was not steamed). On one occasion, they were arguing with my friend to eat their steak medium rare when he did not want to. DISCLAIMER: they do not know how to properly cook or season steak. I ordered medium rare once, it came well done. They also put gravy on the steak. Anyone who has had a half decent steak knows that putting gravy in it ruins the integrity of the meat.  The manager did the one thing a manager should not do - argue with the customer and make them leave mad. He did not apologize, nor did he comp anything from our bill. To put this into perspective, if you visit The Keg Steakhouse, your whole bill would have been comped and the manager would have expressed his sincerest apologies. The manager at Affy's does not care, and is more than happy to spit in the face of the customer.  Please, respect yourself and respect the hard work you put in to get your money. Do not go to Affy's \"Premium\" Grill."}
{"text":"Great food. Tried the stuffed chicken and steak. I got mine medium well and it was fantastic. Poutine and mashed potatoes were good. The gravy they use is good too."}
{"text":"Is there an option for 0 stars? I mean why are they even in the food business to begin with?  They bait customers in by using fancy words like \"halal fine steakhouse dining\". Ummm NO that is WRONG.  Food 0 Staff 0   Took the food reasonable time to come out, about 15 minutes to 20. But it was cold dry and bland.. Absolutley no taste or any flavours at all.  When asked the waiteress she replied why didn't you tell me when i came by asking if all was good and she left.  The entire waiting staff there is full of attitude.  And they fight amongst themselves loud in front of customers.  I would never return to this place for a second chance as all of my group complained the same about their food.   Save your hard earned money and dine somewhere else. This place is expensive and sucks big."}
{"text":"Yummmmy!!!  The food here was delicious and the service was great. Last time I came it was jampacked and it was a different story but this time around there was almost no one here because we came at an odd time in the afternoon.    -I got the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich  -my friend got the regular chicken sandwich and both are really good!!!   The Buffalo tasted a little bit more like a barbecue sauce rather than Buffalo but nonetheless was still very delicious!   -the fries were really crispy -the Caesar salad was delicious  I got the mocktail: strawberry, banana, peach. It was really really delicious!    Will for sure be back next time and so glad that it's Halal!!"}
{"text":"The ambience is not really good but if you want good tasty halal food it great option. The steaks are good but the best one is rib eye. I have gone multiple times and some days they make the steak iwell done  instead of medium rare. Some days it's just perfect. Generally there aren't many great halal steak places so this is definitely a worthwhile option."}
{"text":"Let me start with the service--it was horrible, they were short staffed! Forgot our cocktail and was never served. Asked for ketchup few times and never got it. Side salad for our main meal came after almost finishing the main, asked for kids meal to served first and came last. We went during Ramadan and had to wait for water past iftar time.On top of all that there roof was leaking!! So not a great experience.  Food: nothing to write home about. Ribs were dry and needed more sauce. Burger also patty was dry.  Overall not a great experience and specially when you always have to look for server for your ketchup, sides, kids meal, drinks etc how can you enjoy your meal!!!"}
{"text":"So Devan has posted a solid review, please make sure to read it prior to or immediately following this one.  I love Affy's. I will not go through all the menu options as there are many, and they've just revamped their menu, however I will say that everything is a solid 4 or 5 stars. They are one of the few halal restaurants that know how to cook a steak, and for this I thank them.  My fav's are the spinach and cheese stuffed chicken breast, steak (honestly any steak from there will do), and the ribs which are definitely gargantuan.   For desert you HAVE to try their home made brownie, topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and some sauce I can't remember (maybe chocolate?). I can't explain my deep love for this dessert brownie. It takes me about 25-30 minutes to get to Affy's and I would come just for the brownie. It is just that good.  PS- the service WAS lacking before, however they've addressed these concerns and the service is great now."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, and well appointed.  The servers really care about their job, and try to make you as happy as possible.  The food - well, it's food. I'm really struggling to come up with something to say about it, and I cannot, because it was a mediocre meal, with an average price.  Hoped to have some saving grace in dessert, but they don't have an espresso machine, and the cake I had was supermarket variety.  Will not repeat, if I don't have to."}
{"text":"The streak was really good, as always with lots of onions and mushroom on top, just how I ordered but the chicken fajita was on the not-so-delicious side. But still very juicy and well made. Also, really clean place to dine at also. I will revisit this place for another review"}
{"text":"I've been here multuple times since they opened the Mississauga location (original is in Pickering).  It's one of the very few non-Desi/Hakka Halal restaurant options in the GTA. I'm a fan overall, I almost always order the stuffed chicken breast and the sauce is buttery and delicious. I once had the creamy spinach/pita dip and it was amazing. I've attached a photo of the chicken pasta (steak pasta on the menu but I requested chicken instead) - it was good except that there was too much sauce and the sauce was very liquidy.   They need to work on consistency and speed of service, including bringing out food for a group at the same time."}
{"text":"Nice looking place for a halal restaurant. The menu has lots of options. The burgers and fajitas are really good."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place- it's bright and new, service is fast and friendly, but it was disappointing. Our food was bland: new york strip steak, mashed potatoes, calamari, fish and chips...none of them were flavourful. And all of it was positively SLATHERED in sauce and/or gravy."}
{"text":"A series of unfortunate events.  - Made a reservation on labour day and got there 5 minutes earlier, were told to wait despite our reservation, got seated shortly afterwards.  - Server didn't come to take our order for 15 minutes, later on when we inquired about it, we got to know that there was a miscommunication and there was no server assigned to our table, order was taken 5 minutes afterwards.  - Missed onions in Chicken Parmesan, sent it back, same past came back with onions added.  FOOD: Whats good? Steak is pretty decent and fish and chips is pretty good as well  What's not good? Pretty much everything else we have tried. This is the only place i know which serves a full rack of halal ribs(Black ox closed down :( ) and unfortunately their ribs aren't great. Ribs are overcooked and are crispy from the outside, some people might like it, but thats not how ribs are supposed to be. Pasta and burgers were average."}
{"text":"Good food when busy, cold food when free.  I have been to this restaurant multiple times. The only thing i like here is their fish fingers or fish and chips. The rest of the stuff (steak/ribs etc) is mediocre at best.  Last night was not very busy and everything that was served to us was cold. Wings were soggy, we called our server and said these wings are not fresh and cold, she warmed it, brought it back and said \"Fresh wings for you sir\", while we could clearly tell its just microwaved.  Mashed potatoes tasted funny yesterday, three of us checked and mutually agreed there is something wrong with it. We called the manager, had him try and he said he doesn't find anything wrong with except that it's cold, just kept explaining on how the potatoes are different etc etc. They sent us a new plate of mashed potatoes, it was warm but had the same taste, maybe the cream was bad or something. We also told him about the wings and how they were just microwaved, he didn't reply to it.  The bill came and he took the wings off from it, which was a nice gesture, but there was still no explanation.  The price is not worth the food or the service you get here. For halal eaters, Black ox would be a much better choice."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steak Sandwich and I enjoyed it. It was cooked medium as I ordered it and was not hard to chew. I would definitely order it again.   My wife on the other had ordered the Stuffed Chicken Breast and she found it bland and forgettable. We read good things about it and that's why she ordered it. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the expectations.  Service is great. However, it took us over 30 minutes to get our food. Decor of this place is not something to write home about."}
{"text":"Came here the second time first being the Pickering location...and again was disappointed with my order for medium rare steak. Was not happy with the service either..."}
{"text":"I've had a very mixed experience with Affys, it is completely dependent on your luck if you will see be good or bad side of Affy's.  Firstly when you walk in it's a very sad atmosphere with employees though very polite seem uninterested and sad. I understand everyone has their problems but it just brings down the entire restaurant environment and customer experience. The food is overpriced for the quantity they give which is not a lot sometimes. Which brings me to my next issue the food you get is very unpredictable maybe you'll get a large quantity one day the other you will get very little quantity wise. One day the food will be delicious like the cheese stuffed chicken I got and the next day it'll be like the horrible like when I got the cheese stuffed chicken again and the cheese was still sold as ice. Which brings me to my last point of how if you will defrost your food and serve people overpriced frozen food then at least try to make an effort to defrost it properly. I ordered a tiramisu which was so frozen I was basically chewing and crunching on the ice cubes while tasting a watered down tiramisu yes watered down was the exact taste I'm assuming cause of the ice melting. If I wanna we frozen foods I'd go to Walmart and buy it for $5 not $50 that Affy's Charged.  Overall polite employees, and the food is really all dependent on luck. Management/Organization needs major changes"}
{"text":"Went to eat there last night,  a group of 5. Busy place, I had a burger, it was burnt, the cook really did not care about cooking it and I did not complain either.  But how can anyone not know to how to cook a burger ... also ordered 14oz new York steaks, meat cut was really good but .. again it was too rare pink but not warm in the middle. They gave very little sauce, gravy, with steak so tasted dry. Chicken fajitas was very nice. Well done steak was good too. Will come again sometime later in the year as there are better steak places in mississauga. Service is terrible as usual. Not a disappointing place to eat."}
{"text":"Halal Meat is served here, Per signs on window and Owners are Known Muslims. This location is a smaller place than their original location in Pickering so I suggest to call ahead if you have a large party. Went here last night and had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table because the place was packed, but it was well worth the wait!  I ordered the 12 oz Ribeye Steak (Medium Well) with side of mashed potato and vegetables. The steak was cooked properly and also had some fat on it which a good piece of steak is supposed to have!  It melted in my mouth!  The steak was very flavorful with gravy, onions and mushrooms. I also had chicken quesadilla appetizer which was very good as well. Anyways, the only thing i was not to fond of was the gravy in the mashed potato, but its all about the steak at this place! Service is friendly. Next time I come here will check out the BBQ ribs!"}
{"text":"Came with my wife for the second time, the first time was great 4/5 cuz of the lack of heat in winter time.  2nd time we came in, the waiter told us they have a table ready for us but \"they did not hire enough waiters so we are short and will take 30mins to just take our orders\".   Given we are from Richmond hill we chose to stay, they are still using portable heaters...come on guys it's winter time lets invest in heaters. Terrible decor and seating arrangements. I feel like they got the wallpaper from Canadian tire and got their 14yr old cousin to apply to save on labour because parts are falling off. They also have the ice crusher next to a bunch of tables which is so loud that people stop conversations because it is too loud.   The food is great but that's it. You have to wait a long time for your food while your freezing inside the restaurant and look at poor decor..."}
{"text":"Wow, that was pretty bad. We went for lunch. The first clue should have been that it was 12:30 and not another soul in there. Let's start with the very stale chips that were brought out with salsa. I ordered the filet, which was very obviously not a filet and on top of that was tough and chewy. It was supposed to come with a demi glace and feta. There was no demi glace (or they don't know what one is) and there was one square hunk of feta on top of the middle of the steak. One person at our table got the 10oz new York strip, pitiful looking and tough, and one got the ribeye....again low quality."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the place. I remember how good the missisauga one was . And their service. But this place out did them. I wanted to go to Affy's but after my last experience at the Pickering location I was scared.  But this location is great clean, nice service , good food. Natasha and Rana were both good at serving and helped in whatever way they could. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"First time at Affy's Mississauga. Ordered the Stuffed Cajun (w/ salad, baked potato) and 12oz Rib Eye Streak (w/ salad, mashed potato). Both wife and I were satisfied with the protein offerings - the chicken was flavorful and juicy and the steak was tender and remained at the perfect temperature thanks to the sizzling skillet. The same cannot be said about the sides, especially the salad. The salad was mainly lettuce with a bit of raw onions and tomatoes. When one is paying premium prices ($15 chicken, $28 steak) you'd expect for the entire meal to be premium. The baked and mashed potatoes were decent but nothing to write home about.  We also ordered a side of fried ($3). While the fries were decent, at a premium restaurant it would be better if the fried had a home cut feel rather than something out of a bag.   Lastly we ordered molten lava cake ($6). The cake was awesome and the wife and I were left wishing there was more!  Ambience was ok. I have been to better looking restaurants with much cheaper menus.   All in all a good experience. Reason for 3 stars is bc when you pay premium prices ($68 after tax/tip for two) you'd expect all of the food/ambience to be premium. The only reason Affy's is able to command such high prices is bc there aren't too many other halal steak joints in Mississauga (yet!)."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is around is because it's one of the only halal places offering a dine in experience with western themed food.   The service is horrendous. Staff talk instead of walking around to see what customers need service and avoid eye contact.  You wait hours for your food, even when they aren't busy.   As more halal places pop up with proper service they will suffer unless they make drastic changes   We requested separate bills but they refused to service us and they had one waiter working the whole place. Was a horrible experience"}

I ask the server then only she said she will take the order. Just about to lose my patience waiting for the food. Very hot Harb chicken penne pasta supposedly missed any other flavour . They should call it \"chilli flakes pasta to be honest. Server didn't mention it. However couldn't eat. Probably bad luck at diner table I guess. || Cheese Spinach & Eggplant Dip with tortilla was okay.  _______  Affy's Premium Grill, Scarborough Branch"}
{"text":"Meeting my old University roommates Tuesday night.  Called to make reservations at this location.  A gentleman answered the phone and although he did the job to book, he was not as cheery and pleasant as some other places.  Some of my co-workers had made recommendations to try this place out so I had to go.  Although the recommendations were to order the famous steak, I wasn't feeling that I wanted to eat beef that night.  I get in at the reservation time and the waiter comes by to ask if we were waiting on one other person because my friend had not shown up yet.  We told him we would wait to order until he arrives.  When he arrived, the place got super-busy.  It was so busy that the waiter forgot about us and kept on going to other tables to serve.  We had to wave him down to come to our table and place the order.  I ordered the Stuffed Blackened Chicken Breast with mixed veggies and mashed potatoes for $15.  It came out in 20 minutes.  The decor is a little dim but it's a nice modern look/finish.  May get a little noisy but not too bad.  When the dishes arrived and placed on the table, my order didn't look too impressive and unfortunately, it didn't impress me in taste either.  The chicken was dry, no matter if it was filled with cheesy goodness and sauce on top.  The taste of the blackened seasoning was very light with a hint of spice.  Don't get me started on the veggies.  They were practically boiled and then tossed some oil on them to make them glisten.  The mashed potatoes were pretty flavourless.  I think the only thing that was decent about this meal was the filling inside the chicken breast.  That was cheesy and tasty.  But that's it.  The waiter came back and asked us if we wanted separate bills, to which we agreed.  When you go, please go for the steak and let me know!"}
{"text":"In my last visit I got ribs which were full of fat and it was so fatty that I could not eat at all.  Plus another disgusting thing which is noticed is on my way to washroom I saw they put these racks of ribs on a steel tray on top of garbage can which is way disgusting. If I saw that before ordering then would not have ordered though I did not eat any so I am safe.  Not expecting this kind of service from Affys"}
{"text":"AAA steak is a must if you go there!!!!!!!! And Ribssssssss!!!!!!!!  I I love the mango drinks there also. So yea jusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssst yooooooooooooooooooooou.  Mussssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssst."}
{"text":"We went there after a while reservation was done over the phone , got a good table.our server was very good we ordered steaks and ribs , my daughter ordered the penne steak pasta it was amaaazing , and yess we did ordered the the garlic bread and quesidia for starters they were ok not the best. Well for the family of we ended up at 169$ whick is ok as the steaks were well worth."}
{"text":"Since the service sucks at this place, I thought of ordering takeout. I called yesterday and spoke with the owner Afzalbhai, I asked for his opinion on some of the items on the menu, his reply was quote\" I don't have time for this, I have a lot of catering orders and I am busy, can't discuss the menu with you, bye\" and he hung up the phone. This guy is rude and has no concept about customer service. Don't bother going to this place, the service sucks and the owner does not give crap about your business."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The beef ribs are perfect and the eggplant dip is also amazing. Definitely recommend.   Downsides: the atmosphere is mehhh at best, they don't serve alcohol.."}
{"text":"I like the staffs casual dress code, it makes me feel at home. I liked the prompt and courteous customer service. The berry dream was like its name, truly a dream. The rib eye steak is amazing. The Cajun stuffed chicken breast and BBQ sandwich were both splendid. Overall my experience was a delight. I recommend it if you're on the fence."}
{"text":"Not a fine dining experience at all. Served us old appetizers which didn't look presentable nor tasted fresh. The management was talking so loud that it looked like I was sitting in Timmy's. I can give 2 to the main meal that we ordered which was lemon chicken and stuffed chicken which was good but nothing wow. We ordered garlic bread for appetizers and honestly it tasted like the ones you find at Walmart. Presentation zero. The cutlery was not so very clean as well."}
{"text":"Walking distance from Four Points by Sheraton and many other Hotels this restaurant is hidden in the industrial area of Missisauge is definately worth the detour, i'm writting this review after a minimum of 4-5 visits to this same exact location ! I usually visit Affy's off peak weeknights but surprisingly the location attracts allot of groups ! Ive tried their steaks (rib eye, new york etc) and aswell their beef ribs ! Im so in love with their meat and always impressed by its quality, size & taste that i never \"risked\" to order anything else from their menu even if several time friends have told ne to try their burgers ! I often visit the location on my own and i always get an exceptional service from the waiter, even if they are pretty busy and im occupying a banquet by myself, i have never felt rushed or pressure to clear the area so that they can seat a group ! I loved the chicken stuffed jalapeno... The meat is so tender and soft for the rest you can view my photos because an image is worth a million words !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  And it's halal!! Best steak. I recommend getting medium well. Also the taramasui is to die for"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! The ribs are to die for and the steak is always prefectly made to your liking"}
{"text":"It's a good place for family and friends. They have lots of seating to accommodate large groups.Friendly waiters and a small area to pray at the back. Have always ordered fish with lemon gravy and shrimps. It is enough for three of us. My sister was disappointed when she ordered the beef burger on their suggestion, as it was very dry and had no salt.  My uncle ordered ribs, he liked it and says it's not very pricey. The devil's chocolate is good for people who love's chocolate. Rest can have cheese cake."}
{"text":"As far as the food is concerned, Affy's has the best halal steaks in Toronto by far. I've been there a number of times and have never been disappointed with the food. My favourite dish has to be the Cajun chicken stuffed with cheese. Delicious every time!   As for the decor and service, there is definitely room for improvement. Service runs slow some nights and the decor is a little too dark and dingy for my taste.   However when the food tastes this good, the decor is the last thing on my mind and slow service is forgiven!"}
{"text":"Prices for food other than steaks are quite reasonable.  The burger I had was very good.  The food for our large group came out very quickly.  I was pleasantly surprised as I find many halal places usually don't need to have good quality food due to the fact that halal diners often have limited options.  Good experience!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place as we don't get halal steak in Los Angeles. Unfortunately it fell short. The steak wasn't cooked properly, and the only taste comes from the gravy, the steak has no marination. Giving this place a 3 as it is halal steak and the price is fair."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and sometimes the service can be hit and miss.  Tonight the service was great - very quick and attentive and friendly.  We ordered stuffed chicken breast which was great along with a cheeseburger and kids strips.  All of which were satisfying.  Poutine appetizer wasn't the best as the fries were frozen fries instead of fresh cut so they weren't all tender and crisp.   Other than that all was very good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the few cozy steakhouses in the GTA. This is the closest to my house and my go to restaurant. The food is absolutely amazing. The staff is very friendly and respectful. Choosing what you want to eat can be confusing, but the amazing staff will suggest their best dishes. I have tried Wagyu and Kobe beef and the steaks here are of the higher quality compared to other steakhouses. The steak is high quality, perfectly marbled and always will be made to your liking. The manager comes around to ask about your experience which is a nice touch. There is a variety of dessert and drink options and they're delicious. The restaurant has a bit of a dark steakhouse look however it does need to improve cleanliness since I noticed some dust on the windows and dirt on the ground. However overall , this is one of the top halal restaurants in the GTA"}
{"text":"I am a regular here. But I was there this Friday October 06-2017. They were so busy I had to wait 45 mins to get seated. This one server there( I don't know why they kept him there this long) he always have an attitude problem. Any ways, I order the chicken and my wife order the steak. It was soooo dry we couldn't eat it. But we were told it will take a long time to get another meal.  I only eat halal food and I support halal Restaurant . I think these halal restaurant takes advantage when they get too big and too busy. They have lost my business. There are many other halal restaurants out there and I am going to support them. Affy's will never be on my choice of list again."}
{"text":"The food is usually good but the last time I came here I got food poisoning. I was sick for days and that was during Ramadan :(  the place could use a decor upgrade"}
{"text":"I would have to say that this place opened my halal eyes to whole new taste-buds. This isn't the regular ethnic halal restaurant that people might mistake it for. It is very different and very very tasty.   Affy's is a very busy restaurant. The food here is quite vast in its ethnicity. You have the Italian dishes, the burgers, and the steak. My wife's favourite dish is the chicken stuffed with spinach and cheese along with the cajun burger. I, myself, have had many different dishes and enjoyed every single one. The pastas are tasty along with the steak. Mind you, I haven't had halal steak or lamb chops in my whole life. I think my mom used to make steak at home but then again that was when I was too young to remember.   The staff is very friendly. We have never had any issues with them or any complaints. Since it is quite busy all the time you have to make reservations. The only thing I would say is that I wish it was more central. For people from the Peel region, it's quite the trek. But then again, for tastes like Affy's, I would do it and also recommend others to at least try it once."}
{"text":"What we ordered: Half rack ribs with poutine and 3 steaks (sirloin and New York strip). It was not authentic poutine . fries were crispy and gravy was good but they use shredded cheese instead of cheese curds. Ribs were flavourful but the ends were burnt I was upset about that. The ribs were actually my favorite here. It was as if the chef thought they could disguise the burnt Part with the BBQ sauce. The other order was the sirloin, sides were good. We ordered one steak well done and the second medium-well but the chef made both steaks med-well. Servers were really nice. The restaurant looks old and could use a paint job and replace the ripped seats in the booth. You can't market yourself as a steakhouse and provide cheap seating like its fast food. Overall affys dropped the ball in this market. They were the first of a kind in the halal steak  business and practically had a monopoly. Crave grill or heartland area steak houses wouldn't have been successful had they not been cheap. Affys is like blackberry, the name gets your attention but once you regain your senses you know it's a bad investment."}
{"text":"We didn't have to wait for a life time for the food. The ambience however is not the very best. The complimentary chips and salsa were not very fresh. The salsa was cold and the chips tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. We didn't complain as it was complimentary anyway. Recommend not to order the Calamari. It was extremely rubbery and felt like was thrown in the deep fryer from it's frozen state. The stuffed chicken breast was decent but overpriced. The vegetables that came on the side felt like they came out from a prepackaged frozen bag and were just thrown in boiling water."}
{"text":"Hardcore Halaloos love this place. Those who aren't hardcore Halal don't.  See, the problem is their steak and other high priced items are pretty meh. Pretty ho hum average.   But their hamburgers, chicken burgers & sandwiches and philly cheesesteak are epic especially at that price point.    The good:  The burgers/sandwiches are priced the same as McDonald's but the quality is exceptional for the price. Seriously the cheesesteak (only available during secret lunch menu is unreal) The grilled and fried chicken burgers are amazing. Again, these would be double the price at other steakhouse's.  The bad: The steaks. The Halal Premium prices for those steaks.  The ugly: The Pickering and Mississauga locations have different qualities of food and service."}
{"text":"I am surprised at how many ratings and reviews I see that are less than 4 STARS.   If you don't want to give them 5 STARS I understand because nobody is perfect and no restaurant will please everyone. But if you don't give them 4 STARS, there's a problem with your review.  Aside from the delicious food they serve, the warm hospitality you receive from the time that you enter the door and the modesty and humbleness (is that a word?) of the owner who makes an effort to make you feel at home and that you enjoy your meal, this restaurant is definitely a bang for your buck.  I have been there about 8 or 9 times and am not as frequent of a customer but when I need to find a tasty and fairly priced Halal joint to visit with family or friends near Ajax this is it."}
{"text":"Honestly as soon as I stepped into the restaurant the place was dirty. The cup was stuck on the table. There were dead insects near the windows. The restaurant was not clean at all."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service isn't so great. You have to wait a while till you get you food usually half an hour to 40 mins. But it's also great because it halal."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to affys after a friend recommendation. We thought it was going to be a nice night out nothing fancy but still nice. But boy were we wrong! There were people sitting with no shoes and kids running around and walking up to different tables and mothers shouting. It definitely seemed as if I had entered Indian/Pakistani market. I am personally not the biggest fan of kids and there were so many kids which started to give me panic attacks with all of there shouting and running so when my fiance asked if we could switch tables we were told no right away and no one even bothered to actually look. The place was very loud and it does not look great at all. We ordered a steak and burger and the kitchen took it's time, and when the food came it didn't look that great. My fiance steak was flooded with gravy. You could see they tried to hide a thin thin steak using the gravy. My burger wasn't the best either. For the money we spend here the ambience, the environment and the food was just not worth it. I will definitely tell people to steer far far away from this place."}
{"text":"I challenge anyone to find me a Chicken Burger (that is Halal ofcourse) better than Affy's in Durham, because I'd love to go there too!   Updating my review to five stars. There quality now is consistent and love the food there."}
