{"text":"There isn't too much to say about G Door. It's your typical college bar with cheap beer and too many people. It's actually bigger than it looks from the outside. There are some dart boards in the middle section of the bar, and there is pool in the back room. Service is average. I like coming here more than other bars in Oakland because there is plenty of standing room and you need a table, but otherwise there  isn't too much that sets it apart from any other bar in the area though. The women's bathroom is tiny and crowded, and there is nowhere to wait if the stalls are full. Not bad, not great, but it gets the job done!"}
{"text":"i. Love. G. Door!
They run a great business, as is evidenced by their large base of regular customers. Also, their employees have all been there for years, so they're obviously treated pretty well by management. 
Always surprised at how cheap their prices are, and always a have good time when I'm there."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been coming here for years now, and have always had a fun time. The bartenders are great at their jobs...it could be packed, and yet there is still very little wait. They demand respect from their patrons  (towards both its employees and other customers) which helps keep out the typical douchy college crowd. If you're looking for a busy bar in Oakland that doesn't put up with sloppy, drunken antics of 21 year olds this is the place for you. Good job, g door!"}
{"text":"Not for me. Typical college bar with typical prices. That said, if I were a freshman in college with a fake ID, this would be ideal. I would find somewhere else if you are older than 21 years old."}
{"text":"Best bar in South Oakland by far. The Bartenders are phenomenal and are really cool people. The beer selection is amazing, with most craft beers around $4.50. If you want to seriously test your billiards skills, this is the place to be. The pool room can have up to 50 people at times just waiting to play."}
{"text":"I'd give it negative stars if I could. Just don't go here. Worst bar in Oakland! I hope it closes down. There is honestly no place where I hate the workers more."}
{"text":"Crappy bar. The bartenders are SO RUDE.  They don't really check Ids though so this is a happenin' spot if you're under 21. Just avoid the vomit in the bathroom."}
{"text":"As far as Oakland bars go, G Door has made its way to the top of my list. While most Oakland bars are almost too crowded to move through on the weekend, G Door is the perfect combination of popular but not too crowded. The atmosphere is fun but not super crazy, the bartenders are speedy and friendly, and there's a window right by the dart boards that connects to Pizza Romano so you can snag some pizza while you're there. They also have three pool tables in the back, and a lot of the people who play there are really good so it makes for a nice competitive game. 

As a singer, my favorite thing about G Door and what got me going there in the first place was their Karaoke Night on Tuesday nights. There's always a great turn out for karaoke, and while most bars hide their karaoke in the corner somewhere where no one is paying attention, G Door has a stage right in the middle of the bar which makes it a ton of fun. Lots of really talented singers have their moment to shine, one guy always does Disney songs and invites guys on stage to do push-ups during \"I'll Make a Man Out of You,\" and by the end of the night even if you're not the singing type, chances are you're either singing along to Piano Man in the crowd or someone's guilted you to get up on stage to do your favorite Backstreet Boys song.

My only complaints are that it can get pretty smoky sometimes if you're not a smoker, and they don't have the best deals on drinks compared to other bars close-by. Their best regular specials are a Bud Light draft for $2.00 or a pitcher for $5.00, or a Leinenkugel Summer Shandy pitcher for $7.50, but I'd rather pay a little more for a better time!"}
{"text":"I love garage door. It's my favorite place to go out in the city, especially on a weekday. Karaoke there is on point. The bartenders are great, and the drinks are cheap. Seen yinz tonight"}
{"text":"Weak, mediocre drinks served by the MOST MISERABLE people on the planet! Truly haven't seen a single smile out of anyone who works there, even after you leave them a great tip. Great place to be if you're a masochist or need a place to sit, be ignored, and smoke a pack of cigarettes. Other than that, not much draw for G Door. Literally every other bar in Oakland is a much more pleasant place to be, which is truly saying something."}
{"text":"As many have already mentioned, the owner of this bar is a condescending asshole who seems to care more exercising his authority than keeping customers. Sadly, my friends and I recently experienced this first-hand. Out entire office was celebrating and event at Garage Door and had likely collectively spent over $300 that evening. While hanging out by the pool tables, the owner came over to single-out and condescendingly berate my female co-worker for sitting with her feet on the pool table and proceeded to kick her out of the bar. When she tried to insist that he was over-reacting and that we are regular customers who frequently spend money there, he told her he didn't need our business and to get out of the bar.

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They do a great job of keeping out the riff-raff. You can smoke in the one section, which is great for some people I guess. Better than a college bar and better than a local dive."}
{"text":"Staff is incredibly rude and often incompetent. I was told to screw off after being served a $15 pitcher of skunked beer. Not even an hour later the bus boy started a fight with my friend and rather than apologizing for his physically and verbally abusive staff member, the owner put me in a chokehold and threw me out the front door. For the love of god, do not support this roided up asshole's establishment."}
{"text":"Frequented this establishment over the last 6 years, and continue coming back. 

Don't be a dick, or a dumbass and you'll get exemplary service from a plethora of drink slingers, especially Rob who makes Monday nights better than Saturday.  

Great music, good atmosphere and friendly service. From a neighborhood dive to a college hot spot depending on the day. 

Come here without expectations and with your ID and you'll have a great night."}
{"text":"This place has great prices and a neat set up but it's always crowded and has a VERY heavy police presence. Now, I'm all for safety but I don't particularly enjoy feeling like a prisoner when downing drinks and playing darts. So three stars it is."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite haunts when I lived in South Oakland as a student.  As a poor undergrad, the specials were excellent.  I played darts with my roommates there every Thursday while they drank $5 pitchers of Bud Light and $2 rum and cokes.  I recently revisited Garage Door with my Pitt buddies, and while I would have given it a 4-star review back in the day, I'd give it less now.  It's decent for a college dive, but doesn't hold up for grad students and beyond."}
{"text":"Smoking bar (in the front I think, but the smoke spreads throughout the entire bar), which is pretty inconvenient if you're not a smoker.
If you're a college student, however, you'll likely run into a classmate, which is always exciting.
The drink specials are ok, but the atmosphere is cool. There's also a lot of bar games that you can play and they've got a stage for karaoke. Generally, it's a good place for a chill night at the bar with friends."}
{"text":"Cheap, smokey, loud.

Good beer selection, a few pool tables, and tons of TVs.

The young college crowd likes to get wasted here.

It can be a fun place."}
{"text":"I know this is primarily a college bar, but if you are like me and not a college goer, I am here to tell you that you can partake and enjoy this place.  But if you want to do so you must follow this one simple rule: Go when there are no college students around.  Yes, it is that simple.  Granted, you will not be able to come to this place and completely not run into college students, but when it is either winter or summer break you will have minimum run in with those college goers.  This way you will be able to have a happy encounter here and not be pushed around.

I have been here years ago when it was elbow to elbow college, but that was when I was younger and in college myself.  My god does that feel like an eon ago, but I digress.  The warmer months are the better ones to visit, that way you get the whole garage door vibe.  The front will be open, garage door style.  This allows a seamless flow of the warm weather to come inside.  The inside is rather large.  You have the general bar area which is circular in nature and gives you ample bar area if that is what you prefer.  Behind the bar area is what I refer to as your general area.  This area consists of tables of both the high and low variety, room enough to dance if you prefer, and a doorway counter to the pizza place next door that you can go and get food (I find this a pretty amazing add on since they do not have a kitchen).  And behind this general area is an adult play area.  In this area is where you would find darts and billiards.  Also, if you need to use the facilities, this is the area where you would find it.

As far as service, it was pretty amazing.  The bartender working was pretty amazing, making sure that we had drinks in front of us and explaining what other drinks consisted of.  As far as drinks, there is more than enough here for you to imbibe in.  There are specials throughout the week and I am fairly sure these specials have changed much since the years I visited long ago.  Jello shots, pudding shots, and pickle vodka standout here.  I suggest trying the salted pretzel pudding shot, surprisingly it actually tastes like a salted pretzel.  I did not partake in the pickle vodka, but maybe next time.

Things to not: smoking is allowed.  Cards are accepted, but they hold them until you are ready to settle your tab (if you want food from next door, they will relinquish your card for a minute or two, but you must hand it back to them, unless you settled that tab).  Beer to go if you prefer to continue your night at home.  They participate in TapTV, an app game that you can play while in the bar."}
{"text":"Owner was a dick to me once, but I got over it.  Fun to play darts during the day and pound pitchers.  Perfect place for post finals fun."}
{"text":"Garage Door is an Oakland staple. Anyone who has ever been a student of Pitt has frequented this local bar. One of the best things about Garage Door is that it not only attracts Pitt students, but also a fair amount of the few local South Oakland residents as well. The crowd is always interesting, the beer is cheap, there's plenty of games, karaoke, and usually enough space to feel comfortable. In the summer when the garage doors are open, it's even better!

They may be a little brash and close minded, but it's their right as a business to treat their customers however they want, I guess... !"}
{"text":"Go on a week day.  I'm stretching things with 4 stars, I'm sure on a weekend it's retard central with Pitt folks... but on a weekday it was EXCELLENT.  Good beer selection, bordering on very good, great prices, MANY DART BOARDS, pool tables, semi-normal crowd (weekday), food till 2:00, hell I should give this place 5 stars.  If you are in the area on a weekday or early weekend it's definitely worth a stop.  If the conditions are right it could be your only stop.  If I went to Pitt I'd be at this place every week, thank god I didn't go to Pitt.  Oh, you can smoke which is a negative for me... but on the positive side the juke box was very good."}
{"text":"$5 pitchers of cheap beer on a Friday night. Hey Pitt students, this place is your dream come true. They also have a literal hole in the wall inside of the establishment where you can order hole in the wall food. The fries were good. If you are a young college kid, you'll love it."}
{"text":"I would probably have given this place a 5 star perhaps back when I was still in college but now, it's not for me. 

I've been here few times during the weekends to catch up with friends who live around the area. The biggest drawback about this place at least for me is the smoke. Besides that, I am okay with the young college crowd and/or the loud music.

The place it self is pretty big. The service .. well.. pretty good for a dive bar. The drinks.. real cheap with quite a good collection of beer! and they do serve food as well.

Also this place has plenty of HDTV along with some pool table and dartboards!! ... one of the main reason I even make an attempt to go back."}
{"text":"Would give this place negative stars if I could. Horrible service. Incompetent and rude bartenders. And they're racist white supremacists. Don't give them your business."}
{"text":"So the bouncer comes up to me one night and yells: \"Don't spit again.\" I guess the guy was stalking me and looking for a reason to throw me out. I told him I wouldn't do it again and thought everything was settled.

I returned a week later and the bouncer takes my ID at the door, scans it, like he's gonna let me in, and tells me I'm banned.

If I did something stupid, I could understand being kicked out of a bar or banned, but spitting on a dirty bar floor once is not one of them. This guy was jealous I usually have a good time with some college cuties at The Garage Door and wanted to ruin my night.

This spot has a good college crowd being right next to Pitt but the staff has a major attitude problem. The two severely tattooed bartenders (one tall blonde and a short brunette) are colder than an ice cube at the morgue. I've never seen either of them smile. I hope this place gets a clue and hires people that treat others with respect or your bar might be on the next episode of Bar Rescue."}
{"text":"Bar owner Mark Papariella defended their \"Wetback Wednesday\" sign a few years ago. Management at Garage Door Saloon is racist. See the hidden Yelp reviews below, plus the anti-Jew behavior of the staff in the indymedia article about them. I recommend boycotting Garage Door Saloon. http://pittsburgh.indymedia.org/news/2008/03/29160_comment.php#29594"}
{"text":"Crowded and smoky, but fun atmosphere as long as you're with a couple friends, great food/drinks, and good music. I've enjoyed a couple of friends' 21sts at this place, a great atmosphere to be in. Came here for St. Patty's Day last year, and it was surprisingly decent-not too crowded at night, though it was a Monday evening. If you love bar hopping, you must check this place out! It's worth it!

Pros: Fun atmosphere, decently priced food and drinks (Pizza Romano's is AMAZING), great place to hang out.

Cons: VERY crowded every weekend, smoking environment"}
{"text":"Depending on the night this bar has a fun mixture of college students, young professionals, and older yinzers. For the most part, everyone is respectful and minds their business. The younger folks do not binge drink here, so you don't have to deal with rowdy crowds like at other local bars.

There are pool tables, music, and TVs for entertainment. Smoking is permitted too. Insider the bar, there is a window to the next door pizza shop, so you don't have to leave for food.

Lastly, and most importantly to me, they have about twenty-five beers on tap none of which I've ever recognized craft. I'm not saying Gdoor never carries beer; I'm saying I've never seen a craft beer that I recognized which is disappointing to me considering all of the local craft breweries. The selection consists of ubiquitous options such as Blue Moon, Guinness, and Redd's."}
{"text":"The owner of the bar has no problem abusing women and physically removing them from the bar and throwing them into the street."}
{"text":"My usual friday night darts hang out spot. Can't beat the cheap pitchers and darts and pool. The bartenders are very nice and friendly as well

Pretty spacial (does get a bit smokey though so clothes might smell like smoke after a while). They do have a decent number of TVs to catch any games that might be on.

People can be hit or miss (I happened to once be there on a night when some lady decided her fries were too hard and decided to break a bottle and attack the bouncer - not the bar's fault in any way).

Food is good too, and cheap (I think it is through the next door pizza place - the chicken ranchero bites are great btw)

Met some cool people playing darts. It isn't as \"undergrady\" as I thought it would be being in the middle of Oakland.

All in all, a decent place to go get some cheap drinks and play darts and pool. Check it out if you get a chance to"}
{"text":"Fun spot to get cheap drinks on a Friday night. My fiance and I went on a bar crawl with some of his law school buddies there. Kinda crowded but fun."}
{"text":"RIP Decade. Oh how I remember the Decade. Well it's been many places since then and now it's Garage Door. My friend Bobby and I met up before the Patti Smith concert and threw back a couple of PBRs before the show. It's a really big space and food isn't sold/served. Though they have a couple of IPA beers available, it's totally a shot and beer kind of joint."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in to grab a beer after hanging out in Oakland all day and were denied service. After reading reviews here I'm glad I didn't spend any money there. Will continue to take my business elsewhere."}
