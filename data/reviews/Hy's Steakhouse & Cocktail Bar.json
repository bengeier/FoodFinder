{"text":"2* isn't an entirely fair representation of the food but it was for the experience. We were here for New Years Eve. There was an $80 prix fixe menu that had great selection - I had french onion soup to start, the filet mignon (medium-rare) for my main, and a creme brulee for dessert. The food was very good, and the bread was phenomenal. However this was NYE and they really missed the mark on making it a special occasion. I've been to other nice steakhouses for NYE before and we got the tiaras and noise makers, and the restaurant did a countdown at midnight with a glass of champagne. We had none of that here - a few noisemakers came out when we made the request. The staff made it clear that they didn't want to be there, it wasn't exactly the special evening we were expecting. 

I also think, with the price point, you're just as well off going to the Keg for your steak dinner."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday night with my boyfriend. We are both steak lovers and normally go to Barberians, but thought we would try a different place. We have both eaten here before and really enjoyed it. This time was a tad different. I was very happy with the appetizers and the salad, also the wine I had was good. However, my steak was a little over cooked (I hate that!!) and part of it tasted AWFUL. Just half which was strange, the first half that I ate was not good at all - so bad that I had to spit it out in my napkin...I told the waitress and all she said was \"sorry\". I had the 10 oz New York steak. 

My boyfriend's steak was okay...he had the porterhouse, but unfortunately it was overcooked as well...

The service was good minus the fact that all we got was a weak \"sorry\" when I told her that half my steak tasted like dirt. 

.......$280 later we were pretty unhappy....back to Barberians we go :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic steaks cooked to perfection. Top notch service and atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I dined at Hys for dinner last week (Friday December 5 2014)

Let's start with the positive... 

The food was delicious,  I had the fillet minon with Gorgonzola,  mash potatoes and brussels sprouts 
I called ahead to inquire about food allergies and the staff were very helpful
The atmosphere was great.
The servers were very friendly
Live entertainment was great 

Needs improvement.. 
Sitting in the bar/lounge (which front of the house said has full service and a full menu)  it took about 15 minutes for someone to take my order 
At dinner time, it took 45 minutes for my steaks to arrive 
My dish came out wrong (not a big deal,  it happens),  but it took another 45 minutes to make me a new one
The second time my dish came out, the brussles sprouts came out plain and tasteles, not caramelized with bacon and shavings of parmigian as the menu described and the mash potatoes were garlic mash potatoes not the plain ones i ordered. The server was  happy to fix it   but it was still annoying given this was not the first thing i had to send back. 
Minor, but would have been nice to have fresh bread served before /with the meal. 

I will go again to see if i have a better experience with the service"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, and service was A+.

The table side caesar salad is so good, along with their steaks.

I recommend this place to anyway looking for a romantic atmosphere, excellent food, and top notch service."}
{"text":"It sure is a high-end steakhouse but the food didn't blow our mind. Great appetizer, the size of the steak was good as well as the seasoning, yummy desserts, and a nice wine. The server Andrew was impeccable.  But for the price you pay (especially the steak), you can easily have the same meal at another place for a decent price. 

Not worth the money and not coming back."}
{"text":"What a complete pleasure to dine at Hys. The service from the moment we walked in to when we left completely full was excellent.  The restaurant itself is a visual treat (we were with an architect and he was so impressed with the decor and layout of the establishment). The server was knowledgable about everything, and explained the beef to us.  The food did not disappoint - I suggest the appetizer platter.  It was so good we could have just ordered more and more!

If you are looking for a top notch dining experience in YYC, Hys is where it is at.  Ben and Angus - you were fantastic. Congratulations on such a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Hy's is rock solid. Steak is perfect. They know what they're doing. Great location. Only downside is my phone tries to correct the name Hy's to a number of random words that don't fit."}
{"text":"Service: From the door man/valet gentlemen, the front desk, the waiter, to even the food runners- FANTASTIC STAFF. Quick, courteous, polite, and accommodating. The SERVICE is top notch but the FOOD...

Food:
We are not steak connoisseurs, we unfortunately had very high expectations for specifically the steaks, we have had our fair share of steaks. Regretfully, the steak is what tainted our rating.

- Creme brulee: Was on the house for our anniversary! Delicious and the cream was VERY fresh!
- Spinach salad: Made at the table- which was nice. Great flavour.
- Twice baked potatoes, onion rings, french onion soup: Ordinary.
- Porterhouse steak: ordered medium rare but received :medium-charred/burnt\" we had high expectations for the steak."}
{"text":"A place to be well dressed and meet with a business associate or the like. The steak and all sides are delicious but fair warning- they WILL continuously refill your complimentary garlic bread basket so you should come in with the strong will to say no more. Otherwise you end up like me and nibble on your steak because you have destroyed 2 bread baskets singlehandedly.

Look out for their twice baked potato that comes with a man and a tray with all of your potato dream garnishes to follow. 

P.s I hear they make a killer banana foster

EDIT: They DO make a mouthwatering, drool worthy Banana Foster"}
{"text":"Awesome steak...
Great atmosphere...
Amazing service....
Shared a number of Appetizers
and the bone in Rib steak
cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"First, terrific service. Our waiter, Jared, was friendly, informative, and attentive without being the least bit intrusive. He provided us with a wine recommendation that we really enjoyed, told us a bit about the restaurant and the food that they serve, and since we ordered two tableside dishes, also finished the preparation of our food.

We opted for the cheesy toast (because cheese and why not), which was a tasty starter; the Caesar salad, which was delicious and fresh; and the Chateaubriand. The meat was delicious, though one of us found the seasoning a little heavy-handed (only on the perfectly seared crust). Vegetables were very fresh and plentiful (a bounty of delicious mushrooms included). The biggest miss was the Béarnaise sauce, which was both over-salted and not the texture I expected (not sure if this was a one-off or just how they typically prepare it.) Luckily, the dish also comes with a demi-glace that was tastier than expected.

The meal was perfectly paced, the atmosphere reserved and elegant without being stuffy, and we enjoyed our meal and evening. We'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"Went with my 2 kids, (19 and 14), for our yearly Christmas dinner.
Simply, I can't imagine how it could have been any better.  For a new space, it already has a great \"classic\" steakhouse feel.  One thing I WILL say is thank god my daughter is too young to drink and my son doesn't like wine...it's not for the faint of heart as far as pricing goes, but that said, it was worth it because of the ambiance, service and perfectly prepared meals."}
{"text":"Very cozy and intimate place. It can get noisy at times(so I've heard). I ordered the salmon and capers plus crème brulee for dessert.(the chef brings you the meal) Both delicious albeit the portion size is quite small. Overall, I would only recommend coming here on a special occasion and/or when you really feel like splurging on a good meal/service."}
{"text":"Old school glamour. High priced menu. Top notch service. You know exactly what you're getting when you go to Hy's. 

The Caesar salad is a must. The Caesar cocktail is a must. The double stuffed potato was incredible. We shared the T-bone steak and the waiter offered to have it cut for us. If I were to go back, I would have not had it cut, as all of the juices had leaked out by the time it came to our table.

Had dinner on a Saturday for our wedding anniversary. I snuck away to tell the hostess that I wanted a little surprise for my husband. They gave us glasses of champagne and a beautiful dessert free of charge.

I would prefer to go to Hy's for a business dinner and expense it. But I have a feeling that I'll be craving the steak and potatoes before that happens."}
{"text":"I have been around Toronto since Hy's first arrive from the West Coast of Canada and certainly I recall very good experiences even though relatively expensive at the time. But I had not been there since they moved from their original location until recently when I have been there twice in the past six months. The atmosphere exudes opulance, portion size and the service is impressive. On the first recent visit, the quality of my filet mignon was not up to my standard. However all was forgiven on the second vist because the daily special of a filet + shrimps was excellent. This may have been because it was a Sunday evening and our group of eight were the only ones in the bar area for pre-dinner drinks and in the large back-room (as per our rquest)."}
{"text":"Hy's Steakhouse is a truly beautiful restaurant... it's ok to have a high end $$$$ restaurant but u actually have to earn it. Steaks tasteless and baked potato were barely warm. Porterhouse steak is very chewy. The Keg is far better food with better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really, this restaurant is outstanding.

The atmosphere is relaxing.  It is a large restaurant on one side of the space and a bar/lounge on the other end. The wait staff were all excellent.

We started with (3) appetizers.  Why not?  There are a lot of rave reviews of the cheese toast.  It was really very good and an excellent value at $9 though for me, there are other items more desirable, but that doesn't diminish it's quality or value.  I would give it 4 stars.  The prawn cocktail was 5 stars.  There wasn't too much horseradish taste that some places have, which can overwhelm the seafood flavor.  Then there was the Cesare salad, also 5 stars.  Prepared at your table for two, it was perfectly balanced for flavor with no single ingredient overwhelming the salad.  (Like one place we were at in Victoria that had so much Tabasco sauce, my lips were burning.  To top off that experience, the waiter/owner made it obvious he deserved a big tip for his creativity.)   

Main course:  The esteemed filet Mignon Chateaubriand.  This was truly perfect.  An outstandingly tender piece of meat that was perfectly medium rare as ordered.  It had a wonderful slightly charred crust and a perfect interior, served with Bearnaise and a beef juice sauce.  The filet was accompanied by button mushrooms, cauliflower, green beans, roast potatoes and a half tomato with cheese.  These were all outstanding.  Not too much spice, crisp and perfectly timed to be the perfect complement to the meat, which is hard for a kitchen to do.  5 stars out of 5?  I'd say 6 out of 5.  

I asked the waiter to hold off on the dessert as we were very full.  He patiently gave us an hour and then we had bananas foster.  I found the sauce a little intense just on the bananas alone and definitely better with the ice cream.  If I ordered it again, I'd ask for extra ice cream.  The restaurant kindly donated the dessert to our anniversary celebration.  Thanks so much!

We've been to quite a few steak houses.  This is the first one that really hit a home run on everything served."}
{"text":"I think Hys is overrated.  We ordered the signature Premium Black Angus,Beef Wellington and the Filet Mignon. The Wellington was small and not rich in taste; in fact, quite ordinary. The Black Angus was good but not as amazing as it was featured and for the price.  Filet Mignon was tasty and the best among all.  What disappointed me the most was that the server dropped the banana on the table as he was making the Banana Foster beside our table and put it back into the dessert making. I was shocked by the act at such a top-rated restaurant.."}
{"text":"Had an amazing special anniversary dinner here with m honey ! portions are large, as is sot be expected...prices are large of course. But with such amazing steaks and service, it's a very special treat you gotta try! 



DRINKS:
we shared a bottle of wine.. extensive wine list so pretty easy to find something you would enjoy- at the bar we had a cocktail afterward which was delicious- though I forget which one ! 
FOOD: 
I recommend tableside caesar salad.  Was so much fun to watch our server do everything from scratch right beside us, and so quickly ! He was no novice. cool to see! and delicious ... from someone who tends not to eat caesar salad. Dressing was nice and not super creamy, which I much prefer! 
Ahi tuna starter was delish as well-- comes with tarot root chips which were great to scoop the tuna-- nice and healthy and light which I love


Steak of course is the highlight - my medium rare sirloin was outstanding ! perfectly cooked.....took some home because 8 oz is too much for me still

The server was nice to bring me half order of some bernaise sauce on the side because he could tell I really wanted to try it ! 

the baked potato accompaniment was yummy too and we also shared a half portion side order of brussels sprouts and mixed veggies 

My BF had steak with some crab meat and a yummy sauce... so rich but so good ! 

we opted to not have dessert, but the cheesecake was calling me ! 

ATMOSPHERE:  LOVE the gorgeous high ceilings, dark intimate atmosphere and very large tables...cozy booths.... so warm and inviting!
We stayed in the lounge area after for some live music which was lovely and nice and relaxed too 

SERVICE:  We had a great server. very experienced.... they are a little \"Stiff\" here so to speak but with a very wealthy customer base I am sure they have to be pretty proper and on their game. overall was great service though!! No complaints

Overall a great night , lovely experience and amazing food !"}
{"text":"Took a client here for dinner as it's his favourite restaurant and I've always wanted to give it a try.  I have to say Hys is definitely one of the best steak houses in Toronto.

Great food, great service, and great value (probably because we only had one glass of wine each)!"}
{"text":"Located in a heart of Toronto's Financial District, hands-down the classiest steak I have had in a while. Among assortment of suits and furs, great food with much more than \"whole nine yards\" list of cocktails to complement your night out. 
Pricey - yes, worth it? - absolutely.
The atmosphere of both dining room and the bar is relaxing, complete with good service and friendly guests. Have dined there a few times and will be back there again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, staff, and vibe. Best Old Fashioned in the city. I recommend the Steak Neptune. Also the garlic bread. Can't miss!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service we received was pretty good. Everyone was professional.

The NY strip steak and lobster was cooked fairly well. Steak - aged 28 days no spices to hide the flavours. It was good. Lobster - tender and it was oh so sinful with side of melted butter. Yummy! 

Unfortunately the rest of the meal didn't fare so well. 

Our potatoes sides were a disappointment!  We had ordered two types: the double baked (which are mashed potatoes, put back into the shell then baked again) and garlic mashed. They were both dry and salted to death. The same goes with the cream corn extremely salty. Ok if you were wanting a salt lick.  At this point I didn't feel like sending it back. 

Caesar salad - No care in the prep of these overly drenched romaine leaflets.

Garlic toast  - It's garlic toast. Keg Mansion back in the day (15+ years ago), used to serve fresh sour dough buns with whipped butter. Now that was amazing! 


My takeaways and tips, 

You pay a huge premium to be sitting at Hy's. Food tasted like the Keg and there happens to be one around the corner! 

Some background on my steaking I've been south of the border to the land of steaks. New York, Texas, N.S. Carolina, Florida, Missouri. The best steak I've had is at the Plaza III in Kansas City, MO est '63,  Zagat rated one in KC, and 1 of the top 10 steak places in USA. 
 
Hy's has a great atmosphere for either a date or a power business meeting. The restaurant uses incandescent lighting thankfully and plenty of  available types of seating: along the edge booths, separate tables, or private booths. There's an upper floor as well. The restaurant is very clean, no strange odors. The ceilings are sky high with impressive wood paneling. Bar area is quite nice, huge lion mural as the backdrop and nearby the pianist.  
It seems the further one walks into the restaurant the darker it becomes.

Furniture requires some reworking. The upholstery and carpets needs repair (carpet areas  worn through to the floor in the foot areas, and seat backs worn in, cherry furniture scratched up, needs some re-staining. Ironically the hostess mentioned that they just had a meeting about doing a refresh.

Strongly advise you not to sit in the booths (where we were originally brought) unless you want yourself to feel constricted like a child in a high chair waiting for a happy meal. The seat cushions are so soft your rear end sinks and your legs fly up like you're ready for take off in a 747.

Good wine selections from California, Australia, Chile, Argentina, Spain, France, and Italy.

Perhaps I'll order something other than the steak next time like the fried chicken yeah I know sounds strange but you never know until you try. 

Cool place with some history, but you gotta be very selective to where you sit and what you order."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, fine food. 
We always get treated here once a year. I can't comment on the price as I wasn't treating. But the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful steak, it seemed to take a long time to cook tho.  Well seasoned and perfectly cooked medium rare.  Nice marbling in the meat.  It is a pricey place, $60 for a 20 oz bone in rib steak. Service was attentive.  Always liked Hy's but the price is prohibitive."}
{"text":"I went here with a girlfriend for dinner one night expecting a nice relaxing time with no problems but wouldn't you guess a place that is supposed to be known for their steaks screwed up on what else? Lol, yes the meat! 

From the looks of the place walking in, I was impressed, very luxurious, high ceilings, and a calm ambience. Upon being seated, we were given a few minutes to look over the menu. She ordered a porterhouse and I ordered a filet mignon both with mashed on the side. For appetizers we ordered oysters rockerfeller, and for extra sides, mushrooms and gorgonzola mac & cheese.

The oysters and mushrooms were fine, nothing to rave about, the gorgonzola mac & cheese was so-so, I would not order that again. Then came our steaks, I had ordered mine rare and I thought it was really good, my friend ordered it medium rare and it came out bloody, so it had to be sent back, when it came back it was too burnt, when I asked for new mashed for my friend because there was blood all over it from the initial steak they were hesitant at first to give a new one. Seriously? Cheaping out on some mashed potatoes? When you go there preparing to pay premium prices? Honestly, I was peeved!! After the second hit-and-miss, the waiter sent for an entirely new steak, all the while my steak got cold waiting for my friends to arrive. For dessert we shared a creme brûlée, and although good, nothing memorable.

Overall the service was good, we had 3 waiters attending to us, and except for one that was hesitating over the request for new mashed potatoes. I like the service and decor but food was subpar, wouldn't want to return and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience dining at Hy's Steakhouse this past weekend.  We had an early reservation so it was pretty quite during the meal.  The wine list is accessed by a tablet left on the table which allows for several different search options of a very extensive selection.  Without the search options it would be difficult to navigate through to find what we were looking for.  As an appetizer we split the oysters which were amazing.  My favorite part was the fresh shaved horse radish that accompanied the dish.  For our entrees my wife and I both had the bone in Rib Eye medium rare.  We often find that many chefs have difficulty accommodating our customized requests for preparing our steaks but this chef did it perfectly.  We like them prepared Pittsburgh style with a small amount of Bleu or Roquefort cheese melted on top.  They were charred perfectly and still achieved the perfect red medium rare center.  The sides (we had garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms) were delicious as was the creme brulee for dessert.  

Last but definitely not least was the outstanding service.  Our server extremely knowledgeable and friendly and not over bearing at all which I often find in upscale restaurants.  

I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the Toronto area, very close to the Royal Alexandra Theatre so great for an after show meal!"}
{"text":"Born and bred Calgarian, I can't help but love Alberta beef. And to get quality meat, you have to go to quality places like Hy's.

This place is always busy so you know it's good. Their menu notes that their cheese toast is famously irresistible and they're not lying! The oogy googy garlicky cheese toast will remind you why you love carbs and cheese so much.

Their steak salad is really hearty - the char on the steak is a nice touch to the tenderness and the light vinaigrette on the salad lets the steak shine through on this dish. 

Hy's strives for perfection, in quality of their food and service. Experience it yourself, you won't be disappointed - trust me!"}
{"text":"Went there for my first time birthday dinner. I love the high ceilings, big chairs, and the service was fantastic. With a great radio or voiceover voice, the waiter took our order and made things right when there was a slight mix-up in the doneness of a steak. 

The atmosphere of the place and the menu is very old-school, but it works. It's got the standard steak-house menu items with not much originality but it all works for what it is. 

And, I'd probably agree with Bart, better with a corporate card, but what steakhouse isn't like that?"}
{"text":"Classics are classics and few steakhouses do it better than Hy's! Food is awesome I had Filet a la Hys done to perfection with a bottle of delicious Belle Glos Pinot Noir. Server Kim was perfect, sat a table in lounge, ambience is great!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service with high quality food. You most certainly get what you pay for. The beef wellington was the best i've ever had, it literally melts in your mouth! The servers knowledge on the food was very helpful as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a three star review but there is potential on my next visit to upgrade it to a four or five star review. Curious? Keep reading...

I love steaks. Living in Canada, there are a lot of choices for great steaks so I don't want this review to be about how the steaks at Hy's are any better than anywhere else on a flavour basis. It is AS good, which is a compliment to Canada's while steakhouse industry. For me, it's \"table steaks\" to not-so-cleverly make a pun out of an old saying. Having said that, there are things that I do judge a steakhouse on: atmosphere, appetizers, and service. So let's get started.

For atmosphere I was impressed right from the get-go. The massive doors remind me inevitably of the black doors of Mordor in the lord of the rings, and walking inside it has the look and feel of an upscale dining experience. Warm lighting, scores of books on shelves, live acoustic guitar music. Our table was in a book upstairs that felt like being in a private room.

For apps, I had the French onion soup. Rich broth, about as thick as French onion soup can get, lots of cheese (especially Parmesan). Delicious. A friend at the table ordered the Caesar salad. The server brought out a kiosk and made it at the table. I love when they do that.

The steak was of course very good. I subbed potatoes with vegetables, which included broccoli Brussels sprouts carrots and green beans. All fresh and well coloured (I don't know why I care so much about the brightness of my vegetables but dammit I do!)

For the most part the service was good. Friendly staff who knew the menu and could make recommendations.

So why only 3 stars and not 4 (or even 5)? Well, it comes down to what may seem like a small thing but for me is not. The first thing on the menu is a cheese bread item that is their speciality shareable, and when we asked about it the server also really did a great job of selling us on it so we ordered it. But then it didn't come. When the steaks came out we inquired and was told it would be right out but instead we just got the regular garlic bread. I know it seems very small (and they didn't put it on the bill by accident, which was the right call) but for a steakhouse of such repute, and specifically because the restaurant promotes this one item so well, I just thought it was a bit odd, even if it might have been a rare miss for them (judging from everything else I suspect it was).

I almost never write a review anticipating that I will come back and update but in this case I almost certainly will."}
{"text":"Cheese toast and the Cesar salad made right at your table are a must .... I have been to the whistler, Calgary and Vancouver location many times and I'm never disappointed ! Great service great food ... If your in Vancouver ask for Blair he is an amazing waiter"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!! The steaks are to die for and just get the onion rings...they are the best you will ever have."}
{"text":"April 27 2017 my table was on the main floor washrooms are upstairs. Tables are close and the noise level prevents conversation. I order roast beef medium my favourite with a side order of asparagus . The beef was so tough I was unable to cut it. The asparagus was cold. A large round bun of bread looked great but when pulled apart  was steaming hot and streched like from a micro wave oven. After waiting to speak to my waiter for awhile I asked another waiter to have my beef replaced. My water returned and brought another roast beef this time it was reasonably tender but very little flavour. There are many choices in Toronto I would NOT be back to this very disappointing one."}
{"text":"A friend visited from the UK a few years back, and I decided to splurge on a trip to Hy's. I'd never been there before, but the stellar reviews led me to believe it was a good choice. 

The food was good - but not worth its price tag. There are so many other places in the financial district that are just as pricey with far better food and service. (Canoe is but one example- plus you get an awe-inspiring view.) 

As to the decor and atmosphere... it felt very Alice in Wonderland - and not in a good way. It was like being trapped in a deep dark crypt where all the ugly furniture is deposited because it's too hideous for the light of day. The oversized everything was totally ridiculous and the staff was equally useless. I'm rarely harsh towards wait-staff, but I'm certain that it wasn't their fault. I blame the owner and/or management. It seemed as though our waiter was paid by a hourly rate instead of tips or commission. 

*Note to waiters: Ensure you have a personality before entering the trade.

*Note to management: Ensure you are able to deliver on your hype."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to visit our favorite downtown Toronto Restaurant & Bar last night. What a great fun evening of fantastic food, drinks and company. We had the large 18 ounce NY steak, broiled tomatoes & jumbo shrimp cocktail. The steak was perfectly cooked. Even thought the lounge area was very busy our bar service was never delayed thanks to Raimy, Mike and Beth who took time to pour us one as well. A special thanks to Paul the piano man for playing \"chestnuts roasting on an open fire\" :-)Keep up the great service, food and ambiance Manager Mike and thank you"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Hy's for 25 plus years, from Hawaii to Calgary, Barb has always been a gracious host. And the food has always been wonderful."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance , great Waite staff and awesome decor 

Great wine selection and reasonably priced 

For starters we had the table side caesar salad , calamari and brussel sprouts

For our mains we got the porter house and the strip loin cut into pieces as there was only 3 of us, meat was a little overdone to my liking, we had asked for medium and we received medium well, tasty non the less  

When you are looking for an evening out in this price range this wouldn't be my first choice but if you haven't been give it a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The idea of having an expensive, once in a while dinner far outweighed the actual experience. 

We both had the table side Caesars to start (which were very good), however we just couldn't get over how dark the booths were: almost to the point of squinting to ready our menus. A table would have been better in hind sight.

Our night continued and with our mains in front of us we cut into the meat (lamb for the lady and rib eye for me). Although it was too dark to get a good look at my steak it felt medium-rare and it was very enjoyable, the baked potato was also good. Across the table however, it was a different story. My girlfriend ordered her lamb cooked medium which is standard, but it was difficult to cut through because it was raw in the centre. Almost cold to touch. Even in the dark it was noticeably a deep purple colour. We had our waiter take it back to get cooked longer, and he offered to take my meal back so we could eat together. Gladly I said no to this as it took 13 minutes (we waited and counted) to come back. What would have happened to my steak in that time I wonder?

Now this happens occasionally, and we were upset, but had it not been for the way they reacted afterwards it would have been forgiven without issue, but we had our waiter, apologise halfheartedly, Jimmy who made our Caesar salads apologise, and someone who we assumed was the manager halfheartedly apologise. They all then returned to make sure it was cooked to how it was supposed to be. It was in such a way that made us feel wrong for saying something. 

We have had this happen in the past at places such as the Keg, and Wildfire, and both times felt a sincere apology, even a complimentary desert. At Hy's it was swept under the rug. Poorly handled, and we will never return.

The Keg is 1/3 the cost and we enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"Expected a lot more than we got! High prices for service that was just ok at best. Escargot was good, French onion soup was terrible. My husband loved his steak, but the plating was very boring nothing special. We have been to many Steakhouses and there are plenty of better choices than Hy's. We expected over the top service, didn't get that at all, there was just no wow factor here. Hy's better step it up or lower their prices!! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"A fantastic establishment in atmosphere, ambiance, food, service and everything else. We requested to be seated by the windows (as I find this restaurant to be too dark for my taste) and it was granted. The wine/alcohol menu is on an iPad, so that was pretty neat and intuitive to navigate along with categorizing in wine taste (fruity, dry, smooth, sweet, etc). As I am not familiarized on the types of wine, this helped me decided to choose a wine. 

The service was great in presentation, manners, form and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered the Calamari & Jalapeno as starters, and it was amazing. The lightly battered chic pea flour gave a unique texture, taste; without overcooking the calamari and the portion sizes were enough for 2 people. As for the main, we both ordered Filet Mignon (with baked potato) except one of the order was a Gorgonzola Filet Mignon. Both of the items were amazing and the difference between the 2 Filet Mignon was the size of the meat, the Gorgonzola being smaller. Finally, we had an Apple Crumble for dessert and it was great. 

Overall, a special occasion worth every penny for the experience. I would go back for more, but not for a long while."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Magnicifent place. Especially the staff were very friendly and nice. Enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, however the service was seriously lacking. We came to celebrate a birthday and did a great amount of research before booking a restaurant to celebrate. Upon reservation and with the hostess my fiancé made sure to say this was for a birthday. There was no acknowledgment even though others in the restaurant received special recognition of birthdays. 

We would not come back here for a celebration or for dinner. Felt ignored by our server, but other tables were getting plenty of attention. We literally had to put our hand up and yell excuse me for assistance. I don't know if this had to do with the face that we are from the states or that we are in our 30?? Really disappointing service. Definitely would not recommend again. Maybe for take out??"}
{"text":"Some of the best steaks in the city, in a classical yet elegant steakhouse setting.  Lunch is also great - try their beef dip sandwich.  Top notch."}
{"text":"Wonderful old feel steak house in downtown Calgary. Table side Caesar salads and steak Diane were amazing. Servers are attentive, on point, and know their stuff. Have been there twice now and will always go back when I'm in the city, and have the time. HUGE wine list with everything for the economical supper to the highest end connoisseur.  They also have some of the great old prohibition age cocktails that seem to have been lost through the decades. A little pricy for everyday dining, but make no mistake, it's worth the cost."}
{"text":"Made reservations here on a Saturday night for 7pm?  Greeted immediately.  I would guess the place was 30% full.  A rainy night may have had something to do with that.  Long, narrow, dark, cozy, elegant atmosphere.  We had a semi-private booth...one of many along a full side wall.

Good service.  Attentive and friendly enough where I never questioned it.

Filled up on the free mixed bread basket with oil & vinegrette.  

Very good Caesar salad, standard style.  Portion would be enough for a lunch. Just right for a dinner appetizer.  It was prepared a distance away from our table by a fireplace.

According to the other in my party, it was a very good New York striploin, medium well.  Came with very good garlic mashed potatoes & roasted veggies side.

Good almondine chicken for myself.  The breast itself was very filling and just juicy enough, with the same garlic mashed and veggies on the side.

I don't see their drink menu online but I ordered a bottle of white wine in the $40-ish range which was decent.  

We were much too full for dessert unfortunately.

Would I go back?  I have since then become vegetarian, so if they offer an option, definitely I would."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best steak I've had. When you come to a place of this caliber you should be able to expect a steak cooked to order.  I'd give them one more shot I suppose since the rest of the meal was good. Not great but completely fine. The atmosphere is dark and rich and on this night the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house, with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.

We started with the Famous Cheese Toast, oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare, which was made table side and served with small biscuits.

We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.

Our server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.

The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.

In conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg."}
{"text":"Last week, I was looking for different options for a holiday gathering that could accommodate a party of 10.  I emailed Hy's Steakhouse and a few others and within minutes, not only did Hy's Steakhouse have a table for us, but they booked us without confirming.  I don't know if I liked or disliked this approach, it was proactive, yet pushy.  Regardless, this is where we ended up.  

Food
Appetizer - Black and Blue Ahi Tuna
It was ok, although I must say that whatever it was crusted with, it was overpowering.  Perhaps it's just my taste buds as I've eliminated a lot of salt out of my diet, so whenever I taste it, it's very noticeable.  

Entrée - 20oz Bone-In Rib Steak w/ Baked Potato 
This steak was very flavourful, partially due to the cut of the meat and partially because our server suggested to us to have it cooked \"Chicago Style\" where the outside of the steak is caramelized with the fatty parts of the meat and the inside can be cooked to my choosing which was medium rare.  The outside turned out to be a bit more charred than caramelized, but for me it was still edible.  The baked potato was nice, ample toppings chives, butter, sour cream and real bacon bits were available as desired. 

Service
Overall, general service was fine, but the server's attitude and tone was porous which is inexcusable.  I expected more from a place that charges these prices.  Perhaps, it was the fact that we had a large party and the server was automatically getting 18% gratuity so he didn't need to watch what he did.  To be fair, he did offer and did take a group photo of us when it looked like we were having difficulty.

A couple of incidents that happen during our time at Hy's Steakhouse that were noteworthy:
I was ¾ done with my beer, the server asked if I'd like another, I politely declined. 5 minutes later, the server comes back and takes away my drink and put another beer in front of me.  (I didn't take a sip since the last time he spoke to me). I waited a few seconds to see if he would notice that I didn't order this, it passed so I said \"I didn't ask for another one\", he replied with \"Relax\" in a condescending tone and took the drink away.  The issue here is obviously the tone, but also, why would you take my drink away if I wasn't finished and I didn't order another one?

When we asked for our bills, we requested that we'd like separate bills.  He seemed a bit peeved when we asked for that and replied with \"well, why didn't you ask for at the beginning?\"  Sure, we could have been proactive and told you up front, but you also could have been proactive and asked us as well. He ultimately was able to split up our bills, although there were a extra items added on a few of the bills and incorrect items.  We had to dispute, and ultimately we got those items altered/removed from our bills.

Coming from someone who's worked in a restaurant before, I can sympathize with the server.  Larger tables are usually a bit more troublesome and perhaps he's had a bad day.  However, I don't believe the tone that he used was proper.  I'm not asking to be treated like the Queen of England but I did not enjoy the attitude   I will not come back here after this experience.  Food was fine, service was not.  Maybe we'll just stick to The Keg, this would never happen to us there."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! If you want a good piece of steak definitely come and you will not be disappointed. I do recommend sitting at the bar, Rob makes one of the best old fashions, him and Travis definitely are one of the reasons why I keep coming back. Steak salad at lunch is one of my favorite items on the menu along with their famous cheese toast. If you have room for dessert their key lime pie is also quite tasty."}
{"text":"Had a really nice end of year Christmas work dinner here this year. The restaurant is what you expect from a high end old-school downtown steakhouse: over-the-top wood and leather decor, excellent service (literally every single person you walk past will greet you), and good if not surprising steakhouse food.
The meal started with baskets of cheesy garlic toast. Nothing exceptional here, but hey it's still garlic bread: hard to go wrong. For an appetizer I had a wedge salad: it's basically a giant wedge of iceberg lettuce covered in blue cheese dressing and bacon chunks. It's pretty great and between that and the garlic bread I was more full than I should've been going into the main. Haha.
For the main course I just went for a straight up filet mignon. It was tender, cooked to order perfectly and impressive. The veggies and mashed potatoes on the side were also well done. Their were a couple of sauces that came with the meal and the house sauce is pretty tasty, but nothing really needed it.
The key lime pie for dessert was a little disappointing, flavour just seemed a little off, but I need to stop ordering key lime pie when I'm outside of south Florida...it never compares.  
Nice high-end choice for a business meeting or formal dinner, but not really to my tastes for a date place...unless you're trying to do a 'Hey I'm a dude that's about to spend A LOT of money on you to impress, but has no imagination'-date."}
{"text":"While I was tentative about coming here because some of the reviews I have read haven't been great, I'm glad I did! Not going to lie, originally I planned to go to Jacob's & Co. for my birthday dinner but they were completely booked out for the evening, so we settled. But what a fabulous place! If you're looking for atmosphere, they've got it! If you're looking for a really great old school steak, they've got it! The service was exemplary, and the table side act (beef tartar, ceasar salad, and bananas foster) was just marvelous. We had a plethora of appetizers (escargot, cheese toast, french onion soup, oysters rockefeller) all of which were excellent. My 32oz. black angus bone in rib eye with a side of onion rings and creamed spinach was delicious  (I highly recommend it). Thank you Hy's for a memorable birthday, and I will be certain to come back soon."}
{"text":"I first heard (or read) the name Hy's before I left for Toronto when I was researching places to go for a nice dinner. I read about a handful of places and ultimately settled on Hy's due to the location and its relative proximity to my hotel, but do not discount that it was one of the more highly-praised steakhouses in Toronto according to my online research and conversations with the concierge. 

The restaurant itself was nice inside, but as I was traveling alone I contented myself to sit at the bar. This was a great decision because I had good conversation with the other patrons and the bartender and there was a man playing piano in the bar. And I still had access to the full menu.

The Sautéed Garlic Shrimp were a good appetizer, but expensive. I got four shrimp for $17, which I will shrug off and say that any appetizer in a downtown area will be pricey. 

The Bone-In Rib Steak (which I believe to be Canadian for Ribeye) was my main course. It might be the AAA Alberta beef used, but the steak was not impressive. And the chefs didn't help when they over salted it. It even came with a side of mashed potatoes, which were UNDER-seasoned and I felt that if I ate them together they might balance but there was still too much salt. 

I was hoping that the saving grace would be the Thick Cut Beer Battered Onion Rings, which looked more like donuts than onion rings. I love fried food, and a nice thick batter on an onion ring excites me. And they were good, though an order is too much for one person to finish alone. 

This was my first steakhouse in Canada, so maybe this is what I should expect. Or maybe the restaurant's food is on the decline like its attendance - the bartender told me that the place used to do a lot more business. Then again, maybe if they were less heavy-handed with the salt more people would go to Hy's in Toronto. 

Overall the place was decent. The food I ordered was average, but the garlic toast that comes to the table was divine. I would say that the garlic toast was worth the trip alone, and it was fantastic dipped in the sauce left over on my shrimp plate. But next time I'm in Toronto and I want a good steak I will try someplace new."}
{"text":"I use to work at Hy's before they moved to their current location. Yes, that was a while ago.  Back in the day it was the place to be seen and the service and quality was top notch. I visit the new location from time to time for the memories and I can tell you, it isn't what it used to be.  First impression is good, but once you sit at your table it goes downhill fast.  It's still a good steak, but not the best in town. they wait on you like it should be YOUR pleasure and nothing is done with pride. I don't want to write anymore as it requires too much negativity to continue.  It's not a totally disappointment but it's not what it used to be."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - a good old fashion steakhouse with excellent service and comfortable / relaxing atmosphere. 

Service was excellent and attentive. Drink orders were taken immediately, water was refilled quickly, food / wine recommendations were provided and the servers checked in multiple times to ensure all was good. 

I started with the oysters which were good but the sauces / horseradish accompanying the oysters were rather plain and flavourless. One/six oysters was not shucked properly. I must admit they do have a good cheese garlic bread - give it a try.

I thought the fillet mignon cut was excellent - packed with flavour and cooked exactly as I requested - perfectly medium rare. The steak was clearly the highlight of the evening. 

Unfortunately the sides were not of the same quality. The baked potato was average at best. I asked for all the toppings but the portions were minimal (I think I had 4-5 chives at most!). The mega sized onion rings were OK but nothing special. The side asparagus was served cold.

The restaurant decor / atmosphere screams old school steakhouse - lot's of dark woods, black leather, tables of all sizes, multiple booth styles and private dinning rooms.  

Not sure how quickly I will return. Although the steak and service were excellent, the sides were not up to par. If I'm paying these prizes, I would prefer to go to Jacobs were the whole meal is equally excellent.

{"text":"First of all, did you know that you can buy Hy's giftcards at Costco? $150 worth for $120! A few of us went in on this deal, and it worked out splendidly.

Hy's is a classic dimly lit, high-ceilinged, manly decorated steakhouse. Sure, it's in the base of steel and glass office tower, but you'd never know once you're inside. It's in the financial district, so there is the usual assortment of suits. but don't let this deter you -- it's one of the best steakhouses in the city.

For steak, I would recommend the bone-in rib steak. It's pricey, but it's a great cut and a good size. For starches, I love the garlic mash. And don't forget the sides! The onion rings, grilled asparagus and the brussels sprouts (with parm and bacon!) were all delicious. 

For drinks, they make great Manhattans, but they are a bit pricey. The beer list was ok, but nothing spectacular.

The service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I have the emence pleasure of eating at this magnificent Steakhouse for my birthday. Not only were we greeted with a truly wonderful professional Manager Paul, but  the amazing and  top notch server Julie went above and beyond. All the staff are kind the food was to die for and they brought my desert with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on my plate. We WILL BE BACK. Thank you so very much for making my birthday dinner experience the best."}
{"text":"I had an underwhelming dinner here last Saturday. 

I selected Hy's because I haven't had steak in a while and I'd never been to this Toronto classic. I don't think I'll be back.
The space is very nice, though the lighting is almost too dim. The service was excellent. The food was just ok. 

We had: 

Caesar salad - 3/5 this is prepared table side, and is not as tasty as I would have liked. This is not a creamy caesar, but a caesar vinaigrette made with a base of anchovy paste, some tobasco and Worcester, an egg and some red wine vinegar. The server who prepared it was lovely, the salad was a bit on the fishy side for my taste. 

Filet mignon for 2 with vegetables (prepared table side) - 3/5. I felt the steak was bland. I liked the vegetables. But if you're not into eating healthy, you won't. I think they were steamed. 

Creamed spinach - 5/5 this was perfection! 

We didn't have desert. 

I had a drink in the lounge and it was lovely. Large comfortable chairs, great lounge singer. 

All in all I had a very nice time at Hy's, but when i factor in the food and the prices, I can not give this more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"The steak here is sooooo nice! I love the soup of the day as well. If they ask you whether you want backed mushroom, please order it! The service is nice and friendly! Recommend here!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, old-school banker vibe to the place. Servers a well trained, just what you would expect in a place of this caliber. Food itself isn't that special, I've had better steaks for cheaper. I guess your paying for the name, location, ambiance. Definitely a place to take a client or have a business meeting, but other than that you can have a better steak elsewhere."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Hy's is the best steakhouse in Calgary. Service is always excellent and the fare rarely disappoints. I come here quite frequently and my only gripe is with the fact that my steaks are often done a notch less than what I order them as. It isn't a huge concern as I now stick to ordering medium in lieu of medium rare, but can be off putting at times."}
{"text":"I recommend other places if you're looking for service and good steak. Last night I took my girlfriend there for her birthday, and we were unimpressed -- especially for a $300+ dinner for two. We went for the chateaubriand and by comparison, we think the same steak is far better at Barberians Steakhouse (we went there recently for a similar dinner). The steak at Barberians was more tender and not sinewy. What's worse was the service this evening at Hy's. While the restaurant wasn't super busy, we sat around waiting for service - dragging our dinner from 8:30 to almost 11. It was good to start, then the table staff service went downhill after the main course. If anything, I believe you're paying more for the setting. Go for that if that's your thing."}
{"text":"We were invited to Hy's by our friends.  The service was good and the server was very pleasant but the food was less then average.  I do not eat meat and steak often but when I do, my experience is that most high end restaurants make amazing steaks and meat, especially those who claim to specialize in it.

The signature Caesar Salad tasted like mustard with oil, and the steak tartar did too.  I had a Duck Confit for the main and it was dry, chewy and super salty. The potato pure was dry and tasteless. 

To summarize, Hy's was established in 1955 and the food is from the same era.  I am sure that they have their niche and attract their customers who like tradition.  I believe that food needs to evolve and that especially applies to restaurants that charge 50 -60 dollars for the main course. 

My guess is that Hy's can't attract good chefs because they leave no space for creativity and imagination. I love giving good reviews because I know that running a restaurant is a tough business but honest reviews make our restaurants better, right?!

I hope that my review will help both, the restaurant and the people who may, at least for now, find much better food elsewhere.  Unless things change, Hy's  to me is an expensive restaurant with glorified pub food."}
{"text":"I leave this restaurant with a noticeably lighter wallet every time but it never disappoints.  I love Hy's!!  Everything I try is excellent - even the cheese bread is magic!The steaks are always tender and cooked to perfection.  On the last visit I had the mac n cheese which was easily some of the best ever."}
{"text":"Steak was excellent as usual! But I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was quite unimpressed with the desserts. I swear I've had the bananas foster before, but I'm not sure in which city...I thought I had it at the Toronto location. But when I had it recently, it was nothing like I had remembered. Yes it was flambéed, but it was swimming in an orange citrus sauce that was much too strong in flavor taking the emphasis away from the banana. Then the scoop of ice cream was placed in said sauce, melting very quickly then topped with an orange zest that had been soaking in a stronger version of this citrus sauce. What I thought it had been was a dish with flambéed bananas, caramelized to a correct sweetness, no sauce, sitting on a dry plate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side to compliment. I was looking forward to the bananas foster from my memories, but alas, maybe I am thinking of the wrong restaurant :( The cheesecake was okay, and the key lime pie was okay as well. Nothing that blew me away, or maybe I was too sad over the bananas foster that my taste buds were affected. But like I said, steak was excellent, my next visit will be more meat and no dessert."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Hy's in as many years. On this occasion, as on the first, my impression was... meh. The restaurant itself is quite nice, what you would expect from a traditional, high end, steak house.

I had the New York, rare. It came rare, which is great. It also came with the fat cap completely untouched. I mean, not even an attempt at a sear; not the way to cook a New York in my opinion. The waiter suggested this was how they were always cooked. I've cooked (and eaten) my fair share of New Yorks - I'm not sure I recall ever getting a New York with the fat cap completely untouched.

The waiter also served us a bottle of wine a vintage year off of what we ordered and said absolutely nothing about it (he also dripped wine on the table on every pour he made)."}
{"text":"If you want great service, good food and a dining experience that you won't regret? Get to Hys steakhouse, it's not cheap but it's worth it. 

Came for my birthday and almost had a heart attack when the banana foster was flambe'd in front of me. I didn't feel worthy especially after the steak and fixings we just had.
I was overwhelmed with how good everything was and just loved our waiter he was knowledgeable and made recommendations which again I live for. Literally. I'm Coming back for my birthday again this year"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.

Fried Calamari and Jalapeño Peppers...5 Stars.  The calamari and jalapeños were lightly coated in the chickpea flour.  The calamari was nice and tender.  They didn't have that crispy shell but still tasted very good...credit that to the meaty bite-sized rings (kudos to Hy's for selecting great specimens).  The raita dip was a nice compliment.  My only gripe is that I wished there were more pieces of fried jalapeños.

Braised Pork Belly...5 Stars.  Perfectly braised pork belly with a quick flash on the grill for even more flavor.  Fork tender and melts in your mouth.  The housemade steak sauce was excellent; savory smooth!

Caesar Salad...5 Stars.  Prepared from scratch table side.  Doesn't get any better than that. Aromatic freahly grated parmesan cheese with a lovely light dressing.

Beef Wellington...5 Stars.  The tenderloin was perfectly cooked; tender, juicy bites.  The foie gras and oyster mushroom duxelle added loads of flavor, as well as, the buttery puff pastry.  Just an excellent dish and execution.  

Pistachio Creme brulee...4 Stars.  The custard had the perfect consistency but was a bit light on the vanilla bean flavor."}
{"text":"I received a call from the restaurant manager today (ironically, at the same time my bestie and I were discussing the incident) about my review.  She wanted to assure me that Hy's treat all diners with respect and would never judge anyone in any way.  While I do not want to add anything else to my lunch incident, I appreciate that Hy's actually takes time to read customer reviews and take them into consideration.  We were also invited to have lunch at the restaurant again where it was unexpected, but definitely appreciated.  Thank you Hy's for standing behind your reputation for exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Hy's has fast become a go-to spot for business lunches and dinner events.  We love the staff!  The service is spot-on, and food is always delicious.  Special shout-out to Charmaine, who works meticulously to make our events perfect.  The bar area has a lovely set-up where you can have a discussion over lunch or a drink in a reasonably quiet environment."}
{"text":"First time here and gave it a try. Valet parking is very good and it only cost $12. The atmosphere is very nice inside with the grand door in the front. The service is excellent!!!! I gave a 5 star!!! Well manner and the waiter we had explained everything very well. But he need to learn to open the bottle of wine without putting the bottle on the table. The seafood platter was very good but I felt a little expensive at $200.00. Now the downside was the main course. The steak was very poor. My porter house was rough. My wife fish didn't have any taste. I also tried my friend filet mignon and it had no taste. The dessert was very average. If I had to chose at that kind of price steak house I think I would have to pass this next time."}
{"text":"Hy's is my number one spot for happy hour. What's the dealio? Bubbles are 40% off, select wines for $8.00 and some cocktails are 50% off. There's also a tasty list of specially priced food, including one of the best steak sandwiches I've ever eaten. 

I ordered a New York Steak Sandwich (hh $20, regular $29). I ordered my steak medium rare and it came as requested. The steak was so tender, I barely needed to use a knife. The flavor was phenomenal, my steak was squirting with the richness of its own juices. I ordered the baked potato, which was massive and generously topped with scoops of sour cream, bacon and chives. This was the best steak I've eaten. I want to come back to try the featured steaks for dinner (e.g. Neptune, Filet Mignon, Oscar) and lunch.

I can see why Hy's gets such high ratings on Yelp. Service was excellent and the food was superb. Also note that now until Christmas, you can drop off a Christmas toy for The Magic of Christmas, a charity that gives toys to children in need."}
{"text":"First time here. The restaurant atmosphere was good, dark ambient, servers were great, service was great. The cheese toast was really good, something different. The over all food were just ok, nothing that spectacular. My Chicago style NY steak was ordered medium rare but got it as medium, still very tasty, the lobster & baked potato were good. Appetizer Jumbo prawn cocktail & Froster banana were good.  I might come back for another try."}
{"text":"This gets 3.5 stars.  Hy's is indeed a very nice restaurant with a country club-like atmosphere to it.  The servers are all very proper, polite, and even a touch intimidating for us laymen.  

***We went there for a work function, so I can only speak about the limited options that appeared on our special menu.***

Had a smoked salmon dish as an appetizer, which was fresh and heavy for this type of dish.

The garden salad was generously portioned but the lettuce leaves were a little on the wilted side.  Again, the portion was larger than a regular starter salad.

The prime rib was cooked a little too much for a medium rare, but it was mostly excellent and exceptionally tender.  The Yorkshire pudding was burnt, but edible.

Some sort of chocolate brownie thing for dessert that was served nice and warm.  However, by this point, I had consumed too much food and was struggling to get through the dessert.

I would definitely go again and think it is a nice alternative to the chain steakhouses like the Keg, Ruth's Chris, etc."}
{"text":"Would have been 5 if the place we seated had a little glow of lights. I barely see my bills loll ! But over all, the place was great, food I had was sumptuous, Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I'm a little sad when writing this review, as Hy's use to be my favorite restaurant in the city. 

To be honest, I'm not sure if Hy's is slipping, or the rest of the city's meat purveyors have stepped it up a notch.  

My Caesar salad (made table side) was nearly not edible.  It might have been too much garlic or anchovies or both, but it just wasn't good.  The steak I ordered was over cooked and I have a. Hard time believing it was the \"prime\" cut the restaurant says it was.  For a filet it was rather tough. 

I still love the ambiance of the old style steak house, in this case set in an old bank, but it isn't enough to make up for mediocre food.   

I'll stick to Jacobs and co or STK when I'm in the states."}
{"text":"Interesting interior, very cozy and warm. I've visited this place together with my wife for our anniversary. The steak was really good, the wine selection impressive, and the salad was made right in front of our table. Little bit too pricey, but it's definitely worth it for special days. Service was wonderful, waiter had no problem at all with explaining everything we wanted to know, and was checking us couple of times to see if we are satisfied. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I can't even say Hy's Steakhouse without drooling all over myself. That is how good the steaks are. 

While I was trying to figure out what delicious cut of beef I wanted, my waitress informed me that the porterhouse is in fact both a filet mignon and a new york strip with the bone on which adds extra flavour.  Let me tell you, this beast is 22 oz. and worth every penny. 

I split it with my boyfriend and I was absolutely stuffed. The meat was so full of flavour and so soft and tender - I swear it would convert any vegetarian in a second. 

I also had garlic mashed potatoes which were very good. We shared the cauliflower and cheese, which was my favourite side, as well as aspargus, spinach and of course, steak's best friend, mushrooms. All of which were yummy and great compliments for the steak. 

Be warned, Hy's will leave you full and your wallet empty. If it's a special occasion or you feel like splurging, this is an excellent place to do it, but don't expect an inexpensive meal (or a cheap date)."}
{"text":"I would kidding myself If I didn't share with the world that this restaurant's décor somehow remind me of the Rain Forest Café at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. All through dinner, I expected an animated stuffed monkey to pop-out of the cleverly placed plants. Sophistication can certainly be achieved with less. The steaks were ok but it's certainly no Morton's. The service was prompt regardless if they forgot the order of one of our guest. What set the evening was the perfect company of our dear friends from out of town. Perfect."}
{"text":"It was an okay experience for me. I went to Hy's for my best friend's birthday and I wasn't too thrilled about being seated in the lounge with round bar tables. It was an uncomfortable experience as I was squished in with other guests. The food took forever to arrive at our table (almost one hour!). It was hard to eat my filet mignon, my grilled cheese and drink my Singapore Sling while sharing the same table with three other people. Not a fun experience when you're trying your best not to drop your steak! As for the filet mignon itself - it was good but not the best. I was expecting to have some of the best steak that I've had to taste (and hopefully have it make up for the long wait) but I was disappointed to find that it was dry. I've had better steak at places that weren't even at steakhouses (Cactus Club for instance). Honestly, the reason why I didn't rate my experience any lower was because of the company that I was with. I would say that the high points of my experience was the ambiance, the live music and the company. I would probably not go back again due to the amount of time I had to wait and the average steak. The restaurant itself is lovely but the steak that I had could have been so much better."}
{"text":"So Hy's finally reopened after a long hiatus out of the Calgary market.  I loved their old location on 4th Avenue with the \"men's club\" feel about it,  There were very private booths in the lounge  for confidential meetings.  The new location is very upscale and posh but lacks that old club feel.  The food is excellent, albeit very expensive.  The beef stroganoff at lunch is very delicious and reasonable."}
{"text":"Ever since my last trip to Toronto in May 2008, I couldn't wait to review this steakhouse.  Alas, Yelp did not allow reviews of Canadian businesses . . . until now.  I guess all my complaining and helpful suggestions finally paid off.  Probably not.

Trust me, Hy's is so good, it's worth the hassle of getting a passport, figuring out the exchange rate, paying the \"3% foreign transaction fee\" to your bank, and making sure you don't go over 110 kilometers per hour on the expressway.

Hy's is located within walking distance from Rogers Centre, which is why we made reservations at Hy's.  The steakhouse is located in the business district, and I imagine this place gets really busy on weekdays.  I imagine two-martini lunches, during which the top 1% discuss how to get into the top 1/2%.  We went there on Saturday, and the place was empty.

You can't tell by looking at it from the outside, but Hy's feels like an exclusive private club.  Obnoxiously high ceilings, dark mahogany furniture, plush chairs and unmistakable scent of wealth.  I felt richer and more noble the minute I walked in.

The service was absolutely impeccable.  The waiters were professional, knowledgeable and refined.  The place wasn't that busy, but my friend and I truly felt as though we got individual attention.  I had a great view of the table in the distance where assistant waiters were mixing our salads in giant bowls.  Everything--from the white tablecloths to the shiny utensils to the waiters' uniform--was top-notch.

Oh, and then we had some food, too.  Hy's serves corn-fed Alberta beef, which is similar to our Nebraska beef.  My 18-oz New York strip ($49.95 Canadian Dollars) was truly one of the best cuts of beef I'd ever had.  I asked for them to hold the special Hy's sauce because I like my steak with nothing on it.  My friend had the 22-oz porterhouse, which he also enjoyed immensely.

Just like at any other steakhouse in North America, the sides were over-hyped and overlooked by the restaurant.  They were good, but not that special.

I know where I am having dinner the next time I am in Toronto!  Hy's is expensive, but, oh, so worth the money!"}
{"text":"Does not compare to the quality of food or service at 529 Wellington in Winnipeg. 

This Toronto Steakhouse has not impressed me in three visits of last two years. I find the meat over-seasoned and the sauces far too sweet. I do enjoy the garlic cheese toast and high-back booth seating.

Honestly- try the Keg Mansion over this one! The steaks are better and the wallet can breathe."}
{"text":"We went to Hy's to say thank you to one of our staff, a huge steak fan. 

Let's start with The Good:

The service was impeccable. Friendly, relaxed, and not a resting actor in sight. These guys are professionals and it shows. 10/10

The ambience is beautiful. Stunning room, comfortable and quiet. You can actually have a conversation across a table without being overheard. 10/10

The quality of my steak was outstanding. Beautiful piece of cow. 9/10

Now the Not So Good:

To start I ordered the steak tartare. I was served way too cold straight from the fridge. No raw quail's egg, no chopped cornichons, no mustard or shallots on the the side. Instead the dish arrived with a dried up 1/2 hard boiled egg (WTF?) and two equally dried up anchovies. Poor showing, 3/10

My steak. While the meat was excellent, it had been over-seasoned, aggressively so. Also, I had asked for a rare steak, what arrived was on the medium side of medium rare. In a steakhouse this should not happen. 3/10

The sides. While the steak was way too salty, the fries, mashed potatoes and macaroni cheese we had on the side were totally, utterly bland and boring - no flavour of any kind. A huge disappointment. 1/10

Would I go back? I don't think so. We're so spoiled for choice here in Toronto that there are many other restaurants offering better food at both higher and lower pricepoints."}
{"text":"Love Hy's, always a perfect steak - ALWAYS.
Service is top notch. You will never have your wine glass empty - unless you've polished off the bottle.
Cesar salad is fantastic, cheese bread is always a good choice.
Hy's always has us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Second time here and it was 5 star PLUS rating again. The service here is impeccable. Food is top notch and wine, cocktails are amazing. This place is crazy expensive but it's worth every penny for a great dinner out for celebration or if you're really rich. Treat yo self!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience in Toronto. Kitchen was backed up so everything was way delayed, once food arrived, they messed up my order, and on top of it a nothing was take off the bill despite all the delays and mistakes made during the meal. You expect more from a premier steakhouse, not worse service than any fastfood chain.

Too bad Hy's is a great brand but it seems the Toronto location is losing any sense of quality"}
{"text":"Fantastic steak, cooked to perfection. Veggies were beautiful and tasty. The Caesar salad is amazing! Great ambiance, comfy chairs and great service."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner in December 2017. We had a great server that was more than helpful when we were trying to figure out what to order off the menu, we started off with scallops in a passion fruit sauce which was delicious, then I ended up with a 60 day dry aged New Yorker that I already had my eyes on days before our visit. I was very happy with my steak, be aware that a 16oz 60 day dry aged is like eating a 32 oz un-aged steak, super dense and filling. My girlfriend had steak and lobster which I had the chance of trying too. For desert we had the pistachio creme brûlée. Overall a great experience nothing bad to say about this place at all."}
{"text":"Change has come. Everything seems like Hy's is trying to cut corners. First, their onion rings are a different recipe and no longer the size of space shuttle o-rings as I suggested a year ago. Second, no more bread basket. Seriously, you can order a $40 steak and not even get a basket of bread. Finally, their wonderful bathroom towels have been replaced by bog standard brown paper towels. Service is still good. But they're really trying to cheap out these days. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on my anniversary.  We both had the rib-eye which came with potatoes.  We ordered the mac and cheese and cauliflower au gratin as sides to share, and a nice bottle of wine.

First, the atmosphere:  I loved the look of the restaurant when we first walked in.  We were greeted by the hostess who offered to check our coats and sat us.  I really liked the romantic feel of the place with the high ceilings and dim lighting.  The building itself is just beautiful inside and the chairs were incredibly comfortable.  

Second, the food:  It started with bread.  I was pleasantly surprised that the complimentary bread was actually garlic bread.  I love garlic bread, so that was a plus.  When the meals came I couldn't believe how big the portions were.  The steaks were beautifully cooked, and the potatoes were nice and hot!  So often I get mashed potatoes and they're luke warm, when I like my food piping hot.  The mac and cheese was absolutely delicious, and the cauliflower as well.  

Third, the price:  My boyfriend and I knew we wanted to go to a steakhouse for our anniversary and looked around for the perfect place.  One of the reasons we choose Hy's is because you got more for your money.  The steaks were in the same range as other higher end steak houses, but it was the only restaurant that had potatoes or rice come with the steak.  The accompaniments were only $10 or so more, and were definitely big enough to share.  There was so much food that I had a full lunch leftover for the next day (and boy it was delicious!)

Last, the service:  Overall I was impressed with the service.  Our waiter was very pleasant and did not rush us.  That being said, the fact that he didn't rush us was also his downfall.  When we finally asked for the bill, I had my credit card out almost immediately.  We waited a long time for him to finally run it.  Other than that, however, I was pleased with the service."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant in a nice setting and very central and the steaks are fine here.  There's nothing to complain about.  The décor is what you'd expect from a Hy's and the service, even in the bar lounge where I ate.  You see, no one in our party decided to wear anything other than shorts, so no dining room for us.  Fair enough, that would be our mistake.  Bar eating is fine with me.

The meal in the bar is exactly the same as that served in the dining room so there's no loss.  Even so, the bar itself is pretty well appointed and decorative.  The staff are pleasant and the meal comes to order as you'd expect.  There's worse steaks in the city for sure, but I can't help feeling that there's also better.  Regardless, you're in for a good time."}
{"text":"We had the calamari, seared scallops and seared ahi tuna for appetizer. I had the steak (fillet mignon) and lobster with garlic mashed potatoes with a side of asparagus and mushroom. Absolutely perfect. All of it. The steak was incredibly tender, the mashed potatoes fluffy and the lobster flavorful. The atmosphere is very classy, it's dimly lit but not so dark you have to strain and fairly quiet. Our waiter Mikey took excellent care of us. He was present when needed but we never noticed him quietly clearing plates or refilling wine while we were in conversations. Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This place was a WONDERFUL addition to Calgary's restaurant life! My service was exceptional, the food was AMAZING, everything made to PERFECTION! Very relaxed chill atmosphere, music was good, not too loud, a definite go to place to get out of the hustle-bustle of everyday and have a DELICIOUS meal:)"}
{"text":"Their steaks are fantastic, but that's to be expected if you are paying $60+ for your steak. Great atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Perfect Caesar salad made at table. Tender and delicious filet mignon. A perfect meal."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group (~22 people) that were in town for a conference.  The space itself is beautiful. The events coordinator was extremely accommodating.  Wait staff was fantastic.  But - by far, the best part was the food.  Steaks were delicious and cooked perfectly.  Worth the price."}
{"text":"It was a Valentina's day dinner . I was impressed by 
Outstanding service, piano music ,atmosphere everything was great. 
Steak was very tendered and tasty.
The best thing to me , even there were many  people at the restaurant ,
We enjoyed privacy . This place is very spacious ."}
{"text":"My experiences at Hy's have been mixed. In one visit I ordered a medium-rare pepper steak. It was great! The next visit... A couple of months later, I ordered the same thing but the steak was grisly and chewy. I also found the service to be inconsistent, but overall my experiences have been more positive than not."}
{"text":"I was a guest of an invitation this past Monday where we met for dinner. First, the physical space is nice - well located in the downtown area, open, well furnished and inviting. The group sat together in a room where we spent the entire dinner.

The server was smooth and professional - this guy did not miss a beat keeping drinks, water and appetizers full. Orders were taken and conversations were continued until service. This is where the disappointment starts. Nice plate, white linen napkin, real steak knife - then the first cut into the $62 filet was made. I was salivating and looking forward to biting into the medium rare beef. Nope. The filet was cooked blue - not even close the medium rare.

Again, the server was observant and astute enough to ask what he could do - I asked for it to be cooked to medium rare. Looking around there were at least three other steaks that were not cooked to order.

Hy's, a few comments. You market brand as a steak house. You sell your products at a premium relative to other suppliers. So, I would expect that when I order m/r I receive an expertly cooked piece of beef.

Personally, I would not return on my own given the price point and inability to deliver the goods.

Again, the server was a 5-star!"}
{"text":"My fiancé & I dined in at Hy's for the first time. All I have to say is, WOW. This was an amazing & wonderful experience. The ambiance is pure sexy & romantic. Our steaks merely melted in our mouth. Our server, Jimmy, surpassed our service expectations & offered us chives, bacon bits & sour cream with our potatoes. He made this dinner very special for us. It was an all time treat to eat here! Every time we come to Toronto, we will def revisit the restaurant. Hands down!"}
{"text":"First off I wanted to say I had such High hopes for this restaurant from seeing some of the pictures and reviews on yelp. My husband and I were celebrating our 5th anniversary and in Toronto and wanted to have a bit of a fancy dinner. After scrolling yelp we landed on Hy's. We then called to make a renovation and settled for the lounge which is a smaller venue of the restaurant near the bar. We were perfectly fine and actually enjoyed our seat by the window. Our waitress started out the night very attentive and helpful. Though I should have known something was off after ordering my drink which was very, very strong and personally i believe over poured. The waitress did correct the drink and we proceeded to order our dinner.
Dinner that night was beef wellington and a filet with baked potato. Everything looked absolutely stunning unfortunately it did not taste that way. Don't get me wrong it was not the worst meal I ever had but when you're paying top dollar you expect top quality. If my husbands filet was $30 instead of $60 I think I would not be as disappointed. However it was a $60 tough filet and very hard to eat.In fact half of it ended up on the plate and was gristle. As for my beef wellington, it was ok but defiantly not as flavorful and tender as I was expecting.
I also forgot to mention that as the night went on our server spent more time chatting with the staff than waiting on us.Overall I was very disappointed and what was worse was that we needed up spending $160 for a ver lack luster anniversary mea"}
{"text":"I came into this beautiful restaurant to meet a few friends not expecting to eat. Walking in to this restaurant was very appealing to the eyes. The decor is modern and beautiful, the restaurant is very spacious and cleverly designed with private dining rooms used for business functions. The waiters and waitresses are extremely professional  and cater to all your needs.  Between 4 of us we ordered a strip loin and a rib eye steak with lobster tail and vegetables and french fries on the side. The steak was one of the best I have ever tasted. The fat on the rib eye steak was perfectly marbled into the steak and the striploin was flavourful and cooked to perfection.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Nice elegant steakhouse, food was consistently good across all of our large party orders. Service was okay. Prices seemed on the high side. Also I was not impressed with the ambience (too dark)."}
{"text":"We have been here three times, for various celebrations. I did not have high hopes for a chain steakhouse - and I was happy to be wrong.  I preferred it over some of the other houses.  We really like the atmosphere, our service experience has been excellent, as was the food quality.  We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"It's old school style steak house with an eye to the business crowd.  Service is friendly, prompt an professional.  Water or wines are topped up (often without noticing!) so be careful if you're driving.

Oysters app fresh and accompanied by appropriate sauces etc.  fresh and expertly shucked without any shell residue!

Steak cooked perfectly medium rare and side dishes abundant.  Onion rings were tasty treat.  Cheeses garlic bread to start a little too tasty.  Overall a good experience and consistent quality over the years.  It is a bit more pricey but not completely over the top."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for a fine dining experience! The service is excellent. We had the beef carpaccio, escargot, and I ordered the rack of lamb. All was very well executed. They even have cheese toast which was to die for! I ordered a glass of Sangiovese and it was the best red I had ever tasted. The wine menu is extensive and I think they must do their own wine mixing from certain regions. I would go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable. The food was good, though not the greatest steak I've ever had. The crab cake was one of the best. The double baked potato was very dry. The onion rings were good and huge. The ahi tuna had an interesting flavour to it, not my favourite. We got bananas fosters for dessert and I've never had it before, it was fun watching the server make it table side, but it wasn't good. This place is nice to go to once in a while but I wouldn't recommend it as your go-to steak house. It's overpriced. I don't mind spending the money once in a while but I can certainly get good steak elsewhere for a more decent price. If you're short like me, do not sit at the booths, they are not comfortable. If you have a Costco membership, get the gift cards if you plan on eating here."}
{"text":"Really mixed experience at Hy's for dinner - phenomenal service and atmosphere, disappointing food quality. 

Since Hy's opened downtown, I've been meaning to give it a try and so I made it a point to book a business dinner there recently. I had no idea they have such a spacious interior - it was immaculate, classy, upscale, and lit appropriately (other than the extremely bright TV in the lounge area showing sports, shining it's light onto our table). 

The Service was also fantastic, which needless to say is expected for this price point. The staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. The table side service options for a few of the menu choices was also pretty entertaining. 

However, I am pretty disappointed with the quality of the food. I started with the seared scallops. While I firmly believe that scallops should never be overcooked, the scallops i received were still cool in the center... which is great for a sushi joint, but not so much in this application. 

The $60+ steak I ordered was the most disappointing part of the meal. Hy's paints an amazing picture of how amazing their steak is. I ordered my steak rare, it came medium-rare to medium. Even a medium rare steak should still be juicy, and I found my steak to be the driest piece of expensive steak I have had in a long time - I had to choke it down. 

Rather than the potato side, I opted for the Gorgonzola Macaroni (Mac and Cheese), which was underseasoned and on the dry side. I would have also opted for some sort of greens, but upon seeing that steamed broccoli would have been an extra $11 or something, I figured I'd pass even if it wasn't coming out of my own pocket. It's a shame that the greens aren't a standard provided side. 

I later queried my entire table and we all agreed that our steaks were disappointing, which was only amplified by the fact that they were at such a upscale price point.

At $125 a person including drinks, I need to be blown away by the food in addition to the experience; and unfortunately the food was lacking. For comparison, I went to The Keg twice later that week and both times I got consistent, rare, juicy steaks (for half the price)."}
{"text":"This may well replace my other Calgary Haunt. We dropped in for lunch between meetings and sunk into the most comfortable chair in any restaurant lounge I can imagine. Very sadly we could not imbibe in a cocktail, but this only gives another reason to return. Instead, I ordered an intoxicating cup Mulligatawny Soup, and was not disappointed in the least. Service is attentive, but somewhat more aloof than most similar Calgary eateries. Salads are HUGE (as they should be for 20 CAD). I'd skip the 8 CAD \"cheese toast;\" Buy bread and cheese at home, and challenge your culinary skills."}
{"text":"Second time dining at Hy's and absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere and impeccable service. Had the NY strip and cooked to perfection. Tasted fantastic. My wife had the filet mignon which she loved. Great Manhattan and wine list. When I'm back in Toronto, I will be back to Hy's"}
{"text":"The Steak was ok the service was average. I would not go back. Over priced for the money. It is a dark restaurant.Wine prices were way to high . There is a reason why you could walk in with no wait"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday on a Saturday night because he loves steaks and we have tried most of the other steakhouses in Toronto already. My boyfriend is a huge steak fan, and we have gone to a lot of steakhouses in both New York City (where we used to live) and Toronto, as well as cooking it at home, so we know what we are talking about when it comes to steaks. Here's a quick rundown of the pros and cons:

Pros:
Great old-school romantic ambience and service. We couldn't fault our waiter at all - he was great, even bringing a complimentary cake for the birthday. They give you great garlic cheese toast, which is complimentary with your meal. The sides are also good, and a potato is included with your steak, which is not common with other comparable steakhouses. Lastly, the steaks are VERY BIG. My bone-in ribeye was 16 oz.

Cons:
The steak. Cooked properly, but the quality was disappointing. The bone-in ribeye I had was good, but my boyfriend's porterhouse was not good at all. At $50 a pop, we expected a lot more.

Verdict:
There are a lot of good things about Hy's, and with the great ambiance and service, and tasty free garlic toast, we really wanted to like this restaurant. But the main reason we went there, the steak, was lacking. For it's price point, it's not worth it. For the price range this restaurant is in, the steak quality was disappointing. If you want a premium steak, I would save up my money and go to Jacob's or Harbour Sixty instead. Go if you're in the neighborhood and have a corporate card, and avoid the porterhouse."}
{"text":"Pretty decent steakhouse in the city. Unbelievable old fashioned are made here! Avoid ribeye steak at all costs as it's a slab of skinny meat you will see at a loblaw shrieked wrapped for $9.99. really disappointing. Filet is what you get."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience. The restaurant itself is quite nice, with extremely high ceilings and just a feeling of elegant space. It felt like they had tried harder to move away from the classic steakhouse look. Having eaten at Ruth's Chris last week, I felt I was in a good position to judge this establishment.

The appetizers were excellent. I had raw oysters and they were very tasty, while two co-workers had soup and 3 had steak tartare. I tried it and it was tasty.

My steak was excellent too. Normally I don't go for the rib-eye but I wanted to give it a shot. I ordered it medium, but it was closer to what I'd call medium-rare, but thats also acceptable. It was tender and perhaps one of the most flavorful steaks I've had. The double baked potato was also excellent, as was the asparagus.

For dessert I had Creme Brulee which was one of the best I've had. Service was excellent.

Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great steak. Solid service but server was not overly friendly. Too bad. Because the food was pretty darn good. Food was 5 stars. Service made it a 3."}
{"text":"Went to Hy's for lunch yesterday.  It was the first time we had been to their new restaurant, and it is beautiful.  The front is the bar (not quite like the Owl's Next) and we were next to the windows overlooking 8th Avenue.  Great for people watching.  I don't eat too much meat and I asked if they had salmon and after checking our server came back and said I could have anything my heart desired.  He was excellent and talked us into the cheese toast.  My friend had a steak which was a little over done as she wanted it medium rare.  They took it away and brought back one cooked to perfection. 

Loved the whole experience, and we definitely will be going back.  It is a little expensive, but for special occasions, or just because it is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Came here with a group of 10 people and the waiter seemed to be in a rush to get us out of the restaurant. He was rude and had no patience whatsoever. I ordered my filet medium, it came to me rare. I asked the waiter if this is this normal for a medium? His response was \"this is what our mediums look like here\". I haven't seen a medium cooked steak looking so bloody and raw in my life. Had a cheese cake for desert, that was the only thing delicious."}
{"text":"I've heard way too much about this restaurant and had already developed a strange hyped up version of what it would be in my head prior to our supper last night. My anticipation caused me to revert back to the teenage girl I once was and play dress up.

Parking for this location is great for the evenings, as there is street parking and also the safety of the underground parkade in the adjacent mall.

We had reserved ahead of time, so there was no wait time for our table. The start of service for us was a but unorganized as we weren't sure who our server was and were asked for our drink orders multiple times. Plus the table was not set prior to us being sat, therefore the bussers had to clumsily attempt to set it after we had ordered drinks. The cocktails we ordered (The Lady Germain & The Forbidden Fruit) were on point, although price point was a bit high (which we had expected before hand) and the wait time on them felt like forever. To my horror after reading other reviews... I was not offered a water type!

The menu was easy to navigate but no specials or explanations were offered by our server (i.e. soup of the day). As it was V-Day, we got some Fresh Oysters ;) which were scrumptious and have me salivating at the mere recall of them. The server upsaled us on \"Cheese Toast for two\", which we were glad to have as we were... starving by the time it arrived.  

I ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon with Baked Potato. The potato is presented undressed and toppings are added at table side. I asked for all the toppings, and felt quite overwhelmed by the amount of sour cream the server decided to plop on it in one go (still delicious though btw). But I must say, the filet mignon was by far the best I've ever had, never have I had one so tender yet juicy all at the same time! The seasoning was perfect :D The boyfriend was very satisfied with his Bone-In Rib Steak with Rice Pilaf as well.

Service as I've mentioned was a bit off last night. No one had told me about the quiet server that we would get that would spill our drink and frown at the grains of rice the boyfriend got on table and he couldn't quite scrap off, or the stares he gave our spots of tabasco on the table cloth that occurred from my lack of coordination. With EVERYTHING in mind, it was still a great night out :D Will be back for sure as I would love to experience the \"Hy's Tableside Service\"."}
{"text":"A very impressive steakhouse.
There are good steakhouses (Barberian's and even The Keg at its price point) and there is the completely disappointing (hello Ruth Chris and your useless oily meat!) and Hy's falls in the former category...
The room is dim, well-appointed and immaculately clean. It is a very special dining room behind the large entrance.
The service was polite and attentive. There was no pushy selling or intrusion. The waitress was there when needed and not there when not. 
The hostess was well put together and presentable. She had a polite and sincere smile on her face.
We had the day's special peppercorn steak and it was exactly as ordered and deliciously tender and tasty. The Liver is also another dish I would recommend. I tried it and it was very well done. The side of asparagus and garlic mashed potato were very good.
The cheese bread sounds tacky and cheap, but theirs was light, fluffy and again delicious.
That would be my only criticism of Hy's. For the price and the type of restaurant a complimentary basket of high-end bread and accompaniment is a must! However, that is not enough to deduct a point.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a fantastic meal here to celebrate his big promotion. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. A bit pricey for what you get (steak plus one side) but the steak is so good you almost don't care. Will definitely be back for another celebration."}
{"text":"Amazing place. BEST STEAK EVER. The steak is always fresh and amazingly seasoned.
The chef is high end and understands the difference between medium rare and medium, simple as that. The french onion soup here it's FANTASTIC. 
The Service is AMAZING. Our server was very tentive, caring and took his time. Sometimes they have live music so that was a really nice change. 

Top notch place but of course the cost is expensive but worth every dollar on food and service! 2 person bill cost about $200 with drinks.
ALWAYS TIP GOOD HERE, they deserve it, they're amazing!"}
{"text":"Alright, so, yeah, maybe I'm a teenie weenie bit bias when it comes to this restaurant, being that I had my wedding dinner here. But I can GUARANTEE you, that dinner was magical and couldn't have been more perfect and it was because we were at this place. Everyone person left there happy. 

The staff catered to us so well, we had to worry about NOTHING. I reserved for less people than planned and they accommodated us in the back room, all at one family style table, it was a beautiful night. Everyone seemed to have enjoyed their food. 

I will say, we went back on Valentine's Day and although, great (really great), we left with slight, and I mean SLIGHT, feeling of dissatisfaction. I think we were chasing the Hy's high. Mind over matter baby.

Both times, service was impecable, it is a bit dim, but whatever. I love them for giving me one of the best nights of my life. A night I will remember until the day I die."}
{"text":"This place makes me think of what it'd be like to be a mobster in the 1920's. Dark, old school interior and creepy servers. Doesn't work in today's economy or younger business professionals. Everything you order you pay for. Pretty ridiculous. I mean come-on $3 for tap water!!! WTF. I have never been charged for tap water in my life and can't believe that's a thing. Food was sub-par at best. Expensive, under seasoned and boring old school flavor. I won't be going back here. Get with the times...if I want a good steak I'm def gonna make it myself, if I want a good piece of meat with a great atmosphere I'm going to head to Hayden block."}
{"text":"This place had a good ambience but is very over-priced even for a shared meal.  Overpriced.  My steak was not well done as I requested and the server we had could have cared less.  The vegetables were good but steaks and service were by far one of the worst at any steak house that I have experienced. $200 for a shared 8 ounce filet mug on, broccoli, asparagus and a moderately priced wine.  Keg is better and better service and they CARE."}
{"text":"To be clear, I'm not a red meat lover which is what Hy's is known for, so my review is limited to the appies and my salmon main. Delicious! All of it! Service was amazing. Pricey, yes, but this is somewhere that you get what you pay for. Our friends raved about their steak and cheese toast, my salmon main was delicious and we certainly appreciated the level of service allowing our conversation to be uninterrupted. This is a classic!"}
{"text":"One more star cause at least they tried?

My options with cocktails before dinner were: 6 stalks of asparagus with mustard.
My appetizer: Nothing. I sat and watched awkwardly as others ate their, smoked salmon, shrimp of beef carpaccio.
Salad: house or ceasar, I had the house - Terrible brown soggy lettuce. Some sent their salads back. I manage to eat half.
Main: Yellow lentils and roasted vegetables. A bit salty but ok. Its funny because as I was told \"the chef doesn't to that tofu stuff\" to which I replied \"can't he do lentils or something else then?\" and so lentils it was.
Dessert: Cut up strawberries and fruit.

The staff are really friendly polite and really make an effort. But I feel this place is stuck in another era.  Way too old school. Other people that had the steak complained on the size of the sides and mentioned that they would have liked to seen a bit more emphasis on the side dishes.  You can't just grill a big piece of meat and plop down a little spoon full of mashed potato and a piece of broccoli these days. Hy's really needs to revamp their menu."}
{"text":"Decor,  Ambiance, Service and the Food, everything just absolutely just right.
From cocktails at the bar to the key lime pie.
Wasn't cheap of course but way worth it!"}
{"text":"Only been once and i rave about the Filet Mignon whenever the subject of downtown or restaurants come up. Will definitely go again.

Put on your top shelf clothes and don't look at the prices, just smile and enjoy the great food :)"}
{"text":"Hy's has always been a favorite spot when I want a true \"old school\" steak house. You have wingback chairs, piano bar, incredible steaks and a big \"big wine\" list. 

Of course, you pay for it. On my recent trip it was to escape the Keg which was packed and we got the quiet atmosphere and outstanding service we were seeking. The shrimp cocktail ($16) was pricey for 4 shrimp and the crab cakes were too (2 for $18). 

Worthwhile but say the magic words: HERE IS MY CORPORATE CARD!"}
{"text":"As I try to think up of a good way to review this place, I always seem to get tangled up in what I want to say. I put this place in a class with Ruth's Chris; expensive meals, good meals, but not necessarily the best value.

I have gone to Hy's only a handful of times for lunch. Inside the building is a lounge area and a seating area. The seating area is usually full of 'suits'; guys who look like all they do is talk about business and what stocks they've traded today. The allure of an expensive restaurant draws these types of people in.

The restaurant area itself has very high ceilings and very old furniture. The furniture itself is very worn in, so depending your preference, the booth style seats may compress so that you feel you are a kid at the table. It is a very quiet atmosphere that adds a touch of elegance.

I have felt that the service staff treats you as you should for the price you are paying. For lunch I usually get a steak and have always found it to be very good. The other member usually in my party always gets the appetizer spare ribs as their meal. These spare ribs are huge and very delicious. A crispy outer meat that is not dried out after you bite into it. Nicely salted, I will admit it is good, but I enjoy steak a bit more.

P.S. Try the garlic bread since other reviewers say its phenomenal."}
{"text":"While the interior is that of a typical old school steakhouse, it is far too dark and needs to be updated. 
Prices are over the top for what you are getting. I ordered the 10oz NY strip and what arrived was the equivalent quality steak of what you would get at a supermarket. It felt like it was cooked in a George Forman grill, there were no char/sear marks and was tasteless. I would rank the steak at The Keg higher caliber with better flavour. The side dishes at Hy's are nothing to brag about either and were very mediocre.
Was disappointed with my first visit to Hy's last night and won't be back. Jacob's or Morton's over this place all day long."}
{"text":"Best steak ever.
Best cheese toast ever.
Best key lime pie ever.
Best service ever.

My wife and I came in for an early dinner after work after being turned away elsewhere for not having a reservation. Hy's welcomed us in to their lounge immediately with the only condition that they had a limited menu until 5pm as they were in the process of changing their kitchen over from the lunch menu to dinner. Not a problem as were were ok with having a glass of wine and a few appetizers.

Our server greeted us shortly after sitting down and offered us our choice of distilled, sparkling or ice water. She returned with our waters and their wine list which is housed digitally on an iPad.

After giving us a few minutes to peruse the wine choices she returned to take our order and give us the verbal rundown of the food available. We were both pleasantly surprised that they were offering a steak sandwich during this time of turnover and both chose to go with that option along with some cheese toast to start.

Now you might be thinking to yourself \"Really Chris? Cheese toast?\". This was the best darn cheese toast anyone has ever served me. The cheese blend is mouthwatering and the bread is broiled to perfection. The bread hasn't just been shoved through an oven to melt the cheese, the cheese is nice and crispy on top. They also cover the basket with tinfoil when bringing it to your table so the cheese stays gooey and warm until your ready to take your first bite.

They grill the steaks in a glassed-off area in the restaurant so you can see your cut being cooked right in front of you, should you be sitting in the right place in the restaurant. My wife and I had front row seats.

The steak sandwiches arrived just as we were wrapping up our last bites of the appetizer. Perfect timing. For my side I went with the mashed potatoes. They were thoroughly pureed, not a lump to be found and piped onto the plate in a fancy looking mound. They could have used a little more seasoning but were still quite enjoyable. The steak was almost twice the size of the toast its served on. I had my steak the only way a steak should be cooked, medium rare, and my half-inch thick slice of heaven was done perfectly. 

The steak was tender and juicy and a very large portion for what you would be expecting when you order a steak sandwich. The price is also par for the serving size coming in just under $27.

The after dinner menu has a large range of port and cognac options ranging from $10-200 a glass. There are a few warm options too like a B52 or blueberry tea. The dessert section has a few solid choices. While I would have chosen the Bananas Foster, my wife wasn't feeling as adventurous and we went with the key lime pie to share.

The size of the slice is the same as you would expect from any restaurant, but the dessert is on a different level from your average restaurant. The crust was nice and crumbly. The filling had a creamy colour to it, not some weird fake green colour you get with a store bought pie. You could tell it wasn't some frozen pie they buy from a food supplier and thaw out a piece for you. The slice was also topped with a healthy amount of whipped cream.

The total for all of the above with two glasses of wine was just over $100 including tax. A price easily worth paying again and again for one of the best steaks you'll find anywhere.

Kudos to the staff for their excellent service. From the ladies at the door with their warm smiles and greetings, to our server who was there just at the right time and not overbearing, and the gentlemen clearing our plates that seemed to come out of nowhere and disappear just as quickly, great job by all."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Hy's.  Our server Jordan was very accommodating and personable.  The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was elegant and pleasing to the eye.  They had live music in the bar area whic was a nice surprise.
It's rather pricey, but worth the cost.  Get the Cesar salad which is made table side."}
{"text":"Pricey but good. My favourite combination: oysters (one of the best in town), great meat and the stuffed potato. Good list of wines. 
Downtown great location."}
{"text":"I have had the privilege of dining here a couple times now. The food has almost always been excellent (the cheese toast is amazing as everyone says). The chicken has been my personal favorite here. The only thing I have disliked was the Lamb. The service is mostly good I have had only had one or two bad experiences withs servers."}
{"text":"I do agree that Hys has some of the better steaks in town. We came here with a large group and got to try a variety of their dishes and most were pretty decent. The cheesy toasts are always a good start but try to save some room for the actual meal! A little bit more on the high side in regards to dinner prices but worth a try."}
{"text":"I love Hy's!  Especially their Calf Liver & Onions.  Very, very tender calf liver with 2 strips of bacon on a bed of mashed potato with fresh vegetables of the day.  The vegetables are usually beets with some greens.  

Great customer service always!  Thanks, Hetty, our server!"}
{"text":"Very very traditional steak house, was there for a business dinner. They have very nice private dining rooms in the back. Honestly I think the food was just a bit lackluster, nothing really stood out, the steak was very mediocre for a fancy steakhouse. My rating can be broken down to - Atmosphere 4.5 stars, service 4.5, food 3.5."}
{"text":"We've been to this location twice for our anniversary. The experience both times was amazing!

The people attending your table are authentic, friendly and there to help you enjoy your evening. 

We had table side prepared salads. The Ceasar is traditional but the spinach salad is cooked with a flaming pan, quite the experience to witness. 

The steaks have always been cooked to perfection and are enough to leave you more than satisfied. You must try the asparagus and the mushrooms, you won't regret it. 

Over all I would recommend this place if you are looking to celebrate a milestone or just looking for a solid meal to treat yourself."}
{"text":"I had eaten there last week. Time between March 1 and March 15. It's absolutely lovely service is in peccable and they're still serving Alberta beef which is the best that Canada has to offer. It was a joy"}
{"text":"This restaurant might be pricey, but you get what you pay for - the food is simply outstanding!  I was visiting from Houston and Hy's was just as good as the best steakhouses I've eaten at in Texas!

Everything I ate was amazing:

- Cheese Toast (5/5): Superb!!  This was basically a decadent grilled cheese sandwich, and it was simply fantastic.  Gooey, melted cheese oozing out between two slabs of buttered toast.  We ordered two servings of these to share as appetizers for the table and they lasted all of 5 minutes before being devoured.  If you come to Hy's, get these to share (or not)... you can always start the diet tomorrow.

- Caesar Salad (4/5): Prepared table-side for the \"ooh-aah\" factor.  The lettuce, cheese, and croutons were pretty standard as far as caesars go, but the sauce absolutely made this dish.  Right away I could tell that they had incorporated a nice amount of anchovies into their Caesar salad dressing, because it had that beautiful, pungent taste that only briny fish can provide (which is a very good thing for a proper Caesar!)

- NY Strip (5/5): Whoa.  My 14 oz steak was absolutely stunning.  Probably in the top 3 steaks I've ever eaten in my life.  Beautifully medium-rare as requested (even a bit on the rare side, which is fine by me!)  Lovely salt-and-pepper rub... quite simple, but just enough to bring out the flavor of the meat.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender and juicy.  I savored every single bite and I was sad when it was all gone.

- Sides (4/5): For the table, we also shared a side dish of sautéed mushrooms (excellent!  Would highly recommend these), broccoli (good, but nothing to rave about... it's hard to elevate broccoli, after all), and my steak also came with a baked potato (lightly salted, didn't require anything additional to bring out the flavor, although they were kind enough to offer bacon bits, cheese, and sour cream)

- Dessert (4/5): Despite being about ready to burst, I ordered a slice of their cheesecake and greatly enjoyed it.  Light and fluffy, with a generous dollop of fresh fruit compote on top.  Most of my coworkers opted for their famous bananas foster (flambéed table-side) - I had a small bite and it was excellent!  And I say this as someone who used to live in New Orleans, where bananas foster was invented - this could give the original at Brennan's a run for their money!

My only major gripes is that the service was slow (our waiter was very pleasant and polite, but seemed to forget about us for long stretches of time... for example, he took nearly 30 minutes to take our orders after being seated) and that they didn't provide bread and butter, which I thought was pretty standard for steakhouses, but maybe that's just a US thing.  Anyways, not enough to detract from an otherwise 5-star experience.

OVERALL: 5/5.  If you come to Calgary and want to have one amazing meal, splurge on Hy's Steakhouse - everything here is worth the money (and calories).  Absolutely delicious food, and some of the best steak I've ever eaten in my life.  Had a fantastic experience here and with any luck, I'll be able to dine here again the next time I'm visiting."}
