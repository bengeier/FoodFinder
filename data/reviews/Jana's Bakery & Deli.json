{"text":"I personally like this deli, it's in a convenient place (close to home) I love their meat selections and the dry sausage is excellent... I haven't had very many of their pastries except for one, which I am not sure what it's called... it is in the shape of a triangle with filling is of either cream cheese or fruit filling... they are YUM!! They people have always been very courteous and informative. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Jana's (the Phx location) for years, so I decided to stop in today. 

First of all, please know that Jana's is a European deli and bakery. They have absolutely wonderful and traditionally made favorites. Their Polish sausage is absolutely WONDERFUL! My favorite pastry is the Kolaczkis. They are perfectly flakey and moist at the same time. Their food brings back wonderful memories of my Polish grandmother! 

Thank you Jana's!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this bakery but I don't. This is the second time I have gone... wanting to give the place a second chance and the staff is very dry and cold. I purchased several items and each one tasted almost exactly the same. They each were very tasteless, dry and really just not good at all.  The items look absolutely beautiful, but are a disappointment in every other area.  Too bad, because it's very convenient from where I live."}
{"text":"We got some sweets (don't know their names) and bread here, and they were amazing. Seemed authentic as the rest of the clientele were conversing with the owner in Polish."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why the last reviewer would think the food here authentic, just because some patrons were conversing with the shopgirl in Polish.  Granted, there is that old chestnut which states, that if you see people of the same ethnicity as the restaurant dining there, it must be good.  

Well, try again!

People, who are Polish don't necessarily go to Jana's because it's the best; they go there simply because that's all there is folks!  The Valley's Polish establishments are few and far between and they know how to charge you for the privilege of eating food like you had at mama's back in Krakow.  But while some of Jana's donuts and pastries are spot on \"Polish\", many of their cakes are oversweetened  (by European standards).  The bread -- especially the rye bread -- is good, but frequently dry.  The sausage products good, but overpriced for the most part  (for less expensive meats and more variety, try Warsaw Village, located not so far away by car).  The prices for their stuffed cabbage and other \"specialty meals\", as one reviewer put it, is not outrageous, but no bargain.  The stocked produce  (barszcz, pate, cheeses, sauerkraut, etc.) is more expensive than at Warsaw Village, sometimes by multiples.  The makowiec -- the poppy pastry previously referred to -- is usually quite good.  If you buy it, I recommend NOT to take advantage of the day old ones they sell on the cheap:  this cake dries out fast.

Service is efficient, polite and friendly.  Variety of goods, fairly good  (again, Warsaw Village beats them out).  For a \"bakery\", you really can't fault their small selection of non-baked goods.  If you're looking for authentic Polish food, you'll find it here; especially where pastries are concerned.  However, their propensity to oversweeten, to no doubt please Americans' tastes, is unfortunate.

Best summed up:  most  likely the best Polish pastry place west of Chicago  (though Europa Pastry Cafe gives them a run for their money).  But like mama's back home? Yeah, I think not."}
{"text":"Sernik was spot on, excellent! As were the kolache, and I'm still laughing at the review that said they picked up cannoli...it's a Polish place- no cannoli here ;)  We love that we can grab those items we miss from Poland, yes they are expensive but not overly so, that happens when you import products. The kielbasa are tasty as well. We haven't tried any pierogi yet, I'm excited to do so. 
Bring cash, a smile, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This bakery has been here a while now. I did not stop in until a couple of days ago. 

I can not speak on the deli aspect of it, I did not get any meats. 

I did however ask for one item that in on the menu. I was told this is a special order item. Well then state it as such. So I got a poppy seed something or other. It was dough with poppy seed shaped in to a roll. One personal sized lemon cake and an eclair. The poppy seed doohickey had no flavour, I mean nothing. The eclair was pretty bland and tasted as less than stellar ingredients were used. The lemon cake was so bad it was trash canned after one bite. 

So I can honestly say I have had better. Arizona has a hard time with good bakeries. 

The bakery it self felt bordering on depressing. I could not stay there for long."}
{"text":"This place has authentic european pastries. Delicous freshly baked nice staff, they are Polish and very nice staff. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Small bakery - we were looking for authentic Polish foods for the Easter Wiglia - the sausage she has here is mass produced like you would find at any grocery. Here they open the plastic package and display open, as if it were fresh and homemade. It is not. What we got was decent but nowhere as good as what we find in Chicago.  Phoenix you need a real Polish deli"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Expensive and limited selection. Won't be back.  The woman working seemed uninterested in helping us and were the only ones in the store."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries and so much more

Jana's Bakery offers so many great pastries and so much more.  I enjoy trying and looking at the Polish pastries and breads. The napoleons, cookies, fruit filled sweet breads are the best. It's great that you can buy grocery items also.


Whether grocery shopping, ordering a special dessert, or looking for a  sweet or salty snack, Jana's Bakery is the place. In addition, to the freshness and reasonable pricing, the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"WOW!!! A real European bakery!  This was awesome, after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachi's and walnut roll home for later.  The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.  Next special occasion my cake is coming from there.  :-)

The one we visited is 
13331 W. Indian School Rd.

{"text":"This review is only for paczki and nothing else.  We first stopped by when driving through town only to get disappointed with it not being open on Monday - fine, our fault for assuming everything is open 7 days a week.  
On our way back, on Saturday, we stopped again with a five day long anticipation of eating paczki.  What a waste of time, gas, and huge dissapointment.  The second star is for making these things successfully look like paczki, which is the reason why we came after seeing a picture on Yelp.  The flavor is 100% Dunkin Donuts donut.  Nothing wrong with it if that's your thing.  But if you're told it's paczki and they look it, too, especially after having spent few years since having them - it's a big dissapointment.  So, if these were named donuts, I'd happily rate them five stars as far as donuts go.  But as paczki, two stars is a generous rating, with the second star for successfully pulling off the joke.
Btw, I'm raised in Poland Polish, so quite familiar with the original."}
{"text":"Very expensive. No selection.  Horrible customer service. The lady literally didn't listen to my order. I ordered a cannoli for me and a cookie for my baby. Well the cookie never made it in the bag (that was probably for the best) and the cannoli was awful. I got charged $.50 because I used a card instead of cash. I'm not sure what this business is but I'm starting to think its not even a bakery. It was horrible. Just horrible."}
{"text":"Let start by saying horrible customer service for being the only ones in there. The lady was very uninterested in taking our order and I brought my mother here who is visiting out of town to get breakfast. So glad I didn't order anything and give this establishment my money because, her little \"hole in the wall\" shop doesn't deserve my money I worked hard for. *Drops mic*"}
{"text":"In my travels to the local post office, I pass this place almost daily but have yet to stop until today.  Having some free time on this holiday weekend, it seemed appropriate to stop in and check out the offerings.  Now mind you, I have never been here before today and knew absolutely nothing about this place until walking through the door so there were no preconceived notions what so ever. 

When I arrived, there was but one employee and one customer.  Very spartan digs with some stock items on the right and the counter and kitchen on the left.  The first thing I noticed is the two women were speaking Polish.  Nice! Really? In Litchfield Park?  Knowing Russian (although not using it in too many years) it felt very familiar to me and that was quite nice.  

While waiting for their conversation to conclude, I scanned the place for some of the items on the shelves.  What I found brought me right back to the days of living in Europe back in the 80's.  An enormous assortment of products not seen since my last trip across the pond!  

When the women finished, I was greeted warmly and placed an order for something simple, a chocolate croissant.  Then to my right was a delightful looking apple tart which was screaming for me to take home so I selected that as well.  

We chatted each other up for a few minutes and then I was on my way.  Very friendly place, simple but does what its supposed to do.  High marks so far.  She even offered me a menu to take with me detailing all of their goodies. 

Upon returning home, the croissant was destined for my belly along with a piping cup of fresh coffee.  It was quite delicious and a repeat performance is needed!  

Later tonight, once dinner was completed, we tore into the Apple Tart, the other purchase made this morning. It also was exceptional!!  Memories of being at a cafe in Bavaria relaxing and not wanting to do anything but savor the moment came rushing back to me.  I'm hooked!

Dzikuj! Bd wstecz!"}
