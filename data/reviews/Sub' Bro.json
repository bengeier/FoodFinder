{"text":"Food was very good, good prices and excellent service from the staff. Located in the o2 bar which is a fun bar environment with plenty of bar games. I cery relaxed nice environment to unwind at the end of the day."}
{"text":"First i want to say that Groupon needs to state this is a bar! I took my 9 year old son there thinking it was a sub shop... Um, nope totally a bar. I'm grateful they let us stay so my money and time was not wasted, however I completely agree with Bill F. The menu looked great but was very over priced. The service was great, sweet bartender and the cook was nice. He came out to ask us how we wanted our fries and was fun to talk to. The fries were the only thing that was good to eat. The bread was WAY over toasted and the cheese was not melted at all. It seemed as if they stuck the bread in the toaster and forgot about it, then decided to just put it on the sandwich. I has a buffalo sandwich and there was more bread than meat. I wish I could sell my remaining Groupons :("}
{"text":"We came here after an AZ Cardinals game knowing this place was located inside O2 Lounge.  I'd say the food was better than \"bar food\" and I agree the service was excellent.  The chef/owner told us food would take a minute because the bread was still cooking (yeah, fresh baked)!  In between wait time, he brought out samples of the horseradish slaw and fresh sliced roast beef.  My husband had the Cuban, which is rare to find in AZ and wasn't too fatty.  I had the roast beef with horseradish mayo- super good as well.  So, if you go there knowing it is located inside a bar you'll like it- but I see why people bring kids/thinking it is a sub shop were disappointed."}
{"text":"I first walked into this place and didn't even realize they served food. Very friendly people I actually had the cook come out himself to ask me specifically how I wanted my food. Service was great and the bartender was nice and on top of her game. I haven't come to this place for evening happy hour drinks or anything but I'd recommend this place to anyone for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Chicken digits golden fried to perfection, natural cut fries have a sweet kick and fried PBJ is a must try..You won't believe how good it is."}
