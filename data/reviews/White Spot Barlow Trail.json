{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat by far!! The servers are always great, they are quick and efficient. The food is awsome. I have never had a bad meal from the menu. Their burgers are the best I've ever had. They have yummy butter chicken that isn't too spicy. The dry ribs are pretty tasty too. It's a good place to go with a large group or even just you and a date. I recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Growing up on Triple O's in Vancouver nice to see the White spots in Calgary stick to the same format and recipes. Now my grandchildren can experience the pirate pack like I did."}
{"text":"I visited on a Tuesday evening while in town on business.  After scouring the area for a good and modern looking restaurant, I came across White Spot and decided to lean on Yelp for some insider knowledge.  The meal was quite good, which consisted of a BBQ burger, fries and slaw.  The decor was right in line with what I like in a restaurant too.  I'm only giving 3 stars because my server had the personality of a dish towel.  I made it clear that I was a newcomer, yet she didn't offer suggestions on the menu or show any enthusiasm.  I would recommend White Spot, and even make a return trip if in the area again.  However, a true standout restaurant includes outstanding service both in action and personality, which was missing during my visit to White Spot."}
{"text":"Whitespot always hitting the rightspot!!!   I'm a little hesitant to write this review as I do not like reviewing restaurant chains catering for the undescriminating masses. Offering large portions of tasteless and bland food, served by equally tasteless and bland tatooed servers.  Whitespot has always been different I suppose, because I discovered it years ago while living in BC. It's always been the place I tend to gravitate towards, on those weekends when I'm travelling through a town at the wrong time of the day, trying to find a half decent place to eat.   Of course all the pretentious restaurants are closed on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, and no self respecting restaurant wants customers to be walking in at 3pm demanding a half decent meal for dinner or brunch. So our recent experience at the location (what else does one call it?) just off Barlow yielded predictable results.   An absolutely pleasant and no nonsense culinary experience. Good service, prompt attention and tasty food. My wife always orders the Butter Chicken served with jasmine rice and naan bread. Something I would never dream of eating outside a geniune Indian establishment, and I ordered a Tuscan Chicken Pasta salad which I would take chances trying in non Italian restaurants.   Verdict on both counts; great, great, great. They promote themselves as Fresh Thinking and Fresh Cooking, with fresh flavours, and generally live up to the promise and hype. I had a glass of Gabbiano Pinot Grigio with my salad and it complimented the food perfectly. So what can I say?   Go there and try their food. Even if it is not on a Sunday afternoon. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"For chains, this one's not bad, although the price range is a little higher than I expected for this type of restaurant.   The burger was very good. Poutine was a little generic, but hit the spot.  They messed up my friend's order and no fewer than five people came by to apologize. That was a little awkward, but they did drop his meal from the ticket."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner this evening. Had the double double with bacon and mushrooms. It was amazing. Cooked to perfection.  Waiter was on the ball checking on us and making sure we had refills of our drinks.  Love the food. Love the price. Love the atmosphere. Well worth it."}
{"text":"This location is FAR better than the one in the south. My husband and I have had a great meal every time we have come here (maybe about once a month). The servers are always pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Much improved: Now giving it a four-star. Service and attentiveness are now excellent. Food is close to what I expect from a White Spot. Maybe our first visit was an anomaly. In any case I would now recommend this restuarant to all the BC ex-pats (and anyone else for that matter)."}
{"text":"If you want to come in quickly to eat, dont.  The service is slow and inattentive and uninterested in their customers.  Reading other reviews it seems to be that is the consensus at this restaurant.  Slow sub par food.  A little late for dinner - I have to say that the server we had was the most aloof person ever. We were a large party and with 10-20 minutes in between visits from her the experience was drawn out unnecessarily. She made a comment about how we were her only table so we would get her undivided attention. Ask for drinks, see her again in 15-20 minutes, order a meal, see her again in 15-20 minutes, got steak with no steak knives, 10 minutes before we could ask for them. Our dining experience was almost 2 and a half hours. It would be fine if the food was extra ordinary - it was so/so. We should have gone to Perkins, they are not lazy and know how to handle a later evening crowd. If you are going in for a quick late night bite, sit in a busy area, because if you want any attention at this restaurant you have to flag someone down constantly. I will not come here again for dinner. My lunch and breakfast experiences haven't been too bad but there are better places to go - and they better step it up if they want to compete in this economy."}
{"text":"I was here a few days ago, and usual enjoyed myself. They have a winning combination here of good comfort food, warm and cozy decor, and service staff who excel at what they do.  I have given it 5 stars because i think for this type of restaurant it does what it does very well.  This restaurant chain is apparently quite popular in BC. I had never heard of it until recently. There is a woman who works as hostess server whose name escapes me but she is a real mom type....warm, welcoming and real.  The restaurant itself has an abundance of booth seating, something i definitely prefer.  Our servers name was Sidney a cheerful and efficient server,making a recommendation for me of the veggie burger which was delicious. I got some Triple O sauce on it  ( a combo of mayo and relish I was told), and served up with nice hand cut fries. The white spot offers unlimited fries... I have yet to take them up on them as I am always stuffed.  As well my burger came with thier house coleslaw....its really interesting in that it has sunflower seeds in it. I love it. Creamy, nutty, slightly sweet.  My meal including a diet coke( I am addicted to it) was 12 bucks. Service here is always great, the food is always consistent, and it is always very busy at lunch.   There is plenty of parking, and there is a small outdoor patio.   The white spot is a nice spot to enjoy a good meal, its not cutting edge cuisine, but it is damn tasty."}
{"text":"One word about this location  ... Redeemed.    For several years we've had bad expereinces at this location of White Spot but kept coming back and hoping. A little personal history on this, my family loved this restaurant as a big treat.  We have had car service, counter service and  it was always good at The White Spot.  Nat Bailey's legend lived on in his Triple O sauce on his burgers.  I still love those burgers.   Now they taste better and even though the portions are choice regulated,  4 or 6 oz burgers,  the french fries are back and so is the coleslaw.      Good going White Spot NE,  you have earned back our patronage."}
{"text":"I waited a half an hour at lunchtime for takeout food. This is inexcusable. Food tastes like the food at any other White Spot, which is decent, but not spectacular. I will not come back for lunch here."}
{"text":"Been a while since I have been to a WhiteSpot but to this location well over a year.   Restaurant does look very modern with plenty of tables for all size parties.   Menu is quite large focusing mainly on their burgers and the \"Triple O\" sauce.   I had the legendary \"Nat Hearty Brunch\" that had 2 eggs, smashed hash browns, two bacon, two sausages and half waffle with blueberries.   Delicious breakfast. Food was fresh and service was friendly.   Overall great value and decent portions."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  We went during a slow period and there were only a few people in the restaurant.  The food was really good (we stuck to the burgers) and we ordered the fries crispy, as they usually come out a little too mushy for our tastes.  The server started out being a bit crabby, but warmed up after a little while.  The restaurant was really nice, but a little too fancy... It is just White Spot after all..."}
{"text":"Review #13 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  Three words always come to mind when I think of White Spot....Triple O Sauce.  Yup this was a very popular hang out back in my Vancouver Days specifically for anything that could be slathered with the Triple O Sauce.    Surprised was I when White Spot arrived in Calgary a couple years back since it had probably been over 15 yrs since I'd eaten at one.  And so it was time to go back for some Triple O Sauce to see if the memory matched the taste.  We decided to meet hubs after work and grab a bite to eat.  It wasn't super busy when we arrived and the kids were happy they could order Pirate Packs..with the food arriving inside the pack.  Food came quickly and service was great.  It was definitely burger time for the grown ups.  I ordered the Legendary burger with cheese and hubs had a Bacon Cheddar burger.  Fries and coleslaw rounded out our meal.  The Triple O Sauce lived up to it's namesake from long ago.  Without a doubt it's a decent tasting burger that can hold it's own with the sauce in a City of Burger joints.   The kids enjoyed their chicken and mac/cheese (they share meals) and everyone left feeling happy & full.  It's good, it's reliable and it's family friendly.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  Very pleaseant retaurant, very clean and well decorated.  You have the feeling your in a fine dinning restaurant with the feel of the decor.  We were asked if we minded sitting in the lounge which was a nice atmosphere.  The place was fairly quiet last night so they needed to spread out the few dinners and I'm glad they did.  Lisa was our server/bartender, she was outgoing and friendly and had a great sense of humor.   We had some drinks and both of us ordered the halibut with me enjoing the burger with fries and my husband enjoying the fish and a ceasar salad.  The fish was nice and crisp and hot.  The fries where nice big chunky cut fries which are my favorite and of course I had triple O sauce on the side to dip my fries.  The ceasar salad was refreshing and the dressing was not too heavy which made the salad light.  It was a very pleasant meal and we really enjoed it.   I recommend this place if your looking for a nice meal for some good burgers with the family. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty quieter but it was before 5PM when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating so we decided on a booth that was closer to the kitchen and washrooms.  It was likely the manager who seated us and the waitress came by to get our drink orders soon after.  Perhaps she came in from her other job as a clown judging from her lipstick and demeanour.  She seemed a little flaky throughout the evening but did get our orders correct and refilled our drinks.  I felt like I was eating all day and night while in Calgary so I decided to have the bbq chicken flatbreak from the appetizer section of the menu for $9.49.  It was bigger than I thought with 5 pieces of bread with chicken, onion, cheese, and a dusting of cilantro.  The bbq sauce was added on top.  I would have liked less bbq sauce and more cilantro.  The bread was baked and had some crispness to it which I liked as it wasn't as doughy as regular pizza crust and thicker than thin crust pizza.  Maybe if I was more hungry, I would have enjoyed my meal more.  I would give Whitespot another try and order a main dish next time."}
{"text":"If looking for traditional \"meat and potatoes\" meal, it's hard to go wrong with your family or older parents at white spot.  Kids love the \"pirate Pak\""}
{"text":"I would give them five stars but some times when i come here the service is really slow. And some times its really good! I just hate coming here for lunch because they always take way too long  Other than that, the good is REALLY good. Their burger are awesome and they have some decent gluten free options.   The triple o sauce is awesome"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my family , nice atmosphere and pleasant staff. Food was just ok , nothing special. Found the choice very limited . Don't think it's a place we would go back to ."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant.  It's a tad bit more upscale than the usual diner (i.e. Denny's) but still has that home cooked feeling.  The White Spot has no affiliation with the White Spot from the 80's and early 90's that were around town.  These guys are a US chain.  Our server was fast, friendly and courteous.  She ensured my wife's food was nut-free (allergies).  The burgers tasted great.  Their \"O\" sauce is one of the best burger sauces I've ever had.  I highly recommend their burgers.  Their fries aren't too bad, a bit undercooked in my opinion.  However, they aren't drenched in salt so that's a good thing.  Free refills on fries."}
{"text":"Not the greatest burgers I've had. They're ok. The main reason for only 3 stars was that the calamari appetizer was pretty bland and really small portion for 10.50!"}
{"text":"Reasonably good for a chain, but nothing particularly exciting about this location.  Main problem is waiting time - never fast. Interior decor is also on a bit worn side.  Food is decent, however - though pricey for what it is (common and average bar-kind fare, yet without shining bar-wise). Think burgers with a few extra dollars for a topping.  Ok as a business lunch spot, though for a decent dinner I would rather go Earls just across the road - spending a bit more for extra comfort and variety."}
