{"text":"My family eats there all the time it is hard to find a good wholesome place to eat! the wait staff is AWESOME! we walk in and the waitress is ready is getting our drinks and pretty much knows what everyone is going to order and we have pretty much tried everything on the menu but we have our FAVS!!!!!!!!!!! I can't just pick one thing  off the menu to talk about because it is all good try it for yourselves we will keep on going back..... the food is good and prices are good and the great wait staff"}
{"text":"We ordered online and got the kung pao chicken and orange chicken along with cream cheese rangoons. It arrived a lot faster than we were expecting, and the person who delivered it was very friendly. The portion sizes were not bad either. The cream cheese rangoons were divine, and the kung pao chicken was pretty good too. The orange chicken had a good flavor, but it was a little on the dry side and a quite chewy. Overall, I will be ordering from this place more often."}
{"text":"Our first time ordering from here and it has been great, the order was perfect. We called in and it delivered and what a great place. Food was perfect, hot, and very tasty. We just found our new China's food restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The shrimps are big! I don't have no complaints the owners are also very nice!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and they have excellent service. But I will never order from this restaurant again... I ordered the wonton soup only to find dozens of tiny bugs in the broccoli. It's disgusting. I ate one piece of it so I'm positive I ate a mouthful of them. Like I said the food is delicious, I've ordered from them many times. But this is a bit much..."}
{"text":"Yum, the food is delicious and the price is right..  we take most out of town guests there for that reason.  Frank, the owner, knows how to keep you coming back, plenty on your plate!!  The food servers are personable and remember your favorites, like beansprouts in a dish that normally don't have them, and a knife for me! .  We call ahead when there are more than six of us, which is often.  thanks , Frank, Anna, and Melissa for grat food and good service!"}
{"text":"Not a good service, they serve  me the wrong  order.  We drive  back  to obtain  the right  order, and  the  cashier  gets upset  at us, and  started  arguing  with  us, instead  of  helping  us. I suggest  you to please  treat every single  customer  with the same respect."}
{"text":"We decided to have delivery at home. It was our first time trying them out. We were not disappointed at all. Our son is a picky eater so finding something that he enjoyed eating is a huge plus. Having food that he wants seconds of is even better! The price was fair and the food taste great! We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Before moving to Las Vegas, I had a favorite take-out Chinese place that cooked the food on the spot, three teeny-tiny tables, and a service window. The food was always awesome and had been there for at least 35 years. You had to wait a long time for your food, but it was worth it. Coming to Vegas and looking at the Yelp reviews, I just didn't have the heart to try somewhere else and be disappointed.   Finally, my craving for egg foo young got the better of me and I singled out Tasty China because of the reviews and it was only four miles away. What a great choice! We ordered pork foo young, house fried rice, eggplant tofu with garlic sauce, and sweet and sour pork. First, the portions are more than generous. The size and abundance of the key ingredients were a surprise. The egg foo young may have been twice as big as what I was accustomed to. The shrimp in the house rice was whole, not cut-up pieces. The tofu had to be cut before popping into the mouth. I was initially disappointed in the sauce that came with the pork foo young. I was used to a gravy and this sauce was more of a broth. However, after I got past my pre-conceived notions, I found the sauce to be much more flavorful than a gravy. Will I be back? Guaranteed!   Criticisms? Two: The sweet and sour pork need some heat (as in chilies or the like). The Eggplant Tofu needed more garlic. Both dishes, while tasty, need some kick. At home, I added some sriracha (chili oil may have been a better choice) to the sweet and sour, but didn't know how to make the eggplant more garlicky without actually cooking some and losing the point of take-out."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery and they when I called they failed to mention that they charge for delivery and when I said thats fine they all of a sudden said that I was too far for them to deliver but according to yelp they are only less then 2 miles from me...I will never order from them again lying asses"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place.  I've been passing Tasty China for awhile now, but my family and I tried it on Fathered Day and it was delicious.  The portions are generous and \"tasty\".  We'll be back there again..."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I live 10 miles away and order take out whenever possible. Hands down best chinese I've had in town yet!"}
{"text":"Really good sweet and sour chicken for lunch. They were busy but still gave good service. I love to come here"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant I have found on Craig Rd. I am very specific about what Chinese food I eat, and they are the only place so far that makes shrimp with lobster sauce the way I like (or at all). My kids rave about the fried rice, no matter what meat is in it, and my husband cannot get enough of the beef and broccoli. The service is always excellent, and everyone that works at the restaurant has a great personality. This is probably the only Chinese restaurant we will go to while we live here."}
{"text":"I called in to order for pick-up and the owner took my order. I ordered 2 meal of lunch special for pick-up and he told me there will be $1 more charge for soup containers. Never mentioned on their menu and I had never asked to charge more for to-go soup containers from any other Chinese restaurants. However, Tasty China has their own website for online orders and online orders CAN NOT CHARGE EXTRA for to go soup containers. Do not call in for orders, they will charge you for to go soup containers. I came home and opened the bag and there was no egg roll for both meals. I called them back and they told me to come back to their restaurant to get my 2 egg rolls. It was already too far and I didn't want to waste my gas. General tso chicken was ok but Chicken with garlic sauce came with 3 little pieces of meat and bunch of veggies. Chicken with garlic sauce needs to change its name to\"Veggies with garlic sauce (3 little chicken pieces included).\" One of the cheap and stingy Chinese restaurants!! Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best Chinese food I've had. I ordered the Singapore Curry Noodles after seeing a picture on Yelp. The price was more than reasonable considering you can feed two people with a single order. The dish was great, every bite was full of curry flavor without the dripping sauce mess. Plenty of Shrimp, pork, and chicken in every bite. This place is great for a sit down or to go. Will definitely come back when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I Love there Orange Chicken lunch. The service is great. The lunch special is very well priced and if you are a regular, the waitress remembers what you eat."}
{"text":"I ordered Mongolian chicken, never tasted it before but the picture looked good. It smelled yummy When I opened container, small portions, but from the moment I put it in my mouth, it was heavenly!  It was so good, did not add any seasoning, just inhaled it! Thank you so much. Will order again &  Recommend to anyone!  Just ordered again today, will see if it's as good The second time around!  Ordered Mongolian chicken & Mongolian beef & General Tso shrimp to share with visiting family. Yummy for your tummy. It was \"Ono \" as we from Hawaii say. Recommend to all! People are very nice there & delivery was quick! Thank you!   Today 5/6/16  General sao's Chicken & GS prawns. Both again small portions. But the food was sooo good.  Staff as \"usual\" were very nice, delivery was quick. What more can you ask for? More food for your money. I would recommend to anyone. If you want good food & great service, order here!"}
{"text":"Great Egg Foo Young!!! And love their Tai Iced Tea! The staff is always very friendly! Very Family style!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews & thought it was going to be great, but were very disappointed. The orange chicken was so unbelievably rubbery, it didn't even taste like chicken. Furthermore, the mushu pork tasted fishy. I don't know if it was just a bad night for the chef, but the inedible food is enough to keep us away."}
{"text":"It is wonderful! The service was very quick and helpful, the egg drop soup hot and fresh! We got there in between lunch and dinner and it was empty but the food was fresh! Great pepper steak and brown rice!!  Will get there. The next time I am I Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from work my brother was in town for trade show and got sick so he wanted War won ton soup after reading reviews I decided to order a few more items. Mongolian Beef, beef and broccoli, Hunan chicken and Chicken chow mein.  The chicken chow mein had nice big pieces of all white chicken.  Very Fresh and reasonably priced. It was a matter of convenience but so glad I stopped by.  Think I found a new favorite.  The war wonton soup with a side of spicy sauce got my brother back on track just what the Dr. ordered.  Will definitely be stopping by soon on way home to try some other items."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and authentic. Highly recommended! We we dined in and asked for a to go meal to bring to someone at home. Perfectly timed and arrived home with a hot meal. Looks like a family business."}
{"text":"I am not a picky person but food really taste bad, the meats are not fresh, too much soy sauce and oil in everything. The only good thing is the portion. But what can you do with big portions if the dishes taste bad?"}
{"text":"The food from this restaurant was VERY flavorful. I had some of their fried rice, tofu with vegetables and sautéed Asian greens. Honestly, I've never had any of those I mentioned taste SO good. The sauce they used on both entrees were amazing. Not too bland, not overly seasoned, it was just right. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. I actually reheated the same food the next day and the vegetables still had great texture and not mushy. I only rated it 4 stars because the servings were small. I'll definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"This Chinese place is so good . My grandmother just told me to eat a cream cheese wanton . Ugh . Barf in my mouth. Tried one and I'm in love I used to hate them now I don't want the taste to go away .  Today I tried the hunan chicken , fried rice, egg roll . I am surprised there wasn't much of a description but I took a risk and great sauce . I'm taking the peppers and eating them . Hunan chicken includes broccoli , water chestnuts , red bell peppers, green peppers , peas , and onion . Worth getting next time but didn't beat General Tso ."}
{"text":"Really bad food, I called in advance to ask how the chicken chop suey was prepared and I was told it had cabbage, bean sprouts and celery in it, which was what I was hoping for, when I got there and placed the order I asked if it was mild or spicy, I was told I had a choice of medium or spicy, I ordered medium, what I ended up with was bland, rubbery chicken with broccoli, celery, bean sprouts and zucchini, no cabbage, and what's up with the zucchini, I guess it was on sale,I also ordered, sweet and sour pork, it was rubbery, and grease logged, the vegetable egg rolls were also grease logged,nothing tasted fresh, really bad food, your better off eating at panda, it's not authentic but it's consistent and fresh."}
{"text":"Ambience - traditional, super clean, non-smoking and quiet.  Allowed BYOB   Food - absolutely delicious.  Had the wonton soup with everything in it; the royal shrimp; and the veggie fried rice.  So fresh and well-prepared.     Context - 30-somethings on date.    If you care about attitude the Music choice could be more contemporary.  It was like a gentle lullaby on a music box playing in the background.      Waitstaff - kind and attentive  Overall rating - 5/5. Solid.   Happy customer."}
{"text":"This place not only has the best food but the best service! They're always sweet,  professional, and quick!  Wouldn't go anywhere else. I tell everyone that lives in this area about this place. It really is tasty.  Janiece"}
{"text":"First time - food was great.  Hot and delivered quickly.  Best shrimp ever...my husband loved his chicken too!  Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week because I love their orange chicken. Friendly customer service and tasty food!  I have been coming here for about six months and the food and service is consistently great!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife wanted to try something new so we can across this place because we love orange chicken. The orange chicken was amazing, nice tangy flavor & crispy. I also got the chicken egg foo young and that was great too. Nice big portions that didn't break my wallet. Services was great the staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Tasty China is the BEST! Have ordered delivery several times via the Eat24 Yelp app, which is very convenient. The food arrives within the estimated delivery time and is HOT and DELICIOUS! I've had the chicken chow mein, orange chicken and lemon chicken, and all have been TASTY indeed! Will be ordering again for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome Service. Food is Good. And they give you large size portions. My only go to for real Chinese food ."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this restaurant has a four star rating. We ordered the combination chowmein, shrimp fried rice,  general tso chicken, Mongolian beef, and veggie chop suey.  The Mongolian beef, and chicken were okay.  The chowmein was very soggy and disgusting. The shrimp fried rice lacked flavor and shrimp.   Nevermind the food, the owners are stingy and lack customer service.  We asked for chili oil, and they gave us two tiny cups.  We asked for another two as we were feeding 6 people.  The lady refused and said she would only give us one more.  That is horrible customer service, imo.  No way are we going back to this place for Chinese.  I never thought I'd say this, but China a go go is waayyy better."}
{"text":"My wife and I go there now and then. The food is always good and plentiful. The service is great, very friendly people. We highly recommend Tasty China."}
{"text":"I've passed this place everyday going home and never gave it a chance until now. I have to say that they were better than I expected. The to go order was packed in black close lid containers which I loved. No messes to be had. The food was good. We ordered the family meal #1 with orange chicken and the beef dish and it was indeed tasty. It didn't lack flavor and I would order this again. I'm glad I gave this place a try."}
{"text":"This place was definitely some of the best chinese food I've had. We got the Family Dinner Special B with orange chicken and beef and vegetables. The service was quick and our waitress was great! Everything was delicious, especially the wonton soup. We got 2 pots of tea for only a dollar each too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in Vegas who's craving chinese. The only thing is that it was pretty quiet when we got there because there weren't a lot of people. Some music or something over the speakers would have been nice.  Overall, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Everything was fresh and tasty. Still hot by the time i got home with it. Hot and sour soup was delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best hot and sour soup anywhere. Reasonably priced as well.  Wait staff are very pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Ordinary American Chinese restaurant. I had potato beef lunch special and my boyfriend had honey ginger chicken which its basically orange chicken with some ginger sauce . Food taste OK like any other Chinese place, but this place is close by and lunch price is reasonable, waitress spoke more English than I expected, that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food on this side of town. They use a higher quality of ingredients than others in this area. Food is always fresh and has good flavor. The restaurant is nice, but it is primarily a take out place. The pics tell the story, Cupcake."}
{"text":"Great Food!! The food here is absolutely delicious.   The portions are family dinner style, sharable plates instead of individual meals; and the General Tso, Lemon Chicken, Egg Corn Flower soup, with side of white or fried rice was delicious and more than enough for 3 people.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was welcoming; and the neighborhood seemed like a safe area, even at night.  If I lived in this neighborhood, I would make this my \"go-to\" Chinese take out"}
{"text":"The Owners Son Commented On My Review Lol I Can't Check Prices If The Phone Is To My Ear Trying To Place An Order Smart Guy... I Guess I Had To Hang Up And Study The Menu When All You Had To Do Is Answer One Question To Make My Order Complete ...   I Eat Out Every Other Day And  I Don't Know If The Food Is Good Or Not But Definitely Not Spending My Money At A Place Where They Hang Up On A Customer Because They Didn't Have Time To Answer A Question About A (As In One)  Price For Something I Was Just Getting To Make My Order $15   Another 1Star For Being A Smart Guy Lol"}
{"text":"After scouring yelp for a Chinese restaurant, we decided to try this one out because they delivered to our area.   Everything seemed typical as far as proving and food offerings, so I got our usual items. The gentleman told us it would be about 50-60 minutes but it arrived in 40, which was great! Everything smelled awesome, it was hot, and ready to eat!   We ordered chicken wings, which I did not know were coated with spicy, but they were delicious! Our won ton soup which was flavorful and had a good mixture of veggie to won ton.  We also ordered orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and beef with broccoli. The orange chicken was well done with just the right balance between spice, orange and sweet. The Mongolian beef was very spicy, just as hubby wanted, but still had great flavor! The beef with broccoli was pretty good too.   Normally hubby is a very picky eater when it comes to Chinese take out, but he was quite pleased.   TL; DR- arrived fairly quick, very tasty. 8/10 would order from again!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 starts if I could! The food is SOO good and fresh. Try the General Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice,  wonton soup and the list goes on. Even the presentation is wonderful. I've ordered maybe 4 times so far since I've just found them and the last time I called at 9:40p they close at 10p, I asked if it was too late to order and the gentleman who picked up reassured me it was perfectly fine. I must admit I was hesitant to call because typically when you call late the food may taste not so great but I was WRONG. This place has consistency and awesome customer service. The delivery guy is so friendly and always delivers with a smile, just a great establishment. Lastly I will say I'm NOT a Chinese food fan. My husband loves it though so I give in every now and again. We are from NY so Chinese food is hard to beat and we've only found one other place out here that is BOMB.COM. We found this place on yelp, read a few reviews and gave it a try. I Dont regret it and you won't either."}
{"text":"we have tried limited items but their egg foo young is soooo good the chow mein is yummy great fried ship and the soups all good     its a gem hidden in NLV   large menu something for everyone..."}
{"text":"Wow salt and pepper pork chops spicy number 10!!!!! So good. They really do have the best orange chicken too. When your kids say tasty China, then you know."}
{"text":"Great local Chinese delivery place. Very friendly staff, nice packaging on the food, and reasonably priced. The food itself was well prepared and flavorful, although it's still just your standard Chinese stuff. Will be eating there again though."}
{"text":"This was an order from AZ to Vegas for our a family member. They said the food was awesome,hot & they will be going there soon. We ordered egg rolls, war won ton soup & chicken lettuce wraps. He said it was all delicious. Thank You"}
{"text":"The food really was tasty! I love Chinese, it is one of my go to comfort foods (well so is bbq. lol) And this place not only is delicious, but the prices for a family of five are great! We got the family deal B and had plenty for us to share! The orange chicken actually tasted the way it is supposed to taste, the dishes were presented with these cute flowers that looked made out of a vegetable, and the fried rice was some of the best I have had in a while.The soup was amazing, I could have just gotten that and would have been happy. The portions were perfect for a big family like mine, and we even had enough to take home with us! The waiter was very attentive and super nice, she was always on top of our drinks and taking our plates. The staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh, you can tell it just came straight off the stove. In Vegas there are plenty of places you can go for Chinese, but I would recommend anyone to go here cause they make you feel like family and their food is very good! Thank you for always give us a great experience!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in North Las Vegas!!! This is my go to spot when I am craving excellent quality Chinese food. They have the best War Wonton Soup and my kids and I love their Shrimp Chow Fun. Everything is So Tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Not a review (yet), but a question. Do you serve NY style egg rolls? The type that are larger in size with a crispy shell. I'm not a big fan of spring rolls and have been trying to find these egg rolls. As you may have guessed, I'm a transplanted New Yorker."}
{"text":"Love there food!! A lot better than Grand China that use to be in that location. Great Mongolian Beef and Cashew Chicken :) Their house friend rice is really good too!!"}
{"text":"I was really hungry after a long work day and decided to order take out. I ordered Barbecue Pork, Cheese Rangoon, Pork fried rice, and Mongolian Beef. The staff said the order would take about ten minutes. The bill came to about thirty dollars.  The staff were kind and friendly. The order took about twenty minutes. When I got home, the food was at perfect dining temperature. The Barbecue Pork was tender, but a little fatty and overly sweet. The Cheese Rangoon were tasty, light, and flavorful. The pork fried rice was a tad greasy and a little bland. I make far better at home.. The Mongolian Beef was ideal, a great mix of spicy, sweet, and crunchy.  The portions were enough to feed four, so, not bad for the price overall. I would go back to try other menu items. Definitely not the place to going you are keeping to a diet."}
{"text":"A real hole I'm the wall, but it's looks are deceiving bc this place has genuine staff and excellent food. Real quick and quality Chinese food; both done in and to go."}
{"text":"Still by far the best Chinese food I've had in a long time! Everyone is so friendly and I have become a regular! The owner Frank is constantly giving us things to try that he just got from the farmers market or other fresh place. Food is wonderful (I highly recommend the wonton soup and cashew chicken) and the service is fast. I'm now a weekly customer!"}
{"text":"So i have tried a lot of chinese delivery in vegas since moving out here from back east.  Almost all of them bring you warmed up steam table crap.  finally I ordered from this place.  Everything was freshly cooked.  It was fast.  ITs like a real chinese place, not some hole with a steam table and food that has been sitting 3 hours.  You want FRESH, TASTY CHINA?  eat here it am peas approved!"}
{"text":"Great find. The food was fresh and tasty. The owner Frank is personable and cares greatly about every customer. Our server Melissa was very attentive and very polite."}
{"text":"I have ordered several time here for take-out/delivery. My main issue is the inconsistent quality in their food. Sometimes the chow mein is good, other times it is soggy, bland, and noodles overcooked. The fried rice is the same, inconsistent. Fortunately the mongolian beef has been consistently good. Crossing my fingers every time I order!"}
{"text":"Great service and freshly made Chinese food. I was not disappointed at all. A+ on the egg foo young. Yes, the owner is very hospitable."}
{"text":"It's just old school Chinese food good; like it's nothing fancy about the place but you can't go wrong when ordering take or from here; I love their Mongolian beef , wonton soup, fried shrimp, fried shrimp rice, egg rolls; everything has been good."}
{"text":"The best like every time!!! Food Service Tasty Quiet  Nice relax music Perfect place!"}
{"text":"Super rude when I called for a delivery order. Happened to be a bit on a budget at the time and asked about the delivery charge and the least expensive combo and guy on phone assumed I wasn't going to order delivery even though I told him I would & argued with me and told me driver went home then hung up...No common sense no common courtesy...no way will I give them my money!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant off strip!!! I am frequent customer and this review is overdue. I've been to many Chinese restaurants out here, and I have to say its the only one I frequent. Their ingredients are fresh and their chicken and beef quality is superior. Thanks Tasty China for staying consistent with your service, food quality and cleanliness. Grade A !"}
{"text":"I really like their fried rice. I wasnt able to go inside because my husband and sister in law were the one who wenr in to order. Fried rice good!"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant my family and I eat Chinese food at. It tastes amazing . The lunch specials are such a great price and they come with a lot of food . I usually get the sweet and sour chicken meal . The shrimp fried rice is tasty and not greasy . Thank goodness . If you have not eaten here before . You should give it a try ."}
{"text":"We frequent this place, love the food and our usually server, but tonight we had a different lady wait on us. Very rude , gave us attitude the whole time and asked if we're doing okay while her mouth is full of food and her lips smacking together. Next time we come if she's here well walk out."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. I had the orange chicken and 2 am the next morning I woke up throwing. Went to the doctor and resulted in food poisoning. Never going back. I was always suspicious about the restaurant and the food."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch recently.  Got the General Tso's lunch special. Ordered it spicy but it wasn't spicy at all(even though there were peppers added to the dish).  Corn flower soup was just ok. Service & prices are good. Will dine here again. More dishes to try !!"}
{"text":"Tasty China is amazing! Our family was looking for somewhere new to eat on Friday night and decided on Tasty China. What a great choice. The food was amazing and the service was great. We got the family dinner and could not have been more happy. The vegetables in our cashew chicken were so fresh. At one point during our dinner a man came to our table just to ask how are food was. This really showed that they care about their customers. This will for sure be our go to spot for Chinese food. We are going back for lunch today because the food was so good."}
{"text":"The sesame chicken is great. It's a locally owned place and the portions and prices are perfect. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have to say it was a 360 turn around from my first experience.  Wyne took care of my initial issue. I will definitely consider ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese takeout in North Las Vegas. The orange chicken was a good combination of sweet and spicy. I would order again but this tiem check my bag because they forgot my eggrolls last time. 4/5 for food. 3/5 for forgetting my full order."}
{"text":"The staff is always very polite and accommodating. They are friendly and sweet and the food is delicious! They are fast, but don't substitute taste in their haste!! I love this place. Plus they deliver!!"}
{"text":"I'm super picky when it comes to Chinese food. After moving to Las Vegas from California it was disappointment after disappointment finding a neighborhood favorite. My son ordered from Tasty China and had it delivered a few times, the pork fried rice had me hooked. My husband and I go here for dinner once a week, on Fridays there is a local woman selling her hand made goods. A wonderful atmosphere and awesome cuisine. I highly recommend the pork egg Foo young and pot stickers"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from me and so convenient.  I had ordered takeout in the past, but this time I opted to dine in.  The hostess was very friendly and seated us promptly. Our server took our drink order immediately and brought us fried wonton strips to nibble on. The restaurant is nice and quiet, a great place for conversation.  My companion and I ordered the veggie egg rolls, potstickers, kung pao chicken, and shrimp chow mein.  The food came out quickly (about 15 min) and very hot.  Their portions are huge! We ate at the restaurant and had enough for the following day's lunch! The veggie egg rolls are by far my favorite.  They have a crisp exterior and are full of flavor.    What I really enjoyed was the lovely server who kept coming by to check on us.  Service is so important and really helps heighten the experience.  I will be spending more time in this neighborhood eatery."}
{"text":"We enjoyed it, good food and was as quick as they promised when we came in for pick up after a busy day."}
{"text":"This has to be the WORST Chinese place I've ever been to. The customer service is EXTREMELY POOR! My family & I walked in & there was no one around. I had to ask to be seated. Our waitress completely unprofessional. She always walked away when we asked for something. She only stayed on one side of the table & kept handing me everything to pass down. In the picture below our food only stayed getting served on one side. There was only 5 of us. We never got checked up on she just sat across from us on her phone the whole time if not at the back having a personal conversation. She got up one time & just looked at us then left to the restroom. I had to slurp my drink to get her attention since she never looked up at us. By the time we were done the cashier was ASLEEP at the desk. On the other hand the food was good & filling although I HIGHLY REQUEST to NOT DINE IN!! Their dishes look like they weren't properly washed some still had grease on it. Hopefully they give better service over the phone because this was just disappointing!"}
{"text":"I have ordered twice from this place and the experience is always amazing.  The staff is so nice and helpful and the food is always great and the temp is always hot.  I love the online ordering system, it's easy to use and it's quick.  I haven't eaten inside, but it looks clean and it's always busy.  It's a great family restaurant or you can take your date here.  I'm so glad there's a Chinese restaurant like Tasty China on this side of town, they take great pride in there food and business.  Since I've been going here, I've stopped going to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I had given up trying to find a good China's restaurant in this town.  I even tried China town and highly recommended restaurant, until the day I stopped in with my two son's for a quick lunch.  We were surprised by the amount of food that is served on the lunch menu how wonderful the flavor was.  We had a very sweet waitress named Melissa who was so friendly and kind.  We have been going to Tasty China now for over 5  months and love every dish we order.  I like shrimp dishes.  The shrimp are large and very fresh, they snap when you bit into them and have a wonderful sweet flavor.  Tasty China is our whole family's favorite restaurant.  The service is always so kind and  are always happy to see us.  We love this restaurant."}
{"text":"For being in North town - this is pretty good Chinese! I have tried others around the area and this is pretty authentic.  We got the lunch special and it is reasonable priced. Great flavor and fast! Thai tea was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great place for late dinner and a movie. Came here for the first time today i loved it! Had everything reminded me of cali and god knws its hard to find good chinese food in vegas."}
{"text":"I went in here today with my grandmother and the service was excellent! The owner came by to make sure everything was ok and the servers were very attentive to our needs. Great prices for such large qualities of food. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The egg rolls and orange chicken are awesome. The beef broccoli and fried rice are really good too"}
{"text":"I've eaten in and have done take out.  The food is wonderful.  Their Orange Chicken is to die for !!  I order extra and make  frozen lunch meals."}
{"text":"My first experience with Tasty China's food and was totally impressed with the FRESHNESS and flavor of everything I chose. The Orange Chicken was the best I ever had as was the pork Lo Mein. Just wish they'd open a restaurant in Henderson. Try it."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE, POOR QUANTITY.  I ordered from this place for a second time as it is the only chinese delivery in my area.  The first time they messed my order up, they did not follow my delivery instructions, woke up my roomates by ringing the doorbell when I specifically told them to call me when the driver pulled up.  This review is written after the second delivery.  I ordered the Kung pao Triple, for 11.95 and it contained barely any meat/shrimp.  I may as well have ordered vegetables in kung pao sauce.  AGAIN they did not follow my deliver instructions by calling when they pulled up and AGAIN woke up my roomates by ringing the doorbell.  Avoid this place if you can, i just finished my $21 worth of food ( kung pao triple and 2 chicken rolls) and I am still hungry.  The quality of the food is not bad but the quantity is horrible and their customer service is non-existent."}
{"text":"Ever since moving here from Connecticut,  I've been craving the amazing Chinese food I used to get in New Haven. My favorite all-time dish has always been Singapore Mei Fun which most places don't even have on the menu. But when I wandered into Tasty China tonight I asked them if they could make it for me. It was AMAZING! The best I've had in years. This chef is the real deal. I will be coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"Everything always tastes good. The restaurant looks like a small mom and pop place and the waitresses are always very friendly. I love coming here for take out, good quality."}
{"text":"First time here and it wasn't too bad.  Service was good, people were nice. Dinner specials were good and fulfilling.  A place we would return to."}
{"text":"I came here late and had the family meal witch wasn't bad and the service was good  . Everything was freshly made and very tasty and everyone was friendly ."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gem. I've been looking for scallion pancakes for awhile and this place does them. So happy. I also had the orange chicken and fried rice. Really good. I'm going to have to come back and explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chinese places outside of chinatown!  It looks like a family owned and operated business.  The restaurant is small, but very clean.   I tried the pad thai, hong kong style pan fried noodles, and salt and pepper pork.  They did not disappoint!  All dishes are big enough to feed 3!    Other than huge portions, the prices were very reasonable.  $34 for 3 people!  I need to take people here more often!  I like pad thai less sweet, and this place had the right amount of sweetness to it.  Portion was so huge, it probably could've fed 4-5 people on a hungry day.  Hong kong pan fried noodles has good flavor very close to authentic HK pan fried noodles in chinatown.  Meat was tender and easy to eat.    Salt and pepper pork chops had some spice to it.  Crunchy, savory, spicy, and delightful.    Customer service was excellent.  Our waitress was very friendly, and the chef even came out to ask how our dinner was.  I really appreciate a good family owned business that are proud and really care about their business.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch today with a coworker. I got the Kung Pao chicken lunch special with fried rice & hot & sour soup. The soup came first; it was nice, hot, & delicious. When my order arrived, there was no fried rice & the waitress said that she would bring it. I eventually had to remind her, but she brought at least triple the regular portion to make up for it, which was appreciated. The chicken was cooked nicely and had decent flavor, but the bell peppers/onion/celery were bland and there was a weird taste to them, as if something had gone moldy. I did not see any mold though. The cabbage filled egg roll was good, but I did find it kind of odd that the workers had set up an egg-roll-making-station at a table in the midst of the diners- the cabbage was sitting on a cookie sheet with nothing covering it.  11-8-16 So, I am eating the leftovers today and everything tastes pretty good, a lot better than yesterday. So I upped the rating from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst good Chinese is hard to find on the west coast. I love Chinese and this place is convenient for me on the way home from work and always made fresh"}
{"text":"Not good like other reviewers say. 2 of our 3 take out meals weren't all eaten, then went into the trash."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Tasty China to me so when my daughter and I wanted Chinese food in our neighborhood we decided to try it. We had a great experience. We ordered shrimp lettuce wraps and eggplant shrimp. The service was excellent and the food presentation was appealing. The aroma was so good we couldn't wait to dig in. The portions were ample. We were stuffed and we had leftovers to take home. We thoroughly enjoyed our food. It was hot, fresh,  tasty and reasonably priced. The staff came over a few times to ask if everything was ok. We are from NY and are used to delicious Chinese food. This was just as delicious. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"I've tried numerous Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood and they were all adequate until now. Tasty China is an appropriate name. The fried rice was flavorful as were the egg rolls, but the honey glazed chicken stole the show. ALL WHITE meat chicken with no fat, cooked to a crisp but not greasy. The sauce was amazing! I'll be back. The only negative was the lack of alcohol.  My husband was a bit upset as he likes a beer with his meal but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"We go to Tasty China a lot. The food is prepared wonderfully and the people that work their are great!!! We often have family get togethers there and they are so accommodating!!!  Take my advice and try it. It's a jewel in the desert!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The service was excellent.  Definitely a family run establishment. The vegetables are fresh cut, the meat was lean and flavored perfectly.  Prices are average and the restaurant is definitely clean and well maintained.  I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"The chow mein was pretty oily and I was very disgusted that the fortune cookies we got seemed so old and stale. They should of thrown away then serve them to guest. Also I tipped the driver and he never ever said thank you for your business or thanks for my tip. I felt that was rude service."}
{"text":"Seriously so happy to have stumbled upon this place. My usual place closed last year and although one would think Chinese restaurants would be good here in Vegas most are terrible. This place was a true gem I ordered general tso chicken, veggie chow mien, orange chicken and beef and broccoli. Truly worth every penny. Our server was such a sweet lady. We will back back. You deserve to be voted best of las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love their shrimp fried rice with the large shrimp. I order extra shrimp and Its enough left over for the next day. It's very tasty fried rice......"}
{"text":"Pretty fresh and fast Chinese food to go. Ordered to go twice and they got my order perfect . Good portions too. A little on the saucy salty side but people love that right?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in North Las Vegas to get takeout Chinese! Their sesame chicken is really great, and they serve a large portion. My experience with their delivery drivers are that they're super polite and on time. I would definitely recommend Tasty China for both takeout and delivery!"}
{"text":"I went in there for lunch last week and had the orange chicken with fried rice. They gave me white rice, but heck, it tasted better with the white. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, music was soothing and put me in the mood to scarf down my meal. They weren't kidding about the \"best orange chicken in town\". I'm sure there's better. Way better.. In China. Satisfied customer here. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a new Chinese place and we found it. The food was super fresh and fast. The combination dinners are a great deal if you like soup and appetizers with your meal. The waitress was nice and filled our glasses when the cups were only half empty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a casual Chinese place in town and we finally found one on our side of town. We loved all the entrees we got which were Orange chicken and Mongolian beef we also had pork fried rice which was amazing. Everything was great I don't know why this place got any bad reviews this is our new place to go for Chinese food. I really loved everything. Another note was that a lot of people came in to pick up orders so it wasn't to crowded. Very clean and the waitress were very attentive. So happy with our experience."}
{"text":"First timers!  Food was delicious & plentiful. Ladies working there were delightful!  Food came hot from the kitchen. Very clean restaurant. Serve almond cookies after the meal which we haven't seen done in years--usually a fortune cookie which was also served. We will definitely return & spread the word!"}
{"text":"Very good, I ordered the hot and sour soup and steamed veggies. Everything was piping hot, so the food was delivered very fast. Yummy and tasty. Hot and sour soup was perfect and also the half order of steamed veggies was not over-cooked. I will definitely order from here again.   TASTY CHINA is really tasty:)"}
{"text":"I love their soup!! The spicy soup is so good! Anytime I'm feeling under the weather I order delivery and get that delicious soup. Delivery is always speedy and the food is always good. The orange chicken is really good and so is the BBQ pork fried rice."}
{"text":"Absolutely GOOD amazing food!!!! Consistently authentic Asian food. I've tried several Asian places (I love fried rice) and they always do it best."}
{"text":"First time at Tasty China and it was very good. Loved the amount of seasoning on each of the dishes we ordered. Interior is OK, nothing to write home about, but food is very good and service was fine. There are several healthy items you can order. The favor is not your topical heavy sauced Chinese food. Each dish was not floating in brown sauce or heavy black bean sauce. We'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"We love love this place! It's our go to especially since we live on this side of town. We have tried a lot of other different places around the area but this place is always our go to in the end. We usually order the family dinner special if we pick up. If dine in, our usuals are fried rice, chow mein, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, all of which are amazing. We'll definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant when it was called Grand China. Their food was great back then ,but when my son and I went tonight to try out Tasty China, the food was fantastic! We had wor wonton soup, pork fried rice, chicken chow mein and chicken with vegetables that we shared. They give you so much food that we had leftovers that could feed another three people. The freshly cooked entrees were so tasty and flavorful. The service was outstanding and the place is really clean and relaxing. We definitely will be back. Give this place an A+++!"}
{"text":"When we came in we were seated immediately,  atmosphere was very clean, they have so many lunch specials to choose from. We ordered cashew chicken and Orange chicken.Our food arrived to us very quickly, and the staff was extremely courteous. Location is extremely convenient."}
{"text":"Im completely shocked! I have tried nearly every mom&pop Thai and Chinese food restaurant in NW and have been disappointed time after time. Tasty China is a pleasant surprise. I loved my food, very tasty and of great quality. I ordered Lettuce Wraps which were superb. The chicken skewers and the Mongolian beef best I've had in a long time. I'm definitely ordering again!"}
{"text":"Due to the wait for my delivery, I'll rate this 4 stars. But! The food arrived very hot and it's soooo good! I would most definitely order from here again. Yum! By the way, the manager got in contact with me and gave me a coupon for next time since the delivery was a little longer than expected. Thank you for bringing good food around!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, great service and reasonable price......the place is clean and nice parking lot as well. I will be back always....excellent"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to eat.  I only eat here for lunch during my work week and only when I have so much work to accomplish I want to work and eat. The driver has to be one of the friendliest people I know! When ever I call they know exactly who I am and what my order is. Several times they have included something extra for me and the food is always delicious!!  I was sad because for about 2 months my job transferred me to a location in Henderson and I was afraid I would not be able to eat here again, but I am back working in NLV and get to continue enjoying their food!"}
{"text":"My only gripe so far is that the website claims they deliver to our work, but when we tried to order for delivery we couldn't check out. We called it in and were told we are 4 miles away and have to pick it up. This needs to be changed. The food is ok. I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant that keeps me coming back. I don't recommend the egg \"corn\" soup."}
{"text":"We always order Chinese food here because it's close. Great service and the food is always cooked well. The cleanliness of inside the restaurant could be a bit more but other than that ; it's always been a good experience there for our family"}
{"text":"Let me explain here before you get too excited. I recently relocated to this side of town and have found a serious lack of good food nearby so this is quick, affordable, nice and clean and surprisingly good... For what it is lol. The reason for the generous 4star rating though is because I would give their consistent outstanding customer service 5 stars on its own.   I've had the standards like sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef, Kung pao chicken, chicken chow fun etc and they do make a very tasty Kung pao with nice measure of heat, the sweet and sour can be a little thin (runny) sometimes but I know that's a personal pref so your tastes might be different. The Mongolian beef is surprisingly good too with their beef being tender but not... Slick? You know that sheeny slickness that MB gets in most places like these lol? I'm not really sure how to describe it but this beef is better textured than most MBs. I don't think I'd try seafood there but not because it's not clean or I distrust the establishment in any way, I just know at the prices they charge, their seafood has to X amount of cheap lol and that's the part that leaves me suspect. I've had their delivery (always very fast and super courteous) and have eaten there in person. Unlike most places in the area with the big bins of food waiting to get shoved into their eagerly waiting styro's, this place actually FEELS like a Chinese sit-down restaurant. I can't stress enough how nice the staff is here too. I even goofed big time once and hit pick up instead of delivery and forgot I had my order linked to a phone number I had no access to. Since I prepaid it through Yelp, they were relentless in trying to reach ME (they blew up the phone number until they got an answer, that person then in turn reached me, etc) and insisted on bringing it to my house even after they closed!! I was so embarrassed but they were so kind and thoughtful (even including those delicious almond cookies as a treat like they do!) I was really blown away.   I've had some very fine dining before and hope to again but for a Tuesday night fix in a hurry--in any area of town but especially this one -- you really can count on these guys. Being critical, I'd put food just north of 3.5 stars but again, a solid 5 for customer service so I do feel the 4 is fair. I'm already a regular and they will genuinely appreciate your business - something that seems to be dying more a bit every day no matter what side of town you're on."}
{"text":"Wow... just, wow.  This is our favorite spot for Chinese takeout.  After nearly six years of living in Las Vegas, we finally found a place that wasn't just okay or decent, but freakin' awesome.  The staff and owners are incredibly nice, the service is quick, and the food is amazing.  What's even better is they give you the option on how spicey you would like the food to be prepared as.  The sweet and sour is the classic red sauce, but doesn't turn into a gelatinous mold after you put it in the fridge, and isn't ridiculously sweet... just right.    Favorite dish is General Tsao's Chicken, as I haven't found anyone else in town who does it better, and I mean anyone."}
{"text":"I was afraid that when my order was late, everything would be cold and greasy. This was not true at all. Everything was still hot and absolutely delicious!! I can't get enough of the chicken fried rice! Yum!!"}
{"text":"This chinese food restaurant brings childhood memories from when it was Grand China. The sweet and sour chicken is the best plate ever. Taste is amazing! Gotta give this place a try."}
{"text":"First and foremost the free Thai Ice Tea with a check in is no longer valid. The server kindly declined it after we checked in.   However, the food here is 5/5, the service is 5/5, the huge portions are 5/5, the cooking time was 5/5 and the price 5/5!! Although, it's a drive from the house it's worth it. I came with a friend who comes here often. She said the dine in is often really slow but pick up is busy. We were there for about an hour and saw countless people come in and pick up. I must add that we had a lot of leftovers and their take out boxes and soup tubberware were great. There was no spills or leaks in our bag once we got home.   The inside interior is an old school Chinese style restaurant. It reminded me of the Chinese spots in New York! However, it was very clean and cute."}
{"text":"Good food, amazing service, and really affordable prices. They have fantastic lunch specials!"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriends and mines go-to Chinese spot when we're away from Chinatown. I love to get their corn egg drop soup. It is just so flavorful. My boyfriend loves the wonton soup. He likes try something different every time we order from them, but I'm a chow fun girl. I was raised on beef chow fun as a kid, and they probably make some of the best. They're very nice and always have my order ready to pick up in 5-8 minutes, which I love because I need to get my munchies on. Their flavors are so much better than China One's that I just love ordering from here. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who just wants a simple, nice and hot Chinese meal away from Spring Mountain. They're the best as far as North Las Vegas goes!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas for 12 years, 8 of those years in North Las Vegas. I have tried almost every spot. my husband loves the Orange Chicken & I cannot get enough of their Shrimp Fried Rice. The shrimp are huge & they give you plenty! its only $9 or so & two people can eat from it. it is delicious! I recommend you try it yourself."}
{"text":"Tasty china is just that, tasty! It's your local chinese food place with great service, reasonable prices, and plenty of food to fill you up! I stopped by as my car was being worked on near by. They have a lunch special from I believe 12pm to 3pm. I got the soup( I had the wonton soup), eggroll, chow mein and sweet and sour chicken. It was all good and I was stuffed by the end. It was total of around $9 for just me which was good considering I had the wonton soup. Usually places charge more then $1 to substitute the wonton in place of egg flower. Service was good with the waiters always coming at the perfect time to refill the soda. Seems like lots of people who live in the area and work around it come for lunch.   They also do delivery and party trays from the little menu I took with me.  I give tasty china 3 stars for their good service and good food. Definitely will be returning when near by and in the mood for chinese."}
{"text":"I love this place but the woman taking the orders is a mess. They make the best food, across the board and use large fresh shrimp for the shrimp fried rice. The lady is the only reason for the 4 star rating. One time she brought our food to the table and then walked away with my daughters water, everyone was confused. Then someone from the kitchen comes back with the water and said, Is this yours? Another time I placed a to-go order and waited for about 8 minutes as she took a phone order and I told her spring rolls about 6 times with the order and she said OK. Then when I get back they are looking at me sideways saying that you did not pay for vegetable egg rolls. HUH! After I ran out to get my card with an attitude and come back in, the guy realizing that she is crazy said, NO CHARGE. They have the best fried rice along with Golden Phoenix on Losee and Centennial. Stay away from Little Dumpling and China A Go Go."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant! So happy that I live within their delivery zone now! LOVE that they use all white meat chicken!"}
{"text":"I went in to try the hot and sour soup which I order at any Chinese or Thai restaurant.  It had just the right spiciness and lots of bamboo shoots and black mushroom strips but I was disappointed that it was not sour enough.  I also like a few shitake mushrooms in it but they were missing too.  I will go back yo try the other dishes but ill grt my hot sour soup fix at The Cannery buffet which is so far my favorite in LAS."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chinese restaurants in Vegas!  Our waitress remembers us every time! Not the fanciest of places but the food is great, and the chef even modified an entree to accommodate my husband (not on the menu but he loved the Mongolian beef when he used to eat meat- chef was kind enough to make Mongolian Tofu for him now that he's vegetarian).  Keep up the great work, Tasty China!!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The Hot and Sour soup is great. The food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I live about a mile from this location and in my laziness, have ordered a couple times through the Eat24 app. This place is the bomb! I typically order the beef and broccoli or the Won Ton soup, though I've also tried their General Tsos chicken as well. Everything is flavorful and very fresh. Typically when I order Won Ton soup from other restaurants you can tell that the vegetables have been sitting in the soup for a long time because they are mushy. Not here! Love this place. The customer service is also pretty great!"}
{"text":"My family eats out regularly. We were looking for a new Chinese food restaurant and came across this Tasty China location.   We ordered the:  Egg foo Young Orange chicken General Shrimp House fried rice  House chow mien Salt n pepper Pork Chicken Wings (very over cooked)  85.00?  The food was flavorful and had a very fresh taste. Our only complaint was that the juices are not present in your chicken/pork dishes because they're being over cooked.   If it were not for the meats  being consistently over cooked we would eat at your location on a weekly basis forever."}
{"text":"Came here hungry, didn't think much of the place but you know what they say don't judge a book by its cover.. ordered the beef and green beans and it was delicious, their egg foo yung was amazing. I've had egg foo yung before and they are either oily or too saucy but this place was great! All out delicious and worth the money!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out and my order was completed so quickly! The staff are so friendly and helpful. The food is delicious and the proportions were perfect! I had more than enough for dinner and plenty of yummy left-overs. The hot and spicy soup and the chow fun noodles are my favorites. The General's chicken and Mongolian beef are also delish."}
{"text":"After three outings here, I find this place to be a top purveyor of Cantonese cuisine.  Entrees are served piping hot and are enormous.  There is always enough left over for lunch the next day.    The first two times I ate here, besides tasting great the dinners were uneventful.  But the last time, a plate topped with a piece of food gunk had to be replaced; our metal teapot filled with hot tea actually leaked profusely from the bottom of the spout and had to be substituted out; and we ordered a large bowl of Wor Wonton Soup including Shrinp to be without barbecued pork, but it arrived with tough pork slices in it anyway.  In fact, halfway through the bowl, the waitress ran frantically toward our table, saying, \"I think pork was put in your soup!\"  Not to worry--all we had to do was to ignore it.  Trying to forego the pork was not based on religion or an allergy; Diane and I just don't like rectangles of pork in soup.  The pork-filled dumplings in the Wor Wonton Soup that I consumed were actually delicious.  Thick Vegetable Egg Rolls were moist and very good, especially after being dipped in a vibrant Sweet & Sour Sauce, and average-sized Pot Stickers were good.  I found the restaurant staff to be very accommodating.  More Sweet & Sour Sauce, excellent light and crisp Soup Noodles, and knives were quickly supplied; and my request for \"off menu\" Beef with Snow Peas and Mushrooms was granted.  The dish, with light Brown Sauce, was delicious, as was Chicken Chow Mein, with medallions of white breast meat, Green Onions, & oodles of noodles.  Diane enjoyed her usual Walnut Honey Shrimp with good Honey Mayonnaise Sauce, and friends dining with us really liked the heavily battered Orange Chicken, although they thought Crispy Shrimp, which comes with small but potent Jalapenos, needed some sauce.  A hearty Brown Sauce was cheerfully provided, at no charge.    On balance, a solid 4 stars overall!"}
{"text":"I eat at Tasty China at least twice a week. Really great quality chinese food that's flavorful and satisfying. One of the issues with most \"american chinese\" restaurants is great quality food with reasonable prices and this place has both.  They are always so nice and the service is always great. I would recommend Tasty China if you are looking for traditional \"american chinese\" comfort foods!"}
{"text":"We got the orange chicken that is hyped there. It was overcooked, and therefore way too chewy. The food is about average for me, but below for my wife because she wasn't crazy about her egg-fu-yung, so we won't go back."}
{"text":"This is some bomb food. Had to pull myself away I didn't want to stop eating. For the price got more than enough food."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to get food delivery.  The delivery was quick! Food was hot!  The family meal B was economical and you can feed 4 with that!  Huge servings.  Very tasteful!  Not greasy like most Chinese places I have ordered from."}
{"text":"We're regulars here...alternating between carry out or dine in.  We started going here after our previous \"go to\" Chinese place went out of business.  After Tasty China opened, we decided to stop in and give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised to find Melissa, the hostess at the place we used to go to.  We've joked with the owner that if he ever gets rid of her, he's losing our business.  She is literally the backbone of this place, taking care of all the dine in customers by herself, without ever missing a beat.  The food is consistently FANTASTIC, with more than enough for another dinner for us.  The prices are reasonable......especially for the shear amount of food you get.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet & sour chicken and chicken chow mein. I liked how they kept the sauce on the side for me to pour it on the chicken to keep it from being soggy. They give you plenty of food."}
