{"text":"We have been to Eesti Maja Cafe many times and will continue doing so because we enjoy the ambiance, the people (mixed crowd of both Estonian and Canadian) and of course the food & drinks (full bar and non-alcoholic beverages). 

There are great dishes to choose from if you are a meat eater. Although we do not eat meat, the chefs are open minded and creative about offering non-meat options such as fried egg, with potatoes, sauerkraut & gravy! The food is  freshly prepared, and the wonderful smells is enough to make you salivate while waiting briefly for your meal. 

Our all time favorites are baked goods including: Carrot pies, Estonian Cheese Cake (which is made of cottage cheese and raisins) and Apple Cranberry pie, which is also delicious! The owner of Eesti Maja Cafe bakes these fresh every night! The baked goods is the reason that we always have a smile on our faces after dining at Eesti Maja! 

On Saturdays, Estonian House Cafe offers a Big  Buffet Brunch for a decent price of $9 for adults and $6 for kid. The food is fresh, offered in abundance and delicious, from fluffy savory eggs, potatoes & bacon to pancakes topped with fresh fruits. Hot and cold drinks are also available.

If you want a change of scene that the usual Cafe's, then try Estonian House Cafe which is suitable for a meeting or a evening with friends. Just make sure to do that before 8pm on Wednesday or Thursday nights, as it is as long the chefs are there to cook you real food! 

Wi-Fi is free, TV on location, smooth Estonian or other music is playing for the background and they also offer catering with reasonable prices.

NB! On Groundhog Day they offer AMAZING pastry with whipped cream, you just gotta try it!"}
{"text":"My co-worker once got these really yummy stuffed rolls from this cafe. They called them Pirozhki or Estonian \"perogies\" and they are awesome especially the bacon ones. They have a few other different kinds, beef and carrot. Will definitely go here sometime and try other delicious treats."}
