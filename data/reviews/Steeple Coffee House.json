{"text":"This is a wonderful place to sit back and enjoy a great cup of coffee. The atmosphere is great in an old church. The stained glass windows are beautiful. There are baked goods available and a wide selection of coffee. The owner is also really nice. This is definitely my favorite place in Monticello to enjoy a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This coffee house is a gem. The coffee is good and so are the homemade muffins/pastries!  It is overall less expensive than something like a Starbucks, but the coffee is better, the staff is friendlier, and the atmosphere is beyond charming!"}
{"text":"Good coffee not great coffee, usually made each 45 minutes but in a thermos for you to fill. Situated near the court house great place to visit with others. Many Abe Lincoln history spots within 300 yards of the location. Also the town has a steam engine train running in the summer. The expresso is good and with some of the premodern coffe you can have a high quality coffee experience.  The location is inside of an old church. Very interesting place"}
{"text":"This place has a lovely, welcoming ambiance. I walked in to the sound of local musicians quietly playing acoustic guitars together in one corner of the church, students studying, other patrons smiling and chatting. It's one big open space with the coffee bar located at the rear. The gentleman was friendly and polite. My father got a small coffee which you help yourself to from an airpot/pump thermos. He said it was tasty. They have their own fair trade (and I believe organic) beans. They had a nice little selection of what looked like fresh baked goods. Since it was a warm day I opted for a blackberry Italian soda. This was disappointing. An Italian soda to me is syrup with soda water ON ice. This was syrup blended with ice. No soda water. It wasn't terrible, but it in no way resembled what I was hoping to get. That being said, so what. So they're not making world class Italian sodas. They are making good straight up coffee in a wonderful location in a great little town. Places like this are gems."}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance to sip on a coffee or espresso.  Set in an old church, this coffee shop has a ton of character.  I ordered a double shot espresso and enjoyed it while walking around the cute downtown area. Will return."}
{"text":"Although I still like this place, they really need to switch to a different type of cup, especially considering the price. They serve espresso in a crappy Styrofoam cup if you get it to go. It seems minor but it negatively impacts the taste and experience of the espresso."}
{"text":"Perfect little independent coffee house.  Old church building and great care taken to preserve some of the beautiful elements makes for a great place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee. But it isn't just your average cup of Joe.  Expect a full range of freshly baked pastries and scones.  Also a full range of espresso  drinks and tons of Homer Soda Co  choices to round out the choices.  Comfortable seating choices with old pews, couches, chairs and tables to plop down and work on the free wifi."}
{"text":"Superb coffee in a charming church atmosphere. Nestled in heart of Monticello. Filled with irresistible baked goods sure to have you begging for seconds. My first time and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Free wifi, great coffee/tea, nice atmosphere.  What a great coffee shop for a small town."}
{"text":"Options limited in Monticello for a good cup of coffee.  Thank God that I found this place.  Amazing cup of smooth French Roast.

The gentleman working was knowledable and very kind.  I WILL BE BACK!"}
