{"text":"Too bad. Waited 45 minutes for a waffle. They served me raw dough. Disgusting. Server was nice, but the kitchen ruined it. Last time we go there. Only gave it one star because yelp made me."}
{"text":"This place was horrible...only good thing was the service 50% of the time and the clean restrooms"}
{"text":"Considering it is a \"soft\" open, the service was pretty good. Currently only open for breakfast, the Spanish omelet I had was very tasty. The staff is friendly and the attentive. It appears they will eventually have a salad bar and I'm very excited about that. Hard to find these days. Was told the grand opening will be in August. I would give it a 5th star but no dinner or menu yet. Time will tell."}
{"text":"The food was great very nice new restaurant I will definitely be back. The breakfast was really good and can't wait to come back for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Eh, where to start. Do not listen to the guy below, this place is not worthy of 5 stars. First things first...a steakhouse...that doesn't offer steak. They have such a nice logo I thought this could possibly give the other steakhouses in the area a run for their money, but no. Everything about this place was bad. From the moment I entered, there was no one in the place yet I couldn't get seated. I had to stand there waiting on a hostess. I asked where the bathroom was and as I walked through the place I noticed a bar being used as a waitress station. No bar! Who doesn't want a beer or a glass of red wine with a steak? The floors were tore up. The seats are old, dirty, and coming apart. The walls are dirty and there are a 100 holes in the wall from the previous Ruby Tuesday. They were never patched and repainted. Gross! I'm sorry you do not open your doors for business with things is disrepair and think you are going to last long. I will also add, as a lady, there was no garbage can in the bathroom stall. Not cool. Broken tiles on the bathroom walls too. Okay, so getting over the place looking like a truck stop I finally had a chance to look at the menu for lunch. I guess right now they only serve breakfast and lunch, and dinner will be coming soon. No steak on the menu, and it's a steakhouse. I asked what kind of soup they have and she said French onion and chili. Well, the French onion was already their \"signature soup\" and chili is not really a soup. So the menu really didn't offer any soup choices. I got the salad bar, and a cup of French onion. My husband got a burger, potato salad, and mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. The waitress (who was nice, but not very good at her job) said \"Oh usually the burgers take a really long time to make, but it seems like they are cooking a little faster today.\" My husband and I looked at each other and kind of raised our eyebrows. The salad bar wasn't bad, but there wasn't much on it to really justify a bar. They could just make that in the back because it was very small. My husband and I sat there waiting forever for one burger and a cup of soup, just staring at the dirt and holes on the wall. Finally the waitress runs out with two plates of food, that were not ours. Then about 10 minutes later he gets his burger and cheese sticks, and still no cup of soup for me. Meanwhile our dirty salad plates are piling up on the end of the table and the waitress even looks at them, and never clears them. They were still sitting there when we left. Keep in mine there is only a total of 3 to 4 customers in the whole place so it's not like anyone is busy. I waitressed for many of years, so I know bad service when i see it. If this place survives, they need to train their staff better. My husband said his burger was \"alright\" and my soup was alright. His potato salad was gross, it was like mashed potatoes with potato salad ingredients. Kind of reminded me of baby food. So much for enjoying a nice steak at lunch, we will never be back to this place and no doubt in my mind....they will not be in business very long."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! I was in the mall and had planned to go to lunch so I stopped to look at the posted menu. The hostess was nice and ended up convincing us to try it out. I noticed that all of the furnishings are still the same as what was there years ago from Ruby Tuesdays. There was a salad bar with no salad and a bar with no alcohol. All tables, chairs and booths were the same from years ago. There was also a strong odor in the restaurant that I could not make out. It seemed like it could have been some type of glue or paint.  The first table we were seated at was so wobbly there was no way anything would have stayed put. My daughter and I decided to share something because we were already a bit unsure of the place. We ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza and 2 waters. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally about 20 minutes later our server came over and said she was going to see what was going on. She came back and said it would be out in a minute and a half. Five minutes later \"Sonny\" came over and said he was going to see what was going on. He came back and said it was on it's way out. Finally about 5 minutes later it showed up. It was not a pizza, there were several pizza shaped pieces piled on top of each other on a plate. The \"crust\" seemed like it was some type of cracker bread. It had bottled BBQ sauce on it that was so thick it was pouring off, most pieces had one piece of chicken on them but some did not have any. The cheese was in a big thick pile on top and wasn't even really melted. I took one bite of it and decided that we needed to leave. In total we had waited 30 minutes after ordering for an unpizza that was awful. Sonny was at the door when we walked out. he asked me what was wrong. I told him how the food was and he proceeded to tell me that they had already had several cooks quit. It was day 3 of their soft opening! He said that if my daughter and I come back again that he will buy us breakfast but IF this place even stays open we will not return."}
{"text":"I had a Reuben and my wife had the BLT. Very presentable and tasty. Reminder- a soft opening means they may not have everything and it might not be 100% perfect. I think the other reviews are a little harsh. I like the food, the service, and the menu. Very affordable. I'll be back again and look forward to the full grand opening. Would be an affordable date night. They have some things to work on as far as look of the Restaurant, wobbly tables, probably would move the salad bar so it's not in the front. TVs are a nice touch but be careful with how many there are, this isn't a sports bar. It's a date night, family place."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast/lunch and had the country fried steak.  Pretty good!  The potatoes were great too.  Service was very friendly albeit a little inexperienced.  The prices were VERY reasonable- my wife, mother in law and me ate for $35.  Good place for a bit to eat that isn't fast food but won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We ordered a kids chicken tenders and we hit frozen chicken tenders that were extremely breaded and store bought French fries. When we told them that our daughter didn't like the chicken they took the plate away and then charged us the full amount. When we questioned having to pay for the food, they offered a 50% discount and said they \"did have to pay and cook the food.\""}
