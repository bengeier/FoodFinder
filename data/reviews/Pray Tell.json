{"text":"In a city of mind blowing cocktails, pray tell not only keeps up but leads the way in gorgeous, delicious and well mixed drinks. The bar tenders are all incredibly fast and talented. The food is IMPECCABLE; approachable gourmet versions of your favourite comfort food (here's lookin at you pizza pocket)."}
{"text":"I love going to Pray Tell because there is so much live entrainment every week. the people that go there are upscale nice people. The place rocks on Fridays and Saturday, get there before 10:00 pm because if you don't expect a long line to."}
{"text":"Go go go! Wonderful space, great cocktails and food, and super friendly staff. The interior is warm and welcoming, much like the staff. I rarely recall names, but our server, Victoria, was kick-ass - she had a great energy and humour, all while taking the time to guide us through the menu of cocktails and food. I think we ate and drank just about everything.  Standouts were the king cold roll, crispy dumplings, steak tartare and, of course, the pizza pockets. Cocktails were deftly created and a little too tasty...good thing water was constantly topped or the next morning could have been much worse. Pray Tell is a fantastic addition to College Street and I look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch on Saturday. The food was light and fresh. I had the short rib benny, it could have used more short rib in it. I also like when places make their own hot sauce or ketchup but this place doesn't. The decor is lovely. I would come back to try their tapas."}
{"text":"Went there for a Saturday brunch. Firstly, let's just say that the interiors are what I imagine my sunroom to look like. That is if I ever buy a house in this crazy housing market. But a girl can dream.   Now to the good, no great, stuff - the food is spectacular. We got pretty much everything off the menu, except regretfully, the bottomless mimosa. The best thing on the menu was definitely the French toast and maple pork belly, both of which can also be ordered as a side, so yay! The lemon zest on the avocado toast is divine. They even made the lettuce taste better.   The servers are great and friendly. The place is a tad bit overpriced for the quantity, but certainly worth the buck."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one week night with a friend. They have cool decor and fancy drinks. I really liked the pizza pocket. My only complaint was a small menu, and the dumplings we had were average. We also ordered the charcuterie board, which was ok. I'd like to try some of the larger plates another time. Service was good. It's a nice casual place for some snacks and good drinks."}
{"text":"Charming from the get go with it's decor. I was stumped between two choices on the menu, the burrito and the short rib benny. Upon inquiring with our LOVELY server which was the better choice, she insisted I get the short rib benny. And let me tell you, I could kiss her! It's truly one of the best brunches I have ever had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pray Tell is the Perfect example of these restaurant i called Insta-Rant. Instagram Restaurant  Its all about the look and making sure you have great photo of your brunch.  The space, drink and food is all Eye-catching, Sprinkled, colourful but have nothing to please your mouth.   Its to wonder if this recently nominated chef ever sat down for a meal with the manager from start to finish and realise the lack in execution, flavours and the gap of quality.  The pizza pocket thing was quite bready, a disgusting ball of dough covered in sauce and the waffles have nothing special so why not throw some cake decoration on them.   Overhyped and only good for your instagram fame and snapchat audience..."}
{"text":"Came to Pray Tell, frankly, to look at the plants. Got a great dining experience and delicious food!   The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Even though it looks like a pretentious brunch place, the staff were anything but. I would say that the brunch menu is somewhat limited, hence the one star off. I got the one menu item that I wanted to try so I don't think I would come back here for brunch (I always like to try new things).   I got the pork belly benny and bf got the noodle bowl. He didn't love the noodles that came with the bowl, which were vermicelli noodles but I'm sure the restaurant considered intolerance to gluten in their choice. He said the chicken was well seasoned and the half spring roll was good. My pork belly benny was great- the pork belly wasn't too fatty at all. Salad was crisp and the dressing was sweet-ish but I couldn't quite place the flavour."}
{"text":"I recommend this place anyone going to the Paint Lounge as it's in the same area. We stumbled there with my friend everything was pretty good, from decor to drinks and to food. It's more of a tapas place and can get a bit pricy but the ingredients seem to be high quality and I wasn't disappointed with my dishes. It looks like they regularly change the menu as some of the dishes we tried aren't on it anymore. Next time gonna try brunch!"}
{"text":"Mr.H found this place and I'm so glad that he did. It's always hard to find a bar where you get great drinks as well and great food. Here, I was able to find both! The food was absolutely outstanding and every single thing starting for apps to share plates were fantastic. We had the Roasted Garlic, Cheezy Bread, Braised Ribs and Pork Dumplings, every single item was amazing!  For drinks we tried the Old Fashioned, Make Nice, the Rural Juror and End of the Road. My absolute fav was the Rural Juror (it's sweet) and Make Nice.   I totally recommend trying this place out! You can thank me later ;)  PS: A special shoutout to Hal for her amazing recommendations and service!"}
{"text":"Good music, beautiful decor, great service & no line up for brunch  The yogurt parfait was AMAZING. The spiced nut granola & creamy water buffalo yogurt was the perfect balance between sweet and savoury."}
{"text":"Pizza pockets were yumm! And cocktail (play nice) was spot on. Cute decor, great vibe. But go for drinks and snacks. Don't come hungry. Will have to try their brunch next time!"}
{"text":"So excited to see one of my all-time favourite Toronto bartenders, Danny, is there.  You know then the cocktail list will be good.  Fun selections, strong drinks, always a good mix.  We didn't eat but most things sounded appetizing AF, so will be back to eat AND drink.  Seats were high top (not all the seats, just the ones we sat at) but they were not uncomfortable at all, which is a rarity.  Had the \"Robert California\", it was super drinkable and interesting, lots of different flavours there, including cinnamon and some weird maraschino liquor (fabuloso or something...).  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pray Tell is a tiny restaurant filled with plants and green, and it makes me really happy.   I came here for brunch on a hot summer day, and I can definitely see myself coming here for a night out. The atmosphere and the hipster and chill vibe is just something I don't experience as much as I want to. The only pictures I have of this place are the walls because they are just seriously so pretty!!   I can't actually remember what I got. I think it was The Prayer, but whatever I ordered, it wasn't bad. Yes, a bit overpriced for the amount of food you get, but I really liked the ambiance of the place.    I will be back again for their drinks and snacks for sure. Apparently their cocktails have some sort of Scandinavian style, so we'll see how that goes.                                                                                                                                                                          TLDR; Overpriced brunch, but nice naturey/chill/hipster vibe. I like naturey/chill/hipster kind of  vibes."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite spots.... they recently changed the chef and the menu... the new menu is very boring."}
{"text":"Incredible brunch.. just when i thought brunch couldnt get better ! Dishes that go beyond just a benedict or french toast, intricate taste !"}
{"text":"AMAZING.  One word to describe this place. Everything was delicious and service was great.  Came here with my partner around 12am on a Saturday and the ambiance was calming and wonderful with the nice dim lighting where it was still bright enough to see the menu.  Ordered the pizza pocket supreme (twice), cheesy bread, chicken parm sammy, dumplings, braised short rib and steak. (We eat a lot for two, don't we??) everything was delightfully flavourful.  Cocktails are amazing and pair exceptionally well with the food. (Ordered \"big bud\" cocktail .. can't remember the name.. a really sweet cocktail; if you're into that.)  Definitely a recommend to all if you like cocktails and delicious snacks.   Ps. Sorry for no pictures. It was all so compelling to eat and totally forgot about the camera."}
{"text":"All style no substance. Went there for brunch this morning. The decor is on point with all the right looks for social sharing in 2018 (read: loads of plants). But a bunch of likes is about all this place seems to be good for (at brunch, anyhow).  We sat beside a table of 4 20-somethings who, when their food arrived, spent legitimately 7-10 minutes simultaneously instagramming their meal from every possible angle before taking a single bite. By the time their insta feeds were full, their food was stone cold. Anecdotally, this  communicates exactly what this place is about: things looking really good takes a higher priority over anything else.  On to our meal: service was slow, and it took us almost 10 minutes til she came for a drink order. By the time she did, we had decided on our meal and placed all orders together. The americano looked just like drip coffee, and the food was quite meh. I got the pork belly Benny. The eggs were over cooked, the side salad was minuscule, and the pork was dry - saved only by the small dollop of whatever sauce they're using as their hip hollandaise alternative. My partner had the french toast which was also small, came with too little syrup, ultimately tasted like Wonderland Funnel Cake; which is not a bad thing, if you had have ordered funnel cake.   Also, the music selection was terribly random and not really thought out at all. Within the 60 minutes we spent there, we heard dubstep EDM (at brunch!) into Hotline Bling, and the same Spoon song twice in a row. For a place that seems to have considered every detail on how everything would look behind an Instagram lens, you'd hope they'd put comparable attention to any of the rest of the details."}
{"text":"The plant wall is stunning in its own right, and was enough to draw me in without knowing anything about the menu.  I've only tried the pizza pocket supreme, but it's delicious!  The brunch menu looks fun too!  The servers seem warm and really friendly too."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! No line up just like the reviews said, great service with a smile The food was really good Had the short ribs benny And caesar, very spicy but fun Also shared the avacado toast! Lots of unique flavors  Worth a go!!!"}
{"text":"Cutest date spot in the area.  music and incredible service. Do yourself a favour and drop by!"}
{"text":"Very cute space, nice light menu, very patient and nice staff.  I had a glass of rose and the veggie pizza pocket, and I really enjoyed them both. My friends had the supreme pizza pocket, and other various dishes, and they enjoyed those as well. The staff was really friendly and didn't mind letting us wait for the last person in our party to join (granted, the place was relatively empty since it was a Tuesday evening). They refilled our water jugs promptly and answered any of our questions about the menu items. I would love to go back for a date or to try new menu items since they seem to change it relatively regularly."}
{"text":"We went to Pray Tell for lunch last Sunday. The staff is very friendly. The menu was limited but the food was great! I ordered the noodle bowl and it was delicious. I felt the portions were slightly smaller."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with Pray Tell.  From the beautiful cocktails to the food, it was all wonderful.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! And friendly staff :) only thing is I ordered three dishes to be shared between two people and that wasn't enough food for dinner, so definitely be generous with your ordering!"}
{"text":"Friday night catch-up with your girlfriends and you need a place where you can actually hear each other? This is where Pray Tell comes in, glamorously with their insta-chic decor--yes, living plant walls and wood and dimly lit space and large display window.  Plating is beautiful so your story is gonna be jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Dem aesthetics. Flavours are subtle and refined; I lack the language to describe how lovely the ingredients worked together.  Worth multiple visits! Looking forward to a brunch sesh."}
{"text":"Drinks here are good, service was good but perhaps I won't return for food. I got their garlic bread to start and their Featured Pasta. I think my first mistake here was ordering \"Featured\" Pasta, I think it's common wisdom to not order \"of the day\" or mystery items that you have to ask to find out what it is. But I really craved pasta and my friend really wanted drinks so we settled on PrayTell. The pasta was extremely salty. The garlic bread was presented in a cute little bake dish, however, the bread was hard (not in a crunchy way) and the inside was no fluffy. It just felt like I was crunching on rocks of olive oil. To finish, I had Mochi donuts- which were okay, but kind of sad that out of everything I had, the Mochi donuts were the best part of my experience. Onto my drink, I got Schwimmer Money- I can appreciate that this drink was strong and it was a sort of balanced sweetness which I also appreciate. In summary, come for the drinks and Mochi donuts. Don't come if you're hungry."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favourite places!  It's so cute (not in a girly or pretentious way at all).  If you've got a first date, a second date or just living the single life you definitely need to come here. The décor in here is upscale and modern but not in a snooty way.  One wall is like a bookcase full of plants.  they have amazing lighting along the other (blue) wall.  Tables in the front and the bar is located in the back.  Originally here for the drinks, I was hungry and decided I wanted to try the tomato soup with a side grilled cheese.  It was $9.  It was AWESOME.  It's not like the usual shitty tomato soup - this one was rich and creamy and had a great kick to it.  You could see the herbs and crème they added to it.  Such depth of flavor in this soup...it's one of my favourite soups now.  It was cheaper than my glass of wine..lol.  The server was really lovely - I wish I knew her name - the grilled cheese had bacon in it and I asked if I could get it made without and she said no problem!  Polite, fast service and genuinely friendly.    I'm definitely going to come back here again and again.  Date or no date...this place rocks!"}
{"text":"This place is actually quite small and dark!   Pork belly eggs benedict was delicious. I liked the maple sweetness & smoky flavour of the pork. The egg was cooked perfectly, and the salad was a nice balance to the meal. The smoked salmon dish was very beautifully plated as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and drinks are excellent and the vibe is super laid back. The décor is so beautiful and it's a lovely intimate setting."}
{"text":"Super yummy cocktails, balanced flavours and not overwhelming.   Would recommend: b-side track  make nice king cold roll  My friend ordered the zombie cocktail, lol approach with caution, it's great but packs a punch with its ingredient list haha"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is exceptional, the food, the decor, the attention the detail, the curated music, but above all the service is outstanding. Fave resto in the city at the moment!"}
{"text":"Listen up insta-fanatics, this is THE go-to place for the most instagramable brunch. The ambiance in the restaurant is awesome and all the plants are so cool. The restaurant is in a great location in a cool neighbourhood not too far from the subway! We both had lattes which were delicious, I would recommend giving them a try. For brunch, I had the pork belly which was AMAZING. I haven't had something quite like that before - it was so full of flavour and had so many great elements. Would 100% recommend brunching here."}
{"text":"Pray Tell was AMAZING! Do yourself a favour and go there for brunch. The staff was so warm and welcoming and really made the experience. The restaurant has a beautiful plant wall (very instagrammable).   Between my table we tried most of the menu and it didn't disappoint. Special S/O to the smoked salmon and French toast. Plating was also 100."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and portion was perfect. I ordered the noodle bowl and it was light and just the right amount of food to balance my diet. The atmosphere was cute and good for instagram if you're into that, so go early on a weekday to get it when no one's around. My friends and I did not wait long for a table, 5 minutes max? We enjoyed our food. I'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I came here for Saturday brunch. The interior was very comfortable and beautiful. The food was good as well. I really loved their avocado toast but I wish it was paired with something else instead of the small salad. I also got the maple belly on the side which was good but nothing too special. It was a beautiful day when we went and the sun was lovely but also blinding (hence the photo qualities). If you're there on a day like I was, try to ask for a seat a bit away from the window! Overall, it was a nice place."}
{"text":"I made my 1st visit to the venue as part of a Food Crawl Event with a dining out social Group; Pray Tell was our 4th stop and I shared a quite flavourful and delicious veggie pizza pocket w/1 other.  As I/we were on a food crawl (visiting quite a few venues) I didn't have anything else to eat or drink there bur I was quite impressed with the variety of décor and the quite friendly and prompt service we received, especially as we were a group of 12.  I hope to make it back sometime to try other menu choices as there seems to be a variety of appealing options at pretty reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This new place is not only stunning but the food is out of this world! Snack bar perfect for Amazing cocktails and delicious shareables. My favorite was their unique Steak Tartare with Wasabi oil and fried baby shrimp as well as their Pork and sauerkraut Dumplings with 5 spice Jus. Lovely vibe for dates and having that late night cocktail. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried the Pork Belly Benedict, it was one of the best bennies I've tried out there!  We got some cookies topped with strawberry jam on the house to try. It was tasty- very buttery and crunchy. I unfortunately did not taste the strawberry which was somewhat disappointing.  The pork belly wasn't too fat which I liked. The meat was marinated in an interesting flavour that makes the overall Benedict very tasty. The healthy salad compliments the fatty pork belly!   I found the portion to be slightly small which isn't as filling as other places. But can't complain!   Service is mediocre."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try Pray Tell last Saturday. He traveled from Scarborough and met me at the entrance of the restaurant at 11:30am (scheduled to open at 11am). When I arrived all the chairs were on the tables and the door was locked. Someone was inside but pretended not to see us. We double-checked the hours online and at the door, and they all said that they opened at 11am. We waived at the guy inside, but he ignored us. Few minutes later more people showed up, and I guess the dude inside knew them, because he came over to the door, and opened it to tell them that they are under new management and the chef did not show up to work.   Wow! Did it ever occur to them to put up a sign?! Or open the door to patrons waiting at the door to tell them what was happening??  Horrible experience & service!   Skip it!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks amazing food amazing everything! I almost wanted to take my clothes off and run down the street screaming, just fantastic place."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed by my brunch here. The \"chilaquiles\" were a tasteless disgrace. My partner ordered the avocado toast, which also lacked taste. The plates were very small for the amount charged and weren't a high enough quality to justify the price. If you only care about a hip appearance but don't care how good your food is, go ahead and spend your money here. Otherwise, you'd be better off going somewhere that isn't just for show."}
{"text":"When a nearby spot had an hour wait last night, we had to find somewhere close by for drinks and apps. I'm glad we braved the pouring rain and ran (literally) to Pray Tell!  This new place has a young fresh feel, but at the same time, it's romantic and chic. Small, as I found most places to be in Toronto, but cozy.  The staff was super friendly and welcoming. You get the feel that they actually want to be there with their guests and they want to make sure everyone has a great dining experience.  We started with a couple drinks. If you want something bright, fresh, and delicious, try either the \"A Man Walked Into A Bar\" or \"Make Nice\". We had and loved both.  For appetizers, we ordered the dumplings and the steak tartare. The dumplings were delicious! Perfectly crisped with a delicious jus for dipping. The steak tartare is not your traditional tartare. It was really tasty. I wasn't sure about the tiny shrimp at first but it added a nice saltiness to the dish. And although delicious, the only way to improve this dish would be to add a sunny-side up egg on top; but that's just my preference.  Being open just a couple weeks, they don't have a phone # posted anywhere, so don't bother trying to call. You don't need to though, it's worth checking out, and going to back several more times!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Come for the drinks, stay for the design.  I've been here a few times, but only for drinks, though with the other reviews saying good things about the food, I'm gonna have to order something eventually.   I'm a sucker for good design, and this place has it in spades. Where it's the custom made plant shelf, the industrial-styled ceiling fans, or the great lighting choices, this is one of my favourite places to grab a drink and catch up with friends. The staff here have always been friendly, and perhaps most importantly, the drinks are tasty."}
{"text":"Pray tell is such a cute little find! Great location near college and ossington, it certainly fits in the neighbourhood.   It is a super cute place with gorgeous design. The main wall of the seating area has a lovely shelf filled with plants. It is really unique looking and I really liked the aesthetic.  I didn't have any of the food, but everything I saw other people having looked great. I tried two cocktails- Justice Beaver and Bug bud, little bud. They were both really delicious. I would go back for the drinks alone.  The server was really lovely and friendly. He was very attentive without being too clingy.  I would absolutely come back and I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Pray Tell. Possibly my last. Pray tell why, you ask? (That was horrid, I know). The menu has changed, not for the better. New ownership? The bar menu is uninspired. Used to be some very appealing cocktails on it. Had to fall back to the Old Fashioned (with Buffalo Trace, oh no). Meh.  The menu has a Mexican theme now. Lots of tacos and tostadas. Not a bad thing. We had the tofu tostadas. Tangy lime and cilantro created it a tasty snack. The tofu was tender and well marinated. We both enjoyed it.  The service was friendly and attentive.  Here's the crux. We ordered a \"Caesar salad\" and got five pieces of romaine with a few globs of bland dressing and a couple cherry tomatoes. Besides the awful mediocrity of it, it was an insulting portion size. Might as well have given me a leaf and a bottle of Rennes."}
{"text":"You had me at pizza pocket.   But you kept me with everything else.   I visited Pray Tell last night with some friends for a drink and a bite on the way to a show at The Dakota. We had a round of cocktails - two B Side Tracks and a classic Old Fashioned between the three of us - and some vegetarian pizza pockets. Oh man, these things are delicious. Crispy on the outside, oozing cheesy and garlicky on the inside. Knowing these things are only a few minutes walk away from my home is dangerous.   I also loved the interior design choices here. The space feels at once cozy and airy and I kept saying I wanted to steal various things for my own home. Things like the succulent holders, the the water decanters...the marble topped tables. Don't worry, I won't. Duh.  What I'm saying is, I will probably make this place a regular stop in my rotation and I'm glad Pray Tell is finding its home in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food and drink: I had the Pierce Hawthorne to drink and it was perfect - not overly sweet, right amount of booziness and delicious! The vegetarian selection of food was decent - I had the fried veggie dumplings which I loved, and the kale salad which was decent as well.  Atmosphere and service: Trendy spot with modern, interesting decor and great service!"}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us came here for the first time on Good Friday to have brunch. The décor is beautiful and the environment was great. The servers were super friendly. We got complimentary shortbread with strawberry coconut gel which was yummy.   I ordered the salmon and egg. The others ordered the Buddha bowl, noodle bowl, pork belly eggs Benedict, and the tacos. Everything was beautifully presented. We all shared a bit so we could try the different dishes.   The salmon and egg was good, especially the egg, but the portion size was quite small for the price ($18). The pork belly was delicious, tender, and definitely the most worth it at its price. The tacos were disappointing though, soggy and weird-tasting. For dessert we got the mochi doughnuts, which weren't bad, warm and not too sweet.   Overall: It's a great place to catch up with friends and have a coffee, but some of the dishes look better than how they taste. I recommend the pork belly eggs Benedict, but avoid the tacos."}
{"text":"Pray Tell is located at the intersection of Ossington and College. This small place has a cute wall filled with plants and is a great place to meet up with friends for some drinks or snacks. I dropped by Pray Tell on a Sunday for brunch at around 12pm and had a great relaxing meal.  My boyfriend and I ordered a tea and an americano for drinks and both were pleasantly very good. For our food I got the avo-toast with a side of sausage patties and my boyfriend got the short rib benny. Both were delicious and filling. No complaints!  The service was friendly and attentive and the place was not very full so it was a nice leisurely brunch. Would return for more!"}
