{"text":"I never noticed this place before, it doesn't really stand out if your walking or driving past.  Walking in, the decor was plain, even cheap looking.  The service was slow and forgetful, but we did have a large group and there were only two people working in the whole place.  Honestly I didn't have high expectations.  But, I was impressed! The rolls and sushi were great! The fish seemed good quality and we tried several different kinds of rolls.  I can't remember which ones but I liked them all! The prices were a good range, pricier for the fancier rolls.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Really good fish and some nice rolls. 

It's brand new and not many people know about it - I definitely recommend trying it. They were super nice to us (a kid accidentally broke one of their plates and they were super cool about the whole thing). It seemed like the people running it really cared about it being a good sushi.  The most important thing from me in a sushi place is really fresh high quality fish that has been cut and handled right. These place had that."}
{"text":"I'm sorry O Shima, I'd defend you dropped out of college, got in a car accident, or got in a fight, but I'm beginning to get a bit frustrated...

Don't order delivery, please please please, don't. order. delivery.
Despite the fact that Sushi is only 75% as good when eaten at home, we have ordered delivery a few times and disappointed every time. They always have screwed up a part of our order, and last time it took an hour and a half, despite the 40min-1hr comment. I didn't expect my yam tempura roll to be warm and crispy like it is when we order there, but having room temperature everything is a little unappetizing. Our salmon wasn't the usual nice big chunk, it was like we got the leftovers, and there was cuke or something in one piece, I couldn't even chew it. 

Also, it's tough to do the \"order as you go\" style when you dine in. If 2-3 tables come in, you'll be waiting forever. 

I still love O Shima, but the frustrating experiences are toning down my sushi craves."}
{"text":"Just discovered this sushi place and bang for your buck it cannot be beat.  They have the amazing deal of $10 for 3 rolls! and if you spend over $50 you get a free appetizer.  The best part is the sushi is not just decent but actually good.  Best deal in the city right now. If your wallet needs a break from Globefish and Zen 8 then give this place a try.  Don't forget the non $10 rolls,  the Unagi roll is worth the price."}
{"text":"Simple, cozy place;  friendly service and food is good:) first time here - I'm impressed. :) Much quieter on weekdays. (That Globefish is so overated!) Will definitely come bk to O Shima again!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading all the Yelp comments, and I am pleased with the choice. Our regular sushi guys went out of business, and we have been searching for a good replacement. We have tried a few in the city and we usually hit overpriced or low quality. 

We ordered a tray and some assorted rolls from O Shima and I have enjoyed every piece. Fresh and large pieces of fish and great tasting ingredients."}
{"text":"I stopped into O Shima with a sushi-loving pal on a whim, drawn in by their promise of $1 sushi. This quaint little restaurant is cute and tidy, with a very pleasant server who seems to remember us whenever we visit. The $1 sushi is fresh and tasty, and their speciality rolls are well-priced and delicious. O Shima has become one of my regular sushi haunts for good reason.

My only \"complaint\" would be that whenever I request no cucumber in my rolls, or to replace with avocado, I still end up with cucumber. Eh."}
{"text":"O Shima offers a competent dine-in experience, they've accommodated me when I've been in a rush and their sushi rolls (which is what I tend to order) have been okay on the several occasions I've been here. I can't comment on their takeout because I've never tried it. I do appreciate their thoughtfulness at letting me use their WiFi, even if I never max out my 3G data plan."}
{"text":"18 months have passed since my first review and I am more thrilled to be so close to O Shima than ever. I just had lunch today; (almost) all nigiri is $2. I had spicy tuna (gunkan), chili ebi (gunkan), unagi, and maguro, and a yam tempura roll to fill in my tummy. Everything was superb- and I can't say \"in particular\" because every piece had me in ecstasy. Chef-owner Jo Huang makes nigiri that matches- nay, BEATS- anything I had in Vancouver recently."}
{"text":"Service is decent. 
Decor is mediocre. 
Ordered 3 sushi rolls and an appetizer for about $40. Some of the worst sushi rolls I've ever had!  Sushi rice was almost warm and very bland. All other ingredients were overpowered by the sauce, and even the crispy squid wasn't crispy."}
{"text":"Just came from a dinner at O Shima. We found out about it through one of the deals at Groupon (or similar). It was easy to locate. We came at shortly after 6pm so there was parking right outside of the restaurant on 17th ave.

We ordered a miso soup each and a party plate to share (only ate half of it, the rest took home). One of the best sushi places in Calgary I've been to. Super fresh and tasty rolls, relaxing atmosphere and good service. I think that if not for party tray, the service could have been faster. Great experience overall and will definitely be back."}
