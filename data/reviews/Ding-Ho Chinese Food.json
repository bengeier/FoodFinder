{"text":"They have great Chinese food. Everything we have had is excellent and delivered hot. I would not go for the delivery it is awful takes a long time and once they completely forgot us even after numerous calls stayed away for over a year. Haven't found a place better in the area so now we phone ahead and pick-up."}
{"text":"Don't Order the #52 Kung Po Shrimp  Don't Order the #52 Kung Po Shrimp as it is 85% cut up green peppers and celery (mainly GP by volume) and 15% sauce, peanuts and shrimp. Sauce and shrimp are quite tasty but dish is mainly green peppers. General Tso's chicken was quite good."}
{"text":"Awesome food! They are very sweet people, we got to know them from ordering so much lol. Great price and excellent comfort food."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food places in Scarborough. They have a great selection of food items from pork, to chicken, to beef and lots of veggie choices.  Takeout/Pickup is the easiest. Order is ready usually in 25 minutes or less.  Skip delivery, in my experience it took almost 50 minutes to an hour for delivery, and our house is no more than 10 minutes away.  A dinner for 4 costs just over $60 for multiple items, but there is always left overs."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Chinese take out I've ever had.  My husband and I got Dinner for 2 (A), which includes: 2 Egg Roll, Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour Pork, General Tao's Chicken. It was awful. We couldn't even finish a quarter of the meat and the rice was terrible.  The 'egg rolls' literally only have bean sprouts inside. The chicken fried rice is basically MSG and soysauce with tiny pieces of chicken, peas, and carrots mixed in. The General Tao was not in the least spicy as it's supposed to be. The actual sauce was super sweet and they doused it onto the chicken so you could barely taste anything but the way-too-thick sauce. The Sweet & Sour Pork was by far the worst. It tasted fine for the first two bites, but then when the sauce started getting colder, it was horrendous. Again, they smothered the meat with sauce, though not as much as the General Tao dish had, and again we couldn't finish more than a quarter of the dish. Both of us felt sick after having this.  I've had a lot of Chinese food, but this was by far the worst. I'm 100% sure they cater to non-Asians, who either haven't tried or don't like real Asian food.  My recommendation, stay far, far away from this place."}
{"text":"Came in to pick up my order and children were running everywhere. Why do they have a daycare at the front of the restaurant? It's very unprofessional and distracting to the customers. Miss the previous owners."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up through Just-Eat. When I was paying I saw that there was a lady changing her baby IN THE KITCHEN!  I was so shocked I didn't know what to do so I paid and left.   Threw out my food. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Well I think its time to move on I usually enjoy the food but tonight only one word describes it. CRAP.  Ordered sesame chicken with fried rice combo bbq pork slices and Won ton soup. The chicken was old it was so tough and fatty not good at all. Same with the pork 9 dollars for a plate of chewy fat so bad could not eat any of it but my dog liked it. Soup and egg roll only dishes that were ok. Almost 26 bucks flushed down the drain. Im pissed."}
{"text":"Ordered through Just-Eat for delivery.  Arrived faster than I expected. The gentleman brought my order to my door. Which is very rare in my apartment as most delivery guys won't come up, they will ask me to come down to collect the order. I was kinda happy about that.  Ordered Deep Fried Wonton, Shrimp Fried Rice, Sliced Beef with Oyster Sauce.  Large portions for single order which is really good. Decent to good Chinese food. Enjoyed the shrimp fried rice.  I would order from this place again. No complains."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, everything was considerately packaged and the chicken fried rice was great. But other dishes like sweet n sour pork and the general tao chicken was SO Dissapointing! Mostly breading with no meat inside. Never again.... fried rice is the only thing I would order here"}
{"text":"Terrible service late 45 minutes. Food cold no flavour . Called Restaurant to complain oh we are busy. Ok tell customer your going to be late don't tell them 6:05 and deliver at 6:50 and chicken balls with no chicken in two pcs. Won't go back"}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant, it is a day care due to the kids running around and bothering customers. Totally a unprofessional business. Toys everywhere and yelling and screaming at the kids. The baby's crib is also in the front desk area where everyone can see. The parents totally neglect the kids. I liked it better with the previous owners who were a bit more professional."}
{"text":"This is bar none the best Chinese I've had in a long time.  I have had other good Chinese, but there was not one thing wrong with anything I got. First off the breaded shrimp were light and fluffy, and came with a ton on sweet and sour on the side.  Hot and sour soup was perfect, lots of additions to the broth, and the broth itself was not too thick. The orange chicken was crispy but not overdone, and was very orangey for a change.  And the piece de resistance, the noodles were not oily, and had plenty of the tofu I requested extra.  Overall the bill was just over $30, and was delivered in about an hour."}
