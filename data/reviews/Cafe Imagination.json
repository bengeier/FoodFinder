{"text":"I can't believe people gave this place good reviews. It was horrible! The staff was nice and the place was clean, but the food was awful, especially considering the price. It was McDonald's quality at cafe prices."}
{"text":"No. Just no. The food was way overpriced for the quantity and quality. I order the Rosemary chicken sandwich with spinach and asparagus but there was barely any chicken and what was there did not have a trace of rosemary on it. The side salad was fine. My friend ordered French toast which turned out to just be six very, very small slices of the narrow end of a baguette that was toasted with butter. No cinnamon. No sugar. The fruit that came on the side turned out to be one small slice of melon and a half an orange slice. 

Also, the service wasn't the greatest. Our waiter (the only person there that we could see) took our orders then immediately sat down to finish a conversation with a friend. We waited for 15 before he got up to start making our food. 

Save your money and get a real meal at Caffe E Cucina on the next block.  They were very nice and my meal was tasty!"}
{"text":"My cousins and I went to Montreal for the weekend and ate here for breakfast on Saturday morning. First, we ordered coffees.  Cafe creme, cappuccino, etc. and they were very good.  My cafe creme was beautiful and I posted the photo on yelp.  For breakfast,we had quiche, breakfast croissant, and omelets.  Everything we ate was delicious! The waitress was very nice and they play nice jazz music on the radio. I recommend this place to you!"}
{"text":"Un lieu parfait pour un petit breakfast (mon premier breakfast au pays des caribous)
Je tiens à remercier le personnel de cet établissement qui a su supporter le maudit français que je suis..


 j'ai eu le menu pour moins de 6 $ CAD 
assiette bacon, oeufs, toast + expresso


 Ps : taxe non incluses ;)
Ps 2 : je sais, je sais au canada ce sont des orignaux"}
{"text":"I had a club sandwich. It was ok. I had better elsehere. I had a moccacino. I found it had too much milk"}
{"text":"3.5 - we went here for breakfast on our last day and really enjoyed it, much better than Cora's up the street.  The menu has plenty of options and the service is very friendly.  And it's reasonably priced!

My friend had the chocolate crepes and enjoyed them.  I got the Croque Madame which was served more like an omelette, with one giant scrambled egg served open faced on a croissant with ham and cheese.  It's like no croque I've ever had before (the egg should be overeasy), but it was still tasty.  

If you want an inexpensive breakfast, go to Cafe Imagination."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but my experience was just ok. 
I came in the other day and had eggs benedict. There was one waitress only and you can tell it was understaffed. The food was just ok. 
Today I went back for an egg and cheese sandwich and once I got it, the eggs looked weird, they had no taste and so I can't tell how much of that was egg and how much of it was who knows what!"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the ambience isn't great. The chairs just look lonely. I don't mind coming here though because it's usually not too crowded and they play great music (jazz+clasical)."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a bite before i headed to the airport. The food selection is interesting, i got a lox eggs Benedict which I would say was good however it didn't really come with much else. The waiter here was not the friendliest and they only had one person working up front. It was midday in a cafe and there was only 3 other people in the place :/ that should have been my first warning. The coffee was something to be desired, I honestly think the only reason i think the lox eggs bene was good."}
{"text":"Nothing special but one of the few reasonably priced breakfast/lunch places in the McGill Ghetto/Downtown area which is generally a black hole for decent restaurants.  McGill students make up the bulk of the clientele. You wouldn't go out of your way to eat there but there are worse options - like the overpriced and disgusting Chez Cora up the street on Parc. The service can be erratic, especially when crowded (I once waited an hour for a meal and didn't even get a refill of coffee)."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place! Kind and courteous waitress, fast service. Orders the croque croissant matin & it was absolutely delicious, would definitely recommend. Fairly priced, fair portions and good food! Came with a group of 9 & everyone was more than satisfied"}
{"text":"Was looking for a breakfast place with sausage.
I got the smoked meat sandwich
Hot, Grilled. Standard affair.

Store bought smoked meat. Not a lot.
Dark tasting meat cheese mustard but balanced with tomatoes.

Ok salad with tangerine pieces.

Washrooms were smelly and one of the two stalls did not have toilet paper"}
{"text":"2.5 I'd say. Came on a sunday afternoon looking for some lunch, and it was surprisingly understaffed. There was only one person serving, so things went pretty slow. Unfortunately, my friend had to head to work so she had to get her food to go instead of plated (we came with enough time to eat though....)
I got a morning quiche, which is basically their regular quiche but served with fruits instead. It was meh...rather salty and soggy, so I'm not sure if they make the quiches in-house or not. My friend got a croque monsieur and it was served on a baguette cut in half; a bit odd. Anyways, the pricing is affordable but the food is mediocre. Maybe their drinks are where it's actually at? 
The atmosphere is rather comfortable, with some radio classical music playing. I think most people would come here just to relax and chill out with a coffee, so I'm rounding up my review. 
Note to restaurant: If you plan on serving food and having a large dining room, make sure you can execute all the items well and handle all the customers!
TIP: 15% off for students!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast at 8:30am, which, in my books, is way too early to go out to a restaurant. But as I had a 1.5 hour-long class at 10am that I couldn't possibly miss and my best friend was only free in the morning, I dragged myself out of bed with the most enthusiasm I could muster in my sleepy state. 

I saw only one waitress and one chef at that time. My best friend got there before me and we chatted for a very long time but strangely the waitress hadn't come yet to take our orders. All the more strange as there were only 3 tables occupied including ours. It was only when I made it obvious that I was glancing at her that she came by to take our orders. Alright-y...

I took a cappuccino and an oriental focaccia. Inside of the focaccia there were grilled peppers, broccoli, and uncooked shrimp. One thing that bothered me about the coffee was that it had so much foam on the top. A little is fine, but this was like a heaping 1/4 cup of foam. Anyway, once that was gone, the coffee wasn't actually so bad. The focaccia was the best portion of my meal there. SO good!

I was hoping for a larger variety of coffee, taking into account that the place starts with \"cafe\". 

So end of story, waitress was pleasant-looking but not attentive, the coffee was meh-average, and the sandwich was great."}
{"text":"May 16, 2013

We stopped here for breakfast during our first day in Montreal.  Service was great, and they indulged my high school French.  We had a seat right by the window and sat for almost two hours enjoying our cafe au lait and macchiato.  The food was good, but not really notable.  Loved the jazz decor and music in the background."}
{"text":"Terrible service...as in no checking on the table after serving the food and at 8 am having to ask for coffee refills after sitting with an empty mug for 10 minutes just shouldn't be..but then again, the coffee was bitter and lukewarm...there's much better all over the place; keep walking to find it"}
{"text":"Quite a poor experience here for brunch this morning. It appeared that there was only one server working and she was literally running around in order to serve everyone. It took so long to get our coffee that my Dad actually had to get up and track her down to ask for it again.

I ordered an omelette with asparagus, spinach and tomato which was not very good. The egg was cooked separately from the toppings which were placed inside and had the egg folded over them. The toppings were cold so I scooped them out and just ate the egg. The potatoes were room temperature at best and the side fruit was uninspired. Would not return here."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Basically ignored entire time and portion sizes were minimal. I never like giving bad reviews but this place warranted it."}
{"text":"Residents of Montreal, you are so spoiled to have this spot in your fair city. Really. I want to wrap the whole place up and bring it to the US (preferably my city). If I could I would!

I *love* this place. I first came across it last year during a trip to Montreal since it was close to the hotel I was staying at during that vacation. I went there 3 days out of 5 that trip because it really was *that* good. This recent trip to Montreal, I was not staying as close to this location but I ended up walking there anyway just to eat there for breakfast most mornings/afternoons. Yes, it's that good.

Why is it good? First off, the food is incredible. It's fresh, bursting with taste with tons of vegetarian options and incredibly cheap. Here in NYC, meals like the ones served here would cost double. Not only that but they have a 4 page coffee menu in addition to their staggering variety of tasty food options and their coffee is freaking amazing! Lots of crazy flavors and varieties of coffee and/or chocolate beverages. The wait staff has been consistently cool every time I have been there and they seem to have perfected that art of knowing when to ask if you need anything and when to let you sit and savor your food and coffee while talking for long periods of time.

I am already missing this place and I just flew back today. I love you Cafe Imagination. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a good alternative to Cora's if you're looking for a cozy, non-chain type place.  Good coffee and very friendly service!  I felt like the crepes were made the day before and warmed up.  I had chocolate and bananas which was fine.  My friend ordered the croque madame but I think it was more like a scrambled egg croisandwich.  It had the right ingredients but they were deconstructed ;-) 
This place was inexpensive, quick, clean and no frills."}
{"text":"Sunny spot in a good neighborhood.  The staff was really helpful and accomodating, and the ham sandwich was on really yummy seeded toast.  Good for a snack or lunch."}
{"text":"On juge un petit déjeuner américain à ses pommes de terre. Ici, elles sortent tout droit de l'usine à patates en cubes!  Mais le clou de l'expérience: voir la personne qui prépare votre repas se lécher les doigts! Une fois là-bas et jamais plus!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some breakfast since it's a local little cafe, and the insides gave off a very cozy feel. The waitress was attentive and our food came out very fast. I got a ham and cheese omelette which came with a solid amount of toast, potatoes, and fruit. My boyfriend got scrambled eggs and bacon which came with the same things. The food was good, the environment was good, and the entire experience was good. The kind of experience you'd expect from a cafe breakfast; just good. Probably will come back here if we stop in Montreal again."}
{"text":"We walked here from the Holiday Inn Midtown about a block away. We liked the sunny, bright  appearance inside, and the light classical music playing in the background. The menu had a nice variety of breakfast, brunch and lunch items, including interesting combinations in sandwiches, omelettes and crepes. We are vegetarians, and there were many optMy husband had an omelette with asparagus and Hollandaise sauce and I had banana crepes with chocolate sauce and a side of potatoes. Overall the food wasn't spectacular but it did what it set out to do--we had a pleasant meal and felt it was fresh and good for us--The portions were not huge, which to me is a good thing! Sizes of servings were really \"just right.\"

Would I go back to Cafe Imagination? Maybe, but I'd rather find a place that knocks me over, considering all the choices there are in Montreal! Still, it did the job! Not a bad place by any means."}
{"text":"Nan mais dis donc, c'est... Beige, hein?

L'effort de décoration ne tient pas à grand chose, il faut l'admettre. L'espace est très grand et divisé en deux parties: la salle à manger et le \"lounge\" au look café. C'est là que mes amies et moi nous sommes installées après avoir dû renoncer au Pikolo de l'autre côté de la rue, faute de place.

Le problème majeur réside dans le manque d'atmosphère - l'endroit était pratiquement désert et il n'y avait pas de musique. Les tables sont disposées un peu n'importe comment, les chaises ne semblent pas très confortables, il y a de vieilles affiches kitch sur les murs... Décidément pas un endroit où j'aurais envie de passer un après-midi à lire ou étudier. Now about the food. J'ai commandé un café latté, qui était cher pour une petite tasse (4,16$ avec taxes il me semble) et pas franchement exceptionnel. Mes amies ont choisi les \"quesedillas\" (petite faute au menu!) aux légumes et le bagel au saumon fumé. Le premier s'est avéré garni de brocolis et pas grand chose d'autre, en plus d'être particulièrement dégoulinant, tandis que le second est arrivé avec une épaisse rondelle de fromage simplement posée sur le bagel. Drôle de présentation.

Props au charmant serveur qui s'est montré hyper patient et qui a rendu l'expérience un peu plus agréable. Ceci dit, ce ne sera pas suffisant pour me faire revenir."}
{"text":"My past experiences here have always been good but today, was not. I ordered a sandwich and realized I overlooked one of ingredients on the menu when it came.  I opened the sandwich while the server was present and inquired of what the unknown/overlooked ingredient was and after I admitted my mistake and kindly asked her to remake it w/o the overlooked/unknown ingredient, the server told me I would have to pay for the mistake and the one that would have to be remade.  Afterwards, I noticed there was mayonnaise on the sandwich which wasn't even listed on the same line but listed on the bottom corner of the menu (more like the \"fine print\").  Despite who was right or wrong, Customer service is Important and is Key!!!! Prior to today, the last time I came here was  yesterday for Breakfast and I frequent this place for breakfast every year I come to Montreal. I am a loyal customer!!! I could have easily left the unwanted sandwich on the table, walked out, and not payed for it!!!!!!  In addition, I guess they wanted to be facetious when they remade it for me BC they only put 1 slice of swiss cheese on the sandwich"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot near the hotels I stayed at for my race. Small but diverse menu, and a great wait staff make this a great choice to start off your day!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here on a beautiful Sunday morning during a family vacation in Montreal and absolutely enjoyed it.   I decided to try something I had never heard of before--a brie cheese omelette with green apples.  C'est delicieux! (Mind you, I'm a Spanish major with 7 years of study under my belt so I don't know nearly enough French to get by even in Quebec...Thank goodness everything is in both English and French!)  Most of the omelettes and egg dishes, if not all of them, come with a choice of white or whole grain toast, breakfast potatoes, fruit, and coffee.  The portions are reasonably sized and the fresh-squeezed orange juice is great as well.  The cafe also offers lunch and dinner, as well as many other interesting breakfast options including assorted multigrain sandwiches (in the menu I saw marshmallow, chocolate, and banana!), waffles, crepes, etc.  

A must if you go to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Cool little cafe. The guy working was a little nonplussed, but that may just be a Montreal thing. 

Clean cozy little spot with free wi-fi."}
{"text":"In a neighbourhood where cafes are overly packed, I would expect this place to get more customers, but it's always a bit empty. It's really a shame because it's the perfect spot for studying (classical music in the background makes it extra peaceful). Hot drinks and deserts are good. 
Food is good too, nothing fancy, but so many options prices are REALLY AFFORDABLE. 
You can get a full breakfast for 7-9 dollars all day, and the service has been good every time I've visited."}
