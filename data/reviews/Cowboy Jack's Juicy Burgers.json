{"text":"I have been a vegan for a year now, and many people in my family are also transitioning to the lifestyle. Cowboy Jack's have been our savours for every time we are in a pinch and need a great filling meal. We order their veggie burgers and onion rings at least twice a week! They are by far our favourite meat free burgers we have ever tried! Plus their white bean soup is also a delicious option for any vegans/vegetarians. 

Love the food and the family! Highly recommend going and trying out their veggie options!"}
{"text":"Overcooked and dry, couldn't even finish my burger. these reviews have to be biased to get you through the door. $10 wasted."}

{"text":"This place has potential but hasn't gotten there yet. We ordered 2 burgers, a fries and an onion ring and it took about 25 minutes to get it all. They had run out of lettuce and tomatoes for toppings and asked if I wanted to wait while they cut up more. I said no, I can't wait any longer. 

The burgers were way over cooked and not juicy at all. The fries and rings were good but they were cold as they were ready atleast 5 minutes before the burgers were. 

These guys move slow and do not look super organized. Maybe this will come with experience, maybe not. The food may have been much better if the burgers weren't dry. 

Either way, I have seen enough and may go back in 6 months or so. If it's better I will edit my review. If not, this will be the last for CJJB."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries! My husband and I each had the 8oz burger, very tasty, very fresh. The fries were amazing. My son enjoyed the bbq wings (2 pounds). Prices are very reasonably for what you get and I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"FAMILY owned business, that they run with pride. Spent $ on the renovations, makes the place look clean & fresh! Especially  compared to the other restaurant in the plaza, walked & out of! Burgers are fresh & customer service great! Affordable!"}
{"text":"Solid burger place. Found it by accident one day when I had time to kill. Friendly staff. Good portion sizes."}
{"text":"My grandma introduced me to this place. We used to walk a few blocks to T-bonez, but this place is actually much closer and more cost effective. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you receive. They have a lot of drink options and they tend to change up the cola. I've seen vanilla and cherry coke at times, which is a rare favorite. The owner has a tendency to be a bit short which may come off the wrong way but they're all very friendly and accommodating there. 

I tend to stick to the same old thing every time I go, but everything I have tried so far has not let me down. It's honestly worth going even just for the fries. Their fries oh man, they are SO good. The food has never taken more than 10 minutes to prepare, from what I hear the patties are always fresh and never frozen. The place is clean, but there are only a few group tables to sit at. The decor is cowboy based (hence the name) and although its not my cup of tea necessarily, it's very well done. Cowboy Jack's is easily accessible by public transit, and there is a fair amount of parking in the strip. They also have vegan, vegetarian and halal friendly items as well. 

Despite how great the food is, it seems to be pretty empty every time I go, especially for dinner time. If they put ads online or some fliers for all the apartment complexes nearby they could probably get a decent pull to promote the place. I also think they could improve by providing nutrition information either on the website (which is unfortunately not mobile friendly) or on the menu; at the very least, I could see the benefit of providing calorie information for customers. It's always nice when you can go into a place that has good food and can clearly see the information without having to hassle someone for it, I have no idea if the food is so great because it's just really that good or it comes out to 1k cal or more; that makes a huge difference. Overall, if you're passing by or live in the area I definitely think it's worth checking this place out and see how it fairs for you. I personally think there are small things to be improved on, but it's pretty close to being one of my favorite places to eat out."}
{"text":"Mediocre food - the burger was dry, the french fries were so-so and the fish was not fried fresh (frozen). Not helped by the owner yelling and complaining at a nearby table. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great place. So I've tried the 16 oz. and 8 oz. burgers, as well as both sizes of poutine. Good selection of toppings for the burgers, and the poutine comes in good sized portions."}
{"text":"Great home style burgers without the gourmet price, even the smallest size burgers is big and filling. The Greek fries here are amazing along with everything else I've tried. This place is ran by a nice family, super funny and inviting. Highly recommend to give this place a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service! I have tried the Homeburger and chicken souvlaki. Both were delicious. I had the 8oz burger which was a large portion."}
{"text":"What a let down, just another burger joint. Incredibly dry burgers. Both the wife and I came to the same conclusion at the same instant, First or second bite, \"Dry\" ? Yup! Hers had a fair amount of toppings and she made the comment the moment I was trying to swallow my first bite of a burger that only had cheese an ketchup  on it. Bummer."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new spot. Everything is made in house and has a spectacular taste to it! The burgers are huge and the amount of fries provided will leave you feeling full. The establishment is kept clean and the family the runs it is very nice. Highly reccommend"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and it was very good.  It's in between a Dairy Queen Brazier and a McDonalds and not is it way better, it's cheaper too.  Tables are clean.  Service is friendly.

I hope they do well.

We had  1 1/4 cheeseburger, and 1 1/4 bacon cheeseburger, 1 fry, 1 rings, 2 soft drinks, total was under under $17 with taxes."}
{"text":"Was looking for something new in the area and Cowboy Jack's came up. It's a small plaza on the NE corner and there wasn't much parking left at 11:40am. There isn't much seating here (5 tables, 18 chairs) so just be aware. The restaurant is clean and the lady working the counter was super friendly. They also do Uber Eats.

While it looks like burgers and fries are the stars here they also have other options such as chicken/wings, roast beef on a bun, gyro and souvlaki.

I ordered the 6oz Home Burger and Greek fries. The burger looked very good, large thin patty with nice grill marks and a great bun. I found the patty to be a bit over-cooked and slightly dry. Overall, the flavour was good and I still enjoyed it. The Greek fries were the star here. Their fries (on their own) are very good! This was my first time having Greek fries anywhere and they were awesome. I had the medium size and this could be a meal on its own!

I'll be back and look forward to trying some of their other options next time."}
{"text":"Personally my favourite burger, and fries. 

Other places have chilli cheese fries and Greek fries and they are just gross in every way and you feel like killing your self, at cowboy jacks the ingredients are right and the fries stay nice and it's very tasty. 

The beef is also high quality. Definitely my favourite burger joint."}
{"text":"The food, the people, the energy. I'm always greeted with a smile. I love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken souvlaki! Amazing atmosphere inside the store as well. It's really clean, and well kept. Maria is super nice! God Bless Cowboy Jack's Juicy Burgers!"}
{"text":"I had the home bacon cheese burger. I had super high hopes after reading reviews. I was super disappointed. The place is really nice, the staff as well, but the burger was so dry and over cooked. I honestly wanted to like it, I tried so hard. The place is fairly priced and right by my house, it would have been perfect! But I couldn't do it. Even the bacon was overcooked and dry. So disappointing. I did get Greek fries as well. Those were actually decent, nice home cut fries. But if you're going there for the burger.... You're setting sail for fail. I may try it again, it could have just been the cook that day... But.. Mehhh"}
{"text":"Couldn't quite go to 4 stars, let's say 3.5.
Great service, loved the fries and burger size options.  While I was there a dude ordered the 16oz and devoured it...
I'll go back again to verify my rating because other than being a little on the dry side the burger was actually pretty good.  If that was a one off issue I'd go up to 4 stars for them."}
{"text":"Amazing burger joint, in my opinion smokes real McCoy burgers. This is the best burger joint in Scarborough that I've tried hands down. 

Burger cooked to perfection and so were the fries. Everything was FRESH not like some other burger joints where you get soggy fries or Luke warm bugers. It was fresh made to order. 

I got the jack 8oz burger which is never frozen and upgraded the fries to a poutine. I hate when burger joints over load my poutine with gravy. The staff was nice enough to put it on the side and were more than generous with the portion.

I definitely recommend this place and will be back.

Super friendly staff customer service 10/10"}
{"text":"Cowboy Jack's is a recently established burger joint in the Eglinton East area of Scarborough. Burgers, fries, and poutines are the focus of their menu which boasts patties in various sizes (up to 16 oz). It's a friendly, family atmosphere here with a relatively small, cozy dining room. There's seating for approximately 20 guests. It's quite clean and comfortable to sit and have a meal here.

Aside from their angus burger, all of their patties are made in-house. I found the burger to be tasty, fresh, and filling. You are able to choose from many toppings including pickles. Chipotle sauce is a good option. I decided to take off one point as the sauces I asked for were squeezed on somewhat heavily. Presentation is an aspect of serving burgers that they should pay closer attention to, although it wasn't too much a big deal.

There's definitely some potential here, if they work on a few things. A young man who appears to be the son of the owners can get very chatty with customers he is acquainted with, causing him to lose his focus on other customers who have been waiting. Also, the poutine I ordered had much more gravy on it than was necessary. The gravy was piping hot which meant I had to wait quite a while for it to cool down. The prices are pretty fair, and I'd definitely try them out again in the near future."}
{"text":"I just came this morning to have lunch 'coz i'm starving. I ended going away, again for bad customer sevice. I had a bad experience with this place a long time ago but I did not post a review, because maybe they just started and maybe does not know much of customer service. My coworker and I one time ordered food and sat on an empty spot, although there is a cup of tim hortons on the table. I thought it is another customer's cup and just left it there for some reason, but nobody else aside from us was in there. So i put the cup on the other table. The lady who took our order just went yapping that I was not suppose to do that because it is hers. I said sorry and I did not know, but she just still won't stop talking. She was saying that it is THEIR spot. So we just transferred to another table. Lady is very rude. Foodwise, burnt burger, dry, nothing special.

Oh yeah, this morning, i said i will give it a try. Maybe the lady in front managed to improve and I want to try if the burger is ok now. However, upon asking the lady what is on special, she answered like she is upset \"oh we don't have any special, only what is on the menu\" oh i said ok, i backed off and a couple of guys entering, maybe coming back. She pleasantly accomodated them and said \"oh did you guys post a review already?\" I just felt that she is just really selective when it comes to being nice with somebody.. Chinese restaurant beside them is just way better. Very friendly, respectful (constantly) and food is nicer. 

Just felt bad with the attitude, even if it is the best burger in town, i won't be coming back and recommending anybody."}
{"text":"Went in for a 6oz homeburger, fries and a domestic beer. Including taxes came out to about $14. The burger was flavorful, toppings were fresh and quality, fries were awesome, and the beer was, well, a beer. I give this joint 5 stars. Staff was friendly and it's a family operated restaurant. Can't go wrong if you are in the area and craving a burger. Next time I'll try their other menu options like a souvlaki and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Alberta, and are so happy we randomly found this hole in the wall. 

We had the Greek fries, poutine and veggie burgers. 

Everything was delicious. We absolutely loved the Greek fries. The portions were so big, we could barely finish (we did finish though, it was too good not to) 

Whether you are having a veggie or a normal burger, you must try the Chipotle sauce.

Definitely check this place out. Friendly service, clean,great food. :)"}
{"text":"Why ever go to McDonalds again when you can just come here? The burgers are made fresh, you get to choose your toppings and prices are more than fair. I recommend you get the lunch combo and upgrade your fries to chilly cheese fries or Greek fries.

Overall, this is a great little burger place. Perfect for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing meal at Cowboy Jacks! It was my first time here. 

Welcomed by a wonderful woman, Maria. She's great and so personable! 

Three of us sat down for cheeseburgers and fries. 10 minutes later our order is up. A massive burger in a fresh bun and beautiful crispy (but always soft) fries..... we all left full and very very happy campers

Can't wait to come back for the Greek fries and souvlaki !!!"}
