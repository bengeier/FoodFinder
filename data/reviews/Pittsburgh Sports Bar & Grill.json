{"text":"The best bar in castle Shannon all the bar tenders are nice good  food good drinks and great people"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only bar i go to. Small but drinks are good its an everyone knows your name kinda bar. Its pretty much locals. Good people."}
{"text":"The inside of the bar smells like old cigarettes. It's an old lingering smell. Everything may need deep cleaned. The wings were alright. A bit too much of the jarred diced garlic. The service was alright, I was the only one in there since it was the start of lunch hour."}
{"text":"Awesome place for good food and drinks. Jersey Shore wings are money. Owner is cool and just a nice overall friendly neighborhood bar ."}
{"text":"This is a very good local sports bar that I visited for lunch recently. 

The good points are that there are two big high def screens behind the bar that make for a real good viewing experience. When I went, there were no Pittsburgh teams playing so they were showing another MLB game. It was nice that they were playing the audio from this game. Most sports bars I've been to only turn on audio for high profile local games. 

It looked like it was mainly a bar without many tables, but I didn't walk through the whole place. The beer selection is ok, with a few taps but it's not a place for experimenting with craft beers. 

They have some specials listed on a chalkboard. I went in the Thursday and the special included $3 burgers. That's a really great price for a burger that was pretty big and tasted good. The special didn't come with anything, so I got some onion rings that were fine. 

I'd definitely come here again when there's a game I want to see while getting some drinks and pub grub."}
{"text":"Horrible place to go.. It's small and the locals act as if they own the bar. The bathrooms are dirty and the bar isn't that clean. The owner doesn't act like much of an owner, he is very immature and gets drunk with his patrons. Would not recommend at all!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for me I can save you a little time. Don't bother to look here. I can guarantee that I won't be here. I never write negative reviews but this place was horrific. But if are looking for a smoky filthy place where you can kill an hour and twenty minutes waiting for a burnt burger then I have got a place for you. If you are bothered by wait staff all up in your grill then try this place where they don't come to your table ever (Seriously, ever. Not once.). Add 14 dollars for Diet Coke (there was two us after all) and you have got a recipe for magic. Do what you want. Me? I'll be doing it somewhere else."}
{"text":"I didn't even want to give this place a star. The bartenders were drunk. Clearly drunk. Doing shots with patrons. The old hag that did end up greeting us didn't even ask for our drink order just kind of stared at us in a drunken stupor. Luckily the other bartender grabbed our order and gave it to the clearly drunk bartender who rolled her eyes right in front of us. Rude as hell. Sorry I don't care how good the food is the service is shit."}
{"text":"Smokers bar. It was our first time here and didn't expect much. Loud and smoky inside, nothing fancy. The people inside weren't the greatest and a little rough around the edges. There was only one employee working at the time. We ordered wings, hot pepper cheese balls, a burger, and drinks. We were told it was going to be a little while since she was the only one working, which was fine. Everything was made to order and fresh. We were surprised with the quality of the food. The wings were big and flavorful. There was 4 pieces of bread (in a good way) on the burger with lots of cheese and the cheese balls were very good as well. Overall, we would come again but maybe just do takeout."}
{"text":"This is a yinzer bar.  Dirty, smoky, the bar tender was drunk.  But if you just want to stop in for a quick drink you can have a nice time I guess. I believe this is the least sexy bar in all of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for some appetizers. We noticed that it looked really small from the outside but it wasn't that small when we walked in. We both got Mac n cheese bites which were excellent! I also got the pierogies which was good. She got a  order of bacon cheese fries which was huge! The bartender was extremely nice and the regulars at the bar were too."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Amazing food and great atmosphere. It did take a little bit to get my food but I understood since they seemed a little understaffed. It happens. The employees didn't seem stressed, instead they seemed super happy and loved getting to know their customers. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The one bartender is nice here that we usually . What I don't like is that the owner is a creep and wouldn't stop hitting on me and my friend he is like 50 it was just unprofessional but what do you expect its pretty much a dive bar that is filled with old pervs"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have fun. Good bar food at very reasonable prices. Totally would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff (Brittany) and great food...I'm especially fond of their wings, which are always big, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  The \"Jersey Shore\" is my favorite variety so far."}
