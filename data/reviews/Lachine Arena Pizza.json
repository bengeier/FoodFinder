{"text":"Nice bright cozy restaurant. I appreciated how they kept everything so squeaky clean from the water glasses to the washroom. You seat yourself and your waitress brings you a jacked up menu with sections crossed off with black marker and old prices covered over with white labels with the new prices written in.  Ordered the Sole Almondine, Caesar salad with Bacos, and Kok/Kokakia (Greek cream puff). Hubby and I shared everything; we enjoyed our meal and the service of our lovely waitress. I especially enjoyed the Greek cream puff (words of the waitress) which was much more dense than a regular cream puff with the top and bottom layers tasting more like sponge cake than choux pastry topped off with decadent chocolate glaze.  Homey welcoming atmosphere with lots of take out traffic, a few free parking spaces at the side of of the restaurant, hockey on the boob tube and French music in the background. Beware of the one way streets!"}
