{"text":"Burgers are good but that's what you expect with bobbys name on the door. The place was pretty empty with about 10 customers and about 12 employees just standing around. 
The service was less than mediocre. Brianna who brought our food knocked my sons drink all over him and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. In fact she said she didn't do it when clearly she did if other customers said they saw her do it. It was obvious that there wasn't supervisor presence in the establishment. It's going to take customer service for this place to survive on the strip. You get what you pay for here. Good burgers and no customer service. This proves it is is hard to find good help! I expect more from bobby flay."}
{"text":"I was hesitant going to this store because it looked kinda empty from the outside (this was in the afternoon though); and the place does not look appealing (color looks like 7/11). 

But I checked it out. It turned out it's good. I ordered the Philly burger, onion rings, bacon french fries, and cookie/cream milkshake. Everything was good except the bacon french fries - it was soggy. 

I'll come back to this place again."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere but their burgers are regular. The bun and cheese tasted like the ones I buy from the grocery store. I ordered medium but the burger was cooked well done. The flavors on it are good but the fundamentals are basic."}
{"text":"Great service, one of the cheapest and best meals I ate on the strip. Had bobbed bacon/ blue burger with the potato chips on top.  Sooooo good and worth the 2 mile walk from the hotel"}
{"text":"One star for great tasting food, another star for making my strong stomach purge this meal a few hours after consumption. I was celebrating my 21st birthday weekend here in Lovely Las Vegas and today(may17th) my girls and I decided we would try the award winning Bobby's Burger Palace. Worst fucking mistake! I am currently sitting with my head in the toilet instead of enjoying Calvin Harris at Hakkasan tonight (which was my last hoorah before returning back to arizona) I am currently dreading what tomorrow has in store for my stomach because I am boarding a plane promptly at 8am to head back home....I already suffer from altitude sickness and I'm praying to baby Jesus that this sickness goes away before I get on my plane. The burger itself was amazing and tasted really juicy, cheesy, and crunchy(it had a layer of chips on it), I am so disappointed that this was experience just a few hours after eating here . I would definitely consider it to be alcohol induced....but I haven't had any in well over 12 hours. Thank you Bobby for giving me food poisoning :( this never happens to me!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment . First they tell me they ran out of Cabernet. On a  Tuesday? In Vegas?...tables dirty full of trash. Really small burger, nothing special. Fries look like the frozen ones you buy at market.

Save your money...go across the street and eat at Chili's. I wish I did."}
{"text":"We rarely eat hamburgers, this restaurant is beyond fabulous forcing us to be regulars for the week we spent in Vegas. The staff is friendly and quick and the food is worthy of the name in the door."}
{"text":"We celebrated our daughter's 21st birthday in Vegas the end of June.  She loves Bobby Flay! and wanted to eat at his Burger Palace.  I was soooo disappointed for her, 5 of 7 of our party hated! their burgers and could not get our server to come back to our table - they weren't that busy, either.  I left all of mine except for two bites. While waiting for assistance, my sister-in-law and niece continued to nibble on their burger - they were swollen from lips to ankles the next morning.  The salt was ridiculous!!!!!  I was so discussed, I left a penny for a tip.  Never have done that before.  Stay away unless it's a salt lick you're wanting."}
{"text":"So disappointing! Isn't Bobby Flay famous for his hamburgers?! We checked the menu online before visiting the restaurant. The prices are $3-$4 more than listed online. I ordered the crunchified burger, which the cashier said was the most popular. It was much smaller than the bun, and it wasn't very good. My $4 order of fries was overcooked. I would not recommend this to any of my friends, or visitors to Vegas. What a huge let down. The only positive thing was that the service was great, and everyone was so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This review is based just on the customer service and the Crunch burger since that's all I ordered.

I find the customer service is always top notch here. The gentlemen at the counter was great with answering questions and making sure there was nothing else we needed. He really represents Bobby Flay's brand well.

The burger itself was excellent! It was well done as I had ordered and very juicy with great flavor. The chips on top are just genius and provides the extra little snap to make this burger great! 

This is a great burger joint! We paid about $20 for two burgers and a drink. I think that's a bargain for the quality that you receive."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The menu is simplistic, easy to understand and it's a burger joint.  Let's not confuse ourselves with a bunch of unnecessary stuff.  If you want a burger, this place is great.  

Atmosphere is super casual and the place was clean.  It was a place I was comfortable taking my kids to, which is nice since it's on the strip.  And that brings up the only negative I have...It was super hard to get to!  I'm not a local so maybe I don't know the tricks for parking, but I really had to commit to that burger to convince my fam to bypass a thousand wonderful-looking restaurants to find this mystical burger joint.  

That being said, it was delicious and now every time I see Bobby Flay on TV, my mouth starts watering.  Not for him of course, but his burgers are gorgeous!"}
{"text":"May be one of the best burgers I have ever had  got the New Mexico burger salad style(no bun on bed of lettuce) Yum! Perfect size amd flavors.  Food came fast and staff was very nice"}
{"text":"Good fast casual restaurant.  The staff seemed to want the guests to be happy.  Service was fast and the food was good.  It's not life changing or anything insane, but they have good quality unique food that's a little more interesting than your average burger bar."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. I believe it was the sauce. It was a special sauce. The Mexico burger truly was sow thing to taste again. I enjoyed the bacon and cheese fries as well."}
{"text":"Go to margaritaville.  Self serve.  White or red wine from ???   Disappointed in bobby"}
{"text":"The flavor of my burger was what sent me over the top. I had the Philadelphia: provolone cheese / griddled onions / hot peppers and I will crave that burger when I get home. I was juicy and spicy; just what I was looking for. I also had the pineapple coconut rum milkshake was just perfect to cool down the peppers on my sandwich. My husband and I did not have to wait to be seated and the staff was very nice. I could have eaten hear more than once but I wanted to try as much as Vegas had to offer."}
{"text":"Surprised with the entire experience. Absolutely the best burger my wife and I have ever had. And we have had burgers. Walked two miles to get the rob the Vegas Strip. Would love to do it again"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck awesome burgers and fries.great sauces to compliment your meal and great service by waiters.Enos one of the waiters very excited about working for the company and meeting Bobby Flay."}
{"text":"This is a sin against Bourdain and pains me to say this but this place is better then shake shack and a lot of overpriced burger spots. Think about you got Bobby flay the red head monster making burgers. I had the burger with egg and added the potato chips! Good stuff. It's leaves me with nightmares about why I didn't try the fries or anything else lol. Hidden gem in front of mandarin oriental. Must try get it!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.   Burger patty was tasty but in pieces.  Vanilla shake was amazing but mint chocolate chip tasted like a chocolate shake with a dash of peppermint extract.  Strawberry wasn't much different.  Blah.  Waitress removed the cost of one shake but we expected more from a Bobby Flay $6 shake."}
{"text":"I thought everything was amazing. I love the cookies and cream milkshake and the crunch burger."}
{"text":"I came to BBP today (LV) to try the burger out I was very interested being that I watch his shows on tv as well as I run my own restaurant in Atlanta ga (kitchen of Atlanta ) that has burgers not only was I very disappointed by the way the burger was presented to me it tasted like a regular burger that I could of got at any burger place I will love for bobby to come to my place to try out my burgers as well as the other plates! 
The kitchen don't wear hair nets and the guys have long hair where a hair net is needed the manger shirt was not tucked in the place was not bz at all the bathroom was not clean there was no soap in the bathroom!! 
I will love for bobby to challenge me one day on a burger!!"}
{"text":"When we planned on going to Vegas, the first thing I wanted to go to was Shake Shack and In-N-Out... Because obvs. 

But while walking on The Strip, my family decided to stop here instead. They live on the East Coast and they have a location there, and they swore up and down it was the best burger they had ever had. And I can agree to that!

I ordered the Bobby Blue as a salad (because I don't think my stomach could have handled another bun) but I totally wished I didn't! Not because the salad wasn't great, but I wished I had the whole burger experience! The patty was freakin' delicious! It was moist and tender and very flavourful. My mouth is salivating right now as I type this review. 

Better than In-N-Out? For SURE. Better than Shack Shake? Absolutely. I wish there was a burger joint that could compare in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Disappointingly Mediocre.  Always loved Bobby Flay's restaurants all over - looked forward to this.  Lame-O.  You want a shake? The black and white is vanilla ice cream with a squirt of Hershey's chocolate for $6.50! Great food photography was not the food we received. Shrugging disinterested help and  a noisy cafeteria. I see this gigantic ad on the strip and thought it might be something special to try. Not much special here.  I would definitely NOT recommend it."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last Tuesday.  I ordered the Bacon Crunch Burger and my wife ordered the Bobby's Veggie Burger.  They asked me how I wanted the Bacon Crunch Burger cooked and I said medium and it came out well done.  It still was very good but not juicy at all.  The Veggie Burger came with Red Chipotle Mayo and my wife asked to have the mayo on the side.  It came out with the Red Chipotle Mayo on the bun with a side of regular mayo and it fell apart while eating it. Too bad they don't listen or care how you want things.  The sweet potato fries and pickles were good."}
{"text":"The Philly Burger was tasty and so was the one with blue cheese.  The onion rings are out of this world.  I only wish there were more in the order.  It only came with 6-7 onion rings.  The margaritas with good and strong.  As for them to mix it!"}
{"text":"James at the bar was great. So friendly, helped with our orders and made our experience very positive! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!! This was my second visit and everything was as great as I remembered. Order the Miami!! Its a cross between burger and Cuban sandwich. The sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly. Service was fast & friendly. Restaurant was super clean. The 70's decor is fresh and just makes you feel happy. Prices are good for anywhere, great for being on the Strip in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would totatally 100% give this burger place a zero for stars. When we walked in, I first noticed that it was pretty empty at 7:30 pm. 1st bad sign!!  Then we ordered our food and walked to a table and the restaurant was dirty! I was sooo shocked because I watch Bobby on TV constantly and I expected anything that has his name attached to it would be a 5 star place. The bathroom was dirty too. Our food came and I was so disappointed. I got the Dallas burger because the cashier said it was his specialty. I took 3 bites. Terrible!!  I'm very disappointed!!  I will never be back. We watch all of the food network cooking shows and we try to eat at as many of their restaurants that we can find. Don't waste your time or your money coming here. We went to Guy Fieri ' s restaurant last night and it was fantastic.  Next on the list is trying Giada's restaurant. I hope she has put more into her restaurant than Bobby has. I asked the cashier if Bobby ever comes here, and she said maybe 3 times since it opened. Boy, you can tell he doesn't care about his Burger Palace."}
{"text":"The basics are here.  The burgers are decent.  It's well designed.  You can definitely tell that someone is borrowing the name to fill a space in the hotel.  We even went to the management because the bathrooms were gross and the faucets were running and they said they couldn't do anything because the hotel oversaw those.  That just seemed to speak for the whole experience."}
{"text":"It's so sad that I have a write this review but it's much needed. I decided after work today that I wanted a turkey burger for dinner so I preordered through the app. I got to BBP 10 mins later and had to wait in a 20 min line , when I got to the front my burger was very cold and I asked if they could remake it. They said yes and I waited another 30 mins and come to find out my new burger had just been sitting there and no one was going to bring it to me beside the bartender who actually cared and ended up being the one to bring it to me. I'm highly disappointed with the customer service here."}
{"text":"Great location!  Food bad!!!!! My burger was smaller than the piece of Canadian bacon on it for the February special.  Asked to have it crunch infield and add tomatoes and lettuce and burger came with none of those. Although the meat was good a much better burger is found at Johnny Rockets 
. Would never come back even though I love Bobby's other restaurants. 
Don'T waste your money here !!!"}
{"text":"HOLY WOW!  I regret having to post this review.  I went to BBP on Saturday May 3rd. 2014.  I ordered the Dallas and LA burgers.  The burgers were slightly above average.  I took my wife here because she wanted to eat at a Bobby Flay restaurant.  Well, to be exact, the bathroom is why I am posting.  It was the worst bathroom I have ever seen.  The urinal was overflowing.  I just pee'd right on the floor next to the drain vent.  Why? well, because it looked like someone had given the toilet a \"spray-on tan\" if you know what I mean.  I'm not trying to be crass, but I should have posted a pic of it on Bobby's twitter account.  I bet someones head would have rolled.  That picture would have gone viral due to the unbelievable level of sanitation.  As far as excellent burgers go...1. Ho-dads in San Diego (Single Bacon Cheeseburger ).  
2. Burgers and Beer in Willoughby, OH (Jalapeno and pepper jack stuffed burger).  
3.  The Grind in Phoenix, AZ (Nogales Burger )."}
{"text":"Holy seasoned salt Bobby! That's about the only flavor I got off the meat. We ordered the Bobby Blue and the Dallas. The Blue was just..cheese. The Dallas had so much salt I don't know what else came on the burger. Loved the honey mustard horseradish dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries, but everything else was a fail for me."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to burger places while in Las Vegas but I'm familiar with Bobby Flay so I thought I would try it out. I have been to this place twice. The burgers and onion rings are good. It's pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Burger was cooked as ordered but average. Fries were greasy and overdone. Onion rings were really good. Black + white shake was out of this world."}
{"text":"Solid burger. Not going to wow you, but it'll do the trick if you don't want to spend $100 on dinner."}
{"text":"Wanted a cheap meal that wasn't entirely fast food and deep fried. We walked by this place and were surprised at the various burger options (angus beef, chicken breast, or ground turkey as a base!) I got the Vegas which had vintage white cheese, red chile peppers, and BBQ crunchies aka potato chips. The chicken was moist and the flavor was great. It really hit the spot. My only complaint is I would have liked to see more veggie options, either more vegetables on the burgers themselves or a vegetarian option that isn't just a grilled cheese. The workers were all very friendly and polite and when I asked a lady working for the wifi password she told me they didn't have it set up for customers yet--but she gave it to me anyway! Very pleased and would come back again and try those spiked milkshakes."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and had the classics and loved it.  Went back a second time and was really disappointed.  Both times we visited we noticed workers sitting at the counter eating their food or having a break.  Several times one of the \"servers\" got up from eating his food to serve food to guests.  Never washed his hands between eating his food and serving others theirs.   Gross.   Both times ordered ice tea and had to ask for refills as they don't provide tea by the soda fountains.  \"Waiter\" seemed irritated that we asked for refills and we never got them.  I was so excited to try this place but wouldn't recommend.  Go to any other burger joint on the strip.  There are a ton of options."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome but the french fries were so greasy and soggy that I'm surprised such a celebrity chef would allow something like that to happen in his restaurant. If he saw those fries made by any other Chef on his TV show he would fire them. Bobby I hope you will read this one day and correct this problem with the french fries after all they are an essential part to a burger. Just check out the pictures that I have taken and you'll see what I'm talking about. Another problem to go to the restaurant is parking you have to park at the Aria Hotel and walk all the way down the hill to get to the restaurant. Otherwise you can do valet parking at the Mandarin Hotel for 20 bucks! One thing I really liked is the interior design of the restaurant I thought it was funky."}
{"text":"Save your money. Aside from being located on America's sweaty and unwashed fat roll (the Strip), the place had all the charm of a frozen yogurt shop. Without ordering drinks, my family of 3 ended up dropping $50 for what amounted to mediocre fast food. Seriously, in-n-out would have better, and I could afford a haircut afterwards. Why bother asking how you want your burger done when they don't cook things any other way than 'well done'? They say this guy is a chef or something. Whatever. Best part is when I tried to order a beer, the cashier said 'save your money, go to a bar'. Awesome."}
{"text":"Was psyched in trying out Bobby flay ' s burger joint. At first I was disappointed because they weren't vegetarian friendly. They didn't have veggie burgers in their menu. so I just ended up ordering their griddled cheese and my man tried their original crunchy burger. My griddled cheese had good cheese in it.. but the sandwich was kinda mushy Because of the juice of the tomato which was in b/n the cheese and it tasted salty as well and to top it off the pickle just made it more salty. 

According to my man his crunchy burger was juicy but it tasted salty too and the chips in between just made it more  saltier.  They must have placed too much salt when they seasoned their burgers as well as the tomato/salsa of my griddled cheese sandwich.

The service on the other hand was great! I liked how the staff were so attentive. The interior of the place was nice too for a burger joint.

The price wasn't really worth it though. ."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the Philadelphia burger, onion rings and blueberry-pomegranate shake this was over $21. The onion rings and the shake were both very good. The rings were light and flavorful. The burger was so so at best. The peppers that were on it were so spicy I was choking, and once I got rid of those it was just a burger you could get anywhere. The atmosphere was nice and different. The service was zilch, took our food from the window to our table 2 feet away and never came back. And she was complaining about other costumers to other staff members right by us. Would I ever go back?--NO"}
{"text":"I visited Bobby's Burger while in Vegas. I had this restaurant on my list because of the famous chef. We went around 3:00 on a hot day so there were not many people dining at the time. I ordered a turkey burger with the fried egg on top. I shared an order of sweet potato fries with my cousin. Our food was very good. My burger was juicy and I loved the sesame bun. I was disappointed that that staff had not cleaned some of the tables because they were not that busy. We sat at table near the window so we could see the street.   Someone had started cleaning the table but had left a dirty table cloth on the table and the napkin holders in several chairs along with the condiment containers. This took up several chairs along the window. We were in the restaurant over an hour.Other employees saw this but never addressed it. This made the restaurant look dirty. I will try some of the other burger restaurants during my next visit."}
{"text":"Food was okay, wouldn't eat here again. With all the options in Vegas, one would imagine this place would be a lot better. The service was HORRIBLE!!!! Staff is not friendly at all. They all look like they hate their job. took the waitress 25 mins to offer us drinks, didn't even greet us just walked up to our table and said \"what do you want to drink?\" really lady!!! Then took about 15-20 mins for her to bring our drinks. Time to get our food was average. They didn't check back up with us at all after they brought our food. Took about 15 mins for us to get our check after flagging down a random waitress. Customer Service is definitely a huge area of opportunity for this place. On the upside the alcoholic beverages were delicious."}
{"text":"Needed a snack and we were pleasantly surprised by Bobbys. Great burgers! I got the Dallas and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm so sad I found this on the last day in Vegas! I can't wait to go back and try the spiked shakes! I got the Dallas burger and added the crispy. That's how I ate my sandwiches growing up. And the sauces...so many to enjoy. The counters to sit at are fun, and the stools are comfy even for short girls. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"We live in a small town with so so restaurants so when we travel, it is all about the food. We are in Las Vegas. I am looking at all the choices for food and my wife wants to go to Bobby's Burger Palace.
Bobby's Burger Palace? I can get a hamburger anywhere, but I gotta keep mama happy.
We were staying at the Aria so it was a 5 minute walk. We arrived late...about 9:00pm. Only a few other people in the place.
We walked up to the counter and ordered. My wife got the Bobby Blue and I got the Brunch Burger. We also got a combo of fries and onion rings.
I wanted one the their spiked milkshakes, bourbon, rum or vodka...but I can't have dairy. I just had a beer.
Now...when I said I could have a burger anywhere.....not like this. This was the best hamburger I have ever had, and I have had plenty.
This food was off the hook. Best hamburgers we have had, fries and onion rings were also amazingly yummy. Bobby Flay lives up to his reputation with this place."}
{"text":"I'm a Bobby Flay fan, but I came in with moderate expectations after reading some so-so reviews. My wife and I ordered a burger each, plus an order of 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion rings. The fries/rings were solid, with the rings being the better of the 2. The burgers though were excellent. My wife ordered the palace classic and raved about it. I had the Bobby Blue and came away impressed. Great crust on the burger, and it stayed juicy inside. They even gave us 2 lemonade's to go even though we had only ordered 1 to split during our meal. Great food and great service. And anyone complaining about the price is crazy. 2 burgers, fries/rings and a lemonade for under $30 on the strip is a steal."}
{"text":"This place has been a very pleasant surprise since the first time we randomly stopped in off the strip.

The burgers are melt in your mouth delicious and getting coleslaw and potato chips on a burger is just plain awesome.

The prices are also fair considering it is right on the strip, with other places charging almost double for a burger that doesn't taste as good.

I did sample both of their margarita mixes, but they were too sour for me to want to order.  Other than that, I really like this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the Dallas burger medium and my friend had the New Mexico medium rare. Who would have thought the medium would be pinker than medium rare. This place is supposed to be all about burgers but if it can't get the cooking temp right, then what's the point. I read another review that stated their server refilled their drinks for them. I had no such luck getting my iced tea refilled. Nota fan, won't come back."}
{"text":"First time here. Everything was great especially sauces!!! Perfect sized burgers and very fresh toppings. Enzo, our server was very helpful! Love that Filipino broom that he uses!!!!awesome atmosphere, very clean and love the nostalgic debit..."}
{"text":"The infamous BBP. The complete standard of the gourmet burger chains in the US. Shall I make you my first review on yelp? 

So I've been to BBP in Philadelphia, NY, NJ and DC and all of them are pretty consistent on their \"service\". Which brings me to Las Vegas and is why it gets a 3 star rather than the 4 I would give the others. Maybe it's management but the employees don't seem as motivated as the other locations.

The food was still to standard. I found that they've added the brunch burger and the Vegas? to the menu. I always lean towards the LA burger \"crunchified\" with the sweet potato fries (BECAUSE THE ONION RINGS ARE HORRIBLE) and that darn chipotle ketchup. There were many times that I've been close to stealing a bottle of it.

What I do think is a flaw is the tipping process throughout the chain. Since there's no tip line on the card receipts, the staff relies on cash. We, as customers, refill our own drinks and help ourselves to the condiments when they aren't around which makes us feel like we don't really have to tip the 20% for server \"unnamed\". That will be all."}
{"text":"Extreme flavor in the sauces and cooked to perfection. Nice setting and very open. Highly recommended for late night bite"}
{"text":"I think this place is great because there is great variety, it consists of high end hamburgers, and it is less expensive than going to Flay's Mesa Grill at lunch if you just want one of the burgers. 

The staff is very efficient and very friendly, which is a nice touch. If you have friends who want chicken, you can choose that instead of hamburger if you want and all still be happy. 

I highly recommend this place if you want a delicious and unique hamburger on the strip."}
{"text":"Nice set up and sitting area . Food came fast.  The burger was cooked perfectly to Our requests.  Nice tasting burgers .The sides were sweet potato fries and onion rings. Large portions of both.  Two concerns.  The beer I ordered I had to go and hunt for. Second the onion rings were so loaded with grease I could only eat one"}
{"text":"Convenient, efficient, and one spot above \"fast food\" but a gimmicky upgrade only and def overpriced.....welcome to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My sister and I tried this place on a recent trip to Vegas. She had the classic I had the L.A which was chicken, tomato, avocado relish, watercress and cheddar. We both really liked the meal in fact, we raved about it to each other  for most of the trip. She had sweet potato fries and I had regular and a chocolate shake. Couple little thing would have put this experience at an excellent.

1.) my fries were good but quite salty.
2.) the shake was good, flavourful and thick but it was a regular 250 ml plastic glass for $6.50 which was a bit pricey in my mind. It's not fancy with whipped cream or cherries or big glass or anything like that. Just a good ol milkshake but if it was at a more reasonable price point my sister would have had one too.
3.) the biggest issue: the service sucked. We went in around noon and asked when they closed that night and were told midnight. So round 9:30ish we go over thinking we'll have plenty of time. We were one of 4-5 people in the restaurant and the staff seemed to be closing up. We were there for maybe 45 minutes and at the 25 minute mark things felt super rushed. The plates were taken away without being asked it we were done, the stink eye was given. 

Side note: when debating if we should try Gordon Ramsey or Bobby Flay's burger joint, we noted that Ramsey's is in a casino which was filled with smoke, Bobby's is a stand alone place with no smoking."}
{"text":"I'm on vac from New York and everytime I visit Vegas I go to Bobby flay it's never a disappointment everything is on point ..."}
{"text":"Really good burgers but restaurant floor not clean when it opened at 11am today. Their system was down (again?) so I couldn't charge it to my hotel room. This happened to me at least 4 times this year. I also couldn't use the BBP app for rewards when I paid for my $50 bill. In the past year I have only been able to earn rewards once, since their system is always down. I go to BBP on average once a month when traveling to or through Las Vegas."}
{"text":"As promised, Bobby Flay has delivered an excellent burger experience that is affordable and right on the strip. I had the June special (the Napa Valley) and sweet potato fries and my boyfriend had the the Dallas. The service was also really great!!
I would recommend that anyone go here for a fun and budget friendly lunch."}
{"text":"When here with some friends and it is always great! I have been here a few times but always let my friends know if they want to go to the strip that this is a great place to get a burger at a good price for Vegas. I will be back again with in a reasonable time but for locals going to the strip is not ideal. Hope you enjoy and I always get the Miami!!! It is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a good Adress to come down a bit from the Strip. 
Burger and Ice Tea was good and the guy at the Front Desk was very Helpful! 
I would go there again"}
{"text":"Prices are SO reasonable, for a restaurant located in near some of the most expensive hotels in the city. Milkshakes are perfect, so worth the extra minutes on the treadmill. Try the vanilla bean or the coconut. The brunch burger is delish if you like fried eggs and/or are hungover. I'm a big fan of the Philadelphia burger because the patty is completely covered in provolone."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced. Ten dollars for a burger that I could have gotten at in n out. Sauces were bland. If I was Bobby Flay I wouldn't want this place associated with my name."}
{"text":"The wife wanted to experience all her favorite TV chef's cuisine during our recent trip to Vegas so we ventured to Bobby' Flay's burger joint for stop #1. 

I expected more, especially for the lofty price. What we got was a couple of decent burgers, but nothing we couldn't get at a dozen other burger places, honestly I think Johnny Rockets has a much better burger. I got the Bobby's blue, and I am shocked to hear myself say this, because I love cheese, but this had too much cheese. Could not taste the juiciness of the burger it was so drowned in cheese. My wife had the classic which looked to me to be a fairly run of the mill burger. 

We also ordered a half and half fries and onion rings and were presented with an anemic order of fries that was barely enough for 1 and TWO onion rings. The onion rings were not even the same size, bringing the spectre of conflict into the picture as the two patrons must then choose who gets the bigger one. C'mon, two freaking onion rings? This was a $5 side order and was supposed to be half and half. Perhaps the other half dozen onion rings were MIA, I don't know. 

Service wise, the place was empty, but somehow our burgers came out 5 mins in advance of our drinks. Unacceptable. As for drinks, I ordered a strawberry shake, which taste wise was fine, but here again, the glass was not very large, it didn't come out with the metal carafe with the rest of the shake, and for 9 bucks I would have expected a hell of a lot more. 

Summary, unless you are absolutely dead set on trying a Flay spot, pass on his palace, its extremely poor value, mediocre service and palatable but rather ordinary food.

Edit: I did get an almost immediate response from the BBP social media person promising they would address the shortcomings in my review with the LV location management. I will not change my review, but kudos to the social media manager for being on top of their feedback."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places.  Every time I am here the burgers are cooked perfectly to order, and there has never been an issue regarding flavor!  Our server, Enzo, provided my wife and I with great service and wonderful suggestions about how to enhance our meal.  I keep coming back here when I am in Vegas for a good reason!  Definitely pick up the onion rings while you are here, and make sure to get potato chips on your burger (a phenomenal crunchy treat!)."}
{"text":"Our original destination was GR's Burgr BUT--when we were told it was an hour & a half wait, we started walking. Not being familiar with the area, it was a pleasant surprise to find Bobby's Burger Palace. Yippee for us because we fed 2 kids and 2 adults for a FRACTION of what we would've paid at the OTHER place. Thanks, Bobby!! We loved it and WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and even better burgers! The best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Everything is clean and we lived the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best food ever I ordered my burger medium rare it came out perfectly it tasted so good I got the New Mexico highly recommend it I love spicy food but surprisingly it wasn't spicy rather the jalapeños added flavor than spicy ness"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife on our last night in Vegas.  Stopped in around 9pm and the restaurant was not very busy.  We ordered the brunch burger (fried egg, bacon & cheese) and the new mexico burger (queso sauce, green chilies & pickled red onions), both crunchified (topped with potato chips).  We got the fries/onion ring combo along with the premium margarita and the cactus pear margarita.  

The burgers were excellent, both cooked perfectly to order.  Crunchifying each burger seemed unnecessary as they were pretty rich to begin with.  I thought the New Mexico burger was slightly better because it had a nice kick of spice with the green chilies.  The fries and onion rings were awesome as they have a few different sauces you can try including chipotle ketchup.  The only reason for 4 stars is the cactus pear margarita wasn't that great.  The premium frozen margarita, on the other hand, hit the spot.  

I know there are a lot of celebrity burger joints in Vegas, but I would definitely recommend Bobby's."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Go to Guys or Gordons! Ewwww! I even asked for a refund! The only thing good was my pickle and shake. Go elsewhere. The guy who took care of us was nice. This is not worth stopping for! I expected way better!"}
{"text":"Had the New Mexico burger, which was very tasty. My only criticism was the New Mexico green chiles tasted like were actually pickled jalapeños that were roasted."}
{"text":"The burgers, fries and shakes are mediocre---far from great, not close to what should reasonably be expected from a so-called \"celebrity\" chef.  And, the set up is strange as well:  Order in the front and they bring it to you.  So, if you want anything more--we didn't--you have to stand in line again.  

We wouldn't go back even if the meal were free."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here with a buddy just because it was there ...had no idea it was bobby flays though I guess it's in the name.

It's an upscale burger place with a modern twist.. burger I had was definitely on point and I thought surprisingly cheap for Vegas...

I would probably not have bothered even reviewing this place if it were not for the jalapeno poppers..
 My sweet baby Jesus they were miles ahead of any sort of side fried thing I have ever eaten. They were served in little shot glasses with some sort of spicy sauce... Every time I eat anything bit sized and fried I think of them.  Perhaps I was really drunk but damn it those things have become as illusive of a taste to experience as a unicorn/ great white buffalo... Next time I'm in Vegas it's the first place I'm going... Don't let me down bobby!"}
{"text":"I had no clue this was Bobby Flays burger joint - we were just starving and needed food fast! Having said that I was a little underwhelmed. For the price, the burgers were quite small. Reminded me of family reunion barbecue burger- minus the great taste.  I ordered the turkey burger that was quite juicy (which was good) however, there was no flavor/seasoning whatsoever. On a positive note, the service was good and the fries were pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing. Never had a patty seasoned so well. I like my burgers classic style so ordered the palace classic. Make sure you order your burger crunchified - it makes a huge difference. Ordered the black and white shake because I couldn't decide between the vanilla or the chocolate. It was one of the best shakes I've ever had. Couldn't decide on a side so ordered fries and sweet potato fries.

It was definitely a lot of food. Sat by the window and had so many people walking by and staring at the burgers. Worth checking out if you're a burger fan!"}
{"text":"No \"wow\" factor here, no kids meals either. Fast food burger joint, self-serve soda fountain, like Carl's Jr. or In-N-Out only 2 to 3 times more expensive. Crunchburgers were the cheapest thing on the menu at $9, and the only thing on it was a bunch of Lays potato chips. Huh? We also got the LA Burger, too salty. All were overcooked and a bit dry. Strawberry milkshake was yummy, but it was $7! Sorry Bobby, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had read online about this place, and the burgers with the potato chips served on top (which they call \"crunchified). Well, I cannot say enough good things about this place. The cashier that took our order was very friendly and was able to answer my questions. Our food came out in a very timely manner, and was cooked exactly the way that I wanted. The ambiance is great - very modern and trendy! Overall, a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Great burger place. Folks are really nice. Burgers come in under $10, and are huge. Lots of flavor choices. Also have option of beef, turkey or chicken breast burgers. Sweet potato fries were not cheap but delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! great food and I love the bar area. Had  the sweetest bartender I wanna say her name is Lena (sorry I'm so bad with names) But she was very friendly and answered all my stupid questions so that was a plus for me! If your thinking about going in definitely check out the bar. Best burgers in town and great cocktails that's what I'm talking about"}
{"text":"Walked in expecting greatness... Smelled rancid oil as soon as I opened the door,  then walked away. Clean it up Bobby!"}
{"text":"I came to Bobby's burger Palace cuz I was on my way elsewhere, but when I saw this, I was starving.  I ordered the New Mexican, which sounds phenomenal.  I mean, its good.  But nothing that I felt was WOW.  But it wasnt bad either.  If youre wasted, its probably the most amazing burger ever, cuz it does beat the average burger spot.  I also ordered a Margarita (which they had to have prepared for me upon order, but when I had my to-go food delivered to me, I asked where it was and they guy who delivered just took my word-for-it, and made me one.  Its good for the guest, but not for the business...anyway, that margarita was so STRONG, I had 2 beers before and I felt AMAZING after!  I wrote about the good and bad, therefore, the 3 stars is well deserved"}
{"text":"After a pleasant walk on the Strip decided to stop and try out Bobby Flay's new spot.  Great atmosphere and decor. Had the crunch burger.  Was a little heavy with the salt. Cooked perfectly.  Decent size order of fries that were very crispy. Liked the ketchup.  Normal priced for a Strip burger place.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I have EVER had. The staff is so unbelievably friendly. Enzo our waiter was attentive and fast. Fries and sauces were delicious. My wife and I had the turkey burger and it was awesome! A must if you're visiting Las Vegas and are craving a good burger!"}
{"text":"Bobby's place was exceptional. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. My family was able to enjoy a high end burger, fries and a shake without the high end price. The location is great and the ambiance excellent. 
We had a little bit of everything and we can't think of anything to complain about."}
{"text":"I Like the seating and the casualness of the restaurant. We came to get a milkshake and onion rings. The mint chocolate chip malt was awesome. The onion rings were huge and a good ratio of batter to onion. Enjoyed both of them!"}
{"text":"Turkey burger was very well seasoned. Everything was really fresh & clean. Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"This review is not about bad food. The food was actually quite tasty, it was the managers work ethic that was tasteless. 

I came in with my boyfriend today at about 4:30 for a quick bite since we were staying right next door at Aria and also I'm a fan of Bobby Flay. The \"manager\" (and I use quotes because we'll, I'm using that word loosely) was sitting next to us, not working but instead talking to a tall dark handsome customer who I'm pretty sure she knew. The ENTIRE time we were eating our meal, we sat there listening to her loudly talk shit about the employees and as well her manager. Apparently her manager wanted her help to rent a party bus of sorts but then he backed out and now he's an ass for doing that.. According to her. After she gave him the price he told her it was too expensive and didn't want it but her opinion was, why take your family on vacation if you can't afford it. STFU! It's not your place to say those things and you work in a fucking $10 burger joint so don't act like you have room to tell other people how to spend their money. Also, I had to eat my meal listening to her tell the other customer/friend how one of the workers is lazy and she always has to keep an eye on him. That's fine, but any manager with a little sense in their head would know to not do that in front of customers who are trying to eat their lunch. I was really turned off by how unprofessional she was and it's sad that the other workers have that kind of a person they have to answer to...or that they're being talked about behind their backs In front of customers by their manager ..how embarrassing. 

Brunette manager working Saturday 9/20 afternoon shift get a grip! I was 2 seconds away from telling you off but my boyfriend stopped me, thank god for your sake... You need to be embarrassed just like you did to your workers. You really struck a nerve and I hope this review comes back to you. These 2 stars go out to you. Set a fucking example."}
{"text":"Update.......still good burger but the place was even messier than the first time I went in there. Is anybody on clean up duty around here.? And, it was only 6:30 at night that I was there. I've just got to wonder, if the place isn't clean, how can I expect my food to be.
I'd be willing to bet a kings ransom that Mr. Flay wouldn't put up with this for a second."}
{"text":"First trip to Vegas so definitely had to stop here. Line to order took FOREVER! One cashier. At lunchtime. On Vegas strip. Seriously? I didn't knock off a star for this bc it gave me time to study the menu and cashier was super nice. It wasn't her fault the mgr never sent anyone to help her. I ordered the chicken burger with bleu cheese and bacon. I mistakenly thought it would be ground chicken, but it was a grilled chicken breast. Even better. It was HUGE. Fries are separate, no combos on this menu. I ordered cheese fries. Also HUGE. I  could have split them with a friend if I had known the order would be so big. Another friend ordered the onion rings. This was literally enough for a family. Biggest rings I have ever seen. Nice atmosphere. Servers friendly. Drinks are self-serve except for the lemonade. The servers keep you refilled on the lemonade. I was surprised that you could not order grilled mushrooms for your burger. Simply not an option. Definitely worth stopping by. I ate the sandwich and half of the fries and samples an onion ring. I was full for the rest of the night. And believe me when I say this is no easy feat. Seriously."}
{"text":"The Onion Rings are very good. Had the Philadelphia burger which was pretty good as well. The Chipotle ketchup is a nice touch to any burger. Nothing too special about the fries. Like the style of the restaurant.  Don't too much care for having to share tables with total strangers."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and great service. The staff really know their menu well. Super clean and efficient. Thumbs up experience compared to counter and food quality rivals the counter but better dining experience overall. Hope the open one in California soon. Sauces are great and buttermilk onion rings are to die for.  Juicy burgers. Great experience. I'm putting this up there with the Spruce burger and Roam burger in San Francisco."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Bobby's Burger Palace and with just as much enthusiasm I felt that I must write a review about my experience. It was a nice clean place and the service was very good.  If you are looking for a good burger I am afraid that you will be disappointed.  It makes me wonder if Bobby really has anything to do with the food.  If you are looking for a good burger, try Johnny Rockets or any place else.  The burgers here were not satisfying.

Forgot to mention that the fries and pickles were the highlight or our dining experience."}
{"text":"After reading my review again i wanted to clarify that, compared to other places in Vegas the price of my meal was actually pretty average. My mind set was comparing the meal to one from my home town which would have been much much cheaper.

I hope this helps."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the kitchen is really disorganized. We sat at the counter  right in front of the kitchen and I saw my food coming through the window. I knew it was mine because it was a special order, and I watched as it sat for TEN minutes before they finished cooking the rest of the  order and brought it to the table. I watched the couple next to us get one burger, five minutes later their fries and a few minutes after that the 2nd burger. I am  sure Bobby would be horrified. It wasn't that great that we would go back."}
{"text":"The beef LA Burger tasted so good. Great service from the cashier Jamie and the waitress. On my way out, I filled my cup with ice and water. I couldn't  find the waitress and Jamie. There was a cashier (looks Caucasian) who, after taking an order from the customer, I asked for a cup cover. There was only one guy waiting. Not sure why she snapped back at me after I politely asked for a cup cover. She stated that I interrupted the other guy from ordering. I left the water in the counter. Too bad I didn't get her name. She desperately needs additional customer service training. So, food was great but poor service from that cashier. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"Great location. I live in city center so I frequently walk down and get a milkshake or burger to-go. Prices are a bit higher than average, a few dollars more compared to other locations, but that's expected since it's on the strip. 

Fries and onion rings are not great. Don't get the side combo. It costs more and you literally get two small onion rings.

Try the pistachio milkshake!"}
{"text":"Okay the burger was good but ..... 
The service was horrible, and $4.00 for 5 onion rings (really we counted because we were sharing an order)!
It's set up like fast food (order and pay, then sit and wait).
I saw the wait staff sending people from one counter to the other to place orders because they were \"too busy\" running drinks to tables.
Maybe they were having a bad night but it ruined the vibe for me. 
The counter looking at the strip (best seats in the house) were filthy and the had the condiments sitting on the seats.  
Nobody re-filled my drink and we had no silverware plastic or otherwise. 
The burger was good but at $10.00 it better be."}
{"text":"What an awesome, amazing, tasty burger.   We came in half hour before they close and service and food was great.   They're crunch burger was as advertised...anything other than med-rare is a sin.

Bobby, u done well !!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, very attentive and food was amazing. Prickly pear margaritas are a must! Fairly priced meals. If you're in Vegas you must stop here!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!  I got the Crunchburger and my husband got the Black and Bleu.  We split a dark chocolate shake which was delicious but small.  The onion rings were great and so were the fries.  Reasonable prices for Vegas!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for a burger without fries. The service is good but definitly not worthed."}
{"text":"Really good burger. Great French fries. Sit near the window for a view of the Strip and fun \"people watching.\" A bit pricey like just about everything in Vegas, but definitely a \"keeper\"."}
{"text":"Nice interior design, color scheme & settings makes you think it is a sit down restaurant but in fact it is a fast food type like the Carl's Junior. 

A \"Numbered\" stand is provided after you placed order then you proceed to find your own table & place the \"Numbered\" stand on your table so that a staff will bring your food when it is ready.

The LA burger tastes blend; I have to add chipotle ketchup; bottom part of the bun is flat & soggy.  But the meat patty itself is perfect - medium rare - crispy outside - nice & juicy inside.  Use brioche buns would be much better.

The burger of the month - Cheyenne burger is very good but the bottom part of the buns is flat & soggy as well.

The Super Kale salad is okay but a bit on the salty side.

Blackberry & Pomegranate and Blueberry & Chocolate shakes are way too sweet for our palate.

The worst thing is a trip to its restroom - 11:45AM - multiple stains on the stainless steel trash bin;  no toilet paper holders but 2 rolls of wrapped toilet papers in its place instead.  A half used toilet paper roll sits on top of the toilet water tank!!  The floor is extremely sticky, it almost feels like your shoe bottom is glued to the floor inside the first stall!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location was right around the corner from my hotel and directly on the strip so great! Being the FNW fanatic I am I had to try. So I got the burger of the month Cheyenne Burger grass fed beef with sharp cheddar smokey bbq sauce topped with buttermilk onion rings and bacon. Washed that down with lemonade which wasn't housemade just Simply brand and a combo of reg and sweet potato fries. Sounds delicious right!? Well it was kind of a let down here is why #1 when it was brought table side no onion rings on top!  #2 my bun looked toasted to the eye but it was soggy once drenched with the gobs of bbq sauce #3 it was room temp. I ordered it medium so it was cooked to perfection  but I didn't care for the bbq sauce I've made better at home. The burger itself would have benefited from some good ole s&p and the fries were good but those onion rings were the star they were absolutely phenomenal and gave the burger the flavor it needed. I'd return just for those onion rings! Another friend ordered the same and it failed to impress her as well but another loved it so aye. Also another patron ordered bacon cheese fries which is on the menu with scallion but neither received. So the kitchen needs to pay attention to small details. I'm not naive enough to think just bc its Bobbys restaurant we should have perfection bc it isn't him cooking just his name. However I definitely expect some standards which I didn't see. All in all I'd go again that Brunch burger caught my eye and those onion rings are a must have again! Who knows I might get a shake also they looked delicious"}
{"text":"Wow! Great burgers. Cooked perfectly. Excellent toppings.

I recommend the grilled onions. Bun was soft and flavorful. Salad was great with a good mix of interesting items to diversify the lettuce. 

Quick, reasonably priced with one of the best burgers I've had."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! I took my family here after a long walk on the Vegas Strip and it really hit the spot. My wife said it was the best grilled cheese sandwich she has ever had. Fries was delicious and plentiful. Different sauces were fun to try, cool music, clean, and friendly."}
{"text":"Three days ago was my first time here and now I sit and it's my fourth time here. These buglers are on point...  If you want something delicious and reasonably priced then look no further. Additionally they offer a very nice military discount."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try a Food Network chef's restaurant, so this was our chance. My husband, me and our 3 yr old daughter had a great experience there. The food was delicious. My husband had the Crunchburger, he ate up his burger in 5 minutes! I had the L.A. Bunless Burger. The burger without the bun in a mix of greens. We shared the fries and sweet potato fries. Best sweet potato fries I have had in awhile. It came with honey mustard and chipotle cream sauce. The decor is causal, loved the design of the eating bar. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"We spent $40 for 2 Classic so dried up Burger with a bun full of sesame seeds,  an order of burnt onion rings, blueberry_pomegranate milkshake, and coffee milkshake. And I thought Bobby Flay knows burgers. Beware it's just the name but the food it's not what you expect for a seasoned chef like Bobby Flay. We always use yelp to help us with restaurant selections when we are away from home. It's like our guidelines for great food when you're traveling. I was very disappointed with the food. Though the service is good but our food is a very big disappointment."}
{"text":"This place has great food but they are understaffed and very very slow. Literally sat with 4 people in front of me for 26 minutes to order!! Not get served!! Order. One cashier who seems competent but it's a grind to get an order in. Also after waiting for a very very slow order.. then finally get to front and the cashier takes a phone order for 7 minutes. This place is stealing money. If you don't hire enough people."}
{"text":"Wow I think I have found the perfect burger spot! I always watch what I eat and usually avoid fast food but the Dallas burger was on point, they even asked me how I'll like it cook, and they got it right with a frozen margarita"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the brunch burger rare my guy ordered the classic burger and the onion ring french fry combo. Seating is fun, staff helpful and friendly sauces excellent. the onion rings were some of the best ive ever had. the fried were fine but not nearly as good as the rings. our burgers were very good. only complaint is my rare was the same as his medium. I like my burgers one stop short of mooing so this was over cooked for me even though their grill guide said red and cold in the middle it wasnt even close. But overall we would go back."}
{"text":"Cashier and the staff were refreshingly friendly.  Nice portions, alcoholic milkshakes are next level. Will be back"}
{"text":"I ordered western and my GF ordered on salad and I must say we were impressed by the quality of the beef. It was really good, a bit salty but good. However prices are a little high. Like their salad aswell and fries are OK. Not the best burger in the world but definitely worth trying if you visit vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers in Vegas if not the best. The items on the burger are simple yet so tasty. The burger is flavorful and cooked to perfection. The price for the burger is really cheap compared to most of the burger joints on the strip. I would have expected them to charge a lot more. Defiantly a must try if your visiting or live in vegas."}
{"text":"Der beste Burger-Laden den ich kenne. Hab noch nie so einen guten Burger gegessen wie hier. Wenn ich irgendwann nochmal nach Las Vegas komme, dann gehe ich hier bestimmt wieder rein."}
{"text":"There's lots of places to get a burger on the Strip - even within just a few blocks of this one. These range from fast food, to reliable fast casual, to somewhat adventurous. I'm pleased to say that Bobby's Burger Palace offers adventurous burgers without trying to go so crazy that they muck up everything. I got some sort of special Louisiana burger with sweet potato fries and glass of mango-lemonade. It was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice on it to make it tasty. Plus, with a variety of ketchups to select for my fries it was a great meal. Plus, the service was quite good, creating a very pleasing experience that I'd love to share with others in the future."}
{"text":"This place offers several varieties of really good burgers with toppings that aren't common in most burger chains, such as Fresno red chiles and pickled red onions.  They even offer a brunch burger topped with a sunny-side up egg and bacon.  The burger I ordered was cooked nicely, juicy and flavorful with a good quality bun and fresh toppings.  I like that all their burgers come with the offer of \"crunchifying\" them- adding potato chips as a topping for no extra charge.  It makes the burger a little salty but adds a nice texture.
The french fries and sweet potato fries are also worth ordering.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was the drinks.  The place offers three flavors of spiked milkshakes.  I ordered one, but I am positive there was NO alcohol in it at all.  I am a lightweight, and if there had been alcohol in the milkshake I would have noticed it.  However, in a glass of milkshake that was approximately 20 ounces, there wasn't even one shot of alcohol.  I felt ripped off that I paid nine dollars for a regular milkshake.  If you go, definitely try the burgers and sides but don't bother ordering a spiked milkshake because it is a waste of money."}
{"text":"I had a Miami burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. I had ordered the Miami burger medium without pickles and mustard. It was delicious! The sweet potato fries paired well with Chipotle ketchup, in my opinion. I also ordered the Mocha Caramel milkshake, twice. It was that good!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Bobby Flay Fan. I try his restaurants every time I travel. My favorite being Bar Americain.  I hate to say it I do not like Bobby Burger place. 
He needs to do away with the prefixed menu and have burgers any way you want them.  We should be able to mix and match and have it the way I want and not 1 of the seven types. Why don't you have a vegan option? I like veggie burgers. 

All the reviews said to try the sauces? Hmmm their are no labels on them. I had to get a employee to explain the sauces evidently your labels rubbed off the bottles? Are you kidding me? Get a new system! 
The drink choice are also poor. Get with the system and get some better upper end sodas and not a soda machine I can find in any fast food restaurant. Please get a wine dispensary not some plain wrapped wine nobody knows anything about.  A choice should not be white or red. Maybe rather California wine? Or Australia or Washington?
This is not a good representation of him or his good with this concept. Nice way to make a few bucks."}
{"text":"Was walking the strip and came across this restaurant and we decided to try it for lunch.  Had several interesting sounding burgers on the menu and we tried one with green chiles and Monterey jack cheese I think, it was the Vegas burger.  When the food came out I was a little disappointed in the size of the burger, very small for the almost ten dollars with no sides.  Ordered onion rings and fry combo for around five dollars and received three onion rings which were big, but really only three with the fries.  It is a place to grab a quick bite if in the area, but was not a big fan overall.  There are much better choices in the area for a much better value."}
{"text":"Had the Bobby Blue and Sweet Potato Fries. I would give it a 5. Issue with the place was that we never received our shakes till we had one bite left to finish meals. Manager was never seen on the floor when they knew people were not happy. No water or nothing was offered. Sorry Bobby your place FAILED. Five days in Vegas and this was the worse service I paid for."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger medium rare and got a well done, tasteless abomination. I had a better tasting, juicier burger at an airport Chilli's today.
The sweet potato fries were only slightly better.
The chipotle ketchup and \"burger sauce\" where very good.  
Won't go back and not recommended."}
{"text":"Tried it out but wasn't as good as I thought it was gonna be. I did like that they used watercress in their burger but not enough for my personal preference."}
{"text":"Excited about going here for the past month.  Terribly disappointed.  Service was great but food was mediocre at best.  No, we won't be going back and suggest you do the same.   Love Bobby Flay but he sure as hell lost this throw down."}
{"text":"Ok, 2 part review...
Part 1: had a burger and fries with a soda for lunch, total was just under $20. A little spendy, but pretty average for Vegas, maybe even on the cheap side for this town. The location and atmosphere were great, i sat at a bar style seat looking onto the strip, it was nice. The burger was great! I got the classic crunch style and the meat, bun, toppings were delicious and clearly high quality. One note, I've heard this place compared to In-and-Out or Shake Shack... Not a fair comparison... These burgers are more gourmet and better compared to Red Robin or Five Guys, and I think it was better than both of those.
Part 2: we went back in the afternoon for refreshments and Nora was our bartender. She was awesome, just outstanding on every level! I got a Margarita for $10 the was strong, delicious, and all around wonderful. The wife got the Little Raspberry which was $12 and her favorite drink of the trip so far.
Tip: go with a friend, sit at the bar, split a burger and fries, and get strong delicious drinks from Nora!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend 

Sat down after ordering.  I noticed that cleaning was in progress on the island I was sitting on.  There were dirty countertops on the island as well.  

My burger came almost immediately after ordering.  No way it was cooked to order and while it was medium as I ordered it was barely warm.   Onion rings were ok.  First two were tasty but the bottom few were a greasy mess.  They arrived after my burger

Cheese on my burger was cold and gross

Bussers never cleaned the area around me ( was there about 20 minutes).  Also a busser dropped some frys on the floor and then picked them up and threw them away.  He then grabbed some towels and wiped his hands without washing and went back to his job.  I could see the dish area from my seat. 

Restaurant seemed heavily staffed in the kitchen and the dining area but I found the restaurants pretty dirty and the food pre-cooked."}
{"text":"Great for lunch. Fast yummy burgers. Fries are just ok. Onion rings very good. 4 stars instead of 5 because the gentleman taking my friend's order forgot to put her order thru and the rest of us had almost finished eating before her food arrived...after we had to remind him.

Also found the ladies room to be dirty!"}
{"text":"Food is just normal American burgers. I give it 4 star for it's convenient location and business hours."}
{"text":"Had the Dallas burger. Excellent. And the honey mustard sauce that comes with the sweet potato fries - must have! I will be back."}
{"text":"Burger was so good!  Cooked how I asked, great toppings and atmosphere.  I couldn't believe they weren't busier!  Awesome mojitos!"}
{"text":"Overrated to say the least. Burger was \"ok\", did not stand out to be this awesome burger you would think. Would not go back as I would rank it as something off the Wendy's menu."}
{"text":"Very yummy. Loved the buttermilk dip for the onion rings and the coconut smoothie. Great service too. Thank you for the recommendations Enzo - one more satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. The burgers are bland, the pickles are inedible due to their saltiness, the onion rings try to impress with size but they are flavorless, floury and under cooked, the fries were cold and the shakes were flavorless. The one savior was the grilled cheese which was delicious. We won't be back. There are plenty of excellent burger places in Vegas that don't have a high end price with low end quality."}
{"text":"The customer service was very nice and the service was friendly. The burger was meat was overcooked dry and they add potato chips to the top of the burger to make it crunchy....big deal...its okay but I have had better...."}
{"text":"Came for lunch when we first arrived. Tried the Cheyenne (spelling?) Which had bacon, cheddar and fried onion rings. The burger was very delicious. I thought the fries were very good too. The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because the women's bathroom was really dismal and in need of maintenance. One of the toilets didn't flush..."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! You will not be disappointed!
Pricing is not bad, flavors on point, fresh ingredients and customer service is fantastic. 
I got the L.A. Burger with fries. The decor is very modern and it's bright and spacious. Definite must try :)"}
{"text":"We went out for a burger after work, and decided to go to bobby's burger. Since its from bobby flay i expected to have great burgers

Its on sat night we order 3 different burgers, i am very dissapointment burgers were sandbags meaning they were precook rare and rest then cook again onion rings are oily, french fries were saggy

Sweet potatoe fries were ok !

Restaurant, when we arrive there were no boddy at the counter, when the gentleman finally decided to return his vibe was just ewww and looks intoxicated 

Walking into the restaurant servers were found hangout out by hot line window bent over having a good laught with cooks 

Cleaning towels were  every where, along with a wash buckets, our table where we decided to seat on was not wipe clean, 

Bobby, if you can see this, on a sat night on the strip your burger joint has lesss than 10 ppl in it, and above is the few reason why!"}
{"text":"The burger was very good as well as the fries. The menu is creative and diverse. There are many options for getting a good burger on the strip, and this is one of them. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great burger! Ordered the burger of the month (July) and the crispy burger! Wish I got the onion rings...they looked soooo good! Took a little while to get our drinks but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with everything at this restaurant! We are vacationing in Vegas for the week. My wife is a HUGE Food Network fan, so we are eating at all the Food Network stars' restaurants. My favorite was Guy Fairi's (5-Star) and my wife said, \"Wait until we get to Bobby Flays' Burger Palace!\" Well, once again, what a disappointment! The place was nearly empty, the floors were filthy, bathroom was horrific, not to mention the food had a difficult time measuring up to McDonald's or Hardee's. However, a waitress came to our table, noticed my wife didn't eat her meal, and took that meal off our bill. Kudos to her! Bobby, if you read these reviews, you may want to visit your Burger Palace more often. Disappointed......."}
{"text":"Dang Bobby I really wanted to love this place... Unfortunate the food was so salty I left feeling terrible and thirsty. The girl at the cash register was so nice and funny though, but doesn't make up for the $60 meal that was tainted with salt. I will give it another shot though just because I love Bobby! Hopefully this time our food won't be such a let down. 
Side note: my husbands Miami burger was fine!"}
{"text":"Ok. The staff? Is great. Excellent bartender, very friendly. The burger? It was good. You know what gets the 2 stars? You pay for a premium burger, place how you want it cooked (medium), and it comes out well done. You're a burger place. It's unacceptable and absolutely a negative. Figure out how to cook the meat, Bobby, and maybe you'd have something. Until then, accept the scathing review for missing the mark."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!!!  My husband and I got the New Mexico & the Carolina burgers.  Both were extremely good!!!"}
{"text":"No complaints. Very tasty burger, the pink margarita have me a buzz really quickly, plus brain freeze. I had the classic with chips in it. Who knew I'd like it!!"}
{"text":"A fan of Flay and as such I have to say he needs to close this or remove his name.  It is damaging to his brand.
This is a step (maybe) above Wendys and costs 4x.  Burger was OK, margs are too sweet.  Decor is horrid, staff was friendly but seemed disorganized.  Our margs came after we finished eating.  If he is going for fast food joint he should price it as such.
Headed to Shake Shack next time."}
{"text":"We love this place. Amazing flavors -as we have experienced at all of the Bobby Flay restaurants we have had the pleasure to dine at. We try to copy at home. Service has been so-so, but that doesn't bother me too much- slinging burgers in Vegas isn't my dream job either..."}
{"text":"The burger I had tasted like a Burger King burger.  I can't understand how they could charge so much."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and a great taste, but I was sick for three days after eating here. You'd think a gourmet burger joint would at least know how to cook a burger. I'm a big Bobby Flay fan, but a trip to his burger palace ruined a $200 dinner at Mesa Grill."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try out this burger joint...after all it's bobby flay burgers! I'm giving it a three stars mainly because 3 of that stars are for good costumer service!! The burgers however are a different story...the meat is ok but the rest is super salty...we ordered 4 different burgers on the menu and all of them were salty!! Bobby flay needs to really check his food he might be surprised on how the staff is cooking them! Anyways we're not coming back here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Overrated...
We are huge Bobby Flay fans and we have been to Mesa grill several times.  We decided to come here, but the hamburgers have nothing really special, the flavors are bland, the buns look and taste like supermarket bread.
As per the sauces, there is nothing special
We had the Canadian, the Dallas, the supercrunch and the Philadelphia and NONE of them was great, just plain ok. 
There are other places in vegas with better burgers..."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in while on vacation and it was so good we went back twice. This is more of an upscale casual lunch spot. Between the two of us we tried 4 different burgers and all were incredible. Quality ingredients. Cooked just right. Very friendly staff (our server remembered us when we came back two days later) . An order of fries is definitely big enough to split."}
{"text":"Burgers are very wet and soggy which I did not like.  They fries are pretty bad too, very hard and well done.  I will not becoming back."}
{"text":"Server circled room for 4 .minutes with my food calling out a number different from the one they gave me. Apparently it happens often. Food was good, fries excellent. Very Pricey. Nice modern decor, inviting. For the same price, prefer BLT at Mirage."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I had the Crunch Burger with extra bacon and a side order of fries. The burger was very good. Fries were excellent. I added the sauce that came with the fries to my burger and that made it even better. I would definitely come back. Loved the food and atmosphere was good, too."}
{"text":"Wow, Lola was the most pleasant, well spoken and helpful counter person I think I have ever met.  I am from Orlando, the hospitality meca.   The food was great and we got it quickly considering it was made to order.   Awesome cheap lunch in Vegas"}
{"text":"The meat in the burger is alright, you can choose how you want it cooked. Overall the food is pretty average."}
{"text":"I went in at 11:00 pm and the staff was not very pleasant. My order was delivered promptly. My friends' order was not. We sat there for 10 min watching the staff walk through the kitchen window where the bag with his order was until a tall black man that worked there was nice enough to deliver it to our table. The food was not that great. Everything was salted over the top. I felt like I just had eaten a whole tub of Morton salt. Will probably never go eat there again. Bad service, inferior product and overly priced."}
{"text":"I'll admit it - I have a crush on Bobby, always have.

I had just arrived in town and dumped my suitcase off at the hotel, took off my MN winter clothes and put on my Vegas bumming around clothes and headed out.  It was off peak time, so it was pretty quiet.

I love the fact I do not need to walk a million miles (that's dramatic) through a casino to get to this place.  I like that it's on the street.

I was the only one actually eating a meal and couldn't decide what to get since everything looked good.  I settled on the the Chicken Breast Miami style, a half order of fries and rings (to split) and a diet coke.  We sat at the counter and food took a decent amount of time to arrive.

Sandwich was good size and the sides big enough to split so I'm glad I had a dining companion to finish them up.  My food was decent and I have a feeling if I liked burgers or had ordered a turkey burger I would give it 5 stars.  I got what I needed out of the meal and would go back for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"So good!!! Got the burger of the month with goat cheese. It was amazing. Even better was the burger sauce they provide at your table!  It was so good I wanted to know what was in it. The waitress told me I could buy it and I did!  We have made bbq burgers twice since I got home just so I could use this sauce. When you do buy it it is called barbecue sauce and comes in a glass jar. You can also order it online and I will when we run out!!!"}
{"text":"My Palace Classic burger was cooked the way I ordered, but was incredibly salty. I could only eat half. Fries were good. Onion rings were also salty. Not sure if this location was going through some sort of transition. There were a bunch of boxes in the large front window which looked very messy and awkward. We should have gone to Shake Shack. It was packed when we walked by later unlike this place."}
{"text":"I plan on eating here again. My husband and I ate at the bar, Angel was our server, she was very nice and informative. I had the California burger, it was cooked medium, it was pinker them I usually eat but it tasted good so I didn't complain. The guacamole on it was very good. My husband had the New Mexico burger, he had it cooked medium well, there was no pink and that's  how he likes his burgers. He really enjoyed it. We both had he prickly pear margarita, it was okay. The alcohol level was good but it lacked any distinct flavor. Angel offered us a different flavor but we just kept what we had. We spent $42 for a good size tasty burger and a margarita which isn't bad here."}
{"text":"Yelp says it best = A-OK. The burger patty itself was quite good, as was the bun. We weren't a fan of the toppings available, and the fries were horrible: cold, poorly cut and lacked any sort of seasoning or (on the flipside) memory of what was a potato. 

I know it's \"good-food-served-fast\" but the service was also extremely underwhelming. The young girl at the register looked just thrilled to be employed... *note the sarcasm...*

Food came out pretty quickly, and is reasonably priced.

VERY annoyingly, they don't accept your MLife card there. We had already checked-out so couldn't book to the room. Even Starbucks will take your MLife card... wha? Not a big deal, but a bit annoying.

Either way, A-OK!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Crunchburger, L.A. and Bobby Blue. They were DELICIOUS!! The patties were very juicy and flavorful. Normally I don't finish big burgers but I couldn't help but finish the last 4-5 bites. We will definitely come back! The fries were good but a bit too greasy. The staff was very welcoming. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the good food. It was so simple I was expecting it to be a lot more expensive! When I saw how simple the menu was I was impressed. Good service and food, can't beat it, I would have given 5 stars but something about my burger was a tad salty and the bun wasn't as toasted as I would have liked. The regular fries are good but not amazing as one would expect from a restaurant with such a famous chef. My friend had the Carolina burger and that one was much better than mine! It had just the right amount of sweet but savory enough to balance it out. I ordered the palace classic which was good but plain just American cheese, tomato, lettuce and red onion. Sweet potato fries with honey mustard sauce was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had and for an affordable price. The restaurant was really clean and the design was great! I recommend this to anyone looking for a step up from shake shack and in n out, though it will cost a tad bit more."}
{"text":"Burgers so good they made me want to fight my friends. Five stars for the very testostronous meal."}
{"text":"Bobby should be embarrassed to have his name associated with this place.  We went to Bobby's Burger Palace because of his name.  The burgers are small, dry and tasteless( despite it being cooked medium rare as I ordered).   The onion rings and sweet potato fries were just okay.  I ordered a chopped salad as well-the avocado and watercress were missing, it took about 10 minutes to get it on the side after I brought it to the attention of the staff.  My small dinner salad sized salad ended up being $15 (I added chicken). The burgers start at $10 and the fries are $5 a side.  Ridiculous prices for the poor quality-go to Burger King or Carl's instead.  The only bright spot was the staff.  I feel sorry for them working at a place with such bad food."}
{"text":"Here at 4:00. Had the Carolina burger, onion rings and vanilla shake. Shake was tasty. Carolina burger was like biting into a salt lick. Now all I can taste is salt. The rings are poor, but thick. Wife had fries and a Bobby Blue burger. Said it was also salty but she liked it. I sent it back and complained to the manager. He offered to replace the burger, but my taste buds are all screwed now. Said he would comp our return meal but we leave town Monday and quite frankly I'm afraid to try it again. 

$38.00 for 2 burgers, 2 sides and 2 drinks. Yikes!

Critics say the food channel chefs over season their food. There may be something to this!"}
{"text":"Burgers were not cooked as ordered...fries were just OK.....milkshakes were excellent...service was basically non-existent ....we sat at counter with view of kitchen and door to kitchen...everytime an employee entered/exited the kitchen we were exposed to total filth...dirty cloths on the floor, visible (clear) plastic garbage container that employees dumped drinks/uneaten food as they entered the kitchen....the health sector would go crazy and I can't believe this is what Mr. Flay envisioned when he opened this place...."}
{"text":"My favorite burger and sweet potato fries! Don't hesitate to get a margarita either. The cactus pear margarita isn't overly sweet, and both the original and cactus pear pack a punch. We had our burgers \"topless,\" meaning over a salad and it was all delightful."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent a week in Vegas for our honeymoon.  We ate at many restaurants.  This is the ONLY place we went back to for a second time.  The food was fantastic.  It lived up to Mr. Flay's reputation in every way.  More importantly, the staff were polite, cheerful, and helpful.  This was a significant contrast to other Vegas restaurants where the staff were downright toxic.  We loved eating at BBP Vegas and will make it out first stop next time we come to town."}
{"text":"A casual burger joint directly on the strip that is very convenient if you are staying at the Aria or Cosmo. 

I would say that I didn't find anything overly amazing about the food. The turkey burger at Holstein's in the Cosmo I'd take ANY DAY over the patty at Bobby's Burger. Also, they seemed a bit inflexible as the response to my request for a \"protein-style\" burger was \"no\".

Middle-Of-The-Road Burger...and An Attitude? Not something I need after a hard night on the strip."}
{"text":"We ordered the brunch burger and the LA. Both were incredibly juicy and of course perfectly seasoned.  The burger didn't need anything added to it!  I loved the Jalapeño  sauce though and it gave my burger an extra kick that I loved!  We would definitely come back.  I just wish my burger came with a side of Bobby. ;)"}
{"text":"I had the Bobbie blue burger \"topless\" that is on greens rather than a bun.  Tasty and not expensive.  The ice tea was good. The place was clean and it was easy to get a seat and relax."}
{"text":"I'ma Bobby's fan. I like the speed of their service and that there's enough selection for everyone - but still not too much. I love the potato chips on the burgers touch. Kudos to whomever came how with that idea. 
BBP is like chipotle for burgers. Bigger spaces than Chipotle too. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of days ago with a friend of mine that wanted to try it out. We went for lunch and there was no line, which was nice. I ordered the Carolina burger which is cole slaw on the burger. I order my burger med well and the burger can out well done.  The burger was meat, cheese, and cole slaw with no other toppings. The burger was on the smaller side. Overall, this place is another place to take tourist money, and is not a good example of the quality food that you can get in Vegas."}
{"text":"Burgers were great & different enough to not be just another burger. Sweet potatoe fries were great & love the dipping sauce nice to have something other than ketchup with them. The service we received was great as well. The gentleman was very attentive."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for Cher....which was AWESOME...but this Bobby Flay classic burger that was crunchified ranked right up there with that concert@!@  Juicy...flavorful...soft bun...yummy red onion and creamy cheese.  Needed absolutely NO sauce or ketchup.  Just burger!!  Service was polite..helpful and speedy!  Was there Tuesday January 22 at 4:00pm so I sure hope management reads these reviews because they need to know this was on point!!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious burger here. It was cooked to perfection and good quality. They also had these amazing condiments. I had to keep asking the waiter to bring more. On was the burger sauce. Imagine if steak sauce and barbecue sauce made a baby. Then this homemade honey mustard sauce. Be sure to try the onion rings. Ohhh and the perfect day drink...the frozen margaritas! A must try."}
{"text":"The good:
Average burger
above average toppings
Bacon cheese fries lacked flavor
Onion rings were unique
Portion size was generous but not obscene

The bad:
The restaurant bathroom was very dirty and out of soap
Onion rings, while unique, were bland
Nacho cheese was not good, below average
Dallas burger lacked the advertised crunch
Meat lacked general flavor - no char, no salt/pepper 
Fries were soggy. Almost as though my meal was ore-prepared

Cheap place to eat relative to strip prices ($18 for bacon cheese fries and drink). I am not sure I would return. I would have expected a more flavorful burger and fries that weren't soggy. I doubt this would be acceptable standards when this place was conceptualized."}
{"text":"This is a quick, easy place to get delicious food while on the Las Vegas Strip. Great Burgers! Myself and two other people went here because of my obsession with Food Network/Bobby Flay and got three different burgers and all of shared the same question, \"when were we going to come back again?\".  I personally had the New Mexico Angus Burger that was topped with green chilies, queso and pickled onions. It was cooked exactly how I asked and was extremely flavorful.  Great fries and sauce that came with the burger.  We also had a few drinks from the bar and were satisfied. Staff was friendly and wait times seemed normal. Prices are very reasonable especially with it being on the strip.  I would recommend this to anyone to stop by for a quick bite to eat while on the strip. 

Only one downside:  They said they sold the #flayforall shirts and they told me to come back the next day because they we getting a shipment but when I got back there they were not in stock. :("}
{"text":"A must when you visit vegas! Hands down my favorite cheese fries in town. Go try it! We asked Enzo the manager what burgers to get, and he said we should try the Louisiana burger = super yummy & tasty! I don't usually write yelp reviews but I just had the best time here. The place is big and cozy. Enzo was so kind and very helpful to us we really appreciated it and needed that since we've had such a crappy service experience by the other restaurant that we went to. And Mary in the cashier is very accommodating as well. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The chairs are fun as they swivel and are comfortable. They had fun variety of burgers. The bacon crunch burger was delicious. It comes with chips on top (you can have it on the side) and the bacon was beautifully done-crispy. The sweet potato fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers on the strip. In my opinion it's a good bang for your buck. Especially in Vegas. Get it crunchified. Which means adding chips inside the burger. That's free. Plenty of choices and combinations."}
{"text":"This is our first time here thought it would be great NO I obviously thought wrong I had to wait 10 minutes to get the right things because the fact that they gave me the wrong change to begin with but I'll wait another 10 minutes to get my iced tea on top of that my boys ordered hamburgers we had to wait 18 minutes while the cooks are in the back watching a video on their phone we stopped here because we're like brother is going to be fast it'll get back there on the strip let's see what the manager has to say so I just talked to Jason the manager and he did refund me my money the burgers were good the IC was not so good"}
{"text":"I had lunch here twice after long Vegas nights.  The burgers were well made (not amazing, but well executed) and the service was fast and easy."}
{"text":"We had three different very good burgers and a chruncy salad. Very good value for your money."}
{"text":"Best place in the Strip for an upscale burger.  Good shakes and friendly staff, too.  Locals-- park in the Aria self park lot."}
{"text":"Most amazing burger ever. So much flavor. Had 3 different burgers and sweet potato fries. We all had beef and shared all 3. La burger dalas burger and carolina burger. I expected a lot from this chef and he delivered :)!"}
{"text":"I must say it is tough to get a 5 out of me.  This place however  does it.

Starting off, the outside and inside of the burger restaurant was carefully crafted. Colors are done right.  Has a style if it's own.
Ordering is straight forward.
Burger  -  Drink and sides.
Cost though I  just think was a bit high, but in the end so worth it.
My first time here so I went basic with a little chip crunch on top.
Solid Dark Chocolate Milk Shake and the mix of sweet potato fries and regular fries.

I will start with he fries.  Delectable dish and I had the dijon and horseradish sauce.  Spectacular!
The dark chocolate milkshake was a proverbial happy punch to the stomach that was so good, I wanted more.. Smooth and not overly chocolate.  Just the right amount.

Now the burger, I do love burgers and I have to shout out that the best one I have ever had is at the El Corral in Bogata Colombia.  The beef standards there are so much different and better.  However, BBP does a stellar job of setting the Angus beef standard  there and giving us good quality beef."}
{"text":"The breakfast burger had egg, American cheese and bacon on it.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  The bun was very good too."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the burgers were amazingly delicious. Service was excellent. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"A damn good burger. Price is reasonable typical strip pricing but worth the money.  Staff is friendly and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had the blue burger which was fantastic. Decor was great but our service was what made our time here awesome. My husband left his expensive sunglasses there and we called about an hour later knowing full well they'd probably be gone forever, but John had saved them for us and we were able to pick them up. 
Im a big bobby flay fan and was so excited to try this place out for years and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Service was quick. I went with the topless bobby blue. Best damn burger I've had in a long time. Buttermilk onion rings hit the spot. I'm glad I chose undecided sweet potatoes fries awesome too."}
{"text":"My 3yr old son says:\" Ichiban\" at his first bite of the Brunch burger today. That means yummy in Japanese.  A good medium rare patty and the running egg yolk enhanced all flavors.  The sesame bun is so fresh and just right amount of softness. How can anything not good with a running egg yolk and tender edge burned egg white on top of crispy bacon.  The self service restaurant is neat simple yet stylish. Also a good place to do people watching too.  The last but not the least, their burger sauce is a bomb."}
{"text":"Stopped by always wanted to go and try a bobby flay burger. The food is delicious,the staff was awesome everyone was having a good time and had a smile on there faces. I didn't expect it but one of the staff gave me an application and Im going to turn it in just because everyone made me feel welcome and I would love to work there. If your on the strip and looking for good food, stop here!"}
{"text":"Burger was as salty as this review I'm leaving.

Staff was really awesome, at least. They were incredibly helpful and willing to offer suggestions and such, the food was just...not that good."}
{"text":"I LOVE Bobby Flay, but this was the first of his restaurants that I had ever been to. I went with a group so we all shared the Bobby Burger experience together. The group I was with are very discerning about good food. The results-initially when the burgers were delivered-we thought the burgers are so small for the price, the onion rings look good, not so sure about the fries visually. LOVED those darn onion rings-unmistakeable the best we had all had! The fries-PASS!!!! Lemonades-FRESH & DELICIOUS! The small burgers-TASTY, FLAVORFUL, JUICY & FILLING!! No complaints after we ate our burgers-good tasting meat! 

Great experience with service too! The service from all of the staff was attentive and made us feel at home in Vegas. Service exceeded that of a burger place for sure!!!!! 

Bobby's Burger Palace- I will see you later this year!"}
{"text":"Just spent 7 hours on a plane and a burger and fries sounded good.  Flay's place was just a short walk. I tried the crunch bacon burger and it was very good. The fries not so much. Most places seem to think the fries are an afterthought and Bobby's was no different First order fries on top were cold. Second order the ones on top are just over room temperature so I dumped them out of container thinking maybe I could find some hot ones. No luck. Consistent temp throughout."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Thursday night. The place looks super modern inside, the service was great and the food even better. Will definitely eat there again,"}
{"text":"Absolutely legit burger, but $16 for fries and a burger roughly the size of a double quarter pounder?  I know all these celebrity chefs want in on blue collar casual dining right now, but c'mon Bobby, 16 bucks? 2 stars because of ripoff ratio. Fatburger is very nearly as good, half the price, and is also nearby on the strip."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! The layout is disappointing as we walked in a door no greeting or clue where to go - had to ask what to do. The seating is bar style very cramped. Service was ok not exceptional.  Would come back for food ."}
{"text":"I had the blue cheese burger and onion rings. It was flavorful and good quality but honestly overpriced like most restaurants in Vegas. The decor is outdated but the burger was satisfying."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here and try Bobby Flay's burgers and I was slightly disappointed. 

The pros: the patty was cooked to a nice medium rare, which is what I asked for. The patty was tender and juicy. The onion rings were lightly battered and were fried to perfection. The cookies'n cream shake was smooth and not too sweet as well.

The cons: I got the Crunchburger and it was made just like any other burger. My burger was accompanied with a slice of American Cheese and a handful of potato chips. Yes, it was good, but it was not special. It was not memorable and and the burger was dry. I added some chipotle ketchup to it (which was one of the five sauces that was placed on the tables), and it added some flavor to it. The burger seemed overpriced for the mere simplicity and blandness of the overall burger. As for the sweet potato fries, they were a bit limp and bland as well. It was accompanied by a honey mustard and a ranch dipping sauce, but neither matched well with these fires. A sweeter ketchup may have been a better match to these fries. 

Overall, the patty was delicious but the rest of the burger fell short. If you come here, maybe opt for a burger with more dressings on top."}
{"text":"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby! I am a huge fan, I really wanted to enjoy the place. My friends were upset that we spent money at Bobby's when we could have had a better and cheaper burger across the street at Fatburger. 

First off, the price was a little much and what do you mean fries aren't included? 

Second, The New Mexico burger does not have New Mexico chile??? Yes chile with an E. Authentic Hatch green chile would actually made this a New Mexico Burger. Plus queso blanco on a burger? No, no, no I know you have been to New Mexico it is regular cheddar when doing a queso burger please!! 

Upsides were that my burger was cooked perfectly and I had a delicious margarita. But I will  forever be disappointed in you Bobby. Maybe I will try Mesa Grill and see if you can win back my heart."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate during my stay in Las Vegas. 5 stars! The burger, I ordered the bacon crunchburger medium with an order of regular fries, was arguably the best burger I've ever had. I sat at the bar around 12pm and ordered a margarita on the rocks and it was strong and delicious. The bartender, Tiffany, was extremely helpful and wonderful with her advice and bar tending experience. Highly recommend for your quick lunch stop while wandering around the strip."}
{"text":"I got the beef classic burger in medium well and the patty  was slightly burnt ( disappointed), I also got the regular fries and it was too salty.  The staff were nice. There was also a small line and only one cashier."}
{"text":"The good: Best Onion Rings I've ever had, fries better than they looked, service at bar was perfect - attentive but not intrusive.

The Bad: Dallas Burger was ok but the BBQ Sauce was abhorrently bad, some bizarre smoke filled musty burnt flavor. The burger patty itself was fine but small and not exceptional."}
{"text":"As a fan of the Bobby Flay tv shows, I had high expectations for the burgers at his restaurant. The Northwest burger was very good and juicy, a tad rich. Did not care for any of the 5 sauces you could add to the burger. My wife had the Dallas, she liked the slaw on it, but the sauce tasted bitter. Needed something vinegary to cut the richness. The fries were very disappointingly average and limp. The onion rings needed more crunch. My wife and I went around 1:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday afternoon, and there were only 2 waitresses to serve the entire restaurant. They were scurrying around like squirrels. They also needed an additional person to take orders. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Give me In N Out Burgers anyday."}
{"text":"Wife and I were craving a burger so decided to give Bobby's Burger Palace a try.  The wait staff was extremely friendly but the host Briana who took our order not so much. She had a major attitude but we decided to eat here anyway. I ordered the Philadelphia burger which came with some super hot peppers.  The burgers were cooked to perfection and the sweet potato fries are some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for burgers."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Bobby's burgers. But it wasn't up to par. We ordered a Brunch burger that came with a fried egg. When the burger came out it looked as if someone had put their whole body weight on it and stuck two skewers in it. Barely appetizing at best. Then without any condiments the meat wasn't well seasoned, it had good char flavor, but so does burger king. Overall, not worth the $12 dollars."}
{"text":"Simply the best burger I've ever had. I ordered the Crunchburger well done and it was nothing less than perfect. I also ordered a side of fries and a soda. The price isn't the most reasonable as my bill came to be over $16. There's a variety of sauces at your table, my favorite being the Burger Sauce. There was also a chipotle ketchup and a jalapeño sauce. My girlfriend ordered the Dallas burger which she loved. It came topped with coleslaw. She also mentioned that the sweet potato fries were the best she's ever eaten. The only thing that could have made this better, would have been the chance to meet Mr. Bobby Flay himself!"}
{"text":"We wanted a fairly quick and reasonably dinner, so we decided to try out BBP.  The young woman taking our order was quite helpful.  The only downside to our ordering is that they were out of mint for the mint&chip shake.  Once we sat down a different young lady brought us our silverware.  She asked us how we were doing, and when we reciprocated, her response was, \"I feel really sick and wish I wasn't here.\"  WTheck?  After handling our eating utensils you tell us that you're sick?  (-1 star)  Needless to say, we needed to find new silverware.  The burgers were very good, as were the onion rings.  The rings are huge, so there is quite a bit of breading, as mentioned by other reviewers; however, the spices are really good!  The fries were WAY overcooked, so we didn't eat many of those.  The salad was okay - nothing wrong with it, just not to the flavor likings of the person who ordered it.  Shakes were great, but small."}
{"text":"Good job Bobby!
We have been here a few times on our Vegas visits and it is always good. 
Burger is always fresh and cooked to perfection. The meat is so tender. The fries always taste fresh cut. I will say this time it was all a little too greasy but still delicious! 
I so enjoy this burger place and I'm not a burger person.  
Service was great!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Grill Cheese good too. Shake (Pistachio) is better!  Combo Fries very tasty.  Counter service. Friendly accommodating staff. Excellent location on strip. Overall recommended for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Burgers were fantastic!!! Sauces were all amazing. Then to top it all off the service Nate provided was fantastic! Kudos Bobby Flay for great food and a great team. #flayforall"}
{"text":"Fast service. Cool place. About 10 bucks for burger. Fries extra. Shareable portion of fries.  Clean. Friendly."}
{"text":"Great overall experience. Service was very friendly and food was relatively quick.  My burger was excellent (the Dallas with slaw).  For a side, I ordered the 1/2 fries & 1/2 onion rings. The fries were good but the onion rings were great. The were humongous, both in width and thickness. I've never had rings that were that thick.

The ordering process was nice and quick too, where you order & pay at the counter and they give you a number.  Your prepared food is brought out to you. I liked the seating that the majority was like counter seating with some tables in S and U shapes."}
{"text":"Love the location if your looking for something else to fulfill your cravings after going to Nobu If you didn't buy a lot .These burgers are out of this world even though they are my 2nd most expensive burger so far in my life. The milkshakes rival (good way)what you can get in those great Highschool manned joints.The burger sauces are very unique form Yellow Mustard,Chipotle Ketchup,Jalapeno,BBQ and of course ketchup.Lines are relatively short love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good burger and very reasonably priced. Great location right of the strip and the customer service hit a home run. Didn't try fries or other sides but they looked well prepared and delicious. Give it a whirl on you Vegas buffet tour."}
{"text":"Ordered the mint chocolate chip shake as a snack.  The cashier was confused regarding how to use the \"charge to any MGM property room\" machine, but she figured it out.  The second cashier/employee next to her was very friendly, and I had a nice, short conversation with him while waiting for her to sort things out.

My mint chocolate chip shake had a very strong, pleasant vanilla extract-like flavor.  The mint was not super strong, but was a nice aftertaste.

Not a fan of the communal seating, but it wasn't crowded so I could be by myself.  There was construction on the front half of the dining area, where one of the employees said they were going to install a bar.  I found it mildly entertaining that there was a Pizza Hut box prominently situated against the window both days I walked by.

I'd go back to try their food.  Good job, Bobby Flay."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Best burger I've had in a while - and a yummy vanilla shake to go with it! A definite do over next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"We visited while on our anniversary and wanted a quick bite to eat, Damian was VERY helpful! He left his post at the host stand to make sure we and every other guest in the building were taken care of! Very friendly and very attentive! All five stars are for the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers, chicken and sweet potato fries. Love this place and the service. Considering how my hotel the Aria charges triple for everything, it was great to walk down here and have a good meal for less than weeks wages. If you are near the strip make sure you go. Rachel, the server at the bar during the day is great and very customer service oriented. Thanks for the good food and hospitality!!"}
{"text":"We tried the New Mexico burger and the Dallas burger... both on point! So good!! Cooked perfectly and a side of bacon cheese fries! Got some drinks at the bar and was super happy with the service!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place many times on my way to Crystals/Cosmo and finally decided to give this place a try.  Glad I did! It's a pretty decent place to come in for a quick bite.  You order and get a number and the servers come on by to give you your meal.  I really enjoyed the open seating area and the decor.  My bf got the Dallas burger and it was really flavorful, try it with the chipotle ketchup! I got the Breakfast burger since I love fried eggs in my burger and it was also pretty good as well.  I do have to admit that the Dallas burger definitely outshined my breakfast burger.  Portions are reasonable and filling and surprisingly enough, the burger didn't leave me feeling heavy and sleepy.  

Don't forget that their specialty is to make their burgers *Crunchified*!  We almost forgot to request for it since we thought all the burgers here were made *crunchified*.  There's no extra cost for it and it sure does make a huge difference in the burger.  The texture adds to the whole experience of the burger.  Also, don't forget to try the sauces that they have at the tables.  Overall, Bobby's Burger Palace has good burgers at decent prices.  I don't think it's anywhere near the one of the best burgers that I've had but for the convenience, price and quickness, it's good place to try."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers, the fries, the sweet potato fries, the sauces for the burgers, and the dips for the fries. Just great food. Service was great and quick! I am a fan!!"}
{"text":"This place was a total disappointment. Only reason it gets a two star from me is because of The owners name. Although the burgers were good the men's bathroom was nasty. Unsanitary. If the health department would have checked out this place on random inspection , they would have shut the place down. 
Hope they read this and fix the problem."}
{"text":"Hallelujah! It's finally happened Vegas. I have finally found my favorite bacon, egg, and cheese burger!

It's a really cool setup. Lots of unique lights and fun wave shaped counters. The chair were uncomfortable though. And far away from the counters.  You order at a counter and then find a place to sit.  Someone will bring your food out. 

I ordered the Brunch Burger cooked medium. Angus beef, over medium egg, American cheese, and bacon. Pure deliciousness. And actually cooked to a medium!! (They have a burger temperature chart at the register when you order. Smart) I have found that the bacon on burgers usually isn't all that great. This one proved me wrong. My egg was actually still runny, the way it should be.  And the cheese... It was actually melted and delicious.  It seriously like exploded in my mouth. 

My boyfriend ordered the Vegas burger and raved about it forever. He loves his burger medium rare, but usually doesn't receive it this way. For once, he did. It was still dripping and all. His mom ordered the New Mexico burger and also loved it.

They have a bunch of different sauces at the counters: chipotle ketchup, burger sauce, jalapeño hot sauce, fry sauce, etc.

The only thing we didn't enjoy were the fries. Both the regular and sweet potato fries were overcooked. We did 1/2 regular fries and 1/2 onion rings for one order. It only came with two (delicious) onion rings :/ 

Bobby Flay himself was there. We went over and said hi.

Service was extremely attentive. Plates were cleared quickly, refills were offered even though it's self service, etc. 

3 burgers, 2 sodas, 1 bottled water, 1/2 fries & onion rings, and sweet potato fries = $47

Will return!"}
{"text":"Good burgers -not great- but good. A tad over salted. Good concept, flavores, and all burgers are cooked to the correct (custom) level of doneness. But I expect a bit more from a name like bobby flay. He could improve here. 

Plan on spending 40$ for 2 burgers , 2 beers, and fries ."}
{"text":"Overall decent food experience. Nice to try but wouldn't say it's a must stop in Vegas. I had the Nuevo Mexico burger which had a good amount of flavor. The fries, both reg & sweet potato were good & so were the onion rings. Only 2 onion rings came w/ the 50/50 order so that was disappointing. None of us cared for the buns/bread, they were thin & cold. We had shakes too & those were pretty good, really creamy but a little pricey for the size. Customer service was good overall. I was expecting more with the Bobby Flay name but I left with a happy stomach. I've had better & worse, but glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick meal on the Strip. Prices are great for the Strip and the burgers are tremendous. They aren't huge but normal sized burgers. I love to get mine cruchified with potato chips.  The Bobby Bleu is my favorite but I've tried most of them. Fries are solid. Onion rings are exceptional."}
{"text":"A great recommendation from our cab driver. Onion rings are a must...the sauce is one of a kind. My husband and I both got a burger and shared the onion rings and sweet potatoe fries...the sauces were so good. The burgers with potato chips on them were unique and cooked perfectly. The pickle pulled the whole burger together"}
{"text":"Stopped here about a week ago during lunch time. First thing you see is a big menu. By big I mean the big board that displayed it. The menu is easy to order off of. Everything is a la carte. I got the brunch burger, sweet potato fries, the wife got the philly, two soft drinks. It was a little over 30 bucks, a bit on the spendy side but this is the Vegas Strip. 

Both burgers were cooked to our liking. The flavors of both burgers was really flavorful. The philly had the philly steak taste, the brunch burger was my first burger with an egg on it, yum! The sweet potato fries was really crispy on the outside and sweet yumminess on the inside. There was 4 choices of sauces, don't remember what they were but didn't really care for it. 

The staff was really nice, the restaurant was clean and spacious. Definitely worth a visit when on the strip!"}
{"text":"Overall- Good spot for a tasty burger. 

Being from Chicago (we take our beef seriously) this place is not bad. Ordered up a  the Brunch Burger (fried egg, bacon, and cheddar cheese). Burger was cooked to specification, medium, which left the burger still juicy and a warm pink. I will say that with the egg and bacon, the salt content was a bit much. My overall score is a three out of five. Will dine here again if I'm on the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"A million stars from me to you Bobby! My recent trip to Vegas was the best and your restaurant made a big difference in my trip and put a huge smile in my face, I wanted to see you!
I had been wanting to visit your place for the longest time. I am a huge fan of you and all your shows, I wish I could do a Beat Bobby Flay with you, I know you would beat me any day and that would be okay with me.
Your green chili burger was amazing as was my daughters classic burger. The meat was cooked and seasoned to perfection and the fries and onion rings were just divine! My green chile burger was so amazingly delicious and beautiful with the red grilled onions on top.
I hope to come back soon and visit your other restaurant and try your tamales and other spectacular dishes, it's on my bucket list;)
Bobby, you're the best, you don't know how much it meant to me to visit your restaurant.
There's a dish in Guadalajara called \"carne en su jugo\", I think it's something you might like to try! 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"We ate here on 03/12/2018.  Good solid burgers.  I had the New Mexico burger (queso, green chiles, and pickled red onions) medium rare and onion rings.  Food arrived quickly.  My only complaint of the burger was that the bun got soggy.

Onion rings were very good.  They went great with the chipotle ketchup.  My wife and son had the basic cheeseburgers and fries.  Fries were nothing special.  The dipping sauce that came with them was not as good as the chipotle ketchup.  

Service was not especially attentive.  I ran out of iced tea and had to refill my own drink with coke.  $61+ for three burgers, fries, rings, drinks, and a chocolate shake is pretty steep, but it is the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and the burgers are awesome! The meat tastes like meat before all the hormones. I felt like I was eating from a healthy, clean cow lol. Customer service was also an A+, the servers made sure we had everything we needed and that our food was made to perfection. I hope they build one in San Diego."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Highly recommend. The angus meat is so fresh. The burger was cooked perfectly, with great flavor. Seeded bun soft and fresh."}
{"text":"Wow--Bobby's chain has it down so well you'll forget it's a chain. The burgers are hot, flavorful, and served with great drinks at a great bar. 

The sauces enhance the experience and the sides are phenomenal. 

Worth the buck too, not too expensive for the strip. Would eat here every day if I ate beef that much. A must."}
{"text":"Here is the 3-1-1: 

Food: As king of the Flava's the burger was ok; as watching many of his shows I was expecting a lot more but the burger was a little under seasoned however the toasted sesame bun and the free addition of kettle chips in the burger added were nice touches. I had the Dallas burger which was loaded with coleslaw, bbq sauce and like I said it was fine but was not \"wow-d\". The fries were ok, a little limp but not bad overall as the portion size was decent. Decent oreo milkshake as it was enough to be shared for 2.

Service: Walk up counter to order and food is brought out to your table, no-frills. The hostess taking your order was great in that she gave a lot of info on the options and what was her favorites. The servers were helpful and attentive as dropped napkins were picked up immediately and tables were busted quickly as well them checking in once your food was brought to you.

Ambiance: Plenty of seating as the counters were set up as \"S\" community seatings but enough elbow room between stools. Bright décor and very inviting."}
{"text":"Nice burger place in a convenient location on the strip.  Beats cabbing it out to In n Out.  Burgers are a solid offering - I've had at least 3 different kinds.  Fries are plentiful and great quality.  Great sauces.  Cool, relaxing atmosphere to get out of the Vegas heat.  Eaten here 3 times."}
{"text":"A+ for the food! C- for the service. The lady that took our order didn't seem to know what she was doing. She took forever. Then forgot to charge us for one burger and had to ring it up separately. Not a huge deal, but a bit inconvenient. The green Chile burger is delicious! As well as the basil one (mulberry street) for the burger of the month! We love Bobby Flay so I definitely recommend trying this place while visiting Vegas. The milkshakes are delicious. It's definitely a more expensive burger restaurant but still worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly service and A+ on food quality. Great taste for a quick dining experience. Would be happy to come eat here again and try a different creation. I wish they had sauteed mushrooms on offer too."}
{"text":"If you can cross the street. Do it. Not worth the wait or money. Small portions. Bobby sucks."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Ordered the burger salad,the salad was good, the burger was raw and cold. My husband ordered his burger medium rare and it came out well.  The fries were greasy and Luke warm. A lot if $$$ for a meal that left us hungry. The wait staff were willing to help out and refunded the cost of the raw salad burger. 
I would not try this place again. Too many other great burger places in town."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Been looking forward to going here but it was all hype. 
Way too expensive. Very bland. And portions are small. Shakes are runny. 
Their medium-rare was more like rare. Very soggy. 
Boyfriend got the runs after eating here."}
{"text":"Wandered into this place on a whim. We had reservations for dinner at Le Cirque (in Bellagio) in about four hours, but we hadn't eaten lunch and happened upon Bobby's Burger Palace. 

When we walked in the door, I wasn't even aware that this was Bobby Flay's place. Added bonus!

The burger menu was eclectic, with options ranging from \"comfort food\" to \"way out there\". I opted for the Crunchburger (American cheese, topped with potato chips), while my spouse chose the Carolina (smoked American cheese, green onion slaw, mustard BBQ sauce). We added a side of regular fries and split a pistachio milkshake. 

The verdict? Delectable! 

I could have eaten two of the burgers - they were hot, juicy and delicious. I half-expected the potato chips to be something exotic or fancy (like a kettle chip), but I'd swear that they used classic Lay's Potato Chips. I was delighted by this, and it turned out to be (by far) the cheapest meal we had during a long Vegas weekend."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday. We needed a quick bite. I had Bubby Flay burger last time I was in Vegas and it was great. But this time my burger tasted funny and when I looked inside, my burger was burned. It look like they didn't even clean the grill well and a lot of burned pieces were stuck to my burger. Will not go back and do not recommend this place. Look at picture attached."}
{"text":"The food is okay but I think the habit or burger city Grill is better. You're paying for a name."}
{"text":"Got the crunch burger and was cooked perfectly.  good taste, 2 pieces of american cheese came on the burger and the cheese tasted of quality.  I took the chips off but the burger tasted good.  I would expect a bit more from a flay eatery but it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"My friends and I loved this place! We had spent 35/person at Burger Bar by Hubert Keller and it was nothing special. We've been to Burgr, which was great until they burnt my burger and made me feel like i didn't know what a burnt burger was. So i'd consider BBP cheap for being on the strip and having the Bobby Flay name. I think the burgers are simple and smart. Some burgers try to be so much and miss the fact that it is a burger. I had the Vegas and the kick from the chiles were awesome! The shakes were delicious and our friends had the adult shakes. There was a major kick from those things unlike the ones they had at Burger Bar. you couldn't taste the liquor, but these ones were strong...and cheaper. I probably would've eaten another one."}
{"text":"Love Bobby's shows and burger was excellent. 
Worst service we've had in Vegas. Took 40 min,
yes 40 min to get a cheeseburger and shake. 
Restaurant wasn't even 1/2 full since we went at
off time so can't imagine how slow these idiots
would be if packed. 
I asked my waitress who was a little Asian girl with 
braces where my shake was 30 min in and she looked
at me like I asked her to solve a riddle. She said let me
check and never returned."}
{"text":"Was hoping to get an awesome burger and an even better dining experience.  Instead got a very good burger and a dining experience like going to Carl's Jr.  You order your food and then they bring some of it to you while forgetting some parts...like your drinks.  So actually Carl's Jr.  has better service since you get your drink when you pay.  
    The food was very good...burger was cooked perfectly and fries were good.  Ordered \"half and half\" - half fries half onion rings.  Only got 2 onion rings....does this mean each onion ring cost $1?  Since a full order is $4...
    Service was not what I would have expected.  When food was brought out drinks weren't brought at same time...another trip had to be made.  Then it took 2 people to bring a cup of water after asking for it.  Soda machine available for refills but no iced tea at soda station...had to ask for that refill too.  
    If you just want good burgers then this place is pretty good....albeit a little pricey.  If you want a great dining experience where you feel like you matter as a customer...there's several places where you'll get better service."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! Lena was our server/bartender and she gave us the best service we had during our trip to Vegas. Really on point, friendly, quick service and offered great recommendations. I got the Dallas burger and it was cooked to perfection, and the pickle on the side was deliciously crisp too. 11/10 would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not my kinda place. Hated the guacamole, it tasted just like onions. Fries were no good either."}
{"text":"Had the classic burger- cooked medium- what a deliciously juicy yummy satisfying treat! Cooked perfectly. Reasonable prices. Choice of meat for burger from angus beef, ground turkey or chicken breast; I had the beef. Veggie burger as well as grilled cheese available. Went on a Wednesday around 3pm and there wasn't a line and plenty of seating. Fries, onion rings, shakes and malts also on menu. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Note: If you've never eaten here before like myself, and are staying at the Mandarin Oriental and come in through the backdoor nearest The Mandarin, don't make the mistake I did by thinking it was a sit down restaurant with a waitress. You have to either order from the bar, or up front with the register and then they bring the food out to you. There are no signs in the backdoor area telling you this.  

The burger was delicious. The shakes are great too. The fact that you can make them boozy shakes is even better. The sweet potato fries were good but swimming in salt. The choices between burger, turkey burger or chicken patty for your sandwich were good choices."}
{"text":"I was not pleased with this place. 
#1 it is very expensive to be a regular burger joint ( located on the strip or not). I paid $16 for burger and fries/ onion rings (3 large).
#2 for the amount of money presentation should be better. The bacon was not done ( it was see through). And the fries were cold ( why? When they were under the onion rings). I politely asked if I could get well done bacon. They returned with burnt bacon and it was extremely salty. 
Needless to say is I won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.

We entered establishment @ 10 pm and was told by the rude cashier that they were doing takeout orders only.  I said your sign says open to midnight, to which I did not geta reply. So we decided to stay anyways and eat there. When I got the burger and fries I ordered, the meat patty was raw and both the fries and burger were coated in at least a cup of salt.  Sorry Bobby, your staff is ruining your name at this location."}
{"text":"Must have  milk shakes! Don't ask for ranch they don't have it! Haha.. The brunch burger was really good! Fried egg in the burger was a delight!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Bobby Flay.  And because of that - I was pretty sure that my hopes were too high for his burgers.  I had the Palace Classic - American cheese, lettuce, tomato and red onion.  You can pick beef, turkey or chicken.  For beef - you can choose temp of burger.  I had a medium burger and it did not disappoint! It was the seasoning of the burger itself.   The toppings are just toppings but if the burger can stand alone - then it's a good burger.  Also tried the bacon cheese fries.  Yum! Overall - excellent quick meal right on the Strip!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of menu options.  I had the Crunchburger. What could be better than having your chips IN your sandwich? Yummy. I also had the spiked vanilla shake.  It was pretty rich and filling. I couldn't finish it.  This was on the pricey side for burgers and fries, but I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Third burger joint in Las Vegas and we finally have a winner! 
Granted it is more fast food than a restaurant, but the atmosphere is so much better here than the other places we've tried.
The burger was excellent, just as good as the one I had at Fat Choy. Much better selection of toppings than either of the other places. 
Beer choices were decent. I do wish they had local choices though.
It's also a great place to sit and people watch."}
{"text":"Just had this yesterday. Trying to keep up with all my reviews. I figured I do a quick one for Bobby's flay burger joint.

It's more like a 2.5 for me but I'll round it up because Lola our waitress+bartender was doing a great job attending to the 8 of us. 

I had the Brunch burger which was a burger that consist of egg + bacon + chips(if you want it to) and of course the patty. Bobby's burger palace makes their burger more into a classic american burger. It kinda left something to be desired for. I would say that the patty was actually juicy but everything else in my burger was so so. The egg was dry, I thought it would be yolky... the bacon wasn't crispy enough. The chips taste like lays but never had it in a burger before(which was aite). Kinda nice to have that crunch that the bacon lacked. The bun was most disappointing. 

We had the combination of fries + onion rings. I thought the onion ring wasn't bad. The fries could be better but it wasn't terrible.

I probably wouldn't come back but I still kinda prefer this place over shake shack. The price is around $10 per burger. With that said, I probably wouldn't return to either one."}
{"text":"We grabbed lunch here and LOVED it!  Delicious food!!!  Fun and modern environment!

I had the turkey burger, which they managed to keep moist!  :D  Wonderful!

I also enjoyed the onion rings and strawberry shake.  DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Little disappointed. I was expecting something big with the name Bobby Flay attached to it. First of all I'm a huge Bobby Flay fan. Love his shows and I've taken my wife to eat at his Mesa Grill restaurant in Vegas, which by the way was excellent. With this current visit to Vegas with my wife we made it a point to eat at BBP. As we started our walk to the restaurant from the NY NY we passed by one burger place that had a line out the door. We both said \"wow, its a busy night tonight\". When we reached BBP and walked in there was only a handful of customers eating. Didn't think much of it at first and we proceeded to place our orders. I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger and my wife ordered the Maimi Burger. As we sat there waiting for our order to come out I immediately noticed the floors looked like they hadn't been swept for at lest a few hours. Straw wrappers, bread crumds and used napkins littered around the tables. There is a view of the cooks who seemed to be muching on food as they worked over the grill. Not good. The wait for the burgers wasn't an issue but the first thing I noticed when it came out was the size. For a $10 burger I was expecting something big. It was average sized, comparable to something you'd get from Wendy's. Immediately disappointed. Well it better taste amazing then. It was again average, nothing special. It wasn't bad but I was expecting Chef Flay amazing. I was starting to understand why BBP was pretty empty with customers and the place just down the road was packed. Hmmm, next trip we'll be trying that other place."}
{"text":"Excellent! Very efficient and attention at the bar was awesome. I wanted to watch my team's game so I asked the bartender to change the channel and immediately did it. He was very nice and the food was amazing. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great quick burgers and at a great price. Wanted to try this one for a while and it was worth it. Only other comment i have is the New Mexico Burger isn't a true New Mexico burger. It seems to have chopped jalapeños instead of green chile.  Not sure if they ran out and had to substitute or what but burger was still great."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers, friendly staff, casual dining.  Perfect!  I ate at several \"celebrity\" establishments on my last trip to Vegas, and this is the one I'd go to first next time!  This is a don't miss kinda place!"}
{"text":"The first word to come in mind while I was eating my juicy \"Dallas\" burger was wow. The burger was cooked to perfection it had the right amount of seasoning and a very tasty bbq sauce. The customer service is very good as well. Definitely a must while your in Vegas !"}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to try his burger restaurant after having such a good meal at his Mesa Grill. I ordered the Bobby Blue because they did not have any mushrooms in the building and couldnt make my mushroom/swiss burger. Odd that there were no mushrooms in the house.  My wife ordered the Brunch Burger. Again our expectations were high. My burger was bland, needed seasons
g and small. The burger had slid off the bun before i received it and the blue cheese melted off the burger and was on the plate in its entirety, none left on the burger. There was one small piece of lettuce, one small piece of onion barely discernable. I ordered the sweet potato fries and they were very good. 

My wifes Brunch Burger was good. Again we were excited to try a Bobby Flay burger. Her cheese fries were cold and had to be sent back. 

We had milkskakes for dessert and they were unbelievable. Bobby change it to a Shake Shop instead of burger joint. Your place couldnt hold a candle to Stripe Burgers in the Elara Shop area."}
{"text":"A great burger at a very reasonable price... In fact it was the cost here that surprised me.
Service is mostly like a fast casual.  You order at the desk and then take a seat in a slightly community setting and they bring food to you.  Given the brand name and location on the strip I was shocked that I could eat a great lunch hear with my wife for $30.  The burgers are well prepared and all come with a signature sauce that sets them apart a bit.  The sides are more than big enough to share.  I find the \"crunchified\" version adds some nice texture and saltiness already.

If you're looking for a high quality hangover killer on this end of the strip stop in for lunch.

For the question of liquor - the offer a selection of a few beers, wines, and margarittas."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe here.  The interior design is playful and I like the community benches all around.  It's not a fancy sit-down place, that you might expect from Bobby Flay.  Their prices are reasonable, considering all the other high priced burger joints in Vegas.  The quality of the meat was really good.  

I enjoyed the Classic Burger, which was cooked perfectly.  Ordered the combo fries and sweet potato fries.  I'd probably just order the fries next time, since they were delish.  I like my fries crispy, which is what you get here.  I like that the ketchup, mustard, chipotle ketchup, BBQ sauce and jalapeno hot sauce are available on the side.  This allows you to control what and how much you add to your burger.  I liked the chipotle ketchup and as expected the jalapeno hot sauce had a nice kick to it.

It's not the biggest burger in Vegas, but it's solid."}
{"text":"Best Onion rings I've ever had at a restaurant I'm not iting you. The onions were seasoned I think, it wasn't just batter and huge onion. 
  I had an amazing Turkey burger and my best man had a really good Palace burger. 
  I also had fountain ginger ale for the first time as far as I know. (Wait so there's a pager emoji but not a fountain drink emoji? ) hmm. 
   Anyway not pricey because you get what you pay for and I've paid more for less and worse combined"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG! This place makes me wish I lived in Vegas. The only upside of our four hour flight delay heading out of town is that we were able to have another meal at BBP. 

I had the Vegas burger both times and the husband tried the Santa Fe and the Dallas. Everything was cooked to perfection, the fries were delish, and the vanilla milkshake was heavenly. Seriously. The service was as good as the food, everyone was friendly and professional. This place sets a high bar and it will be my first stop next time I get to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great burger. I had the Vegas Burger, white American, red chilies & BBQ chips, wow, a side of the sweet potato fries with their honey mustard horseradish dipping sauce was heaven."}
{"text":"So Mr flay is a famous chef. Wonder if he ever comes in and tastes his burgers as an anonymous customer. It obvious he is in it for money nd not to give good food to his customer. Deceitful especially when a known chef serves such junk. Order veggie burger nd after firsr bite, it crumbled. I was left with a plate full of crumbles, a burger that can't hold its center!!! Nd that's his creation. Mr Flay, take time to go eat like us nd experience  the disappointment firsthand. Vegas has better burgers."}
{"text":"We went at 6pm on a Saturday night and the place was half empty. But after wading through masses of crowds all day and bleary eyed from cigarette smoke, this was a warm and welcome oasis! (I could hear myself think and relax without any bumbling, drunk idiots further north on the Strip.) I ordered the Dallas angus beef burger with the \"can't decide\" - sweet potato fries and onion rings. My daughter ordered the kid-friendly crunch burger. Great that you can choose ground turkey or chicken breast, in addition to the angus beef, which was a perfectly juicy medium-well.  Loved the various sauces Bobby Flay's known for: spicy jalapeño, creamy BBQ, smoky chipotle ketchup, sweet mustard, and even the ranch was the best I've ever tasted! The onion rings were crispy with a nice, peppery crunch. I also got the frozen pink margarita- it had a very smoothly blended ice texture, and was so delicious! My burger was a scrumptious balance of sweet, tangy, and spicy. Total tab without the tip for two burgers, regular fries, the \"can't decide\", a bottle of water, and margarita, was $42. I'd say this place seemed really kid friendly, could be a cozy date place, and the long tables were great for large groups of family or friends. The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is due to the soggy, thin, bottom bun. I took it off because it was overly mushy from all the juices that came out of my burger. The service was attentive and excellent."}
{"text":"I had read online about this place, and the burgers with the potato chips served on top (which they call \"crunchified). Well, I cannot say enough good things about this place. The cashier that took our order was very friendly and was able to answer my questions. Our food came out in a very timely manner, and was cooked exactly the way that I wanted. The ambiance is great - very modern and trendy! Overall, a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"I went in and expecting a lot of hype and nothing more than a burger like any other burger. However I was pleasantly surprised and have to admit it was an amazing burger. The onion rings and French fries were also really, really good. I would definitely come back here again and think it is worth the ~$20 for a burger, fries, and soda. The design of the place is modern and cozy, yet has a retro feel in its DNA. 

One thing that disappointed me however, is that it participated in that strange tipping culture that's somewhat popular in Vegas. I waited about 7 minutes in line to give my order to the lady at the register/counter, which is fine. However as I'm giving her my credit card to pay, she asks me if I would like to leave a tip. I haven't received the product or the service yet and I'm being asked if I want to leave a tip?? A little annoyed, I said no."}
{"text":"Since it's located within a walking distance from our place, and we had a good experience at Bobby Flay's other restaurant, Mesa Grill, we decided to have lunch there.

We had Crunchburger and Carolina, with onion rings and fries. Taste was OK. Pretty inexpensive considering it's in City Center and on the Strip. Pickles were good. Decor was neat.

We'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Ordered and waited for over 45 minutes, fries were deeper in Oil and burger less than average, flavorless and soggy bread, shame BF name is at the door"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Burger was cooked exactly as I ordered and tasted good. But the sides were the best part. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were both amazing. 

It's also nice that the food only took about 5 minutes. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place only 3 stars, but with so many wonderful culinary experiences in Vegas it is only fair.
 
Listen I'm a Bobby Flay fan!! Every Throwdown or showdown he competes in I always want him to win, I mean he's Bobby Flay!! He made Foodnetwork famous, he is great on every show, Brunch with Bobby always makes me hungry.

As for Burger Palace, it is good. It's convenient, and very casual.  Not the fancy prestige of Burgr (which I love) So if you are in the mood for fast no fuss food, it will deliver.  But this is Vegas, so you expect a little glitz and glam, not here. The most glam they offer is a multitude of sauces on the table.  I enjoyed the sweet potato fries and their honey mustard sauce, I also had a feta salad which was interesting and generous on the avocado, all positive aspects. But onto the burgers, the best way to describe them is as a good burger from your friend's backyard BBQ. You know the charred, slightly dry taste, on an underwhelming bun, but you eat it and enjoy it because you are in good company, that's how they taste. 
We also got a black and white milkshake, again it was good, about as good store brand vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup will taste.
Bottom line, nothing fancy or memorable especially for its location, but you will enjoy it anyway because you are in the company of Bobby Flay!"}
{"text":"It wasn't the best burger, but it wasn't the worst either.  The service was decent. The servers (who come into play only after you order at the counter) checked in with us and seemed pleasant for their brief appearance.  

The food came out relatively fast, however, the meals in our group came out staggered with a few minute delay in-between.  It also seemed like some meals   spent way too much time sitting on the counter under a heat lamp.  I spied my burger and fries sitting there for about 4 minutes, which is disappointing when you're hungry (and want freshly cooked food).

Overall, I was relatively pleased with Bobby's Burger Palace.  The burger meat reminded me of Fat Burger, which is fine.  The bun (out of the bag sesame and sort of flat) needs to be improved.  I have a hard time believing Chef Flay put his stamp of approval on this style of bun. In a prize fight, the stiff competition from across the strip, Gordon Ramsay's burGR bun would easily kick butt on Bobby's flyweight bun.

The fries reminded me of In-N-Out, but were more seasoned and less crispy.  The price is reasonable (for Vegas) and the location on the Strip is user-friendly (and within easy walking distance from Aria & Mandarin Oriental).
 
Mildly related was a towering celebrity sighting outside of BBP on the strip of Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond Fame, who gave us a quick nod as we locked eyes and he ambled off with stilted legs to his comedy club gig at MGM Grand.

Epilogue - Alexandra Niakani (PR for BBP) reached out to me via Yelp.  I promptly send her an email response with my contact information to discuss my experience at BBP (which she acknowledged).  7 days later, there's no response from anyone associated with BBP Las Vegas.  So, in all fairness, since your claim of taking reviews \"very seriosly\" didn't happen, I dropped a star from my review.

UPDATE REVISIT - December 2015

New Year's Eve we needed a quick bite to eat.  I decided to give Bobby's Burger Palace a second chance.  This time, the service was very good.  The cashier/host, Nathaniel, hooked us up and there was a manager on the floor who was working hard to expedite meals to diners.  It seemed like a completely different operation from the last time I was there (with a prbable shake-up of personnel).  Finally, my burger (The \"L.A.\" topped with avacado relish) was very tasty.  So, with the changes I saw, I'll add back two stars to my original review."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. I had the Vegas, my wife the Palace Classic. Very nicely done. One order of sweet potato fries to round it out. ( one order feeds two). Personally I say go crunchified. Staff was super friendly, even gave us our drinks for free. If you like a good burger it's worth the visit"}
{"text":"Wife, son and I all tried different burgers. Chicago burger very good. Son's crunch burger the best of the three. Bobby's Blue Burger good but salty with bacon and blue cheese.  Great people watching spot. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This burger and fries with all the fixin's is amazing - BUT - you have to sit and order at the bar with Caleb. He's our dude. Ask her m about all this Vegas and chill with him while chowing down one of the best burgers I've had (besides my own smoked burger). Cheers Caleb!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Waited for about 50 minutes just to be told that they're out of veggie burgers... The server had no sense of responsibility and didn't even apologize... Won't recommend this to anyone who expects minimal customer service! Would go for zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great location, great enough space, welcoming decor.... BUT...

Food didn't impress me..
I got bunless for I had given up bread for lent.. I got a Turkey Brunch (Turkey Burger with Fried Egg, Bacon, and American Cheese). Meat wasn't dry, but it wasn't moist.. I like my burgers to where a sauce would be extra flavoring. This burger NEEDED sauce, in my case, ketchup... Bacon had a weird taste to it. The egg wasn't to my liking, then again the waitress/cashier didn't really bother asking how I like my eggs.. I had to ask for lettuce on the side when my food came... Instead of being on my plate already because you order, pay THEN sit..

To also add that waitress messed up my coworker and I's orders..

Overall the place is just \"ok\"... I don't really care for it.."}
{"text":"Glad we tried it out! Had the Greektown burger of the month."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, it's hard to eat at burger places but  this place has a great salad and fries cooked separately. Very crispy amazing fries! The two people I was with loved their burgers. All-around good, quick meal."}
{"text":"This Bobby Flay joint is good for one thing, rapacious pricing! The food is not 
only tasteless and unexceptional, they are charging 25% more at the Las Vegas 
restaurant than they are at all there other locations.  Go play the slots, you 
will have a better return on your money."}
{"text":"The best burger we've had in Vegas yet maybe on of the best anywhere the fries are great and the shakes are awesome"}
{"text":"I had the brunch burger (egg &bacon). The burger was good but nothing really special. The onion rings were out of this world good! I will be back for the rings, they're the one rings to rule them all!"}
{"text":"The establishment was not clean it being 830-9pm with very few people in there the place should have been have decent. There was staff standing around not doing nothing. My burger was tasty after having to send it back for not being cooked right. They didn't have a problem redoing it. I ordered well done and it was runny red inside. my husband ordered his the same way and his was right. The burgers could at least be as big as the bun for $9.50 a burger."}
{"text":"The burger here was fantastic. I will have to now visit the ones on the east coast. I have been missing out. I had the l.a. Burger and it was made to perfection."}
{"text":"This is a cheaper gourmet burger place in Las Vegas.  A burger is roughly $9 and fries is $4.  Quality is good.  Tastes great.  My kids told me that they loved the milkshakes.  Please note that this is not a nice fancy sit-down restaurant.  The setting and service are just one step up from In-n-out or 5-Guys but the food is better.

I particularly like the sweet potato fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"Burgers here are the TRUTH. Get it medium rare, take a bite and look down to see your bare feet with your socks knocked off."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a Bobby Flay burger.  I have to be gluten and dairy free, so I have to judge the quality of the burger based upon the burger alone, not the toppings.  The meat should be delicious.  My burger tasted like a dry overcooked hockey puck.  The burger itself was dry and tasteless, and it was served on a bed of lettuce which was to have a balsamic dressing.  Unfortunately they either forgot the dressing, or put so little on, that it couldn't be detected.  The waitresses did bring dressing upon request, but it should not have been served like this.

I would take a pass on Bobby Flay's burger."}
{"text":"I think a lot of people give this place a lower review because it's not beating you over the head with gimmicks like Gordon Ramsay is across the street, plus people seem to hate Bobby Flay for whatever reason.

Me personally, I like good food and don't give a shit who's cooking it.  The place is clean, the menu is short, and the product is simple in a fantastic way.  It's like people don't understand that this is supposed to feel like a blue plate special/simple lunch counter/diner style. 

The burgers come with a variety of toppings, all of them fantastic (that blue cheese, holy shit) but are presented simply because they want the beef to shine through.  You can tell the quality of the beef in every perfectly-medium bite.  The bun is nothing special, but that's ok because it's essentially treated as a vessel to deliver that amazing beef to your mouth.

It's not gimmicky and it's not flashy but damn is it good.  Take the lines at BRGR, I'll stay here."}
{"text":"Amazing a must try while in Vegas. 
Had the Mexican burger great flavor and juicy. Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!  We had the Dallas and the Bobby Blue and split the half and half fries!  Even at 9 pm on a Thursday the food was amazing and the staff attentive!  The tableside condiments were yummy!"}
{"text":"My wife usually doesn't like burgers (because they are my favorite haha) she said this was the best burger she has ever eaten. We had cheese and bacon fries and they were on point. Someone across from us had sweet potato fries and they looked delicious. Tried all the sauces in the little table organizer and they were delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Fries were tasty but a little cold.  Asked for a medium well burger and got medium(fine by me, girlfriend wanted it overcooked).  Soggy bacon.  Their credit card system is goofy and their ordering process is slow.  Other than that, burger was thick and tasty, and the shake was great.  I'd definitely come back if I was staying in this part of the strip again, but I wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"I'll start this off by saying that my rating for this place is really 3.5 and if we received our burgers cooked correctly it would have been a solid 4. 

This place is super casual and it's a true burger bar. You order as you walk in and the menu is straight forward. Burgers, shakes (regular or spiked), salads and sides. There's also this thing called \"get crunchified\" for FREE and they'll put crispy potato chips on any burger for you. They also offer \"the undecided\" for anyone who can't make up their mind on which sides to try and want to split different ones. I thought these touches were very cool. 

After you order you seat yourself anywhere that's open. 

We ordered a crunchburger that came with American cheese and potato chips on it and a brunch burger with a fried egg, bacon & American cheese. We were also undecided on the sides so we chose onion rings and sweet potato fries. We ordered medium burgers but received well done ones. That always sucks because we really enjoy juicy patties. My egg was also well done and no runny yolk :( Didn't send them back because it was late and we were really hungry and exhausted. To the positives, the burgers were very flavorful as Bobby is known for that and everything was well proportioned. The onion rings were cut quite large and I prefer smaller cuts as its always a pain in the ass to bite into them but the batter was also falling apart before you could get it into your mouth. Sweet potato fries were great, at least the ones on top that were nice and crispy but everything beneath them was mushy as they sat around too long in a narrow container and couldn't breathe. 

I'm a huge fan of Mesa Grill and I know that Bobby has the skills so I hope someone can come in here and make a few tweaks and regroup the kitchen staff. The flavor profiles are great but the execution needs some work."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever!! Everything was so tasty. The service was outstanding shiranda I think thats how you spell her name was such a good server she was very attentive and made sure everything was perfect.   I would recommend this place if you're ever in Vegas. ..some things shouldn't stay in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came here while staying on the strip. The food and service were both good. I like that you order at the counter and the food it brought to you. There is plenty of seating and you view the Las Vegas Strip if you want. The food tasted pretty good and the portions were okay for the price. I would consider coming back when in the area."}
{"text":"Bobby Flay seems to be everywhere these days. Unaffected by his recent tabloid exposure, his empire of restaurants, TV shows, signature sauces and spices, cookbooks, and kitchenware are ubiquitous.

I even dreamt that Bobby came over to barbecue with us the other night (note to self: cut down on late-night Food Network binges). I am a fan of his big bold flavors and southwestern-style food.

We look forward to discovering a life-changing restaurant or meal each time we visit Las Vegas. This trip, we made reservations at Giada's. Our second choice: Bobby's Michelin-starred Mesa Grill @Caesars. The main reason we chose Giada's was convenience, as it's is a short walk from our City Center hotel. Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) was not even on our radar.

But as we walked out of our hotel in the middle of this hot, drought-stricken desert city carved by time, tradition, and the mob -- right there in front of us -- a mirage? NO. Psychosis? NO. Standing tall: a BBP!!! The skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked a bit like Cat Cora chanted...\"hallelujah\".

I got on my OpenTable app and dropped Giada faster than NBC dropped Bill Cosby's fall sitcom, choosing BBP instead (sorry Giada D!). Note to Giada: Since you and Bobby are such good \"friends\", you should be okay with this.

What I knew about BBP is that it was created to serve food that Bobby himself likes to eat when he's done working in his kitchens. Simple burgers, fries and shakes with his signature gourmet touches. Until recently -- the locations were all on the east coast. But now open for your west side Flay-fix, the largest Burger Palace ever -- at City Center in Las Vegas.

Designed more like a hip lounge or bar, the place has brightly colored lime and brown furnishings, sweeping curved counters and walls, ample window seating, long communal tables, whimsical light fixtures, and striking neon signage. Bold design to prepare you for some bold flavors ahead.

I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger. 6 full ounces of 80/20 Certified Angus Beef with perfectly melted blue cheese. Bacon, lettuce and tomato on a soft sesame seed bun. \"Crunchified\" of course - topped with crispy thin potato chips. Took a bite... OMG... the skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked like Cat Cora chanted...\"hallelujah\".

Combined with the transcendental golden-brown Vidalia onion rings that taste as good as they look, and the LIFE-CHANGING cream-a-licious \"mocha caramel\" shake, this was a meal that sang together in beautiful, perfect food harmony. The burgers, rings, and shakes I've been eating my entire life are now totally meaningless. 

I would gladly eat at Bobby's Burger Palace regularly -- but as of now there are no California locations. So I guess its back to the Food Network and Cooking Channel we go....

Protip: If you can't get a regular Flay-fix because you aren't on the east coast (or Vegas), you can take any of the house-made sauces home for $6-$10. BBP Fry Sauce (tangy mayo, roasted red and adobo peppers), Burger Sauce (think steakhouse sauce, thick and rich), Chipotle Ketchup (smoky and fiery) or the Jalapeño Hot Sauce (green chilies for heat).

{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars based on service and french fries. Had lunch a few days ago while on vacay. My hubs and I love Bobby Flay recipes and watch his Back yard BBQ religiously. I expected to love this place....but I totally didnt.

The menu looks great. Wonderful variety, reasonable price point for Vegas Strip dining. You order up front and are given a number. There are no tables, booths or comfortable options for seating. It is all bar stool seating and only counter options. Basically you dine next to everyone else. I wouldn't care if I went to a bar and expected that, but not while having lunch with my husband. Luckily the place was almost empty, but it was a major bummer. 

Forgive me for forgetting the names of the burgers we got, but basically they were super forgetable. Messy, onions way under grilled, cold bun, chunky lettuce that was more rib then greens and thin meat patty. Even adding sauce did not improve the lack of flavor. My husband said his was 'okay', but mine was plain awful.

Onion rings were fine. Nothing interesting to report. The bacon cheese fries were super delicious. Fresh fries, crispy bacon and super melty cheese. A perfect side. The shake we ordered, black and white, was fine.

I would not ever go back. There are many other burger places within walking distance to this place that I would choose 10X over. Sorry Bobby, but we still love you."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I got the Carolina burger and the onion rings and sweet potato fries. I spilt it with my friend because it was so big. Our bartender was so nice and friendly and helpful! I actually liked this place better than Gordon Ramsays burger place. It was a lot quicker, quieter, and cozier. Totally would recommend the pixie shakes!! We split the chocolate one and it was so effing delicious. Well done bobby flay!! Go here!"}
{"text":"I visited Bobby's Burger Palace a while back and ordered the \"Brunch Burger\". It was a decent burger, not mind-blowing, but worth stopping if your walking by and your hungry. The reason I gave Bobby's Burger Palace a fourth star is because of the amazing customer service I experienced. The employees are super friendly and make you feel extremely welcome. If your feeling overwelmed by the hustle and bustle of the strip, this is a good break from it."}
{"text":"It's overrated for sure! Fries and rings were burnt and burger was overcooked. I've been to the one in Maryland. That was way better than here. I love Bobby Flay, but I just cannot do it here. Sorry!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places we have ever been too! The food was amazing!! The shakes also amazing and the homemade whip cream was almost better then the shake  soooo very good. The staff was also wonderful and happy and helpful. Great place to eat!  Very clean too! 
A must when your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We've always wanted to come here. For my boyfriend and I to each get burgers and share fries, which was more than enough for us to share and were absolutely delicious, and one coke and a water, was$29.00. We will be coming back here! The burgers were juicy and delicious and the sweet potatoe and regular fries absolutely yummy!!  The server at the bar was very nice and gave us Cokes in to go cups when we were leaving. Love this place! Great place for couples burger lovers with kids!"}
{"text":"Honestly I wanted to try a good burger and with two celebrity chefs restaurants in the vicinity I decided on Bobby flays brunch burger . I was not disappointed. It is quite possibly the best burger I have ever had at a restaurant . Beef was cooked perfectly medium , pink almost red in middle but not so red that it bloodied  the bun to sogginess  , cheese melted perfectly but not melted to the point that the cheese was all thinned out .  It was tied with an egg and bacon which followed suit with the egg just running enough to add the flavor to the burger like a sauce 
The best addition was what they called crunchified 
Meaning chips on top
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It's no secret that i love burgers [and Bobby Flay] but sadly I didn't love his burger. :( And it's unfortunate because this resto had all the makings to be a great burger joint. Prime location, celebrity chef, decent prices, my hopes were high. 

First off, getting there can be a bit tricky. I'm sure there's an easy way but since when do I ever do anything the easy way? Haha! (Sorry I'm getting off the point). So my advice, don't do what I did which was self park at The Aria. You'll do quite a lot of walking thru the casino to find it and unless you're specifically looking for it, you won't just happen to stumble upon it. 

Lines are long but they move quickly. And in that time you get a chance to go over the menu. The employees manning the cashiers are very efficient and friendly. That's always a plus with a busy location. 

So I picked the burger that jumped out at me. The L.A burger of course. Can you guess why? ;) I get teased quite often for my love of avocados. What can I say, I'm a sucker for all things green. ; ) After the first bite I realized there was nothing I really liked or thought was outstanding about my burger. The funny thing is I was starving when I went. You know how ppl say food tastes better when you're hungry. Not the case here. Disappointing and definitely not what I had expected from Bobby Flay. :/"}
{"text":"As this was our late night supper upon arrival in Las Vegas, we probably put a lot of expectation on our meal, and no one was disappointed. We had four burgers, from well done to rare, and each was done to perfection with all flavorful and juicy. The frozen margarita was just right and refreshing in the 96 degree night heat. Service was friendly and meals were delivered to our people-watching window seats in short order. Also worthy of note are the prices, far less than just about any other place on the strip, especially for what you get: a exceptionally tasty burger approved by Bobby Flay. Great meal!"}
{"text":"Edible...but definitely not what we expected. 

Let me start off by saying this is nothing but a glorified fast food place. You are carted through a line to place your order as if you are in a Burger King. Then to top it off .. told you can add a tip on if you'd like. A TIP FOR WHAT??? 

All parts of our order came out at seperate times. 

Fries first for my husband and daughter..I expected HOT Crispy fries.. instead they were barely warm and definitely soggy.... then my salad which was missing the Feta cheese that should have been on it.
Then my husband's very underdone burger which was ordered for medium well but could be classified as medium if he was lucky. IS THIS NOT A BURGER PLACE???

Last but not least we were able to witness an employee argument between cashier and person who clears table. 
Could have done without that type of DRAMA.

BOBBY FLAY.. IF YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR NAME ON SOMETHING ...YOU YOURSELF SHOULD EXPECT BETTER. VERY UNDERWHELMED AT BEST. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER."}
{"text":"The restaurant is on the strip between Aria and Mandalay Bay. It is a very casual place- upscale from a five guys type of resturant with a modern swirling decor. 

I ordered the LA burger that the cashier recommended and got 1/2 onion rings 1/2 sweet potato fries. I got a number and took a seat.  My drink was brought out immediately. 

The burger was great- a sesame seed bun with a wonderful guacamole on top. The fries were hot and the onion rings just onion rings. 

In a town where eating dinner can cost you a paycheck, my bill was under $20 and worth every bite. 

Definitely on my places to return to when I come back to town."}
{"text":"Don't do it!  The prices are outrageous $40.00 for two burgers, fries, onion rings and a Bud Light. The burger was flavorful, obviously good meat but the bun was soggy, not grilled and falling apart. The toppings were not great, mediocre at best. I ordered the Bobby blue burger with bacon looking for that smoky bacon flavor combined with the salty blue cheese.  I found it lacking. The fries and the onion rings were both over cooked and the water dispenser was not working. I expected more from Bobby. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"New Mexico burger- oh so good. Combination sides- onion rings and sweet potato fries, we're so perfectly done. Love the ambiance and service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 10 times...a must for every trip to Vegas for me. I love trying the burgers of the month and the Brunch Burger is a great option that's always on the menu. Shakes are excellent, as well!"}
{"text":"I love Bobby's other restaurants and I've been dying to go to this place! It did not disappoint! The burgers are awesome and the onion rings are a must! The staff is super nice and very attentive. The service is fast too. It's pretty reasonably priced the only minor negative I would say is the burgers are a little smaller than I'd like. Regardless of that I will be going back to this place again and again! Just might have to get two... LOL"}
{"text":"I got the LA burger. It was amazing and came out in like 2 minutes, no lie. I also got it cooked medium rare and it was empty that night in vegas; so maybe that's why it came out so fast. It was god like. I don't know what's up with that avocado relish; I would call it guacamole without tomato and onion but it was great. The staff was very nice, but the food is where it's at forsure."}
{"text":"First time eating here...Had the 1/2 & 1/2 sides ( fries & onion rings)  you get 2 rings.  The largest onion ring was all skin.. horrible.. The fries were burnt, & dried shriveled up.. Limp fries are the worst.. The topless burger was just OK.  We live here in Vegas and eat here, with 1,000's of choices, I will not be eating here again.. Not worth my money or my time.."}
{"text":"Everything was very salty. So salty you couldn't taste anything else. The burgers, fries, onion rings...all incredibly salty. The only redeeming thing was the shake. I would go back only for the shakes. Lighten up on the salt and maybe we'll try again."}
{"text":"Does not meet the burger baseline. Ordered a classic \"chrunchified\" based on server recommendation. I had half an onion in my burger! This place is definitely into the sauces (which are good) but are only a band-aid on an overbearing re-imitation of a classic American burger.

**The staff deserve a 5!** friendly and attentive. I wish the recipes were better."}
{"text":"Good burger options \"the New Mexico \" is awesome. Also try the milkshake 
Second visit here and not disappointed priced well and good quality"}
{"text":"Menu online doesn't reflect menu at the physical location. I ordered the Brunch Burger with Angus beef cooked medium and it was just OK.  The burger itself was somewhat tasty but I still had to add condiments for better tasting. I did enjoy the burger sauce and the location is in a great area if you're walking up and down the Vegas strip. The setup in the restaurant was done and displayed pretty well very clean environment. Overall, for what it's worth I don't think the price equals up to the actual meal."}
{"text":"Love Bobby and love his burgers! It was so delicious I barely used any of the sauces sitting at the table! The Jalapeño sauce was amazing! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and atmosphere. Plus it is very convenient on the strip and not buried in the back of a mall."}
{"text":"Awesome service, and our food came out pretty quickly. The chili cheese fries are DELISH. I had the 'Philly' burger (it was meh) and my boyfriend had the 'Nacho' burger which he loved!"}
{"text":"Save yourself the time and go to bachi burger.  The sweetpotato fries are very good but the burger was not awesome. The meat of the burger was cooked very well but the bun was not toasted and was reminiscent of a McDonalds bun.  I also did not love the ingredients on top of my burger. I had the L.A."}
{"text":"I am still in a state of shock! First of all let me begin by saying that I am a long time yelp user although I have never contributed to any reviews before. Tonight, I went to Bobby's Burger after reading scores of positive reviews, and the fact that I was starving and my brother who works across the street was waiting for me to pick him up. I also want to add that the the burger and fries that I was having was absolutely fantastic!! 

It all started going down hill as I was finishing around half my blu cheese burger when I needed a refill on my soda, so I got up to get my self refill and by the time that I got back all of my food was taken away by one of the servers!! When I got back to the table another server saw the look of astonishment on my face and asked me what the problem was so I explained and at least he offered to cook me another burger but at that point I was already getting texts that my brother was waiting for me so to wait again for another cooked burger and then to sit down and eat again was not an option!! I even made a complaint to the cashier and he just gave me the \"oh well\" look. Needless to say that I left very upset after paying over $17 for what really was a great burger and not being able to enjoy it, I honestly felt (and told the cashier) that I was being rushed out of the restaurant as I thought maybe they were closing and just wanted to rush me out.

Honestly, like I said before, the burger tasted great but now I'm not sure if I would return to this establishment again and if I do, either I would need to carry my 1/2 eaten burger and fries with me to refill my drink or sit right next to the soda fountain.

I am so upset!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner on the Strip. Tried the Bobby Blue Burger & my husband had the Carolina Burger. Both were very good. Cooked to perfection. Lots of interesting sauces on the table to add to your burger. 

They don't have a kids menu but they we opted for the griddle cheese sandwich which was also good. A tad pricey for its size (almost $8 or $9 for sandwich size bread) - but it's Vegas right? Kids also had 2 milkshakes - the vanilla & chocolate & the dark chocolate. Both were very good - dark chocolate the better of the two if u want ur chocolate fix. Also a bit pricey though at $7 a shake. 

Overall though a good meal even if it was an expensive burger place compared to others."}
{"text":"Excellent burger!
We had the onion rings and cheese and bacon fries as well. The onion rings were great including a garlicky ranch. The cheese fries tasted like the cheese may have been processed... Not great. Drinks were great, nice happy hour, bartender was very personable and knowledgeable.  We almost missed this gem because Bobby Flay's name was no where on the outside of building"}
{"text":"Stopped in just for a frozen margarita. Tried the frozen pear margarita and it was decent and you could definitely taste alcohol in it. We didn't eat here but we did notice some \"B\" grades posted on the wall so I'm not sure if I would eat there next time."}
{"text":"I expected better. Maybe this is a franchise owned by someone just making a quick buck. Got here just after opening at 11am. Gal at the counter was nice. We sat at the long table at the window to watch the interesting Vegas people go by. Unfortunately the closing crew last night did not wipe it up. 40 foot long dirty table. I mentioned it and the young gal working the floor came back in ten minutes and cleaned about 20 feet of it. This made me look at the floor. They didn't sweep last night either. 
  The food was ok. Just ok. My medium burger had no pink. Fries were ok. Wife's salad was ok. 
  Restrooms were dimly lit, smelled, and not stocked well. 
  Try the shake shack in front of NYNY instead of this place. Guy Fieri's place at the LInq was a lot better too."}
{"text":"The burgers were good. The staff were unengaged and unempowered. The plates were old and stained. You are asked to tip the staff before they provide you with a subpar bare minimum of unacceptable service. They messed up our order. With your payment, you are awarded the combination to the bathroom lock. However, you would never consider using it unless it was an emergency. We were shocked that Bobby Flay has his name on this place."}
{"text":"Repeating restaurants in Vegas is a big thing for me. I would only do it if the food is incredible. So far I think Komex and Craftsteak have been my only repeats. And the Buffet at Wynn. 

Not only would I come back to Bobby's Burger Place, I'd want to order the exact same thing.

The burger was awesome, I loved the New Mexico, while Mr R had the Dallas. The meat was flavorful, the burgers were cooked perfectly. I went in with no expectations and was totally impressed."}
{"text":"First time in Las Vegas and this was one of the first places we stopped to eat. I spent $18 for a burger and cheese fries with no drink. The burger was good but the cheese fries seemed like a homemade mess. They tasted as though they simply threw American cheese into the microwave and poured it over the fries. Overall, the ambiance was welcoming, clean, and stylish."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing..like seriously amazing. The fries were just fries, nothing special. We also ordered the pear margaritas that were extremely disappointing. Expected something sweet, something that tasted like pear...it was just tequila and lime juice frozen in a cup."}
{"text":"Service was slow but it's only getting 3 stars because the food just wasn't that great. We ordered the Brunch Burger- the egg was over cooked & the Louisianna Burger, which was good but was super soggy. We also got the bacon-cheese fries which were good but they were kind of cold & the cheese hardened up in a coaugulated mess & was just not enjoyable after that. Bobby! What's going on? You're going to need to step it up!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing! Flavor was right, portions excellent and last but not least, the staff...wonderful! I got the bacon cheese fries and egg/bacon/cheeseburger. It all was very delicious! The staff was all smiles and very helpful from the order taker (Dannie) to the hostess (Dinah) I'll definitely be back. I took away one star because they do not carry ranch or sour cream and was out of plastic ware."}
{"text":"We had the Vegas, the LA and the Philly burgers and they were all fabulous! The burgers were juicy, the presentation was good and the service was exceptional! It was a tourist atmosphere and the restaurant was clean and unique. It was a good experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"BBP is a more fast food style place than other strip gourmet burger stops. Its about 1/2 the price of Burgr or Holsteins, and I would say better than 1/2 the quality. Could it be better-yes. Is it a good value for the price- yes. 

The real standout item here for me was the shake. I got the black and white and just picking up the glass and feeling the weight I could tell it was going to be a truly thick shake- not a thing, soupy glass of nonsense. It is 6.50 for a shake- if Quentin Tarantino saw that he may roll over in his coke binge. But its a REALLY good shake. 

The burgers had very high quality meat. They appear to use that technique where they grind the meat and keep the grains for making the burgers so they are fall apart in your mouth tender. I got the Las Vegas and it was pretty spicy and very flavorful. I will say the bun was a bit of a let down- seemed pretty cheap/and was totally bland. The burger was not served searing hot which I would of preferred- nothing tastes better than 3rd degree burns- but it certainly wasn't cold.

The fries/Onion rings- we got the 1/2 and 1/2- the onion rings were very good. The fries weren't very crispy so I would take off points for that. The fry sauce and chipotle ketchup are both delicious.

Frozen Cactus Pear Margarita- yes please. 

Overall, this place isn't Mesa Grill- you can kill yourself with food for 20 dollars and you get a quality meal for that money. If price is no option and you have time to wait I would say go to Burgr, otherwise BBP is prob the 2nd best cheap strip burger behind, ironically, Strip Burger IMO"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I bit on the spendy side, but hey, it's Vegas. EVERYTHING is on the spendy side. Don't be afraid to spend your money here. The burger was cooked beautifully.  Well seasoned and had excellent flavor! I did the Dallas burger and they put fresh coleslaw on it that was very, very good. The thing I recommend most it have them \"Crunch\" your burger. They put home made potato chips on your burger for free. It adds a great texture to the burger, I really enjoyed it! The onion rings are to die for. Huge, hand dipped, you have to eat them eith a knife and fork."}
{"text":"It's really sad how bad this place was! The staff was so unprofessional! I was there two weeks ago, some staff off the clock where waiting on another staff who was getting off soon. As they  talked in the same table I was in very loud talking about the party they are going too in there uniforms , and they got lots of free food and took with them. Now I dont know if the staff on the clock get free food like some places will give to there members once a day, that's fine but they had lots of free food and not only that they went to tell the cook and the cook was trying to be low key and made there order right away as for us who paid for our food had to wait some time, once we finally got our food it was disappointing the burger meat was so dry ! Like wow the buns kinda burnt. Fries not the best only good thing was the mint shake honestly. It's so sad I compared it to Red Robin because in this fight booby lost. Red Robin's burgers 100 times better! Forget the food though it was so sad to see someone hard work go to waist! I don't know who is running this place the manager but he needs to get his staff on training asap! It's horrible I wouldn't be surprised if this places shuts down within a year! To the manger seriously you need a lot of work done on your employees they are just not trained good! Sorry good luck with that!!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Burger had great flavor.  Loved the various sauces
Cons:  Fries limp and cold.  Service poor

We placed our order at the counter and had a seat.  A fairly long wait to get the food given the place was not busy.  When it comes, it was all messed up (missing food, wrong food).

I ordered a Bobby Blue burger and my wife the burger with egg.  Burgers were great.  However, my side of half and half fries and onion rings consisted of a bunch of fries and 2 little onion rings.  Bobby does not do math I guess because I think it should be called the 90/10 side (90 percent fries).

And even worse the fries were soggy and cold.  Plus, they seem like they had already been re-heated a few times judging by their dark brown color."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in a long time, cooked medium as I ordered and juicy. Great options as well, try the crunchified burger. The onion rings and sweet potatoes are outstanding, all fresh cut. The service was fast and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here, today, before the PAC 12 tournament.  Most of the reviews were good so I had high expectations.  I wasn't disappointed.  Ordering was easy. I had the bacon and blue burger, crunchified and cheesy fries.  The burger was delicious with lots of flavorful bacon.  The fries could have been a little crisper but were tasty and nicely browned.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter was probably having a long day, because there are quite of bit of rude people in the area and you can tell she has to deal with them. But this should be about the food and experience, so lets focus on the food for now.  I enjoyed the different types of burgers based on local regions and went with the Dallas Burger. The meat in the burgers was good, and the dill pickle was a nice touch. The food was decent in my opinion, the steak sauce they put out could have been better.  But overall not the worst burger, but not a wonderful experience.
My friend claims the hotdog made him ill, he did not want to go that  night because of it. That is another story. 

Better than fast food."}
{"text":"Very polite staff, easy to use, step by step menu. The flavors and the execution of the burger was amazing.  The fries and the sauces with the fries were great, A bit on the pricer side, but worth every penny. Would absolutely return for more."}
{"text":"Very casual dinning. Had the brunch burger and it was cooked to perfection. My wife had the quinoa salad she enjoyed it but it was good but over loaded with cranberries. A little less on the cranberries. Over the place is good for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Wow what a good burger. It was fresh and the service was nice. If your not used to the LV crowd then that's prob why it got low ratings. This will be my next stop next time on the strip"}
{"text":"Decent burger option on the strip. In true Bobby Flay style, most burgers have a sauce or two and the table comes with four more to try. Cactus pear margs are also legit and comparably priced to other places nearby, and taste a little stronger.

Service is fairly good- though you walk up and order, they bring food out to you and frequently stop to check if anything else is needed as they pass in and out of kitchen, which was helpful. At one point, while here with a group, an employee provided table service for additional purchases rather than making us wait in line again for add-ons like extra drinks or sides.

Brunch burger and classic crunch burger are both decent, still really want to try the New Mexico but last time I was in the area, I had already eaten. Might not be one of my top Strip picks (simply because I don't think burgers when I'm there), but it'll hit the spot."}
{"text":"I heard this was a place for people who like old fashioned, pure burgers. Done the way they are supposed to be done. I guess that means served with a little black curly hair. 

There were 4 of us and not a single person was thrilled with their meal. It was just a burger. You could get a more flavorful burger at In-N-Out, Five Guys or in your own backyard. You can get a phenomenal burger at Guy Fieri's, Gordon Ramsey's, Burger Bar or local faves like Bachi & Fuku. 
The strawberry shake was good. 

We are locals who enjoy visiting the strip. But we just can't recommend Bobby's Burger Palace."}
{"text":"First meal in Vegas and it was on point! Almost walked right by, and that would have been a mistake. Ordered the Carolina medium - couldn't be better. A friend ordered the veggie burger and said it was the best veggie burger she ever had. Friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"Loved the \"Crunch Burger.\" Really good quality beef, done to a perfect medium like I asked for. Satisfying with the added bonus of potato chips and cheese!  Came with a crunchy pickle on the side.
My husband had a not so good salad. Small with weird ingredients. Had to ask for the chicken that was supposed to be with it.  Did I mention it was small?  This place needs some work in the kitchen but I can recommend the burgers.  The sides look good going by too but we didn't have any."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere and good burger selection to touch everyone's tastebuds.  We got the Vegas and the LA.  Enjoyed both.  If you like milkshakes, the Bourbon Carmel shake was worth it!!"}
{"text":"Finally when I ask for rare, I got rare! This was our first meal in Vegas. Tess has never been to Vegas and has been wanting to see the Bellagio fountain because I got her name from Julia Robert's character in Ocean's Eleven. I have taken Gavin to a lot of places but Tess never was able to go. 

This meal was special to me. Our 1st vacation together. The 3 of us. 

Tess ordered the turkey crunch burger, I got Gavin a grilled cheese sandwich, and I ordered the Bobby Bleu. Of course I had to get a starter: The Undecided (fries and onion rings). 

The order did not take long but I was surprised when I tried the fries and it was cold. The onion rings were great.. even Gavin enjoyed it. The burger patty was super juicy and flavorful, seasoned just right. I LOVE the fact that it was rare. It's also messy to eat so don't order this if you don't want your hands dirty. 

The sauces did not enhance anything to me. The jalapeño one wasn't wasn't spicy so I finished my meal w/o any assistance from the \"special\" sauces. After a long day of driving, it seemed that consuming over 800 calories in a single sitting was the smart thing to do."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. We came in for a burger as it was recommended by the hotel. Place was empty so we thought we would have an amazing burger. Ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger and the bacon was cold :( I mean really cold bacon. They call this sandbagging where you pre cook meat to get it out quicker. Totally unacceptable for a restaurant that has Bobby Flay's name on it. On a bright side the service was great.

There are sooooo many better burger joints in Vegas. Don't eat at this 1 and let my experience hopefully save you from this bad experience."}
{"text":"Pistachio milkshake was great. Meat and burgers were not. I would recommend  to go to smash or fat burger instead"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant. I liked the decor and the restaurant was also clean . I ordered the vegan burger , it was honestly the worst thing I've had in a while . However my boyfriend loved his choice , which was the bacon blue burger. I didn't like my choice but that doesn't make the restaurant a bad place . I might consider coming here again !"}
{"text":"Burger was good, but it was very odd that when I ordered a standard cheeseburger (1st item on the list), it came with just meat and cheese. I asked the lady who brought me the burger if it had lettuce and tomato and pickles and she said she could bring them to me which was really nice. Fries were good. They were just as the picture looks. Kinda like Five Guys, but better if you like this style.

The strawberry shake was good as well."}
{"text":"I thought my New Mexico Burger was just OK.  Not the best burger I've ever had. The buns are not very good (not even homemade) and my queso wasnt melted.  Fries are good! Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant with great food but slow service. I asked to have a veggie patty added to my salad which turned into a bit of an ordeal. The woman at the register had to ask the manager and then kept repeating to me that \"they don't usually do that,\" and kept making it seem like I was out of line for asking, even though I repeatedly told her I would pay the difference. Frustrating but after riding the struggle bus we figured it out! 

On the plus side, the food came out quickly and it was delicious!! Big portion and the veggie patty was thick, flavorful, and on point! (If you're vegan be sure to ask for no cheese). 

The restaurant is laid back with a bar and large tables so you can bring in a big group or share a table with strangers. Kind of fun! Not a great spot for an intimate moment but lots of options and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great prices for Vegas, delicious burgers and fries and the best onion rings I've ever had.  Shakes are disappointingly small, so although good it wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Burgers were good,  but the fries were cold and not good at all food was a bit over priced. The khalua vodka shake was bomb! Love bobby but this dont seem like his best.."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers places in Vegas. I had their burger of the month, the buffalo burger. It was outstanding. The blue cheese on it is fantastic! Also very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"If my meal here was a person, then that means they looked straight into Sodom and Gomorra and turned into a pillar of salt... 

Let me start off by saying I loved the atmosphere and the convenient location of the soda fountain. The interior is very retro-mod, and very stylish! Each table has an extensive array of unique sauces to compliment your meal.

I had the \"Bobby Bleu\" ($9.50) which is a bleu cheese burger with bacon (I only got it because it was the only option on the menu with bacon beside the one with egg in it :::yuck!:::) It was delicious! I loved it, aside from the part I felt like I just deep-throated a salt-shaker. I also had the crunchburger option, which was to add chips, and I really enjoyed that along with the flavor of the meat itself.

The beer battered onion rings were not the business... I seriously saw LUMPS of salt adhered to each piece. I only had one piece and couldn't finish the rest. These were $4 for about 5 pieces...

The service was great, but I don't think I would be back to Bobby's Burger Palace unless someone's treating me! Haha. I ended up spending a little under $20 on a burger, fries and a small fountain drink... I pay about $11 in Los Angeles for the equivalent at Hook Burger, sans the potato chips."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Ordered their Bacon Crunch Burger. It was OK. Didn't really have a WOW experience, more like a \"is that it?\" moment. 

The burger comes with only cheese and bacon with so little potato chips inside. The buns wasnt hot nor toasted, which I like. For $10 I could get a better burger from Shake Shack down a few blocks or Fat Burger across the street. So I would say this one is more like a tourist trap joint."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and delicious burgers. I had a special request for my burger and the restaurant manager was kind enough to find me and discuss my request and make it happen absolutely perfect. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Bobby needs to heed his own criticisms.  The burger had no flavor.  Hint: season the meat!    I know why they have burger sauce on the table.  The service was good and the fries were great!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this place and looking very forward to giving it a good review. Sadly, Bobby's palace turned out to be similar to the ice palace in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for me. It enticed me in with promises of endless delight and then crushed my dreams. At least no one turned to stone, though.

The best thing about this place for me has to be the location. We were hungry after walking the strip and it was easy to get in and out with direct strip access. It was all downhill from there.

We ordered a variety of menu items and found out they couldn't be customized. We asked for additional items on burgers and some to be removed from other burgers and were told they were limited and couldn't add or remove items. Bobby's Palace, Bobby's burger. I realize that a chef crafts a meal to achieve a certain result, but this is a casual burger joint. There isn't even wait staff.If I want a tomato on my burger is that really a huge deal? When I asked the reason for the controlled menu I was given a response that if the burgers were customized by patrons Bobby couldn't be responsible for how people review them on Yelp because it ceases to be his recipe. Well, here you go. Once I pay for the burger doesn't it then becomes mine? If I want a tomato than I feel like that should be acceptable. It's not foie gras or any type of fancy gastronomical creation.  

My second critique would be the price. I get it, it's Vegas and it's the strip. I should expect to spend more than standard prices, but I fed my whole family at the Cheesecake Factory at Caesars Palace for the same price with tip. 

My third downside here may be an upside for some people, but I am not really a fan of the communal seating. It feels like a cafeteria to me and not a restaurant. It's not private and not particularly kid friendly since your kid may be impacting the meal of patrons surrounding you at the tables. It is also hard to talk or have an intimate conversation. 

The most personal disappointment for me here, though, was the salad. It was tiny for the price, the produce was less than fresh, and I did not enjoy the mix of flavors. I had the crunch salad and the bitterness of the radicchio, cucumber, and feta combine with the vinaigrette was overwhelming. The flavors built on each other to amplify that bitterness and the avocado, romaine, and chickpeas were not enough to balance the flavor.   

The only thing I really enjoyed here were the onion rings which were fairly good."}
{"text":"I must first start by saying I am a big fan of Bobby Flay, so it hurts my soul to write this review.  This establishment was filthy!  Food on the floor, spots on the floor, and dirty chairs.  I saw crumbs all over tables,  I witnessed a server rake a few crumbs from the table on to the floor, then she must have realized there were too many so she took the menu and gathered them into her hand.  More crumbs still remained on the table, and at no time did I see a server actually use a towel to wipe down any of the tables.  I saw a patron come in and use a napkin to wipe the table she was sitting at, and I observed a server watch her do it and did not step in to clean.  

If the front of the house is like this for all to see, I cringe at what may be happening in the kitchen.  Three stars because I enjoyed the LA burger that I had and the Margarita was tasty too.  Please, I ask that more attention is taken to cleanliness.  It was not crowded so there was no excuse for the condition of this place.  Although my burger was good, not sure if I would return based on the untidy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Brought it to go, burgers were really good and juicy , my favorite part was the onion rings they were big and still crispy by the time I got back to my hotel. Very tasty 5/5 highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"burgers are pretty damn good!! i got the dallas and my wife got the classic.... the only reason why im giving them 4stars is because my wife and i didnt really like the milk shake that we got which is strawberry, it tasted like a sugar milkshake, and also melted too fast... so if ur not really a strawberry fan or a milkshake fan, try somethingelse... i just didnt think the price was reasonable for it.. oh well, we came here for the burger, which is great, so im still giving them 4 stars!! viva!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food. The South Carolina is the best of the ones i tasted. Omg!!!! The bacon cheese fries actually are worth the extra money."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch bite. The food came out fast and was spot on. I ordered the New Mexico burger and fries. The burger meat was succulent, and the fries had just the right level of thickness and salt. A little touch was added by the sauce selection (the burger sauce and chipotle ketchup were very tasty). The only minus of the whole meal was that the fry sauce lacked taste. Other than that, I'll be heading back"}
{"text":"I would choose this place over McDonald's.  Not a lot of taste on my crunch burger. The meat didn't hold its own.  Sauces were good,  and the burger needed it. My husband loved the onion rings but I thought they were too thick.  Bathroom was completely disgusting with toilet paper and paper towels everywhere.  The automatic faucet was running with nobody around it. It was clear that no employees had looked in the bathroom for hours. Disappointed because we were excited to eat at Bobby ' s and we're let down"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was great. James the bartender delightful. He kept us entertained and made wonderful drinks. We intended to pop in, eat a quick sandwich, and be on our way. We ended up staying for 2 hours. Jumping high five James."}
{"text":"My husband and I did a lot of eating this past Vegas trip. He was being a super trooper, following me around as I window shopped from one end of the strip to the next. I thought a little reward was in order so we found Bobby's and were happy! He loves burgers and we like Bobby Flay so why not. 

Procedure: Walk in, order and pay at the counter. Take your number and find a seat. You can build your own or choose from a list. You can also pick the way you want the your patty cooked. 

What we ordered:  
The LA Burg, sub pimento cheese = DEEE-RISH-CIOUS! I remember watching one of Bobby's backyard cooking shows where he made a burger with pimento cheese so I decided to try it. The gentleman taking our order was so nice in helping me make the substitution. Avocado relish wasn't sour- tasted like avocado with a little seasoning. The pickle that comes on the side with the burger was really really good. We easily split it in half.

Bucket of mixed fries = Too much! Granted, we ate White Castle about 3 hours earlier. I can't see myself eating a whole burger plus fries by myself. Russet potatoes for the regular version and sweet potato. They lose their crunchiness if you leave them out. I suggest eating these prior to the burger to guarantee optimal freshness. 

I would like to come again and try another burger. It is a gourmet burger joint and meant for those who don't necessarily want a ginormous Guy Fieri sized messy monstrosity.... Though you can order a huge burger if you'd like..."}
{"text":"One and done

Without a doubt I'm a Bobby Flay fan, so my expectations were high.  Maybe too high.  I was expecting an OMG moment.  It didn't come.  
4 for lunch, $70.  I ordered a green chili cheeseburger and was convinced to add an egg.   My burger arrived with an over cooked egg, so I sent it back.  I counted 6 pieces of green chili, so I ordered more on the side.  After all that extra work, it was ehhh.
On the positive side, everyone was friendly, the gal didn't complain about getting me a burger that I paid for.  Place was clean, bright, airy.  But, none of us would return.  Too many better, cheaper options out there AND more bluntly, I feel like he is banking on his name rather than providing a quality eating experience."}
{"text":"Tons of flavor.  Great selection  but a little salty on the burgers and the fries. Otherwise great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Went late at night. Got the crunch burger, didn't know it didn't come with lettuce, tomato, etc. No one told me, or I'm not very observant. The burger was good, med rare. Had more chips than one probably wants. Also had a pistachio shake(couldn't resist) and that was really good, but very strong flavor....the onion rings were fat, hot, and crunchy. After you order at the front they bring your food to your number/table and that's it. Not really any servers, kinda cafe style. It was good food but I wouldn't come down to the strip and spend $20 on it...not all that worth it."}
{"text":"The Carolina was good! This place cares about a good experience, and the seating is very hip/modern/flashy"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the burger and sweet potatoes fries here.  It was a fantastic burger cooked to perfection and fresh hot food.  While it's an order at the counter restaurant there was excellent service through the entire experience.  It really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Oh man, what a burger! I loved BOBBY'S BURGER PALACE! I went there for a quick lunch while in Vegas and left very pleased!

I ordered the \"Classic Burger, Crunch Style\" which is double American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and the crunch... potato chips!! Dude, those chips sealed the deal. It was one fantastic burg. They also had a bunch of specialty sauces at the table. Bobby's steak sauce, chipotle ketchup, to name a few. I washed down the meal with a Stone IPA.

My wife had the Crunch Salad with Chicken and loved it as well. 

What I also liked is it didn't break the bank. You order at the counter and don't have a server, so it can be seen as a step above fast food. But overall, I was stoked and would go back again.

4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food network and bobby.....but my husband and I were left wanting more in flavor town after our recent trip...fries were good, shake super good, burger eh(unfortunately I've made better, and this is Bobby's \"thing\") if you want a great burger check out bochi burger thanks triple d for the tip! Anyways super clean, service was OK but as far as food nothing I would ever crave(especially a splurge during bikini season; )) . Give it a whirl yourself and form your own opinion but I hope mine helped!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries. Got the blue cheese burger, sweet potato fries, and a strawberry milkshake. Would recommend all. You order at the counter but then they bring you your food. Staff was friendly would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Mouth watering, scrumptious, crunchy (chips added) burger! My friends & I Can NOT rave enough about the burger, jumbo onion rings, fries, & how our first experience went this past week! Bobby Flay can open his palace in The town I live in anytime! Although I had to get water (which was fine) since I don't do beer or tequila, the only thing I would add to menu is a daiquiri of some sort, but definitely well worth a five star rating!"}
{"text":"The New Mexico burger brought meaning back into my life. Bobby Flay will you marry me? Best place ever. Disclaimer: very drunk"}
{"text":"Simple menu and great value for being on the strip. I had the \"the brunch\" with a chicken breast and it was off the chains with a side of onion rings and sweet potato fries. Definitely hit the spot for a burger craving. For two ppl it would prob run$25-30 which is very reasonable. Would eat here again in a heartbeat and try other things"}
{"text":"The place was nice and convenient...located in the heart of the strip. The burgers were delicious however very small for the price you pay. It would have been better if it included the sides like a combo. Also drinks are not included. If your going to make the burgers small at least include the fries and the drink."}
{"text":"Wow... What a disappointment!! I was so looking forward to these Burger. They were over salted.. the sauces sucked. Stick to Mesa grill, Bobby!"}
{"text":"Got the classic burger to make sure I had a fair baseline of comparison 

Juicy - yes
Tender - yes
Savory - yes, although the meat without cheese felt underseasoned
Meaty - yes, good texture

Overall Thoughts

For the price and quality, Bobby's delivers on a solid burger worthy of a repeat visit"}
{"text":"Finally got to have a burger by Bobby Flay! Last day in Vegas we stopped in here for lunch. When you walk in you order at the counter. They give you a number for your order and you place it on the table and they bring your order to you. I got the Palace Classic with no onion and add a fried egg with a side of Undecided (fries and onion rings). My boyfriend got the Bobby Blue with no lettuce or tomato with a side of cheese fries. I LOVED my burger. It was perfectly cooked. The egg was so gooey that I had to eat my burger with a fork! Awesome! My boyfriend liked his burger, however, there was a weird gravy like sauce on it that he did not like. The cheese fries were crazy good."}
{"text":"This place started out with some of the best burgers in Vegas, but in the last couple visits I can really tell they lowered the quality in everything.  Very greasy patties, not fresh vegetables in your burger, very small amounts of cheese, bacon or whatever extra is supposed to come with the burger.  Even in their cleanliness, the place has not been kept tidy.  It is also a shame that they deployed their app and reader to pay and for the 3rd time it is NOT functioning.  Tech could give you a great customer experience or major dissatisfaction which is the case.  After being the place to go for burgers, and being a regular I have to say I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We ordered the New Mexico burger. It tasted okay but was very small  and average."}
{"text":"I loved the burgers I got the crunch burger and wondered how could such a simple burger be so amazing but the beef was well seasoned the chips and cheese were great my husband got the New Mexico and it to was great a bit on the spicy side but I love heat we also got the special pimiento cheese burger I wished we just ordered the grilled pimento cheese instead the cheese was so good that I didn't want the burger that it was sitting on. Now for the bad stuff  the fries were bland the onion rings just OK as were the dipping sauces plus in what world is an order of half and half (fries and rings) made up of two onion rings and a bunch of fries. You pay a buck more for half and half and end up paying 50 a ring they aren't that good. Don't care for the community table set up either but that's just not our style and the bourbon and vanilla shake was awful just not a well balanced shake. So over all I'd get the burgers again but to go and no sides"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow wow wowwww. GO HERE IF YOU LIKE BURGERS. And know that once you go here, other places won't suffice. 

We were here for a log first Vegas trip and came to Bobby's Burger Palace on our last day. That was a good idea because otherwise I would have come here every day. 

I got the blue cheese burger and my friend got he classic hamburger. Both were - no joke - the truest expression of what that burger should be, in every way.  The cheese, the meat, the bun - seriously perfection in burger form. 

We did \"crunchify\" ours too, and that was alright. I opted for a few bites before removing the chips, as I wanted the purest Burger Experience possible. We also got he half and half French and Sweet Potato fries, which was a great way to go (size was just right). I"}
{"text":"It's a good burger, the onion rings and sweet potato fries were good but didn't blow me away.  

The service for an order to go is horrible. Another girl ordered to go too and we both noticed people around us got their orders and were almost done with their orders when I got mine. 

What is the point of ordering to go when it takes as long as ordering a sit down?  Unacceptable!

I am not coming back and the other girl said the same thing.

There are waaay too many choices in Vegas with better service."}
{"text":"First, some qualifying facts:

1. I don't care for burgers
2. I'm a cheapskate

This place greatly exceeded my expectations. I love Bobby's cooking shows, but I know from experience that a famous name doesn't equal quality food. 

You place your order at the counter and then take a seat with a number. The seating is very comfortable and decor is cool and upbeat. I ordered the Carolina with onion rings and a cactus pear frozen margarita. 

Once your order is ready, the servers bring it to you from the deli style cook counter. 

My burger was absolutely incredible. The patty was cooked and seasoned perfectly, the cole slaw provided a great crutch, and the sauce was subtle but added a delicious flavor to it. I swore I tasted a horseradish note  but it wasn't listed so maybe I just imagined it. 

The onion rings were perfectly seasoned as well and had just the right amount of breading. Sometimes it can taste like an onion sandwich, but this added flavor but yielded to the onion. I don't care much for ranch, but it was great. 

During the meal I commented to my wife \"ok, so I like SOME hamburgers\" as this honestly the first good burger I've had in years.

This place was a fantastic given it's location. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, making this feel more like a full service place versus a fast casual. 

Heartily and completely recommended if you appreciate good service, tasty and quality food, and fair pricing."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Had Bobby's Blue Cheese burger + grilled onions with Sweet Potato fries. All super fresh. Burger was cooked perfectly, fries were warm, not hot. The caramel apple shake was a nice finish. $22 total for this good, freshly made burger and location wasn't too bad I guess (best bargain mid-Strip maybe?). Good food Bobby!"}
{"text":"The good:  fries were good.  The sauces/condiments at the table were good, especially the chipotle catsup.

The okay:  burgers were just okay.  Nothing special.  I had a burger the previous day at a random casino cafe and it was much better than the 2 we tried at Bobby's Burger Palace.

The conclusion:  I'm glad I tried it, but don't feel a need to go back."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful.  Best burger and fries I have had in a long time. BUT the service is terrible.  She must really hate her job. No smile no personality at all"}
{"text":"So I'm in Las Vegas with my family.  They wanted burgers so I took the time to leave my hotel where there is a perfectly good Holstein's, downloaded the app, waited in a 15 minute line (only one person servicing the registers at dinner time) and then the scanner doesn't work so can't charge it to the app or receive my $5 credit.  In my line of work, if I don't deliver on a promise, I lose business.  I am writing this commentary from Holstein's back at the Cosmo hotel.  Wondering what thedo to make sure I ever return to a BBP location.

Update- Corporate asked me for my email address to forward to this location on January 3rd and then again on January 5th (not sure why two times).  I replied and I still have not heard back from this location.  I'm sure I will never go back to any Bobby Flay's locations."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  One of the best burgers in this category, I dunno know what it's called \"made to order\" (The Habit, Five Guys, SmashBurger) perhaps?  Fries were great too and it was fun to sit by the window and watch people walk by on the strip. So glad when I found out there is one not too far from me in New Jersey!
A bit on the pricier side, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"The blue cheese burger was done just to order and high quality meat and the blue cheese added a lot of flavor. The bacon was truly crisp. The cashier was very friendly and offered to cut the burger in half so we could easily share. There were a variety of sauces and the chipotle ketchup had a mild kick that was perfect. The fries were generous and skin on salted super crispy. Perfect."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. I had the Carolina while wife had the burger of the month. Lola provided great service. The \"can't decide\" side is plenty."}
{"text":"I genuinely enjoy BBP. I have been 6 or 7 times now, and have had a great experience each time....more than I can say for almost any other restaurant directly on the strip. 

Service is always very good - very friendly and helpful staff. Food is brought out promptly and well prepared. 

My most recent visit was no different. Two circa 5th grade friends were in town for a girls weekend (aka BAEcay because we crack ourselves up...) and staying on the strip. 

We had a round of their prickly pear margaritas....because hot pink!  The server said not to let the color fool us, because they weren't sissy drinks...he was correct. I love the color, and they don't skimp on the tequila. I usually order one each time I go. They don't necessarily taste much different than a traditional frozen margarita, but I am a sucker for prickly pear flavored anything. 

Our burgers were great, I believe everyone in the group was pleased...I was too busy people watching and inhaling my burger to notice if they weren't. I like the burger with the chiles and white American cheese, and I crunchify it, I can't remember we what it's called but unless the burger of the month can't be resisted, that's my standard order. The fries are always great too- started out ordering them to share but have since learned my lesson on that...get your own fries! 

Best burger in Las Vegas? Nah...best celebrity chef burger on the strip? I feel comfortable saying yes. 

And locals - they have a loyalty card!"}
{"text":"If I can rate this place a Zero I totally would my friend ordered a burger and really love burgers and I'm usually biased towards burgers because I love them that much but this place served the DRYEST BURGER IVE TRIED IN MY LIFE ! Never again will we try this burger joint in my life neither should you guys so let me repeat do not waste your time here guys"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here after passing by it on the street. I got the veggie quinoa burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger had a clean, healthy taste. The sweet potato fries were delicious. They were just the right size, appropriately crispy with an adequate amount of salt. The meal was very filling, and I wound actually say the burger alone was enough to satisfy my hunger. My only complaint was that the veggie burger patty was a bit flimsy and broke apart during consumption. I would be happy to eat here again. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I didn't have as high expectations from this quick casual sub $20 per person restaurant.  So I was surprised to get a great tasting well cooked burger. The sides were great on their own but what took this place over the top for me was the sauces on the table.  Bobby's burger sauce is amazing. The green pepper sauce adds a little heat to a burger or a twist in your ranch for your onion rings. The chipotle ketchup is amazing. After experimenting with flavors we found that the best companion to onion rings is ranch with burger sauce (seriously Bobby try it!)"}
{"text":"I had the bacon crunchburger --it sucked. I thought the chips were just going to be added on top for an extra crunch but it was stuck into the cheese, compromising both textures. I ordered my burger medium and it was WELL DONE. So the chewy cheese plus dry burger = an unsatisfied customer. 

I had a mix of the onion rings and the fries, it was meh. I also had a shake. It tasted like a shake... It's just not worth the money in the end. I had a better experience eating a burger poolside at the Vdarra... you just expect more from a 'brand name' burger. You could've at least been better than In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Burger tasted burned and server told us that we had to make the order to go (the server said it was because they closed in 15-20 minutes and they were cleaning). They should have a new sign with working hours depicting to-go orders after a certain time."}
{"text":"Very satisfying! Burger was tasty and juicy! Loved it! The worker Enzo was very friendly, courteous, and provided recommendations that helped us choose the right burger. Definitely worth coming here"}
{"text":"I have yet to have anything bad here...the onion rings are the best ever!  The burgers unbelievably good!"}
{"text":"My wife was craving for a burger for lunch so I suggested to come here. We ordered the following:

Dallas Burger $9.50

Philly Burger $9.50

The Undecided (onion rings and fries mix) $5

Blueberry-Pomegranate Milkshake $6.50

My burger was pretty good. The coleslaw's acidity helped mellow the sweetness of the BBQ sauce and the richness of the cheese. My wife said her philly burger was good also. The onion rings were probably the crispiest ones i've ever tasted with a nice, thick batter. The fries were good too and not greasy. The milkshake was great! It was rich but refreshing at the same time. I though at first that the milkshake serving was too small for $6.50 but when we finished it, I was stuffed.

Overall, this place is a good \"cheat day\" resto. I think what really makes this place good are Bobby Flay's sauces/condiments and its prices. I really enjoyed the jalepeno sauce and burger sauces as they really add another layer of flavor to your burger. And for value, I think its noteworthy considering Gordon Ramsay's burgers are around the $13-$18 range. Oh ya, you can \"crunchify\" your burger (add potato chips) for FREE! Good job Bobby Flay and crew!"}
{"text":"Delicious food ! A nice place to relax and dip away from the craziness of the Las Vegas strip. Great place to grab a great meal or snack at an affordable price.  Please give this place a try !"}
{"text":"Really liked the hip casual feel of this place. I have his burger cookbook so it is great to see them in person

I had the dallas. Loved it.  Great meat bun and great slaw.   Fries were crunchy and very good.   Like this place a lot will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointment. Was excited to get a good burger and was definitely let down. I got the burger with onion straws, BBQ sauce, and bacon. It was overcooked and lacked flavor. Not what I expected with Bobby Flay's name attached to it. And was also surprised when it was an order yourself, take a number type situation. My daughter seemed to like hers and hers was definitely cooked as ordered, so I gave it 3 stars. Should have gone to Holstein's."}
{"text":"What a sell out!  This isn't a restaurant.  It's nice fast food with lots of salt and the staff sucked.  The guy that took my order acted like that was the last place he wanted to be.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Salty af................................... Cheese Fry's came out cold................,........"}
{"text":"Great looking place we are visiting from California and we always said when we visit vegas we would eat here! Great service, love their pistachio shake but burgers were okay."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try Bobby Flay food. However I was less than thrilled after trying the food here. Bobby Flay is supposed to be this amazing chef and unfortunately this restaurant is lacking some serious flavor but I was starving and ate the fries. The burger I ordered was missing when the food came out and when we checked the receipt it wasn't even in there even though I told her exactly what I wanted on the burger and how I wanted it cooked. The onion rings were literally dripping with oil and my mom had to return them. The customer service is amazing and they refunded us for the onion rings that is why I gave the 3 stars food deserved 1 star."}
{"text":"Damn good burger! Got it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! Job well done bobby!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but they were unmet. I ordered the classic burger - I'm traditional like that - and it was ok. I was really disappointed that my bun looked and tasted like it had been purchased from the supermarket. I expected more. My husband had the Carolina burger which he enjoyed but also said that it was nothing special. For sides we had onion rings and sweet potato fries which were, again, good but nothing I'd have to have again. The only thing that I truly truly enjoyed was the coconut milkshake --- absolutely heavenly (if you like coconut) and I would definitely wait in line for that bad boy!! It was a lovely LV day so there were people sitting outside and the vibe was super casual and laid back. It is a nice little place to stop in for a quick bite when you don't want to put up with the madness inside all the casino/hotels. Would I come back? I might -- only because of that coconut milkshake and the minimal wait time to eat."}
{"text":"Burgers were cooked perfectly and the sweet potato fries were amazing!  We would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"BBP shares a spot in the underground right next to the front entrance to the Mandarin Oriental. A burger and fries will run you around $20 after all is said and done.

The burgers come out stacked tall instead of wide, which lets you have the satisfaction of smooshing it all down into a juicy condensed meat puck. 

You can order any of the burgers \"crunchy\" which means they add potato chips to the top (whoop dee doo). It's more gimmick than anything but hey, who doesn't like potato chips?

I wasn't a huge fan of any of their specialty dipping sauces.

The burger itself is cooked perfectly. You can tell them exactly what type of done-ness you'd like and they get it on the mark. The meat and fries are both perfectly salted too, not too salty nor too drab. Good job guys.

It's a shame this is one of the \"cheaper\" eats in the area but it's worth checking out if you're hankering for a burger."}
{"text":"The prickly pear margarita looks good and it is very strong. We ordered the bacon cheese fries. The fries were good but I was surprised that the cheese was like nacho cheese with little flavor. Next time I will order just the fries."}
{"text":"Not sure what i was expecting, but for Bobby Flay, i was expecting more.  The burger selections were very creative but the burger was on par with 5 Guys.  Don't get me wrong, they are good burgers, but just burgers.  If you want to experience Bobby, go to Mesa Grill-that's Bobby Flay.    

As the other reviewers have stated, service was an issue.  Couldn't get our tea refilled for quite some time with very few people in the restaurant.  It seems as though the slower a place is the worse the service.  If in Vegas with a car, go to In-N- Out Burger instead."}
{"text":"See Tip ... Had the Carolina Burger with Chips stacked on top ... Mixed the fries and onion rings and a Coconut shake ... Expect to pay 40.00 for two but well worth it ... Great atmosphere Great Service Great Food ... Honestly this was the best burger fry onion ring and shake combo I have ever had...Ever... Tried all the sauces with the fries... The consistency and flavor of the Coconut shake was perfect... The meat was cooked perfectly and the overall flavored were amazing ... These should go in all major cities across the USA... I was in food for several years so if you need a franchisee for Denver let me know !!!!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers at reasonable prices. The sauces they serve with the burgers were also very good, different than the usual relishes and ketchups."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go if you're on a budget. 

The interior is super cute and fun, with room for groups big and small. 

Burgers  are pretty big and you can \"crunchify\" them, which means adding potato chips. I forgot to ask for my Brunch Burger (Sunnyside-up-egg, bacon, and American cheese) to be crunchified, but my friends had to smash their burgers to fit it in their mouths because the chips made it so tall. I probably would get it crunchified and just eat the chips instead of paying $4 for fries.

Both the regular and potato fries were super delicious! One of my friends got the regular & onion ring combo and it was plenty. Some yelpers are complaining that there are only 2 onion rings, but they're literally the size of my fist, so I wouldn't want more that 2! 

You can get a shake for $6 or spiked shake for $9. Only thing is that they're pretty small from what I saw, so I didn't get one. 

They also have like 6 different sauces, but NO RANCH! When we asked, they said a lot of people ask for it, so I don't know why they don't just add it in. Of their choices, I like the chipotle ketchup the best. 

Overall, I would definitely come back and probably split a burger and fries with a friend because I almost exploded after attacking one on my own. 

Happy Vegas-ing! :]"}
{"text":"Good quality salad all the way! The lady at the counter said extra veggies are free and extra meat is only $1. In the end, it was filling which is important to me. People who complain about about the high prices should consider that they are dining on the strip. Maybe, go make your money back at the casinos?"}
{"text":"We are Bobby Flay fans so we stopped here for lunch on a Monday on our recent trip to Vegas. Sat at the bar and had excellent service from the bartender! He had recommendations, made sure we had what we needed, and we had some friendly conversation with him.

For drinks, my husband tried a local beer from Tenaya Creek, a brown ale. He enjoyed it, said it was very similar to a Newcastle. I had a cactus pear frozen margarita, which was wonderful and a fun bright pink color! They use a higher end silver tequila (Casamigos) and the drink isn't too overly sweet like many frozen margaritas can be. They have a lime flavor also, the bartender let us try a sample and it was great too, even less sweet.

The menu is made up of several burger styles (different toppings/sauces), then you choose beef, turkey, or chicken. You can also order any of the burgers \"topless\" style, which has the patty and all the toppings on top of a bed of mixed greens. They also have a few salads, some sides, and shakes on the menu. 

We started with an order of onion rings. The order had just 6 rings, but they were BIG rings, about 1.5 inches wide. Served in a tall stack, with a side of garlic & celery infused ranch to dip. The breading was light and flavorful, perfectly crispy. Yum! My husband ordered a secret menu item the bartender recommended, a beef burger \"Bobby's style\" - green chilis, a few other toppings we can't remember, and crispy potato chips on top. The patty is a mix of filet mignon & chuck. He really enjoyed the burger! I decided to try the veggie burger topless style. The patty was made up of mushrooms, chickpeas, & quinoa - it had a unique, almost nutty flavor. The smoked american cheese on top had great flavor also that worked well. The bed of mixed greens was actually full of mixed greens (not just iceberg lettuce like some restaurants serve), which I appreciated. The downside of veggie burgers is that they don't always hold together well after you start eating them, so I liked that I could get this as a salad and eat it all mixed up with a fork. Less messy for me!

Overall had a great experience here. We talked about making a second visit but weren't able to squeeze it in before we left for home. Next time! Thanks for some top quality, delicious food Bobby!"}
{"text":"Bobby Flay has is going on. Great burgers for $10 with a view of the strip. Ice tea is $2.50 and they stop by and offer to refill it for free, which rarely happens in a counter service restaurant."}
{"text":"The burger with the chips was awesome. The jalapeño and chipotle sauces were out of this world :)"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the world, I'm really glad I stopped by. The place is very nice, casual and clean. Loved the service, very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I found this place. The food is extraordinary good. Omg Im at BF restaurant. Giggles
I love to watch him on the food network. The place is extra clean. The burgers are to die for. Had to be the best lemonade I ever had in my life. I have to stop in here more often. Dont expect the staff to wait on you tho. Our waitress was busy visiting her boyfriend in the corner making googly eyes at him. Ahhh young love! Yet over all I proudly present them with five stars."}
{"text":"This place was great! Restaurant quality food without the wait. You go up to a counter and order and they bring the food to you. Burgers are cooked perfectly and fries were great! We were a little worried about the clientele since it's entrance is off the sidewalk on the strip, but we were pleasantly surprised. My husband loved that he could get his burger crunchified (potato chips on the burger). Customer service was great, wait staff was helpful and checked in on you despite not it not being a full service restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Eh. Hyped cuz of the name, not a fan of the food. 
Tried the cherry blossom shake... returned it and got another flavor. I rather eat at Red Robin (for those from California). The burgers are small, the fries and onion rings come out just... swimming in oil. I had to get a napkin to dab all the excess oil off since it was dripping anyway. Will never come back here unless I have to. I'm disappointed... I was a fan of bobby flay. 

I gave one star for the food, the second star is for the friendly crew/service and it does have a nice ambience."}
{"text":"Never thought this is how a hamburger should taste!!! This is now a must destination for us every Vegas visit"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed because I love Bobby Flay. The atmosphere and service are great for being a quick food option on the strip. And the menu options sound so appetizing. I like that there are several different protein options and you can get your burger crunchified. But the execution is lacking. I came with a party of 9 and while most of us were satisfied with our burgers, it was nothing special. The meat was overcooked (despite ordering it medium done) and dry. The price is fine although I would get a double double at in n out over this any day. Sides were better, especially the sweet potato fries and onion rings. Was curious about the milkshakes but didn't get one. The variety of flavors was good. Overall I don't think I'll be coming here again the next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Bobby's is great, have yet to have a bad burger; however, the Vegas is very spicy and should have a warning. The atmosphere is nice, a little strange, but clean. The Fry's are terrific and could just east them. The Brunch burger has become a favorite among the guys I work with. Funny we were all hesitant to eat here thinking of the carton Bobs burgers, but when we found out it referred to Bobby Flay celebrity chef are worries were gone. To me I would rather eat here and be served quicker than waiting in the ridiculous lines that are at shake shack one block away. Bobby's wins the New York Burger challenge for us!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out last month here in Vegas. They defiantly have a very unique variety of burgers. Although i was trying to remain somewhat on my diet but kinda splurge at the same time so I ordered the turkey burger, didn't like it. I felt that it was tasteless. The bun and the toppings were good but the meat its self didn't do anything for me. I've had better turkey burgers. 
What did make me happy though and some what made up for this was the sweet potato fries! Very soft on the inside and crunchy on the out! Perfect! 
They also have a few different sauces! 

The presentation of the burger was nice came out very well put together and looked appealing. 

My bf got an actually beef burger with jalapeños and and cheese and the whole works and it looked absolutely great, he like it very much and had no complaints.


The prices could be a little lower for sure."}
{"text":"A Dallas turkey burger right before the big walk down the aisle?  I recommend it."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint! We tried the Brunch and Dallas. So yummy!! Get it \"Crunchified!\" The bacon cheese fries were good. Onion rings were amazing. We also ordered a chocolate shake and a margarita. They were both delicious; not too sweet. The only downside of this experience was that I was too full to eat more and I left craving more onion rings. Lol!"}
{"text":"There is no hype, all flavor! Ambiance is fun and inviting, and the decor is modern and engaging. 

I guess overall I'd say Family style, seating encourages conversation. 

Next up, Mesa Grill.

{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner with a friend before a show and was thoroughly impressed with the food (bear in mind, i had been drinking all day). I ordered the Philadelphia Burger, cooked rare and it actually came out rare. Having your burger cooked to your liking is 75% of the battle with me. The bread (ugh, i ate carbs) was toasted perfectly, and the cheese and hot peppers/onions added a nice kick. My friend ordered the burger with the potato chips stacked on them and it was great. He also had his cooked the way he wanted it, medium. We split the fries, which came with a \"special sauce\", which was nothing more than a spicier McDonald's special sauce that comes on a big mac, however I ate all of it. The fries were good for what they were, I'm just not a fan of kettle cooked style fries. The ambiance of the place was alright...modern take on fast food. I guess my only complaint was the jackass who delivered the food and his piss poor attitude. All in all, I would definitely come back just for the burger."}
{"text":"Glad I had a chance to stop here for lunch with my teen son. The place was clean, the staff was great and gave good recommendations. The burger was tasty and full of flavor. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My Bobby Bleu burger was cooked perfectly, with the toppings all proportional (just the right amount of everything). Love the handcut fries and delicious sauces!"}
{"text":"The Crunch burgers were good. Its right on the strip, and it was dead on a Tuesday night. We also ordered the Bacon-Cheese Fries that came out with more cheese than it did fries. The customer service was good, and everybody was polite. 2 burgers and fries cost us $34."}
{"text":"Liked it very much. Fantastic onion rings and fries. Yelp is making me write more even though I really have nothing else to say before posting this so this extra sentence is what I wrote."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Fresh and quick!  Was so good and quick service loved that I could take my whole family and we could just be in and out. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"A delightful place! Super delicious burgers! Excellent service. We wanted to return the salad that we were ordered and we immediately got the money back - we will definitely return to this place. Burgers  5 stars !!!
I advise everyone to visit this place!"}
{"text":"I had the Bobby Blue Burger. I was full half way through eating it but it was so good I finished the rest of it. Sweet potato fries were okay but the onion rings were great, and huge!

The only problem was the soda fountain. The water wasn't coming out at first; apparently you have to have the magic touch or something. I tried the ginger ale because I was thinking, \"well, the water doesn't work, so...\" and it came out as soda water. Not the best with the fountain machine.

If I was on the strip again (and let's be honest, I only go down there if family or friends are in town) I would stop in again, if only for the onion rings (Yrrm) and maybe to try a  milkshake. They looked so good!"}
{"text":"Here again :) the food is always great! Get the Crunchburger!  It's a simple but delicious burger! My husband likes the New Mexican everytime. We also think the fries and onion rings are delicious too. Love the variety of dipping sauces and condiments! The staff is friendly and attentive. Service was super fast and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger.  I tried the Napa Valley (meat, goat cheese, a little green and some heavenly honey mustard sauce). My hubby got the Nobby Blue.  Both were amazing and with the $10.  We also tried the sweet potato fries and onion rings.  This place seasons the meat to perfection and then cooks exactly to your specifications.  Highly recommend trying Bobbys if you are in town!"}
{"text":"This place is overated juat because its a celebrity owned business, but honestly you can get a better burger at BLT Burger (the best on the strip) or Gordon Ramsay's Burger. The burgers at BBP are nothing special."}
{"text":"What a great place for a burger when you are not feeling Gordon Ramsay's burgers or huge chains like Shake Shack. The burger is decently priced. I got the seasonal mulberry burger and it came with a giant chunk of melted mozzarella. Delicious! The patty and the buns were equally good. However, it does get a bit greasy, and I noticed a puddle of oil under the bottom bun. 

Didn't order the fries, but they looked good. 

They have a lot of condiments for you to pick from if you want to add more flavors to your burger!"}
{"text":"So, I'm trying to scout out good American places to eat in Vegas for a friend that's visiting from Japan in November this year, and I decided to try out Bobby's Burger Palace. My friend really loves In-N-Out Burger, so I figured she would want to try other good burger places.
I came in here on a Tuesday in April around lunchtime before my flight back home. No line in front, didn't seem like too many customers sitting down.
I went ahead and ordered the  Classic Burger with a strawberry shake to go. They claim they have \"The World's Best Shakes\", so I had to try it out right. I requested my burger to be cooked medium rare, as I like it a bit on the tender side.
Burger came out within 10mins, and I took it back to my hotel at the Excalibur to eat in the dining area upstairs. I took a bite out of the burger and from the first bite I could tell that it didn't really meet my expectations. I guess it really isn't meant to be eaten like a regular fast food burger, but the patty was a bit charred on the outside and it was extremely salt, like it was sitting in salt water.  I didn't want to waste my money, so I did eat the whole thing. 
The shake on the other hand was pretty good. World's best shake? Probably not, but it was pretty good. I think Shake Shack's shake is a slightly better and a little bit cheaper. Why the hell are the shakes so damn expensive here? Probably because they're on the strip. I still think In-N-Out and Shake Shack have better burgers as well..
Well, sorry Bobby, but I won't be coming back by myself unless I get dragged in here by my friend."}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago and enjoyed the food.  I ordered the classic burger along with sweet potato fries.

The burger was pretty good and well stocked.  I had the burger at Gordon Ramsey's Burger place the day before and I have to give a slight edge to Gordon's burger.

The sweet potato fries were pretty good.  I had to send my original order back however because they were cold.  The fries are served with a honey mustard sauce, which was interesting and made for a very tasty experience."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be good, brought my husband here. He got the burger with the egg. He was not impressed.  I got the burger with cheese no chips. Flat taste. All the ketchup has extra stuff in it like the ketchup is trying too hard to be something other than ketchup.  Portions are tiny. My burger looked more like a loose meat sandwich than a burger. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment considering the name on the store front. The reason for the poor review is because of service and taste.
Walked in at 11:25ish and was told food has to be taken to go since they were closing soon which is understandable. I quickly asked Mary Mhay the cashier time they closed and she said 11:30 followed by her manager coming out to tell us that they closed at 11:30. After i received my food i confronted them asking what time they closed and she once again said 11:30 and i pointed out the sign and yelp stating midnight and she decided and give me the excuse that it was weekend only but nowhere does it state that.
The following night i called and asked to speak with a manger and asked what time they closed and was told midnight, I then asked what time they closed yesterday and was told midnight and then i told her that i was told 11:30 the night before and they once again gave me the excuse that it was misunderstand like how do you get a misunderstanding when I asked what time you close and then you look at the sign and continue to tell me 11:30 and use the weekend excuse like that is no misunderstanding as well as having a second person to come out and repeat that you close at 11:30. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from here."}
{"text":"The food was as expected. Full of flavor and unique. We were willing to pay more because it was bobby flay's food, but thought the burger could've been bigger for the price. Big meat, but overall size of burger was pretty small. We ordered med well, but perhaps medium would've made for a juicier burger. Fries were excellent. Crispy, fresh, not overly salty. The sauces unique. We liked the burger sauce. Whatever it is he puts in it, makes a much better companion to the burger than ketchup. MUCH better. Ambience and service great. Its not something Id eat again and again due to price but I can definitely see myself craving it every now and then. Or maybe tonight...lol."}
{"text":"I tried the New Mexico burger and it was so satisfying!
I believe the price is lower than Gordon Ramsay's burger place.
The place was not busy when I came and it is kind of hidden in the back."}
{"text":"I was with a large group of people during one of their busier times and there were a couple of small issues however Enzo the manager was very accommodating super professional and made sure we were happy at the end. If I was the owner of this place I would certainly make an effort to retain Enzo as he is a Class Act."}
{"text":"First time here so here we go...

I ordered the New Mexico crunchified with half sweet potato and onion rings. I also ordered a Bud Light to wash it all down. 

The burger looked great when it arrived. I couldn't wait to dive In. However, the bun bottom was soggy and I couldn't pick it up easily.  Then I noticed the cheese melted over the bun,which further made it an issue. At this point, I would use a fork and knife, but they didn't have that. So after I had a firm grip, I took my first bite. Immediately the heat from the green chiles was noticeable. Very tasty indeed with a kick. It did have pickled onions and I really wasn't feeling that. It actually detracted from the flavor of the green chiles and everything else in the burger. 

With my half and half (sweet potato/onion rings)  I received two onion rings and the rest sweet potato fries.  It came with a honey mustard dipping sauce. The sauce was good for the fries, but not the onion rings. The second issue is no ranch for the rings. I get Bobby wants a sauce with flare, so why not chipotle ranch or jalapeño ranch.  You can't have onion rings without ranch. I even tried the chipotle ketchup, jalapeño sauce and BBQ sauce, but nothing did it for the rings. 

I was 3/4 into the burger and loving it. The last and final issue arose. Because the bottom bun was soggy, the burger just fell apart. So I ate just the patty and called it quits. I left the soggy bun behind because I wasn't going to eat greasy bread. 

All in all, the food is in the same category as Smashburger, Five Guys, Habit, In N Out.   I'm not sure if that's what Bobby intended, but that's reality. So with that, I can say I've been there, done that.  Moving on..."}
{"text":"After being let down by an over priced and under flavored burger at Gordon Ramsay's I felt the need to try again and decided to give Bobby Flays Burger Palace a try.  Located right on the strip at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Bobby's is the perfect place to people watch. The menu is small and the burgers are somewhat basic. All of the burgers have the FREE option of being \"crunchified\" by topping them with crunchy plain bagged potato chips. on the side you can order Ala Cart Fries and Onion Rings. The overall price is about 25% less then the majority of other celebrity burgers on the strip.  The best part....the Burger is actually very good. I ordered the basic classic all American cheese burger with double cheese, bacon and all topped with the potato chips on a Sesame Seed bun. When my burgers were brought to the table the Bacon was missing so I let the server know. Not only did he immediately bring me the bacon for the burger but also extra bacon on the side to make up for the mistake, SCORE !  My burger was cooked just right. Medium well, moist but not pink with a nice crust and flavor that reminded me of burgers my mom would cook me in the cast Iron pan growing up.  On it I had a choice of Ketchup's and Mustard's. The Classic Hines or some that were house made. My favorite was the Jalapeno Mustard which was slightly sweet with a little heat.  I had some very good crispy fresh fries on the side that were perfect for dipping in the mustard. The onion rings were not as good, as they were a little less crunchy and a little more greasy. Next time I would do fries only. Simone had a Carolina Burger that was topped with Honey BBQ Sauce and Green Onion Mustard Slaw. She also had a perfectly cooked burger which she really enjoyed. I thought the slaw was a little overpowering with the flavors of the onion but she loved it. She also had chips on it and borrowed some of my extra bacon to put on it. So overall this is one of the better places for a burger on the strip and its much easier on the wallet then most.  I would definitely recommend Bobby's Burger Palace."}
{"text":"Well if this place was anywhere out her than Vegas they would be closed based on the quality of the food ! It sucked !  Customers other than tourists would never go back !  The milkshake was good ! Not surprised it was not busy !  Bobby you need to come see what they are doing to your name here !"}
{"text":"Very glad I ame here! Other high end burger bars are charging double for similar taste and quality. The burger was cooked PERFECTLY! Juicy, Med-rare (cooked to order), buttery and full of flavor! Great value for a lighter meal that's easier on the wallet. Recommend! I had the Brunch burger and tried the s Dallas burger.  I prefer the Brunch burger because I'm a sucker for egg on my burger but Dallas burger was nice also. Fries look like they are made in house. Natural, crispy and tasty. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place after all the Bobby Flay shows I have watched over the years. I am so disappointed. My first impression walking in is the bartender, she was SO RUDE. I had asked to wash my hands in the bathroom before I placed my order, she says no that it's for customers only. I told her I am about to place my order I just need to wash my hands (it's Vegas and we all know the door handles are dirty), she says you have to buy something to get the bathroom code on your receipt and walks away. I should have just left at that point, but we decided to try it anyway since we came for the food and not alcohol. The woman who took the order was not even the slightest bit nicer, yet for some reason we stayed.
I order an LA burger, medium well, fries and a tea. We sit down to a table to wait for our food and see the tables are all cleared of dishes, but still dirty despite the place being mostly empty. I took a photo of the napkin dispenser because the whole top was so dirty that wiping it off didn't remove the dust/dirt. I expect clean from all establishments let alone one with an iron chef's name on the front. 
We waited a long time for our food especially considering the place had maybe 10 people in it, looked over to see our food sitting under the heat lamp while 5-6 employees just stood next to it chatting with the cooks. About 5 minutes passed before they brought our food over. 
The burger was both boring and had the most salty patty! Some bites were so salty they were barely edible. There is a basket of sauces on the table so I had to add some aioli to make it more flavorful, but chose carefully to pick the least salty. The burger patty was barely cooked at all so the middle was barely warm (I ordered medium well). The fries were ok, the sauce that comes with them was ok too. After all that salt I needed more tea, I looked around and I couldn't find an employee. I looked again and finally saw them all in a huddle at the back of the restaurant chatting away again. I walked over to ask if there were free refills on the tea and the girl says \"oh, yeah, sorry\" and lazily walks to the front of the restaurant to get the pitcher. Seriously!!! We left feeling upset with ourselves for choosing this place. NEVER AGAIN!  

Follow up on the burger: my stomach was upset all night, apparently the barely warm burger meat wasn't cooked to the proper temperature."}
{"text":"I thought this was gonna be underwhelming, eg. BRGR across the street. I was totally blown away and impressed with the $9 burger with chips and american cheese. Simple yet superb!

Flay- 1 
Ramsay- 0

One of the best tasting burgers in Vegas aside from shake shack of course.

Fries and onion rings were average. Burger was splendid."}
{"text":"Was underwhelmed at BBP.  Despite the place being almost empty on a Sunday night, my order took quite a long time.  Classic cheeseburger and the undecided (mic if fries and onion rings).  

The burger was a bit on the small size, which isn't all bad.  But there was nothing special about it.  White wonder bread nun with light toast on it.  Burger was cooked properly but not especially flavorful or juicy.  It was on par with a quarter pounder.  The onion rings were cold, over fried, and greasy...not good at all.  Fries were Luke warm...any nothing special. Little crunch, very bland.

Given Bobby Flays reputation i had much higher expectations.  Do not recommend it give all the other chouces in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered on-line to go because my hotel is only steps away and I didn't want to sit in a restaurant by myself, so walked over to get my burger to bring back to the room.  Really good burger, cooked the way I ordered it.  I went with the Philly and the jalapenos had the right amount of kick for me.  I will return next time I'm staying at this hotel."}
{"text":"I like a nice char and chew to my burger, I found the meat consistency a little mushy. Bobby has been putting better products out on tv as of late, I was expecting better. Time for a revamp Bobby!!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a simple yet fabulous burger, this is the place. Fries and onion rings are as good as any other burger joint. Top off your meal with a great shake!  If Bobby's Burger Palace was in St. Louis this would be my go to when craving a burger."}
{"text":"The service was fine but my issue was the food. My boyfriend used to work there so I was excited when I heard that he's working for Bobby Flay so I went in to try the food there. I was extremely disappointed with it. My burger meat was dry, and it had no flavor. The fries were WAYYYY over priced for what I got. I got literally about 7 flavorless fries. The only good thing I had was the milk shake. I'll never eat here again. I expected way more coming from Bobby. Hell, McDonalds is better than this dump."}
{"text":"I happened to go in here as it would be the closest I would get to a \"Bob's Burgers\". I order the Bobby Blue Burger and here are my takeaways. The meat was great...everything else was average. The meat was juicy and cooked to my delight (Medium). The cheese however wasn't what I anticipated. It was ultimately a super melted cheese that tasted like a sharp white cheddar rather than bleu cheese. It kinda killed the experience for me as I love bleu cheese. For my side I went with the undecided (sweet potato fries and onion rings). The onion rings were great. It had a very peppery batter, but wasn't overpowering. The sweet potato fries were phenomenal. I'm just now coming around to sweet potato fries and I must say that these were the best that I've tried. I give it four stars as I think that the burger wasn't very tasty though it did have potential. I think if I ate here again I'd do a classic to get a better means of comparison to other burgers I've eaten."}
{"text":"Thumbs up from the whole family!  Burgers were tasty and cooked well.  Food came out quickly. My husband and I got burgers and my son got a grilled cheese we shared fries and onion rings.  Everything was delicious. The shakes are good too.  This is an upscale short order type place and the ambiance is very contemporary and comfortable.  We will come back next time we're in Vegas.  I wish there was a BBP in San Diego."}
{"text":"Bobby's burger palace menu was very limited we couldn't add or change more than two items to our order. We had to ask for extra condiments. When we asked for mushrooms they said they did not have any, but they had mushrooms for their veggie burger. If you are going to have burger place you need to allow customers to customize or add things to the food you are paying for because in the end, it what the customers wants. Overall I would they were reluctant to accommodate us."}
{"text":"Of the thousand or so burger places on the strip, this is my new favorite, and I've tried probably 85-90% of them. My burger was awesome. Perfectly cooked, quality ingredients, great toppings, nice selection of sauces at the table, and most importantly, fairly priced. This place is nice, but much less pretentious than most of these burger snob joints that are popping up by the dozen it seems. As much as I love burgers of all kinds, the one thing that some of these places are forgetting is that it's still a hamburger. $10 will get you a great burger at this place that's every bit as good as the $16 burger you'll get at any other burger place with a celebrity chef's name attached to it.

Aside from the burger, the restaurant was obviously very clean (less than a week old, it should be). It's got kind of a neo-seventies feel to it. I like the squiggly shaped bar seating. The entire staff was pleasant, polite, friendly, and helpful. Everything seemed to run smoothly while we were there. You'd never know this place was brand spankin' new. The music was nothing offensive, and played at a decent volume. 

The pistachio milk shake was damn good too. They even give you a huge ass straw to make it nice and easy to drink. 

If I had to criticize something, the fries (both sweet and regular potato) weren't outstanding. There are several different types of fries that I'd prefer to dip in their delicious chipotle ketchup."}
{"text":"Solid burger place . Tried the New Mexico Burger- nice sauces and good heat in toppings I asked for Excellent sweet potato fries. Good 4 star choice for burger in Vegas"}
{"text":"Yum - we stopped in for lunch before my birthday celebration to \"carb up\" and get ready for some cocktails.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere is bright and cheery and the food was great.  I enjoyed the Miami turkey burger with ham, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard - so very good!  We shared an order of french fries and they were average - definitely not the best I have tasted.  Convenient location on the strip and quick, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down. It was like having a cafeteria burger it was mediocre at best. Easy to do better in Vegas for s burger. Also, the onion rings were soggy and the fries were too salty."}
{"text":"I'll rather go to Burger Bar or Gordon Ramsey's Burgr.   I found the burger just not juicy or flavorful..   We ordered a crunchified regular burger and a philadelphia style.   Of course there are many other flavors so I'll have to give it a 2nd go.  

The milkshakes were ok.  

Apparently I tried to follow a tip here on yelp that they took 10% off the bill with M-Life card.    The guy at the cash register didn't know anything about this, but said he'll give me the discount anyways. 

Oh, also, I got a side order of the mixed Onion rings and Fries.  It came with two onion rings total and then the rest were fries.  Is that how it's supposed to be?"}
{"text":"L.A. burger with avocado, watercress, and cheddar cheese on a sesame seed bun was unexpectedly delicious! Good fries and onion rings, with a bunch of different dipping sauces. Very friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"Bobby's Burger Palace, oh my!!

 I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay. I love his shows on food network and he knows how to cook. My favorite is beat bobby Flay where contestants compete to make dishes that will or will not beat Bobby's. 

 This restaurant is located near the veer towers and Mandarin condominiums in Las Vegas. It is outside on a side street without parking. You may park in a parking garage somewhere on the strip and walk here. You can't miss it, the sign has a colorful bright rainbow lettering. 

 The food: there are various burgers on the menu which is what this place is known for. Their burgers are unique in that, they put potato chips inside the burger. They call these burgers crunch burgers. I typically order their original crunch burger which contains: a beef patty, sesame buns, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onions and a layer of potato chips. The cheese is an American cheese; however, you may substitute the cheese for Swiss, cheddar or other types. You can also add in extra bacon, avocado or other types of toppings. I personally wouldnt want to pay extra for these. The burger is standard on the menu and is good on its own. I felt that the burger was on the greasy side. It leaked with oil as I took a couple bites. The last time I came here, the burger was less oily. There are also other salads and other various items, but I have never tried them.

 The price: the burgers are about $8-11. I found them to be moderate in price. The fries are separate and are about $5 depending on what kind you want. You can choose to have cheese on these fries or bacon bits. You may customize it to your liking but will cost quite a bit more. 

 The service: above average. I felt that the servers served the food well and the food came out in about 5-10 minutes. You are also able to see the people cooking your food. 

 The inside: it is unique. The tables are curved like a snake and the lighting is also curved. There are condiments on the tables like salt, pepper and other various sauces. There is another section where there are television sets and a bar station for alcoholic drinks. The lighting in this area is different. It is moderate to noisy during the night and there are no bathrooms available. The wifi is not free here too. Overall, my experience here was good. The burgers are pretty greasy and the fries cost extra. The prices were pretty moderate for me so if you want affordability, this place barely cuts it. Good place to take a significant other on a date? Yes, this place caters to couples. May I take my family here? Yes."}
{"text":"Delicious and filling burgers! Can't go wrong with LA. In addition, the customer service is great."}
{"text":"Since I gave Bobby's MESA a bad review I will give him a better one here. This place was just OK for me (but my wife loved it, hence the 3 stars). I just wasn't impressed with the format of the restaurant. It felt like a food-court at the mall or inside a casino. We ordered and sat down with a number. The waitress had a hard time finding us (or anyone for that matter). Our food came to the table and it was wrong, so we had to wait some more. The burgers were good, but not mind blowing ... as you would expect from a Bobby Flay burger. I do recommend it if you are walking around on the strip and I will visit again, I'm just not a fan. Strike two Bobby."}
{"text":"The burger and sweet potato fries were good and the customer service is great, employees are very helpful and courteous. Gave it 4 stars because I felt it was pretty over priced, they make you purchase everything separately which adds up at the end. Don't bother trying to order ranch Bobby Flay don't play that."}
{"text":"Came here while on a recent vacay in Vegas... Primarily came as I'm a big Bobby Flay fan. Overall enjoyed the food but have to say it wasn't as good as Mesa Grill. This place overall ranked as a nice fast food type of place. Similar to hook burger in LA. However that being said service was excels  and staff were friendly. The food was good but fries and onion rings didn't stand out from any other place I've had them. Ordered the grill cheese for myself which was perfect - crisp bread, gooey cheeses really well made. The wifey had a turkey burger but thought is was over cooked...would recommend if you're hankering for a quick bite but can't really say this one hit it out of the park."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and awesome atmosphere.  So glad to check this place out.  My kids enjoyed the crunch burger so much and I had the veggie burger(best one Inhave ever had).  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Made a reservation on open table, showed up 10 mins early and was told they dont take reservations??? However, they said it was slow so i could order at the front, sit down or go to the bar and be served. Sat at the bar and didnt see a soul for 10 minutes. Truly, not one person on staff gave a crap. We cancelled Mesa grill reservations for the next day as well."}
{"text":"Always a good spot for a burger. I went vegetarian this year and tried the veggie burger option and it was great! One of the best vegetarian burgers ive tried thus far!"}
{"text":"Burgers were enjoyed by our crew, except my husband bit into a stray piece of plastic in his. Lemonade tasted fresh-squeezed. Palace quinoa tasted fresh and innovative, and with the ricotta and almonds in it, it actually filled me up. Dinner for five people came to $84. Reasonable for the food, but pricey given the atmosphere, which is very casual / garish, similar to Chipotle. At Bobby's, you order at the counter, take a number sign to your table, and wait for a waiter to bring your food and drinks out to you."}
{"text":"If you happen to be walking down the Strip around City Center, and want a good burger, fries and shake, and if price is no object, this is a good choice.  If you happen to live about 3 miles from the Strip (as I do) there is no particular reason to go to Bobby's.  You can find an equally good burger, cheaper and closer, without having to search very hard.  And I feel pretty sure that the place you found would serve you a bag of potato chips to put on your burger if you wanted it."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, the staff is very friendly, prompt, and efficient. The food is, underwhelming, for the price. I liked it, it was a good burger. But for the price I expected to be blown away by the best burger ever. And I can honestly say id rather go to In-N-Out if I was down in this area of the strip. Not bad if you decide to pop in, and it's cool that they have fountain drink free refills. But if you go here, despite being namsaked after a celebrity chef, the food is average, with an above average price."}
{"text":"My husband and I were starving after getting off our plane and imagine our surprise that all the restaurants in our hotel were closed for remodeling. Walked just down the street for a min and found this place. It wasn't on my list of places to eat but we were happy to find it! The burgers were great! Good meat! Cooked to our specifications and very tasty! The fries and onion rings were fantastic as well!!! Staff was friendly and helpful...Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, however the man that was taking people's order apparently has been deeply offended by everyone who was ordering. He was unfriendly, very short with his words, and just downright rude. I'm not sure how someone who apparently hates customer service is working in a customer service position. 

I have been here several times before and never had anyone that rude help me before. I seriously hope they take a look at who is helping their customers or they might end up running out of them."}
{"text":"Terrific burgers at a fairly reasonable price.   New Mexico version was particularly tasty.  Sounds like there are plenty of other burger joints on the strip but at heftier prices and perhaps longer waits in smoke filed casinos.
Service was also good, friendly and efficient.  Eating area was funky and nicely designed.  Makes for great pics.
Why settle for mediocre Wendy or McDonald burgers when you can upscale for a couple of bucks and have a great burger.  
Yam fries were nice option also. A bit crispy on a couple of occasions but still quite a nice change from regular fries.
Note to allergy sufferers:  the buns have eggs in them although the first two times they said it was egg free.  We were suspicious as our son had a mild reaction on the first two times that we were there but didn't put two and two together as we were \"assured\" of the egg free status.   On the third occasion, the manager actually caught this and let us know that it had eggs and omitted the bun.  
On another allergy note, our son also has a dairy/ cheese allergy so when his regular burger came out with s bit of cheese contamination, the server quickly dealt with it and replaced the burger."}
{"text":"About three weeks ago, I had two friends in town and we were all DYING to try Bobby's Burger Palace. It was 11:25pm and we were leaving MGM so I said to them- let me call and see what time they are open until. I called and a girl , who was clearly dead inside, said midnight, so I said - great! We are coming now!!! Yay!!!! And she said \"uhhuh\" and hung up.
So we made it through the seas of humans as if it were the running of the Bulls, us being the bulls, and we got there at 11:35. There was no one at the counter for five minutes, and meanwhile two more groups of people came in after us so there are about 12 people just standing and waiting. 
I finally found an employee with her back turned to me, I said \"excuse me\" 3 times until she finally turned around and I pointed to the registers and I said we've been waiting for about seven minutes and there is no one there.
She went and got someone else who finally took our orders.
I was first. I ordered two different burgers because I couldn't decide, I knew I would eat one and take one home. I ordered the Carolina burger with extra cheese (smoked american sounded really unique and delicious to me) and the girl enters in extra smoked cheddar- I asked why she did that and she said because that's what it comes with and that's what you asked for. The menus are everywhere- in giant font! I said no, it co ew with smoked American and she said no it doesn't. I said read the menu, please. She said oh. I think this was dead inside girl.
Anyway, my friends ordered along with the other two groups of people and we all sat down . There were people who had still been eating inside as well.
Everyone was served their food, but me- which, hello- I was first.
Half way through eating, all of a sudden the music was blasting so loudly that we couldn't hear each other speak, and again, Ihad to say \"excuse me\" to that same girl who doesn't like to be bothered, and my friend said- what's with the loud music? It's so rude, and she went and turned it down. 
Again, we were not the only people in there.

The next day, I called and asked for a manager. I told her what happened and she was VERY apologetic. She said that she would like to send me a gift card worth three meals. I said that I appreciate that very much and I get that stuff happens, but it's how management deals with it after, so I thanked her .

THE GIFT CARD NEVER CAME AND ITS BEEN THREE WEEKS.

I do not appreciate being treated like a joke, and I am utterly disgusted."}
{"text":"Burger bei Bobby's sind wirklich schmackhaft und gut gemacht. 

Bei den Getränken zum selber zapfen war bei unserem Besuch die Dosierung von Cola-Sirup nicht o.k. - das wurde nach kurzem Hinweis umgehend behoben.

Nicht ganz optimal ist das Verhältnis von Preis und Leistung, Pommes o.ä. zum Burger gehen separat. 

Ein Kritikpunkt ist deutlicher Geruch nach Frittierfett im Gastraum.

Alles in Allem in Ordnung."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked seasoned well burgers.   These are burgers you will dream about.  My only gripe was the several waiters that came over and asked how the burger was.   If it wasn't good I would have flagged you down.  Instead let me eat my perfect burger in peace.  Btw the cayenne burger needs to go on the menu."}
{"text":"Enzo Melissa thank you for the hospitality food amazing 
Like I said the wife does not eat burgers and she came back and took one home next stop Miami"}
{"text":"While in Vegas Mother's Day weekend we were looking for a place to eat and found this place.  We decided to try it out cause I love watching Bobby Flay.  I wasn't sure if it would be good but I will try someplace new at least twice.  I feel like when a restaurant becomes a chain the quality is not good. Well we were very surprised the food was excellent as well as service.  Even though it was a bit pricey we will definitly be going back.  I had the Mexico burger with onion rings.  They were amazing.  The milkshakes are thick and creamy.  The sauces on the tables were so good.  I especially loved the jalapeno sauce.  Great place Bobby Flay, kudos for making sure everything was fresh and I'm sure as good as if you were there making it.  So if you're in Vegas make to stop by Bobby Flay Burgers"}
{"text":"DEEEELICIOUS!  I had the Dallas Burger, crunchified of course!  We also shared a shake.  Burgers were prepared to order and were fantastic.  Great portions and packed full of goodness.  I wish there was a Bobby's  Burger Palace closer to home."}
{"text":"So he took me to a burger joint for Valentine's Day and you know what? It was pretty damn good! I had the LA burger (loving that guacamole!) and a glass of red wine. Then we had a wonderful conversation with Emma, one of the servers, who was so friendly!  Yep, I think we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I came with high hopes thinking it was going to be one of the best places to have a burger. Specially because I love bobby flay!
I'm sad to inform that the burger (the Dallas) was just ok. Edible, but not delicious. The onion rings... The batter tasted good but the actual onion was too mushy. It grossed me out. I just ate the batter. My friend ordered a salad.... And it was the saddest salad we had ever seen, they even served the butt of the lettuce. It was way too pricey for what we got. 
I'm sorry bobby, but whoever is running the kitchen is not living up to your expectations."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to a really great burger and was extremely disappointed.  Burger was dry with no flavor, the bun and toppings were less than exciting.  I liked the onion ring batter, but onions inside were extremely thin."}
{"text":"I went to Bobby's burger last Saturday while I was in vegas. I was super excited to try the burgers I had gotten the brunch burger and my husband had gotten the Dallas. These burgers could of been amazing but they were just way to salty. It was hard to finish the burger. I looked into the kitchen and could see the cook pour 4 heaping handfuls of salt on the hamburgers I immediately figured out why they were so salty. The fries and all the sauces were really yummy, and so was the margarita. They were strong and came in a really cute cup you can keep. If the burgers weren't so salty I would of gave this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, scrumptious, AMAZING!!!!

Maybe I'm just really happy because this place felt like a god send for are wallet while we were in Vegas.

I had the LA burger and my husband had the Bobby blue with a side of fries. Delicious!

The prices were fair which had us smiling because finding food in Vegas with reasonable price is not an easy thing, its either go broke or starve.  

burgers $9.50
sides $4
shakes $6

The menu is simple, descriptive, and easy to order from. The burgers are cooked to order and fast, to your desired doneness, with good portions, and a good variety to choose from. 

The line moves fast and service is friendly and professional.

its casual seating so just find a table. 

this is casual Americana done right, so if you want a really good burger that won't have your wallet singing the blues, COME CHECK IT OUT!"}
{"text":"Came to Bobby Flay's burger joint this time on the west coast yes Vegas baby. I first tried bbp on the east coast about 6-7yrs ago and happy to know at least for me it's the bomb still. We ordered a slew of burgers to try the same as last time for research of course  first up the Dallas which is his Texas burger is still great I think the bbq sauce has changed since last I had it but it still rocks. Now my wife ordered his veggie burger which I hate mushrooms but that burger was good it would be better without all the bread but it was surprisingly good.The brunch burger, the egg runny so good. Now, if you know me, I don't care for French fries at all and should have gotten chips just on G.P cause I am a potato chip person not fries, so I didn't like them then and now but the onion rings are really good. The L.A. burger which I got for my wife she loves guacamole but it needs more guac in her opinion, it wasn't my favorite, I don't care much for guac. The Philly was ok but when I was in Philly I wasn't impressed about the real thing, meaning philly cheese steak, but this version I can hang with this. The New Mexico burger is spicy and delicious . I like everything bobby so I will come back but I hope it's not in 6-7 yrs."}
{"text":"About a year later, stopped in to Bobby's Palace again and it was just as good as the last time.

This time I have the New Mexico burger, with special sauce and green chilies (pictured). 

Everything is good here. Live a little and try something a little different. Don't just get a basic burger with catchup and mustard."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly. It was a meal that I didn't want to end because it was SO good. I would highly recommend Bobby's Burger Palace. I splurged and had the Dallas Burger, sweet potato fries and the black and white shake. I loved them all!!! Everything was done to perfection."}
{"text":"Burgers are juicy and delicious!  The patty was nice charbroiled to perfection.  I'm a bit crazy about pickles and the pickles they made didn't disappoint.  They were crispy and weren't too sour!  Prices are also good!  $10 for a burger made to perfection is a deal!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by for lunch. Burgers are great and they have a burger it the month you can choose from also. You can order any burger crunchy for free and get potato chips added (which I did and it was pretty good).

The fries and manly onion rings were the star (plus the fry sauce... OMG). You can order a 1/2 and 1/2 and can try both. We did that it then ordered another round of onion rings, because onion rings are never amazing. The lunch crowd was in and the line was long, but customer service was great and the expo rushed out rings so we can eat them with our meal.

Will come back and definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Bobby's Burger Palace. We were hoping to have a sit-down dining experience. But ended up eating at the bar where we were totally entertained by the friendly bartender!  I had the blue cheese burger and it was perfect. My friends had the burger of the month and they were equally impressed. Don't forget to try the onion rings. Fresh made and the batter was light and flakey!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is Man from when you walk in you can smell the goodness being created in the back. Everything is so delicious from the first bite into my burger to the bomb onion rings. This has to be the best burger I've ever eaten. I got the Brunchburger and the onion rings and man this place lives up to Bobby Flays name. I would have to give this place a 10 from start to finish. Oh and you have to get the lemonade so good!! Robby gave us a lot of TLC with that delicious lemonade she was so attentive to us. Thank you Bobby for opening this gem on the strip."}
{"text":"Ten bucks or so will feed you. Delicious burger, expert service. Good for a quick meal on the strip, very fast."}
{"text":"Sadly my experience at Bobby's Burger Palace was a poor one. 

We had two burgers. Both were cold and over cooked, dry. I had the blue cheese burger and the flavor was good but temperature was off. 

We also ordered the bacon, cheese fries. Also arrived cold. Bacon was good. Cheese flavorless. 

And lastly the cookies and cream milk shake was delicious (and cold). 

Why not send the food back? First it took a long time for the food to come out the first time. It's Vegas we were hungry and didn't want to spend anymore time at the restaurant then we needed to. 

It was disappointing. Probably won't return. Many other choices to find a high end burger on the Strip and hopefully better then BBP."}
{"text":"Well what can I say about this place this place is amazing I recommend this place to everyone that would love a great burger they have all types of burgers come on in and check them out ! Bobby you out did yourself this time thank you !! Mw and my family will be back !!!!"}
{"text":"We don't know what da faq everyone is complaining about to bring this place's reviews down to a 3.5. This place is awesome. Food is great and service is superb!!! Only negative we had was not liking a sesame seed only bun. They have 20 different shakes, a few bun options wouldn't kill them."}
{"text":"Meat is cooked to order. Every bite was juicy and full of flavor. Friendly staff!! Perfect burger experience."}
{"text":"Bobby, you've done it again. The first time you won my heart was on Iron Chef America back in the day, but this time you've won my heart with your deep quotes on the wall and your juicy buns ;)

Price: About $10 per burger and $5 per order of fries. ADD an extra patty for $4.

Food: 
First of all, I have to note that the patties are thick and juicy which also makes them filling. I ended up sharing the New Mexico adding an extra patty and an order of fries. It was the perfect amount. The New Mexico burger was good, but it did not have any heat to it.. which was disappointing as it was the only burger on the menu that promises heat.
TIP: Don't forget to ask for crunch!
 
Drinks: full bar!

Service: Good. Fast and friendly! Fast food style.
Honestly, this place has pretty dope burgers and a good selection of sauces but what makes this place :( is no spice or hot sauce at all!"}
{"text":"Great burgers here and atmosphere. Staff extremely friendly. Had to pay 9 dollars for parking at the Aria for 2 hours but in the end it was all worth it! My 14 year old boy was in heaven with his bacon cheeseburger with potato chips along with the fries and cookies and cream milkshake!!! We will be back to have more memorable eats as a family in the near future."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum:) We are locals and I can any we definitely will be back!  My husband had the brunch burger and I had the palace cheeseburger.  Now let me say, I have eaten at just about every burger place,including Gordon Ramsey's, Hubert Keller's, and Michael Mina's, on the strip and I have to say, with the additional sauces, this beats them all!!  The jalapeño sauce was just the right amount of heat with the fresh taste of jalapeño coming through and the chipotle ketchup was also great!!  The fry sauce and horseradish sauce for the sweet potato fries were awesome, the onion rings would have been better has they been cut thinner and more crisp.  The burgers were juicy and excellent!!  Definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed my last visit with the burgers being just ok in my opinion. I stated in my last review I would return to give it a second chance sometime in the future. Well the future is here! 

Almost four years later me and my friends stopped in to grab burgers. The burgers or burger I ordered tasted ten times better than the last, somewhat making me eat my words. That tends to happen sometimes haha. 

The Louisiana is the burger I chose. We ordered at the register then grabbed seats at the bar for a round of beers. James was the bartender who took care of us that night. Really cool guy with good knowledge of the beers on tap. He poured me up a Sculpin stating you're not going to find this anywhere on tap at this price. After thinking about it for a few seconds I agreed. I wasn't going to get a Sculpin on tap anywhere under $5, nowhere I knew of at least. Shortly after joking it up with James, the food arrived. 

In contrast to the last burger I had here, this one was juicy and its patty well seasoned. The pepper jack was nicely melted, the slice of tasso ham on top of the patty was crispy and the burger was completely sauced up with both spicy remoulade & red hot sauce adding more flavor to the meats. 

This was a huge improvement in taste and quality. Sadly it was a burger of the month, not one of the permanents on the menu. Sucks because it was delicious. Me joking with James I told him about my experience with the New Mexico burger and stated Bobby Flay should toss that one and put the Louisiana in it's place. Jame's response...\"hey hey, don't you go knocking the New Mexico. What kind of a mad man are you?\" My response...\"ok ok, maybe I'm being too harsh on that state. I'll give them a chance for redemption next time\" haha. Mentioning it again, James was cool and offered some good laughs. You have to have heard it in the tone he used upon saying it which made it hilarious. 

I plan to give the New Mexico another shot just to be sure. However I am looking forward to another burger of the month. Hopefully any burger I order in the future (burger of the month or permanent) will be as enjoyable as this one. 

Dinner 2/11/2018"}
{"text":"Eat Here! Reasonably priced for the strip, about $15 for a burger and a side- I ordered the brunch burger (fried egg, bacon American cheese) cooked to a perfect medium, next up a combination of onion rings and fries because I couldn't make up my mind, both were made from scratch and came with two delicious dipping sauces, to complete my meal a cactus margarita, frozen and perfect to take with me on my walk down the strip. Thank you for curing my hangover and making my tummy very happy-staff very efficient and friendly, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the size of the patty come on bobby your supposed to be an iron chef a least get a smaller bun to fit the burgers I was expecting to say yes this is the best burger but I cannot"}
{"text":"A great location on the Vegas strip and also a very well upkept restaurant. Prices are great and the food quality is even better! The burgers are a good size along with the fries that you have to order on the side but do feed two people! The burgers are really juicy and having the potato chips inside makes it pretty fun to eat as well. Great vibe inside the restaurant because it isn't to loud and blocks out the sounds from the Vegas strip. You really want to try them out because the employees were amazing and nice as well."}
{"text":"Great Burger....nice thick patty and cooked to my liking.
Onion rings were also tasty!
I shall return for sure. Living here in Las Vegas makes that very easy. Lucky me.
One Flay location checked off. 
Fast casual atmosphere. Nothing too fancy, but it does not need to be.
The burgers stand alone!!"}
{"text":"\"That New Mexico Burger is on fire.....and I'm meaning that it's taste is absolutely wonderful!\" Pickled Onion and Jalapeño pair perfection! \"I'm in burger heaven!\" Nice atmosphere, decor, great food, and........great bourbon shakes too! I will definitely be visiting this joint again :-) \"Good job Flay!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Bobby's Burger Palace and even more so when I heard that he makes a vegetarian burger, but unfortunately I think it missed the mark. I would still eat here as vegetarian burgers are hard to come by!"}
{"text":"Blown away!  EVERYONE was incredibly sweet and extremely helpful, especially Enzo.  The food was impeccable.  Margarita was perfect.  The Coke Zero was empty on the fountain, and we told one of the ladies.  She quickly changed the machine, and then delivered us a Coke Zero.  Enzo was attentive during our dining experience and always smiling!  10 Stars service 10 stars food!  Congrats to Bobby Flay and all of his staff!"}
{"text":"The best hamburgers everrrr!!!!!  The condiments were good, milkshake was divine.  We ordered the Vegas, the special of the month in July, a cheeseburger and one more - they were all soooo good."}
{"text":"We love BBP...
Best meat, best cooking..
The pickles are awesome...
Decoration and service is always good..."}
{"text":"Yummy fries and dipping sauce plus black and white malt! However, the burger could have been better.  Definitely not memorable."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the grilled cheese  Side order of onion rings and sweet potato fries. Friends all had burgers that were juicy and tasty! I'll be back! #throwdown"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas, there is not such a thing as \"too many\" burger joints. So with that said, welcome Bobby Flay, and your addition to the Las Vegas strip. Thank you for bringing a decent priced, good quality burger to my place of residence! 
We have Burger Bar, Strip Burger, KGB's, BURGR, and many more I haven't mentioned. All of them have a good quality burger, and everyone has their favorite. 
I am happy to say the Burger Palace can easily be added to this list! 
Decisions are the hardest on a first visit. We went with the Brunch burger and Philly burger both crunchified. (Added homemade potato chips). A fries, and onion rings, and a pistachio shake. 
The shake was delicious and I will come back for that alone. 
I like my burgers well done, and I like when a place successfully still makes a juicy well done burger. I'd say this needed about 2 minutes less cook to be perfect but it still was good. The sauces on the table were great, but the real winner is the honey mustard horseradish that you have to ask for. 
All the ingredients on the burgers were fresh, and you could tell. The cheese was high quality and melted off the sides of the burger. 
I ate every bite, and was perfectly full. 
Also, they give you a points card, where every dollar spent is a point and at $100, you get a free burger. We spent $40 so within a 3rd visit you will earn that burger. It is free, so definitely worth it. 
Can't wait for a second visit, and this I would choose this place over at least half of the other burger joints in this city. Great food, service, and prices!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews here and here are more facts. The burgers are huge! I came hungry and yet had 1/4 leftover (I ordered the one with blue cheese). The fries servings is more than enough for 2. The onion rings are humongous but not to my liking (I'd prefer straw onions anytime). The half half choice is more than enough for 2 hungry peeps. Service is great. And yes they have fork and knives when u ask. My husband and my order came to about $35 and thank God they have military discount. I love u BF! Parking is weird and we had to valet at Mandarin Oriental. Though the cashier said sometimes there is a spot at nearby CVS. I love that the service gave us a to go cup with fresh iced tea before we left. Love it!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places on the strip, I'd even argue that it is the best the lemonade is very good, the customer service is top notch, and the burgers are out of this world, if you're on the strip looking to get a quick bite definitely consider Bobby's Burger Palace."}
{"text":"Who would have thunk that Bobby's Burger Palace smack dab in the City Center on the Vegas Strip and not attached or associated with a casino would be one of the most affordable places to eat at!  Hat's off to Mr Flay!  Mind you the prices were on average $2.21 more than what the email menu I received from Bobby's news letter was but at $9 per burger that is still cheap in Vegas terms :)

The location is mid sized but makes good use of space with cool cafeteria style bench seating.  There is probably room for around 100 people or so.  The ordering system is cafeteria style as well, ordering at the register and then having your food brought out to you.

The menu is fairly basic other than the 5 or six gourmet burgers offered.  I think there was a grilled cheese on the menu, sweet potato fries, regular fries, onion rings, milk shakes and frozen alcoholic drinks as well.

We sampled the following:

La Burger: about a 1/3 pound super juicy burger served with your choice of cheese and a avocado relish.  The burger was tasty and filling $9.00.

Crunch Burger: a cheese burger served with potato chips inside. My daughter loved this burger saying it was one of the best she has ever had.  You can \"crunchify\" any burger for a small charge.  $8.50

Dallas Burger: a cheese burger served with coleslaw and bbq sauce.  Juicy tender and cooked to perfection this was a good burger $9.00

Onion Rings: super wide cut onion rings in a light batter.  The rings were very juicy when you bit into them but didn't come with any special dipping sauce and could have used more seasoning in the batter $4.00

Sweet Potato Fries: a large portion of tasty fries served with a honey mustard dipping sauce, could have been crispier but they were good $4.00

Dark Chocolate Milk Shake: a thick tasty shake, but not worth $6.50

Overall we really enjoyed this place.  The burgers are not the best on the strip but they are certainly the most affordable gourmet burger on the strip.  Stay away from the over priced shakes and you will leave here with a full belly and some spare cash in your wallet :)"}
{"text":"We were not expecting too much from here, but were looking for a meal based on the price point and the fact that my 15 year old loves watching Bobby Flay on the food network. We were pleasantly surprised! This was one of the best burgers I have ever had... and I have eaten a lot of burgers. The onion rings are a must! The dipping sauce was so flavorsome and the flavors and quality of the food was good. Expect to pay around $10 for a burger and $4.50 for the onion rings."}
{"text":"We ordered the brunch burger and the New Mexico burger as well as a half and half of regular + sweet potato fries.

The burgers themselves were decent...which is pretty much an epic fail for a place that has a celebrity chef's name attached to it and is supposed to offer a \"premium\" experience.   The fries were actually STALE and pretty awful.

Even though I can see the burgers being cooked fresh the ones we got actually tasted kind of old (like they have been sitting for awhile)."}
{"text":"Some of the best beef I've ever had. No bullshit. Had the Carolina and New Mexico, both were fantastic. The cactus pear margaritas are amazing. The server bragged about the 9 bottles of pure agave in the machine and judging by the flavor and effect, I believe him. Fantastic service. I hate Vegas, and I'd almost go there just to eat here. Love it."}
{"text":"My cousin suggested that I hit one of the burger joints on the strip.  I picked Bobby's even though I have never seen any show with Bobby Flay.  I sat at the bartender and he was very friendly.  I had a desire for a mojito (which was not listed on the menu) but he was able to whip one up.  I went for the classic fries with the onion rings and regular fries.  The burger was very nicely done with a great roll which I topped off with Bobby's steak sauce (which also goes great with the fries).  The onion rings use a batter with a distinct pepper flavor.  There are also a great selection of televisions so you can watch sports while eating.  Definitely worth a visit to avoid the buffets."}
{"text":"I enjoy every single bite I was on a diet for 4 weeks and I was craving a Good !!! Burger so I got to say it was  worth the wait the sauces in the table have a special and interesting taste !
Service was good ."}
{"text":"Brunch burger is out of this world. The bun, cheese, egg and delicious patty really destroy the competition.  Wish I knew to get the burger crunchy first.  Thumbs up on this one for sure."}
{"text":"I greatly enjoyed my Palace Classic cheeseburger at Bobby's Burger Palace the other weekend.

I ordered it without onions and medium, which came out perfectly. Service was attentive at the register and the food came quickly once I had found a place to sit.

I'm a fan of putting my own condiments on my food since I don't like when things are over-sauced, so the condiment carousels on the tables are awesome for me. I was able to put just the amount of ketchup and mustard on the burger that I wanted.

Extra points for the sesame seed bun. I've heard Bobby Flay talk about this on his shows and how the seeds add something extra to the burger, and I definitely agree!

Great taste and great experience. One of the few places it seems where you can get a decently sized meal (i.e. not giant) and for a decent price. Next time I will try some fries on the side."}
{"text":"We needed a break from hotel catering food or pricy foods in the hotel restaurant. I actually really wanted In n Out burger that was only about a half a mile walk; however, I guess it was in the sketchy area and it was too hot to walk. Bobby's Burger Palace was next door to the Aria, and it became more attractive by the minute since it was close and I have never tried it before.

There was a time when I thought Bobby Flay was pretty flay for a white guy. Then, he got on TV way too much and exchanging toothy smiles with Giada and divorced my fave prosecutor Alex Cabot aka Stephanie March. Not flay. Not flay at all.

However, the burger palace was aaight! First off, looking at all the prices of the burger at $9.50, it was very refreshing. They could just put one price on the top that all burgers are $9.50 instead of listing the same price on each burger. It's pricy for burger but it's Bobby Flay right? Plus, around here, it was a bargain. It's probably the only thing under $10!

My business associates were buying lunch though I insisted on buying. Now, the price got even better for me. I was sick of red meat so instead of getting half a burger, I actually tried the turkey burger LA style or California style. I forgot truly but it was that type of style with avocado, tomatoes, etc. It sounded light for a burger; thus, it sounded good to me. My two colleagues got the brunch one and the blue burger.

We ordered upfront and it was awesome that you could order beer if you wanted to. We were eating during work so we couldn't drink but that was great that we had the option. Oh, they also had Fanta ginger ale on the soda machine. Nice!! 

The ambience was slick and modern, with communal table. Though I have never been a fan of communal table, this one was okay as it was pretty spread out and spacious. The tables had a meandering type of design to it with a good flow and not just a big rectangular picnic table type.

The order was done pretty quick and soon we got our burgers. The sides were huge so I would recommend sharing. The two guys I were with couldn't finish theirs and we actually gave one untouched onion ring order to people who sat next to us. Oh, communal eating...

My burger was tasty and juicy and it was quite flay for a white turkey burger. I loved it though the bun actually didn't look so appetizing. It was pale like Bobby and if it had hair, it would have been red. I prefer those golden glistening with butter toasted brioche or potato buns. This sesame topped bun tasted good but looked just okay. My colleague devoured his brunch burger and didn't say much except mhmh. Jerry, my other colleague, was a hard nut to crack and he said he liked this better than In n Out. He went there yesterday without asking me and he said he preferred Bobby's any day. Whoaa I was surprised but they were kind of different burgers. Jerry's burger came raw and blood was dripping all over though he ordered medium well. He wasn't pleased but he just ate it and he still said it was awesome.

The sweet potato fries were really really good as well as the onion rings. The malt looked good as well. I wish I ordered some but that would put me to sleep during workshops in the afternoon.

Not bad, Bobby. I guess I wouldn't ask for a throw down or try to beat Bobby Flay, unless it is with a paddle."}
{"text":"Wow, good as it gets.  See that photo with the chips on the burger, go for it.  What a textural delight with those chips.  Yes that's just something on the burger along with the other condiments. So sit back and let the burger tantalize your pallet and senses.  While in Las Vegas my wife and I decided to do a burger tour.  Bobby's was just on of the stops we made and it was well worth the walk to this restaurant.  After a horrible visit to Guy Fieri's burger joint (see my review there, not good) we almost didn't go to another celebrity restaurant.  Good thing we decided to check out the Burger Palace.  The onion rings...well they were special with a lite coating of flour and rice flour made the crust very light yet the  onions were completely cooked; a perfect combination.  Usually union rings have a very heavy and thick crust and when you bite it the onion slips out of the crust because the onion is not cooked.  Not these onion rings.  The pair of the burger and the rings is one of the best we've had.

The burger, one of my top favorites, is one I would recommend and I will visit again when we are in Las Vegas again.  The milieu was upbeat modern and welcoming with the windows facing the Strip, perfect for people watching and who doesn't like that.  This was a relaxing place to enjoy a great burger, a tall soda and people watching.

{"text":"I got the Brunch burger and pistachio malt- Best. burger. ever."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a gourmet burger. I'm so upset that this place didn't deliver. The burgers were just okay, I don't see the hype. The cheese on our cheese fries tasted like it was canned. I wouldn't recommend this, I've eaten better burgers at Red Robin."}
{"text":"Many months ago, I saw a picture of the Bobby's Bleu Burger online and it looked like perfection. 

When I saw Bobby's Burger Palace on the strip, I BEGGED my man to take me there for lunch (at 10:30 am). Being the darling that he is, he obliged and we each had a Bobby's Bleu with Cheddar instead of bleu cheese, shared a side of half fries and half onion rings - or as we joked, onion donuts, they were HUGE. And they were served with the best aiole. I garnished my burger with the chipotle ketchup. It was AMAZING. Great service too.

We topped it off with two beers and for roughly $35 were satisfied and happy!"}
{"text":"Simple casual burger place, order at the counter and delivery to your table. Nice ambiance, burger was tasty, good size.  Adult milkshakes were on the strong side."}
{"text":"Best burger on the strip, let alone Vegas.   It is actually for reasonably priced for Vegas.  Great sides too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this for quite some time, but a little disappointed overall. I had the New Mexico burger With roasted green chilies but when it came out chilies tasted like diced chiles out of a can and they were cold. I was expecting more of a smoky flavor from a chili that had been roasted in some form.  The party was very underseasoned, but the french fries were good and hot. I will give it another try sometime little disappointed this time not what I expected."}
{"text":"Super yummy! We ate dinner here last night & ate lunch here again today! Amazing burgers, fantastic fries, & the banana Nutella shake was delicious! My husband was in heaven with the dipping sauces! We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Low quality meat. The fries came out cold. The service was poor. Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"Expected more! Women's restrooms were unkept, trash on the floor, employees texting and stepping over the trash SMH, my $9 margarita came after I finished my meal and only because I asked. Burger was cooked perfectly but the sweet potato fries way over salted."}
{"text":"Located right next to our hotel, we stopped inside Bobby's Burger Palace to check out what Bobby Flay's restaurant is all about. We stood in line and ordered:
1) New Mexico Burger $10.25 - my husband ordered this and thought it was decent; he enjoyed the pickle that comes w/ the burger
2) Philly Burger, crunchified $10.25 - this was great; packed with flavor and they layered on the chips super high. I had to remove the chips and just eat them separately since you cannot possibly get your mouth around the burger at all
3) Onion rings $4.75 - this was not good; not sure why my husband even ordered it, but would not recommend. the batter was very dry; lacked flavor.
4) Pistachio milkshake $6.95 - quite delectable; thick and rich 
5) Pineapple coconut rum spiked milkshake $9.95 - yes it's spiked w/ alcohol but very light; just like a pina colada smoothie; you can ask for whip cream on top if you want

Total = $45.66"}
{"text":"So. Delicious.

I got the Brunch Burger and crunchified it as recommended by the gentleman at the register, and I loved it. I was a fan of the green salsa and not a fan of Bobby's burger sauce.

Yes, the location was a bit messy, but not dirty if you know what I mean. People are messy and left trash places, but the staff service was still spot on. They made sure to pay attention to all orders and make the visit feel personal and welcoming.

I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was really solid and probably the best price for a good burger on the strip. my boyfriend kept saying he wanted to go and i kept shrugging it off but on the last day we were limited on time so we decided to go since it was nearby our hotel. I got the chicken 'chip burger' which was simple with american cheese and a few potato chips on it. I wanted turkey but they were out, so i decided if i got the chicken burger i'd do something different with it and i thought it was really good and not something i would typically order. my boyfriend went with the blue cheese beef burger and loved it. he also got a cookies n' cream shake with a shot of rum and it was so good. so good I wasn't even sure if they put the shot in(?) still deciding if that's a good thing or a bad thing lol. all in all, this is a good place on the strip with a diner vibe, great burgers, quality ingredients & inexpensive prices. i'd say it's a win/win if you're looking for a quick bite while wandering."}
{"text":"So here is the sucky think i visit this place everytime i am in town (las vegas) but the last 2 time the experience has gotten a little worst. I really like this place but i think i am going to have to find a new place now. Last night we got into town and the first place we went was here. We ordered and was recognized by the waiter whom is very nice. But we sat down and maybe about 20 mins in we received our sweet potato fries but they were burnt like the last visit the young lady seen this and took it back as the new ones came out began to eat. After about 45 mins my wife notice there were burgers in the window that looked like ours but the server just kept moving them out the way...we told the young lady that recognized us and she noticed we did not have our burger.so she went over to the screen notice the burgers were ours. Had them remake it but after an hour of waiting we left to get pizza...again i love this place but maybe i shouldnt go at night."}
{"text":"Ok so this is Vegas.  So nothing is cheap.  But the burger is out of the world.  Crunch burger with potato chips.   Bottomless diet Cokes.  Lots of seats.  So burger, fries and drink. $16.50.   Can get beef, turkey or chicken breast.  Enjoy people."}
{"text":"Upon walking in you think you're in a pretty trendy burger place, and the prices definitely match.   When the food came out, though, I wasn't all that impressed with the burger. In fact, I ordered the blue cheese burger and the toppings were quite disappointing. It wasn't real blue cheese. There was a tiny crumble of blue cheese and the rest of the gooey stuff was some kind of tasteless white cheese. Mine was also the last to be served, in a party of 6, and I watched it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes before anyone figured out which table to send it to."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Bobby Flay restaurant, and I'm glad we decided to go the casual route as opposed to something more upscale like Mesa Grill. 

We could tell from Yelp pictures that the seating is communal (a severe anxiety for my introverted husband), so we made sure to be here when they opened which worked out tremendously as we had nearly a whole seating area to ourselves. 

You order at the counter and it was by far the cheapest meal we had during our trip. For two giant burgers, a side order of fries/rings, a margarita, and a fountain drink, the total came to a little more than $40.  

A friendly server came by to explain the table sauces and brought our food out about 10 or so minutes later. The sauce I remember most was the chipotle ketchup because it was AMAZING! I would put that on just about anything. 

My husband had the cactus pear margarita which I took a sip of and thought was just okay. The color was beautiful but it had an odd chalky taste. Everything else about the meal however was perfection. 

He ordered the Dallas burger medium while I had the LA burger medium well without tomatoes. The LA burger has a delicious avocado relish, watercress, and cheddar cheese. We both made sure to get our burgers crunchified which is their signature style of simply putting potato chips on top. It adds great texture and kick of salt to each bite. How did I never think to add potato chips to my burgers before? Genius. And the best part is it's free of charge!

The sides here are generous so one will be enough for two to share. We wanted both fries and rings so the indecision was great. They served them with chipotle mayo and garlic ranch dipping sauces that were both divine.

This completely lived up to the celebrity chef hype for me. We splurged on other meals while in town that paled in comparison to the overall dining experience we had here (both in terms of price and food). Awesome place and I will 100% be back again next time Vegas and I cross paths. I really want to try one of those incredible looking shakes too. 

Side note- Be sure to ask the cashier for the code to the bathroom if needed. They are for customers only and the door won't open without keying it in."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is not good compared to the one I've visited in NJ.  The burger isn't cooked to one temp as NJ's location informs you this is how it's cooked is that okay?  
The next is that I ordered the onion rings and sweet potato fries. The fries were awesome and the burger was okay. I also ordered a shake and it kick butt however the onion rings were like onion rings that had been served and were not eaten so they battered then and fried them again. The coating on the rings was so damned thick and layered I'm almost positive that they are recycled but I can't say for certain. 
The place is currently under some type of renovation with yellow tape roping a lot of the dining area off but there was plenty of room and the burger and fries were edible. The onion rings were not even something I'd feed my dog and sadly the burger was overlooked. I had really expected quite a bit more being a Vegas destination. 
I wouldn't steer clear but I would go in with my expectations somewhat managed."}
{"text":"Burgers are great!! Love the juiciness of the burger. The onion rings are a must but I would skip the fries they are like salt covered cardboard. The service was meh. We stood there waiting for someone to clean the tables. I think this place has great potential. The hamburgers were 9.50 each by them self."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my burger. I ordered the New Mexican burger and it was juicy, spicy, and cheesy. The best things a burger can be. The fry sauce was nothing to write home about. The restaurant is in a great location and easy to walk to."}
{"text":"The burger was the right size for me but did not come with any side dishes. At an additional cost, I got a couple of sides, and I preferred the sweet potato fries over the regular fries (just a personal preference). Overall it is as descent experience."}
{"text":"My family of four ate here twice during our five day stay in Las Vegas.  Gosh, the burgers are delicious.  We had a variety on our two visits.  The Dallas, the LA, the Miami, the American, the Carolina, and the Philadelphia.  I can vouch for the Dallas and the Carolina.  Burgers were cooked perfectly, were juicy and the toppings were just the right mix...crunchy, gooey, savory and sweet.  I had mine topless, e.g. served on a bed of greens tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  My teens also loved adding the potato chip \"crunch\" to their burgers.  Oh, and the frozen Mesa margarita is legit.  I never order frozen margaritas as they are usually bland and short on tequila.  However, given the near 100 degree heat, a frozen drink sounded spot on.  And it was.  The tequila was there, the lime was there, just the right amount sweetness was there.  On the second visit, my daughter got a black and white shake.  Decadent.  Fries were good too.  Big serving that we shared among the four of us.  Anyway, BBP was a cool, delicious oasis on a hot Vegas day.  Oh, and the service was exceptional.  From the front counter to the knowledgeable and friendly folks who brought out our orders."}
{"text":"a reasonably-priced celebrity restaurant fast food chain? yes, it's true.

right outside our hotel, and thus conveniently located for a quick lunch, we checked it out before the nuptials. yup, burgers and beer right before getting hitched!

a list of burgers, vaguely inspired by various cities/locations (\"Philly\", \"Dallas\", and so on) is where Flay's power is flexed here. he's not behind the grill, but his dutiful minions labor to achieve his grand vision.

the Philly burger - with hot peppers, provolone, and grilled onions - was excellent. a hefty size and wonderfully juicy. try the sauces on the table. hell, try them all! a sweet jalapeno sauce, a smoky chipotle sauce, the burger sauce, ketchup, and mustard. chipotle was my favorite.

sweet potato fries were a bit overly salted, but still good. wash it down with some beer, of course!

lunch for two was about $30. considering the convenience and the quickness (service was fast, and we could charge to our room at Mandarin) it was worth it."}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise! Bobby's Burger Palace is serving up delicious burgers, on the strip, and not charging crazy high prices! Is this real life?

While they may be going for the \"gourmet\" burger category, it isn't quite like any other gourmet burger spot on the strip. When you walk in, there's a huge menu on the wall and a counter to order at. Unlike a lot of other spots that are full service, at BBP, you just order and they bring it out to you.

There are several options on the menu for burgers. If you're not the burger type though, you can order any burger style but swap out for a different protein. Alongside the certified angus beef, they offer ground turkey and whole chicken breast. The rest of the menu features sides, salads, sandwiches and beverages. Since they're on the strip, they're also serving up beer and spiked milkshakes.

I decided on the Crunchburger, a simple burger with double American cheese and topped with potato chips. I've gotten in the habit of trying just the meat every time I get a burger somewhere and BBP's was great. The meat was tender and seasoned very well. It seems like they are a little heavy on the pepper but I actually enjoyed it like that. I wasn't a huge fan of the bun though as it was a bit dry. Altogether it was a great burger but I'd like to see them use house made chips to top it. I could be wrong but they sure tasted just like plain ole Lays. It also needed a sauce but luckily each table has a few to choose from and their jalapeno hot sauce really set the flavor off.

We also ordered The Half & Half sides with fries and onion rings. The fries are delicious. They actually fry them a bit on the harder side so they are a nice, crispy brown on the outside but still soft inside. I'd like them to be a bit saltier but they are served with a really tasty fry sauce anyway. It's a mayo based sauce with red pepper that is creamy with a very slight bit of kick. I think it would actually be really good on a burger.

One of my favorite parts about BBP was several little signs they have up front indicating how they cook their burgers. I ordered mine medium, my wife ordered hers well done...they cooked them right and exactly how it says on those signs. To me, that's a great thing, it saves a lot of headache, and possible stomach aches. And even though they aren't full service, everyone was very nice and happy to get anything you need or answer any questions. To top it, we walked out of there for under $30. If you're on the strip and craving a burger, give BBP a try!"}
{"text":"it's pretty pricey, but it's Vegas. Got a milkshake for around 6$ and portion seemed really small. The quinoa salad was 10 bucks... Tasted good. The bacon cheese fries were bomb dot com. Overall experience was only okay. The prices and the portions just didn't add up for me."}
{"text":"Seriously loves this place. The food was served super fast and then quality was exceptional!
What stood out the most was the amazing service! Everyone was extremely nice and gracious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great burger! Cute location. Onion rings we huge and delicious. We orders the special burger \"Louisiana style\" it had ham & hot sauce. They ask how you want your burger cooked -rare to well done; I got mine Med well -  it was perfect."}
{"text":"Gourmet fast food burgers.  Thick, well seasoned beef patties, and topics above and beyond what you'll find at your regular burger joint.  But then it's mashed together in a foil wrapper so when you go to eat it you have that familiar fast food experience of the smashed bun and melted cheese all over the paper.  (this is not a good thing...lol)

The onion rings are HUGE and amazingly tasty.  They look the size of a chunky, bangle bracelet.  They, and other sides (fries and such), are a steal at $4 for a plentiful order.  Which almost makes up for the burgers being dang close to $10.  Sheesh.  

Service can be spotty esp if it's late at night...be prepared for a little wait, it's not always as \"fast\" as promised.  But, it's delicious and worth it."}
{"text":"Had the Dallas and Carolina crunchified...bacon cheese fries, onion rings, mocha kahlua shake, vanilla caramel bourbon shake... SERIOUSLY GUYS.... THIS FOOD WAS BOMB! My father is a chef... our family owns several restaurants... and I rarely go anywhere and give it five stars... worth every cent spent... staff was great with suggestions since it was our first time... severs were super friendly and attentive... our burgers were cooked perfectly... I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"We went for burgers and margaritas. It took nearly 45 minutes for the margaritas to be made - after we had received our burgers and sides. My burger, asked for medium was way under. The onion rings were just a sack of oil. The prickly pear margarita was horrendous. We live in the middle of prickly pear country and everyone has a margarita with it... I haven't ever tasted a PP marg without any flavor other than cheap tequila before Bobby's Burger Palace. The thoughts I've listed were pretty resound throughout our group. The only reason BBP gets 2 stars is because my sister in law had a phenomenal milkshake. Otherwise, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Mexican chicken over lettuce super spicy!!  Very yummy but not really worth $10. Grilled cheese is definitely packed with cheese and the regular burger was ok.  You get a great view of the street and a prefect spot to people watch if you sit by the window.  Over-all we will return but will not be frequent dinners.  To far for the price"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best burgers I've had.
Burger, bun, topping equal in every bite, down to the last bite.
I know it sounds silly, but at a lot of burger places when you get down
to the end, it's all bun and no burger to be found.
These are proportioned so you get perfect combo in your last mouthful.

I was going to give a 4.75, but they got rated down to a 4.
I have to admit when we were there, the place looked a little dirty/dingy."}
{"text":"The burgers were pretty good. The meat was cooked exactly as we had asked, medium well, and the avocado relish on the LA burger was great. Only downfall was that we had immediately found a hair in our fries. They had made us a new order after we told them about it."}
{"text":"Best burger on the strip! Don't pay more for less at other burger joints! Just cause it's Vegas doesn't mean you have to over pay."}
{"text":"Our burgers were great and portioned right for a long Vegas night. The service was mediocre. No one said anything about the sauces that sat on the table. We overall enjoyed the food, price and location."}
{"text":"YUMMY BURGERS!

Visited this place on a saturday afternoon and there was a short line, overall not too packed.

Menu is very easy to maneuver, on the wall to your left are all the options. You can also view the menu online and order ahead online.

I ordered the Crunch Burger, Brunch Burger, and Fries. The total was about $26 which is pricey for just burgers and fries BUT the quality was superb.

Although it may be pricey the quality is higher than average and I think it is worth it for the price. Burgers come with half a pickle to munch on. Beef patty is thick and juicy. Definitely good quality beef. Sesame seed buns which I think would be better if toasted, but good.

Crunch burger was very good. I don't like too much veggies in my burger so I love how they had this option which is plain with meat, sauce, and potato chips.

Brunch burger had a fried egg which cooked well. Not super runny. 

Fries were ok, too greasy for my liking. I feel like it depends on the batch as well because ours might have been the last of the batch that's why it might have been more oily and crunchy.

Overall very impressed with the quality of their beef. Juicy and yummy burgers forsure!!!"}
{"text":"Solid, but I like the place a little further down the Strip that rhymes with \"shake shack\" better."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Not only is the service fast the food is also great! Not just cause he's my favorite chef but it just melts in your mouth so good!!! I plan to try everything in the menu! Place is also CLEAN!!! I LIKE CLEA. FOOD PLACES."}
{"text":"Good Americana Burgers, Shakes and Fries and a bit more in Vegas. Great place to get ready for a fun time in Vegas. If you are hungry this place will take care of that. Good Crew. Manager Shane makes sure that you are feed well and treated right."}
{"text":"This my second time for eat here I think is ok. You order and pay after that you go waiting at table. Burger is nice and service is faster but if you go when them busy maybe little bit slow. But that ok."}
{"text":"It's Friday, 12 noon and we are number 5 in line at Bobby's Burger Palace. Two registers for ordering made the wait relatively short. At the time we placed our order the line was out the door with 15 people behind us. Great idea of having separate lines for ordering in dining and take out. It definably reduced the overall wait time.

My choice was the Vegas Beef Burger cooked medium rare. My wife's choice the Classic Beef Burger cooked well done. We also shared an order of Onion Rings. The onion rings have a nice texture and are cooked perfectly. One order is enough for 2 people 
Bobby has the bases covered. You can order your sandwich with beef, turkey or chicken. You receive a number when ordering then choose a location to sit. The food will be delivered to your table.
Wait time was acceptable and the wait staff explained the sauces available on the table. During our meal a server stopped by and asked if everything was OK and if we needed anything else.

Both burgers were cooked just as ordered. The Vegas Burger has cheese, BBQ potato chips and red chilis on the sandwich. The chips add a nice crunch and are a nice twist. The Classic comes with lettuce, tomato, cheese and sliced red onion. Also the burgers are served with a nice crisp pickle.

The restaurants décor is bright and colorful. The seating arrangements are good for groups as well as individuals. The wait staff continues to make the rounds to remove the plates a clean the tables.
Looks like another winner for Bobby Flay and Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I wasn't in the mood for a burger but the Flay name caught my eye and I knew the kids back home would get a kick out of my eating there (they watch America's Worst Cooks all the time) so I went in.

I was surprised at how casual it was and that it was not full service. That's fine, though. I told the nice lady at the register that it was my first and, in all likelihood, only time I would ever visit (I don't get to Vegas often). With that in mind, what should I not miss? She set me up with the Brunch burger, fries and a banana and Nutella malt.

I knew things would go my way when I sat at the table to find a carousel of sauces. I'm a sauce kind of guy. There was ketchup and mustard (nothing special) but also a jalapeño hot sauce which had a nice tang to it, a smokey chipotle ketchup (my favorite of the bunch), and a curiously named \"burger sauce\" which was peppery and sweet like molasses.

The burger arrived stacked high with a perfectly medium and juicy patty, quality bacon, a fried egg whose runny yoke was beginning to fill the bottom of the plate, gobs of American cheese, and potato chips. At first I was disappointed to find that the chips were simple bagged style but as I started into the burger, I changed my mind. Kettle style chips would be too much. These provided just enough crunch and salt to really compliment the egg. The pickle that accompanied the burger was thick, cool and crunchy. A welcome addition.

You guys. This is the best burger I have ever had. Seriously. The only thing that could (and did) make it better was a squirt of chipotle ketchup on every other bite.

The fries were equally impressive. I really got the feeling that some care and culinary science went into the preparation of these. They were flavorful. Crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. With just the right amount of salt.

The shake did not disappoint either, though I felt pretty guilty after crushing the meal and chasing it with such a heavy desert.

I know I said I would probably not be back. But I've got a few more days here. I might make a point to return.

Job freaking well done!"}
{"text":"I liked everything that I tried here on my first visit.

I had the Brunch Burger (served naked--bun-less, on a bed of mixed greens), Sweet Potato Fries (perfect without the accompanying dipping sauce), and the Mesa frozen margarita.

The staff was super friendly, which I did not expect, esp. from a basically fast-food joint. So that was really cool."}
{"text":"Overall, BBP offers extremely tasty food at a reasonable price. The wonderful food, ambiance, and wide variety of burgers leaves me wanting to come back. 

Price - $9.50 for all burger styles and no extra cost for turkey burger or chicken breast and you can get the burger \"crunchified\" for no extra cost. The shakes are pricier at $6.50 and seemed slightly smaller than normal shake sizes. Sweet potato fries are $4, but feed two people. We got 2 burgers, 2 shakes, and 1 fry for $38, plus a small optional tip at the counter and table. 

Food - BBP offers a wide variety of burger options. The two we tried (Carolina and the classic) were amazing. What was most notable was how ideally cooked they were. They allow you to select from rare to well done. The sesame buns held the burgers and toppings together making it very easy to eat without the loss of any toppings. The  shakes were some of the most flavorful we've had. It is apparent that BBP is using the $6.50 to invest in quality ingredients and not skimping on them. Our coconut shake and pistachio malt were achievements in subtlety and over the top flavor, respectively. You could chew the flakes of coconut...mmmm. The sweet potato fries served two people and came with horseradish based dipping sauces. The fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and had flakes of mild salt coating them. 

Ambiance - There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor dining area is large and very modern and funky. There is S-shaped counter-style seating that zig zags across one side of the room. You can see through a wide openings to where they are preparing the good. The vibe is casual, but is fun to look. 

Service - The service was efficient and friendly. The person who took our order at the counter made sure to guide us through our order and offered complementary water cups. The food was brought to us quite quickly. For being informal, fast-service dining, the service was very attentive checking in on us and the food.

It's clear that the sincerity of this place goes far beyond slapping a celebrity chef's name on the shingle."}
{"text":"Walked in and the server came to our table 15 mi it es after we ordered oion rings then said they ran out and didn't have anymore for the night that she even went back there to \" check for herself\" then when she broke us the news she made it seem like it was our fault for walking in late literally saying and I quote \"well we are closed anyways so it's not our fault we ran out\" idk what kind of BS attitude that was but as I was talking with my group about how sure all what she said just happened NATE the manager comes back with onion rings and said sorry should isn't the manager and made onion rings himself with what he checked they still had he apologized for his employee not doing her job and went above and beyond as an employee/manager to better suit the customer and not only go check and make the food himself but give us a gift card to come back and for your services.  If they service the next time is anything even remotely close to what the class of service nate gave to us today best belive we will come back for the service that is up to par with the food they serve."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. Had my husband pick me up a burger with fries/onion rings and a shake. I unwrapped a burger looked more like Carl's Jr. then an upscale burger I was expecting. Within hours I actually got sick from this food. Nothing like having to take care of a baby when you have food poisoning:("}
{"text":"Loved the burgers, just wonderful. I had the Miami, the wife had the LA. 
Loved the staff, very nice and friendly. And lots of staff. 
Loved the different sauces on the table, my favorite was chipotle ketchup. 
French fries were ok
Didn't care for the onion rings, because when I bit into one a lot of juice ran out which I thought was oil but could have been water. Anyway I left it on the plate.  I guess I am not a big fan of onion rings anyway. 
Not really enough french fry sauce to dip in. 
You must remember that it's a burger joint and not fine dinning.  The way it works is you order at a counter, pay, sit down and the staff brings you the hot food.  
Remember to leave a tip for the staff, they are working hard to make you happy."}
{"text":"For sure one of the best hamburgers in Las Vegas. The price is a little high but you for sure get quality and cooked to perfection. Pleaseeeee try the sweet potatoes fries they are amazing. 
The Miami and Vegas hamburgers  are my favorites."}
{"text":"Lunch should always be a burger with potato chips on top! BBP is an order at the counter and sit to eat or ..to go setup and the model works  A giant wall menu greets you as you enter and the staff is warm and helpful. I ordered the Philly burger \"crunchified\" (potato chips on top of the cheese) and it was excellent They ask how you would like your burger cooked which is really class. I went med-rare and I would suggest that to all. The table features several different condiment options including a burger sauce ( kind of steak sauce-ish,) a jalapeno pepper sauce, chipotle ketchup and of course the stock ketchup and mustard. Also ordered fries that were just OK but the sauce served with them that has a roasted peppers note was very tasty. All in all pretty good. It's certainly not fancy, not cheap for a burger (but free drink refills were nice) but if you are on vacation or just throwing away the commitment to excellence for one meal its worth the stop."}
{"text":"We had seen the crunch burger on the menu through the glass the night before and had to come back to try it.  Outstanding!  So good I'll make sure we get back there before our trip ends.

The staff were all incredibly friendly and attentive during our 2:00pm visit and where most places tend to overcook, the team here produced an absolutely perfect medium rare burger.  

If people are looking for a gourmet truffle burger topped foie gras, I can see why they'd be disappointed.  But if you're looking for delicious food presented without attitude by smiling, helpful staff in a comfortable atmosphere (with phenomenal prices for Vegas!) look no further."}
{"text":"2 stars for the lack of vegetarian options on the menu.  In this day and age, I am surprised that there isn't a veggie burger option on the menu.  Real shame since the grilled cheese I had was very good."}
{"text":"I had the LA burger with a side of sweet potato fries and onion rings.
The burger was simple, nothing too memorable. However, the meat was very well seasoned which set the burgers here apart from other burger joints.
The sweet potato fries were nothing special, but the onion rings were well-made.

The store's interior design is very trendy and the service is spectacular.
I'm sure there are better places to get a burger, but Bobby's Burger Palace isn't too bad."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place. Arrived at 11:15 pm with my friends, cashier told us that they were closing in 15 min so only takeout orders were being placed. We check online since we had previously seen midnight and then a huge sign at the entrance said open 11am to midnight we told her and she just hesitated to answer the question and gave us the excuse that it's open till 12 on weekends. BULLSHIT. Went on yelp & saw the hours everyday 11am to midnight. We should of walked away and taken our money somewhere else but since we were there & really wanted to try this place out but never again. Fuck this place! 

Burgers are bland also, not worth the $10. Rather go to fatburger across the st. at least their burgers taste good!"}
{"text":"I will give this place 3 stars because the crunchy chopped salad was very good (minus the bitter red cabbage). It had a lot of different ingredients in it (garbanzo beans, avocado, won ton chips, etc.) and the dressing was yummy. I also liked the overall ambience of the place. Very open, clean and trendy.

However, I ordered a cactus pear margarita.. it was the worst margarita I've ever tasted. Although it was pretty, there was no cactus pear flavor at all. It tasted as if someone had just blended tequila and ice and poured it into a cup. I didn't bring this to their attention because I was just over it by this point. I'm sure they would have done something to fix it but it was just beyond repair."}
{"text":"Excellent beef & turkey burgers ... And the fries were seriously yummy! All the sauces ... Make the experience fun. The restaurant is super modern and very appealing. There was s problem with my turkey burger not being fully cooked ... The manager apologized right away and took care of it immediately. This still gives them a 5 for overall experience, taste and value!"}
{"text":"The food is good but for the price the portions are small. The place is nice but staff need to do a better job a keeping it clean and on service.. For the price go to Fat burger (across the street) and get a burger there.."}
{"text":"Yum!    Great burgers and shakes.  I increased the doneness of my burger based off the cashiers suggestion and wish I wouldn't have done that.  We got the undecided --  sweet potato fries and onion rings.  The different sauces are unique.  The workers here were very happy and upbeat!"}
{"text":"Walked from the Mandarin and was glad this place was close by. I was new here and the server made some good recommendations. I chose the LA burger. It was very delicious. I really liked the avocado relish, and the watercress was fresh. The restaurant is setup to where you seat yourself after you order, was confusing at first. But I will return:-)"}
{"text":"Its a must every time we go.... My daughters love this place. We go when we barley get to vegas and must before we leave Vegas. Hoping one day we run into him hahaha..."}
{"text":"As a fan of Bobby Flay, I expected better.  First the layout of this restaurant is funky. Family style decor.Several people were confused upon entry.  Do I just take a seat? Get in line or is that for to-go orders? WHAT DO I DO???!! We figured it out but many weren't so successful lol. We ordered the brunch burger crunchified (since Holsteins version was so good), the classic healthy style, sweet potato fries,  regular fries, cactus pear margarita,  and a red wine.  Brunch burger was suppose to be medium but no pink in sight. The chips were just... chips... kind of like Lays orginal. Unlike Holsteins which seemed kettle cooked. Salad was good not great,  lettuce was wilted so it became hard to pick up with the fork.  And no I didn't drench it with dressing. Margarita was delish and the wine was just wine --that you can just skip. Get two margaritas instead.  This place can be passed on our next visit."}
{"text":"Well this place was a bust i wont be back and I'm a local . The burgers where okay I could easily make them at home . My girlfriend used the restroom here and she said the ladies room was disgusting paper towels and toilet paper all over the floor and the stales had no toilet paper either along with over flowing tampon bin with used tampons hanging out so disgusting just visualize that  . I wouldn't recommend this place to any one . The men's room was just as bad as the women's restroom . Again I won't be back and I won't recommend this place to my friends or family"}
{"text":"*Three and a half stars*

Ate here recently while on vacay in Vegas. I ordered my burger medium. My husbands was perfectly cooked but mine was very rare and undercooked. 

It was hard to catch a waiters eye to request my burger be cooked further. When I finally spoke to someone, I got a very strange reaction. He seemed annoyed by my request and did not respond but appeared to walk towards the kitchen and I think he asked them to make me a fresh one which they eventually did. I was waiting a while to get it and I wasn't sure what was happening. I asked the same server if a burger was coming. It took about 15-20 minutes for another burger to arrive. I felt awkward and left in the dark due to the fact the server never told me what exactly was going on. 

All this aside the flavor was good and I enjoyed the taste. Just a bit of an awkward service."}
{"text":"The blue cheese burger is amazing. Everything I expected and more. The employees were friendly and funny. I'll definitely be back and recommend everyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I enjoyed my burger at Bobby's Burger Palace.  The prices are very reasonable and portrays a very interesting vibe inside.  You order at the front and then you sit at either a counter or a cafeteria area and they bring the food to you.  This burger has a chique feel to it, with chips offered to put on the burger for an extra crunch.  They actually have a decent selection of beer as well for not outrageous prices.  

If you're looking for a nice afternoon lunch or low key dinner, come here.  It won't blow you away, but neither will it disappoint.  It certainly won't break the bank like other strip restaurants."}
{"text":"Okay but not great. I expected more. The menu has nice selection, and the food was delivered quickly... But it didn't deliver as expected. The server was nice but disappeared to lunch break after running our food. Never seen again but that was okay. Out of four burgers all were over cooked (still a bit juicy but not as ordered) and one was so well seasoned it almost crossed the line into distasteful. The fries were good as were the onion rings. There were five onion rings in the order: one for each of us and one to share. Yay."}
{"text":"Good burger, unique sitting arrangement,  friendly staff.  Happy we tried it live the crunchified!"}
{"text":"Food: OMG 5 stars
Service: personalized. 5
Ambience: clean and nice view. 5 stars
Price: well, you are in Vegas. It is what it is! 
Coming back."}
{"text":"We came here because it was right across the street from where we were staying and it was definitely a good spot for a bite to eat.the burger was super juicy and really flavorful! We got the cheese and bacon fries and they were really good too! Overall the food really hit the spot and I recommend getting the burger with the chips on top it really adds a crunch that makes it even better (and unique to other burger places as well)! Prices are very reasonable so if you're looking for good food on the strip without breaking the bank I think this is the perfect spot!"}
{"text":"The brunch burger with chips was really good. Fries were just average. I hated the fact that I had to ask for mayo after getting my food. Mayo should come on the side or already on the table. However, the staff was really nice.

The coconut pineapple rum shake was good, not great. Wish it had more coconut and pineapple flavor.

I do like that the soda fountain is self service so you can get refills.

All seats are communal.

Don't forget to show your M Life card, they offer 10% discount."}
{"text":"Great service, nice burger, good fries, slightly runny shake. I would go again but shake shack down the street is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Solid burger but small with delicious and create  fixins....fast friendly super service.

But it's a bit pretentious , trying to be both chi chi and retro diner. . But he once value rain isn't here,  maybe because f the pricy real estate upon the strip.

SMASGHBURGER is way better"}
{"text":"Good place. They stayed open past closing and accommodated a group up us including the 2017 Mr Olympia figure champion cydney gillon . Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I ordered just a simple burger nothing special.

I have to say this burger was just that simple and great.  One of the best actual burgers i have ever eaten.

This burger was ordered medium it came out medium well but it was still juicy as hell.... just dripping with juice and perfectly tender. And then bun was was the best bun if ever had on a burger.....

Bobby flay needs to open up more of these expecially closer to my house.... lol....

A must try burger...."}
{"text":"Amazing. You can actually taste the beef in their burger. Great seasoning. Had the New Mexico burger (crunchified). It was great. Heat. The cheese, the pickled red onions were a perfect compliment to the green chilis. Ordered a Mesa margarita.  Perfect. The fry sauce was perfect."}
{"text":"I love the concept here. I've been to Mesa Grill here in Las Vegas nearly 50 times so I figured might as well give Bobby Flays other Vegas joint a try. This is no high end burger \"restaurant\" like Burgr Ramsey's place at Planet Hollywood. This is a walk up take your order McDonald's style and go sit and your food will be brought to you kinda place. Well not exactly the same they actually ask you how you would like your burger cooked which is a touch of class. 

Now the food! Okay, they have a pretty good menu here to appease most any burger lover. Bobby also added some awesome milkshake/malts which are always a great peering with burgers along with a Mesa grill addition with some knockout top shelf margaritas.

Overall skip the McDonald's and come have a try!"}
{"text":"Updating my review. Sticking with 4 stars. Been here several times already even though for a local it's a bitch to get to.  Food is always good and staff consistently nice.  As I previously mentioned, it would be nice if more toppings such as grilled peppers would be made available as a topping.  This place is a bit pricey but I am willing to pay top dollar for a good burger!"}
{"text":"Great burger! Burger was juicy along with the toppings. I had the Brunch burger which comes with a fried egg ( slightly runny-yummy), bacon and cheese. Great staff, especially the cashier as he was knowledgeable and kind. Very afforable. Glad I got to taste some of Bobby's creations-second hand but you get the idea. Yummy! Clean restaurant and staff continuously cleaning tables and going around area to be sure."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious revamping. I was walking the strip in need of a burger and I got one from this place. I waited at least 27 minutes for it to be ready. The patty was extremely dry, I asked for no pickles, they put five. I brought it back to exchange for something else, but they refused because they were \"busy,\" however there was no line.

Bottom line, I was very un-satisfied with my experience at this establishment and I hope they take this review into consideration."}
{"text":"So this spot is more Shake Shack/Five Guys than The Counter/Gordon Ramseys.  This is okay if you are looking for a reasonably priced, good tasting burger.  The selections are straightforward, except for the potato chip \"twist\".  That reminded me of when I used to put corn chips in my tuna sandwiches when I was a kid!  Nice flashback for me!

The regular and sweet potato fries were not fried enough though so they were a bit too soggy for our tastes.  We liked the idea of walking up to place our order and sitting anywhere you want to wait for your food to be delivered.  It's a simply decorated spot that can remind you of a modern diner.

Nice idea/concept but work on the fries!"}
{"text":"Delicious, not one to eat at the \"as seen on tv spots\", but was frankly impressed here. Burgers are delicious and ingredients are fresh, had a Chicago burger, amazing, from bun to party everything in between was amazing. Great for kids, family atmosphere."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to BBP my wife and I had to share 2 burgers fries and onion rings. After sitting down to enjoy our meal we were greeted by the manager who refunded us $10 that we were mistakenly overcharged. This impressed me greatly. Our food arrived promptly and looked fantastic. Our server explained the variety of special sauces available. The food was amazing. Well seasoned burgers but slightly overdone. Fries were cooked perfectly, and accompanying sauces were great. I truly enoyed all BBP had to offer including the great service. After comparing our burger the philly stood out with the grilled onions and peppers. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"Tasty and big portions.  Great location, clean - good selection.  Service was super friendly but they took a long time to bring the milkshake.  We were almost finished with our meal before it arrived.  The portions are huge.  I suggest you share fries with your friend instead of each getting one.  The fries come with a couple of sauces that were both awesome.  (Spicy creamy one and a garlicky one) The onion rings were good too.  Burgers were very good.  I thought the prices were pretty high but that's typical for this part of the strip."}
{"text":"We just eat at Bobby' s burger place in Vegas and encountered a little critter....too bad, not a clean place"}
{"text":"I can't say anything about the food because we only ordered drinks but holy cow were the drinks good! There was no wait, we popped right in, ordered, and were out the door with our drinks in less than 10 minutes. It smelled delicious, though, and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love Bobby Flay but why is this place not better???? 

I had the Dallas burger with bbq chips on the burger. That is the barque sauce and coleslaw on the burger. Everything on the burger was good but the meat felt really bland! 
Whyyyyy???? 

I also ordered the dark chocolate shake and that is a no brainier. It was delicious. The fries were really salty and bland also!
Whyyyyyy????

I want to love you! Let me love you! 

Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Whatever happened to Bobby's \"Big, Bold, Flavor?!\"  It's alotta stuff piled onto a very bland burger with absolutely no flavor. Do yourself a favor...save some money, go across the street to Earl of Sandwich and get some of the best food on the strip. As far as burgers go, Bobby needs to go to Hardees/Carl's Jr. for a lesson in flavor."}
{"text":"Bobby's is by far our favorite burger place in town. You order in a fast food style where they take your order, give you a number, grab your drink and grab a seat. The seating is kind of weird where it's a whole table wrapped around with a bunch of chairs so you MIGHT end up sitting with someone else, but hey, maybe you can make some friends! :)

We have never had to wait in line a long time to put our order, even if there are several people ahead of us. They're usually pretty quick to get everyone through the line. The wait time for the food to come out is pretty standard, but we like to sit by the window and watch the people walking the strip so it makes the time go by quicker.

My husband and I usually both get the LA Burger and it is fantastic! So juicy and full of flavor. We have been there 5-6 times and the burger has always been the same quality. 

The fries are awesome too (haven't tried the onion rings yet) and the fry sauce is really good. Usually fry sauce is just a mix of ketchup and mayo but this is so much more and has a little kick to it. We also tried a coconut shake once and it was filled with flavor and even had little flecks of coconut in it.

This is a fabulous place to eat. The staff is friendly and the food is definitely worth the price. I would suggest looking on the website first to see the hamburgers, some of them are a little different than normal hamburgers."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Very juicy and flavorful. Also the milkshakes are out of this world. Reasonably priced too! I've eaten in Vegas for double or triple what I paid at Bobbys And the food sucked!"}
{"text":"Such a cute concept , great location . Simple but good food . Loved the Crunch burger ."}
{"text":"Burger was the only good thing.  Sweet potato fries were a little salty and the 50/50 with onion rings was nowhere close,  It was more 2 / 98.  For the price I expected a lot more.  Holsteins at Cosmo should have been my stop instead of here.  Sorry BBP you need some work."}
{"text":"Omg!! I am such a big fan of Bobby Flay, I had to come here when I was in town! I am so glad I did too! We ordered the months specials, strawberry shortcake shake, mulbury street burger, half onion ring and sweet potato fries, and another burger I can't remember but it wasn't that great, but was still good. Only thing we didn't like about it was the bbq sauce wasn't what was stated on the board. 

It would have been a 5 star but the guy at the counter couldn't answer half the questions we asked and our burgers were over cooked. 

But still delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was just ok....the burger would have been good, if the cook had not used soooo much salt! Their table talker states that they really want to hear from the customer, good bad or indifferent. Well, I sent an email (see below) and heard absolutely nothing back.....What a horrible lack of concern for quality. I have worked hospitality, and would not let something like this go by the wayside.
We won't be back, there are other places with better quality and service. And the apathy of management leaves a  lot to be desired....

Here is my email to the company:

\"Hey Guys:
I ate at the Las Vegas Location on May 25th, 2016......a major insult to the Palate. The table talker stated that each cook is trained to make a   burger EXACTLY the way Bobby Flay would make it. I have seen Food Network, and heard that he is the king of Burgers. We'll, when I bit into my burger (my wife also agreed) it was comparable to a  drink of the Atlantic Ocean. I told the waiter about it, and his response was \"Yeah, sometimes our guy gets a  little heavy with the  salt\"
Shame on Bobby, and Shame on the food industry for supporting this assault (or a salt) on the senses.
-Dave\""}
{"text":"This cute place is between Monte Carlo & Aria. I tried the crunch burger and mocha caramel milkshake. The milkshake was great! Smooth texture, not too sweet, & reminded me of kona coffee ice cream. My burger was ok. My fault for getting such a plain jane burger. Individiually, the meat was juicy, buns were toasty, & not like other places with messy burgers. Their sauces, esp the fry sauce is pretty yummy. I'd come back."}
{"text":"I take it Bobby didn't stop by the Vegas place much.  We walked past a buuunch of places  to get here because my wife's a fan and my boy wanted to try it out.  I thought I was at Burger King !  Lol. Ok. Read the idea behind it and thought ok I'm game, simple burger options kinda like a good food faster than a sit down restaurant but not \"fast food\". 
Not cheap but location dictates a higher cost. So let that go not out of line at all. 
But ummm. The service Was ALLLLL fast food  
Definitely don't tip when ordering. Cuz your never going to see them again!   My kids turned into servers for us though refilling drinks ect.  The people that worked there just kinda watched. 
The girl that took the orders was \"absent\"at best. 
The bathrooms were honestly something out of a roadside gas station.  Men's had overflowing  toilet and the floor was wet all across it. Eek."}
{"text":"Man, this place is awesome. This is hands down the best burger I've had in a fast food place. Ok, maybe it's a slight stretch to call it fast food... i.e. burgers are made to order, you sit down, they bring to you, there's no play land, etc. So maybe not technically fast food, but whatever. It's quick, really good, and cheap. Yes. Yes. Yes. 

Went here two days in a row and got two different burgers (the Carolina and the New Mexico). Both were very good and I really want to try more now. Just trying to tow the line of if it's really acceptable to have a burger from this place more than 3 times in a week. Oh well, who's counting?

Highly recommend. And I also recommend accepting if Bobby Flay is ever throwing a cook out and invites you over for a burger. And also grab me one, please. Thanks. 

Oh, also: Pro tip: crunchify. No brainer."}
{"text":"Came in here because I wanted to try Bobby Flay's take on burgers. The prices didn't seem to crazy either. 

As you enter, all their burgers are listed... the only one I remember is the one I got, which was the Crunch burger. It consisted of burger, cheese, potato chips, and from what I remember, I requested red onion, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise. We also ordered a side, \"half & half.\" Half fries, half onion rings. 
We sat ourselves in a huge cafeteria like setting. Bright green and all... there were a variety of sauces at the table. From bbq sauce to a jalapeño sauce.... 
It did not take too long to cook, it was out in less than 10 minutes. The burger looked great. Potato chips stacked high, cheese melted to the burger patty, lettuce, beautiful red tomato and red onion. The mayonnaise was on the side. The half & half came with only 2 onion rings and a hefty amount of fries- I would hardly call that half. 
My first bite into the burger, I noticed how juicy the meat was, as well as how salty. It was very salty for me. I took one more bite, and still the same. So I flagged down the girl who brought out our food and told her it was too salty for me. She informed me that, \"that is the Bobby Flay way\" and that they could remake it without the added salt. Which made me feel WONDERFUL! 
While they did that, I asked for ranch for my uneven \"half & half.\" 
Bobby Flay doesn't believe in RANCH?

Sad.

The 2 onion rings I got tasted good... the fries were pretty good too (but to pay a $1 more for half onion rings & half fries was not worth what I got.)

My new burger was out in less than 5 min. Looked as good as the one before. I mayo'd it up and bit in. Soooo much better! Still tasted the salty flavor from the grill, which was ok enough for me. 

The staff did a great job. The burger was great-without the added salt, and I think it was a delicious and unique take on the potato chip burger."}
{"text":"Bobby's burger was okay. It's a good spot to just drop in to get a quick bite to eat. I tried the crunchy burger (turkey) . They still brought me beef. It was okay. And you can also grab a quick drink. And catch up on some sports . . Basically and urban version of whataburger to me with a bar added."}
{"text":"First time here. One of the better burgers I've had. Brunch burger was great. Left well satisfied"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place from California and it's not what I really expected. By the time we got our burgers and fries, they were cold. We order cheese fries and I hoping for them to be warm with melting cheese but instead the cheese just stuck to fries cuz the cheese got cold. The burger was warm and it was ok."}
{"text":"Portions are small, but the beef burger is juicy and well-seasoned. You can get your burger without the buns and on greens! Out of all the combinations, I opted for the California without cheese, which came with tomatoes and avocado relish (aka guac). Would definitely get again!"}
{"text":"Sorry Bobby but nothing special about your burgers. They were sloppy, seemed to lack quality control and the bun was mushy fast. The sweet potato fries and onions rings weren't special either. Nothing worth going to in a town of so much.  Bobby stick to you trying to beat others and forget burger chains."}
{"text":"If you want a burger cheaper than $9.50 there is a McDonalds across the street just south of this. WARNING: Most time you get what you pay for. 

BBP is a franchise now. Hope this does not degrade the quality of the product over the long haul. For now, the one we have on the east coast that I frequent and this one both serve a #1 burger, so consistency is good in this case. 

I love the slathered on Avocado relish L.A. Burger. Nothing else needed; no ketchup, mustard or other sauce to muddy the taste the chef designed. I wanted to try a \"Spiked Milkshake\" but that sounded like a stand-a-lone meal order or a good hangover cure type order, price $9 bucks. Next time perhaps. 

There was no line when I ordered but by the time I left, about 20 minutes, the line was out the door, at noon. Plan ahead."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was good and plenty of it.  I had the chili burger, buddy had the same along with chili cheese fries and another buddy had the English pub burger.  The menu is basic; full bar, dessert menu and a variety of burgers to choose from.   Located inside New York, New York on the first floor where all the shops are; past the gaming area.   Service was friendly and they seem to have a pretty good system to get food out.   For burger and a beer you're looking at about 15.   Not bad for being just off the strip"}
{"text":"Amazing! Located center strip between the aria and Monte Carlo, this place is definitely worth the visit! 

We were craving burgers after seeing the Knights game so we turned to Yelp and stumbled upon this place- glad we did! Bobby's Burger Palace is a quick 5 minute walk from the arena and I'd say one of the better options for a quick bite within the area. You order at the front, seat yourself, and your food is brought out to you; so more like a quick-service as opposed to full on restaurant style.

We ordered the Greek burger and \"The Bobby\" along with a side of sweet potato and garlic fries- all of which were delicious! Cooked perfectly to our medium rare requests and full of flavor- and the fries were crispy and well- seasoned. I wouldn't call the burgers \"gourmet\" but more like a high end In-N-Out with more options. 

Great experience and our cravings were fulfilled! Oh and get the cookies & cream shake it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I dislike Bobby Flay as a human being.  His appearance on Iron Chef years ago really showed he was a bit of a scumbag, and his various shows on Food Network all show him to be a bit of a jerk.  

That being said, this place is pretty awesome.  Everything about the food is good, and for being in the middle of the strip and having a chef's name attached to it, the prices are very reasonable.  Two complicated burgers and fries for under $25.  

I got the monthly special which was a western bacon cheeseburger (called the Cheyenne) and fries.  I got my burger crunchified, which is putting plain or BBQ Lays chips on the burger (the option is free).  Every part of the burger was good.  Cooked perfectly, nice soft bun, and the fries are amazing.  They say the fries are never frozen and I feel like I can taste that.  I think the other place that does this is In-n-Out although I do not like their fries at all.  

Anyway, I'll definitely be going back.  I want to try more specials!"}
{"text":"The burgers were okay - had the brunch burger, crunchy burger, and cheese fries. We had ordered both burgers medium but it came well done. The burger were a little too salty to my liking and the cheese fries were also salty and soggy."}
{"text":"DONT SIT AT BAR BARTENDER LADY WITH BLACK HAIR WILL CHANGE UR RECEIPT I called when I noticed on my account some how my 1 burger and 1 water cost 29.00 Sorry sweety I never tip that much scamming dirt bag I wish I had a photo of her nd her name the people who answer it seems like it's a game they do BECAREFUL dispute with cc now sad"}
{"text":"The burgers are a great value! Quality meat and great topping choices! You can tell this place has bobby flays name on it! The staff is phenomenal! Get in before people find out how good this place actually is! 

We had the brunch burger and the egg was so savory! Try the chipotle ketchup as well! It's bomb!"}
{"text":"I've been here and I've been to the one in Philly.  It's a fancy burger place, but I can't say that the burgers wow'd me.  I'm mostly a burger purest anyhow - so all the fancy combinations and toppings (for me) tend to muddy the good 'ol taste of the burger.  Call me basic.

Service was really good though and we definitely got full."}
{"text":"Bobbies burger place has a cool feel. Great seating. Ordered a chicago burger..topless..no bun. 
Overall good burger. The fries seemed to have been beer battered... Nor sure if i like that made them a bit like arbies curly fries..:)
Also indulge in the Vanilla burbon shake.. Very smooth.
4 out of 5 for the fires alone."}
{"text":"Got the cactus pear margarita to go. Tasted like plastic and was too thick to drink. Disappointing at best."}
{"text":"Burgers were great, service was decent... But maybe because I'm from SoCal and have been exposed to tons of these taco trick style burgers, I wasnt totally impressed. The burgers were somewhat small... At least as far as the parties were concerned and slightly on the dry side. =(

3.5 stars for atmosphere
3 stars for food
3 stars for service"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had the pleasure of being served by James. He had great recommendations and hilarious stories. Had the LA burger topless (which James said would be great) and enjoyed it so much my plate was spotless."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend to grab lunch on a Monday afternoon.  The place was pretty dead, but the food was great!  The price for a burger, side of sweet potato fries, and a fountain drink was less than 20 bucks...pretty decent for a full meal on the strip.  The staff were really friendly and it was a great experience overall.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"These burgers are delicious, i had family in town and found myself on the strip, so i tried it, and i am so glad that i did, if it wasn't such a task to park, i would patronize this place more often...Great burger!"}
{"text":"I had the New Mexico burger it was so amazing with the peppers and cheese sauce and fries melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I guess it's a good trip to Vegas when your only regret is that you couldn't go to the same restaurant twice! We came for lunch on our first day and only had salads because we were in pre-pool mode and wanted to fit into our swimsuits.  Lol

First, let me point out that the service was memorably--yes, the service at this quick service restaurant was pleasant, sweet and attentive.  Second, both the burger and the chicken (on our salads) were absolutely delicious. Both pieces of meat were fresh, juicy and cooked perfectly.  

Can't wait to go back! Good job, Bobby. :)"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, other than it served me the WORST burger I've ever had in my life..
My husband and I decided to split a burger..and we got the stupid Crunchburger because my husband apparently likes to torture me.
It literally is just a cheeseburger with some cheap potato chips piled on it. Cheap bun, meat isn't seasoned, and a big honkin pile of cheap ol potato chips. 
I was so infuriated eating this burger. Just picturing Bobby Flays smug face peering out from the darkness laughing at me while I choke down this soulless creation.
It's one of those meals you know you could make better yourself, but instead you pay a million dollar chef to mess it up for you.
Yes, I'm aware Bobby isn't back there smashing chips on the \"burgers\" himself....but...I mean...are you aware of how BAD these taste, Bobby? Time to take over for awhile and reclaim this palace of yours. 
NEVER. again."}
{"text":"The name of Bobby's Burger Palace reminds me of that TV show Bobby's World for some reason.  That has nothing to do with this restaurant or review, but whatever.

My friend & I were in Vegas for the weekend.  We had plans Sunday night, but of course we wanted to grab a bite to eat first. We didn't have a ton of time, and since we were staying near Bobby's and Yelp reviews were pretty good, we decided to try it out.

We walked in and the line wasn't too long. It was a little slow, but I was being indecisive on what I wanted anyway, so this gave me a little time to figure out what I wanted.  The burgers are on the gourmet (if you will) side (though you can get something more simple, I'm sure).  I opted for the Bobby Blue -- blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, & tomato -- crunchified (with potato chips on it).  I always order sweet potatoes when they're an option, so that was my side.  I wanted to try a spiked milkshake but didn't; maybe next time!

After ordering, you take your number and can pick your own seat (They do have carryout as well.).  The decor is clean and bright; I really enjoyed the look of the place.  We sat down, and our food came out as ordered in a timely fashion. After taking a quick picture of my burger for Yelp, I dug in.... and it hit the spot!  The sweet potato fries were on point, and the burger was exactly what I wanted. It was how I ordered it (crunchified and well done).  The chips were a fun addition.

Overall, we had a great experience and meal at Bobby's Burger Palace. I would gladly go back here.  If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive (compared to other places nearby), good, and quick meal, this fits the bill.  It seemed like there might be a little room to grow and the line did take a little time, so I docked a star. Still--I really enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"From the outside, Bobby's Burger Palace looks super enticing with its vibrant colors and game like charm.

I ordered the bacon bleu burger with added chips (no cost extra) and bacon cheese fries.

The burger was huge! However, I felt like the patty was dry, and I expected it to be more aesthetically pleasing. It looked like a burger patty I could buy in a pack of Costco. Overall, the burger was ok. 

I didn't realize there was an assortment of sauces until after I started eating my burger so I tried it with the bacon cheese fries. I was expected crispy fries with loaded cheese and bacon. There was a light sprinkle of cheese. It was mediocre at best.

I heard Bobby Flay does come in time to time to check in, and I really think he should do some flavor quality control with this place. I expected better and I have to say I was disappointed."}
{"text":"The burger was great (LA Burger), but the star was really the chipotle ketchup that is on the tables! I had it with my sweet potato fries and found it to be better than the sauce provided! Tangy and zesty!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. It was really good, but the bun needed something? It was dry and cold. It needed to be cooked better. The fries were awesome and so were the drinks. Would definitely eat here again if I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place, burgers were juicy and the condiments were perfect, the spices just right and service was good, can't beat happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"I gave Chef Gordon a 3 for lack of flavor.  I'm going to have to give Chef Bobby a 2 for too much flavor.   This place is not in a casino or hotel so the prices are not super inflated.  We ordered the onion rings 4.25, Dallas burger 9.5, Palace burger 9.5r and a soda.   The batter to onion ratio was good.  The onion rings were thickly cut with a fried chicken coating.  This might sound good but consider that chicken is bland and needs a flavorful coating.  A cooked onion is sweet and only needs a subtle flavor to complement it.  The fried chicken batter totally overwhelmed the onion.  The accompanying sauces were all too salty except for regular ketchup.  Onion rings typically go well with ranch. Consider it Chef Bobby. 

The burgers were way to salty.  One was inedible.  I looked into the kitchen area to see what they were doing and saw them streaming salt from a shaker onto the flat top.   There was more salt coming down than what usually goes on a batch of fries.  Note that a batch of fries serves dozens.   Each burger only needs a pinch of salt.  I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is probably your best bet after spending so much money on other restaurants on the strip. The prices are decent around $10-15 for burgers (depending on which one you want)The burgers and fries will make you full. Carolina burger is my favorite. They have the best milkshakes ($7). I tried pistachio and cream&cookies and I loved both. I would go there again. I heard there is Bobby's burger palace in Manhattan. I would defiantly check it out."}
{"text":"the good reviews here must have came from yelpers who had some alcohol. cause i can honestly tell you being a sober yelper on the strip i was excited to try out BBP. especially with all of the great reviews. 

you order first and find a seat. the food will be brought out to you. you get to choose between three types of meat (beef, chicken & turkey)

ordered:
*bacon crunch burger $9.95 w/beef - provided very little potato chips inside. it did not look anything like the advertised photos. 
*brunch $10.95 w/beef

the burgers were overly cooked and dry. lacked flavor, you would think that if bobby flay has his name on something then the food must at least be flavorful. presentation wise the burgers looked like i made it at home with no culinary experience. 

the inside was a bit dirty like they had a crazy rush and not enough staff to clean the place. when i arrived they had customers but i wouldn't say they were packed. they needed more staff around to clean the place up for sure. food took a hot minute to arrive. would this yelper return to BBP? sadly, nope! i was so disappointed at my experience that, my calories and hard earned money will be dining elsewhere. BBP is definitely a tourist trap. 

tips:
*restroom available
*high chair available
*free refills as its fountain drinks
*cash and credit card accepted
*indoor seating only
*the bobby stands for bobby flay.
*you can request chips on any of your burgers at no additional cost"}
{"text":"I had the New Mexico chicken sandwich; it was delicious. The place was very clean & the service was excellent.  Sweet potato fries & onion rings also very good."}
{"text":"The cashiers are nice but the food was mediocre considering its bobby flay. The sauces for the French fries are runny and I was hoping for a thicker consistency closer to that of ketchup. For a $10 burger I expected more. I've been twice and I didn't think it was anything special that I would go again."}
{"text":"If you step in this palace, please get the Cheyenne Burger. It's a monthly special so hurry up. Let me talk about this burger, it contains a patty, a patty to rival all patties you have ever dared to taste. The medium patty is juicy, pink like a freshly born baby, and tastes crisp, as if you bit into the old spice commercial guys arm. On top of that patty lies two strips of bacon in an X formation. This bacon has been breaded in something mystical, to create a cohesive taste experience that you have never before felt. Then resting on top of that bacon is onion strips that sting your mouth like a biting Python. Then drizzled on top of that beauty is a barbecue sauce. This is a slightly above average barbecue sauce but when you add the burger sauce on it, it turns into a sauce that makes you smile with glee as it coats the inside of your mouth. When you bite into this burger all these elements blend together and your eyes start to tear up in shocking happiness, you have found the burger of your dreams. You have found euphoria at last."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic the people were friendly and the inspirational signs on the wall was awesome
We will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Very yummy food for a quick stop on the strip! We are visitors to the Las Vegas area and had to stop in here, because we absolutely love Gordon Ramsey's BURGR, so trying out Bobby Flay's joint was a must! The burger combos are interesting, but neat and surprisingly good! The shake was good, but very overpriced for the size. The onion rings were amazing and the cheddar ranch was delish! Nice ambience for a quick meal too!"}
{"text":"What a find!  Had a delightful experience - Bobby's Burger Palace is definitely one of the best value eats on the strip!  

Our orders included the brunch burger, the chicken crunchburger, regular fries, and bacon cheese fries.  Admittedly I screwed up when ordering (am lactose intolerant, forgot to ask for no cheese), but the server was gracious in fixing my mistake!  This alone is worth a 5* review, to say nothing about the delicious food.

As a Coloradan, beer taps in Vegas are almost always disappointing, but it was nice to see a few beers not carried in bulk on the strip (sure, I am happy to drink Rebel IPA and Lagunitas IPA, but do these HAVE to be the only craft beers consistently available on the strip!?) - the Ballast Point draft was refreshing!

Staff was quite friendly, accommodating, and the burgers were delicious.  Fun, bright layout, and worth a visit by any Vegas-goer!"}
{"text":"Love it . I order the classic burger and sweet potato fries ... medium on the meat .. the sweet potatoe fries are super fresh and love the sauce .. I also order the mint chocolate chip ... horrible .. the mint is overwhelming ... everything else including the staff is friendly . Will be back. When ever I'm in vegas"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Me and my boyfriend are obsessed with Bobby flay and have been to his fancy restaurant before and loved it, and loved the idea of this cheap but \"fancier\" fast food place. I got the LA burger, crunchified it was delicious, my boyfriend got the burger with the bacon and egg and the egg was over cooked and the burger wasn't anything special. I would come back and probably get the same LA burger crunchified! Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"We ordered the Palace turkey burgers with fries and onion rings and a lemonade on the side. Food was great! Husbands burger was a little salty so we asked for a remake. He had already eaten about half the burger and when his new order came out he ate all except one bite. So.....very good and filling. Worth the money. Wanted to try a milkshake but I was drinking so....yeah...you understand. Great burger spot on the strip."}
{"text":"In town for vacation and was originally going to go my favorite burger place Burger lounge but then noticed Bobby's burger palace and thought it was worth giving it a try. New Mexico turkey burger was delicious, onions rings even more so. Got the undecided half and half with fries which meant only 3 onions rings which was unexpected but our awesome server Enzo fixed that - giving us a couple more on the house. Also our cashier gave us a free drink. Was a good decision to try something new!"}
{"text":"This is a good, affordable option right on the strip. I got the brunch burger and it was perfect. The bun was toasted, the cheese was melted, and the egg was perfectly fried. The bacon was crispy and had great flavor. 

I also got the vanilla-caramel bourbon shake. It might be the best shake I've ever had. I sat at the bar around noon on a Saturday and was in and out in less then 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I had the Palace Classic Burger, made of an Angus beef patty - topped with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion - and it was perfect!

The service was fast and efficient.  It was really busy today, and the servers were really working hard and did a great job.

All in all, a great place to eat.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Boo!! I expected more from a restaurant by Bobby Flay. I used to be a huge fan of his-until this experience.

I ordered the bobby blue burger, crunchified, expecting to be blown away. Instead I received an underseasoned, overcooked tiny burger patty with soggy bacon. What a combo. I expected the chips to be homemade, but they tasted like lays original. My husband ordered the new mexico chicken. While the toppings were flavorful, the chicken portion was also tiny and overcooked. I guess its probably hard to cook miniature food. We also ordered the onion rings and sweet potato fries combo. The onion rings were tasty, hence the 2 stars, but the fries were soggy and lacked salt. The sauce tray was also a miss. None were really special, so I just stuck to ketchup. 

Pricing is what one would expect on the strip, but the value is lacking. This place epitomizes the worst of Vegas. All show, no go. I am sorry I got suckered into eating mediocre food just because a celebrity chef's name was attached to it."}
{"text":"Update:  after receiving response, I immediately contacted them.  They had no clue why I was contacting them so I copied the review and response to them.....no response back."}
{"text":"We were expecting a pretty decent burger since Bobby Flay's name is on it, but ended up quite disappointed. The fried egg on my brunch burger was overdone. I was expecting the egg dripping out when I cut it, no, yolk is cooked. The buns were flat like those you buy from the grocery stores. Need to put those chipotle and jalapeno sauces to get more seasoning. The salad would be better if it has more dressing, totally under dressed. For the price, we prefer Bachi Burger, that is where we will go again next time instead."}
{"text":"I ordered the green Chile burger and onion rings to go. Burger cooked a perfect medium. It was a little spicy w/ the Chiles partially offset by the great pickled onions queso cheese and burger sauce (which I added). Onions rings with ranch on the side were fantastic. Great place, will visit again to try a different burger !"}
{"text":"I was in town for Los Angeles for my uncles birthday and I have to admit;  I wasn't sure what to expect from this place. I in return loved it. I always can have a great burger and fries. This place is doing it right. I mean its bobby flay's place for crying out loud. I regret not taking pictures. 

We had some drinks in the hotel so by the time we made it to dinner we felt pretty good. Between all of us we ordered a different burger so that we can each try something different. I ordered the blue cheese burger, which I love to begin with. I was really satisfied and they have a full bar. The hours were pretty great and the location is right on the strip so its hard to miss this place. Great job staff and team, keep it up. 

Next time I'm in Vegas I will be sure to come back here again. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay and I know he can rock a burger, so I was really pumped when I found out that his Burger Palace was super close to my hotel.  

The decor is simple, and the restaurant is massive.  You'll have no problem finding a seat, even if it's busy.  

I like the variety in burgers and sides that are offered.  You absolutely have to get a burger with chips.  Such a simple idea, I don't know why I never thought of it before.  That delicious crunch of a regular chip on a cheesy burger is perfection.  The onion rings are great.  They are huge slices of onion - easy to share with a friend.  

Burgers and milkshakes go great together.  I'm didn't try a spiked one...just sounds weird to me to have a spiked milkshake, but they seem to be a hit.  

I like the casual feel to this burger joint.  You order up front, take a seat and they bring the food to you.  The staff are friendly, and there are lots of them if you need anything.  They have a bit of outside seating, a long bar-like seating along the window which is good for people watching along the strip.  

They also have a few items you can buy to take home (apparel, sauce, spices etc.)"}
{"text":"I suppose I expected a bit more from Bobby Flay. It was just OK. Burger was a bit salty. Customer service was good. Staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger place! Located on the Strip right next to Mandarin Oriental / before Aria! Always wanted to try this place out, and so glad I got the chance to! The menu is right next to the registers, and if you're eating here, they give you a number and will bring the food out to you!

I got the New Mexico, with a regular beef patty and crunchified, which means they just put potato chips in your burger, an order of the half fries/ half sweet potato fries, and a Cactus Pear Margarita!

The burger itself was juicy and pretty hefty! The jalapenos in the burger is what made it for me. I'm usually not a huge fan of jalapenos in stuff, but these were delicious! It brought all the flavors of the burger together.

The fries were alright, nothing really stood out about them. What was good though was that horseradish mustard dipping sauce! I kept eating fries because of that sauce! If you don't get fries, just ask for the sauce, pretty sure it'll be delicious on a burger too!

The margarita was also pretty good, had good flavor - can't really describe it, just kind of fruity. The cup is small, definitely wish there was more of it!

Overall, quick and easy place to grab food at if you're in Vegas! You are dining on The Strip, so it does get pricey, but worth a try in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Now this is a burger place. I ordered the crunch burger and it was great! The meat was filled with flavor and thick, possibly half pound burgers. It was definitely bigger than a quarter pound. Then the different sauces at the table was great to place on the buns. Everyone was so happy with there meal. The fries tasted freshly cut and had a good amount of salt. This in my opinion is the best priced burger joint on the strip.  Also the best tasting burgers"}
{"text":"Our final stop on this trips vegas celebrity chef food tour. 

This is my second go around with BBP as we visited here once before about 6 years ago when we were in Philly. This BBP is on the strip in Vegas. We pretty much ordered every freaking burger on the menu including the veggie burger. Also, the fries, onion rings, and 2 milk shakes. Overall, the burgers are very good. The beef  (and veggies)  were seasoned very well. The cheese is melty and the toppings matched well with the overall description. The onion rings were not as good as I remembered. The batter wasn't the way I wanted it to be. It was flimsy this time. The fries were also just okay. 

Overall, I definitely would go back. 

However, Gordon Ramsay Burger is still one star better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and very friendly staff.  Margaritas are very strong but sooo good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great. I'm not much of a burger person but my boyfriend insisted on eating here so obviously I gave in. And I'm glad I did. I had the Miami burger, medium rare and it was awesome. The meat was juicy and the burger overall was better than any burger I've ever had. I also had the mint chocolate chip malt and boy was that amazing. I'll definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Super convenient location, right on the strip in front of the City Center near Aria. Fantastic service. Everyone we encountered was courteous, helpful, and friendly. We ordered and had our food in a flash. They served my wine in a cute little plastic, BBP, to go cup.  Tasty burgers at reasonable prices. We chose the Bobby Bleu and the Philly. If I could figure out the magical seasoning formula, I would make it the mandatory mix for every burger in the world. My world, of course.  The onions and peppers accented the burger perfectly, without overwhelming it. All the various sauces were fun to sample. 

I didn't find out about the whole crunchify thing until it was too late, but I probably don't need the extra calories anyway."}
{"text":"This is the best food and value on the strip!  There are so many restaurants on the strip but so many are over priced and some are over priced and not even good food!  BUT, we came across Bobby's Burger Palace one early afternoon and stopped in for a burger.  The menu was very interesting and it made making a decision very hard - you wanted to try it all!  We placed our order and WOW, what a great place this was!!  From the girl who took our order, to the person cleaning the tables, to the person who brought our order, to the look and TASTE of the food - burgers, AMAZING - onion rings, AMAZING - Milkshakes, AMAZING!  I had to get up at the end and ask to speak to the manager, Lisa.  She came out and I just had to tell her what a well oiled machine she was running!  Everyone worked as a team and the food was superb!  I told her that it all starts at the top which meant she really cared about the product and the customer!  I'm thrilled that Bobby Flay wanted to give something to Vegas that everyone can enjoy at a great value!  And Bobby should be proud that Lisa and her team are taking that value and giving it 5 star quality and service!! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Delicious Turkey Burger!!! Very well seasoned.  No condiments needed. The spiked caramel milkshake was amazing"}
{"text":"Brunch burger and veggie burger were outstanding!! And the mint chocolate chip shake was outstanding. The fries were okay at best."}
{"text":"First: no gluten free bun and NO lettuce wrap option. WTF Bobby???  Spend a dollar and buy a head of butter lettuce. It's not that hard. We shouldn't have to tell you this stuff.

My \"Crunchburger\" served \"open face\" like an effing salad had dressing on the side (which I specifically told them not to do) and NO CHIPS. Seriously? You're the one who called it a Crunchburger, Bobby. When I pointed this out, the server brought me a TINY condiment dish with a few chips and some crumbs in it.

Bad service may be acceptable in New York, but in Vegas there are better options. I recommend you try them. In-N-Out is just down the street..."}
{"text":"Disappointing burger!! Not what I expected from Bobby's Burger Place. The bun was not toasted and was so soggy that it was glued to the patty. The burger tastes like a frozen burger. I couldn't eat the burger and had to throw it out. My experience was brought to the manager's attention who promised to fix the problem."}
{"text":"Quite possibly, the best hamburger that I've ever eaten.  During the consumption of the Bobby Bleu Burger I was heard to say \"I don't want this to end.\"  Batter on the onion rings was delicious and again, perhaps the best I've ever had.  Fries & rings came out hot and not greasy.  Two thumbs up, if not more.  (Price for the burger and fries/rings was not bad actually.  Price for the shake was a bit high).

Two thumbs up for:  taste, quality, service.  Would return more frequently if it weren't for the restraining order."}
{"text":"Outstanding burger! Rare occasion where the patty outshines the toppings. It doesn't matter which burger you order, they are all delicious because the burger patties themselves are out of this world!"}
{"text":"One of the best veggie burgers I have had! They have a huge selection of burgers to choose from and have good service. This place is a must visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Perfect meal before you leave Vegas. You can also add potato chips to your burger which I wish I would have done. GET A MILKSHAKE. Their chipotle-ketchup was delicious."}
{"text":"Bobby's Burger Palace is delicious! I ordered the New Mexico burger with turkey, and my husband ordered the Dallas burger with beef. We decided to try the Undecided, and got a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. We sat down and the food came pretty quickly! The turkey patty was perfectly cooked, dry at all. I loved the chopped green chilies and pickled onions, so the New Mexico burger was a great choice. My husband loved his burger and had no complaints. 

The regular fries were alright, but got soggy pretty fast. The sweet potato fries were great though! Both fry sauces were good too. 

Compared to Gordon Ramsey's Burger, Bobby's Burger Palace totally blows it out of the water. The prices are better and the quality of the food is the same, if not better. We definitely liked Bobby's a lot and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"\"LA Burger\" is pictured here. 

Burger was yummy. Loved the \"Avocado Relish\"! I was satisfied for sure, but definitely nothing to write home about. I wouldn't dream about or crave for this burger. 

The onion rings get two thumbs down! NO flavor at all and cut WAY too big for my liking. (Holsteins has the BEST, hands down!)

Whole meal cost me $15 without a drink (just had water).

All in all, I would label this a \"quick eats\" joint for those who don't want to spend too much money on the LV Strip."}
{"text":"Did not try the food however ended up leaving before ordering .... the line was 5 persons one cashier every person is completely confused on customizing their burger so after 10 min only two people ordered .... the line now was about 15 people ..... ended up leaving it's a burger place shouldn't take 10 min waiting in line to order ..... food looks good and the turkey chicken and beef options are great if you can ever place an order....."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! The burger sauce is incredible, but the burgers didn't really need it at all. Perfectly cooked and delicious. It was also a very affordable lunch while walking the strip. My wife and I shared a burger and it was just enough without weighing us down too much. The lemonade was perfect, and the onion rings were perfect."}
{"text":"Food is less than expected. And the prices are a bit high, definitely expected since its on the strip. Habit is a much better option if you can venture off the strip a mile."}
{"text":"Bobby Flay is my chef boyfriend, in case you didn't know that.  I happen upon Bobby's Burger Palace when walking down the strip in Vegas and of course I had to eat there. They have a great menu to pick from and you can get any burger crunchified. Meaning, they put potato chips on the burger, and it is free. I selected the palace classic with grilled onions. Brian went with the Vegas and made it crunchified. Amazing, juicy, dripping with love, this burger was perfect. I know that sounds extreme, but it was in all fairness, perfection. On top of everything, the staff was extremely friendly and always smiling. Everyone looked like they love their job!  I am elated that we found this burger place and we will definitely frequent it every time we go to Vegas.  If you want an awesome burger and love Bobby Flay, then go to Bobby's Burger palace!"}
{"text":"Yesterday while in Vegas I was craving a burger and found Bobby's burger palace and was so excited. I have eaten at Bobby Flays other restaurants Mesa grill and Bar Americain and the food at both places were just amazing. I order the bacon and cheeseburger and a unsweetened tea. My burger was to be cooked medium. I went and sat down and saw the sauces on the table and checked them out. And tasted them all. I really didn't like the burger sauce to me it didn't seem right for a burger. I also tried the chipotle ketchup that was had a nice flavor profile. My burger comes out and I notice that it looked preformed, though I may be wrong that means it could be frozen. I remove the bun from my burger and put some burger sauce on it and try it again. I just did not like it on the burger. And the bread was not soft it felt a little hard. Though I had a not so great experience I will give it another shot when I return to Vegas, after all it is Bobby Flay.."}
{"text":"Delicious. Exactly what you'd expect from Bobby. We've been here 4-5 times now, it's pretty much become a necessary stop every Vegas trip. I usually keep it simple and stick with a traditional Crunchburger...just cheese and potato chips as toppings and I'll add the different sauces provided at the tables as I eat. Nothing fancy just good quality. Burgers are always consistent. Shakes are awesome, tried a pistachio one for the first time today. A little confused why this place only has 3 1/2 stars...staff has always been great to us and we've never had a bad food experience. Nothing but love, here! Thanks, Bobby!"}
{"text":"For a celebrity chef place in Las Vegas the prices are very reasonable. We got 2 burgers and onion rings and a soda for $35. I had the black and blue burger which was very tasty. My hubby had a green chilly burger with just the right amount of spice. There was a variety of sauces on the table, jalapeño, chipotle, and barbecue to enhance your burger experience. So... was it the best burger I ever had? No, but it was really good, inexpensive for Vegas and easy. It is an informal, but comfortable setting and the staff are very helpful! I hear the milkshakes are the bomb! If you need a quick bite, and did I mention there is a bar and multiple TVs, I highly recommend Bobbys Burger."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! All the burgers I tried were awesome! The shakes, fries, sauces are all different and with trying. No hype, it is really delicious, if you are ever in Vegas this is a must try! ... of course, if you like burgers!!! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger place.   From the staff to the food .   Bobby flay hit it on the nail.  Burgers were not greasy and the sides were awesome"}
{"text":"I kind of go back and forth on this. I wouldn't say yay I'm a fan because I'm really not sure I would return. I might if I tried a different burger. We tried a turkey with chiles and cheese. It was pretty spicy but the cheese wasn't detectable. Someone else had the blue cheese burger and it had too much cheese! 

I think there is almost too much going on in these burgers and the flavor profiles clash in some instances. The french fries were not very good at all so that's where they ultimately lost a star.  We tried Gordon Ramsay's Burger the next night and while pricier it is a far superior burger."}
{"text":"Have never been to a Bobby's Burger Palace, so during our week in Vegas we decided to try one for lunch.  Good burgers...great onion rings...but what made it was the bartender Austin.

We ate at the bar.  He was attentive, interested...never stopped cleaning....a pro.  Bobby, or at least the GM of this one...take note.  You have a great employee in Austin."}
{"text":"Minus one star for no veggie burger.  However, the staff are very helpful and friendly! I had the 'undecided' side order of half fries half onion rings.  Bobby- make a vegan burger!"}
{"text":"Thank you son for taking me to Bobby's Burger place. Normally I would never go to the strip for a burger but I am so glad I did. The minute you walk in the door you smell the food cooking and your mouth starts to water. They have several types of burgers on the menu and fries and shakes and depending on your taste they also have turkey burgers. I had the crunchy bacon burger which was amazing. The burger was cooked perfect and I loved the chips on the burger. Definitely something different for me. The sauces they have to dip your food in and your fries are amazing. I love the Bobby's barbecue burger sauce and the chipotle ketchup on my gosh A must try. My brother had a jalapeño barbecue and he loved it. I also had the pumpkin shake which was very good and I love how they give you a Big straw so it's easy to drink. The service was great food an came out on time and was cooked perfect, as we all had different ways we wanted them cooked. The restaurant was very clean and very busy. I also love how you can sit at the bar and order your food as well instead of ordering it when you first come in. The only thing I found a little annoying was Parking. You have to park in the Aria parking garage to get to it because there's no parking on the street of course because it's on the strip.  Even with that it was still well worth it. Everything else was amazing. I never probably would have tried it if it wasn't for my son visiting and taking us there. But I can guarantee you I will be back Bobby burgers definitely represents Bobby Flay."}
{"text":"This place is more like a 3.5 stars. Looking for a quick dinner before going out, a friend and I happened upon BBP. I wasn't super hungry so I ordered just a burger and iced tea. The Crunchburger sounded intriguing-american cheese and potato chips. I've put chips in my sandwiches before so why not my burger? The burger was super simple but surprisingly tasty. I think the quality of the beef really comes through. My burger needed a little something something so I added both ketchup and jalapeno hot sauce and it was perfect! My friend got an order of the sweet potato fries and they were fantastic. Probably some of the best I've had. 

I thought the prices were a bit expensive for just the burger ($8.50), but I later found out that BBP is so much cheaper compared to other places (I'm looking at you BurGR).

I think I would definitely come back and try more burgers the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Really impressed by their LA Burger! A bit pricey but totally worth it. The meat was tender, avocado relish was delish and their dressing options complimented every bite. 
The French Fries were Epic! Crunchy and  Fresh. For $4 we got fries enough for 2 of us and we were able to modify and get half sweet potato fries and half regular fries. 
The ambiance was cool, so much color and life in their building, the seating set up is different and very unique. 
Every time im in Vegas, I'll be visiting this place."}
{"text":"Awesome atomsphere.  Had the Carolina Burger with pickles, sweet potato fries, and a malt

Went with three others from work, everyone  loved it.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great burger place on the strip! There's a lot to the burger not huge but tons of yummy stuff inside. Can't go wrong with the LA served crunchy style! Super friendly staff too! Just an overall great place to go on the strip will not disappoint. They also serve spiked shakes!!"}
{"text":"Holy Jesus! Bobby knows what he's doing. Our burgers tasted like eating a fine dining steak. 
Cheap prices, delicious food. Don't walk past this place. You'll regret it"}
{"text":"A must for Vegas burgers. Holly is awesome - very nice and takes your order quick. Tbh dowloaded this app just to give a positive review. It was so tasteful and great atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Had to stop by during Christmas break...glad I did. My husband is a chef so we decided to do a little taste test between Bobby's Burger Palace and Gordon Ramsey's Burgr.  Bobbys burger won...we had the Dallas burger with the added bbq potato chips and it was bomb! Was better seasoned than Gordon Ramsey's burger. Enjoyed the fries a little more as well. Wish I tried the shakes, but will definitely be back to try next time"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas, it's a MUST for us to have a burger here. They are freaking amazing!!!!! Totally recommend this place to every single person."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and the manager Enzo is superb!  I have a severe gluten allergy and have celiac.  Enzo was helpful and personally took care of my order.  He is such an asset to the BBP team.  It is so nice to know I have food that is safe for me to eat.  I highly recommend BBP and ask for Enzo!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected from Bobby Flay.  It was less then what I expected in terms of the LA burger & the fries were just ok. Definitely won't be back & very disappointing. The In-N-Out burger we had in Vegas was much better then Bobby's."}
{"text":"Pros: Lots of seating, very modernized design, good place to go with a large crowd, not too far from MGM grand, Excalibur and New York New York (if you like staying at these hotels), fast service and tasty burgers.

Cons: It can be a little pricey for a burger and side but I think it's worth it.

I came here yesterday, Monday 5/25/15, with my boyfriend for a quick lunch. This is my second time at Bobby's Burger Palace (the first time was last August, while we were pretty buzzed and wandering the strip for a place to eat... stumbled upon Bobby's due to the nice big sign and bright enticing lights inside). Upon arriving (sober this time, by the way) it was a very short wait and we were able to decide on our orders before the people in front of us were done. Their menu is blown up and displayed on the wall so you can conveniently choose a meal -- divided by burgers, sides and drinks, nice and simple. I ordered the Brunch which consisted of a fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I chose certified angus beef as my protein (there's also ground turkey and chicken breast). I also got a half and half side -- fries and onion rings. We sat at these cool curvy diner type tables next to another couple. It took maybe 10 minutes for our food to arrive. You can watch the cooks through an opening between the kitchen and dining area. I knew which burger was mine as soon as the cook placed it on the counter. They have different sauces at the table that you can try. I tried them all on my fries and really liked the jalapeño sauce. The burger was cooked medium well, just like I like it. My boyfriend and I each got our own sides but decided in the end we could've shared one because they're pretty big (I took our left over fries and snacked on them at the penny slots). Come here if you're craving burgers and don't mind spending a little more for the flavor."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a good burger! We have been a few times and I always go for the brunch burger. The gooey egg and perfect cooked bacon makes it a messy yummy burger. 

I also think the onion rings are really good, they are to come with ranch sipping sauce and a few times they forgot but will bring it right back if you ask. The fries are really nothing special, I was hoping for better since the seasoned fries at lunch at Bobby's Mesa Grill in Caesars are so good. These taste like every typical hot dog stand.

The shakes are good and thick as well. We feel like the prices are slightly overpriced for what you get, and the fast casual atmosphere. But its Vegas, EVERYTHING is expensive! I don't know if I would make this the first stop on your trip but if you are hungry go get a burger!"}
{"text":"I had the Crunchburger and fries. It was basically a cheeseburger with potato chips. No lettuce, onion, or tomato. In fact, you add the condiments yourself so I guess it's similar to Fuddruckers in that respect. 

Let's start with the good. I thought despite the simplicity the burger tasted alright. The beef was on par with the patties at The Habit which is OK. It came with two slices of American cheese. I know some folks frown on that but I like American. It melts and engulfs the burger which I dig. The fries are good. They are like bigger cut versions of In n Out fries I suppose. 

Now the bad. A tad overpriced. Almost $9 for the burger, $4 for fries, and $3.50 for lemonade. As a guy that has paid upwards of $13 for a burger at Umami and BURGR I'm not against paying a premium for a hamburger, but I do expect premium ingredients if I'm going to do so. How about some grilled onions or some fancy sauce that'll knock my socks off? I'm not asking for 100% Prime Minotaur beef or anything just something other than potato chips to make the food stand out.

If the food was priced lower like say, The Habit then I would have given a 4 star rating for sure. I realize that celebrity branding is a reason for the high price but that also means high expectations from the consumer. 

Overall I'd be willing to give BBP another shot since they have lots of other burgers. Plus it's fun to sit there to eat and people watch. Go with a friend and watch dudes walk by with a girl and try to guess girlfriend or prostitute."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! We were  initially a bit turned off by the greasy smell walking into the place, but glad we decided to try it. The place was clean with modern seating. Fries were ok, but the burgers were perfectly seasoned and cooked. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Had the bobby blue burger and I must say it was one of the best burgers I have had. The blue cheese is do subtle there is no bitter aftertaste. If you get the burger cut it in half and add a little of the burger sauce that is on the table, you can't go wrong with that little bit of extra flavor. Sweet potato fries awesome and the lemonade is freshly made. Hell of a burger place ... Bobby Flay did this burger joint right!!! Sorry Gordon Ramsey burgr, you have been defeated!"}
{"text":"I am still teetering on giving this place a one or two stars. Completely not impressed. As someone else said they expected so much more from a celebrity chef's restaurant. I did also. So I go there towards the end of lunch, around 12:45, to my surprise the place is empty. For a restaurant on the strip just ending lunch, there was NO ONE in there. Should have been a warning sign for me. 
I was never a fan of Bobby Flay on tv or any of those celebrity chefs on the Food Network, but I would always want to at the very least try their food.  I have tried Mesa Grill and I that place really didn't impress me either. 
I got the Philly Burger, the concept wasn't bad. But this is where my issues start. I ordered the burger, medium rare. When I got the burger it was closer to well. I also ordered it \"crunchified\" but there were no chips in my burger. The onions were cut too larger and when I bit into the burger, the whole onion came out. The bun didn't taste as fresh and the burger was just, meh. Biting into the burger the bun was a little hard and broke apart and the burger fell apart when I ate it. I ordered onion rings, which tasted pretty good, but they were HUGE! like way to big, it was like eating half a whole onion. I only got like 4-5 pieces. 
I did like the chipotle ketchup, it complemented my burger, since there was no sauce in my burger. I got my burger to go, so I didn't see any of these things until I got back to my hotel. 
I don't think I'll be returning, this place showed so much promise, but came up flat."}
{"text":"I attended a Yelp event at Bobby's Burger Palace shortly after it opened and I've been intending to get back there.  My wife had never been there so we went last night.  We valeted at Mandarin Oriental and had a short walk to the back door.  The restaurant was fairly empty at 5:15.  The only people in line were Clark County firefighters from the local house by Vdara.

I got a bleu burger and my wife got a Miami burger .  We each got an order of regular fries as iced tea.  My burger was done rare and my wife's medium.  My burger was very juicy--my wife's less so but that's what happens when you cook it too much-the way she wants it.  The fries were good and I could become addicted to the chipotle mayo served with them.  

Service was quite good.  Different servers asked about iced tea refills and plates were removed in a timely manner so we could munch on our fries.

I wouldn't do this too often when I have a better choice near home, but when near CityCenter, the MO valet option makes this a place that will be on our list once in awhile."}
{"text":"absolutely nothing wrong with my burger.  tasted just fine. nothing spectacular either. i actually prefer BLT burger to this place

i hate to be the guy that bashes price.....but it is not worth the money. and the appetizer combo contained 2 onion rings on top of french fries. 

and strip location sucks! it is not east to get here. 
doubtful i will be returning"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, my second time here. The milkshakes are spectacular, the seasonal milkshake flavor of banana Nutella needs to be a regular item on the menu. This time around I had the strawberry milkshake and it has changed my life. I wish they had milkshakes like this in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken Phili and it had lots of flavor. I like the variety of sauces they have at the table . I tried the jalapeño  and chipotle on my sandwich. I also like the concept of ordering first then not having to worry about having a waiter."}
{"text":"I got the bacon crunch burger, which comes with the patty, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and potato chips. The flavor was whatever...kind of bland. So much so that I had to douse is in chipotle ketchup. The cheese was rubbery. The potato chips didn't seem to have been salted. The bottom bun was soggy. It just wasn't a good burger."}
{"text":"One of the best burger restaurants I have ever been to- and for an amazing price considering it is in Las Vegas! I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"ZI had high hopes as I like Bobby Flay recipes and shows.... unfortunately, it was only alright.
It's in a good location right on the strip attached to the Mandarin Hotel. The ambiance is pretty chill with a nice casual feel for a seat-yourself, order-at-counter restaurant.  I like the long communal sitting areas which work great for large groups. They also have smaller tables for smaller parties. 
The burger.... well, it was good but nothing spectacular.  I had the seasonal burger which had jalapeño dill and banana peppers. The wife ordered a bacon potato chip burger. We also ordered sweet potato fries and onion rings and a pineapple coconut rum and mocha kalua vodka milkshakes. 
The burger looked pretty sad for an $11 burger. The buns were heavily buttered, but it came across as greasy. The meat was delicious, but we thought it was too salty. I'm completely bummed I didn't take a photo. My bad. The sauces on the table really helped spice it up, but we kept referring how salty it was.
The shakes and sides were pretty good and the service was was great.... but the burgers just were alright, which is a bummer because we were hoping for something...epic I guess."}
{"text":"Had the Brunch burger, mint chocolate chip shake, & bacon cheese fries...Bobby deserves to be on the strip!  delish!"}
{"text":"Had the Bacon Blue burger with a top shelf margarita....excellent. Hubby had the brunch burger with a prickly pear margarita,  it too was excellent. The best...cheese and bacon froes...the BOMB!  We love Bobby's burgers!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge In n Out fan but this is objectively better. Salt plus fat equals burger bliss.  Bobby knows burgers period.  Tried Shake Shack for the first time as well but I can't understand how that place is packed but Bobby's always has space.  Tip: go crunchified.  Onion rings better than fries.  Pistachio shake plus whipped cream."}
{"text":"The food is delicious as one would expect from a restaurant named after Bobby Flay. I expected superior service also but after 2 visits that has not been the case on either one. In fact it has been just so so both times. 

The ordering process here is simply way too slow and needs to either be redesigned or a manager needs to step up and hire and train enough people to handle the volume of business that comes with the name. My guess is that there is some type of licensing arrangement because I can't imagine Bobby Flay being a part of anything so off the mark. 
Today, on a Saturday afternoon, they were out of Coke at the self serve fountain machine. That of itself shows poor management. When I pointed out the problem to a bartender after pouring and drinking the distasteful remains of the coke she told me they were out of Coke. And then did nothing to let customers know about the lack of this core beverage either at the fountain machine or the ordering counter. This clearly demonstrates a lack of interest in the guest's dining experience. I might expect this at a fast food burger joint but not at a high end palace like this. 
To be clear and fair, every employee was polite and friendly. The crunchburger and fries were so superb that I will no doubt be back to give it another try. It just feels like this is a ship without a captain bobbing around aimlessly, not a burger palace operated by a world renowned chef like Bobby Flay. 
UPDATE: I came back for the crunchburger and fries and was not disappointed as both were superb. The service was the same as on previous visits. They do have some nice workers and some of them seem to care. But it takes way to long to place and pay for an order, ridiculously slow process that could be fixed overnight. 
Today I saw something that I still have trouble believing or understanding. While I ate my meal the bartender also ate a meal, while on duty behind the bar, in plain site if everyone. This is very unprofessional and probably prohibited by health department regulations, plus just a little bit disgusting. Oh well, things like this don't seem to matter to the management of this establishment."}
{"text":"I was very excited about this place. Bobby Faly is one of my favorite chefs but he wasn't cooking tonight(joking,not that I was expecting that) .
I got a Baconcrunch burger. I requested it medium well and I got a very well done burger that it was too salty to taste nothing but the salt. The bun was dry and the bacon overcooked. For a $10.95 burger very disappointing. I will not come back to spend money here. The fact that has Bobby Flay on the front doesn't mean the food is good."}
{"text":"I had the Philadelphia burger with onion rings. The burger was good however the bun was a disappointment. It would have been better if the bun wasn't flimsy/soggy. It just didn't hold up to the meat, provolone , grilled onions & peppers. The pickle was huge and really good. The onion rings weren't all that great either."}
{"text":"Bobbys burger palace is probably my favorite burger place ever. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, and a homemade bun, the burger is an experience in itself. The shakes are creamy and delicious. I had the philly burger and loved it. The black and white Shake is my favorite, though the strawberry is a close second!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to burger joints! Always cooked perfect. Flavors on point. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Sadly, our first cuisine stop in Las Vegas was a bit of a disappointment.

While having two lines for eating in and take out is great.. if you are not manning the \"take-out\" line... you better have some kind of signage that points that out to people!

Starting off 5 minutes later.. we ordered, I went with the original crunch burger, and the girlfriend opted for a more \"spicy\" option of the Vegas burger (when in Rome right?)

We took our seat and enjoyed a bit of some great music, and the food arrived in a suitable amount of time.

Not incredibly impressive for what we paid (almost 30 dollars).. my burger was a lame little burger with plain potato chips on it. I know.. Bobby Flay tries to paint it as more.. but it's not much else. The giant pickle is the most impressive part of it.

The girlfriends was much of the same.. a pathetic little burger with a stack of BBQ chips on top... 

It was an interesting concept.. but really I feel like I could do it myself like that for much less, and might even taste better. My burger was just an unseasoned beef patty, and the chips just overpowered anything else with the amount of salt on them. Just meh.

My girlfriend, a couple of bites in.. started to complain about the heat of the burger (spiciness)... and took the Fresno red chilies.. which (and I love heat) were uncomfortably hot. It hurt somewhat to chomp them down for her.. but we did finish them off.

Overall just an over priced joint with average food. The one saving grace was the tunes playing."}
{"text":"I had the American with the chips and it was great. My wife had the Booby Bleu and also loved it. Service was great and price was reasonable for the location."}
{"text":"Have heard the hype surrounding this burger establishment and decided right place ans time so decided to try. I am so mad at myself for not trying on other of occasions, but I am fully educated now and its all good. Lesson learned.

Now lets move on to the food, after placing our order and sitting down at there fantastic little chairs that take me back to when I would visit a diner and eat with my parents. There lobby is so comfy with large green chairs the patron is seated at a counter and you can sit across from each other. 

Finally, the food as promised: I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was so juicy that it melted in my mouth. Writing this review makes my taste buds yearn for another. The burger evokes an emotional response it is so tasty and delicious. My twins ordered the chip burgers and the same dance happened with their meat in my mouth but just with lays chips in union. Also ordered a chocolate and strawberry shake. The chocolate shake was a dark chocolate and was better than the strawberry, it chocolate you know. Their fries and onion ring sampler are awesome as well. Now we all must go and satisfy our cravings for burgers."}
{"text":"Okay, I might be a little biased because I just love Bobby Flay with all my heart but I fell in love with this place.

Came here with my family and we all ordered different burgers and they were all delicious. I love how they were named after cities/states. 

You can choose how rare you want your patty and they actually serve it to you that way! I'm so used to having over done burgers. I prefer mine medium rare and I always get close to well done.

I order the Miami (pressed with ham, swiss, pickles, mayo, mustard) and it was the juiciest burger I've ever had.

They give you the half/half option when it comes to sides. But the portions for fries/etc are a bit small. There is also a variety of sauces on the table, all yum!

My sister ordered the pistachio milkshake, because we love pistachio anything, and it was great. Not overly sweet and just the right consistancy.

The decor was very modern and had that southwest tex mex feel that attains to Bobby's cooking style. Fast food feel, where you order up front, but they bring your food to you.

Good job Bobby Flay! This made me love you even more."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Their onion rings are the best so flavorful. Great shakes and loved the potato burger. If you are near here it's definitely worth a try. The service was also fast not much waiting and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"wow, a great burger joint that is affordable on the Strip.  My friend and I really enjoyed it.  The burgers were great and the fries and onion rings were too.   I needed to change my order soon after I ordered and sat down and they didn't mind at all.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious. Bobby's is located just outside the hotel I stayed at and was a great fast food option, especially in a place like Vegas where it seems like you're always pressed for time. I went there on 3 occasions during a 2 day stay and the burgers were so good that I ordered fries and didn't even eat it. I had the brunch burger and another one with blue cheese I can't recall. They were both good and filling. I'd definitely recommend this spot on those days when you're in a rush to catch that next party before the free entry ends."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the place and I had a good experience with Bobby's Burger Palace :)

They have great selection of burgers, sides, and drinks. Adding potato chips on top of your burger sounded fun but I didn't try it this time.

I ended up ordering the Bobby's Blue + Bacon burger with Sweet potato fries and Blueberry Pomegranate shake.

Burger was fresh and nicely cooked, fries were crisp and delicious, and wished they had large size option for the shake :-Q_____

I will revisit this store with my friends again to enjoy a decent burger and will definitely try adding the chips on my burger :)"}
{"text":"After attending a nearby Yelp event, a few yelpers decided it was time for a burger. I heard Bobby Flay, burgers and beer....I was sold! 

I was instantly impressed with the layout of this joint. The tables were in a semi \"S\" shaped style, which made for interesting dining. The tables were large and held about 10 people. The entire setup of the restaurant was fun and creative. No one walked away from our table a stranger. 

The line was long but went quickly. We waited less than 5 minutes from the time we walked in until the time we placed our order. I approached the cashier knowing exactly what I wanted. I was quick to order and to pay. 

The Bill: $22.16.....ehhh

The Brunch Burger - certified Angus beef, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I like my meat a little pink to keep the flavor so I ordered medium. The burger was nicely cooked but on your typical sesame seed bun. The egg and bacon was amazing, really who could argue with a fried egg and smoked bacon?? The burger was good but not the best burger I've ever had.  Not sure it was worth the $9.50, but I knew walking in I was paying for the name behind the burger. 

The Half and Half - you can order one side for $4 each or combine 2 sides for $5. You have the option to get french fries, sweet potato fries or beer battered onion rings. I decided to go for the the regular fries, with the all amazing BBP Fry Sauce and the Beer Battered Onion Rings. The fries were tasty, crisp and all around the perfect fries. No complaints. I was a little disappointed to only see 2 onion rings come with the half and half. I mean really, those rings were perfect and you're going to tease me with only 2? 

Beer - Miller Lite. Yes, BBP has its own decent selection of beers, drinks, wines spiked milkshakes and margaritas, I stuck to my roots and went with a Miller Lite. After all, they didn't have PBR. 

Overall, the food was good but nothing about it stood out to make my mouth water as I write my review. The staff checked on us regularly and even made sure we all had beers when we were getting low. Just because of the experience, friendliness of the staff and my urge to try more burgers on the menu, I will probably return."}
{"text":"Great experience. Food, service, atmosphere. Gladly spent $75.00 for a memorable fun time. Wife, kids enjoyed it all. Must go to place when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am a hugh BF fan but I was not impressed with my burger.  I was however a impressed with my milk shake and my sweet potato fries.  Like the other famous celebrity chef places on the strip - a little pricey."}
{"text":"Love Bobby's Burger Palace. The first time I went was in Philadelphia and I thought at the time it was the best burger I had ever eaten. With that memory in mind, I had to check out BBP in Vegas. The beef is pretty high quality and I still felt that the burger itself was amazing. I had the Blue Cheese burger, which I highly recommend. However, I was disappointed with the fries that I ordered with the burger - they were a bit burnt. Thinking back, I should have sent them back, but I think the goodness of the burger experience overpowered the discontent I had with the fries. Overall, this is a great place to go if looking for a great burger. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Short version: overpriced, mediocre burger, fries and 2 onion rings, and a really bad malt.  Such a disappointment considering it is Bobby Flay's restaurant.  Long version: Not impressed!  Everything is ala carte.  The cheapest burger is $8.50. This is the cheeseburger with lays potato chips on it.  I had that and added lettuce (no extra charge).  I ordered the mixed regular fries and onion rings $5 ($1 extra), black and white malt with double malt $6.50(no extra), a soda $2.50.  My husband got the regular cheese burger $9.50 (go figure, it was $1 more than the chip burger).  It was supposed to have lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle.  First the malt came out.  It looked like chocolate milk with some ice crystals in it.  I flagged down the girl that took our order (she was cleaning tables in her down time from taking orders).  I asked her if that is how the malt was supposed to look.  She frowned at it and said \"no\" and said she knew what I was looking for and would make sure it was right. She took it and came back little later with another one that was slightly thicker, but still far too running to call a malt.  So I explained how thick I thought the malt would be and she agreed and said it was the double malt that was causing the problem.  She brought another.  It was a little thicker, but more of a thin shake than a malt.  I gave up and just kept it.  Then my burger, fries, and 2 onion rings (yes I said 2 onion rings) cames out (my husband's did not).  Maybe 5-7 mins later, his burger came.  They brought him the same chip burger that they brought me!  At this point, we weren't sending it back.  The burgers didn't have condiments on them and it didn't taste like they had any seasoning on them.  On the table is there their signature burger sauce, Chipotle ketchup, mustard, and regular ketchup.  The burger sauce was EXTREMELY salty and the Chipotle ketchup was vinegary (I know, I just made that word up).  I didn't like the fries, but my husband said they were ok. The 2 onion rings were good. I expected soooo much more from a place bearing Bobby Flay's name.  It was just a burger and just some fries, oh and 2 onion rings, and a really bad malt.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Is this the best burger I've ever had? No, but it is pretty close and priced significantly lower ;)

The Burger itself was a real treat with a very good bun. Some burger places actually forget, that it's not all about the meat and fancy sauces.

The menu itself is very simple, with only a few choices, but that is more than enough. This also makes it harder to find something you don't like."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Too much salt.

Ordered a couple different burgers to see what the fuss was all about.

The Brunch burger was missing some type of breakfast potatoes on it, not to worry... I \"Crunchified\" that shit! There is an option (free) where you can get potato chips crumbled all over any burger you order. Groundbreaking culinary stuff right there. The burger, although salty as fuck, had a pink middle and a bit of a char for a properly cooked medium slab of meat. 

The American burger was the same thing minus all of the flair. Salty. Just another hunk of meat between some bread for $10 bucks.

The fries were okay but a little, you guessed it, salty.

No wonder Bobby Flay is always losing on his show. Cut some of the salt out and drop the price (these are not special burgers) and BBP might be able to compete with already over-priced burger joint chains in the area who offer a better product."}
{"text":"Omg . My husband and I go to the one back at home in jersey and it's bomb and so was this one !!! I'm not even a meat person period but when I'm craving a burger I def come here they never disappoint me ! I had the Mexico burger  and my husband had the Texas BBQ one LOL both delicious!!! Give this place a try !!"}
{"text":"I had the Cheyenne Burger with bacon, BBQ sauce, and onion rings.  Delicious!  Perfectly flavored and cooked just right.  The juice was dipping down my fingers and the sesame bun had the right texture for me.  The sauce had a bit of heat and the bacon was cooked the way I like, so I had no complaints all around.

My son had the bacon burger with potato chips and loved it even more than I enjoyed mine.  He said that he would definitely want to eat here again.

I had a $16 burger at Gordon Ramsay Burger last night, and this one was every bit as good for $10."}
{"text":"We love burgers, so had to try a Bobby Flay restaurant.  The dark chocolate milkshake was awesome, but at $6.50, a bit pricey.  I had the classic burger and my husband had the Philadelphia.   The burgers were fine, but nothing special.  Loads and loads of sesame seeds on the bun, thick burger and a nice array of sauces you could try.   The Philadelphia had HOT peppers that were hot.  We also got the split order of fries and sweet potato fries.   They weren't very hot, so again, nothing special.

So for $40 we got burgers, fries and shakes.   I think Five Guys are better as they are juicy, their fries are always hot and it's not as expensive.

I think Bobby needs to change things up as there were hardly any customers, unlike every other restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and hit the spot. Real easy to order and price was right. Cool seating too. Could be a little cleaner but tons of people move through there right off the strip. Burger was cooked perfect and daily special was exceptional. Definitely a return is in order."}
{"text":"After trying some decidedly bad celebrity chef places this trip my bf announced that we would not be eating at a celebrity chef restaurant if their prices were comparable to olive garden. Affordable prices meant tourist trap with crap food. (such a little food snob I turned him into ;) this was a pleasant surprise and didn't conform to the other subpar food celebrity chefs are sticking their name to. 

Got the dallas. Good but the sauce was a little over powering. Getting it crunchified was brilliant. Next we got Miami which was my favorite. Over salted but after scraping a little seasoning off it too was pretty good. Huge amount of fries in their combo of regular and sweet potato fries. And the fry sauce was amazing!! Super fatty and not something I would normally use but I pretty much drenched everything in it. 

The prices are really decent (again why i wasnt expecting much...see tip on Buddy V's tourist trap at the Venetian that tastes worse than Buca's) I'll definitely come back. I think I even like it better than Holstein's next door (which by the way totally cheaps out on the liquor in the shakes now)  so I'll be getting the spiked shakes here next time too!"}
{"text":"This place gets a thumbs up for the open kitchen concept. I'm a fan of watching my food cook. We are visiting the burger joint around noon on a Saturday, about half the tables filled; yet, despite five people in black shirts serving, food service is a complete disaster. With runners shouting to each other \"where's table 6?!\" you would think they would come up with a better idea to number tables/orders than a tiny red plastic placard. Oh, and it's been about 20 minutes... still no burger.

Update: just found out my burger was served to another table. Awesome. Walking out."}
{"text":"Wish I could do 3.5 stars.  Very solid burger spot.  Don't expect a fancy place, seems to be more in the mold of In-n-Out style.  Everything tasted great and reasonably prices.  The shake was my favorite part of the meal.  The potato chips on the burger are a nice touch."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Came here instead of Shake Shack since my last experience wasn't good in DC.

Bobby's is located on the strip between Aria and Monte Carlo and was walking distance of my hotel.  It was a Friday evening and placing my order and finding a seat was done with ease.

The friendly female staff at the counter entered my order - brunch burger ( beef, egg, applewood bacon, and cheese), mix of sweet potato fries & onion rings and pistachio shake. My order arrived promptly - the burger was cooked to my request of medium and was juicy and yummy tasting. The rings & fries were solid tasting and the pistachio shake was on the small size but tasted superb.

Move over Gordon Ramsey and Shake Shack, I preferred Bobby's Flays Burger Palace!"}
{"text":"Quick Casual Restaurant. Why bother with Gordon Ramsey's BurGR when you can have a FANTABULOUS burger, wine or margarita to boot at Bobby's Burger Palace and sit outside and bask in the Las Vegas sun!  The burger choice is expansive but not overwhelming. The burgers are cooked to order and the combination of flavors is outstanding. Add to that that it is relatively affordable and won't bust your wallet. What a terrific dining experience! I'm Lovin' Bobby Flay right now!"}
{"text":"We went close to closing time. They took about 20 minutes to bring out our food. My husband ordered a burger and I got a salad. He liked his burger. One of the main ingredients in my sald was supposed to be avocado and I noticed they didn't put any in. When I told the waitress about it she said they were out of avocado and seemed unconcerned. I pointed out that they should have told me that when I ordered since it was a main ingredient of the salad. She then blamed her co-worker for not telling us they ran out. She did offer to get me something else instead but at that point it had been a half hour since I ordered and they were about to close so I just ate it as it was. It was pretty unimpressive without the central ingredient though."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm really between a 3 and 4 star.  I was waking down the strip toward shake shake when I saw this place.  Hmmm Bobby Flay I'll give you a try.  I go in and the place wasn't busy at all at lunch time.  I wonder if many do the strips restaurants are slow during the weekday?  I and made my decision am I'm ready to order but the cashier was like hold on while she finishes her text on the phone...okayyy?  When her fingers stopped I ordered the Dallas burger, fries and a drink and was given a number to place where I sit.  It's self service drink so I get a ginger ale.  The fries came out about a minute after I sat down.  I wish it came out with the burger as I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for that.   

The burger was the star of this show.  Although I ordered mid well, the burger still came out juicy.  All the toppings and the sauce came together really well.  It remind me of a burger you would make in your back yard.  (Opposite of what I had at Gordon Ramsay BurGR).  Negatives?  It needed a pinch more salt and it was on the small side.  

The fries on the other hand were terrible.  1/2 the fries were old and grease filled.  They were most likely reheated old fries.  

So would I return?  Maybe if a friend wanted to try.  But if it were just me, there are many other burger places to try in Vegas.  Sorry Bobby, you lost this showdown."}
{"text":"Great burger and of course I had the Carolina burger since I was visiting from NC!  This is more on the fast food side where you order at the counter and they bring your food but the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Chipotle ketchup was very good. For a little more than Johnny Rockets you get real food. Good spot to get a \"cheap\" burger fix on the Strip."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I like Bobby Flay's style, but this was a let down. Before you venture here, know it is a fast food joint. You order at the counter and you get a number for your spot (I'd say table, but it is mostly communal style counters. 

The counters and stools were filthy, dried sauces were crusted to everything. I really don't like having to clean before I can sit. 

The food was decent. I had the brunch burger. It was a good burger. The bacon and egg combo worked well. The fries were a little overdone. The burger of the month was the Napa burger. Good flavor combination. If you like goat cheese, you will enjoy this burger.

I got the lemonade, you get a tiny cup and free refills, but you have to find someone to fill it for you. Mildly awkward when it is slow in there, I can't imagine what it would be like when it is busy.

I'm glad I tried it, but I doubt I'll be back. I'd rather spend my time at one of Bobby Flay's other restaurants."}
{"text":"Ate here on a recent business trip. It was late and they were cleaning up for the night but they still served me and a coworker with a smile and we received our food promptly. It was quite good and I will definitely earmark it for a future visit when I am back in Vegas. I had just a standard cheeseburger but it was the right amount of juicy without being greasy. I recommend a stop if you have the chance."}
{"text":"The burgers were yummy and the fries were to die for; but my mocha-caramel shake was sickeningly sweet and bizarrely textured. It tasted as if they'd substituted straight caramel sauce for the milk. Overall, this is a perfectly decent place to grab lunch on the strip. Good taste at a great price- just skip the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Cooked to perfection. Service was quick and friendly. The environment is not too loud or too quiet; it's just right. Also liked how the server told me that if I need anything, I just let him know. Will come back whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. Their brunch burger with the melted egg looked sooooo good! The staff was friendly the place was clean. The burger however was way too salty. Just didn't work. Bacon adds salt but the seasoning on the burger must have just made it too salty for this one."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon crunch burger, onion rings and fries. I asked for the burger Medium and it was perfectly juicy! The burger had good flavor and had potato chips that added crunch and gave it that little something special. The onion rings were really crunchy with not too much breading, and the fries you can tell are cooked with lots of attention."}
{"text":"The burger r so delicious! super friendly service!! Didn't like the avocado, it comes too cold for a hot burger. Enjooooy"}
{"text":"Crunchified, Crunchified, Crunchified!!  I have been to the Las Vegas, NJ, and Connecticut locations, all has been consistently good!  One of my favorite places to get a great damn Burger!"}
{"text":"Bobby nailed it! Excellent food at reasonable price, you gotta get the undecided appetizer, fries and rings, two sauces, both excellent.  I got The New Mexico burger cooked perfectly.  Great value!"}
{"text":"This burger was terrible.  I was hoping the name would help out, but sadly the burger had a very gross, chemical flavor.  Blech!"}
{"text":"It's pretty delicious. It's a walk up and order kind of place which isn't my favorite when paying semi high prices for food, but it was yummy."}
{"text":"As everyone else who has recently reviewed this place I'm surprised at the other low reviews. This place isn't that bad. The only suggestion I have is make a change on the bread too many sesame seeds, like all over it top bun and bottom! Tried three of the sauces they places on the table jalapeño hot sauce bbq ketchup was my fav, and the burger sauce. Ordered onion rings, which were decent,  and the burger of the month, Pacific Northwest burger, wish I had a picture but I was too hungry to take a picture. May come again next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place on the strip and we go there every time we visit vegas now. These are amazing burgers. I always get the Bobby blu burger. Perfect amount of blue cheese, super yummy white cheese, really good bacon, the bun is awesome. My husband always gets the brunch burger. The egg is always done perfectly, the meat is amazing, and the bacon is nice and thick. The onion rings and fries are really good and you get a good amount. We will always go back to Bobby's."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed that my guy B-Flay himself wasn't there to prepare my burger in front of me, but I suppose that might be high expectations for a ten dollar burger. 

The burger however was freaking dynamite. I had the Santa Fe and it was a mouth party. The queso sauce on there was delicious, and I paired it with the jalapeño green sauce and the burger sauce for a nice kick in the mouth. The green hatch chiles were a delicious addition, but most importantly the meat itself was a real treat. Well cooked with a nice crisp on the outside, and perfectly juicy inside. The sauce that came with the fries was amaze-balls as well."}
{"text":"Very solid taste. Easy to eat, flavor is great, staff was good. On top of the customer service. Good spot."}
{"text":"Me and my wife ate there earlier today on our honeymoon in Vegas the burgers were pretty good, decent selections of beer a bit overpriced but you can expect that on the strip but overall I give it a four star rating"}
{"text":"Best blue burger I have ever had! Would go back anytime. The sauces are great and the customer service is good!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met here for lunch.  I was nursing a hangover and thought a burger would do the trick. 

On entry, the colors and bar-counter & stools and booths make it more like a fast food place than a restaurant.  We sat down first and staff told us to go to the front and order and they would bring us our food.  

I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger.  It had Angus Beef, Blue Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato, cooked Medium Rare.  Growing up in the midwest, I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers and this was a good burger.  I thought I would eat only half and ended up eating the whole thing.  I did not try the fries nor did I get chips added to the burger.  I drank a water to hydrate, while eating my burger.  However, while I was ordering my burger I noticed they had Spike Milkshakes.  I had asked the clerk, which spike shake was the most popular and her response was the Vanilla Caramel Bourbon.  

As I was finishing my burger, a staff member asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered the Spike Pineapple Coconut Rum Milkshake without whipped cream.  (I thought it was funny that I could order and pay for shake while seated, but when I first walked in, I had to go to front register to order and pay for my burger).  The shake was thick and sweet (I could barely taste the booze), but there was no way I was going to finish it.

While sitting there, 2 other friends walked in.  Because the seating style has stools on both sides of the bar, our friends could sit across from us to chit chat.  Nice.

Finally, as I was leaving, I was planning to leave the shake there when a staff member asked if I wanted to have my shake placed in a to go cup.  Yes!  Glad they offered and I could take it back to my room."}
{"text":"I would go with a 3.5 rating. I go here every time I am in Las Vegas. On my liquor milkshake either they are short pouring now or the whip cream on top melts before they get it to your table. Either way, minus points.

It was just a bit off this visit."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised at the quality of beef patties they had here. Even with ordering a medium well, almost no pink in the middle, the patty was soft and moist. The bun didn't look exciting either but it actually tasted great. I really enjoyed the Bobby Blue burger. Blue cheese can be hit or miss and BBP definitely is ordering from the right vendor. I enjoyed the Chipotle ketchup and jalapeño sauce. The burger sauce tasted like a steak sauce. Sweet potato fries were great too.

Do not get the Cactus Pear margarita. I looked great but tasted bitter."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious burger! I was very surprised and unsure of this place walking by. It looked like a fast food joint but I know Bobby Flay is known for his burgers and I wanted a solid lunch without paying an arm and leg on the strip. I'm so glad we stopped here!

Our burgers were cooked to order and so moist and flavorful! The fries and onion rings are tasty and you have to be careful not to eat excessive amounts because they go down so easy plus your portion is huge. I was absolutely stuffed when we left but so satisfied. 

You can seat yourself, it's bright, open and was very clean when we dined there. It's around $15 per person but so worth it. Oh, and do yourself a favor and try their alcohol infused milkshakes! The vanilla caramel bourbon one was delicious - I kept stealing sips of my husband's."}
{"text":"If you love burgers and enjoy the option of choosing how it is cooked (medium rare, well...), you'll want to make a stop over here. Adults looking for a sweet and alcoholic treat, try the adult shakes. I highly recommend the Kahlua-Mocha Vodka shake. Overall, these menu items are delicious but tastes very similar to Red Robin burgers."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 for the milkshake, chocolate as malt as can be.  Wished I had the room for a burger but after Aria Cafe, I was done.  

Indeed smooth, and Mr. Flay should open one up in Van, not to mention we need more celebrity chef restaurants.  

Rent here is $65,000 US a month!  Don't ask how I found out lol.   But obviously does great number facing the strip.  

Like the marketing colours here, a bit of a throwback. 

Cool wavy seating.  

Good service.  

For $7, good deal.  Not as sweet or malty.  Whipped cream is an option."}
{"text":"RUN FOREST - RUN !!!   This place was horrible.   Decided to take a chance on this place while walking the Vegas Strip.   So you'd think  that if Bobby is going to slap his celebrity name on it, that the food would be great --- ha, far from it.   The two $9.00 burgers the wife and I order were pathetically small --- AND COLD !!!   Did I say cold?  Yep --- bodies at mortuaries have more have more heat than these burgers.   And the fries and onion rings that we each ordered --- yep, you guessed it --- COLD, COLD, COLD.    

And COLD, COLD, COLD is what you get when you try to complain via good ole' Bobby's corporate website.   Not only do they have NO electronic method to send your comments, but they insist you write them a letter.   So basically, the COLDNESS starts at the top and funnels it's way down to the locations.  

Save your hard earned $$$ folks while in Vegas, and find a place that serves good food.   There are sooooo many others to chose from.   And judging by the many, many, many other low ratings, this place will not be around much longer.   Besides, the corporation behind this place could care less if  you get value or not.   Remember, then really don't even want to hear your comments........"}
{"text":"Liked everything about this place!  Food, execution, ambiance and location!

First it's very easy to find on the strip next to the Aria hotel. (Best hotel ever)  You can order online if you're in a rush, there always seems to be open seats due to the unique seating layout. And the food, hey, it's Bobby Flay's joint.  No need to even ask if he's using quality ingredients.  What was kind of a surprise was how well executed the rest of the restaurant concept was.

First, every customer is greeted by a friendly energetic face.  Options are well explained and after you order you're given a number to place on the table and when your food is ready it's brought out to you.  So, lots of places do this, but Bobby takes it a step further.  You can view the open kitchen which is always a good sign of a quality restaurant.  Another cool perk was that every order that comes out of the kitchen and placed on the oversized service window ledge can be viewed easily.  Cool way to see what others are getting, gave me ideas for next time actually. To my surprise almost everyone is getting chips on their burger, not just me!  Thought I was being a little daring but in Bob we trust.  Bobby says chips go on burgers then only thing I could say is hook me up with a crunch burger now!

The hamburger was delicious and quite unique.  More specifically it resembled a steak in flavor more than just a regular a burger.  First you have to squish down that top bun then open wide and ...to borrow a colloquialism from Emiril...BAM!!  You just had a bite of best burger in Vegas!!  Fries were excellent too and the food is made fresh to order which takes a few more minutes than the Ronald McMoney scene but it's worth every second and remember ...you can always order ahead!

Looking good Bobby!  5 well earned stars!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, burgers themselves are excellent. Toppings and buns slightly above average. We had the Blue burger and Philly. Onion rings were very good but barely warm when we got them. Chopped salad was quite good. We sat at the bar and service was friendly and fast. Margaritas were surprisingly good and not made from a mix. Overall a solid meal, but not memorable."}
{"text":"You have to take BBP for what it is.  And in my opinion it is an upscale, fast casual burger eatery. That being said, I was very impressed with the quality of food and service at BBP. You can tell that everything is made from scratch and all of the flavor profiles are spot on. It's also refreshing to have a rare or medium-rare burger in a fast food type setting. The fries were obviously fresh made and were much better than In-N-Out fries because they are cut thicker, therefore offering better potato flavor. Yes the prices are a bit steep for \"fast food\" but if you understand that you get what you pay for, I'd say it was a worthy treat."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE! The food is okay, nothing special in terms of taste, but I got food poisoning from the Philly Burger I ate. I've eaten at one of Bobby's restaurants in Vegas before and as much as I dislike Bobby Flays personality, the food was good. This is not the case at Burger Palace, my burger was mediocre, the hot peppers it came with were not hot and tasted a bit sour. Worst of all this food made me sick, spent the night vomiting and it's been 2 days and I still have an upset stomach!"}
{"text":"Great burger. I was hoping for a nicer atmosphere but it was fine for a casual lunch. The restaurant has a diner feel. Order up front and find a seat and it's delivered.  Burgers were a nice size and very flavorful. Buns were average. Cheese fries were good although it seemed like highly processed cheese.  We had a hard time finding this place, no one around has addresses posted.  I would go again. Loved the potato chips on the burger- free on any burger!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, well because, it's Bobby Flay and Mesa Grill was good. 

Ordered the green chili cheeseburger, medium, and it came well done. They sent another burger out because I asked but it wasn't medium, whatever, I ate it. It was decent, I've had better burgers on Livermore. 

Moderately priced and the onion rings were legit AF. 

The bartender lady was the saving grace of the establishment. Bobby Flay, smh!"}
{"text":"Bobby knows burgers! I'm basing my review off of what my husband ate because I didn't eat anything here. He had a turkey burger. I did have a bite and it was fresh and seasoned well. Mr. Flat sure knows how to put a burger together. It seemed slow at first but by the time we left 5-6 people seemed to roll I. And sat down. You can get carry out so if you're staying at the Aria, this us a good option."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burger here, fresh, flavorful and a little different. The shake, OMG, vanilla was truly vanilla with actual vanilla in it, not the artificial crap....got onion rings, not my fav but the server who brought my food explained the different sauces at the table...
I think I'll be back for another go, it was much better than other burger places in Vegas I've tried."}
{"text":"Burberry was great and juicy.  Not every organized when it comes service, ordering or cleanliness.  For such a great famous chef to have a disorganized place is disappointing."}
{"text":"Umm my burger was too salty and peppery, and so was my coworker's. It was a fail and the most disappointing Vegas meal during my trip. Maybe an off day? Service was good though."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had, period.

Gourmet burgers, a wide variety of gourmet toppings representing different U.S. cities... A must try if you love burgers. Or if you just love food in general. Go!"}
{"text":"First of all I'm from New Mexico and I had the New Mexico Burger (medium well), it lives up to its name. The roasted green chile's tasted as if they came from my state. It was cooked to perfection.  Also had a vanilla bean milkshake with real whipped cream and I would strongly suggest getting one when you come in. Also make sure to bring your appetite very large portions and the different sauces at the tables are all worth trying. 5 stars based off the food alone."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful employees, clean place on the strip, great for kids and it's a Delish $9-$10 gourmet burger! Get yours topped with chips-you won't regret it. We ordered the sweet potato fries and I wish he sold the mustard horseradish sauce-I licked the bowl clean. Easy, fun and somewhat affordable walk up burger joint on the strip- with beer and margs!"}
{"text":"Bobby Flay was never my favorite celebri-chef, though I always respected how good a loser he was on Throwdown and the not-good Iron Chef (aka Iron Chef America). You may laugh, but on Throwdown he was not only going up against people who were the best at what they do, he was always playing \"away games\" on THEIR turf - he had his work cut out for him and did a respectable job considering, and was never a sore loser or a dick to people. That said, I never liked him as much as Gordon Ramsay, who made his name out of being a dick to people.

But Gordon spoiled my illusion of his mad chef cred with his shite burger joint at the PH. Despite being a fast casual rather than a gourmet sit-down restaurant, Bobby's place blows BURGR out of the water. After the fiasco that was BURGR we almost didn't come here, but I'm glad we took the chance as it was right outside our hotel (the venerable Mandarin Oriental -- racist name, plush hotel).

The LA burger was decent - it was no Lucky Devil's American Kobe burger with crack sauce and crack bun, but it blew away the Gordon Burg(e)r o' Shame, and was cheaper to boot. It was a bit messy because it did not skimp on avocado. I ordered it rare and it was actually served rare! (This should not be that hard to find but sadly most places can't cook a rare burger, even if they say that they do. I'm not going to sue you, so unclench. Srsly.) They even offered to cut the burger in half for us to share, and gave us the potato chips on the side.

Cons: the burger was a bit on the small side, the bun was kind of McDonald-y, and the tomato was the sad pale bullet-proof kind.

I wasn't a fan of any of the sauces, but it didn't matter because neither the burger nor the fries needed it. The regular fries were surprisingly good, and I was pleasantly surprised that the sweet potato fries were not \"enhanced\" with extra sweetener like powdered sugar.

The dark chocolate milk shake was surprisingly not too sweet. The whipped cream was fresh, though a tad too sweet, but was perhaps a good balance with the dark chocolate, less sweet than regular chocolate by nature.

3.5 stars for food (A-OK+), 5 stars for service.

It was weird that you could only see partially into the kitchen - I spent the whole time watching a bunch of burly chests go back and forth... Not that this was necessarily a bad thing, mind you! One of the chefs complimented my husband's Unabomber beard - of course this from a man with his very own spectacular mountain man face muff.

I feel like the logo may purposely evoke the classic Burger Time video game. I also feel it maybe should have just been called Bobby's Burgers and had pun-ny names for the different burgers like the cartoon -- \"The Bobby Flayed Alive Burger: comes with pork cracklins.\" :D

I didn't see any of the problems with service or cleanliness other Yelpers mentioned. Surprisingly no tip line on the check, even though there was partial table service (just not full service). Too bad, I was so impressed I wanted to tip them 50%, especially after the horrible service at the full service BURGR."}
{"text":"First time at Bobby's Burgers palace and this  burger joint had great burgers and great service!!  Alex served us and he was so friendly.. The place got busy and he didn't miss a beat in making sure we had everything we needed at all times..It is so nice to know that there is impeccable  service still in Vegas along with affordable prices!!"}
{"text":"I've spent my whole life looking for the perfect burger... and I found it. This place really captures the taste of a delicious burger and makes you feel like it was made in your own backyard. Delicious!! I recommend the nacho burger, and a just the normal hamburger. You can always add the sauces available in the seating area that are delicious as well.  Bobby is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered la burger with sweet potato friends. Both are good. Food medium meet and perfect fries ."}
{"text":"I finally tried Bobby's Burger Palace for dinner. No lines to order my food and the cashier was very friendly and chatty.   I was surprise the prices are reasonable under $10 for a burger and fries prices are $4-5.  I had the new mexico burger and cheese fries.  The burger was very juicy and small in size like shack shake burger.  The cheese fries is tasty and not too crunchy with white cheese $4.50.  The staff are very friendly and offer suggestions which sauce to use on my burger and providing silverware.  There are mostly counter feel shaped in a S shaped or rectangle counters like a communal feel.  They also sell milkshakes and beer along with soda.  I would come back again. Next time I would try the onion rings. I seen the onion rings at other tables and they look huge and delicious."}
{"text":"Oh Bobby Flay! I heard you mentor and knock down people's food on Food Network Star every Sunday but someone needs to re-up your burgers.

I was thoroughly disappointed in the burgers. They had cool options and cool names but the taste was not up to par with how you expect Bobby Burger King's food to be. His recipes need some help. 

I got the Brunch burger which was pretty basic even with the egg. The fries were ok.. definitely heavy with the cheese and bacon. I'd get that again. 

Sadly there are tons of other burgers options on the strip that I would go to before coming back here. 

I'm still a Fan Bobby!"}
{"text":"Again, fantastic service at the bar during happy hour at this much less formal establishment. Since I cannot eat a burger at every joint on the strip, I had a salad, but burgers do look great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.   The Dallas burger was a perfect balance of sauce and spice.   Onion rings and sweet potatoes frys good.   Also never a disappointment with the sauces offered.  And a big bonus for Bobbys burger place is the military discount,  thank you for that. 

The only negative thing I did not like was employee's eating at the same tables and then immediately stayed serving food with out washing there hands.   Unless you can walk behind the swinging wash and be back in a matter of seconds."}
{"text":"Strolled into this gem today and so glad we did! Burgers are delicious, fries are delicious, onion rings are delicious. It was just... What's the word...Delicious!! 

I got the Philly Burger. Yummy yummy! Has a kick of heat but, fine by me! The cheese fries with bacon were yummy also! 

Definitely recommend! Service was amazing also!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Crunch Burger. I've eaten burgers all over town and have to say, this is one of the better ones. Cooked medium is exactly what I got. Juicy and full of flavor. I would say they used at least a 7oz patty. For under $10 bucks you really are getting good value for your money. Hand cut fries as well which I always appreciate. Huge amount and a small was more than enough. Plenty of dipping sauces which I always love. 
Parking- Use Valet at the Mandarin Orient for easy access. It's right out the back door and I wish I would of known that before I made the trek. Other than that you're on foot to get to this location. Stayed at the Cosmopolitan so I had a 20 minute walk, up and down pedestrian bridges. Not the fun nest walk when full and in a food coma. Lol.. Also, I spoke to the waitress who says she parks at Aria for close walk."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the lady at the front counter. She was very polite.

Place was not busy and it was slow and filthy. Restrooms had a code to enter you get by being a customer but it's not like that lock code helped keep them clean. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a week. 

The burger itself wasn't seasoned and the fries seemed like they were probably old and just re-fried for us. 

So disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I will drive an 8 hour turn around trip just for this place.. he loves his burgers rare, and BBP delivers that to perfection. I love the onion rings! So so peppery and delicious."}
{"text":"burger very good  fries pretty good onion rings too greasy vanilla shake good but too small for the $$$$  ..........would go back for burger anytime!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the mix of fries, which came with two sauces. The yellow horseradish sauce that comes with the sweet potato fries was excellent. The fries were standard.

My husband had the Philly burger, which he enjoyed. I had the Dallas burger. I don't know if it was the spice on the burger or the BBQ sauce, but it was one of the worst tasting burgers I have ever had. I was very disappointed. 

My blueberry-pomegranate shake was very good, but also very small.  My husband got the pineapple coconut without the rum, which he also enjoyed.

Service was strange. They brought the fries. A few minutes later, they brought my burger. A couple more minutes, they brought my husband's burger. Then a few minutes later, our milk shakes. Service was friendly, but $40 for this meal was absolutely not worth it. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! Good crisp fries, juicy well done burger, excellent customer service and I love the set up. Four star worthy burger joint."}
{"text":"Great burger as usual!  Don't skip the fries.  Service was quick and friendly. There is something here for everyone. The Vegas location has spiked milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas for a conference and needed a place to eat by myself. This place was perfect for my situation. The restaurant is not intimidating and I didn't feel like a loser eating by myself. 
The fellow at the front said that the \"crunchified\" Brunch Burger was his favorite, so I gave that a go. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I also ordered the half and half fries and onion rings. The fries were among the best I've had. The onion rings were nice and tender. I burned through a lot of napkins on this one, but it was worth it.
I wasn't a fan of the fry sauce our the other sauces on the table, for that matter, but the food didn't really need it.
I don't think I'll have ongoing cravings to come back, but I will eat here again the next time I'm in this area and need something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"I got the veggie burger and it was SOOOO dry and stale. No flavor and it was even hard to imagine eating it. If you are a vegetarian you are better off finding another spot on the strip."}
{"text":"i had had the burger salad....it was good. I usually think protein burgers leave something to be desired, but this one was just right! fries were great! mint/chocolate chip shake was amazing! Just a bit too expensive! 2 burgers, one grilled cheese, one soda and one shake for about $45! hence the 4 points."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were a little too high for it being a Bobby Flay joint. It's basically a Smash Burger with a twist.  Nothing wrong with the food, great price for where it is, too.  The bathroom was dark dingy and out of soap... My son was disappointed he ordered avocado with his burger but got guac and when we told them they said they don't have avocados! Overall, it was ok. Satisfied our burger cravings"}
{"text":"WOW!  this place is incredible!  The food is AMAZING!  Great friendly staff  The milk shake is a must"}
{"text":"You would think with a big name like Bobby Flay attached to this place, and more importantly a prime location in one of the most upscale spots in front of The Mandarin, Aria and VEEER, the burgers would be off the charts.  Not the case.  

While the menu is creative in combination of options appealing to many different tastes, the actual burgers are not cooked to the standards one would expect from Flay.   Ordered a medium rare, and the temperature was bordering on medium / well.  It does appear they cook to order, but hard to imagine they haven't mastered the combination of grill and high oven finish to hold in flavor and moisture.  Buns were dry and \"blah\".  With a thick burger the last thing you want is hard dry bun -- makes it impossible to eat and get a full bit of the burger.  We also tried the turkey burger - stay away from that. 

The counter order concept and service was great, but hearing folks sitting next to us also commenting on how plain and dry the burgers were confirmed Bobby needs to spend a little more time in this kitchen if he wants to protect his brand from ending up in a supermarket chain frozen section.  Several other celebrity chef burger places in Vegas have way exceeded this place.  It is still new, so we could attribute this to the \"teething process.\"  But it won't be here long enough if it keeps cooking these kinds of burger, even if the prices are very good compared to the competition."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good burgers and I had the bacon cheese fries  soooo yummi 

Just the washrooms are a bit complicated because they have a code so you need to ask for the code, but aside of that everything was so good fast service, good price, yummi burgers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were walking the strip and hit the hangry point and needed to rest and eat even though we were not super hungry from the heat. I spotted Bobby's place which was a mix between fast food and restaurant. You order your food like a normal fast food joint, but is cooked to serve. There are only ten burgers, four sides, and salads to choose from. I was really pleased because it was the right mix of quick and sit down to relax. Plus the burger I got which was the Miami and My wife got the Dallas are versions of a Cuban and pulled pork burgers. Excellent with great sauces. One of top two or three burgers I have had. Would eat it again if we had one of his places closer. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Aria, jet lagged, looking for a quick dinner, and not willing to pay for room service. Bobby's Burger Palace fit the bill. The burger was good and juicy. The fries were not as crispy as I'd have liked, but overall it was a good, quick meal."}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is upscale fast food spot that serves beer. Which happened to be exactly what we were looking for a quick recharge after a morning at the pool. The kitchen churns out interesting burgers with great taste in record speed.  Tried the Dallas and the Vegas. Both sandwiches were tasty and worthy of sinking your teeth into. 

Unsung hero of our stop-in was definitely the fries - hot crispy and perfectly salted. 

If you sit down, make sure you try the Jalepeno sauce - sweet spicy and definitely unique."}
{"text":"Pretty darned good!
Went for a walk on the strip specifically to head out to dinner. Stumbled on this place. Good location, good price point, and delicious! 
Got the Crunchy Burger with potato chips - super fun! They not only cook to order, but don't mind your ordering a rare or medium rare burger!

Also got a Bourbon Milkshakes, I highly recommend that too!"}
{"text":"Had very big expectations for this place, the only thing lacking was the people NOT eating here to complete the environment. There was only us and two other people when we got there. The decor is awesome, makes it feel very modern with an old 50's burger joint twist. The burgers were extremely juicy for being medium well and the flavors were great! We got the Las Vegas (which has BBQ chips inside of it) and the New Mexico (Which had red serrano peppers.....amazing). The onion rings were super HUGE.... You get four, but I don't really like how you have to eat them. All in all pretty darn good for the price!"}
{"text":"Our trip to Vegas was business and pleasure. In my line of work it's hard to do one and not the other. Our hotel was a little bit off the strip so making your way to Bobby's was quite a walk but well worth the trip. My two other friends had eaten there the night before and they were still as excited as if it was their first time. This is was my second time the Bobby Flay's and although I wanted to try something different I decided to go with the sure thing and I went with the New Mexico burger. The burgers are thick cooked to order, Angus beef steak patties that was covered with Monterey Jack cheese green chilies and onions. A pickles wedge and side of sweet potato fries completed my order. It was delicious burger that was perfectly cooked. Cheese was still dripping out from between the bun....I did remove the top bun to stay on the lighter side of the carb spectrum and I guess I could've had them wrap it in romaine lettuce leaves but I decided to live a little and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I must also add that the service there is fantastic and the employees are super friendly and very courteous and very engaging and want to know how your food experience was and they are willing to make it right anyway they can. kudos to Bobby Flay not only in his burgers but in hiring superb help. I will be returning to eat these amazing burgers again and again and again."}
{"text":"We ordered the Crunch Burger &  Onion Rings.  We split both and it was Delicious and More than enough..."}
{"text":"Stood around for five minutes waiting for someone to come out and take our order. No one showed. Couple behind us confused also. Just went to the shake place next door for a burger."}
{"text":"The burgers are some of the best tasting around, fresh tasting, thick, juicy, and very flavorful.  The burgers are a 5.  The fries and onion rings were mediocre, a bit greasy and overly crunchy.  Give them a 3.  If I go back to Bobby's, I'll order the burgers, and skip the fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited in anticipation for 3 months to go to this place.  We were a party of 11 yet the staff just waved me off to find a table for ourselves. 
The menu choices looked great.  The big problem was everyone's burger tasted like it had been soaked in SALT.   They were so salty they were inedible.  I kept biting on a different side of the burger to try to find a bite that didn't taste like a salt lick.  I gave up half way through.
The French fries were completely covered in salt as well. 
All the ingredients looked superb, just ruined by a pound of salt per plate.   Such a shame. 
I had vitamin water from the drink bay and it was rancid tasting.  I tried to get another selection but there was no other non carbonated choice. 

I wanted to love this place and the staff ruined a great idea."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in a while. And adding the potato chips for the 'crunchified' burger is genius! Cooked perfectly with just the right amount of everything. Definitely coming back the next time I am in vegas."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Las Vegas on the strip. I was so hungry I would have eaten a piece of wet leather. The burgers did not disappoint. Yes, I said burgers... plural."}
{"text":"Delicious burger. Definitely one of the better options on the strip. The staff was helpful in picking a good one. The onion rings are fantastic! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A little salty, but one of the best burgers I have tasted! Atmosphere was alight. The seating was kind of weird."}
{"text":"Sorry to say...but came here because the line was out door and wrapped around the corner at shake shack (which I was dying to try) BUT Bobby's has solid burgers.

Order at the front then it's self-seating. I was super indecisive but ended up ordering the \"Dallas\" which has \"spiced-crust, coleslaw, monterey jack cheese, pickles, bbq sauce, potato chips\" ($7.95) w/ free potato chips (thought it was going to be on the side but it's actually inside the burger!?) and a side of regular fries which comes w/ the BBP fry sauce ($3.50). Food was out within 10 minutes. The burger was so tall I actually had to take out the potato chips and eat it with a fork and knife. But that aside, the burger was juicy, patty moist and bbq sauce tangy, buns nicely toasted, and pickles to lighten up the mood. Your typical standard/solid burger. The fries  were nice and crisp (though I could do crispier) and lightly salted. Not a fan of the BBP sauce though (the horseradish/mustard-y taste was too strong for me) so ended up using bbq ketchup (Bbq burger and bbq fries? Never too much bbq). 

Overall, solid meal for a solid deal. Would come back but...not before I cross off shake shack on my bucket list."}
{"text":"Right on Vegas Blvd. you'll find this burger joint. Can get rowdy at night with all the inebriated walking in and causing a ruckus but the service is spot on putting up with the drunks. They do serve alcohol here with beer. I went with the classic burger and combo fries with onion rings. The burger was cooked to my liking and the chips added a bit of crunch to the burger. Fries were crispy and the sweet potato fries were a standout along with the onion rings. Loved how each table came with a variety of sauces. Each sauce matched well with fries dipping but my go to has to be the chipotle sauce which went with my burger and fries. Nice place for a burger but not a standout."}
{"text":"Was absolutely disappointed with dining here was expecting alot more being that Bobby Flay has his name attached. First off this is simply above a Carl Jr's sorry to say but it is, and you get served off of plastic plate, interior looks super hip and cool, but when your burger is brought out, it reminds me of going to a weekend BBQ gathering served by uncle Fred who has been drinking beers and cooking your burgers. 

We ordered the NM Burger obviously residing in NM we thought heck lets give it a try, the condiments over killed the burger itself and the presentation was very juvenile and it made me feel like I said \"Uncle Fred\" made it....... the meat itself was pretty bland and quite small even for the low cost definitely not worth it. The price is good, but I would rather pay more to get a quality burger that is culinary inspired and using good quality condiments. 

The staff was friendly and attentive but when asked what we thought, we replied okay, she said well you order a burger right, so that is what you got a \"Burger\" they all taste the same there is nothing to it. I would never want my staff to respond that way to a guest, but as I said this is a glorified Carl Jrs, sorry Bobby Flay I would definitely take my name off so that you dont ruin your reputation or get some better training for  your staff that represents YOU!!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food, convenient location, and friendly atmosphere. The burgers and fries are both tasty, but nothing is over the top."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop here on our first night on our Vegas trip. I love Bobby so I was definitely keen!!!....

We walked and previewed the menu. Since I do not eat beef and pork I was happy to see a pretty diverse menu.

We ordered and took out seat. While waiting I checked out the décor. It is VERY nice and interesting. Splashes on warm colors, from the floor to the ceiling elements and light fixtures. The communal seating was a interesting shape but also very comfortable. The persons whom designed the space gets my vote! VERY NICE........!

The food came out pretty fast. The servers were all very helpful in explaining the sauces and the descriptions fit the individual sauce flavor profiles. We pretty much liked them all. The ones with a little kick were THAT!... But not palate killer! My wife got the beef burger of the month with cheddar. I got the turkey burger new Mexico style. My wife LOVED her burger. Even the temperature was correct!  My burger was RI-DIC-U-LOUS!!!!... From the first bite to the VERY LAST... WOW!... The queso sauce, green chiles and pickled onions were a great combination. WOW-WOW-WOW!... 

Pricing wasn't too bad, I mean, come-on.... It's on the strip!.... Let me just say, my wife and I said we were going to make it a point to visit some of favorite chef restaurants on this trip!!!... This was a GREAT prelude for what was to come on the trip!. 

Again........... WOW!. You tha man Bobby!

~Gone...... -J.V."}
{"text":"Passed by on night one and returned for a meal on night two in LV.
Neither of us eat beef. 
Wife had veggie burger, and I had one of the turkey burgers with slaw and bbq sauce.  Both delicious.
Fries just right.
Onion rings perfect.
Staff very helpful and attentive.
Decor somewhat unique (double-sided counters!) and just right for casual dining."}
{"text":"Wow.  Burger cooked as you would expect a Bobby Flay burger to be cooked.  Juicy and booming with flavor.  A little expensive for my taste, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Yum I love bobbys burger palace. I've eaten in the one in NJ several times and this location did not disappoint either. I had the Dallas burger which was delicious! Crunchified of course! (Chips in the burger... For free!). My husband and I also split a 1/2 and 1/2 of regular and sweet potato fries. This location also served alcohol which is cool."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is about right for this place.  I had the brunch burger and a 1/2 and 1/2 of sweet potato fries and onion rings and didn't walk away too impressed.  The burger was the equivalent of a Five Guys burger but with more premium toppings.  The sweet potato fries were average but their onion rings were great.

Bottom line: Worth a try, but if I had to pick, I'd rather have a Shake Shack burger every day of the week."}
{"text":"I haven't even received my food but has to comment on the staff here! Titilola is Absolutely phenomenal!! If there were rooms here, I'd stay based on hospitality alone. The staff I have encountered seem to love their job and have treated me and others with exceptional regard. I work in the social industry, helping people interact positively with others in many areas and this is one of the first restaurants in which the staff greeted with a snails, a warm welcome and genuine care. Now need to get a burger!"}
{"text":"I randomly stopped by this place as I was walking on the strip. They have a limited choice of burgers. You order and then take your seat. I ordered for a LA burger- it consisted of guacamole, watercress and tomatoes. You can choose from chicken, ham or turkey. I chose chicken. It was a bun with sesame seeds. A relishing burger. A beautiful ambience. You get a pickle of the side. I loved it."}
{"text":"I sadly can't comment on the burgers, but I can comment on the cocktails!  My friend and I were walking past and saw the sign for Happy Hour.  We'd had a few typical vegas mixed drinks already that day and as most anyone could vouch for, the typical drink is junk ingredients and alcohol. We had ordered the Long Island. After getting to the last sip, my friend and I proclaimed this was our best drink all day!!! Our adorable bartender, Caleb, said he could do even better.  He mixed up something so divinely perfect - fresh and delicious.  Needless to say, our afternoon was fantastic after that - we even came back the next day to double it up on Caleb's specialty!"}
{"text":"Fun and delicious!  My husband ordered a burger that did not say onions on the description but had onions (he's allergic) in the avocado mash.  The staff quickly got him a new burger sans onion.  The place is casual and communal and service was quick.  Very nice!"}
{"text":"Had the blue burger...prolly best burger I have had in a while. Reasonably priced and perfect for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"What a very nice place. Has a very clean sleek and modern look. The service is very good and the staff seems to be quite competent. The burger that I had was excellent. I would give it 5 stars however the potato chips were a big negative. He seems to want to put potato chips on the sandwiches. What are you trying to hide ? That may be fine but when you order french fries on top of it that seems like a bit of potato overload. By the way the French fries are excellent as well. The onion rings are not quite excellent however. They are fresh and a nice size but the batter is too highly seasoned. 

I wish they would offer just a simple plain old burger without all the fixins that their preset sandwiches come with. Every burger place should have this option for those purists who want to focus on the taste of the meat. I will return. I think he's got the best burger around. If only you could get it without all the stuff on it. I'm sure they would do it if you asked but it shouldn't be that way. They should offer a sandwich that truly showcases the meat. And his meat is delicious."}
{"text":"Such a great place for adults and kids! Burgers were some of the best! The only thing I would complain about is the prices, but that is to be expected with great food."}
{"text":"Service at the bar was great; the food not so much. The BF and I had the LA burger and their combination of fries and onion rings. I have to admit the patty on the burger was well-seasoned and really good. Everything else was nothing special. The onion rings were the better side. The fries weren't bad but nothing to rave about either. I also had the mint chocolate chip shake, which was average, but a small portion (just a small cup) for $6.50."}
{"text":"Great front of house service and excellent burgers! Make sure to get potato chips on your burger and try their homemade sauces. There are also TVs to watch your favorite sporting events while you chow down. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really great burger. Cooked well done but still juicy. Great bun and condiments. And fast."}
{"text":"Salad review. The first ingredient on the menu listed chopped vegetables. Here's what is really in this \"crunch salad\": romaine, 5 cheese squares, 4 bits of tomato, 5 garbanzo beans, 5 red beans, about 10 olives, some tortilla chips and for a little extra, a tiny piece of chicken. All in all quite strange and un satisfying for $11.50"}
{"text":"My brother and  I had spent a few hours hanging out on The Las Vegas Strip when we decided to have dinner. I like trying new places and decided to try Bobby's Burger Palace. I was impressed with Shake Shack and figured that Bobby's Burger Palace was worth trying. 

  Bobby's Burger Palace is in the modern day Kingdom called City Center. It sits at the Corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Aria Drive in the shadow of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. 

  On the Saturday evening that we visited Bobby's Burger Palace was not too busy. We walked right to the counter where you order in the left side of the building. I decided on the beef Philadelphia burger ($9.50), onion rings ($4), and fountain Coke beverage ($2). After paying, the nice lady at the counter handed us a number that we'd place on the table. 

  Bobby's Burger Palace is a relatively large restaurant with counter and Dutch style seating (large tables). The south facing views overlook the open kitchen where you get to see the action going on in the kitchen. The east facing views overlook the Las Vegas Strip with the Hawaiian Market Place. The close-up views overlook a burger and onion rings that I will talk about. 

Beef Philadelphia burger: 3 stars

    I expected a burger that brought my taste buds to the similar sensation of a Philadelphia cheesesteak. The major ingredients were beef, onions, provolone cheese, and hot peppers. It is my understanding that there is a celebrity Chef named Bobby Flay that is the architect of the burgers here. My taste buds are indifferent to celebrity chefs. Regardless that the burger was made from quality ingredients, in my opinion it was good and not great. There just wasn't much flavor to it. The hot pepper was the overwhelming taste of the burger. From my experience eating on this part of the Strip, I have had tastier burgers at Nathan's in NY-NY, Outback's, and Shake Shack. 

Onion rings: 3 stars 

   The onion rings were giant size. Looking at them was impressive. Eating them was a different story. Because they were so big, it was annoying eating it. I'd bite the onion part causing the batter to separate. I've had better onion rings. 

Conclusion: 3 stars

  Bobby's Burger Palace, in my opinion is good yet nothing spectacular. When I pay nearly $20 for a burger, fries, and Coke I prefer a meal that is spectacular."}
{"text":"This was so delicious! We randomly decided to stop here for lunch, and the burgers did not disappoint. The ingredients were fresh and delicious, and adding potato chips to burgers is a genius idea. The fries were also great, and the service was fast and friendly. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"I know the burgers are good, but I just walked up at 11:40pm and the doors are locked. I guess they aren't actually open until midnight tonight. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Burger was okay. Do not order the onion rings. I'm a bit disappointed that Bobby Flat do not have the onion ring mastered, the breading is too heavy and the onion inside is cut too thick. Sweet potato fries highly recommended and the pistachio milk shake."}
{"text":"Family of 5 went in for dinner, all tried something different and the burgers were mediocre at best. The cheese fries were great, service was non existent, and they forgot the whip cream on our $7 milkshakes. Two milk shakes, 4 burgers, 1 grilled cheese and two baskets of cheese fries was $80. Wish we would have went to In-n-out"}
{"text":"1st time Bob Flays Burger Palace \"I love the Brunch Burger\" in Las Vegas after Christmas egg needs to be more runny but overall Yummy good Lemonade,I will be back."}
{"text":"My review is only for the margarita. 

March 2016 = While walking the strip, we needed refreshment so we popped into Bobby's Burger Palace to try the prickly pear margarita. It did not disappoint. It was cold and yummy and strong and salty and just a little sweet. I wished I had purchased 2 because it was gone too soon."}
{"text":"Sorry Mr. Bobby Flay but this was just okay. 3 people and 3 different burgers and all three a bit dry when ordered medium. The flavor was okay at best as well. I can day that the frys, onion rings, fry sauce (awesome), and shakes (3 types) were very good. Burgers not so much. A bit overpriced for what we got but we love Bobby Flays recipes and make alot of his at home. I could make a Throw Down Challenge to a burger making and I have CHIPED my burger for 35 years so it would be that way as well.
Love you Mr. Flay!!!"}
{"text":"Service is superb. Food is excellent however I give a 4 because I ordered the veggie burger which has mushrooms when I asked for no mushrooms I was told it's apart of the mixture... which I don't understand if everything is made fresh to order. The veggie burger was not a patty it was like a fresh mixture as explained. So ...I agreed to the burger but was only able to take a few bites because it seemed to be mainly large pieces of mushrooms as a main part of the mixture, yuck I hate mushrooms! Everything else of the mixture was very good. Bobby flay I love your show ...my daughter and I watch you all the time with Ann on food network. You are an awesome cook, please make a veggie burger without mushrooms....I know it would be the best since you are the best! Everything else was excellent my family ....the carnivores love your burgers, fries and onion rings are the best!!! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had the brunch burger and it was just alright. The fried egg was over cooked and not runny , and the potato chips tasted like cheap plain Lays chip. Sure, i shoved chips in my burger and sandwiches as a kid, but all this did was add another layer of texture (crunch). The bun and bacon was nothing to rave about. This was a one napkin kind of burger. Fries were also average as well. I def had higher expectations for a Bobby Restaurant.

They also were all out of bud light and didn't tell me until I went to check on it at the bar after 10 minutes of waiting... really?"}
{"text":"Not really a burger palace.  You can't add another patty, make your own burger or have different types of meats.

Food is a bit pricey, pretty basic menu and honestly I would rather go to five guys."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing - however - I would love to know who taste tested and approved the burger sauce.  We had a party of 8 and everyone of us thought us was the most disgusting sauce we have ever tried.  I had higher expectations for a BBQ sauce by Bobby as well- I scrapped it off and added the yummy chipotle ketchup ! 
If not for the sauces, this would have been  a 5 star view"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service from manager....
We actually ordered our burgers well cooked. Manager advised us to next time order burgers med well for a juicy burger. ..something cashier should have recommended,  but didn't."}
{"text":"Second time here. Great burgers. I had the brunch burger. When I got it, the egg on it looked almost plastic. My first thought was 'come on Bobby, I expect better than this from you' but my first bite changed everything. The egg was perfect, and complemented the burger perfectly. I posted a picture of it for reference.

One of our group had the burger of the month, which name escapes me right now, but the feedback from that was top 5 burger I've ever had. My daughter substituted chicken for her burger, which you can do for any of their burgers, and loved hers as well. All together we ordered 6 sandwiches, 5 burgers and one chicken sandwich and all received great reviews. 

We ordered a couple of orders of fries and a couple of milkshakes. All were very good but the reason for the 4 star rather than 5 is both the fries and milkshakes were overpriced for their value. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this place. There are many places to eat in LV but I've been here twice in three trips. That's saying something as I like plenty of variety, especially in Vegas."}

{"text":"I loved this place! I didn't know that the owner, Flay challenged Iron Chef Morimoto in Japan to a rematch and won finally. Anyway Blue Burger in medium was awesome and Blue Moon was the best match. The Half and Half was too much for me but Blue Burger $9.5 , the Half and Half $5 and Blue moon $6 were reasonable for me. I will defenatly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing that this place was REALLY good & we HAD to try it.  I can see why it was suggested.  I really did like it & I was glad I did.  

I had the Vegas burger which consisted of a beef patty, white american cheese, fresno red chiles & BBQ crunch (potato chips).  I also got the half & half sides - I chose sweet potato fries & onion rings.  Both were cooked perfectly.  I loved the onion ring batter.  The sweet potato fries were crisp & divine.  I didn't care much for the dipping sauce (honey mustard horseradish sauce) - mainly because I hate any & all things mustard.  As for a drink - I opted for a spiked milkshake.  I got the Vanilla Caramel Bourbon shake.  It was amazing.

The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars was because one of the friends that came with me didn't get their order correctly (she ordered sweet potato fries - they brought her regular fries) & when it was brought to the attention of the server who brought out the food, she first argued with my friend & then said she would \"see if the fries could be made\" as if there was a possibility my friend might not get what she ordered.  It was taken care of but I didn't care for the attitude exhibited at first.  Oh & they don't have ranch.  That's always 1 less star in my book. Ha."}
{"text":"Bobbys Burger Palace lived up to its expectations and hype! The bacon crunchburger was phenomenally delicious. I loved how the chips went well inside the burger and the meat patty was definitely high quality beef! 

The sweet potatoes fries were pretty delicious as well! I highly recommend to order them crispy! The onion rings were super good as well with a nice crispy dough batter fried to perfection around each onion ring. The downside of the onion rings is that you only get 5-6 of them, but they are decently sized and delicious.

This burger joint is perfect for those refueling on the Vegas strip. I highly recommend this establishment. There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to this BBP location on 2 different trips and the quality of the food was consistent.  The burger is good as well as the onion rings.  The price is a bit high but you do get a quick good burger.  The bathroom is protected by a code but it still was a dirty mess.  Order a fountain soda and not a bottle (same price) as you can get refills and the soda machine is self serve.  To the staff and management please keep it this way as it is one of the reasons I stop in for a quick lunch.  If you looking for more of a meal (dinner) I suggest looking at Gordon Ramsey's burger place as it is more of a sit down meal and not a quick eat."}
{"text":"I tried BBP about a month ago and was not very impressed.  I decided to give it another try and this time I was going for a different burger, the LA burger.  The lady at the counter sold me on the avocado relish and I was game, this was not going to be a diet day, I went all-in, I added cheese fries and a shake.

When I got the burger, the patti was barely warm, the burger had a good flavor but it seemed that the avocado relish condiment and what seemed like a tomato pico de Gallo like just didn't let the beef shine and be the star.  The whole burger was barely warm.  Same thing with fries, the cheese was melted and they tasted really good, but they were barely warm.

Sadly I will not go back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here for a quick dinner. They had a healthy options menu which is basically any of the specialty burgers placed on top of a bed of lettuce. They even put a very light dressing over the lettuce (maybe a small amount of vinegar and oil?). It's extremely delicious and we will definitely be going here again next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"A good burger.  Out of this world, no, but good.  I had the New Mexico Burger which had queso, roasted green chilies and pickled red onions on it.  It isn't too spicy and the pickled onions are a nice addition.  I also had the cheese fries which were just a basic fry with cheez wiz or velveeta melted on top.  Good but not spectacular.  Also had the cactus pear margarita.  Beautiful color and made for good pictures but not something I would have to have again."}
{"text":"Laura was our host she is super friendly, kind and helpful! I ordered a LA burger and my girlfriend ordered a bacon crunchburger both were very delicious. You can taste the freshness in the burgers and fries. The shakes were extremely creamy and thick absolutely delicious, I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I love this place. Always worried about living up to the hype, and it did. Had the Brunch burger crunchified with onion rings and french fries. Ordered my burger medium which was cooked just right. Every bite was great with even amount of everything. First time my girlfriend had egg and chips in her burger, was amazed how well it tasted. Onion rings are best ever. Fries were also great, but wish I had gone all onion rings. Lol Burger in my top 10. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"This place use to be one of my favorite burger place to eat at while I am in Vegas. . The last couple times I came here it has been bad. The burger I got was raw. The people working here have no clue or care if you have a problem. If you do come here and have a problem food luck cause you won't see a manager to take care of it. I am done coming here. Too bad Bobby flay cant hire some decent help at this burger place. Mesa Grill is my favorite restaurant and they always take good care of the customer there. One last thing If you decide to come here don't sign up for the reward program that thing never works!"}
{"text":"Sorry but my expectations were to high. My burger was so normal. Nothing especial. The price ok for Las Vegas. I won't be back for sure. A lot of places have best hamburgers."}
{"text":"We came here for a private event , the opening of their new bar . Cocktails were really good , burgers were amazing and the staff were even better . I will definitely be back again . This place is way better then BurGR!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The prices are quite high for the small serving sizes you get. A milkshake that is about 8 ounces is $7 plus tax. Two came to $15.05. Our total dinner bill was over $38 for two small milkshakes, one small hamburger and one small arugula salad (that was really a spinach salad with a couple of arugula leaves thrown in)."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing. My husband got brunch burger and said it was best burger he ever had. I got the new veggie burger and it was soooooo good. Flavors are right on. The buns were so good as well not too \"bready\" and you have to try milkshakes. So creamy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places (If not my favorite)! I always visit Bobby's Burger Palace when in vegas. A bit pricey for a burger but i don't mind throwing down $9.50 for a uniquely crafted burger cooked to my liking. Plus, this place is in a premium location (part of city center) so it's no wonder they are a little pricey. One of my favorite burgers is called the \"Vegas\" which has \"bbq crunch\" on it (aka bbq chips). Another unique creation i love is the \"Miami\" which is pressed (panini style) with ham and made up like a cordon bleu. My girlfriend loves the dark chocolate shake and has to quench her craving for it every time we go."}
{"text":"Seriously, one of the VERY BEST burgers I've ever had.  Do not make the mistake of going to Vegas and not getting a burger at Bobby's.  Once you have it you will remember it."}
{"text":"We were people watching down on the strip for some fun and decided to stop in for a burger. We were both surprised at the prices not being nearly as high as we thought they would be. Burgers were roughly $9-11 and Fries were $4. For a burger, fries, and a drink I paid what I thought would be for just a burger considering its a celebrity chef's place. 

I got the Brunch burger and it was very good. Lots of flavor and the egg yolk was nice and runny. I tried the Burger Sauce on the side and didnt care for it much but thats on the table as an optional condiment. 

My wife got the Burger of the Month, which was a Greek Burger. Her only complaint was it didnt have enough tomato but she's a tomato freak. She loved it and we both wanted to order another burger simply cause they tasted so good. 

The cashier suggested only ordering 1 order of fries that they are enough for 2. That's true unless you're a fatty like us, next time I'll get 2 orders of fries as they are very good as well. 

I look forward to trying their other burgers."}
{"text":"Tried the Crunchy Burger, it's like a plain quarter pounder with melted cheese and potato chips to add crunch to it. It tasted soooo good and complements well. The burger was well done, but you can order it medium well/rare whatever your preference. Nice spot on the strip, service is good as well. Will definitely comeback^_^"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Pickles were awesome but the Cheyenne Burger was DAYUM! I need to meet Bobby! They even have ginger ale in the fountain! It's a good day America"}
{"text":"Stopped here for fries (half regular, half sweet potato) on the way back to our hotel room at Aria. Huge servings, quick service, fresh food, delicious flavor, great dipping sauces included like chipotle mayo and honey mustard."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came to Bobby Flay's burger joint because of me. I actually believed a celebrity chef's place would offer the best burgers in town. Well let me say we were both disappointed, and my fiance kept saying \"You said these burgers would be good.\"

Well first off we were here once before for the Kahlua Vodka Mocha milkshakes. They are so good, so this time with our shake we decided to to try a burger and fries. 

Our burger arrived without the fries.  When I looked at the receipt, i noticed we were not charged for it, and by the looks and the taste of the burger, my fiance, said, \"forget it now, it's too late, and they probably will not be that good either.\"

The service is horrible all around. We watched our milkshake sit on the chef server counter for at least 10 minutes, and still none of the staff brought it to me, so I decided to go up and get it myself.

The burger was on a lousy cheap small bun, the kind you would get at McDonalds. The size of the burger was not much bigger than a regular burger at McDonalds either, but for almost 10 bucks, not including the fries, which are $4 extra.

No use thinking about the fries that we didn't get anyway. Let's go back to the burger. It was very salty and skimpy and someone in the kitchen has a heavy hand with the salt.  
There were two guys sitting next to us who were also disappointed in the same way. They said they came because of good reviews on Yelp, but after seeing the size of the burgers and then tasting them, they claimed that the Yelp reviews were BS, and they must be staged, as part of some marketing ploy by a marketing company posing as legitimate patrons, or employees of the restaurant.

You would imagine that Bobby Flay would give his patrons a good thick juicy burger that is perfectly seasoned, considering his reputation and the price, but no! 

Maybe he wants to pretend the joint is in Paris, but even in Paris at good burger places, you can find a much tastier bigger burgers.

I asked the staff if Bobby Flay ever comes to the restaurant to check on it, and they claim when he does he works in the kitchen, so I am not sure if this is his recipe done correctly, or how he runs his restaurant, or if it's a case of the \"When the cat's away, the mice will play.\"

I have not tried anything but the Kahlua Vodka Mocha milkshake and the burgers, so I can't say anything for now about the french fries or onion rings, but if the burgers they serve is any indication of what the rest of the food would be like, my fiance and I both agree, save your money and go somewhere else, especially if you know good food, this was a complete disappointment. 

Bobby Flay or no Bobby Flay, this restaurant will not stay in business long with the horrible service and the quality of the burger and bun.

We say stick with the milkshakes if you do decide to eat here!"}
{"text":"The presentation of our food was great... The taste left us desiring something more. Although the burgers were juicy, it lacked flavor. Adding ketchup and salt was a must. 5 stars for the french fries!"}
{"text":"I love this place the burgers are unique and flavorful.  The staff is always nice to me .  Also great hang over food if you want a fresh burger that is made with love go here you won't regret it."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Living in city center I frequent this spot. There was a time when Inn-n-Out or Five guys would be the default for burgers, no longer, Bobby's Burger Palace is above and beyond... new default. It's about 10$ for the burger with no sides, but given a normal cup of coffee at Starbucks is 3$, I imagine a chunk of that is Vegas location tax. My personal favorite is the L.A. with Jalepeno's but the Bobby Blue is amazing if you like Blue Cheese (non chunky) dressing."}
{"text":"We brought the family here for a quick bite to eat before seeing a show. The restaurant was either remodeling or just being finished but that didn't affect us at all. The kids had plain cheeseburgers and a grilled cheese. We split a Bobby Blue burger. On the side we got the \"Undecided\" which is both fries and onion rings as well as an order of bacon fries. Every thing tasted delicious. The kids raved about their burgers which is a rare thing. The food came out quick and we all enjoyed trying out the sauces that were on the table.   The only thing that was a minor (very minor) irritation was that the website shows a kids menu which is not available in the restaurant but the staff was really accommodating about it. Overall, we would eat here again and the kids would definitely love to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great prices and great atmosphere. The burger selection is great too. The fries, oh man so so good!  You can vote for a crunchy-fied anything as well which means they will add house made potatoes chips in top of your burger which is interesting to say the least."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the hype.  Should have known by the lack of customers in the restaurant.  Nonetheless, so many better options that this was a waste of time"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Shake Shack, but we found BBP first.  I had the brunch burger and onion rings.  No complaints here.  Very tasty!  The onion rings were really good.  Definitely recommend!  

I don't know why, but some of my friends ordered salads.  They were not good.  No surprise there!  Get a burger!"}
{"text":"Recommended by my coworker and so we decided to stop by on our first day in Las Vegas. It's a big celebrity chef burger place, not what I expected. Overall, the quality of the beef was good and service was great!

I ordered the LA Burger (Avocado relish, watercress, cheddar cheese, tomato) and my husband ordered the Bacon Crunchburger (Bacon, American cheese, potato chips). Both were really good! We also ordered sweet potato fries, yummy with the honey mustard-horseradish dipping sauce and ranch. 

It wasn't crowded, big plus for me. It was clean, staff were all friendly, cute seating, food was fresh and it hit the spot. 

Yummy burgers! We'll be back, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, but i expected more when Bobbys Flay name is on it. Price is very reasonable compared to the other burger places in Vegas. Had the philly burger and onion rings and it was tasty"}
{"text":"$16 for burger and fries. I was expecting something awesome and this wasn't even close. I had the Carolina burger, which didn't resemble the taste or flavors I have had in north or South Carolina.   However, the  sweet potato fries were winners."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Rude cashier. Every table was dirty and it took 15 minutes to get one wiped down and they seemed annoyed to clean it. Milkshake was completely melted.  Employees were acting so annoyed and rude we didn't even bother trying to get it remade. Very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"Leonora our bartender is frickn  incredible! I'm a general manager of a restaurant in Denver and I wish I had her on my team. She was patient with us, and she walked us through the menu, she made sure that we were taken care of on everything that we needed, and on top of all of that she knew this mean you inside and out without having a reference that. I need somebody like her on my team!"}
{"text":"The burger was excellent and juicy we ordered sweet potato fries and by far the best I have ever had. Their burger sauce is to die for! The price is very reasonable compared to other restaurants. The food came fast. Overall experience was great and I truly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The people are very nice and accommodating. Me being vegan ordered the veggie burger with no cheese. The waitress let me know the patty was also coated with an egg wash before fried and that the sauce has mayo in it. Thanks for that! (Lol) Our food took a little while to come out because they had to make a fresh patty but the wait wasnt anything more than 10 mins. Anyway, the quality was amazing and the amount of food was filling. Price is right as well.. highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Kaleb makes awesome drinks very affordable drinks.All four of us had a decent buzz after our second drink."}
{"text":"I like the system here, it's efficient. I love the sauces available to the diner at the table- Great idea that nobody else does! 
I like the choices, and the burger my wife ordered was good, BUT the fries are terrible. Sorry but ya can't have a great burger and mediocre fries Bobby!
skin on? hmmm flabby? more hmmm and discolored too? well.
Go down the street a slight way to Tom's Urban. Great burger and great fries. (Just more $)"}
{"text":"New Mexico burger!!!! Always wit vainilla milk shake and sweet potato fries.
The best"}
{"text":"Very unimpressive. Not good enough for the price. Get a carls $6 burger, it's worth $6. Bobby charges $10 for a $2 version of mcdonalds with frills."}
{"text":"....first visit here was great.  so I returned.  not so great.  a little sloppy.  bathroom was dirty, had to clean my own table space, fries were cold.  1 of my 3 onion rings was the onion skin (the part you throw away).  not returning....hyped."}
{"text":"The management is exceptional, and do show that they care about their customers. Maybe the previous experience was a one off and not their typical business practice.  I am willing to give them another chance the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger! We had the Philadelphia Burger...had just the right kick to it. So glad we decided to split the sweet potato fries. It was plenty for both of us! The cactus pear margarita was delicious. You could definitely tell it had some alcohol in it!"}
{"text":"Not bad burger place. I'm not really a fancy burger type person so I'm not really into their burger of the months and stuff. I really enjoy their palace classic burger with crunch either in burger or on the side! I finish that burger so quick it makes me want to get another one. The price is a little high but if you come to eat here once in a while it's not bad. Their recent shake of the month was Nutella banana and it was so amazing (and I don't drink shakes often!)"}
{"text":"Went here for our first night in Vegas and I wanted to go here because of the name \"Bobby Flay\" - not making that mistake again. I was extremely disappointed in the food. I ordered the special of the month burger - some murberry burger. It's supposed to come with arugula but they didn't have it so I mentioned it and they brought out some withered arugula on a plate. The burger was dry and salty. I had to add the chipotle sauce to make it more palatable. 

My husband ordered the LA burger and he said his was ok; not as bad of an experience as me. He also ordered the cookies and cream shake which he liked a lot."}
{"text":"We ordered the New Mexico (turkey) and the LA burgers (beef), as well as the undecided side (half fries and half onion rings). The onion rings were crunchy and not greasy. The fries were soggy and cold. The turkey burger was extremely salty and the LA burger was good. We \"crunchified\" the burgers with potato chips and it was a terrible decision. I was expecting the chips to be homemade rather than lays chips. Overall, we were expecting more from this place given that we follow Bobby Flay's cooking and we have visited other restaurants of his which were good. In my opinion, in n out is way better my far and fresher. We will stick to going to Mesa Grill when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Average at best. I know Vegas is expensive but $9 for a cheeseburger that has America cheese. Nit eve cheddar or something with some flavor. Onion rings are hand battered but bland. You need sauce to add flavor to everything. Sweet potatoes fries were fine but nothing extraordinary. For the strip there are a lot of better options."}
{"text":"Burger was way way way too salty. My husband tried my burger and agreed. Said if he would have known he would have had them remake it. Instead I ate most of it (because I was so damn hungry) and now I'm soooo thirsty. 

The strawberry malted shake is good though."}
{"text":"It was my dad's request to come here. I wanted to venture out so I ordered the veggie burger and my boyfriend ordered the L.A. burger. Our party also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. 

Pros:
- Looked very new inside
- Menu was displayed very large after entering 
- A bar with TV's for sports lovers and HH goers 
- Sweet potato fries were delicious ( although I wish they were more crispy)
- portion was perfect 
- Prices were fair
- They have HH
- You have a choice of beef, chicken, and turkey for your burger patty!

Cons:
- Burger bun was falling apart by the end of my burger 
- Bathroom needs a code, but is printed at the bottom of your receipt!
- Cashier expected a tip right after we paid but we said we wanted to wait until after we were served before leaving one. 
- My mom's salad bowl was too small for mixing. She would prefer a larger bowl. 

Overall, my pros outweighed the cons! Would come back but I would prefer Shake Shack or In N' Out!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. When we had trouble finding it via the Crystal shops at Aria (the map said its part of them, but it's actually across the street at the Mandarin), we were a little put off. And then when it turned out to be a counter style ordering place, we got a little more worried. But it totally turned around immediately when our order was taken by a very nice and helpful employee at the counter. 

We ordered the Brunch, the Dallas, a pistachio shake (with whipped cream, as suggested by the nice counter person), and an \"undecided\" side with half fries and half onion rings which was served with two divine sauces. I ate every drop of the white ranch type sauce. 

Everything we got was delicious. Perfectly cooked burgers, amazing fries. The onion rings had some kick to them. I would say it appeared to be coarse black pepper in the batter. I liked them, but my dining partner loved them. 

We'll be back next time we're in Vegas for sure. 

Edited to include a mention of the giant, glorious pickles. So. Good."}
{"text":"Bobby,Bobby,Bobby,I dont think youd be happy if you were here. The burgers were ok, fries and onion rings, ok as well. The place was a mess. You sit at a s shaped table with people you dont know which is no big deal but when people get up and leave trash on the table it just makes everything look messy. Just not what I would expect from Bobby Flay. Sorry Bobby, we love to watch you but we will not be back."}
{"text":"When I saw the place, I immediately wanted to try it out. Well, I was disappointed with the whole meal. The burgers were overcooked and very salty. And do not get the onion rings! I don't even know if you can call them onion rings. The coating was way too thick!"}
{"text":"The burger patty was pretty good . However the bun is very boring package bun. Hard to take the burger serious when the bun was very bad. I would not go again ."}
{"text":"At first looks, this place is awesomely trendy. 
No booths to sit in, but it's not too bad. 
What threw myself and my girlfriend off, is a lot of the food was undercooked. 
On the cooking scale, if you normally get a medium rare, ask for it medium, it'll come out medium rare. 
I had a medium rare burger that was very rare. 
I was too hungry to care though. 
The sweet potato fries tasted a little raw still. 
But overall, the burgers were a good idea. Just needs to stay on the grill a little longer."}
{"text":"Bobby Flay knows burgers!  Every burger was good.  We ordered 5 of them all different and passed it around so we all got to try them all.  Every one of them was fantastic.  Fries could use some work, and the cheese fries are a little disappointing.  Guess that's why it's called a burger palace not fry palace.  The burgers are creative and ingredients are fresh.  

Love the funky decor, it was clean, and service was great!   This is a highly recommended place."}
{"text":"I kept calling this place Bobs Burgers after the cartoon.  Mr. Flay, I'm not certain if that was your intent, but the band sticks with you lol. 

I'm not a hardcore burger person, so I'm only reviewing based on the truly basic burger and fries that I did have.

It's right on the strip in front on the Mandarin Oriental, so very decent location.  The decor is kind of a throw back, but very cute.  Communal tables and chairs, kind of lunch counter/dinner type setting, very neat.  

The menu has a vast array of different types if burgers, a brunch burger that adds an egg, crunch burgers where you can add chips to pretty much any burger and so on. 

I ordered a basic cheeseburger and fries. It was very delicious.  The fries are nice and crunchy.  They have so many sauces, but I'm just a simple kind of girl, simple food, etc.  I'm not a fan of sauces, a whole lot of extra stuff on my burger.  I was glad they made it just how j asked for it.  The potion sizes were very good to me.

I got a burger, fries and drink for about $15, literally one of the cheapest meals I've had in Vegas. 

The employees were all very pleasant and helpful.  I'd come back here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The quality of food and the service. They are extremely reasonable for being on the strip. Truly the best burger on the strip"}
{"text":"I don't typically give bad reviews, but, in all honesty....I must post this review to protect the innocent and Bobby Flay should be embarrassed. Bobby's Burger Palace (Las Vegas) was far less than I had hoped for. It was my first visit, so I decided to try the \"burger of the month\"; The Canadian Burger. Unfortunately, it was the most disappointing burger I've had in a very long time. A mediocre, diminutive burger with an unremarkable meat shingle, garnished with a slice of cheese and a simple piece of Canadian bacon. At $10.95, it was certainly not worth the price and the taste was ... meh.
I also tried the bacon-cheese fries; again, not a good experience. The fries were oily, and the \"cheese\" was, well, cheese sauce (think nacho cheese sauce). To crown the experience, the fries were sprinkled with bacon bits. Bacon bits that made me wonder if they were real bacon.
I'm sorry Bobby, but you really need to up this game."}
{"text":"First off, I am a HUGE Bobby Flay fan. Maybe my expectations were too high. A Palace, it is not. One half of the restaurant was a walk-up order counter in front of a dining room sort of sorts. The other side is trying to feel like a sports bar, but misses the mark there. All of it presents a cafeteria style, completely out of synch with the high-end shops and restaurants in the area. The Brunch Burger was underwhelming. I was waiting for those big bold Bobby Flay flavours to explode and instead, it was quite bland. The patty had no sear of any kind and was not seasoned well. Like a Grandmother's meatloaf sort of a thing. The egg was raw. Like, I completely understand egg yolk as \"sauce\" but the white should be firm and the yolk should be warm and runny not cold and watery. Oddly, the bun was a highlight - light and airy, not dense, just right. The cheese fries... NOPE. I envisioned real, melted cheese, not liquid fake-ish cheese that you would expect out of a machine at 7-11 for nachos 20 years ago. I mean, maybe the cheese sauce there was house made with the finest ingredients, but.. I doubt it. Tasted like melted Velveeta. Fries had no seasoning and were limp. The lack of crisp was made worse by the \"cheese\" sauce - soggy. Honestly, the highlight was the fact that we were eating at Bobby's place and we had a friendly bar-tender to take our order. Otherwise, a let-down. I would put any of my own home-made burgers up against what I was served here with confidence. I may not be able to \"Beat Bobby Flay\", but I bet you dollars to doughnuts I can beat his minions that run this joint."}
{"text":"We came here while we were in Vegas on vacation, and Id have to say Bobby Burgers are very tasty. They are a great size portion with fries and a drink. 

The price is average for this type of place in Vegas, the service was great no lines food was ready very quickly and we had sports on at the bar."}
{"text":"Who doesn't get seduced by a celebrity chef restaurant? Vegas has tons of them. Hey range from the higher end Wolfgang Puck to the super casual Guy Fieri.  So we're craving a burger and Bobby Flay's joint popped up.  After viewing a few pics of highly stacked burgers, we were in. 

Located on the street level in front of Mandarin Oriental, it's a partial service burger joint. 

You walk in, get in line and study the menu on the wall.  Place your order with the cashier and she'll hand you a # to place on your table.  They bring the food out once it's ready, and will clean up the table when you leave. Everything else you get yourself. 

Our order:

* LA Burger w chips, avocado relish and watercress. 3/5. Good but the avocado overpowered everything else. 
* Bacon Crunch Burger, essentially a bacon cheeseburger w chips. 3/5. A bit salty & cheesy. He bottom bun was soggy & flat. I had to flip it around. 
* Undecided, which is the name of side order of any 2 items.  We chose fries & onion rings. Three
Onion rings sitting on a small bed of fries, they looked crunchy and seasoned but immediately fell apart at the slightest touch. Batter quickly became crumbs. The fries were mostly short pieces and dark in color (i.e. leftovers) had to depend on the BBQ dipping sauce, which was actually good. Fries were not.  2/5
* Blueberry cheesecake milkshake, a small cup of nicely made shake. Not too sweet but quite small for the price.  3.5/5

It's a spacious area, able to accommodate many. All seating are on stools and all tables are long communal types.  High ceiling with modern lighting, positive quotes and obviously staged photos of Mr. Flay trying to look candid make the decor very fitting of a Vegas vibe. I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend for my birthday and Bobby's Burger Palace  was an option to dine when using my Crystal's Reward Card.  Both my friend and I ordered the Crunch Burgers with her getting the beef medium well and myself getting the Turkey Burger along with fries and the Cactus Pear Margarita.  This was by far the best Turkey Burger I have ever tried as it was fresh and juicy and the potato chips gave it an extra kick.  My friend stated the same for her burger.  The order of fries were more than we expected as we did not finish both orders and wished we would have opted for just 1 order.  The sauces that were on the table were an extra treat and we tried almost all of them.  This visit and food was so good that we tried it a 2nd time on Sunday.  Thumbs up to the staff as everyone was very pleasant and helpful!!!"}
{"text":"burgers are nothing special.. french fries are mushy but pistachio shake is a must try but expensive for $6.50 before taxes. BBP sauce is a bomb and service is great."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because I had a craving for burgers and I was NOT disappointed. The burgers were moist and very, very yummy. Had the Chicago burger and ordered some regular fries on the side. I also had lemonade to drink which is also very yummy. It does not taste like the one you get from the soda machines- it actually tasted like real lemonade.

along with ketchup, they had different types of sauces to try out. I didn't fancy any of them at the time so I stuck with ketchup. 

If you have a craving for burgers, come here. It's way better than Ramsey's BURGR place and fairly more affordable as well."}
{"text":"Alright so here we go.

Banana Nutella Shake. Absolutely delicious  

The Brunch Burger Crunchified was delicious, crunchy and top notch. It was not the best burger I've had but it was easily #2-5.

He Bacon Cheese Fries we're also delicious but the cheese was bordering on the edge of nacho cheese. It was super melted and warm all throughout but I was expecting something a little different I guess.

The bathrooms. You need a code to get in. Don't forget it when you decide to go. Also, it was a terrible state inside. It's almost as if the employees were locked out and unable to clean it."}
{"text":"Seen this place on the food network, had to check it out and was not disappointed. My burger was great. I got the standard crunch burger it was cooked perfectly for my liking. I also shared the half & half onion rings- fry combo. The onion rings were huge and the fries were pretty tasty. Overall I thought it was reasonably priced for a burger place on the Strip."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from this place. Especially since it's under Bobby flays name.

The burger patty is just ok, not as juicy as I would've liked or expected. The queso on the new Mexico burger wasn't authentic queso and had more of a plastic cheese vibe. The peppers that make it spicy are really good though.

I've had a lot better burgers in my days in my opinion."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of Chef B. Flay. We have had several meals at Mesa Grill in Las Vegas before moving here. Being from The San Francisco bay area, we haven't traveled to NYC to try his other restaurants. We were pleased to discover that he was opening a Bobby's Burger Palace on the Strip. We made our way into the spot, located on the Las Vegas Blvd (Strip) in front of the Aria hotel and casino at Harmon Blvd. 
 We were smart and went in on a weekday afternoon between lunch and dinner. There was plenty of seating, and the decor was as expected of Chef Flay. I would say our first visit was within the first few weeks of opening. As expected the menu was big, bold, and easy to read and make a decision. 
 My wife ordered the New Mexico burger, I had the Carolina burger. We ordered the sweet potato fries, and I tried a dark chocolate shake.
 The burgers- 5 stars, perfectly cooked, great condiment pairings. The fries were very good, the Honey Mustard Horseradish sauce for the fries could make a flip flop tasty. The shake was amazing...the flavor was rich, bold, and pure chocolate heaven. Our first visit was 4.5 stars!
 
 Last month a good friend flew in for a afternoon between stops, I picked him up and we only had time for a quick bite, then back to the airport. I told him he had to try these burgers. Again the wife and I, our friend headed to the strip. The restaurant was far busier than our first visit, still plenty of seating. 
  The burgers and fries again were a 5/5 stars. Our friend was pleased and also impressed with the quality of food.
  The 1 star deduction is 100% related to service and dining room this time. The server who took our order did not look pleased to be employed in this day of economic status. She was distracted, in a horrible mood, and was not paying attention to the customers. Her appearance was frumpy (dumpy) very lazy. The dining room floor was quite messy, and there was plenty of staff working that could have spot swept the floor. I will say the tables were clean, the table top condiments were full and clean. I just observed the floors were covered in debris. 

  If you want a quality burger experience, then head to Bobby's Burger Palace! You will not be disapointed...Its pricy for a burger, but you taste that quality, and I have no problem paying for GOOD food. Thank you Chef Flay, we are hoping for a Bar American to launch in Vegas...hint hint"}
{"text":"We were walking along the strip checking out the different casinos and saw Bobby's Burger Palace!  It wasn't open yet but we planned to stop here for lunch on our way back down to our hotel.  I'm mildly a Bobby Flay fan, as in, I love to hate him.  We came back just before opening and waited outside until 11am.  A few other people were waiting as well and the employees actually opened a little late.  I ordered the New Mexico burger which comes with white queso, roasted green chiles and pickled red onions, medium well.  My boyfriend ordered the Bobby Blue burger, which has blue cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato and got it \"crunchified\" which puts crunchy potato chips atop your burger (free!).  He ordered a side of onion rings and I got cheese fries.  We realized after we ordered the order taker hadn't asked how he wanted his burger cooked, so he had to go back up and tell her.

Once you place your order at the counter, find a seat in the very spacious dining area.  The little bar stools were comfortable and I found the decor appealing.  Our receipt had a bathroom code on it and I realized after several people came in just wanting to use the bathroom, why that was the case.  The women's restroom was dirty and unappealing, I had a feeling Bobby wouldn't be pleased - especially since they had just opened.

Our food came out a decent time later, and the server educated us on the house-made sauces provided on the table.  I tried each of them but honestly liked none.  My burger was excellent!  So flavorful and everything on the burger really complimented one other.  I could taste that the meat was good quality beef and well-seasoned with lots of pepper.  Cheese fries were rather blah and the cheese wasn't very cheesy.  He did not care for the meat in his hamburger and found the peppery flavor to be overpowering.  It did have quite a bit of pepper on it when we opened the burger up.  Onion rings were awful, I put one in my mouth to try it and immediately upon it touching my tongue I could only taste the overpowering flavor of flour.  No seasoning at all and no flavor.  Yuck!  I would come back for the New Mexico burger though, it's the best burger I've had in a long long time!"}
{"text":"These burgers were fantastic!   Flavored well, seasoned well, cooked well!  Bacon and cheese fries were the bomb!  We had the burger of the month (Cheyanne Burger - think gourmet western bacon cheeseburger). Girls got a veggie burger crunched and LA burger crunched (means they load it with kettle cooked potato chips). Coffee milk shake was pretty great with little bits of espresso beans.  I rated it 4 stars because it was dirty.  The floors needed sweeping, the tables weren't wiped down and there were stacks of dirty dishes."}
{"text":"I came here during a week I was in Vegas for work and didn't care about cost since I could expense the week. However pretty much all the burgers without fries or a drink is $9. I had the Louisiana burger which had a pepperjack, spicy sauces, ham, chip and a thick burger with a sesame seed bun. I also got the undecided side with Onion rings and fries. 
So the good:
Really good Onions rings!
a lot of sauces for fries and burgers
creative flavors and decent burger
really friendly service overall and the place itself is unique
pick any temperature for your burger
The bad: 
Expensive: For a fast casual boutique setup I think it is pretty steep to be spending over $20 for a Drink, fries and a burger.
The bun is way too small for the burger size
The burger itself is large but lacks flavor over than just beef. 

would I come here again? Yeah it is good but, when you have Shake Shack nearby I don't see why you would not go there and save $"}
{"text":"Crunchified.  Enough said.  You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the burgers here this way.  Absolutely delish."}
{"text":"My kids loved it! The burgers and Oreo milkshakes were delightful. I had a vanilla milkshake and thought it was subpar."}
{"text":"Ended up here after deciding not to wait in the ridiculous line for Gordon Ramsey's Burgr. The price is great, service is fast and there is plenty of seating. The chocolate shake is delicious, thick and creamy. The burgers are decent as well. I love getting my burger \"crunchified\"! There are different options for meat and various sides as well. The sweet potato fries were crispy and good. We love sitting by the huge windows by the street to people watch! For it's location and reasonable price, it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"You want a good burger in Las Vegas and don't want to pay $26 for it, you go here. Not fancy, but owned by Bobby Flay so, yeah, good burgers. Amazing sweet potato fries. Avoid the margaritas if you are even the tiniest prone to brain freeze (my husband, who has never experienced it -- I know, he's an alien -- said it was the coldest thing he had ever eaten), besides they hardly had any kick to them. But the Miami Burger over the Philadelphia, definitely. Nice enough."}
{"text":"The price was right, the burgers were solid, and the fries were great! If my friend's burger hadn't come out a little more rare than it was, this would probably be a 4 1/2 star review. Great place for a quick, tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!!! Inexpensive compared to the other places on the strip! Side of fries enough for 2 people to share. Fast service. A heLthier better tasting choice to a McDonald's. 8-10 bucks for a burger they have chicken/beef/turkey. Sides are 4-5 bucks.."}
{"text":"Awesome quality beef, FRESH Kale salad with chicken, awesome drink specials!!!! When in Vegas, COME HERE!!!!! OH, SERVER, Lena was very professional and a great bartender!!!"}
{"text":"Better than a food court but not by much.

Part of a growing chain (18 restaurants in 11 states).  It's not fancy.  No build your own anything.  Make a \"concept\" selection, choose either burger, chicken, or turkey.  For beef burgers, choose a doneness level.  Opt for plain or \"crunchified\" (silly addition of chips in the sandwich).  Done.

The décor looks like a burger exploded.  Ketchup red, mustard yellow, golden bun, grilled beef brown.

Burgers are cooked to order, relatively juicy, decent beef flavor but grossly under seasoned.  Not good for mild burgers but welcome for spicy creations which are SPICY.  Toppings are fresh.  The Philadelphia Burger (provolone, griddled onions and hot peppers) packs a spicy punch but is good eats.  The LA burger (avocado, watercress, tomato and cheddar cheese) is so mild the burger is lost.

Definitely NOT a fan of the \"crunchified\" burgers.  The addition of chips adds a distracting textural contrast and nothing to the taste.  

Simple sides.  The beer battered onion rings best of the bunch.  Fries just OK.  Soggy at times.  The mayo, roasted red pepper, chipotle sauce it's served with is spicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries with honey mustard horseradish sauce is a better choice.

Very good, rich milk shake with pronounced flavors (the pistachio is worthy!)

Excellent service.

Overall, inexpensive for the Strip but not worth the pilgrimage or the wait.  This is Vegas.  X times the money does equal X times the pleasure."}
{"text":"The Dallas burger was awesome!
The staff helpful ad friendly...especially Enzo!
Reasonably priced and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I am a big burger fan and I am happy to say this place is fantastic. First of all it's nice to have a Burger cooked the way you want it which is no guarantee these days. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger medium rare and it was perfect. It was one of the best Burgers I've ever had. Second, the sweet potato fries were delicious. Finally, I loved the different ketchups they offer. For a gourmet burger I think the price was totally in line. The Manager Jeff checked on me 2 times to make sure I was happy. Great job. I realize most locals will not come here because of the location and parking but I parked in Aria self parking and walked to the strip and it was very convenient. With so many good burger places in that area alone I would highly recommend coming here. I will be back soon and when family is in from back East I know they are Bobby Flay fans we will come here."}
{"text":"This place needs a deep cleaning! Dirty dining. I ordered the Carolina burger I couldn't even finish it. Fries are extra greasy. Onion rings we're the best thing I tried."}
{"text":"Will never come here again. My husband ordered his crunch burger medium, it came out well done with the topping half off on the plate. We sent it back to try and get a medium but it came out just the same, we gave up on it. My vegetarian burger I order with no cheese and no mayo, it came out with only a slice of tomato and a couple pickles and a sprinkle of lettuce(again half of the topping off on the plate). The other reviews were raving about mushrooms in it and that it was amazing.... mine seemed like it was just a bunch of quinoa smashed together(it was falling apart). The only thing they didn't mess up was the fries we ordered and onion rings. Not impressed to pay over $35 for just decent fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"Horrible, will never return. Had high expectations for this place but was was let down. Ordered onion rings and they were ice cold.... chicken sandwich was more like I chicken tender on bread. With so many choices in Vegas go to McDonald's first"}
{"text":"The burgers were the best burgers ever.  Eight members of my family and I were visiting from Louisiana and we decided to try Bobby's burger Palace. We were not disappointed; every burger was amazing. All burgers were hot, juicy, seasoned well and delicious. The onion rings and fries were hot and crispy. Our orders were taken and served quickly. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The employees were very friendly and made sure all our needs were met. A must visit while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried bobby's burger palace on our last day in Vegas! Came here for lunch and was expecting this burger to be awesome! 

First off, atmosphere is pretty chill... very colorful with a cool bar area with flat screens! There is also some cool photos of Bobby Flay on the wall.... and you order at the front counter and they bring your food to you! 

Bobby's burger palace is right outside the Aria hotel and casino! It's a great location because it's right on the strip!

Now, we ordered a cheeseburger with fries and the burger was good... nothing that is out of the ballpark but it was a solid burger! They cooked it perfect for a medium rare.... but flavor was basic... the fries were good but it had the skin on it and some foodies like it, some don't! For me, I actually prefer no skin. The fries did come with a good aioli which is a plus!! 

I would come back and try and different burger but it's a solid 3 stars.... service is good, place is clean, and food is pretty good....

Solid 3 just because I wasn't blown out of the water... but it's solid!"}
{"text":"Finally, a reasonably priced gourmet burger spot in the center of the Las Vegas strip!

Located right next door to Pinkberry, BBP is sitting immediately in front of the Mandarin Hotel.  If you valet at Mandarin, you can walk right into BBP....only a few steps away.  If you feel like self parking, Aria will do the trick...just a bit of a walk.

All the food is priced higher here in comparison to the online menu.  Not a big deal considering the location and prices of their competition, but just know and expect it.

Once you walk in, your order at the counter and get a number...they bring the food out to you.  There are napkins and lots of house-made sauces sitting on the tables, so it's far from full service but with plenty of helping hands around to answer questions or to remove plates.

On to the food!

New Mexico Burger ($9.50): Queso Sauce, Pickled Red Onions & Pickled Jalapenos. This was very good! Initial juices flow out on the squeeze, the burger was cooked perfectly (MR), and the toppings added lots of flavor! Wish their Queso sauce was a bit thicker like their Mesa Grill counterpart....which this reminded me of strongly.  A pic for comparison :

http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Mgu4d11_d6aXxLxvExrz_g/l.jpg

French Fries ($4) with BBP Fry Sauce. These were cooked well-done+...not sure if they are supposed to be that crispy, or if mine were cooked too long. The fry sauce is good, kind of like a mayo/chile aioli.  Wish they were seasoned a bit more like Mesa Grill's Southwestern Fries...those are delicious!   Or at least give us an option for a seasoned fry :)

Vanilla Bean Milkshake ($6.50) with Whipped Cream. This was very creamy and rich...easy to drink! Wish there were adds like Nutella, Chocolate or Oreos though!

So overall, a very good burger at a good price!  I'd recommend it esp if you are walking around on the strip :P"}
{"text":"Great food!! Ordered a Dallas burger with chicken, sweet potato fries, cheese fries, and an Oreo shake. The burger was nice a juicy with the chicken and enjoyed the bun it came with. The sweet potatoe fries were nice and crispy and the cheese fries came with a lot of cheese! The Oreo shake hit the spot, not too sweet which I really liked and a lot of Oreo flavor! A lot of sauces to try but overall great and filling food!"}
{"text":"Imagine an over-priced Carl's Jr. yep, you're here. Ordering to-go? Good luck listening for your order. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Solid well rounded burgers. I got the Brunch burger w/no cheese. It was on point. The jalapeño sauce is the Boss. If your looking for a good burger at a good price Bobby Flays is the spot."}
{"text":"service was good. the shakes were great. the fries were good. the burgers were average."}
{"text":"Great burger spot with good prices to be on the Vegas strip. It was feeling, not dry at all. The shakes are awesome too. Joshua was our server and had great recommendation on sauces to go with the burgers. Good mix drinks for good prices also. Bobby is my wife's favorite chef and watches him every time he's on TV. Definitely will be back whenever in town."}
{"text":"While in Vegas for my birthday, my boyfriend and I were walking down the strip and walked by this place (almost missed it). I was skeptical because I was not really in the mood for burgers, but I gave in. 

When you walk in, you order at the counter. We were greeted by a nice girl, I think her name was Lala? Anywho, I didn't see a burger that I really wanted on the menu (I usually order the bbq, onion rings, and cheddar cheese kind of burgers); but Lala was more than happy to try and accommodate me! She started with a basic cheeseburger and just asked me what I wanted to add. Ended up with cheddar and bbq sauce, which works for me. 

You are given a number and pick from any of the open seating. They bring you your food when it's ready. A nice guy (I forget his name but he was tall and bald) came to our table and told us the food would be out soon and proceeded to bring us silverware napkins etc. when our food came, he brought us a thing of all of these different sauces and explained the Flavors and ingredients in all of them! I was pretty impressed by this place thus far.

Our burgers were sooooo juicy and delicious!! I can't even begin to describe it. My burger had a seasoned kind of crust on it that was so good.

Needless to say I would definitely come back! I wish they had this place in the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"A unique take on a classic burger! We had high expectations for a Bobby Flay restaurant, yet he delivers! The burgers we ordered were cooked exactly to our liking: I ordered the \"Las Vegas\" which was full of chilies and chipotle flavors. Surprise: there were crispy homemade BBQ potato chips inside! Loved my burger. The sesame seed bun was toasted and lightly buttered. I like how the bread didn't get soggy from the cheese and sauces on the hamburger patty.

The fries (we had both the sweet potato and the regular kind) that went with them were also homemade and delicious... we loved the different ketchups and dipping sauces available to try with the burgers and fries. My biggest mistake was not to buy a bottle of the chipotle ketchup to go! Nevertheless, I will be back and will not repeat that mistake again.

Great service, amazing food. No wonder Bobby is still the most popular Iron Chef in America!"}
{"text":"Not that impressed thought that the quality would be much better but, it was just a burger with potato chips on it.  Atmosphere was OK nothing fancy.  I was expecting more from an establishment with Bobby Flay's name on it."}
{"text":"all you people that have written good reviews about this place where were all those good things when i ate here on saturday?? Are you sure you werent high and just everything tasted good? Im so dissapopinted with this experience. For 4 people it was about $70 and i felt i didnt get anything special..You guys are talking about best burger this and that and putting this place in your top food lists..OVER FREAKING RATED im better off spending $15 at In n Out. alot of these places i try i just pay for the name everytime it so wasnt worth it sorry but i wont be back"}
{"text":"As a recent Vegas resident and lover of all things Bobby Flay, I was super stoked to find Bobby's Burger Palace on the strip to try out. In fact, I only discovered this after I watched a \"Beat Bobby Flay\" episode where it mentioned his restaurants in the credits. I looked it up...and sure enough!

First off, hardly a line for ordering and plenty of room to settle in at 8pm on a Friday night. The menu is large and viewable from the strip as you're walking by. I decided on the Veggie Burger and onion rings while my husband ordered \"the Brunch Burger\" of fried egg, bacon, and burger patty, along with regular fries.

Pros:
1. Fast food delivery from food order to table delivery
2. Great options for the vegetarian and carnivore alike :)
3. Modern atmosphere
4. Cool sauces to try with your burger at each table 

Cons:
1. Cleanliness (that particular night there were uncleared tables spotted everywhere, including the people next to us who had left 20-25 minutes before their places were cleared)
2. Average tasting food. Great ideas and options, nothing to be named special. (I expected more with Bobby Flay's name on it)
3. Hamburger buns are basic sesame seed buns
4. Customer service is.....ehhhh.

Am I being critical? Maybe. Would I eat here again? Maybe. For a cool place to try on the strip, it's worth it. Although, I'd recommend Strip Burger if you're wanting a really delicious place for burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"Still best burgers that I've found on the strip. I love that I knew exactly the first place I'd visit once I checked into my hotel.

The burgers are filling and flavorful. I strongly recommend the brunch burger as it is extremely flavorful. I hope this location stays for awhile because it will be a must visit on every Vegas trip I take."}
{"text":"My burger had a fried egg in it, totally hit the spot after a night of drinking. The vanilla milkshake was probably the most delicious item there. The fries were delicious when dipped into the chipotle ketchup sauce. The decor was a lil boring but the food was great."}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Vegas and picked this restaurant for the name - it should have been great.  The burger was good and the sauces great, but the bun on one was soggy and the bun on another one was dry.  The onion rings were just o.k.   The milk shake was good, but we didn't get it until half was through our meal.  By the way, we were only one of three tables in the place, so you can't say they were really busy.  The service was borderline - the place wasn't particularly clean and the help wasn't very welcoming.  Overall, I probably wouldn't try again."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Excellent customer service. Clean. Definitely worth a stop.  The buns are thin and the burgers are well seasoned.  A+"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch just after they opened.  It is located in front of The Mandarin and a short walk up from the Aria and City Center.  I love Bobby and wanted to try his burgers.  Knew I would crunchify anything I chose, why not?  It's  Bobby's signature burger move!  This is a walk in and order at the counter, they give you a number and then you find a seat joint.  There are long communal tables and round bar style tables.  I ordered the brunch burger medium rare which came with burger, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese.  Added lettuce, tomato and pickle at NO extra charge then crunchified it, also no charge.  Came out quickly and cooked perfectly.  The server that brought it to me said, \"Good luck,\" which I am guessing is because I created a huge burger.  I pushed it down to allow the egg to crush and the chips and then dug in.  The meat was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The flavors were all perfect together.  The bacon was crisp and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  We also ordered half fries and half rings.  Best onion rings!  Crisp, perfectly seasoned...just delicious.  The fries were great too.  All of the sauces on the table were tasty and fun to try.  I got to try Bobby's BBQ sauce, jalapeño sauce, Chipotle ketchup... all great with the rings and fries.  Burgers are all around $9.50 and the half and half side was $5.  All so reasonable!!!  All sooo yum!!!  I also liked the fact that it is really casual and they offer, beer, wine, margaritas and spiked milk shakes."}
{"text":"Really, really good burgers, great sauces, a very attentive server named Enzo, and best of all, the prices were surprisingly quite low for a restaurant with Bobby Flay's name on it. Love it, would recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Out of all the places my husband took me on our last Vegas trip, this won, hands down. The food was sooooo moderately priced! They had what we Idahoans call\"fry sauce\" but it was in all different flavors; Chipotle, Jalepeno, etc, but what I liked best was the lunch counter style seating facing Las Vegas strip so we could enjoy our food and watch the boulevard go by. Possibly the worlds best people-watching in air conditioning. We will be back next trip around!"}
{"text":"Oh Bobby's Burger Palace...I've been dreaming of you since January, when I came out for a tasting with Yelp, and I finally was able to make it out this weekend, to try you out for real.  No Yelp banners guaranteeing great service...the wonderful anonymity of being just a regular patron.

I had been raving about Bobby's since January.  
The tasting that I attended with Yelp (my first EVER Yelp event) was so wonderful, I kept looking for excuses to drive down to the strip to try the burgers again!  
I love going to events, but I always wait to review a place until I've been back as a regular paying customer.  That way I can review the food and service without any bias.

So, oddly enough, after another event on Saturday night, my fella and I met up with a friend in town for dinner at Bobby's.  

We perused the menu, and decided on our burgers, beverages, and fries.  The girl who took our order was sweet, and polite, and very friendly.

We sat down, and within a very short time, we had our drinks:  An IPA for my love, a Cactus Pear margarita for me (where have you been all my life?!) and a spiked milkshake for my friend. (it did not bring all the boys to the yard, however.) 

The service was great, we were checked on frequently, but not too frequently that we were annoyed.

The margarita was strong, and just as amazing as I remembered.  
The spiked milkshake, though...WOW.  We had the vanilla, caramel, bourbon shake, and it was heaven in a glass.  Those could be dangerous!!

The burgers came out, and they looked amazing.  
Mine:  The New Mexico Burger: with Queso sauce, roasted green chilies, and pickled red onions:  I remembered this being one of my top two at the tasting, and this did NOT disappoint!  Spicy and delicious, with flavorful beef!  It was cooked perfectly. 

BF: The Bobby Blue burger: blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato.
I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I didn't try it, but judging by how quickly it was gone, I think he liked it. ;) 

Friend: The Brunch burger: fried egg, smoked bacon, and american cheese.  I did try a bite of this one, and the egg was perfect and runny, with delicious crisp bacon!  

We also did the half and half, with sweet potato fries and french fries.  Both were awesome.  
The boys tried all of the sauces, and decided that the favorite was the Burger sauce.  

For 3 people to have a burger each, split fries, and an alcoholic beverage, it only came to $62.  That is SO reasonable.

And now for the blasphemy:  
I think I prefer Bobby's to Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  
They were both great, but Bobby's just felt like a more authentic, tastier American burger, and for half the price.  

I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"We were starving by the time we arrived in Vegas, needed something to eat ASAP! This place wasn't busy, so we popped in for some lunch. I do watch lots of Bobby Flay on Food Network, but honestly wasn't expecting much. I got the burger with bbq sauce, coleslaw, jack cheese and pickles.....honestly, I loved it. My hubby got the blue cheese bacon burger and he loved his as well. Great fries, the fry sauce was a little bland, the lemonade was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best burgers in vegas. I have been here 4 times and got a different burger everytime and they were all amazing, cooked as I asked, sides are big. staff is friendly. My favorite is the Bobby Blue with extra blue cheese. 

It could have been cleaner last time we were there.. there was a bunch of empty tables that wasn't cleaned up so we cleaned our own."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about going here as the \"celebrity chef\" restaurants always seem to disappoint. To my surprise, it was actually very good! I got the \"Dallas Burger\" and although a bit messy, it was definately yummy! The decor is cool and modern. The service was fast.....you order, pay, & then take a seat. Great location as well, right on the strip!"}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that Bobby Flay had a burger spot in Vegas.  I have eaten at Mesa Grill several times and really enjoyed my meals there.

The location on the Strip was very visible but a walk from the parking structure, but that is the case for most restaurants in Vegas on the strip.

The interior was different and fun...liked the layout of it.

Now for the food...I guess because of my experiences with Mesa Grill, I was expecting this amazing burger, fries, and onion rings.  The presentation looked tasty, but was not sold on the sesame seed bun.  It reminded me of a fast food bun, not a gourmet bun, which I was expecting.  The meat was good, but I have had better.  The fries and onion rings were tasty, and had a really good chocolate malt.

To sum it up...the service was good (friendly and helpful) and the food was good, but not great.  Next time, I think I will try one of the other burger hot spots on the Strip."}
{"text":"Burger crew meeting called to order on Saturday, May 21, 2016 at 9:30pm (Burger Crew does Vegas/Burger Crew Founders' Birthday Bash). 

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.

I. Ordering
Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Philly burgers - provolone, griddled onions, and hot peppers ($9.50) crunchified (which means with potato chips). We also ordered fries ($4).

II. The burgers
We actually asked for double crunchified and it was awesome! It seemed gimmicky at first, but everyone really enjoyed the potato chips. The burger patty was cooked perfectly to order, but they were a little on the dry side. There was a meaty flavor, but not matching some of the beautiful meatiness we've had in other burgers. The patties were seasoned heavily with black pepper, which gave it a great flavor. The peppers and onions were cooked well and despite the multitude of seeds in the peppers, they weren't overtly spicy. They gave a great little kick to the burger. The provolone seemed to fade into the background and seemed unnecessary on the burger. They didn't like the bun because it got soggy with all the juice from the onions and peppers, but I like that it has sesame seeds. They also give you a giant pickle spear! Yum!

III. The fries
Fries are good, pretty standard. They were cut a little thicker, but not too potatoey.

IV. Miscellaneous
This is located in the city center area. If you're getting dropped off by uber or lyft, get dropped off at the Mandarin Oriental entrance. It's really close to Bobby's. They have a bathroom code that you need (printed on your receipt). They have bottled and tap beer. They have some cool looking lights in the restaurant and the tables are shaped interestingly. A waiter comes by and gives you utensils and stuff, but you order at the counter before you get seated. They also have \"to go\" if you wish. The waiter told us they make 25 homemade sauces, but they only have 3 of them out for your dipping/topping pleasure. The woman who took our order, Valerie, was hilariously funny. She was great; the self proclaimed bathroom nazi.

V. Value
Value is pretty good especially because you can crunchify your burger for free! You definitely need to crunchify your burger!

VI. The verdict
The Philly is definitely not their best burger. I would recommend the Miami or the Dallas instead. However, these ratings are based on this particular burger: 3.1, 3.4, 3.7, 3.7, 3.8.

Next burger crew meeting: Gordon Ramsay Burgr after we get some drinks at Todd English PUB! Eat all the burgers!"}
{"text":"I ordered the blue cheese bacon burger, medium. It was really good and juicy. They will also split the burger for you if you tell them you're sharing. I also had their fries and onion rings which were just okay but the two sauces it came with was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Oh em gee!!!! 

We needed a quick bite and this was right next to Monte Carlo and we though eh sure. We didn't even know it was owned by bobby flay until you see alllll his stuff inside lol. I got the brunch burger which had a fried egg and bacon. You can add potato chips in it for free which I definitely did. It was seriously soooooo good. I wish I had one of those bad boys right now. Try this burger you won't regret it! 

It was about $10 for just the burger which we said was \"great for vegas\" you just used to a little bit higher of prices once you're in sin city. I remember the decor was really fun and funky. I would come back next time I'm in town, and get one of those alcohol milkshakes! 

Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"At Bobby's Burger Palace, less is more. The menu does not read like a storybook. It's simply burgers, a few sides and milkshakes done well. 

You walk up to the counter, order your food, find your seat, then it's brought to your table. Although Bobby Flay is a celebrity chef, his staff is unpretentious. My sources tell me that when this restaurant first opened, Flay was serving all his patrons and taking pictures. 

My friends ordered the LA burger with bacon and cheddar fries. I ordered the Carolina burger and regular cheese fries. We washed it all down with pistachio, strawberry and blueberry-pomegranate shakes.

The prices here were not astronomical, even though this is a celebrity chef restaurant. 

Next time, I will get my burger crunchified!"}
{"text":"5 stars for an awesome, tasty as can be dinner!
Why can't other chefs come up with this?
After noticing that Bobby Flay's swanky restaurant was closed for lunch, we were so suprised to find this new burger place of his!
Prices are great, service top notch and the food out of this world good!
The man had the burger of the month: Cheyenne Burger
Smoked Cheddar, BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Shoestring Onion Rings which he loved.
The deal here is, that you can get any burger \"crunchified\" meaning with crushed potato chips for free, so do it, it's good.
The kids meal was also amazingly good and a generous portion, great fries!
I had the crunch salad, veggies, romaine, tortillas, white cheddar, balsamic and added grilled onions, and pickled peppers, also got the meyer lemon honey mustard, avocado salsa and honey mustard horseradish on the side.
There was just so much going on in the salad, so many colors, textures and flavors, it was amazing!
Prices are more than fair, burgers and salads are under $10, sides around $3, great deal, especially in Vegas!
Seriously, this place needs to take off and be the next McDonalds, the enterior is super cool, futuristic diner with plenty of innovative ketchups, dips and sauces on each table, servers are cool, truely in love with Bobby's!"}
{"text":"I'd give this a good solid 3 1/2 Stars but unfortunately there are no half star options. There's nothing wrong with the burger except that I've tasted other burger joints close by such a Shack burger and it just doesn't compare. Perhaps the quality of meat and 1 bigger burger patty instead of 2 smaller ones. In the end the finished product was nothing to write home to mom about."}
{"text":"Bobby's Burger Palace was advertised on the TV in our hotel room PLUS my friends hyped it up, so I just had to try it. Bobby Flay? How could I say no?

Surprisingly, I was disappointed by my meal. My friend and I were joking that the water was the best part of the meal because the burgers were so salty. For me, it was the giant deli pickle on the side. I ordered the Dallas Burger ($9) which has coleslaw, Monterey Jack cheese, BBQ Sauce, and pickles. The burger itself was pretty good. I also tried some of the Brunch Burger, which has smoked bacon, American cheese, and a fried egg... but I agreed with all three of my friends who ordered that burger that it was way too salty.

I like that you can \"crunchify\" your burger, which just means they add some thin potato chips inside your burger to add an awesome sounding CRUNCH. The chips add extra salt to your burger so watch out.

The sweet potato fries ($4) were underwhelming (but the perfect amount of salt) and its honey mustard dipping sauce was super watery and did not go well with the fries. Speaking of sauces, I liked the Chipotle sauce with my burger, but stay away from the Burger sauce, ironically.

Lastly, the Cactus Pear Margarita tasted... interesting. Maybe it's because I don't know what actual cactus pear tastes like. It looks super cool AND you get to keep the cup, but I would not recommend this drink unless you are feeling adventurous.

I'm actually very glad I tried this place out, but I would not come back again."}
{"text":"BOBBY FLAY IS THE MAN... I swear I drool everytime I watch him cook on the food channel. I was super looking forward to trying his new burger spot on the strip....... Meh. I mean I wasn't disappointed because it's not like it was terrible, but it wasn't as bomb as I expected neither.

Located in front of the City Center next to Starbucks. Pretty casual spot; decently priced. I got the Philadelphia and my friend got the Los Angeles. Both were average... simple. I'd skip this and just go for Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"All around pleasant experience. Had the Carolina burger and half and half onion rings and fries. Service was outstanding, everyone was friendly and accommodating.  My burger came exactly as I ordered it (medium-well) when so many other places will ask you but you either get still moo-ing or burnt to a crisp. Opposed to some others' views on the meat being under-seasoned I found that mine was almost too seasoned but still tasty. Would return."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I have had in Vegas so far.  Everything was seasoned well down to the avocado on the burger.  The onion rings were massive and the jalapeño sauce was to die for."}
{"text":"My friend loves burgers so we ended up trying this place. Let me begin by mentioning what this place got right: location (City Center) and meat options (beef, turkey, or chicken breast). Considering these things, this place is inexpensive at $9.50 for a burger or $8.50 for the Crunchburger (double American cheese/ potato chips) + it's free to get it \"crunchified\" (BBQ potato chips in your burger); $4 for sides or $5 for half onions rings, half fries; $6.50 for shakes; $9 for spiked shakes. They also have salads and sandwiches.

Brunch Burger:
Bacon, fried egg, and American cheese. This was just alright. Plain, ordinary, nothing exciting. 3/5

Vegas Burger:
I got this with turkey and crunchified. 3.5/5

Beer-Battered Onion Rings:
The rings were huge and quite heavy. They're tasty and golden brown. 4/5

French Fries:
Real potatoes probably fried twice. They have a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Nothing new/ exciting either. 2.5/5

Dark Chocolate Shake: 
This shake didn't taste like dark chocolate at all - regular chocolate is more like it. 2/5

Black and White Shake: 
Chocolate syrup blended with vanilla ice cream. This is an old recipe and you just can't go wrong with this. 4/5

The shakes were of the right consistency - not runny, not too thick. You have no options to be creative and add toppings/ fix ins with them though. The service was alright. The place is bright, modern and clean. It just doesn't have anything worth coming here over and over."}
{"text":"Bobby should feel very lucky to have such a great staff to serve at his top notch restaurant, everything was excellent and the burger was by far the best we have ever had! Sadly to say but I'm not sure of name of the young man that was running the register and acting as host but with an attitude like that he will go far!!! Kind and courteous and very attentive, I even tried to steal him away from bobby to come to Maine and run one of my pizza locations! The place is amazing, the staff are amazing and I will go there every time I am in Vegas! By far 5 stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"There is no other street in America like Las Vegas Blvd. \"The Strip,\" that I can think of that contains some of the most popular burger chains in America. The variety of selection in the past few years has exploded on the strip. This includes huge outpost for In-N-Out, Shake Shack and White Castle. Plus celebrity chefs with their take on burgers prepared their way. So I was really looking forward to trying Bobby Flay Burger Palace. 

The atmosphere is very modern and good for large groups. Pretty much order at the counter and get served at your table. I was quite pleased with the service considering there was a line but the staff was helpful and the whole process of ordering and receiving was great. At the time of my visit, the dinning room was organized and clean. 

Onto the the food, I ordered the Brunch Burger (Fried Egg, Smoked Bacon & American Cheddar) with an order of half & half (Fries & Onion Rings). The burger was ok and wasn't that mind blowing. I personally didn't like the seasoning of the the meat patty and was on the oily side. My order of fries was on the soggy side and could've use more seasoning but I did enjoy the onion rings. A cool thing about this place is the condiment caddy and the various sauces at each table. 

Would I come back, it depends if I'm in the immediate area with family or friends who wants to check this place, other than that it's not something I would come back for. However, it's worth checking out and maybe catch a glimpse of Bobby Flay!

2017 Yelp Review #22"}
{"text":"Gotta say, I was pretty impressed.  We're locals and figured we'd give it a shot since we rarely go to the Strip.  Had the Miami burger - its a Cuban Sandwich (ham, swiss cheese, dill pickle, mustard and mayo) on top of a burger.  I was brave and got my burger rare (I figure its Bobby Flay's place - he's got a reputation to uphold!).  Damn, it was good, very rich and just the right size. Burger was super juicy and tasty. My friend got a basic cheeseburger (medium-rare) and said it was absolutely delicious.  

Clearly they have been listening to the Yelpers, because I was worried that the fries would have too much salt (i'm careful about how much salt I eat) - the fries were gorgeous; crispy and  lightly salted. My friend ate most of the them - he loved them!  It was okay though, as the burger was so filling that I couldn't have fit in anything else. Service was prompt and very friendly - the lady behind the counter was genuinely cheerful and very helpful explaining various items on the menu.  She clearly was well-versed on their menu, which is always great. Was a little pricey, but I'd definitely go back - I dare say it would be worth fighting the tourist crowds for this burger and fries.."}
{"text":"The burgers here are great, but except for the ability to \"crunchify\" them (add potato chips) upon request, there's nothing really special that distinguishes them from the ones at other gourmet burger spots on the Strip. 

The sauces for the fries and onion rings, however, are a completely different story. They're clearly the stars of the show here and definitely worth the trip. The sweet potato fries are served with a horseradish honey mustard while the regular fries come with a chipotle aioli spread. Each table also has bottles of jalapeño sauce and chipotle ketchup, both of which are highly recommended. It will set you back $4 for an average-size side of fries, but the cost is well worth it just to try these assorted sauces.

The other appealing aspect of Bobby's Burger Palace is the option for tourists to walk in directly off the Strip sidewalk. But if you're a Vegas local or a tourist with a car, I definitely suggest parking at the Mandarin Oriental valet (which is directly next door just a few feet away). You'll save yourself a long walk and the possibility of having a yardstick of beer spilled on you by a drunk and stumbling tourist.

In summary.... If money is no object, you don't mind a wait, and you're looking for the best-tasting burgers in town, there are other burger spots I would recommend more (especially if you're looking for more of a restaurant than a fast-casual place). But if you're looking for a quick bite to eat at fairly reasonable prices (compared to other gourmet burger restaurants), you could do a lot worse than Bobby's Burger Palace. I personally prefer it over I Love Burgers (Palazzo) and BLT (Mirage), which are a bit overrated in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was skeptical coming here after going to Gordon Ramsay burgr. I say that from our so so experience at burgr. I thought burgr was way too overhyped and over priced. So I was worried coming here that I may have the same experience. I was WRONG.
I am glad to be wrong in cases like this. The food was cheap for food on the strip. Just slightly more expensive than shake shack for example. 
We got the brunch burger and LA burger. Wife and both liked each alot. I would have preferred the bacon on mine a little more well done. We also ordered the split side option where we could get half onion rings and half sweet potato fries. It only gave us 4 onion rings to share but they are huge. We didn't finish them all. They were awesome. We also ordered a vanilla bean malt. Delightful. I actually preferred this malt to the shakes at burgr. The ones at burgr were just too rich. Sometimes you just need something classic. The special for this month was banana Nutella which I'm sure is amazing but we needed to save space for our trip over to the milk bar."}
{"text":"Best burger. Delicious fries. Great service!! Seek out Enzo if you're lucky enough to have the chance to stop in. He's friendly and has great recommendations! I'm sure he will explain the sauces and suggest a few. The burger sauce is out of this world! Thank you, Enzo for making our visit a visit to remember!"}
{"text":"The best burgers I have ever tasted!!  My boyfriend and I visited Las Vegas and went to Bobby's Burger Palace three days in a row."}
{"text":"Burger was delish. Chefs cooked it perfectly!!  Enzo is a great manager!!!  Thanks Bobby's crew!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here ! Walked in accidentally and walked in on happy hour . Great service from Dylan at the bar. Amazing burgers and drinks"}
{"text":"Have to say I was more than disappointed by Bobby's Burger Palace.

If you want to pay for a trendy place that Bobby Flay owns that really has terrible service then this is the place you want to go.


I ordered a blue burger, frys and a shake. The Cheese spread on the burger was pretty good. The burger was nothing special. The fries were cold and the shake was watery.  

Other members in my party had similar experiences with their meals. One final closing note was the restaurant wasn't very clean either."}
{"text":"The restaurant was not very clean, the service was slow. Some people in our party did not get their drinks.  Someone ordered a chicken burger with no cheese, it came with cheese on it.  I will not recommended this place to anyone. Being owned by Bobby Flay, you think it would have better tasting food, be cleaner and better service."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I'm only giving this a 3 because the food was decent. When we ordered at the counter two servers went back and forth in front of us about why there were no strawberry milkshakes, which is what we ordered... So we told them we didn't want the milk shake and after he rang us up we asked for an itemized receipt because the bill was high. As he handed us the receipt he admitted to charging us for the milkshake still! If we hadn't asked we wouldn't have gotten charged for it! The burgers were decent but both mine and my husbands were under cooked. I had to send mine back and didn't get a new one until my husband was almost done with his. Also we ordered the half and half of French fries and onion rings... We only got 2 onion rings... I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This Burger place is right on the stop. It's very cute inside and it has lots of burgers to chose from. You come in order with the cashier, pay and then take a seat and wait for them to bring the burgers out! 

The service was pretty friendly and very fast. 
The burgers where pretty good, however the shake that we got was the real winner here very tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for quite a while & it was just alright. I ordered the Palace classic burger medium rare - it was more rare than I would have liked it.. there wasn't any condiments on it so it was pretty tasteless & the blood from the meat being medium rare was overwhelming. My husband ordered the brunch burger & he loved it. We also ordered the fries with cheese, bacon & scallions which were just okay. The prices weren't the same as they are online, overall everything was overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ok....so its about 20% higher priced than the BBP I frequent at Mohegan sun in CT.....hey, its vegas!! We are big fans of bobbys Burgers..never knew he had almost 20 shops in the chain! ordering is easy.....the service you get is always friendly....the restaurants are always brightly lit and attractive and the food is always consistently good. This time we opted for a bobby Blue...a Crunchburger and a Classic. All cooked perfectly. The four of us shared an onion rings and a French fry. not all of us fans of the dipping sauce..but I find it very tasty. save room for their milk shakes...best ever..especially with the real whipped cream topping. I'm especially fond of the vanilla bean. It might be a little expensive than we'd like..but I find the overall experience is worth it. Bobby has a winner with this \"gourmet\" concept."}
{"text":"I love watching Bobby Flay cook on tv and there is no doubt in my mind that he is an extraordinary chef, however, he is an executive chef, not a basic burger guy and that is what is sold here.  No big fuss, exotic or fusion burgers as we expected."}
{"text":"I had a \"brunch\" burger with potato chips on top and companion had the \"blue\" Burger. We both loved the burger and would given this review 5 stars if not for the really common roll.  It just did not stand up to the burger, fell apart half way through.  I consider myself a burger expert owning the best burger restaurant in Albany New York.  Bobby, I know you are reading this review so I suggest using a more substansial roll. A hard shelled kaiser would have made it a burger to remenber.  Keep it up you are doing well."}
{"text":"Only in Vegas for three days and two of those days were spent having lunch at Bobby's burger palace ! The Dallas burger was perfect! The next day I had the New Mexico burger again I had no complaints . I looked at other burger options such as Gordon Ramsey's and other pubs they were charging 15-20 dollars a burger and 7 for fries . Bobby's burgers are 9.50 each and 4 dollar fries . Even his beers and margaritas are cheap compared to other parts of the strip"}
{"text":"As the Celebrity burger war heats up in already hot Las Vegas strip, this is a great place to enjoy a casual burger. Upscale and posh make to order burgers. They have everything made on site from sauces to fries and onion rings. They also have salads.and vegetarian options. Appropriately priced and nicely served. Give yourself little time so they can cook you a custom burger and not an assembly line burger. They have full service bar for those who are looking to get jiggy at the strip. I absolutely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Like for real!!! Awesome atmosphere... They have vegan and vegetarian options. Music is fire!!! Awesome and attentive staff, very friendly and courteous!! And seriously the best onion rings I've ever had in my life!!!"}
{"text":"I already know that my taste buds are different than most people's but I did not like the food here AT ALL.  You know it's bad when you're sitting there wishing you were eating a McDonald's Big Mac instead!  I've tried many other burgers in town - Gordon Ramsay BurGR, BLT Burger, Burger Bar, Holstein's, Commes Ca - and I liked them all better than the one I had at Bobby's Burger Palace.  Some of those burgers I might have thought were nothing special but were at the very least ok.  Even the burger I had at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill, which I thought had a weird taste to it, tasted better than the burger I got here, which was just \"meh.\"  Didn't like the bun, didn't like the meat, therefore didn't like the burger.  Also, the vanilla shake I got was just \"ok\" at best.  I like my shakes thick but theirs was on the runnier side.  Definitely can't compare to the delicious shakes at Gordon Ramsay BurGR!  Or even Jack in the Box for crying out loud! :p  I tried to eat as much of my food as possible though - $40 for a burger meal for two and it's not even a sit-down type of restaurant?  Yikes!!  Note, if you get the combo of sides and choose onion rings as one option, you get only two onion rings!  (They are big ones though.)

The place was already busy at noon on a Sunday of a holiday weekend when I went, and half an hour later just about every table was taken, at least outside.  If you do sit outside, they will bring condiments, napkins, and silverware to you.  Also beware of the flies/gnats out there.

Service: courteous and efficient but robotic.  

Give this place a try if you must.  On to the next one for me."}
{"text":"Had the LA burger, dark chocolate shake, and fries. All were awesome. Hope they build one in Miami."}
{"text":"I live here and have passed this place a number of times and finally found the time to try it. I was not disappointed. I ordered the Miami Burger without a bun and it came on a bed of greens. The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare with ham & swiss cheese melted on top. The greens were lightly dressed in balsamic dressing. Yum!

You pay at the counter when you first arrive and are given a number to place where you sit. I sat facing Las Vegas Blvd. and enjoyed the scenery. I realized I wanted to place a take out order while sitting there as I wanted my friend to try it too. One of the waitress/busser came by and I asked her if she could place the takeout order. She said \"no problem!\" So while I continued to enjoy my lunch, I was able to deal with the takeout order, pay for it, and receive it all with a smile from the server.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"The brunch burger is so good. Will definitely not disappoint anyone. You have to crunch it down and just go in for a big bite. The bacon is delicious and the party is covered in cheese! 

The blu burger is superb and I don't like blue cheese but this combo is amazing! 

Their fries and onion rings are really good. 

Their sauces that are on the table are great. Jalapeño sauce has good flavor and a bit of heat."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. The meat was seasoned to perfection, tangy red pickled onions, spicy green chilis and crunchy potato chips. The sweet potato fries are crust and sweet with a fantastic mustard horseradish dipping sauce. I have always liked Bobby Flay - the only thing that would have made this meal better is a visit from him. :)"}
{"text":"For some reason or another, we had never made it onto the Strip to try Bobby's Burger Palace until a Monday late in the evening after we arrived at the airport from a trip. My burger was delicious and the overall first impression was good enough where this location will always be considered when looking for a burger when we're on the Strip.

Once you find the restaurant just in front of the Mandarin Oriental on Las Vegas Blvd, you can order from the counter, take a number, and the food will be brought out to you. Your choice of proteins for your sandwich are Angus beef, ground turkey, or a whole chicken breast, which you can choose to crunchify. And your choice of sides are sweet potato fries, hand-cut fries, and buttermilk onion rings. If you're not in the mood for a burger, they have a griddled cheese or salad as an option. For drinks, there is a soda fountain with Coke products. They also have shakes and a small selection of beer and wine.

After we ordered, we sat on the rail close to the bar where we could still view the televisions and our food was brought out in exactly 10 minutes. Other than the rail where we were sitting, seating is at longer straight or horseshoe shaped community tables. The temperatures of the burgers are cooked to order and my wife's Palace Classic with bacon was cooked well done to her liking and was finished without a problem along with our side, The Undecided, which we chose regular fries and onion rings. There's nothing significant to say about the sides, but that's not what I was there for. My New Mexico had a nice, juicy Angus beef patty sandwiched between a lightly toasted sesame seed bun and was topped with queso sauce, roasted green chiles that provided a little smoky heat, and pickled red onion that added some acidity and crunch.

We were pleased with just about everything except my Modelo definitely had some skunkiness to it (the college frat boy in me drank the beer anyway) and someone started cleaning the rail next to us after the previous customers, but didn't finish the job, which was kind of an eye sore but none of these things are major deterrents and wouldn't keep us from coming back. Total damage for two burgers, a side, and a beer was $38."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! We had the burger of the month and the secret burger and loved them. The milkshake was also pretty bomb. The bartender, Caleb, was awesome - he gave great recommendations for other places and was so fun to talk to. We loved the eats and just hanging out. The price was definitely reasonable."}
{"text":"Fries were cold and greasy and flavorless. Hamburgers okay, not over the top like we were expecting. Got our drinks after we got our burgers. We left thinking Bobby would be pissed if he would have had the meal we had at his place!"}
{"text":"The food was good casual seating with a waiter. I had a problem with my sweet potato fries but it was worked out. Thus the four stars. I like hot food my only complaint is the bun needs to be buttered and toasted well with a little crunch then Flays burger would be great."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was quite good. My wife and I both thought our burgers fit the description of gourmet and my onion rings were delicious. The reason I gave it 5 stars is because the service was exceptional. I wasn't sure if I should order the philly burger because of the hot peppers and Jason who was taking our order offered to let me try a pepper before I ordered and it was too hot for me and it kept getting worse and Jason took pitty on me and got me a water and let me order the burger without the peppers. I later asked for the manager so I could compliment Jason for the service and found out he is the manager. That being said it is no wonder it was a good experience since they lead by example.

{"text":"I was so disappointed , Bobby Flay should revisit this place , this food did not live up to the hype. Fries too salty, my medium burger
Was more medium well . Too pricey for the 
Lack of quality . Go down the block to Gordon Ramsey's ."}
{"text":"Im so dissapointed........my burger is alright nothing special. Floor is dirty, employees are drinking & eating....... this is not waht i expected at BBP. The person who took our orders are very nice aswell as the server.

Is not busy im not sure why no one is sweeping the floor. 

Im a die hard fan of Bobby Flay......"}
{"text":"My friends and I were starving and we wanted a good burger. This place came up in a search, we didn't even know it was Bobby flays. 

Flat out one of the beast burgers I've ever had, especially for the price. To start it was perfectly cooked at a medium rare temperature. You would be surprised how few places can get this right, including higher end burger joints. I would say this place is more of a fast casual dining experience. They keep it simple here, American cheese on most of the burgers and a simple sesame bun that is soft and delicious. Now, I hear people scoffing at the American cheese, but there is nothing wrong with it on a classic American cheeseburger and it in fact has the best texture and creaminess for a great burger. 

The fries were okay, nothing special. The onion rings were good, maybe a little to big to eat. The burger sauce is what I would recommend. The chipotle is way too strong, if you opt for this sauce you might want to cut it 1/10 with normal ketchup. Even though the shakes are $6 I def recommend. I had the basic vanilla bean and it was one of the best I've ever had. Vanilla gets a bad rap, the word being almost synonymous with boring. This is quite unfair. Vanilla is one of the most complex flavor a out there and deserves a chance to shine.

If you're looking for a simple, yet great burger under $10 then bobbys burger palace is it. For my money is better than five guys and way better than in and out."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Onion rings we're fabulous. Margarita was excellent! Loved the inside and ombiance."}
{"text":"Not as good as advertised. It's dirty and the food is average at best. Fries were the only saving grace. Won't go back. Bobby needs to go visit his store and turn things around or it won't be open much longer."}
{"text":"Fries tasted as if they were dropped back in the fryer prior to serving. Soaked up all the grease. 
Service was slow and most importantly for ANY restaurant the restrooms were trashed and disgusting. 
If I was going to put my name on a place and go as far as assigning codes to get into the restrooms I would make sure that they are clean. I assume it was to keep the homeless or non customers out.
Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Love me a good burger, so we stopped in here when walking past even though we weren't at peak hunger levels. Burgers aren't huge, but that's fine as they were pretty tasty, as were the frozen margaritas. Love the retro interior design too."}
{"text":"I came for the name.
As a fan of Burgr I was expecting the same experience.
Upon entering I realized it was more casual than burger but equally as good, in its own way.
Its priced accordingly. 
I would definitely try this place out if in vegas. 

The bacon cheese fries are highly recommended.
They have these sauces on the the table and the jalapeño one was off the charts.

Will be back."}
{"text":"We ordered the Palace Classic and the Topless Palace Classic (served on baby greens instead of a bun). Love that you can get any burger \"Crunchified\" (with potato chips on top) for free. 

The burgers were tasty and the service was very fast. We went around 2pm on a Saturday and it was somewhat crowded but there was still plenty of seating. The ambience is fun and modern. 

The sweet potato fries and buttermilk onion rings were pretty good too. Plus they aren't stingy with their sauces - you'll find several different sauces on every table."}
{"text":"Seeing the affiliation with Bobby Flay immediately sparked my interest, but Bobby's Burger Palace just barely lived up to its namesake. Although the prices were reasonable and the ingredients tasted fresh, the burger was not anything extraordinary. 

My boyfriend had the Vegas burger, which was definitely more unique with red chilies and BBQ chips that gave an extra crunch. I ordered the LA burger with chicken breast, which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings. The chicken was cooked really well, but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese. Somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom, so I was holding onto mush by the end of my burger. Overall, the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special. We also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries, which came with great dipping sauces (chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce). They also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries, including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeño sauce. 

If you're looking for a relatively cheap and quick bite on the Strip, Bobby's Burger Palace can tide you over for a little bit, but I would recommend checking out other more noteworthy spots when you're in a city filled with amazing food."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Bobby Flay restaurant. Really enjoyed the brunch burger. It had such a great flavor. And the onion rings were the crispest ring I have ever had hands down. 

Have to admit I was not a fan of the seating arrangement. I prefer more private accommodations. But the atmosphere was good.

Would definitely recommend it for the food, and I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas! We are locals and have been here many times since opening and will continue to come back. Thanks for great everything"}
{"text":"So we went to Mr Triple D's and had his signature Mac Hamburger and we also went to Bobby's place and his potato chip burger. The burger, the fries, the price are the reasons Bobby wins this Vegas Strip best burger challenge. Both burgers were very tasty. Bobby's fries wins and the price of the entire meal was way less."}
{"text":"Service was not good, my burger was worse then something I could make in my own kitchen, and over all presentation wasn't very good. Trying to be nice as possible, so I will give them props on a good mint chocolate chip shake."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger in Las Vegas! Our bartender was great and very nice! Great location on the strip with very quick service and delicious food! Decent prices for Vegas eatery!"}
{"text":"I came here to experience Bobby Flay's obsession with burgers and after having the best burger experience ever at Burger by Gordon Ramsey I had high expectations and Bobby didn't disappoint. 

I order the Brunch Burger with turkey instead of a beef patty and a half and half combo featuring sweet potato fries and onion rings. The burger featured a fried egg, bacon and the usual burger trimmings and it was delicious as it but since Bobby offers a slew of different burger sauces and ketchups I tried a chipotle sauce/ketchup on my burger and it kicked it up a notch. Juicy and flavorful the actual burger meat was perfect making this another successful burger experience.  

The sweet potato fries were good, not too crunchy or soft and when dipped in the chipotle ketchup they were delicious but the onion rings were dried rings of death, over cooked and mostly batter. I couldn't find any onions and the reason for my 4 not 5 star review. I would definitely come back here again to give the onion rings another chance and to try a different burger for a new burger experience."}
{"text":"I am so glad their is a Bobby's Burger Palace on the west coast.  The food was really good.  I did the blue cheese burger with bacon but had it on a salad instead of on a bun.  It was good way to do no carbs.  My mom had the grilled cheese sandwich which she enjoyed.  We also did a fries/onion ring combo.  The onion rings were a bit big but tasty.  The fries were good too.  The burger was a bit too heavily spiced with pepper but that was my only issue.  Otherwise the food was really good and I will try it again.  Staff was super friendly.  Loved the way the seats are set up in the store."}
{"text":"It has been years since I've actually sat down and had a burger here but I had a pretty good memory of it. I was not disappointed this time around. 

Regardless of your personal feelings of Mr. Flay the guy has a natural talent for flavors. The burgers here are extremely reasonably priced for the strip and they're freaking delicious. 

A highlight for me was trying the burger sauce (which I ended up essentially just pouring into my mouth) - it's somewhat like A1, sweeter, less black pepper with some sort of fruitiness to it I can't quite figure out. It's fucking delicious. 

Fries were also correct and I look forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Ordered the crunch burger topless cooked M. The burger was tender and juicy. We had 4 ppl in our group and everyone's burgers turned out perfect. The spiked milk shakes were tasty. As far as we're concerned, you can't go wrong with anything here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service: Great! 5 stars

Food: Burgers not worth it! Over $10 for a burger, flavors were bland. Bun wasn't good, bottom layer thin and fell apart. Fries wilted, greasy- need to be fried more."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and more.  It gets a little expensive,  but worth it.  The interior is modern & nice.   The service was great."}
{"text":"The colors of this place remind me of the simpsons ride in Universal Studios. The servers were very attentive and are the only reason this place gets 2 stars. 

I came came into this place with high hopes considering Bobby Flay is definitely my favorite chef next to Gordon Ramsay. I was hoping he would not put his name on anything that was below his own standards. 

I ordered a beef burger and requested it to be cooked \"medium.\" The patty was dry, dryer than Bobby Flay's sense of humor. The patty was flaky which isn't what I look for in a bun. I expected some soft BUNS. I tried my hardest to use the sauces on the table to save the burger but it still failed to impress. 

For 10 dollars I would take my money to Fatburger across the street. I appreciate the servers but they need to get someone new in that kitchen or he should take some time to teach them properly. Bobby Flay, you have been \"chopped.\""}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my meal here. Great options on the menu and you can choose between chicken, beef, and turkey burgers. 
My order of the Dallas burger with chicken was decent. I do wish it would have come with more cole slaw...there was barely any on it. The sweet potato fries were crisp and the honey mustad sauce it comes with had a nice kick to it. All in all a satisfying meal. 
Staff was a bit slow and forgot our beer initially. 
I enjoyed there were different sauces on the table to choose from. Chipotle ketchup and jalapeno sauce were pretty good. 
I'd definitely come back again as it's great for a quick meal while out on the strip."}
{"text":"I had the New Mexico.  It was amazing.  The burger had just the right amount of heat from thw chilis.  Paired with the creamy white questo and of course, crunchified, it was perfect.  

Had the combo side with sweet potato fries and onion rings.  All perfectly crispy.

The bartender, Caleb. Was exremely friendly and made the experiemce enjoyable.  I didnt know what I wanted to drink.  Just told him what kinds of things I liked and he created something perfect.  

My only regret was that we just missed Bobby Flay by 2 days."}
{"text":"Ok, So This is my turf! \"Burgers and BBQ\" and this is my NO BIAS review of Bobby's Burger Palace @ Vegas. Menu is excellent with your pick of meat \"Beef,Chicken,Turkey\" or \"Vegetarian\". Shakes are \"ridiculous good\", Onion rings are the crunchiest I have had in my LIFE! and the main course \"BURGERS\" WOW! Excellent flavors coming out the patty, It was like bitting a piece of burger heaven in your mouth. Perfectly cooked as you choose \"I asked mine medium rare\" and the portion lets say it satisfied this guy a lot \"me\" :)
Also when it comes to service I have to mention \"Enzo\" our server, what a wonderful knowledgeable, polite and empowered guy! He knew exactly each sauce ingredient and recommended some great ones, he explained to me the whole cooking process and even mentioned that Chef Bobby Flay visits the place at least 4 times a year! He made us feel like Royalty.
Need I say more? A unique burger with creative, original, innovative, imaginative and ingenious mix of flavors and excellent balanced sauces. Bobby's Burger Palace in Las Vegas is no joke! You have to visit this joint if you come to Vegas, trust me! and lastly between burger and onion rings is around $18.00 !!! Excellent deal for the strip Specially if you compare it to my prior reviews of other Burger joints at Vegas.
Buen Provecho! Good eats!

{"text":"A turkey burger, cheeseburger, 1 soda, and an undecided  (fries and onion rings) cost us 28. My turkey burger was seasoned well and was very juicy. The fries and onion rings were really good, nice and crispy. My husband enjoyed his burger, he said it was seasoned well also.
When you walk in the resturant you place your order, they give you a number then you can sit anywhere you want. When the food is ready someone brings you your order along with silverware and napkins. 
Not what I expected but I would definately eat here again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy food!service can be iimprived. Cooks are skilled just make sure food runners don't let your food sit to long."}
{"text":"Decided after hearing good things about this place to come here for lunch while on the strip. My first impression of the place was that it was super clean and the staff was very inviting. The tables were set up in a c kind of bar way that promoted conversation and also made for a lot of setting.  There were pictures interspersed with different quotes on the wall which made for a nice touch. 
The menu itself was simplistic, pick your type of burger and then what meat you wanted. They also had some salads and different kinds of fries and onion rings that you could order.  My mom and I chose to split the crunch burger and the indecisive side which was onion rings and fries. The burger was a burger patty with cheese topped with potato chips. Even splitting it it was more than enough. It was juicy and great flavor. The onion rings were huge and lightly battered. Obviously handmade not the kind that comes from a bag. While the fries were fresh cut and flavorful. One of my favorite things was the variety of sauces that were on each table that you could try. The burger sauce was good. It had a smokey flavor that wasn't overwhelming. 
The food came out fast and hot which was also a huge plus. Even though it was a fast casual place, people still came by to make sure everything tasted alright and how you wanted. I was impressed. I had come in on the recommendation on friends and family and I have to admit they were right to recommend it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed for the service that we received. We were willing to give the food a shot, but it was bad to say the least. Cheese fries were salty and soggy. Burgers literally just a bun and tasteless meat. Overpriced. In-N-Out is waaay better. The lady who took the order was rude and didn't even answer our thank yous. They charged us for my husband's Modelo and they forgot it. We had to ask the girl to get it 3 times. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Despite a bit of a fiasco with Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill on my last trip to Vegas, I knew that I wanted to try this place when I came back because a) I love burgers and b) I just can't quit Bobby Flay no matter how hard I try.

When you walk in the place, there are no servers to help you and no signs explaining how the system works, so we just grabbed a seat. A minute or two later, a waiter told us to go to the front to order and *then* sit down. Well, great, but couldn't there have been some indication of this somewhere?

Anyway, I got the Philly (\"Provolone, griddled onions, hot peppers\") and asked for it \"crunchified\" (which just means they stack plain chips in there). We were attempting to decide between fries and onion rings when we noticed the Undecided option, which allows you to get a combination of two items from: Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and Buttermilk Onion Rings. It's a pretty sweet deal for $5.

The food arrived about 10 minutes later and it was good. Really good. The onion rings, sparse as they were, rank among the best I've ever had, while the fries were definitely above average and the accompanying dipping sauces were a perfect accompaniment. The burger itself was surprisingly delicious and impressively cooked to medium (it was pink and juicy in the middle). I guess my one complaint would be that the onions and hot peppers were cut a little too thickly for a hamburger, as several bites were just dominated by these items (while other bites didn't have any at all, essentially).

I also ordered the Milkshake of the Month, which was Dulce de Leche and it was glorious. Rich and creamy, it contained an intense caramel flavor that was impossible to resist."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: In need of fine-tuning, rough edges persist...prices of a gourmet burger establishment with the service and atmosphere of an upscale In-n-Out. I still recommend Burger Bar and Holstein's over this place. 

I ordered the Carolina Cheeseburger, and although a truly original and outstanding sauce offering, I was dismayed to learn that the burger lacks any traditional vegetables.  It's a patty with cheese and sauce.  The tastes? Great.   But to me, it is still incomplete as a burger without traditional garnish.  The onion rings were good, superior to Burger Bar's and still not as good as Top's and TwoHeys (Pasadena/Alhambra). The milk shake? Small, but not bad.

I had to ask for Thousand Island or an equivalent sauce for the onion rings. I had to ask for a slice of tomato and lettuce from the help.  What came was a lifeless piece of romaine and a tomato that for all intents appeared to have a bite taken out of it.  No taste. I'd expect nothing but the freshest and finest tomatoes and lettuce at a BF establishment, as would you. The patty was  excellent.

The air quality is low.  The stench of burger grease permeates the air.  Somehow, this is a turn-off, and I don't care if it is a burger place.  Cafeteria style seating didn't work out well due to people desiring privacy.  The bathroom wasn't really tidy either. 

What the place needs is for the owner to come back and candidly (somehow) sample the recipes and fine-tune the entire offering."}
{"text":"New Mexico #burger from Bobbys Burger Palace in #vegas 
Seriously, top 5 Burger of all time. Pickled Onions, Roasted Green #chiles 
and Queso sauce. The meat was super moist but still had a great char. Perfectly seasoned and the flavor combinations had my taste buds doing the #harlemshake 
Super soft bun that soaked up all the juices from the meat. The patty was just the right size. Maybe 5 or 6 oz. Nothing to make you feel like you got a gut bomb. Then accompanied by a simple pickle. Out of all the fancy 5 star, expensive restaurants, this place trumps them all. So simple but so #bomb @bobbyflay is the man! #foodie #beef #cheese ##vegasbaby #fat #happy"}
{"text":"Delicious - flavorful and tasty and burger meat is fresh, not frozen. Sweet potato fries so good.  We all walked away happy. I had the Carolina on greens and potato chips atop (just a few) - try it, you'll like it.

{"text":"First time here. The cashier recommend the LA burger and the bobby blue, We loved it! Thanks."}
{"text":"There is nothing to say then holy crap I love this place his burgers are amazing and don't forget the onion rings. Man my mouth is watering again haha"}
{"text":"I didn't know this was Bobby Flay's joint until I read the Yelp reviews. I had the \"Crunchburger\" and really enjoyed it! They didn't overdo the bun or the toppings so that you can really enjoy the delicious beef patty."}
{"text":"I came for the quality of the burger alone and was not disappointed. The layout of the sitting options was unique and likable too."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I like watching Booby Flay's cooking show, Mesa Grill is really good so I was really expecting something special. The buns was nothing special it tasted like store bought, the burger patty was nothing special. We ordered 5 different kinds and non of us was really impressed. I just it's nice to just go and have your picture taken for social media purposes."}
{"text":"I hate to be a person who complains about food, and I never do reviews but I feel as though it is very necessary to point this out. I went to Bobbys burger palace for the second time (first was enjoyable) and ordered a brunch burger topless style to go and took it back to my hotel. As I was eating I discovered a dead moth in the lettuce as I was about to take a bite. It was a considerable sized moth as well. I would expect something like a dead bug from a terrible chain restaurant, but not from a place with a name like Bobby Flay on it."}
{"text":"Bobby's Burger Palace is Amazing!!  I found Bobby's Burgers on the day I was scheduled to fly out and decided to extend my vacation for an extra 9-days just so I had time to try the entire menu.  Seriously it's all good. The brunch burger is my personal favorite. 

All of the burgers are good enough that they don't need extra sauce but the Burger Sauce sitting on your table is good enough that you should just try a taste anyway."}
{"text":"Margarita? Why not enjoy one with the most amazing burger I have ever had! It was absolutely made to order, the best burger I've had in a long time, the fries were great and non greasy, don't turn down the sauce the fries comes with, it was absolutely delicious! Finger-lickin' good."}
{"text":"Food came out very fast, food very delicious, perfect atmosphere overall a good experience in Vegas highly recommend"}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  If you're opening a burger joint with a chef as famous as Bobby Flay, I'd think you should be able to get the burger basics pretty much perfect.  Not so.  My son ordered a medium well basic beef burger with American cheese, pickles and lettuce.  Pretty simple, right?  Not only did the cashier have a REALLY HARD time with that basic order (we had to repeat it three times as she tried to find their closest signature specialty burgers and then figure out what key ingredients she needed to remove-- nightmare) ... but my son's burger was medium RARE (not nearly medium well as ordered) and no lettuce to be found.  Also, the fries were all messed up--clumped together, leaving them inconsistent in texture (some clumps were raw while other fries were damn near burnt).  My L.A. turkey burger with avocado \"relish\" was O.K.  First off, don't say \"avocado relish\" if you're just going to place one sliver of fresh avocado on top.  That's called \"a sample of freshly sliced avocado\" ... and the turkey was not well seasoned as you might imagine.  My love's salad was pitiful (could have done better at a cheap buffet) ... but if you're not going to have a signature veggie patty at a burger joint, then at least have a couple of really solid salads with some decent proteins.

On a positive note, the sweet potato fries were terrific (along with the dipping sauces) and the presentation was fabulous (along with some creative ambiance and seating design).  But, for nearly fifty bucks two sandwiches, a salad and one side of fries, I think I could find a better way to spend $50 on a much better meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"An overpriced burger that didn't suck. I did like the watercress, never had that on the burger before. I thought it was the only one in the world and now I'm disappointed that it's really just a chain and I could eat it in Cincinnati anyway. Shoulda gone to Gordon Ramsey's BURGR. The waitress was nice but also a bit weird."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my birthday last week and were not disappointed. The price was extremely reasonable and the portion of the burger was just right. I got the cheeseburger with the egg and was quite pleased. Also ordered a side of sweet potato fries and onion rings. The sweet potato fries were delicious, but the onion brings were a little too thick for me. It had a heavy buttermilk coat on them and I am not a fan of heavy batter. I would recommend this place and would definitely come back to try another specialty burger."}
{"text":"Horrible!  From the time I walked in the door, the young girl that took my order acted like she was doing me a favor.  There were maybe 5 customers in the entire restaurant and at least 5 employees standing around talking to each other, not interacting with their customers at all.  My table was dirty and had not been wiped.  The guy who brought my food never came back to check on me.  And to top all of the bad service off even the food was bad.  My burger was dry and flavorless, the onion rings were overcooked, fries were cold.  The whole meal was soooo disappointing.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Austin is a tremendous bartender  he makes the best drinks ever ! Also Valerie had the best recommendations for the food we ordered and it was all awesome the guy that rang up our overall order sedarian also took great care of us this but Valerie was the one that won us over I also think that the employees here were way betterthan the employees at the overpriced mesa grill Valerie and Austin need raises just sayin bobby I need you to hook these guys up!!!!!  They are awesome I will definitely be back!!!! These guys begged me not to post this review but they were to awesome not to... I recommend all eat here !!!!"}
{"text":"Oh.  My. Goodness.  Wow. This was super fantastic. We got the Carolina and the Bacon and Blue, onion rings and bacon cheese fries!!! It was phenomenal!! The Carolina was tangy and sweet! The bacon and blue was just how it sounds!!! The onion rings were the best I've had in awhile! They smell like the fair and taste even better!!! We absolutely loved it!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the veggie burger.
The veggie burger looked promising on paper. Chock full of mushrooms, and didn't have egg or milk ground into the patty? YES PLEASE!

Arrived at my table, and it looked delicious! Bit into it, and initially it didn't have much flavor, kept chewing and my face contorted into the ugliest expression I could possibly have formed. There was such a horrid chemical aftertaste. It wasn't just the patty either. The tomatoes and lettuce tasted off as well. Even the sauces at the table had that chemical taste!!! Perhaps the whole damn restaurant tasted like a chemistry lab. Bet money if I'd licked the floor, it would have that same unappealing flavor.

Seeing as how the veggie burger was the only thing on the menu suitable for my dietary needs, I know I for sure won't be back. Well, maybe if you paid me $50 I could change my mind.
Perhaps it was just an off day, idk. 

The fries were decent. Had to generously salt them, but they were crispy."}
{"text":"On my first visit I had the turkey protein/burger and it was just a little bit dry and so on my second visit I decided I was going with the beef!

It did not disappoint - I had the Texas, which comes with seasoned patty, pepper jack cheese, coleslaw and pickled (which somehow I missed on the menu as I hate pickles and should have had them removed!)

The bun was a fresh sesame seed coated one (if only Five Guys could have a bun half as fresh as this one).

It was very tasty, spicy and crunchy, cooked to a perfect medium rare - which is hard to find at many restaurants.

We shared a coffee milkshake which was also very good, not too sweet and a good coffee flavor.

The onion rings are also very good, they come with a dipping sauce which I think had chipotle in it.

There are 4 sauces to try on every table - jalapeno, mustard, chipotle ketchup and burger sauce - all are good to try with the onion rings.

The prices are reasonable for something handmade & cooked to order."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Vegas and hands down this is the best burger I had in a long time. Bang for your buck here, I will visit again before I go home!!!"}
{"text":"Nice concept of seating. Great service and another great burger joint.  On the strip in front of the Aria Accepts CC"}
{"text":"You order at a counter and then it's delivered to your chair. The burger overall was pretty good. Tried the palace traditional. The onion rings were amazing! So so good. They put out a lot of sauces and the jalapeño sauce was great. Downside- no ranch for the fries but oh well. It was hard to get the servers attention and we never got silverware or a drink we ordered but oh well. Definitely good for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Great Flavor !!! They surprised us with the quality which was superb the onions rings Awesome 
Fries were ok and the Kahlua mocha shake was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas this past Monday and wanted to try this place. If you know Bobby Flay's strengths they are in quality ingredients and he is the master of sauces and flavors. I went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. He has about 10 burgers on the menu and my wife and I tried three, all were outstanding, the Palace Classic, Bobby Blue and Philly.  All three were excellent however, the Palace Classic was the clear winner. This burger is simple in it's execution, the beef is fresh and seasoned perfectly however not pressed to a thinness that is overwhelmed by the bun, the beef is the star believe it. By simply adding to the supurbly cooked beef patty American cheese, lettuce, tomato and a slice of red onion on a sesame seed bun that holds together better than most, the Burger sauce, Chipotle sauce only enhance the flavor of the burger. It's amazing what Bobby can do to a burger,  probably one of the two best I've had period. Add a Vanilla Caramel Bourbon shake and it's simply magic. The manager, Sean keeps this place running smoothly and he engages with customers easily and he represents the brand well.  If Bobby opens one of these in Hawaii, Teddy's Big Burgers, Five Guys or any of the others will have a problem as his product is superior in quality, taste, execution and to top it off, after eating you just get up and walk out, the staff clears your table for you. Suggestion, if you are in Las Vegas and want a burger this is the place to go period."}
{"text":"I had the Carolina Burger yesterday; YUMM. This was one of the juiciest and most flavorful burger I have had in a long time. The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant was also very clean. I highly recommend trying this restaurant ."}
{"text":"HEADS UP FLAY FANS THIS REVIEW AIN'T FOR YOU!!!   The only thing I can say after this uninspiring visit I can cross it off my list and it ain't no palace!! I hope your making a lot of money selling your name, because seriously $40 for 2 burgers, fries onion rings and soda??!!! So the veg burger... No flavor, No presentation and no fries? nope that's extra!! The cruncified burger pleeeze... the only chips on it was what was left at the bottom of the bag, Major disappointment!!! I had to check again BOBBY FLAY owns this place?!! Only thing left to say is ARE YOU READY FOR A THROWDOWN? Cuz I'm pretty sure I can beat this!!!!!!  And 2 for 1 beers is a good idea, but not enough!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best burger I've ever had in my life was here, at Bobby's.  Great service as well.  Can't wait to go back and have another burger.  With chips in it, yum."}
{"text":"Skip this Burger Place altogether! It's a Burger King at Wynn prices! 

If your looking for the best Burger in Vegas I highly recommend Holsteins Shake on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel!"}
{"text":"Great burger and great service. 

I ordered the burger of the month, Cheyenne Burger, (well done) and it had a great taste. The burger was still juicy even being well done. We also ordered some fries that's enough for 2 people. It came with some chipotle mayo sauce that was a little too watery but had an ok taste. If you like shakes, you should think about getting one. Their strawberry had small bits of strawberry and wasn't overly sweet. Perfect! My boyfriend ordered the dark chocolate shake - if you like dark chocolate this may be for you. It was overly chocolately for me. 

We arrived right as the restaurant opened. The service was good and the staff was friendly. 

If you're in the mood for burgers, fries, and a shake. You should stop by!"}
{"text":"The burger was good, once I finally was able to eat it. I ordered medium-well and it definitely was not, it was falling apart covered in blood and rare. I had to have them remake it. The staff is pleasant and attentive even after I sent it back. Probably won't go back due to how it's not really something I'd feel the need to have twice. I also hate Bobby Flay."}
{"text":"When I seen this place I had high expectations because from watching Bobby Flay on tv shows he's known for his grilling! I wanted to try all the burgers! We ended up ordering the Dallas and the Bleu cheese with bacon burgers. We received our burgers and the waiter was really nice and he was very knowledgeable about the burgers. To tell you the truth nothing special and the burgers were tiny to me"}
{"text":"Walked and drove by this place while it was being built when we lived here, very excited for the opening. We moved on before it opened. :( 
We are back for work and stopped by while walking the strip.
This did not disappoint.
The burgers have a nice char which give them the perfect crunch. Ooh you can add chips, now it's a double crunch. 
Bacon Crunch Burger. Well double crunch like I said and crisp bacon. Now it's triple crunch, booyah. 
Beef Brunch Burger. You can not control were the yolk flows, bushy beards beware. You take anything that is good and make it better with a runny yolk dripping over it. (OK I would not put an egg on my ribeye) 
Onion Rings are buttermilk battered and there is lots of pepper in the batter. This could be an award winning southern fried chicken batter.
The burger was perfectly seasoned, but you add the bacon and it was to salty for my wife and boarder line for me. If not for this it would be 5 stars.
A shout out to Angel, our host at the bar. Thanks for encouraging us to drink our water before we left. It's easy to dehydrate in this desert climate when your not drinking. Dehydration and drinking is an Oh Sh!t tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"This was my first time finally stopping in at Bobby's Burger Palace with my boyfriend and it certainly won't be my last! I ordered the bacon crunch burger, and it did not disappoint. My boyfriend order the brunch burger and it was full of flavor. I love that they utilize the concept of burgers with chips inside because it takes me back to my childhood. I'd highly recommend this place if you're looking for a decently priced meal that's very filling!"}
{"text":"The juiciest well-done burger I've ever had! Soooooo good. I had the Blue burger and bacon fries. Large portions and great service for a good price."}
{"text":"Love love loveeee this place! I love Bobby flat so I had to check out his burger chain and let me tell you these burgers do not disappoint! You have to get it crunchified and trust me it was heaven in my mouth!! I will def go back when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Basically one notch above five guys burgers. Better atmosphere, and obviously a better selection of toppings, but as far as quality of food goes it's about the same."}
{"text":"Right on the  strip.  Order at counter with friendly employee.  Burgers are $10 range.  Fries and onion rings $5.   Soft drinks $3.  You get a number and go sit at comfortable tables.  Employee  brings food to you.  Quick service and staff is friendly.  Clean.  Burgers are on smaller side with run of the mill sesame bun. Toppings are stingy.  Ordered the burger of the month Napa burger. Nothing special.  Bobby burger with blue cheese is better.  Onions rings over done to almost burnt.  $40 for 2 burgers, 1 fry 2 sodas and one shake.   Shake is just run of the mill.  Nothing exciting. Overall -- probably won't come back.  Better choices out there."}
{"text":"Great food fun atmosphere. Dallas burger with potato chips was great. Having different sauces at table was fun to add. Sweet potato fries were AMAZING! Defiantly want to come back and try other burgers. I saw some  people didn't care for onion rings but I did."}
{"text":"Arrived early to beat crowds on the strip.

You stand in a line (almost no wait for us) and order, they give you a number and bring it out when it is ready.

I chose the Bacon Crunch Burger (Bacon, American Cheese, Potato Chips) and the Shake of the Month Cherry Blossom. My co-worker and I shared an order of Undecided (French Fries & Onion Rings).

The burger was a perfect Medium Well and has to be one of the top burgers I have had. The seasoning was very good and Bobby's Burger Sauce was a good addition. The bun was fairly mundane.

The only problem we ran into was my shake was apparently given to the wrong table and had to be remade. It took longer than I thought it should, we actually started to think that they had forgotten with a staff change.

I am not sure what was supposed to make the Shake Cherry Blossom flavored. I tasted plenty of cherry flavor and it was quite good. Not too thick, not too thin.

I would definitely make the trek back again when/if I return to Las Vegas or am near another location."}
{"text":"I've been having multiple dreams of dating Bobby Flay and living together in a luxurious penthouse with our cat, Nacho Flay [follow this cat on Instagram @NachoFlay].  We would eventually break up, Bobby falling in disarray because he lost the love of his life, and I would have custody of Nacho. 

*insert thinking emoji* This has absolute no relevance to my review but I guess those dreams somehow led me to eat a burger at Bobby's Burger Palace.  Wewt!

I must say, I was kind of underwhelmed.  For someone who so passionately loves burgers, how can the beef be so under-seasoned?  The cook on the meat was a perfect juicy medium-rare but most of the flavor from my burger, the flavor of the month: Napa Valley Burger [goat cheese, Meyer-lemon honey mustard, and watercress], came from the Meyer-lemon mustard.  It was too sweet for my liking.  I got mine Crunchified because I figured I needed some texture.  I did enjoy a bite of the Bobby Blue + Bacon Burger [blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato].  If you love blue cheese, you will love this burger.  To be shared was The Undecided [half order of onion ring and half order of sweet potato fries in our case].  I was excited to be able to try all his sauces as well.  The jalapeño hot sauce was fire!

Bobby's Burger Palace is a brightly lit, colorful, burger joint on a great part of The Strip.  I wouldn't mind stopping in again but real-talk, there are many better burger place on The Strip for around the same price point."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch right after we arrived in Vegas. I ordered the burger of the month, the Mulberry Street Burger, which had fresh mozzarella, basil ketchup, parmesan cheese, and baby arugula and I swapped out the burger for chicken. I really hope BBP makes this a part of their regular menu, it was delicious! Nothing was really hitting me on the regular menu, so when my friend pointed this out on the sign, I immediately decided that's what I was going to get and it did not disappoint!

We were given a number and sat down and the food was brought out. The one issue was the timing was a bit off. I placed my order right before my friend did, but I had completely eaten my sandwich by the time hers came out. The waitress did apologize though. My only other suggestion would be for another side option besides pickles to be offered. 

Overall, the chicken breast was very moist and I loved the combination of flavors, especially the basil ketchup and parmesan cheese, I was trying to wipe up every last bit of the sauce on my plate with my bun!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST burger in Vegas maybe best Ive ever had period!!! I don't normally write reviews on restaurants but i was compelled to based  on the pure quality of their product. Nate was more than helpful with our decision making and had us laughing as well. He was extremely uplifting given our luck in the casino. If your in the mood for the best burger experience in Vegas this is a must for you. Will not leave dissatisfied unless you dined elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  My husband wanted to try something of Bobby Flays since we enjoy watching his shows.  I can't handle spicey so we opted for burgers. 
There wasn't much in the way of seasoning, not salty like one review said.  The patty on both burgers came out exactly like we requested.  My husband had the LA but he with guacamole and added the green sauce to it and said it was delicious.  I had the American with bacon and it was great.  Very fresh taste and juicy. 
We were greeted at the front by the friendliest and most helpful staff member.  She was so sweet when I had the after thought of adding bacon if it wasn't trouble and her response was of course you can add it, that's never a problem.  After we sat down my husband asked if there was a way we could get his bun without sesame seeds and she immediately made sure his burger was on a seedless bun.
Very happy with lunch and would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre at best. The fries were cold and the food was tiny for what it was. The veggie burger was more expensive than the rest. The Vanilla bean milkshake was actually good but not for $7. Better off going to In n Out! 

The lady at front was nice and patient despite she was the only one ringing in people and the line was getting long."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Vegas. Mouthwatering bacon and cheese fries with their best onion rings cooked in a buttermilk mix. It's a definite destination every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Garbage. ...portions are small. Taste is is like whatever. Over priced. Came here only because \"someone\" had to come here just because of who owns it. Marketing at its best smh."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! I like my burgers medium well and that usually means dry and overcooked. This was the first medium well burger I have had that was JUICY. We also tried a side of fries and onion rings. The fries were cooked perfectly and came with a side of spiced ranch. The onion rings were flaky and crisp and well seasoned served with a creamy ranch dipping sauce. The table was set with chipolte ketchup, ketchup,yellow mustard, house hot sauce and AMAZING burger sauce...so good! We tried the miami( a cuban/burger hybrid) and the burger of the month which had goat cheese,watercress and lemon mayo. Both are worthy of a try!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Bobby Flay's shows and finally had the opportunity to try out his burger. Ordered the crunch burger comprised of a sesame bun, a meaty beef patty, American cheese and potato chips (same consistency as lays potato chips). Also order a coffee shake. Burger was tasty but didn't realize it came sauceless and no veggies. Had to ask for mayo, lettuce and tomato because I got to have those on my burger at a minimum. I give the burger a 4 after all my fixings. Good ratio meat to bun. I liked how there were 3 different sauces at the table to try: jalapeño sauce, chipotle ketchup, and a steak sauce (I think?). I liked the steak sauce the best. Coffee shake was creamy, a good thick consistency, great coffee flavor with specks of coffee beans. I would definitely come back to try his other burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"So so burger joint...Honestly tho in n out burger puts this place to shame. And it's cheaper. The burgers here are nothing really special. Solid 3 stars at the most."}
{"text":"Best Burgers I've EVER had! The L.A Burger was amazing and my husband tried the special they had one day, if I remember it was the Canadian Burger! The staff were friendly and the wait wasn't bad. Definitely a go to if you're craving a really good burger!"}
{"text":"I honestly expected a little bit more out of Bobby's burgers, especially since his hamburger buns looked and tasted like something you get out of a grocery store.
However, the hamburger itself was very delicious. What's even better is that it was only $10 for a burger."}
{"text":"My husband had the special which was a Louisiana burger he enjoyed it said it had great flavor and was a good size burger.  He also got the sweet potato fries which I tasted and thought were really quite tasty!  Would recommend for anyone craving a burger.  We sat at a counter facing the strip and enjoyed people watching while eating at Bobby's."}
{"text":"I had the brunch burger, excellent.  The onion rings we're little  over cooked. The staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"Drifting around Aria, me and my buddies sought out lunch food.  Bobby's Burger Palace got me excited considering Bobby Flay's higly acclaimed burger derivations.

Decor looks like a fast food joint.  Gourmet burgers or fast food?  * scratches head*

My overall impressions?!  Worst burger experience I have had in vegas!

Bobby Flay is known for potato chips layered in his burger.  Fine!  Adds a crunchy texture.  Crunchify works so add points for that idea!

How did BBP lose me?  All of my group's burgers were extremely salty!  Can I get some beef with my salt, please?!  Shocked at how salty our burgers, we watched as the cooks lathered up other orders with an avalanche of salt.  Oh boy!  I would assume cooks would know when too much is too much...

In addition, my patty was overcooked!  Ordered medium but received medium well...  You have one job, make burgers!

Can you customize your burger at BBP?  I didn't see pricing for that... =(

Ending this review on a positive note, the shake was delish!

Move along folks, nothing to see here!"}
{"text":"Best burgers for the price , come in and look for Lisa she will help you out and she knows her stuff , the staff is friendly and they will make them to your taste...love the fries...will recommend the chile burger...get plenty to drink with it..."}
{"text":"Ventured in here while wandering the strip. I had no idea it was associated with Bobby Flay. Happy surprise! 

I had the Dallas burger (medium well) and the sweet potato fries. Both were delicious! Burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were more full than I expected. Plus the honey mustard-horseradish sauce they served with the sweet potato fries was tasty! I spent about $15 for my burger and fries. I don't think that's terrible considering its Las Vegas. 

The burger was terribly messy but that didn't phase me. It was amazingly good!!

This is definitely a place I would go to again on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Love Bobby Flay & his cooking shows. My burger was good and flavorful. I love the addition of potato chips on the burger."}
{"text":"Perfect burgers. Good and fast service too! I would give 5 stars, but the restaurant opened today at 11:00, New Year's Day. We waited until 11:15 before the doors opened. Other than that, the onion rings were great, the vanilla milkshake was INCREDIBLE. We also had the brunch burger and LA burger. Both delicious!"}
{"text":"Um, we had the palace classic topless salad w combined fries and onion rings. One of the best tasting, juiciest angus burgers Ive ever had, decent salad, tasty fresh fries, awesome onion rings (the batter on this thing is the best), and yep. Just all awesome. Were it not for the crappy attitude of the guy who took our order (i.e. Xqs me do you have child cups? We dont have child anything, Vegas is an adult town so no) this visit would have been perfect!!!!! Love the shape of the tables and the complimentary sauces...awesome stuff."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy burger and fabulous sweet potato frys.  Also, great sauces at the tables.  I ordered the special burger of the month (August) and my guy the \"Classic\".  Very tasty-ordered medium and we got medium rare. Order more well done as they trend toward undercooked..."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Best burger I've ever had. The service is also excellent!!!  Lola and the staff are wonderful.  We felt like we were home. Great experience. We have been in Vegas for 4 days and we came back twice. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Highly impressed with Bobby's Burger Palace. As soon as I saw the name outside the business door I knew it was the famous chef's burger palace. The burger and fries came out fresh especially my sweet potato fries. Overall a great experience. Will come back again! Best burger place in Las Vegas NV."}
{"text":"Great burger, excellent flavor and potato chips as a topping choice made even better."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place!!! The burger is amazing.  My husband had the Bobby Blue burger and he absolutely loved it.  I had the burger of the month, I can't remember the name but it had fried super crispy onion rings and it was so damn good!!!my husband was expecting to be disappointed (he doesn't trust celebrity chef restaurants, I'm looking at you Guy Fieri) and he was so happy with it.  The burgers were perfectly cooked (medium) and so perfectly seasoned. It made me so sad that there's not one closer to me in NYC.  If you're ever close to a Bobby Burger Palace, just go! You will leave full and very happy"}
{"text":"Background:
Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) is easily my favorite celebrity chef burger chain. I was introduced to BBP from his locations in Maryland so naturally i was excited to see one pop up in Vegas. As of right now it's the only one west of the Mississippi River.
Anyone who has watched the food network in the past 10 years knows that Bobby Flay is known for his sauces and his moniker \"the sauce is the boss\" this bodes true to life with the food at his burger palace. 

The food:
I've had just about every burger on the menu and my favorite are the BBQ based concoctions: the Dallas and the Carolina. However, no matter what burger you decide on it's always better when you add bacon and crunchify it! It's so crazy that it took a world renowned chef to make famous what we all did when we were kids and put potato chips in our sandwich. 10yr olds idea but a $1,000,000.00 one at that. 

At each table there is an array of Bobby'ssignature sauces ranging from chipotle ketchup, barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and of course my favorites; the fry sauce and burger sauce. 
I almost feel guilty slathering the burger in all the different sauces because the burger taste awesome all by itself. They are always well seasoned and cooked to medium perfection each time I've ordered them. 

I love this place..

Crunchify my brother!!"}
{"text":"Solid Bobby Flay Burger Place. We lived across the street from his first one in Smithtown NY. This matched that one and pricing was about the same based on memory. $10-$11 for a solid burger - not bland fast food. Tip: fries are large enough for two to share. Shakes are very good too."}
{"text":"Prime location (right in the front of the CityCenter campus), celebrity name recognition, quality ingredients for another gourmet burger spot right on the Strip without the extravagant pricing = Win, Win situation for Bobby Flay and his customers, especially those in the vicinity of Aria and the surrounding properties.

If you have a MLife Rewards Card, show that to the cashier when you place your order and you will save yourself 10% right on the spot.  Instant gratification for the win!  And don't get too excited and distracted and forget about the BBP Rewards card, where every dollar spent equals 1 point, and you can redeem 100 points for a burger, sandwich or salad.  Not too shabby!

Before I get into my review of the food, let me just say that the waitstaff here are amazing.  We are not in a fancy smancy gourmet restaurant, but that does not stop the waitstaff that roams the \"patio\" and the restaurant from delivering that much appreciated authentic friendly and upbeat attitude for all the customers.  Great job of selecting fantastic employees and providing top notch training.

Now the burger.  I was going to get the New Mexico Burger, given that the description was very enticing, plus the flavor profile seems right up Bobby's alley of culinary expertise.  But I was swayed last minute by the little Burger of the Month signage where you queue up to place your order.  So I ended up getting the Canadian Burger (White Cheddar Cheese, Canadian Bacon, Maple Mustard Sauce for $10).

The burger itself was cooked perfectly (I asked for Medium Rare, and it came out juicy and red in the middle).  Presentation was simple.  The burger itself was not large and definitely not pack with too many competing ingredients and flavors.  But I would have preferred it served with some lettuce and sliced tomatoes.  The sesame seed bun was okay, probably better than what you get at McDonald's, but it is not at the same level as a fresh oven baked brioche either.  But for $10 it really is a great deal for this neighborhood.

I also ordered the Vanilla Bean Malted Shake with real whipped cream, it was good, but the portion was underwhelming and will set you back $6.50.  Personally I would just order two different burgers and be done with it and find dessert next door (PinkBerry or Starbucks).

Other details:  you have 3 choices of proteins (Certified Angus Beef, Ground Turkey and Whole Chicken Breast), no vegetarian options, and at the tables you have condiment racks filled with your typical salt and pepper, ketchup, yellow mustard, and Bobby's gourmet sauces (Chipotle Ketchup, Burger Sauce, and Jalapeno Hot Sauce).  I tried all of the gourmet sauces and all were good, but I preferred the Burger Sauce the most.

So definitely a great, relatively inexpensive spot to stop for a bite to eat as you stroll up and down the Strip or wondering inside Crystals or Aria, especially with the great friendly service (that alone bumped it up to 4 stars in my review).

Review #6 of 2014"}
{"text":"The burgers were on point but the bacon and cheese fries were served cold.  Tried the northwest burger of the month, and and the brunchburger.  Crunchify is the additional version where Lay's chips are added."}
{"text":"Great All-American burgers with a twist. I had the Home Of the Crunch burger which is a classic cheeseburger served with potato chips served in the burger. I like the fact that you can choose how you want your patty cooked. The burger was juicy and flavorful. I loved the different burger sauces they provide at every table and the Chipotle ketchup fry sauce is delicious. Tasty burger joint with good service and they have several beers on tap."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger overall, although with the reputation of Bobby Flay you almost expect something out of this world. The restaurant space is inviting with a modern fast casual vibe. The menu is themed by burgers representative of various cities in the U.S. I ordered the LA burger, which had a nice thick beef burger patty, avocado relish, watercress and tomato. The medium well burger was cooked properly and the toppings were abundant, particularly the avocado. The only real critique was the burger itself was under seasoned, which other reviewers have indicated. Something underestimated about the burger was the bread was in the right proportion (just enough to fit the ingredients, but not more). The accompany burger sauces were a pleasant surprise. The jalapeño sauce had a nice mix of heat and sweetness and the chiptole ketchup was a nice added kick from regular ketchup. The fries were crispy and salted well. Everything was fairly priced, particularly given the location. All and all a good experience and I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"The Crunch Burger was so awesome, and the Onion Rings were fantastic. I recommend getting the Vanilla Bean Milkshake, it was so creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"This place obviously is banking on its famous founder. It's ok. 5 Guys is better. I thought the service was slow and they could really care less about providing a good dining experience. The tables were dirty as well and we had to wait for them to call me and clean them. The bartender was nice and pretty quick. We would've skipped it but my 11 year old wanted to eat there. The shakes looked pretty small for the price."}
{"text":"I tried this place initially during a Yelp event, so when my friend and I were playing tourist we decided to get a quick dinner at Bobby's Burger Palace. I had a pretty good first impression from the event, so figured I would give them a try.

The line was pretty long, but went quickly. I ordered the brunch burger and I grabbed some fries from my friend's order. The sides were enormous, so definitely share if you aren't starving.

My burger was good, nothing amazing, I had hoped for a little more flavor. The burger was cooked well, but overly salted, as were the fries. 

Service was nice. They had staff walking around cleaning tables and offering refills and grabbing to go boxes. 

Nothing was a standout but it's a good option on the strip for tourists in need of a quick meal for a good price."}
{"text":"Bobby's place is convenient and reasonably priced. It is not a fancy place like Gordon Ramsey's BURGR (and the burgers are not as good, IMHO). But the burgers are solid good and the milkshakes are excellent, at least the Moka I tried.

I like the sauces they make available on the tables like the Chipotle mustard, for example. The price is quite reasonable, for the Vegas Strip.  I would come back."}
{"text":"A good burger. I had the brunch burger which pretty much was perfect for me. Egg, bacon, cheese with no veggies. Sounds like something I'd be happy to wake up to any day.

The adult milkshakes (caramel bourbon) was tasty but just to rich to finish... Between two people...

Line was short, service quick. Seating plentiful and the decor was bright and fun. Burgers were $9.99 each which, although small, I thought was reasonable for the heart of the Las Vegas strip.

We split an order of sweet potato and regular fries and the group devoured those pretty quickly.

I would be back more often if Fuku burger wasn't across the street (see review) and if I had plans to go to Vegas anytime soon (I don't... For a LONG time time...)"}
{"text":"First visit. Clean, open, and friendly. Excellent burger , without the bun option. Excellent sweet potato fries, and the best dark chocolate milkshake ever!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing good things about this place so I gave it a shot. I love that you can add potato chips to any burger FOR FREE! I'm big on texture so that made the burger even better than it was. Love the array of sauces on each table. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with great burgers and sauces. We got the bacon crunch burger and bacon cheese fries.  The burger was cooked and seasoned to perfection and the burger had potato chips that added a crunch to every bite! Next visit I will be having the brunch burger with the fried egg! Yummy!"}
