{"text":"Quite possibly the worst omelet I've ever had. It was so over cooked that they couldn't even fold it over with out slitting it in the middle.  My potatoes were also cold.  Honestly, terrible food."}
{"text":"Un must dans Villeray. Les burgers sont excellents. Je vous suggère d'essayer les frites de patate de douce. Le service est toutefois moyen."}
{"text":"Excellent petit resto de quartier. Menu diversifié et ambiance charmante. À essayer!"}
{"text":"One of Villeray's best value restaurants. Excellent table d'Hote selections, one of the best gluten-free pizzas in town. A great wine list and a very new nice vibe. Love the service!"}
{"text":"Burger was decent, service was good.  Poor selection of drinks and honestly way over priced for this little spot."}
{"text":"La nourriture était bien , mais  coûtait trop cher pour que c'était . Il y a peu , voir pas, d'options végétariennes. Il y avait un bon service . Ambiance chaleureuse ."}
{"text":"I moved to Villeray over a year ago and have been coming here almost once a month since for comfy and very affordable quality food - mostly for the great grilled octopus (perfectly cooked and tender) or grilled quail or chicken - service is very friendly, quick and ... well and and and !!!  House wine is Portuguese and very good $/quality  Will be coming back as long as I live in the area"}
{"text":"Juxtaposé au groupe prétendant à la même chose, ce resto s'identifie à se confondre tout de même à sa concurrence. Toutefois, son ensemble prouve à rassembler un spectacle d'agrément et de bonne humeur. L'aire ouverte des grandes fenêtres reçoit l'éclat d'une belle matinée d'été.   Nous étions là pour un repas lève-tôt. Un menu déjeuner familier mais soigné avec une belle presentation. Des oeufs tournés, bien cuits sans dénaturer le jaune de son coulis baveux."}
{"text":"Super resto de quartier...belle découverte. Portion plus que généreuse!  Cuisine fait maison...très goûteuse.  Risotto courge musquée: onctueux. Risotto canard et épinards: copeaux de parmesan!! Magnifique Tartare de boeuf: gagne à être plus relevé, mais déjà très goûteux!  Frites: maison...parfaite pour une poutine Purée de pommes de terre: beurrrreeeeee!   Comme si on cuisinait chez nous...avec des ingrédients frais et de l'amour...les voisins sont chanceux!"}
{"text":"Le Coin G is a cute, little neighbourhood spot hidden in a quiet part of Villeray.  It's a short (5 - 10 minute) walk from Jarry metro and if you end up driving you should be able to find free parking.  If you live nearby it would be a very relaxed spot to come to on the weekends for brunch.  The space is a little small so a reservation would be a good idea.  I was here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it wasn't too busy but it still wouldn't hurt to have one.  I can't comment on the prices since if you were here for Tartarefest (as I was) you purchased a voucher online that entitled you to a tartare and glass of wine.  The cost of the coupon was $10 which was cheap compared to what the other participating restaurants were asking for Tartarefest but I couldn't tell you how this compares to their regular menu.  I should also add that the portion of tartare was very big considering how little we paid.  As I've already said I came here for Tartarefest so I wound up eating salmon tartare.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  They had done a good job with the seasoning and it even had a little bit of a spicy kick to it.  I also ordered some fries as an appetizer and they came with a homemade spicy mayo that I enjoyed.  The service here was decent.  Initally when they took our reservation for lunch the person who took it failed to mention that the butcher wouldn't be in by then so we wouldn't be able to order tartare.  We only learned this upon arrival however the restaurant more than made this up to us.  I ordered some fries to hold me over while we waited for the butcher to arrive and our waiter gave them to me on the house.  As luck would have it we didn't have that long a wait as the butcher arrived about 30 minutes after we did.  Apart from that our server was quite attentive and friendly.  I would definitely be interested in returning here to see what a normal lunch or supper is like for the restaurant.  My first visit definitely piqued my interest and I'm eager to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Très belle découverte dans le quartier Villeray. Réservation faite 2 heures avant d'aller manger par internet et lors de notre arrivée, tout était prêt. Très bon service et agréable place. Nous y étions pour un brunch mais toute la carte nous a fait envie."}
