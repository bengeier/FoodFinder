{"text":"Owned and managed by Karachi Kitchen of whom I have always been a fan. Chicken biryani take out is $3.99 for their grand opening so everyone driving by was stopping in. 

The place has only been opened for a  weeks and unlike other South Asian in the area (Biryani King) Kebobchi has a dining area.

I picked up Haleem and Pulao (didn't want to wait for the Biryani) and both were very good. Will definitely be back and eat in next time as kids like the food as well"}
{"text":"I was shopping near by and saw this place. So thought about doing a quick take out for dinner. 

So We went in the restaurant and the restaurant had quite a lot of seating place and was clean. I ordered their kabab which came with 2 kababs and a naan plus their chicken briyani. The kababs were good but the briyani was exceptionally good. Overall successful experiment on trying this new place. 

They serve halal food at this location."}
{"text":"My family likes the food here and I thought it was mostly OK. Recently the quality of the food has changed though and we have all noticed it. We always get take out and we stick to limited dishes so maybe other items are better? So far we've only order the vegetable biryani and chicken tikka, average quality."}
