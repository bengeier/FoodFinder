{"text":"If you're looking for traditional suya,  look no further than Village Suya. The food is amazing! Every meal comes with two sides and on my first visit I ordered the beef suya (2 sticks) plus a side of mac n cheese and plantains. The meal also comes with a side salad (gotta get your greens in!). The beef is seasoned just right and the mac and cheese is to die for!! The plantains are soft with good texture and provide a nice sweet balance to the spicy suya and cheesy mac. I wasn't able to finish my meal at the restaurant (it's a lot of food!) so I took it home and polished it off.  5 stars and two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So good! I got quite a bit of food for myself and my family which was a beef Suya platter that comes with two sides. One platter we got Mac & cheese and jollof rice as sides and the other was fried plantain and jollof rice. I also ordered two pounds of suya wings. All of this came to around 54 bucks which is a great price considering how much food we got.   The beef suya is so tender and full of flavour as it should be! The suya wings were also amazing and I recommend both to everyone! Also service is great here! I love supporting my fellow Nigerians and these people make it easy to! Will definitely come back!  **SUPER PRO*** everything is halal!"}
{"text":"One star for poor customer service. UberEATS delivered more than what I ordered and before I even had a chance to realize, I had received over half a dozen calls and texts from Village Suya accusing me of being a despicable cheat. It's super unprofessional to accuse a customer of trying to scam food when the real problem is with their courier service."}
{"text":"Unbelievably tasty food made fresh by the owners. Try the Suya sandwhich special, deliciously juicy steak charred on the grill, slaw filling, tangy bbq sauce to accompany, in a buttery brioche bun from the bakery next door. Love!"}
{"text":"Decent for the only Surya place in Mississauga... The quality has gone down since they first opened.. Rather a hit or miss at times"}
{"text":"Ended up here at \"Village Suya\" located 5mins away from Square One (Mavis & Rathburn). We ordered Beef Suya with Mac & Cheese and Jollof rice ($14.99) and 1/2 Chicken suya with Jollof rice ($9.99) We liked the chicken suya better, it was tender & flavourful. Overall.. It was good, but not as great compared to the ones we had at Brampton (Get Grill). For us, the food probably needs some sauce on top. Plus, the mac and cheese was served cold-ish, beef was kind of tough. But the suya flavour was there! Paid $28 for these tax included. Worth it? maybe.... or maybe not."}
