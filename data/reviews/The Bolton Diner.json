{"text":"Ok first off this place is a diner - previous reviews talk about poor decor and service: if you want haute cuisine don't go to a diner. Seriously.

I love diners and this place is a perfect, small town diner. Good, unassuming food, great breakfasts, no pretense. Totally worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I am HUGE on customer service. This place lost two stars because out of the three times I've been here for breakfast, the waitresses were not friendly ANY time. 

The food came out hot, tasted good but nothing extravagant. The portions are pretty large and the pricing is great considering what you're getting. 

The decor is rather boring and is in dire need of updating. 

If you don't care about the service and the decor then I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I dropped my rating down substantially as on my last visit my blueberry pancakes were raw in the centre. I don't mean runny, slightly cooked...I mean raw. The pancakes themselves were loaded with blueberries but I could not eat a fair amount of them because they were uncooked. Waitress could see that I left a lot of food on my plate, but never asked if there was an issue."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service terrible hours. and no I don't expect gourmet service, but when you are paid to bring food to people don't walk up looking all pissed off, if you work there it is your job to greet and satisfy customers (pretty much the definition of a server) so no I won't be wasting my money there again"}
