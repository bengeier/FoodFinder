{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the food we ordered. We frequently eat Indian food at home and usually order the same dishes. The tandoori chicken was super moist and flavorful. Samosas were wonderful. The sag paneer was less creamy than other places I have had it, but seemed to be a little closer to a stir fry. My daughter who loves chana masala thought it was just okay (less saucy and maybe the chickpeas were not as soft) but overall she enjoyed all the food. I would not say the food came quickly but it didn't stand out as way too slow either."}
{"text":"De la bonne cuisine indienne, mais trop peu et trop chère.   Le cadre de ce resto du vieux Montréal est assez chic mais l'ambiance est plutôt décontractée. Il attire une clientèle très variée dont des touristes, des jeunes couples, et des familles. Pour cette raison peut-être le resto est très bruyant ; les conversations sont difficules à suivre.  La plupart des plats étaient vraiment délicieux. Le butter chicken, le tandoori, le masala et le dal sont superbes. En revanche, le sauté de légumes n'est que moyen et leur curry de champignons n'est pas terrible. Le naan est bon mais rien d'exceptionnel.   Il faut cependant signalé un flagrant défaut : les plats sont miniscules. Ils sont censés être partagés mais il n'y en a dans chacun seulement pour une personne, et encore il faut qu'elle ne soit pas trop gourmande. Cela à des prix de fous tels $15 pour les currys, $10 pour les autres plats. C'est hallucinant. Nous avons commandé un plat par personne avec du riz et du naan et on a dû recommandé un plat et un grand plateau en plus.  Bref, un dîner pour quatre est revenu très cher, ce qui a beaucoup mitigé le plaisir qu'on y a pris."}
{"text":"Sehr gutes Essen, sehr guter Service, wirklich gute Preise und sehr schöne Innenausstattung.    Hier hat alles gestimmt. Das war wohl mein bislang bestes indisches Essen. Ich war sehr begeistert und kann das Restaurant sehr empfehlen."}
{"text":"Gandhi was the most attractive Indian restaurant I have ever visited. It is in the old part of the city and the restaurant has high ceilings and lots of overhead light, wood floors and clean, spare furniture. We ordered chicken tikka, shrimp with peppers, eggplant, and an assorted vegetable dish. Everything was really fresh and tasty and not at all oily. The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food in an upscale setting with white tablecloths and attentive waitstaff. I ordered the Bhuna Chicken Curry and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the Malaya Chicken Curry and while it was tasty, he was disappointed that it wasn't spicy."}
{"text":"Visiting from Miami Florida. Our tour guide recommended this restaurant and said it's a cut above other establishments. He certainly was  right on when he made this statement. The food,service ,decor and cleanliness of Restaurant Gandhi  were A++ Try it, you'll love this wonderful Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here with friends for dinner. The ambiance is great and the service is decent too but the conversation with the waiters was unclear. I asked them for a SIDE of Saag Aloo since I was already ordering a regular entree and they brought two full size entrees. The portions of the meal are TINY. I've been to Indian restaurants the world over and their portions are small. The butter chicken was sweet!! Yikes! That is not how you make butter chicken. And the food was at best lukewarm when it arrived. And so expensive !!! I would never go back."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner here. We ordered the butter chicken, channa masala and aloo muttar. The chicken was very good. Both vegetarian dishes were good as well, although, they could have been more flavorful. Additionally, the chickpeas and peas were both more al dente than we prefer. Overall, it was enjoyable with good service."}
{"text":"Devine, had great service and the food was especially delicious. Price is high, but I felt it was very nicely appointed and quality worth the price"}
{"text":"C'est la deuxième fois que je vais dans cet excellent restaurant indien avec ma copine. Nous avions de bon souvenirs de notre première expérience et ils nous ont accueillis à la hauteur de nos espérances!  L'accueil avec leur 3 petit plateaux de sauce au goût plus exquis les unes que les autres, accompagné d'un pain plat chapati est trop agréable pour nous mettre en appétit!  Étant donné les grosses portions à l'indienne et notre envie de manger du pain Naan, nous n'avons pas pris la table d'hôte ni d'entrée.  J'ai pris un buf Madras, malgré que le serveur m'ait averti que c'est un plat très épicé et piquant. J'aurais dû l'écouter, même si j'ai vraiment aimé l'expérience, j'ai eu un peu trop chaud à mon goût. Les épices sont fraîches et de qualité, 5 minutes après avoir fini de manger, je n'avais plus la sensation de chaleur en bouche. Ma copine quant à elle a pris le poulet tikka qui était excellent selon ses dires. J'ai aussi essayé le pain Naan farci au buf, qui était vraiment très bon et savamment épicé.  La bouffe est comparable à d'autres bon restaurent indiens, c'est typique et authentique, là où ils préforment le plus est au niveau du service. C'est vraiment un service attentionné, il ne passent jamais devant vous pour vous servir et ils ont le soucis du détail. La serviette chaude à la fin du repas pour se nettoyer les mains est particulièrement agréable, surtout après avoir manipulé le pain Naan.  Définitivement à réessayer à mon prochain passage à Montréal!"}
{"text":"Extremely good service! I've been here 2 times before with my bf and we both loved it. One time after finishing a glass of wine, he tried to pour himself more, only to be stopped by the waiter insisting that he does it. Same evening, I asked for a glass of water - it arrived in under a minute, literally.   Food is good overall. Servings are not too big, but turn out to be quite filling. I always go in ravenous but can't seem to finish everything.   Ambiance is great - the mood, the professionalism of the staff, and even the washroom is extremely presentable."}
{"text":"Hongfantian  1110, rue Clark, 514-871-8778 (première succursale au 1813, rue Sainte-Catherine O.)  Cuisine séchuannaise par excellence!  Service fort efficace, le garcon m'indiqua que mes choix, compe tenu que j'étais seul,  ne conviennaient pas car trop généreuxsi je ne pouvait en rapporter l'excédent.  J'ai donc opté pour:  Soupe aigre- douce Salade froide de méduse ( méduse, concombres, coriande et huile de sésame Boeufsauté  et piment fort Riz blanc  Accompagné d'une bière Tsingtao  L'endroit était bondé de clients asiatiques. Les quelques cIients/clientes nord- américains étaient accompagnés par des connaissances asiatiques.  L'endroit est très propre, bien éclairé et l'ambiance fort agréable.  Les plats furent à la hauteur de mes attentes, fort savoureux et servis chauds à l'exception de la salade froide de méduse, fort naturellement.  Endroit à retrouver  en groupe!"}
{"text":"I could probably just say Delicious but expensive. It's like fine cuisine of the Indian food. Naan bread was amazing, poulet au beurre delicious. It's just too expensive for what it is but the high class service makes it an amazing place for date night !"}
{"text":"There are a few Indian restaurants in the Old Port, Gandhi being the most well known. Too bad, because Mirchi (Place D'Youville) is way better.   The decor is open and elegant - almost classy, the way an expensive restaurant should be. Nice tablecloths, fair decor, good lighting. It's a good date place and gives the illusion of upper echelon dining.   The service was fine the night I went, but I've heard mixed reviews, not only on Yelp but also from friends who have gone. Depends on whether the owner is there, I guess. Anyways, it's no Taj, but service is generally acceptable.   The food is good. Nothing special, just fair. We had about 5-6 dishes, and the taste/size was fairly predictable. I don't know what else to say, if you blindfolded me and told me I was at Atma I wouldn't argue. It's definitely a cut above those Friday-night bombs like Bombay Mahal and Dev, but you're paying at least 3 times more. I'm not sure if the fact that one of the owner/chefs is a white French Quebecer has anything to do with it, but I wasn't that impressed.   Do yourself a favor - go to Mirchi instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled across this Indian restaurant for lunch one day while vacationing in Montreal from Philly. It was amazing! I definitely give it five stars...and we eat a lot of Indian food. We had the vegetable vindaloo and chicken tikka masala with tandoori roti. Everything was amazing and the service was great.  Highly recommend while in Montreal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Excellent service. Order the onion bagi."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Briyani and veg curry with naan. Both of them are too worst. Briyani had only turmeric and no spices. Too expensive too. Veg curry just had cabbage and few beans."}
{"text":"As an Englishman I'm guessing my Indian cuisine tasting is well above par considering it's rated as the UK national dish now. I have not had a Indian food in north America that really compares with the Ruby Room of Ayr, Scotland or many others I could mention.   This is not to say that I still don't love Indian food here and the search is still on to find that homely cuisine like bipins Indian temple. 8-)  The Gandhi is a good restaurant and the food is certainly enjoyable. I've been probably 4 times now. And only had bad service when I arrange a 12 person party there once in the mid week. Maybe they were caught out a little, But the cold food and slow service wasn't loved much by my party. alas it's really close to where I live and I'l certainly visit again."}
{"text":"I decided to give Gandhi a try very early (5pm early bird special) on a Sunday night and thought it was pretty great. They had just opened for dinner so it was fairly empty, but I've passed by several times and seen it full. The food was excellent. I had a veggie curry which tasted so fresh and spicy. My partner had duck tikka masala and although I am not a fan of duck, I tried the sauce and was excellent as well.   Read the reviews below about service issues, but didn't experience that at all. We had him all to ourselves though, so next time I go and it's busy I might update this. From the first experience the service was very friendly.  I highly recommend trying a special curry... amazingly good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Food was perfectly cooked and served - delicious. Service was wonderful - attentive and charming. Will probably go back in a couple days before we leave town. Grew up eating Indian/Pakistani food because my mom lived there, and this food was spot on."}
{"text":"The food was well prepared and tasty. Not over-cooked. Not over-spiced. Just right. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere food and service. Food took awhile to arrive but was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Had the saag paneer and aloo matter. Both were quite tasty and well made. Food took a while - but perhaps because the place was packed. Reservations recommended and also no high chairs if you have young children."}
{"text":"I've eaten Indian food all over the world and I loved this place.  On par with Cinnamon Club in London and Jyoti in NY/NJ area.  Duck tikka masala was amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow! I thought this looked really nice from the outside. When I saw the menu and was served a fresh pappadum, I was reassured. BUT, to my surprise, the service, food and management was incredibly poor. Ok, it was Sat. and very crowded, probably the reason we didn't get anything we ordered for 45 minutes...fine. When the food came. 2 main dishes weren't even put into the kitchen and two of us waited another 15 minutes. Ok, if the food was great, I would've let it go but not only was it over salted, under spiced, and un-authentic, the portions were a total joke!! I ended complaining to the manager and sarcastically he said it was our fault because we didn't have reservations...? He also said since I was a big guy, I was asking for larger portions...and we're lucky he let us eat there without reservations. Bottom line, this was truly one of the overall worst meals ever, and I've been to tons of Indian places...this was firstly a Bangladeshi joint hiding behind an Indian disguise, which happens a lot but doesn't show in the food quite like this did. Insulting to the taste buds and added I jury because the prices are up there."}
{"text":"Delicious and excellent service! My husband and I ordered one of the shared meals and a bottle of wine. We were so stuffed after the appetizers and shared entrees that we could hardly touch our desserts, and the wait staff was entertained by my husband's dogged determination to eat everything. Their naan and basmati rice are superb. The beef curry was flavorful, and it could have been a bit spicier, but that's my individual taste.   We arrived early on a weekend evening to a nearly empty restaurant, but most tables were in use and conversing loudly by the time we left. They had several areas set up for large reservations. The waiter said they are that busy every night during tourist season, but the weekday evenings are slower and quieter in the off-season.   Bathrooms were very clean and well-lit as well!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to have hsuan food in the heart of Montreal. The food is real good, very much adapted to the non-Indian palate while still feeling fresh and flavorful for the Indian palate. It's got parking nearby which helps a lot and the servers are very kind. We got the keema naan (great! Made with fermented dough, light and fluffy), chicken kadhai - it was ok, slightly overlooked chicken, but just only slightly and it didn't take away the taste.  The star was the mango chutney for me, which came along with the papad in the beginning of the meal and we made sure it stayed on the table for the rest of it as well. The shahi paneer was delicate and not op overpoweringly sweet or heavy. Gulab jamun wasn't true authentic, one could sense the French influence on the recipe, but it worked decently well"}
{"text":"Service was poor and inattentive - we had to call the waiters over everytime.  Chicken dish we ordered was really good, but the vegetable curry was truly awful and the veg biryani forgettable.  Ok at best, but quite honestly inexplicable why this restaurant has the rating it does."}
{"text":"Food = average Decor = above average Service = below average  Don't make a special trip, but if you can walk here from your hotel (as we did), it's an acceptable Indian meal.  NB  The okra dish was above average.  The okra was firm and recognisable, unlike the soggy (but often tasty) mess served at many Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"clean, casual environment  Good vegetarian food.  Works well for Western appetites as it is not highly spicy and has a subtle French-Montreal touch to the flavor.  Service started very good but declined when more tables were occupied."}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Jalfrezi, Baingan Bhartha, naan, raita, basmati rice.  The best Indian food I've had in a very long time.  The service and food lived up to all the reviews.  If you love Indian food make sure to stop here in Montreal.  Minutes from the Intercontinental Hotel"}
{"text":"First time ever eating Indian food here could not believe how good it was, the staff was great and answered all questions with grace and knowledge"}
{"text":"Good food but I have had better Indian food in other restaurants . Can't complain though . It was just ok though overall"}
{"text":"I went to this place on a Sunday afternoon for lunch when I was visiting Old Montreal with my family. To our surprise this place was closed and they did not put up their business hours. I checked with a shopkeeper next door who was equally confused and tried to call someone to verify whether this place is open for lunch. But no luck :(    So this is more of a question: what are the normal business hours of this place? Why don't they put up business hours?"}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment! We have been dining here for years, for the delicious food and friendly and superb service , every time we visit Montreal. This time the service was sub-par to say the least. I finally got up to pour water for the table; the portions have gotten smaller and -this is why I may not return - the rice was distributed scrooge-like: we ordered 8 dishes in our party of 7 and were brought one order  of rice.  \" we don't want to waste the portion\" was the waiter's take-me-aback response."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and one of the best Indian restaurants I've been too. The owner was oh so gracious and very accommodating. We will be back for sure and if Trump Wins in the U.S.A we will be asking to work in this fine establishment. Thank you Farouk for being so wonderful."}
{"text":"I've had better Indian food, especially for the price.  But, they are in the old port of Montreal, someone has to pay for that rent!  I've also had better service, the waiter was a real jack ass.  The guy I went with did not leave a tip due to the poor service, and the waiter followed us into the street accosting him for a tip.  I ordered saag paneer ($17), it tasted good but it arrived in small quantity, and the naan, while good is expensive at $4 per piece.   Note that they also close between lunch and dinner seating's.   I do not plan on returning to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Awesome food- exceeded our expectation.  Our favorite was chicken Pathi.  Naan was excellent!"}
{"text":"Gandhi was a great find! The most delicious  meal, we ordered the curry shrimp and mushroom sag. Service was most attentive. We will return When we return to Montréal!"}
{"text":"Our server was nice but it took over an over for the food to arrive. We ordered lamb biryani and two chicken dishes. The chicken dishes were ok, nothing memorable. The lamb biryanis were terrible. It was bland and traditionally biriyani comes accompanied with raita and pickle which this didn't. We were offered some mint yogurt substitute which just couldn't help the biriyani.   If you've ever had any type of real Indian food this place just doesn't live up to the reviews."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Montreal. I'm from NJ and know good Indian food! I've been to three Indian restaurants in Montreal this weekend and the service here is great. The waiters are very professional friendly and efficient. The food is delicious. Best kulcha I've ever had! Better than in India, so fluffy! We had a great time."}
{"text":"Nice Indian dining spot in Old Montreal although a bit pricy for the ordinary occasion. It's well-suited for corporate lunches or a business dinner.    It's a relaxed and charming environment which will make your dining experience enjoyable. I'm a big nan fan and didn't quite find that they had the winning formula, but overall, the food is descent.    If you're looking for Indian cuisine in the city centre or Old Montreal, this resto is one of the well-known choices for diners."}
{"text":"Looking for a location for a date night? This is a terrific choice for Indian food if you're in Old Montreal. The place is gorgeous, presentation is very well thought out, service is lovely. The food does take a little while to get to you but it's worth the wait - the dishes are cooked slowly but enjoy a few appetizers while you wait.    You'll enjoy your evening there and have great Indian food.     Wonderful curries,  a fabulous duck tikka masala, several delicious varieties of naan bread. Vegetarians and meat eaters alike will love the food."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Indian food I've ever had. As great as the food is as great the owner was. He was clearing tables, setting tables, talking with guests.... All wearing a suit and a smile. Such pride in one's work is becoming rarer and rarer to see. We had reservations at 6:30. By the time we left the restaurant got very loud. But don't let that stop you..... Go eat and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested to us by a local, and I am so glad! I loved the food and the atmosphere. Even my mother, who typically would turn up her nose to anything that ventures too far from steak and potatoes enjoyed her meal. This is definitely  restaurant I would return to in the future."}
{"text":"It was 5 pm on a Saturday and I was on the last leg of my long weekend trip to Montreal. I'd lingered in the old Montreal area all day, walked up an down the cobbled streets of Rue St Paul, admired the art work in the cute stores that stud the streets and I was famished. I was glancing at the menus of various restaurants trying to make up my mind, when a charming horse carriage pulled up nearby and a rather loud driver announced to her passengers that Gandhi was the best Indian Restaurant in town - that settled it.  After 30 minutes of shopping to fill my waiting time(!),  I returned when Gandhi opened for dinner and was surprised to see about 3-4 tables already occupied. I was dining alone, and appreciated that the staff let me pick my table. Gandhi has a very extensive menu and offers two portion sizes - something more restaraunts in the USA should emulate. As I was trying to pick my vegetarian dish, the place filled up remarkably quickly, and by about 6 pm, there was hardly an empty table in the main dining area!  I loved my mixed vegetable dish. It was spicier than I'd asked for, but fabulous anyway! A great mix of freshness, authentic flavor and hearty but not too heavy. The staff was friendly, courteous and asked me fewer questions than I expected! I enjoyed a great dinner, a good read and wrapped up what was a perfect weekend in one of my favorite cities."}
{"text":"This place continues to impress me. It is a must stop when I visit Montreal, and I swear the food and service gets better every single time. I had the pleasure of bringing my boyfriend here this trip. We had the onion bajhi, chicken tikka masala, Sag with onions, and eggplant. We also had traditional naan and basmati rice. Please do yourself a favor and eat here when you are in Montreal. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A gem in the streets of Old Montreal!  The owner Faruk is the best!   Service is unmatched and highly personal.  A beautiful location and ambience to match!  All the senses are turned on from the second you walk in.  Aromatic herbs and spices tantalize your sense of smell; Background music takes your subconscious to India; Eyes investigate and take in the beautiful and authentic artwork; Taste buds beg for more....from the homemade mango chutney (to die for) to the pakoras to the aloo ghobi and tandoori chicken....each dish outdoes one another!    Philadelphia (and south Jersey!) will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The delicious food was certainly worth the (longer than I would have liked) wait. Incredible samosas, tikka masala, and korma! Each dish had a wonderfully full flavor panel...some of the best Indian food I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great place. Smallish and casual but with amazing food and service.  I had the Grilled Cheese Goon which came on home made bread and loaded with cheese.   The home made jam surprised me as I basically had written it off as a garnish.  I was wrong!  I would eat this meal every day if my heart would allow it!  My wife had quiche which had an amazing crust. Kids had make and cheese with maple pork.   The serving sizes are big and meals are hearty.  This place should not be missed!"}
{"text":"Probablement un des meilleurs restaurant indien de Montréal... et aussi un des plus chers. L'ambiance et le décor sont très agréables. Pour quelque chose de plus abordable il faut aller dans mile-end. Mais pour impressionner la grande visite, c'est la place."}
{"text":"Iffy recently, but often very good Indian food.  This is not Indian food you would find in D.C., L.A. or Toronto, all of which are infinitely better in price/value and quality, but this is a solid Montreal Indian restaurant. Authentic spices, middle of the road portion size, wonderful naan! One item I would like to see on the menu is a lassi drink. And, a dosa in downtown Montreal would be very welcome. They make it spicy for you, and that's what I like when I have Indian food. The soup is also very good!  All this being said, I am downgrading this restaurant for 2105, as it appears as if they are phoning it in recently and the portion-to-value-to-quality has gone down in the past 12-14 months. What it has going is that it is convenient and the space of the restaurant appears more upscale than it's competition offering the same cuisine. If you are not a connoisseur of Indian food this is a fine option. If you are, you have been warned, i.e., do not get your hopes up. If you are looking for value, best to leave it alone altogether."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian restaurant.  Wonderful aromas and food to match.  Will come here again next trip."}
{"text":"While we were near Old Montreal, we decided to come here for dinner. Interior is very very nice and obviously nicer than most Indian restaurants. Service was pretty outstanding too. Unfortunately, the food didn't meet our expectations. I personally found the food to be pretty bland, even for a Indian restaurant that is obviously catering to a French-Canadian clientele. Mind you, this is after telling them to spice it up. Ending up dropping $150USD on a meal that didn't live up to hype."}
{"text":"We dined here early in the evening and they weren't very busy, so we did not have a service problem as many bad reviews seem to have had.  The food was very good and fresh, unlike a lot of Indian restaurants it wasn't a mashed up mess of food and sauce. The rice and breads were very good as well.   Overall, a nice clean restaurant with a great location in the Old City."}
{"text":"Once again, a totally amazing experience from start to finish! Food just as good as I remember it and service beyond compare! A must go to when in Montreal"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the music playing did not match the decor at all - they decided to play some 80s crappy Bollywood songs in a fine dining Indian rest. Really?  We ordered chicken madras and that made up for the bad food definitely! Hit the spot after having montreal's heavy french style food all week."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Indian food on nearly every continent in the world, and the food I ate here just may be the best Indian food I've ever had. The service started very strong but unfortunately wavered as more guests arrived. This stated, the quality of the food prevails; I recommend this restaurant to every one who enjoys Indian food. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. The butter chicken was fantastic as was the little deep fried onion ball thingys. I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am indian and am a HUGE snob when it comes to indian food since I grew up eating it every day. This was the best lamb biryani I've ever had. The meat was so soft and plentiful. Many indian places are cheap and pad the entree with veggies in place of the meat but not this place :)  The lamb was deliciously spiced and had no \"gamey\" flavor at all. I was pleasantly surprised when I took a bite and found pineapple in there! So strange but it worked to balance the other savory flavors of the dish. The pakoras were a bit tough and the galab jamun was mushy but the papadum was tasty as was the tandoori chicken we ordered. The waiter was super friendly and was responsive to our requests. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Très bon resto.  Un peu cher, mais cela vaut la peine. Plats parfaits pour partager.  Par contre, le service est nul!  Attente interminable pour la commande et les factures."}
{"text":"So we're strolling along the street and happen to go into a GP Boutique store during the Grand Prix weekend. When I asked if they had what I was looking for, the answer was 'no' so I asked the next logical question... 'where's good to eat around here?'  Now that was something she could help me with! Out came the phone to google map the restaurant name... huh, a 20 minute walk from where we were?   Let me tell you, it was with every step. I wish I could thank the young lady who suggested it to us because she was right, this place is fabulous!  We opted for the Chicken Kashmiri and som Aloo Gobi. It would seem that we try Aloo Gobi at every Indian restaurant we go to and this was one of the best!  The Chicken Kashmiri I could eat everyday for the rest of my life. Note to self: I want this to be my last meal! Must update Yelp profile info.   The Papadum was really good and the three sauces/chutneys were incredible. I believe they were mint, tamarind and mango. Absolutely to die for!!  Dear GP Boutique (on Saint Catherines Street) employee who recommended this restaurant to me... THANK YOU!!! You will never be forgotten."}
{"text":"Every restaurant that we remember offers at least one experience that stays with you. For Gandhi, it was our first visit there in December 2005, after a long journey to Montreal. It was late, we were tired and hungry, and worse, indecisive about dinner. But we were rewarded for our choice of Gandhi by wonderful Indian food and, I swear, the best naan I've ever had.  Experiences like that are the bane of diners - we go back trying to repeat them... in my case, trying to have that transcendent naan. I'm not sure it's happened, but in several visits since, we've been nothing but pleased by the delicious Indian food, and the capable, if aloof, service.  You can accuse restaurants in Old Montreal of offering only bottom-dollar tourist crap, and that charge sticks to a number of establishments. This isn't one of them. I saw one review from a few years ago that described the cuisine as \"British-Indian.\" It's appropriate for a menu that offers the range of dishes one expects from an Indian restaurant in North America - vindaloos, curries, biranyi, tandoori, bhajis, naan. I don't know true Indian food well enough to quibble about authenticity, but I can say that the flavors, to my palate, are calibrated and nicely balanced - and this seems to be part of the heart and soul of this precise cuisine.  Over a few visits, we came to believe that a request for spicy food would never result in a level of spiciness that we enjoy. But our last two visits in December 2007 convinced us that the kitchen can deliver the spice when called upon.  Desserts here taste pedestrian to me, but after eating as much as I do at Indian restaurants, it could be that I'm all tapped out, so if you've had good desserts here, say so and give some recommendations.  Gandhi expanded its space in 2007, approximately doubling the size of the restaurant. One feels less crowded in the dining room now; I've eaten there only once when the restaurant wasn't full or nearly so.  Gandhi is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I try to stray from giving negative reviews, but restaurant Gandhi in Old Montreal was truly a disappointment.  We came to restaurant Gandhi purely because my sister is a vegan and we read in Frommer's guide book that this place had vegetarian options.  VENUE:  The venue is lovely.  Spacious, classy, comfortable.  An overall lovely decor, really.  SERVICE:  Absolutely horrific.  Our waiter was quite nice and no one was nasty at any point, but the food took an absurdly long time to come out.  I like to consider myself patient and my threshold for reaching the boiling point before I get upset is quite high, but I sat in my chair for SO long waiting for food that my back started to hurt after awhile.  Not to mention, our orders were messed up and we were overcharged for food.  I'm not going to get into specifics because who really gives a shit, but it's just a display of truly poor service.  THE FOOD:  The food was quite good.   I ordered the Poulet au Beurre which is Chicken breast pieces, roasted and simmered in a creamy sauce.  The creamy sauce was a darkish red color and it was delightful.  The chicken was tender, moist and the sauce was a perfect, flavorful compliment without being overbearing.  My only complaint would be the dish was quite small, almost like an appetizer.  The other dishes were unmemorable like chana masala which is a classic Indian dish comprised of chickpeas and my sister noted that she had had much better and cheaper chana masala at other restaurants in NYC.  The highlight of the meal was the naan bread which delicious, but if the highlight of your meal is bread then something is wrong.  OVERALL:  In good conscience, I could honestly not recommend this restaurant based on how poor the service was.  It ruined the experience and reading some other reviews it seems restaurant Ghandi really needs to step their service up."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Montreal. Great service and excellent food. We had the shahi paneer and the onion kulcha."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner on Christmas Eve 2015. It was a wonderful experience with excellent food and very attentive service. They offered a prix fixe (Table d'Hote) allowing substitutions from their entire menu. We had main courses of lamb Vindaloo and tandoori mixed grill (after soup and mixed appetizers). Their naan was the best I've ever had: hot from the tandoor, uncut and fluffy. I was pleasantly surprised that they changed silverware with each course, something I never experienced in an Indian restaurant... The portions were generous and we ended taking leftovers to the Embassy Suites."}
{"text":"I'll summarize our experience by saying we had to wait for 70 (!!) minutes to get our food, which was a terrible experience given that we were with small kids that didn't have the patience (nor did we) to wait so long."}
{"text":"Wow, c'est un excellent restaurant Indien. Situé dans le vieux Montréal, un cachet unique, décoration simple et épurée, accueil chaleureux, service courtois et rapide. Si on ne connait rien à l'Indien, le menu pourrait vous semblez fastidieux, mais n'ayez pas peur de demander conseil sur les spécialités de l'endroit et vous risquez d'être agréablement surpris. Le prix pourrait faire peur à certain, mais la qualité de la nourriture en vaut largement la peine. Vos papilles risquent de vous inciter à y retourner. ;-)"}
{"text":"I guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60% full which can be understandable. But we were seated within 5 minutes, but the menus took another 5 minutes to come. I ordered the 4 course of salad, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, banana bread pudding, and a chai latte included in the end. Chicken was very tender and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree. Bread pudding very very good to finish. The gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side. Main entrees were a bit on the smaller side. The server was joking around a little, calling my chicken KFC when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard. Funny guy."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and there was plenty to eat. Everyone enjoyed the meal. But something to keep in mind: every Indian restaurant has their own recipe for a common dish, so it may taste a little different from what you expect. As far as the restaurant, our server was slow to come by and take our order and wasn't much help when it came to suggestions. And the food is prepared to order so it can take a while. But it was worth it. Even at the price (which was a little on the high side)."}
{"text":"An Indian restaurant in Old Montreal - you better be special and different. And this one lives up to the expectations. It's a notch above the other Indian restaurant (Taj) out there. I loved the white walls out there that adds to the ambience. The food is pretty good and the service is nice. The washrooms are clean and the service is good. Hands down, the best Indian restaurant in Montreal - it's quite pricey though!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this restaurant upon arriving in Montreal, beckoned inside by the warm, inviting aroma that spread about a block away from the restaurant. We tried the poulet tikka rejalla, a departure from traditional masala in that it was a little more tomato-y and included a strong mint component. This chicken has now set the bar for all other chicken, probably Indian or otherwise, that I have or will ever consume. It was truly divine. The restaurant was very pretty, with high ceilings and large windows. The service was fantastic and the owner even stopped to talk to us for a bit. Minus one star because the mattar paneer, while it tasted very fresh, didn't seem to be very flavorful. I almost wonder if this had something to do with the robust flavor of the rejalla, but I was expecting a bit more from the mattar paneer as one of my go-to dishes. I would DEFINITELY go back for the chicken!"}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant on our first night in Montreal. We ordered the Ghandi meal for two people and loved every part of it. As vegetarians who frequent Indian restaurants as an easy and usually delicious go-to, this restaurant was a hit. The ambience is wonderful, the service superb and the food absolutely delightful. We usually shy away from spinach dishes as they often end up being a version of creamed spinach that varies from ok to hard to eat. Their sag panir was nothing like that - it was the best we've ever had. Their rice pudding was also notable. Normally we don't have room for dessert at Indian restaurants, but I'm glad we did for their rice pudding - I highly recommend it. Overall great experience and we plan to go back before heading out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here a number of years ago and loved the food, it was awesome."}
{"text":"I expected more from a restaurant that claims to be Indian. I had no idea that French-canadians didn't like spicy food...however, Indian food is generally spicy and never bland. I felt like I was eating food that had no flavour. Now, I'm not expecting my tongue to burn off. But, I wasn't expecting the butter chicken that I ordered to taste so bland. I feel bad for all the people who visit expecting an authentic Indian cuisine. Also, the portions were awfully small for the price. It would have been fine, honestly, if the food didn't taste so bad. I love, love, love Indian food, and I felt so bitter when I left because I genuinely wanted a good meal.   I suppose if you prefer milder food, with less spice, you should go for this place. But don't expect any authenticity. Their food isn't real Indian food. It's catered for French-canadians who don't like spicy food.  The only reason I haven't brutally given this place a 1 star is because at least the waiters were kind enough to explain why their food was the way it was. They were informative and warm."}
{"text":"Waited one hour after being seated to be helped and receive a menu! Very disorganized and very slow service."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Chicago and went there by chance since we were walking on Rue St. Paul. We were very happy with our decision since the food was excellent, service was flawless and the general ambience was soothing. It apears to be popular since it was very busy on a sunday evening"}
{"text":"This is really good Indian restaurant in the Old Port area.  It's a very attractive atmosphere and service was excellent.  My wife had a very spicy lamb dish Agneau Tikka Jalfrezzi and was pleasantly surprised at how tender the lamb was.  I had the Poulet Tikka Rejalla which was delicious.  I also had the Mulligatawny Soup which was different than I've had before but good and we split a naan Peshawari which was sweet."}
{"text":"I always have dinner here when in town for a few days. Food is competent. Service is great."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Terrible.  10 minutes just to get water.  Much longer wait for first visit from waiter.  Endless waits for appetizers and main courses.  Food was fine when it finally arrived, but by then we were very unhappy and it didn't matter.  There are other Indian places in the Old a City, and many in other parts of town.  I'd recommend any of them, sight unseen, over this place."}
{"text":"Our last night in Montreal, we decided to dine at this restaurant.  We had already eaten at 'Darbar', where the food was outstanding.  So we were hoping for similar food experience at Gandhi.  We didn't make any reservation and arrived around 6:30ish on a Tuesday evening. The restaurant was empty and we were seated promptly.  We were given a papad each until we decided what to order.  We ordered the following: - Chana with Poori (Chickpea with fried bread):  This was ok, nothing spectacular.  The chickpea was not boiled properly and wasn't cooked properly with the spices and flavor.  When I had the chickpea on its own, it was bland. I had to mix it with the curry.  That is not how chickpeas should be.  The chickpea should be soft.  The curry was super oily, and my fingers were drenched in oil after I finished my meal.  The Poori was ok, nothing too great. - My husband ordered a chicken curry, and he felt that the chicken wasn't tender either.    We are Indians and obviously know what good Indian food tastes like.  I would choose 'Darbar' over 'Gandhi' any day. I had ordered the same dish at Darbar, and the chickpeas were super soft and flavorful.  We both left the restaurant feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  We paid around $50, but the food was not as satisfying.  My review of Darbar: http://www.yelp.com/biz/darbar-montr%C3%A9al?hrid=yHolKlGcY9g7gPJWDgutDA"}
{"text":"They did a great job accommodating all of my family's special needs. Excellent service, great food and great ambiance. Quick tip - when they say Spicy, they mean SPICY! :)"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've ever had; attentive but not intrusive service. I got the duck tikka masala which was my first try and I loved it! Tastes less buttery than what I've had in NYC and London."}
{"text":"I found this place not too long ago when I was wandering in the old port. The food is excellent, not overpriced. The chicken tikka is delicious and the naan bread is as good and fresh as you would expect. **Please don't be like me and think you can handle the \"extra spicy\". The server warned me, I didn't listen, he couldn't stop giggling at my reaction. **"}
{"text":"In my experience of eating Indian food in many North American cities Gandhi stands out. Excellent spicing. Excellent selection. Excellent service. Had the tandoori chicken, a cauliflower dish and spinach with potatoes. Mmmm. Had to take some home. It was equally good the next day. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and we really like it. I will say that their dishes run a bit on the sweet side so be prepared. But the flavors are great nonetheless. You can also ask for more spicy which seems to also mean less sweet if that's your preference.   The staff has been attentive and friendly each time. We will go back whenever we have a craving for Indian Food."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian meals we've had yet! Perfect food, with great friendly service. I've eaten Indian food all my life and have realised that finding GREAT Indian restaurants can be a challenge.  By recommendation of our waiter I ordered the Madras... and wow, it was nothing short of delicious with just the right amount of heat and absolutely bursting with flavour. The Chicken Saag was easily the best Saag we've had! Both were ordered with rice and Naan which accompanied our meals perfectly. At the end of the meal, our attentive waiter served hot towels for cleansing - nice touch. Pricing was totally reasonable for a top-quality restaurant such as this one.  If you want GREAT Indian food in Montreal, then you must check out Ghandi... enjoy!"}
{"text":"My bff swears that Gandhi is the best Indian food in North America, so this was our first meal stop when we got to Montreal. Despite the generic name, the food is excellent as was the service, and the restaurant is very pretty and bright.   We were starving and ordered several dishes to share: chicken jalfreezi, chicken tikka masala (my favorite), plain naan, and samosas. We asked for spicy levels for the two chicken entrees, and unlike their American counterparts they did NOT disappoint with the spice levels. I also noticed that American chicken tikka masala has always seemed cream-based to me, but at Gandhi it was definitely onion-and-tomato-based. While I lovelovelove and am more accustomed to the creamy-rich deliciousness of chicken tikka masala in the States, Gandhi's was very delicious. I also liked the jalfreezi. The samosas were good and I loved drizzling their array of sauces on the deep-fried lovelies. The naan was a little  too sweet for my preference, but the fluffy texture was wonderful.  I don't know when I will be back in Montreal again but I would definitely make Gandhi a sure stop and highly recommend it to any local or tourist."}
{"text":"On one hand, it took so long to get our food that two people got their food, ate, paid, and left before the other six of us got our food.  On the other hand, I'm pretty sure they made everything from scratch, which is a good sign.  Prices weren't so-so for the quality.  The sweet dishes were way too sweet."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! from start to finish the service was excellent. As the first time eating Indian cuisine, I was very happy eating at Gandhi. The Food came out quickly and the suggestions from the waiter was great.  This place is a must"}
{"text":"Gandhi exceeded my expectations many times over and delivered a flawless dining experience last night.  To begin with, the ambiance is total class.  White tablecloths and off-white walls, tastefully sparing much of the overdone decor found at most other Indian restaurants.  Nice dim lighting.  The waitstaff are some of the best ever.  They are well-staffed and they execute a great rotating system of attending to whatever is needed wherever, but without the confusion.  Their timing and attentiveness in service was absolutely perfect.  Bonus points for welcoming my four year-old daughter with a comped mango lassi.  Food- the tandoori chicken was the best I've ever eaten, period.  Great flavoring, so juicy, and cooked to perfection.  Comes with a nice salad.  Killer lamb vindaloo.  So good.  Nice garlic naan as well.  We finished with a frozen mango sorbet type of dessert.  Really awesome and I loved the texture.  Go to Gandhi next time you're in Montreal.  It is unforgettable."}
{"text":"If you need an Indian food fix, this is a great place. Food is very good. Service as well is great. Ambiance is calm and relaxing. I suggest trying:  Butter chicken (obviously) Tikka masala (chicken: my favorite) Bryani Rice with veggies   Regular Naan is amazing but try the Naan onion and Naan garlic.  Lamb kadhai Chicken Vandaloo (ultra spicy!!) Rogash(lamb)  Mango Lassi is like some sort of smoothie. Good to balance from the spicy  stuff."}
{"text":"Our family of five had a lovely dinner here. The samosas were a big hit and the tikka masala delicious. The service was sometimes a tad slow, but it was packed on a Saturday night so it's understandable. And everyone was very kind, very helpful. We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal I will often have at least one of my meals here.  The food is quite good and it is a very pleasant atmosphere.  Good service.  Relatively quiet.  Nice dining room. I have never had a bad meal.  I mostly order the curries.  Don't think I've sampled the Tandoor items other than the naan.  On my favorites in the greater St. Paul zone."}
{"text":"Yes, it really is that good! This is a small restaurant with a great, elegant atmosphere, and very reasonable prices. Order one of the Table d'Hote options for the best value. The service was amazing, I swear if they could feed you they would.  I tried to pour myself a glass of wine from the bottle at the side of our table and out of nowhere a server appeared to do it for me.  He apologized for not being there sooner and seemed horrified that we would have to pour our wine ourselves.  Food portions were large but not huge.  I ordered the lamb which absolutely melted in my mouth.  \"A\" ordered a spicy chicken dish which was just amazing.  We both asked for medium spicy.  The spice level was perfect.  Just spicy enough to light up your mouth, but not spicy enough to drain your sinuses.  The flavors of the food and quality that went into the presentation were obvious. Not sure what some other reviews experienced because you missed out big time.  This was a great find and one of our favorite meals of the trip.  We did the Table d'Hote option with a bottle of wine, extra order of naan and with tip, taxes, and service charge for around $120."}
{"text":"Two stars for the food only.  Decor is great, it's a great space.  Service was excellent and attentive.  I have never had such sweet indian food.  Mint Chutney and Chicken Tikka Masal were SWEET.  Very weird.  The onion naan was excellent though.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"We got to Restaurant Gandhi minutes before their kitchen was to close but the staff was very welcoming.  Before our order came out they brought us some papadum with three chutneys.  I tried the mango and the tamarind ones and they were really good.  My somosas were a little dissapointing but edible.  My husband pakora was good.  I had some sag paneer that was not the best I've had but it was satisfactory and I forget what else my husband ordered but he was happy enough. While this is not the best Indian restaurant I've been to it was good enough and the service was top-notch.  I'm sure I will return."}
