{"text":"The only reason I gave 1 star is that at least a star to write a review?BRING THE ONE YOU HATE THERE HAVING DINNER .  Absolutefuckingly do not recommend, PERIOD."}
{"text":"Okay, long story short, a bunch of us missed a flight at Calgary and we decided to make use of an extra day there. This place has a lot of reviews and so, we decided to give it a try. We were there late by dim sum hours ~ 2pm - 3pm, and so there are less choices on wheels. Their menu orders don't take very long though. The food is a pleasant surprise. I would rate them among the finer Cantonese dim sum places, by NYC standards. (Of course by Guangzhou standards they are a bit old-schooled) One of us is from the Cantonese area, and she likes it as well."}
{"text":"I heart dim sum. The first time I had it was only a year ago....*gasp* ..i know I know ...i lived under a rock as a child SORRY!   I went with some girlfriends from work along with our language barrier breaking friend. I would just tell her what I wanted in English and she would wave her hand and quickly rattle off what I asked for...heaven!. She was a life saver that's for sure.   I still don't know what half of the items are called but I do know its all amazing!   We would usually go at lunch time and it would always be full when we walked in with more people standing at the door patiently waiting. I'd recommend making a reservation!   The ladies roll their carts of goodies around the floor and ask each table if they would like some. They come on small plates that can be easily shared using the Lazy Susan in the middle of the table.   I love love love their shrimp toast. It is very rich and you can only eat a couple but they are delish!   The prices are good, its always really reasonable when we come with a large group. I have never gone there for anything but dim sum so I'm not sure what their menu entails.   Even if you don't speak Cantonese or mandarin you can still get along just fine, the ladies always have somebody to translate amongst the staff.   Its a great experience to have and there is so much to choose from you have to try it out!"}
{"text":"I was here for dinner recently - the food was really good. I highly recommend the ginger chicken and the asian greens in oyster sauce. The cashew chicken dish we ordered had very little chicken and the vegetables were chopped fairly small that only a spoon was suitable - unless you used chop sticks to eat the small pieces of green pepper one by one. I did not mind the price of the food as it was much better than most Chinese restaurants in Calgary.   My main issue that night was a man seated a table not too far from us and was making Skype or FaceTime calls on his iPad without ear phones to multiple people. He was not eating while we were there. The host went over to him -  I thought he was going to ask him to be more respectful of people who were actually eating - but I have a feeling he was either staff or a regular, because the host chatted with him on several occasions between calls."}
{"text":"This restaurant continually gets a readers' choice award in a local Calgary newspaper each and every year. However, I must ask those who praise it, have you tried any of the other delights in the area or elsewhere in the city. Do not misinterpret me, I have enjoyed the meals I have eaten at Silver Dragon thoroughly, but there are others nearby and far away that eclipse them in quality and some in price. I find the food somewhat, but not totally, westernized.  Regardless of my own quirky tastes, nobody who eats here is going to be disappointed. It is classy enough for a first night out date. The Chinese restaurants that I would give five stars to are anything but classy except for a few. Local five stars for me include the U and Me, the Happy Valley, and the Harbour City. Local four stars include the Golden Inn and the Gee Gong.  For me the finest dim sum in Calgary is at the T.Pot China Bistro at 9650 Harvest Hills right next to TnT."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the silver dragon on Tuesday. Food was good. Service staff were very good. Had to wait a little while for our food but not too long. All staff were very friendly and polite. Prices are in line with other Chinese restaurants. Ambiance was good."}
{"text":"My visit to Silver Dragon was on a late Friday night and we chose it because, well, it was one of the only places left that was open and probably wouldn't have had a ton of obnoxious drunk people to contend with. Lo and behold, I was right. The first thing I noticed was how different silver dragon is from the other Chinese restaurants I've visited. We were greeted warmly and our server wore a classy, if not retro Vegas-y uniform. We were given water immediately and a few minutes later our order was taken. Our table shared the salt and pepper squid, the veggie chow mein and stir fried veg.  The S&P squid was decent. Instead of bing spiced with hot pepper flakes it came served under jalape√±o peppers and onions. The squid was crunchy but lacked any saltiness. The noodles and veg were pretty standard too, but I swear our veg was cooked in GASP!  . . . Butter!  Despite the fact we were the only table left when we were at the end of our meal, no one gave us the stank eye to  encourage us to leave. They gave us the bill when we asked for it."}
{"text":"Food was DELICIOUS and the waitstaff quick but the bartending (done by waiter) was HORRIBLE.  Ordered a mai-tai (first mistake) and was brought a green drink, cut with Mountain Dew, I sent it back and drank water, all the while the waiter insisted it was a MaiTai....  Anyway, food was delish.  Did I say how good the food is?"}
{"text":"I took the family and friends to Silver Dragon for dinner last weekend and had a great meal. I use to eat here often in the 80's and for convenience have been eating at local Chinese restaurants in the burbs...my loss!  The service was very good and the food was fresh, hot & flavourful. The prices may be a little higher than I am use to but, as they say, you get what you pay for! Extensive menu makes choosing difficult but the waiter was helpful.   We are looking forward to our next meal here!"}
{"text":"I am not a Chinese food connoisseur, but I'm going to venture to say, that this is the best Chinese food in town. Service is ok, kind of basic, but they are polite. I know where I'm going to be going whenever I get Chinese food cravings :)"}
{"text":"There's a reason they didn't name it Gold Dragon, because it ain't the best dim sum place in Calgary, the food here seems subpar and the service is standard, been eating dim sum since I was born and this place just let me down, sorry silver dragon"}
{"text":"Really amazing authentic food.  Would have five stars but the place was very loud and there was some ordering confusion.  All worked out in the end.  Would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Had not been to the Silver Dragon in years, but we went at the invitation of our travel agent and friend. There were 7 of us which allowed us to get a good mix of dishes. Our host also ordered a special noodle dish (her favourite) with black bean sauce, and Peking duck, which was amazing.  Always fun to be here. Lots of families and a great mix of folks. The food is consistent.  Classic Chinatown!  Atmosphere ***** Service **** Food ****"}
{"text":"Well I have been coming here for years for dim sum an it's always been great  an great service  but today I can't say that it seemed like cause we were not Asian that some things they dint even offer us all the dishes that were more of Asian culture we has to ask for  not to impressed"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal and liked that all four of out dishes came at the same time. The ginger chicken is a family favorite.  This is our first choice for Chinese food in Calgary. Although not as good as Golden Dragon in Red Deer, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was very fresh and the sauces were light.  We had a waiter that was as bland as white bread and the service was mediocre.  Big dining room, not much charm.   Think it would be fun with a group ... Not good for two."}
{"text":"Food with amazingly quick delivery to my apartment door. Delivery was more of the pleasure when having silver dragon."}
{"text":"Did not take any photos as the Food was delicious. Interesting environment, food carts zipping around. The only thing was that there was no real service and we ordered a few things of the menu, which took a very long time. Overall I will be back."}
{"text":"Solid 4-star Chinese....have yet to find a 5-star but I guess I'm picky considering I lived in Asia for 2 years.  I've been here for the Dimsum and it was awesome but I just recently went for dinner.  We ordered the dinner for 4 for 3 of us and it was more than enough...but a bit pricey at $80.  The almond chicken was my favorite because ive had better ginger beef at several other places. If I lived close I'd probably hit it more, but I'll probably just go back for DimSum if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant. It's upstairs and very good price and very nice interior. We got the sizziling rice, ma pa tofu, and tofu balls. Everything was really good and we had great service, from the host at the door, to the waiters. I am defiantly going to back here when I am back in Calgary. I'm a vegetarian and they have a decent selection of vegetarian options, compared to the other Chinese restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"My favourite dim sum spot in calgary.  Great variety and good food.  So far I've tried a different type of dumpling every time and I have been coming here for awhile."}
{"text":"great customer service. food is little better than other chinese restaurant. price is not bad :) will go back"}
{"text":"I'm back at Silver Dragon.  This time it's for dim sum (yum cha).    The heart of Silver Dragon is its dim sum.  Conducted in a traditional fashion, carts of fresh tapas-sized dishes roll out from the kitchen in a uniformed parade.  There are two seatings (11am and 1pm) for dim sum, and the general rule is that if you can arrive before these times you'll have first picks on the popular dishes like ha gow (shrimp dumpling) and sui mai (pork dumpling).    I've been eating dim sum in many parts of the world, and one personal guide that I use to gauge the quality of the restaurant is to ask if there is a dish called \"ha doast-ee\"  (shrimp on toast) on the menu.  It's rarely served (maybe during Chinese New Years) or included in the menu--an indication of how special this dish is. To my surprise, the waitress  delivers this exceptional dish to our table; I am in heaven and the rest of the table approves.    There are many variations of the shrimp toast. My favourite is a shrimp mixture in a creamy sauce set on top of a hard toast point.  At Silver Dragon it's like a shrimp ball fried in a breaded mixture (almost identical to the dish served at The Jumbo Floating Restaurant in Aberdeen, Hong Kong). It's good so try it out, and ask for a red vinaigrette dipping sauce too.    The rest of the dishes ordered are just as stellar, fresh, not too greasy, and well crafted and prepared.  For example, is the famous Mainland/Mandarin style dish \"xiao long bao\" (Shanghai soup dumpling).  Unlike other dumplings, this one explodes with hot won ton flavoured broth with chicken and pork (be careful and let the dumplings sit before you devour it). It takes an experienced and highly skilled chef to make these dumplings without it breaking apart-- just the time and effort alone adds depth and appreciation to the dining experience.  Like Peter A's post, it does help to have a \"bona fide Chinese friend\" to describe or order foods off the menu.  However, like all great food explorers, observing others (discretely of course) and asking questions is helpful and perfectly acceptable.  The dim sum atmosphere encourages you to engage and participate. Eating exotic food is essential to learning and living in one's cultural and regional space. So check out Calgary's Silver Dragon for dim sum on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about this place, and folks had suggested I go there for \"great Chinese food in Calgary\".  Seeing that Silver Dragon is located in the heart of China Town, I had such high hopes.  But I really cannot even say that the meal was okay.  Certain elements were okay, and a few even good, but overall, it was not worth the time or money we spent.  And I regret our decision to waste one of our few meals in Calgary at this restaurant.  First, the good aspects:  the vegetable dumplings we ordered as an appetizer gave us high hopes for the meal.  They were huge!  And delicious.  And grilled to perfection. The sauces they were served with were nothing special, but the dumplings on their own were so nice, I really didn't need a sauce.  Now, the okay:  the eggplant dish was fine.  It was tasty, though not particularly memorable.  A little soy sauce and chili sauce perked it up a bit.  But I really feel as if the chef should be creating the sauces, not me.  Finally, the bad:  the scallops and tofu in black bean sauce was abysmal.  Sure, tofu on it's own has no really distinct flavour.  But anyone who has ever cooked tofu knows it absorbs the flavours around it.  So I was greatly disappointed when I took a bite of tofu and it still has absolutely no flavour.  The black bean sauce was so bland that my Norwegian partner commented that he makes a better black bean sauce, and you know what?  He does!  I have never had a black bean sauce with no depth of flavour.  No seasoning at all.  And no amount of soy sauce or chili sauce could redeem this dish.  We did take the leftover eggplant and dumplings home with us, but we left over 2/3 of the scallop dish right there on the table.  We just couldn't eat it.  And believe me, we are NOT picky eaters.  If you are in Calgary's China Town, I urge you to skip the fancier decor of Silver Dragon and head next door to the run down Happy Valley.  The food there is outstanding and the service is much more attentive than the overpriced Silver Dragon."}
{"text":"This was my first dim sum experience in Calgary (and only the second of my life, unless you count some great pork buns last month at the Manila Airport). So I'm definitely not claiming to wear any dim sum expertise crowns, but it's in my top two!  First of all, grab at least seven other friends and make a booking or you'll end up stuck in the line down the stairs. And take at least one other friend that DOES know their dim sum and can order for you or at least help you identify what's going past you on the carts. And if you can, sit near the kitchen at the back and the food will be super fresh.  I enjoyed the experience and while most of the time I had no idea what i was eating to make recommendations, my enjoyment level was always within the average to really good range. Our tea was constantly refilled and they just mark off your chosen plates on the table's card as you go.  The best part? All in (including LOTS of food, tax and tip), it worked out to be $22.50 per person."}
{"text":"By far the best hot and sour soup I've ever had. Main dish was just average. Very clean, but service was a little fast (our main dish came before we had 3 spoons of soup)."}
{"text":"Oldschool classic place, nothing here is all that standout, but this is Calgary Chinese in a nutshell. There isn't much better around the city, so you can't really ding them too badly.   The service was terrible, but the food was decent."}
{"text":"Please note that I only came here for dim sum and have never ate from the menu.  The entrance to this restaurant is met with 2 flights of stairs, and as far as I know there's no access for disability.  I liked the atmosphere, calm, relaxing background music, and clean.  We ordered hagao, siu mai, and lo mai gai. All of them were tasty and filled my stomach real fast.  A great stop for a quick dim sum eat and it didn't cost a lot. I would highly recommend to come in early especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly poor experience given all the great reviews. Came in, ordered from the menu, then the kitchen took a very very long time with the food"}
{"text":"Food was good, took to go. A little pricey for what I got (seafood chow fun) Normally 10 dollars, paid almost double. Satisfied a hankering. I heard that U & Me Restaurant a block over is awesome. They were closed for renovation when I tried to go. Not many options open in \"Chinatown\" after hours."}
{"text":"Our new favourite dim sum hangout. Carts are plentiful and filled with a wide variety of dim sum favourites as well as unusual items. Everything is super fresh and arrives at the table piping hot. If you are lucky, they even have soup dumplings on the carts occasionally. There are often line ups on the weekend but they usually go through them pretty fast."}
{"text":"Steamed fresh fish is super good!!! Egg roll looked different from what I had ever seen."}
{"text":"K always enjoy the push cart yamcha style. Lots of good stuff here. Big portions n really friendly ppl here. Its a china town classic. U gotta come here!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Chinese restaurants in Calgary!  With over 200 menu items available, all of which are expertly prepared by the 15 Chefs on-site, Silver Dragon is as good as it gets.  For someone who had never tried Dim Sum, this was the perfect place to have my very first experience. They had a ton of variety, as well as THE best hot and sour soup I have had in town! Plus I'm told that their ginger beef cannot be paralleled. You'll have to try it and let me know what you think.  The service was efficient and insanely quick, and the prices were extremely reasonable.  No complaints here, just a whole lotta eatin' ;)"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here. They speak Cantonese to our friends and offered fresh steam ling cod by the pound. Fish was excellent.  Apple pear soup very good. Also pea shoots good, Buddhist vegetable good, salt pepper ribs tough, roast duck tougher than ribs, . Nice decor. Excellent service for dinner with few customers. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"After an evening of celebrations at Telus Spark/Beakerhead, we wrapped up our evening with a late dinner at the Silver Dragon. Amongst friends, this place is also known as home of the \"crack fish\"...fish so delicious that it barely makes it one round of the table and it is all gone. I can hear Captain Jack Sparrow saying \"why is the fish always gone?\" after sampling this delicate delight.  What makes this fish so special, you ask? Let me start with a batter so light, it melts in your mouth. Yes, it's fried but it is never greasy or tough. The sauce, oh the sauce...yes, the sauce...mmm...the fish is tossed in this lovely, sauce that isn't too sweet, isn't too salty or sticky. It's just like something out of Goldilocks and the Three Bears - it's just right. The proper name for this dish, of course, is Golden Soy Sauce Fish.   So, did we order anything else? We sure did, and we enjoyed every bite. However, the fish, oh the fish...yes, the fish was epic!"}
{"text":"Favorite Dim Sum place downtown. Food is always fresh and they have a large selection of dishes on carts. Service is always good and staff is always very friendly. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"As I crossed the border to Canada, the immigration staff asked my destination. He recommended the Silver Dragon for Chinese food in Calgary.  All in all, it was OK.  Potstickers were large, crisp on on side, and yummy. Noodles had barbecue pork, ginger and low mein.  Mongolian beef had curry sauce and the egg plant had minced pork."}
{"text":"Good fast dim sum cart service. Actually can get someones attention for requesting pop, water, sauces or ordering off menu.   Love that they do reservations on the weekend for groups of 8 and over.  Also noticed that every time we have come, there is a couple different dishes coming out of the kitchen which helps us change things up to try something new. Haven't had a bad dish here yet."}
{"text":"We ordered a set dinner for 4 but we actually had two persons. Four dishes plus soup of the day. The only acceptable dish was the soup, the vegetable dish is just too plain, the fish was deep fried with too much sidedish on top. The sweet and sour prawns was ok but the soy sauce chicken was terrible, not fresh and so dried that we can hardly taste anything. Strangely, we counted that there were 25 tables that night and all customers were non-Asian. We were the only (2 of us) asian customers in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good dim sum but a little more expensive and less options than what we are used to in the states."}
{"text":"This place has been  Around for a while...ordinary food.....had steamed fish and it was very poorly done, maybe not fresh.... Other dishes were  just ok......same style,clovers, and maybe chef from 20 years ago.... Decent service, although I think there main goal is to get u out in under 1 hour, I haven't been here in some time, and won't go back, there has to be better around!"}
{"text":"Food was nothing special, I actually regretted of not staying home and cooking dinner myself. Szechuan chicken not spicy at all. Veggies were just horrible."}
{"text":"It has been several years since I ate here. Last time it was lunch and all dim sum. It was outstanding. This time I had fried shrimp, scallops and calamari, spring roll and Peking duck. WOW! Is all I can say, again this restaurant did not disappoint! Fresh, crispy and delicious. As good as the last time."}
{"text":"great food, fast service, and buffet is larg and lots of varitys."}
{"text":"Want Chinese at your door in less than 30 minutes..call Silver Dragon.  They don't promise it but they've never take any longer than that with my order.  Their food is great and there's plenty off it, so much so you'll be eating it for a couple of days afterwards.  I recently had some family and friends visit from Europe and treated them to takeout one of the nights.  They still talk about how good it was and wish they had a Chinese that did a Spicy Shredded Pork as good as Silver Dragon.  Definitely a fan :)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but I must say that it is just okay and after living here the last two years, i give up on finding a decent chinese restaurant.  I am super picky being raised in a traditional chinese family. I grade based on three elements: quality, taste,and importantly authenticity!  My order consist of: mongolian beef, egg drop soup, cashew nut chicken, bok choy with black mushrooms( by request).  First the soup: it was very good. My only complaint is the consistency. I like cornstarch in my soup to add thickness, but otherwise it was prepared well.  Next the bok choy with black mushrooms: very good as well with nice crisp bok choy and large black mushroom. Brown sauce was also prepared well.  Now the cashew nut chicken: this is where they fail and are a rip off! Barely any chicken and all veggies. To all you non- asian people! A meat dish should be prepared with all meat and not filled with crap veggies.... Thats where asians are ripping you off. Tis was filled with celery, red bell peppers,etc! The sauce was tasty and good.  Lastly, the mongolian beef: the worst! It wasnt even mongolian beef rather chinese yellow curry beef.   I honestly think they just made a mistake.  As my father would alway say to me, eat all your meat! The rice and veggies are cheap compare to the meat. Aso i didnt see many asians dining here, a clear sign."}
{"text":"Very good! Had an early dinner there, and was impressed. There was two of us and we ordered the shrimp toast (which was okay..), egg rolls (which are homemade, huge, and tasty), crispy ginger beef (very tasty) and BBQ Pork lo mein (so. absolutely. delicious). I ate too much lo mein, and we had a bunch of leftovers to take home.  The ginger beef didn't come with any sides or rice. But we had plenty of food anyway. Service was efficient and pleasant, and price was reasonable.  Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Once again, Chinese food in Calgary is way better here than back home. Silver Dragon is a fancier chinese restaurant with authentic food. My coworker ordered in Cantonese so I can't tell you what we got but see the picture I'm attaching for an idea."}
{"text":"Dim Sum at the Silver Dragon is amazing. I have been there a few times on special occasions, and I must say that the food is excellent.   The shrimp balls are delicious. They are cooked to perfection and are tasty, as are many of the other dishes. It's been awhile since I went there, since I no longer live in Alberta, but I have great memories of dinning there with my friend. I also love the mango pudding for desert. While I enjoy it without milk, I'm sure it's great either way.  We were always so excited when we got to sit down. The place is usually packed on Sundays with people lined up on the round staircase that leads to the second floor. However, it is SO worth the wait. The price is reasonable too, and while it is a relatively large restaurant, the service and attention to detail is very good. Truly a gem in the heart of Calgary's Chinatown. You rock Silver Dragon. 5 stars all the way baby!!!"}
{"text":"We always come here for Chinese food. All of their food is absolutely delicious! They have big portion sizes, and very reasonable prices. They have all kinds of options.   The ambience here is nice, and the bathrooms are clean, but not as nicely put together.    The service here is not 'to die for' but it is overall pretty good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has by far the worst of the worst customer service ever!!! I'm Chinese, and go to a lot of Chinese restaurants, and work in a night club as a bartender, so I know how the customer service industry works, we sat there and waited for 20mins until I had to wave someone down to get service, then he got our order and was super rude when I asked him a simple question of what something was, instead of answering my question and explaining simplicity, he looked at me like I was a child and walked away. I will never step foot into this place again! And I advice everyone else not to either!!"}
{"text":"Secret hint: come around 115-130. Most of the traffic will have died down and you can request the servers for specific dim sum and they make it fresh. I think that's what made this an over the top experience.  We got har gow, cheong fun, shumai, lo bak go and ham sui gok.  Lo bak go is crisp and turnipy. Har gow is pretty standard. Char siu cheong fun I would personally not get again - the pork doesn't quite taste like char siu.  But man, the shumai and ham sui gok is where it's at. Perhaps its because we got it fresh, but the ham sui gok came straight out of the fryer, crisp yet chewy and glutinous - maybe a bit more filling would be nice, but its so good, who cares? And the shumai is the best - lots of pork, delicate wrapper - super juicy, nice spring to it - my wife said it was one of the top best things she's ever eaten.  it's a bit on the pricier side for dim sum, but if you're willing to pay, its definitely a nice place to go."}
{"text":"Awesome dim sum and good service for a Chinese restaurant. Always a line on weekends. Come early to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have ever had literally threw up right after. Over priced greasy and simply gross."}
{"text":"Sigh. What a bland place. On all counts.  Perhaps dim sum just doesn't do it for me, but I'm pretty sure that my issue with the food was that, although it was objectively okay, it had an objectively low flavour content.  Almost worst for me was the dim sum service; the service was as convenient as a buffet and just as charming. Again, perhaps this is how it should be, but the servers didn't even pretend to care what we might find interesting. They were not in the least bit interested in making suggestions. Whatever. They didn't care. I don't care.  The space is huge though. I bet they can fit a million people here. So there's that I guess.  Oh, and the tea was excellent (even if tied to the teapot with a plastic tie). Yes, the tea. If I visit Silver Dragon again, I'll take the yum cha, hold the food."}
{"text":"Great chinese food.  Enjoy the ginger chicken, and most items on the menu.  Very consistent!  I like the fishtank that you see when you walk up the stairs."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of Dim Sum!!! Silver Dragon why did I have to find you so close to the end of my time in Calgary?  Finding the time to schedule a final Dim Sum feast with R wasn't easy, we could only come up with a weekday time and after asking for some Yelper's input (thanks all!) we decided to try Silver Dragon. We arrived shortly after 11 as we had read that it can get busy and we were immediately taken to a table.   We had our tea, our water, our chopsticks and our appetites... And then we had Dim Sum! The carts started to make the rounds pretty quickly and there was so much selection! Every dish was piping hot and there was nothing that we didn't like. The best part was the abundance of items that I have not seen at other places. We had shrimp balls, taro dumplings, shrimp toasts (these were to DIE for), Gai Bao (chicken buns) and a few other things. It was all delicious and of course there were lots of left-overs.   If I am only comparing Dim Sum then I think I have to say it's the best in Calgary. My usual favourite has some AMAZING non DS dishes which is the reason we usually go there. When it comes to Dim Sum I will have to hail the new ruler........ Silver Dragon!"}
{"text":"Great memories of dim sum. Been a long time. Still very delicious. Great selection and cart pushing too."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here for lunch and we had the following:  Shrimp Dumplings ($5.50) Pork Dumplings ($5.50) Chive Dumplings ($5.15) Beef Rice Flour Rolls ($5.15) Radish Cake ($4.50) Water Chestnut Cake ($4.15)  Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gao) are pretty much the hallmark of dim sum. Theywere unsatisfying here. While the shrimp balls were juicy, the skin of the dumpling was mushy and lacked a chewy texture.   The Pork Dumplings (Siu Mai) were also disappointing. The pork filling tasted old and lacked a fresh feeling in each bite. They certainly looked the part though.   The Chive Dumplings (Gao Choy Gao) were the best out of the three dumpling dishes we had. These were juicy, full of shrimp and chive, and this time the skin had a chewy texture that made eating the dumplings exciting.  The Beef Rice Flour Rolls (Ngao Yook Cheung Fun) were disappointing in that the skin was mushy and the beef inside had too much of a bitter aftertasteassociated. It was around this time I began to feel our table was getting a lot of lukewarm dishes and the kitchen was just trying to offload dishes it couldn't during the lunch rush.  The Radish Cake we ordered straight from the kitchen and these were amazing. Super fluffy but with the right amount of oil and flavour is how I like my Radish Cake and the restaurant delivered. These went great with the vinegar and we ended up having two orders.  The Water Chestnut Cake is a dessert that looks like a kind of jello. It was a mix of jello and nut in the taste department and while it's not something I'd try again, my mom loved it, so it's worth a try if you are interested in hot Chinese desserts."}
{"text":"I have to give it to this place that it still gets so much business. The food is unimpressive and bland, and the scorn of all Chinese families I know. The prices were hiked up even before the economic downturn. Not worth.The flavor of the dimsum is completely warped to meld with Western tastebuds - and I do hold that it isn't what it used to be. My family has been here enough times and we've left each time disappointed. The servers are so used to pampering white clientele that we are treated with an offhand attitude just by our faces and our language - as if as Chinese people we should KNOW to expect subpar service. This attitude is disgraceful and I feel no cultural connection with this restaurant whatsoever. The only attraction is its decorative value and relative cleanliness."}
{"text":"Went to Silver Dragon on a Sunday late morning. What to eat after a night out? Dim sum of course!  Anyways, I have been here before and this place still is great. Love how the dim sum cart pushes were all dressed up in their best Stampedey attire. Awesome!   Food was great. We ordered a ton of dishes (check out my other review if you want to see) but we essentially ordered the usual dim sum affair with a few new dishes. Four people for around $60 - totally worth it.  Warning - huge lineup down the stairwell when we left so make sure you get their early enough or you will have to wait!"}
{"text":"My husband's family has been coming here for many many years. I finally went with them for the first time. The food was excellent. So was the Jasmine tea. The service was not great and our food took forever to arrive, although we were a larger party and ordered a ton of food. We would have preferred if they brought things out as they were ready instead of bringing it all at once, especially as it is served family style.  Another problem we had is the air conditioning was blasting and our entire table was like a refrigerator. When we asked if they could adjust it we were told that it wouldn't be polite to the other guests, even though we were the only ones mentioning the temperature. Not cool."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in Chinatown, hear it's been an institution here, so pretty well explains their customer service.  Decor is up to par w/ the ones back home actually, wedding banquet style.  But the food's blah.  Dim sum---it's tough to compete with Vancouver/Richmond, but seriously, if I lived here, this wouldn't be a regular weekly thing.  Shrimp dumplings skin wasn't delicate, for starters.  However, it's the attitude shown by a server, almost like annoying him to ask for napkins, XO sauce."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for dim sum in so many years I've completely forgotten about the restaurant itself!! I thought gone were the days that dim sum carts were pushed from table to table. Nope. Not here! (Though I honestly hate them now because they're never stocked with freshly cooked items and they take forever to get to your table when you're completely famished!!!) We got a little bit of everything. Shiu mai, ribs, and the likes. They didn't seem to have the lotus wrapped rice that my son only eats from dim sum. The shiu mai was a bit on the sweet side. I can't recall anything memorable besides finding parking in Chinatown on a weekend was next to impossible. I don't know if it is worth it to come here when the experience is nothing like it was when I was a kid. It used to be the best place in Calgary for dim sum. I really don't find that's the case anymore."}
{"text":"Wow, is this place ever busy on a Sunday afternoon !  We had Dim Sum. It was my first time, and it was excellent.  I love this place.  We shared a whole bunch of things, and everyone of them was most delicious .  The service was great.  I did not pay the bill, so I have no idea how expensive or inexpensive it was.  But, the place was packed to the rafters !  So that is a very good sign.  Sure hope to come back one day ."}
{"text":"This used to be my families go-to spot when we moved here from Toronto but I haven't been back for years, mostly due to the sketchy reviews it's received lately from people.  Tonight's dinner was very good.  We had the veggie chow main and the Buddhist bowl.  Both of these dishes were well executed with a variety of mushrooms, snow peas, and other crisp veggies.  Glad it's still awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a place you come for food and not so much for the service, especially during the busy dinner rush.  We arrived and waited a few minutes as the host wasn't to be seen.  We were seated by the foyer and found the restaurant a bit noisy for a Saturday evening.  The waitress came to bring us water and plates with forks and knives.  I was glad she also brought us bowls with chopsticks later.  Although it wasn't on the menu, we were able to order fish congee and gai lan plain with no meat, and also ordered beef and green peppers with black bean sauce and chow fun.   The congee arrived first and it was a huge bowl. We consumed about 4-5 bowls and there was enough for another 5 more bowls.  Our other food didn't arrive so we asked another server and he went to check.  His excuse was we are very busy, which I can see but the timing of the food could have been better.  The rest of the meal arrived shortly after and it was tasty.  There was too much for the 2 of us so we had food for the next day.  Not bad for $37.   When asking for take out containers and cutlery, the waiter made us feel like we inconvenienced him and although he bought us what we asked, he made it known h was bothered.  For this, the rating drops.  This place is better to come when it's not so busy and the service will be better."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers on a Monday and was pleasantly surprised by the dim sum carts being wheeled around the restaurant.  Variety was great and the dim sum was tasty.  For dessert we had these buns that were filled with a yellow, coconut paste.  They were soooooo good! Best part of the meal! Seemed like the bill was very reasonable (I didn't pay).  I think we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Can I really comment on Dim Sum? I'm white. Speak no Cantonese or Mandarin, and I love all Dim Sums equally, like Jesus loved children. So, when I was invited out for Dim Sum this past weekend by a bona fide Chinese friend, I thought, yes, I will eat Dim Sum and write an insightful Yelp review by leeching off of my friend's cultural and gourmand insight.  I don't know. I liked the place. Some of the best taro balls that I have ever had, the tripe was great. It was all awesome. I didn't order a thing though, as it was all done by my friend. So another experience via proxy which I felt was pretty satisfying.  And Jason, maybe you went during lunch or something when all the white-ys from City Hall meander down for lunch? I went on a Monday for Dim Sum and I was one of maybe 2 white people in the place."}
{"text":"Was so excited to eat here as I wanted dim sum on my first night in Calgary. They only do dim sum for lunch.  Got stuck in the middle of the restaurant with a pushy server who was rushing for reasons I do not know why.  Took 35 min to get our food and it was mediocre. When we weren't being rushed no one was around for long periods of time.  The manager seemed to be yelling at an old man server, as well.  Not enjoyable. Felt stressed by the whole situation.  Definitely wasn't worth $108."}
{"text":"They got the best ginger beef and hot pots here. They invented ginger beef and many others try to imitate it but they can never duplicate it. Been coming here for over 20 year. They are the best."}
{"text":"I'm still in search of a great Dim Sum place in Calgary.  It's quite hard as I always compare to my favourite spots in Toronto!  This place is actually quite good!  Very busy and we were at a nice big table for 8 of us with a great  lazy susan table to assist with serving.  We had reservations and thankfully didn't wait too long.  But there was a constant line-up at the door - always a good sign!  I love Dim Sum with carts as it makes it more of an interactive event.  The servers were quick and friendly.  Always mentioning both the Chinese name and english definitions which is nice for those who aren't familiar with items.  The carts were constant and had definite variety.   We had all the essentials and was very impressed by their BBQ Pork Steamed bums - MY FAV! They were fresh, hot and the filling was awesome.  I also enjoyed the chicken feet - yup I said it!  I love em!  The rest of the party enjoyed everything else including the Shangai Pork Dumplings, Ginger Beef and other dumplings.  The tea was steeped nicely and I enjoyed the constant filling up of water to wash everything down.  Great job Silver Dragon!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for dim sum on a Friday afternoon. Parking is expensive around Chinatown! $5/hr. This restaurant was recommended to us and it pulled through. Fresh dishes pushed through carts, service was great, something unexpected from a popular Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Half of the patrons there were not Chinese so I guess other people agree with me. A little pricey and limited choices although we got all the basics today: har gow siu mai, chicken feet, tofu meat rolls and rice shrimp rolls sticky rice. One of the severs even volunteered to order shrimp rolls for us when there was none and we asked her if her cart had any - wonderful! Her name was Amy - thanks Amy! I also wanted some congee but they gave me a menu that only has scallop congee. I would return here again."}
{"text":"The five of us had a very pleasant dim sum lunch on our last day prior to flying back to the States after completing a tour of the Canadian Rockies.  I found the restaurant doing an online search of Chinese restaurants in Calgary Chinatown.  Looked up the restaurant and found they've got a website.  Their sister restaurant is in Banff.  On our tour, we were in Banff.  Our tour guide said the Banff location is very popular and reservations suggested.    Here in Calgary we went to dim sum Monday around 11:30am.  The restaurant is located upstairs.  No elevator as far as I could tell.  And very steep stairs up.  We were seated immediately.  Ready to order tea but it just came in an insulated pot.  Maybe they assumed we didn't know how to order tea???  Just a few tables of folks eating.  As time passed, the restaurant began filling up.  We were very pleased with the dim sum.  Dim sum pushed on a cart.  We got the usual offerings.  If something wasn't on the cart, we asked.  Then later it was brought to our table.  Food fresh and good size portions.  Two shoutouts - the har gow and the steamed shrimp rice roll.  Huge size shrimps.  We all left very content.    Side note:  my sister charged lunch.  The guy upfront at the counter immediately charged her USD on her credit card.  He didn't give her a choice of charging in CAD or USD.  How come?  Per Consumer Reports: Don't let foreign merchants charge you in U.S. dollars. This is a trap that credit card users sometimes fall into, Schulz says. If a merchant offers to charge your card in U.S. dollars rather than the local currency--also called dynamic currency conversion--don't agree to the offer. The exchange rate is often poor, and the merchant may also add fees on top of that. It's best to leave your charge in the original currency and let your credit card company provide you with its exchange rate.  4.0 food 1.0 bad business practice"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for the last 18 years. Always good always great quality. Can get very busy around noon.  The best Dim Sum we have had anywhere. Hard to say anything else."}
{"text":"Somehow I ended up in Chinatown around dinnertime and I saw stickers for all the awards this place has won over the years.  I thought I'd give it a shot based on those awards alone.  When I got inside, I saw a fairly typical Chinese restaurant...outdated decor, large goldfish in a small tank, and a large empty room with seemingly more staff than customers.  I ordered house special chow mein and Mongolian beef.  The good thing about the two dishes was they definitely did not skimp out on the meat on the house special chow mein.  Everything else was a disappointment.  The portions were tiny, the chow mein was bland, and I don't know what they consider Mongolian beef in Canada, but it's nothing like I've ever experienced before.  They put a yellow curry sauce over huge chunks of beef.  It wasn't very good and I wouldn't order it again.  The food was extremely overpriced for what it was.  I'm not sure how they won any accolades, unless the rest of the Chinese food in all of Calgary is that much worse."}
{"text":"When did this place get so expensive?! Dim sum is pretty good and so are the dishes but holy, you can get the same quality of food for 25% in a lot of the other places in China Town! Is it just me? Anyway, Silver Dragon has been fairly consistent throughout the years and is definitely worth checking out. The only thing I will say is there is food just as good as silver dragon all across China Town!"}
{"text":"Saturday dim sum. I think the service is excellent. All servers were in uniform and the restaurant was decorated for Chinese New year. Did not have to wait as we went early. The dim sum is pushed around on carts. Most dim sum is pretty tasty, I wouldn't say this is my favorite place, but it's alright."}
{"text":"Locals say it's the best in Calgary. How is that even possible? Sure it was packed, people were even waiting for tables for 30 mins. The food was not out of the ordinary, it was pretty much average,- no wait, below average considering the service. I asked the waiter for coffee and he yelled at me \"No Coffee! Just Tea!\". What? They don't have Chinese tea?"}
{"text":"I was stuck in a hotel and wanted something somewhat healthy, so I ordered veggies and tofu delivered.  It was SO GOOD and a very large portion that lasted me a couple days. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"The fam and I ended up at Silver Dragon after a long trip back from Lake Louise.  We were staying at the Eau Clair Sheraton and we needed something for dinner - and it was getting late. Unlike Toronto where everything seems to open forever, it was slim pickings in the area.  After eventually setting on Chinese food, because \"China Town\" was nearby, we started our walk over to see what was available. The only place that was opened was Silver Dragon.  I know some reviews rave about Dim Sum (and some don't) and I didn't see a lot of dinner reviews, but hey, can't be too bad right? The place was a trip down memory lane when Chinese restaurants were decorated for wedding banquets.  Tacky and worn out - reminds me of a Seinfeld episode with a clued out Host and a mostly Caucasian clientele. The place was sparsely populated since it was a bit late.   The wait staff kept coming over and asking if we wanted the seafood specials.  I've been in that situation before.  The seafood menu does not have pricing and some times, the prices are made up on the spot - basically what can we charge these people today?  Decided not to get into that game at this place. We ordered just a couple of dishes, rice and my older son wanted the hot and sour soup. The soup was basically the last drips off the ladle and water down to make a small bowl - my son was so hungry he just didn't care.  We were worried that the rest of the order was going to be whatever they scraped together. The beef dish was surprisingly good but the chicken was bland. For the prices that they were charging, we expected so much more!  A place like this would have gone under 5 times over in any of Toronto's competitive Chinatowns."}
