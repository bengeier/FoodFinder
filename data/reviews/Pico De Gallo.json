{"text":"Totally agree with Kim!!! There food tastes better than most places I've been to. My bf and I love this place too!"}
{"text":"Came here enticed by the smells of the food court, and decided to order a ceviche. I asked in advance how large the serving was, as at a price point of $10, it wasn't cheap. The chef showed me a decently sized bowl, and indicated a slight mound over the top. Seeing that it would be a decent portion, I chose to order it. I also decided to add the extra $1 for shrimp.

I was completely duped! When he delivered the ceviche, it was much much smaller than expected. Perhaps the smaller portion was for the better though, as I wasn't a big fan of the dish. The flavour was very harsh and raw - not as well rounded as the other ceviches I've had in the past. The biting lime flavour was overpowering. Moreover, the raw fish and scallops were of poor quality. The fish was cut in varying sizes and chunks, and was limp to the bite. The texture was highly unappetizing. I was glad that I at least paid extra for the shrimp - it was the main redeeming part of the dish.

I wasn't very impressed and won't return, particularly as I feel I was fooled by the owner. It may have been a small detail, but I think it speaks volumes!"}
{"text":"I had to do a double-take at Pico de Gallo when I stopped in at Gordo's to get a taco from Chilaca. I'm sure I've been here before, and added it to Yelp, but it was no where to be seen in my check in list.
So I had to add it and buy something for takeaway. I ordered the chicken soup which was surprisingly chock full of chick peas ($10). Not what I expected, but pretty darn good to eat. Along with the tub of soup, he provided a container of fresh toppings to throw on when serving which was a nice touch. Nothing outstanding, but hit the spot for me that day.
If you look at the menu options with pictures on the counter, plenty of it looked enticing and I will be back soon to try out the meat dish with chicken, beef and pork."}
{"text":"Defiantly the best Mexican restaurant I've ever tried. Came to this place when I had my a little store in the huge outside flea market, and this is my favorite. I order the Alambres every Saturdays and Sundays for my lunch, and I never get tired of it. The chicken, beef, pork, and bacon are freshly grilled with some veggies. I brought my friends over here multiple times and they all loved it. Sometimes we just drove over 25 minutes from Southwest to this hidden place just to get the Alambre. Their customer service is great. Staffs always have a big smile on their face and they keep checking on you to make sure everything is okay. I usually tip 15-20% of the bill, but for this place I can't stop tipping $5 for a $10 Alambre entree every time I go there because of the exceptional food and service they provided."}
{"text":"Our office had a delivery order from Pico de Gallo and it was thoroughly unimpressive. I had the chicken bowl. The chicken was bland and dry -- and not much of it. Actually, that's a good way to describe the whole bowl."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I came with my Girlfriend, she got the ceviche and I got the brisket torta. This is definatelly super tasty and cheap.  We really enjoy it.  There are not many seats tho. But we had a fun time"}
{"text":"I only ever get their rice and beans but they are by far the best rice and beans I have ever had. They have other very delicious things as well. I highly suggest you go check them out if you're in Broadacres Swap meet."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I ventured in weeks ago after finding that jumbo empanada was closed!  I was super happy to find this place.  I had the ceviche, and I bought it to share with a preggo friend and so they accommodated the request...I think she didn't want fish.  It was delicious!  I was in Kensington today and ordered it the normal way ~ it was still great!  What a fantastic find.  I will get this every time I'm in the area.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying it's worth the 25-35 min drive from southwest. We just left and it never disappoints \" Pollo Enchilado \" and the Chori Alambre it's two of our favorites with its hand made tortillas brings the dish together for a full complete authentic meal just like mom used to make. Pollo enchilado is nicely marinated and grilled with just enough spice to enjoy ..Chori Alambre is just delicious honestly words can't explain how amazing it is you would have to come and try it yourselves. Highly recommend this place, from the atmosphere, service and food"}
{"text":"First time here and we fell in love. We got the chicken salad and pollo enchilado. The sauce is amazing. Tortillas are hand made. The chicken is grilled. Everything was delicious !"}
