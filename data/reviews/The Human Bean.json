{"text":"This the best coffee,it's my love it's been 2years since I left Oregon but now I have the best coffee back in my life there is no better place then the human bean"}
{"text":"This place is just the best!!!! It has some of the best coffee  drinks ever. I am so happy that this place opened up. I can't wait to go back again and again. The service is great and super friendly. I just wish there were more locations around!!!! This incredible place has chocolate covered espresso beans( which are delicious ) and mini butter cakes ( also awesome).  The Human Bean is just soooo good. It is even better than Starbucks and Dutch Bros. I absolutely love the Human Bean!!!    BTW: The frozen hot chocolate is the best!!!   Pic of frozen hot chocolate shown below"}
{"text":"The Human Bean is kinda of my favorite place right now! I love the fact that there are so many options to choose from and the employees are so friendly that it makes it  hard not to come back. I think I found my go to coffee place!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on my experience with plain black coffee but it is pretty bleh.... tasted stale like it had been sitting on heat for quite some time. There's also something wrong with the cups - twice now the sides of my cup caved in which of course means the lid won't stay on, which of course inevitably means that when I take a sip of it during a meeting, the lid will come off and coffee will spill all over my dry clean only dress. At least that was today's experience."}
{"text":"Thanks to this place, I don't have to go all the way to Tim Horton's just to get a frozen hot chocolate! I absolutely adore this place. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and all drinks come with a chocolate-covered coffee bean. I haven't tried very many of their drinks on the menu yet, but what I have tried, I can't get enough of. I'm probably gonna get some more tonight! Also, while the frozen hot chocolate is great, their caramel apple smoothie is awesome too! I'm having a pavlovian response to this place lol, I'm gonna go get some right now."}
{"text":"Macha delicious, fraps wonderful, Green tea was good but not \"green\" or yellow... brown but low bitterness so it was a green :)   Really friendly service, muffin tops were yummy.   They also give you little beans to flick, that's fun too"}
{"text":"This place is really great! Anyone who appreciates real brewed coffee as apposed to the powder crap at Dutch Bros understands how much better it is than Dutch Bros. Nice to have a real coffee place near me that is very accessable."}
{"text":"On top of my iced latte Minus the whip cream Off dropped my espresso  White chocolate covered bean   It rolled off my cup lid  and onto the floor ....  Now I can't f-ing eat it  anymore.... Mere seconds after mentioning to the barista that I almost forgot they place a white chocolate covered bean atop each cup, she said a lot get accidentally dropped & in my haste to suck down my caffeine I too dropped my precious coffee bean!  I've been here 3 times in less then a week, I just don't feel human without the magic nectar derived from coffee beans! Whether it's a morning wake me up or an afternoon perk me up, the Human Bean in Tempe is a perfect place to stop or get some drive through caffeine!  I've had the caramel, pumpkin and chai latte, all brewed to perfection with great flavor and served with a smile!  Then I read the Human Bean serves more than just caffeine they support their fellow human beings with free coffee on 9/11 to 1st responders, to Veterans on Veteran's day, donating a portion to Women's Cancer with Coffee for a Cure in October, Men's Cancer with Mochas for Men in in November.   The Human Bean is more than just a perk me up... it's caffeine with a cause served by the cup!"}
{"text":"I ordered the caramel apple smoothie and it was delicious! Since I'm new to Arizona, I was looking for a good coffee place. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this location because it's always close by when I'm either running an errand in Tempe or at something related to ASU. They are about a mile south of the 202. My Dad once lived in Ashland, OR years ago and I vaguely remember going through the original Human Bean drive-thru there. That's where this company got their start. They are known for their hand-crafted espresso drinks and fruit-infused smoothies. And of course every drink is topped with a white chocolate espresso bean. They have a program called the Farm Friendly Direct that allows them to work directly with the farming communities that harvest their beans so that they can build long-term relationships with them. This location has a double drive-thru or you can walk up to the window. You order directly from the barista and not through some intercom which I love. The baristas are usually high energy and personable. I haven't tried one of their teas yet, but I really enjoyed their popular Granita drink. During the holidays they do holiday style cup that is pretty festive."}
{"text":"Way better than Dutch Bros!!! This coffee stand is my new favorite place. The prices are so much more reasonable for a cup of coffee compared to other coffee shops. I had a great experience with the employees. I was not sure what to order and they were so helpful in guiding me towards what I was in the mood for. I had a peppermint mocha, which was amazing, and I am so glad that they serve peppermint year round! I will definitely be coming back. I highly recommend giving it a try! I was told they also do to-go orders for businesses and offices so that was awesome!"}
{"text":"SO happy there is finally a human bean in this area (for all the PNWer's)  Great coffee, options and staff! I love the peppermint mocha"}
{"text":"This place is good! I love that they are open at 5am to accommodate early morning workers. There is tons of variety on the menu. I tried the sugar free green tea latte and it was delicious. Kind of pricey for my taste but i will be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love their caramel granitas with a double shot of espresso!! If you like blended iced coffee with great coffee taste give them a shot.. I get them with no whip but if your a whip lover then this drink is the one for you... Only at the Human Bean"}
{"text":"On the go and need a cup o' Joe?!   The Human Bean is the newest drive thru coffee shop in town, with its original ties to Oregon, it's bringing their coffee and steamers to us.   They have your traditional offerings from lattes, to breves and some smoothies for the kids. The menu is simple with a few seasonal offerings. I ordered the Snowy Mocha which was perfection. The sweet was subtle and the coffee was perfectly smooth. I ordered Mate Latte for my husband hot and he loved the taste. The best part, each drink comes with a chocolate covered espresso bean!  I have been watching their facebook for a while and the cool thing is this stand was a prefab that was just installed less than a month ago!   The prices were good and the staff were extremely friendly. The stand has two sides to take your order so you don't have to wait long. This coffee shop is located on the Southwest corner of Mcclintock and University. Today was their opening day and I'm excited for them to stay."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been so excited for this place to open and I'm hyped it finally did! I had heard about the ones in Oregon and how amazing they are and I am glad to say that The Human Bean lived up to their reputation!   It's a small little shop where you can walk up to the window or drive through. They offer lots of different coffee products but I decided to go with their signature Granita with caramel and whip cream  It is soooo good and refreshing and sweet and delicious. I also hear the java chip flavor is amazing so I'll have to try that one next time!!   The staff was super friendly and the music they were playing was upbeat and fun. I'll definitely bring my friends back here!   All in all, 10/10 recommend, you've gotta try it"}
{"text":"I am certainly glad there is a coffee shop that is decent and friendly to my wallet, esp when I turn to caffeine majority of the time. LOL. The customer service is pleasant, Alexis and Kenny usually helps me out. They have different sizes in cups so you have plenty of choices to choose from. The prices varies based on what you're getting but still is affordable. The menu is HUGE which includes to not all but teas, coffee, smoothies, Rockstars, sodas, etc. If you're picky with flavors like me, they have a long list of flavors for teas, coffee, smoothies, Rockstars and sodas. What made this place a gem for me was the amount of sugar-free flavors they carried, which was more than I expected.   BONUS:  *They have two drive through lines and a walk up. There's plenty of parking spaces within the area.  *They're still new to the area so there is no \"black Friday\" lines like Dutch Bros/Starbucks. Yay!"}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised at the quality of coffee they serve here. A+. The cup sizes are larger than most coffee shops so you get more for your money. They have Rockstars (multiple flavors including sugar free and carbonation free) and hundreds of flavors that you can mix in.  (also come with or without sugar)  Delicious!! I'm so happy I took the time to stop and try this little place out! I will be visiting often!"}
{"text":"Got the acai smoothie, it was good.  Reasonably priced.  Quick service.  Felt healthy. Confused by the bean on top.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Came around 3pm on their grand opening day and I love this place already. Parked and walked up to the window..everyone was so friendly. I asked a man standing outside what he suggested from the menu and he walked my friend and I through some of the different drinks, popular items and what his favorites were. I ended up ordering the Carmel Apple Smoothie and it is delicious! So flavorful and tastes just like the caramel apple suckers you see around Halloween. My friend got the frozen hot chocolate  and she really enjoyed it too.   I'm not a coffee drinker but was able to find a bunch of things on the menu that would serve as a delicious pick me up on both hot and cooler days. From smoothies, to chai, to hot chocolate to teas I can't wait to come back and try more flavors."}
{"text":"Stopping by today and love their Vanilla ice latte. The staff is super friendly too. A must try guys."}
{"text":"Just left this place and the barista, or whatever you would want to call her, can't get a simple black pineapple tea down correctly. The first drink she made me was a green tea and it was just all pineapple syrup. The second drink she gave was still a green tea. Then I asked if I can just switch my drink to a cold brew and she told me I could keep my pineapple tea while she went off to make me a cold brew. Another lady then came up and was going to charge me for my cold brew drink. I asked her if I could just pay the difference because I was dissatisfied from my first drink, or if I could just get a refund and she made it so complicated. So I left with the drink I first paid for which was the wrong drink.  STARBUCKS would have offered me a free drink. I should have went to Starbucks.  *Replying to the owner* That barista did not offer a refund. She said \"because it is already in the system they can't refund us the money.\" At that point my boyfriend and I told them never mind and drove away because they made it seem so complicated. This place is never getting our business again. Stick to whatever coffee shops you go to and save your money from this ripoff place. They don't like to satisfy their customers."}
{"text":"Java Chip 32 Ounce Goodness!  Friendly Service with a smile at this little island shop off the main drag on University west of the 101 freeway a bit.   Delicious treats made by friendly people to make your stomach smile...  Happy stomach means happy person!   Stop by and get a tasty drink, maybe the Java Chip 32 ounce with coconut milk like me! it satisfies my inner animal and puts me right to sleep! nothing like some coffee before bed to make you even more tired!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great location and friendly staff! We used a free coupon because we not ever heard of this place. Our whole office is hooked now. Watch out Dutch Bros - this place is giving you a run for your money."}
{"text":"Good experience and was wondering why the heck it was dead at 9am in Tempe! I got the Mexi Mocha which is good but I'm surely wanting to come back to try one of the smoothies. They look great. I'm wondering the amount of competition with the \"Bros\" because their concept is pretty similar. Love their little espresso bean they give you and am currently wondering if they sell those in a bag because I'd buy them! They have my dog a pup cup with whipped cream and sent us on our way. Solid 4/5 and if the smoothie is better than the Mexi Mocha, I'd re-evaluate for a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Starbucks and Dutch brothers are now dead to me. This place blows them away. So delicious and they have many fun choices to choose from!  The coffee is absolutely fantastic and high quality.  I had a breve and my husband had a coffee granita.  All the drinks come with a chocolate covered espresso bean on top.  Yum! Our girls had a frozen hot chocolate.  The girls that work there are so friendly and helpful. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So many unique flavor combinations to decide from! There's definitely something for everyone here- coffee lovers or not. The baristas are friendly and quick to serve you! A new hot commodity in Tempe!"}
{"text":"If you like the sugary and weak coffee that Gloria Jeans serves, then this place is for you. I ordered a iced vanilla latte that just tasted like sweet milk. It's hard to believe there was any coffee in this drink and I could barely taste any vanilla. Hopefully Black Rock Coffee puts a location near ASU so everyone can experience great coffee."}
{"text":"My cap was delicious and it comes with a chocolate covered coffee bean on top! Everyone was so nice and great service!!"}
{"text":"Oh how do I love the Human Bean!   Every time I go, I look at the menu and I know I should try something different, but I order the same thing all time, hot or iced it's the same. I go with a salted caramel latte and love it every time!! Also with each other of coffee, its topped off with a chocolate covered coffee bean, so sweet!  You can drive thru, there are 2 windows or you can walk up, I really have never had a long of wait. The staff is always friendly, no matter what time of the day, sometimes I am there before 5:30am sometimes before 2pm. They have lots of flavors of coffee and non coffee items to get and the prices are great too!    Run, don't walk to the Human Bean and get you some coffee!"}
{"text":"I normally don't do reviews but I'm excited there's finally a location in Phoenix. Great coffee, reasonable prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time here, made my order simple with a vanilla soy late. It was pretty good, same price compared to a Starbucks, super smooth I could almost not tell there was any shots of espresso in it. On the outside looks like a Dutch bros but with two drive ins (didn't know that until after I drove around). Don't make that mistake of sitting in a line when u don't have to! Definitely want to try more unique orders-I.e. Specialty drinks...would try again!"}
{"text":"This place is a new coffee shop in Tempe as of November 2017, and it'll already be competing with Dutch Bro's and Starbucks for your coffee needs!   They have a ton of hot drinks from Coffee, Lattes to Steve Smith teas, and cold/iced drinks from smoothies, frozen hot chocolates, and  rockstar smoothies as well.   Good prices for amazing drinks, and the syrup list they have is overwhelming! They hired an amazing, friendly staff who love to talk about the menu and help guide you through so many choices. If you're like me who can never decide what to get because he wants to try everything, they'll being able to narrow it down to what you really want. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I love that drive-thru coffee is such a thing in the Metro now. I came twice while visiting my friend in Mesa and both times, the coffee was great and served by a friendly barista. And without the fake banter or ridiculously loud music you get from their chain twin from Holland. Plus, with every drink, you also get a chocolate-covered espresso bean. Definitely a great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Came here to get energized before work on a Sunday! They have a double drive thru and I didn't realize you could drive around and go to the other side so I waited behind a car on the right. Neat concept though, plus you can walk up to the window in the middle and order too.   The barista was kind and apologized for my wait, as the person ahead of me had ordered multiple drinks. I got the 16oz java chip granita with almond milk, no whip. It was tasty, had the right amount of caffeine and sugar to keep me going. I did need to mix it up since the coffee granules kept sinking to the bottom. Their menu has a wide selection of drinks as well as breakfast burritos and pastries. I like that it's close to ASU but far enough that it's not too busy. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"This place is a definite must try! How have I lived without The Human Bean all these years? First off, there are two drive-thrus (***so no more 15 minute Starbucks lines!!!), and a walk up window as well! The staff was cheerful, patient, and very informative... This is key to me, especially in a coffee shop, and The Human Bean nailed it!  I ordered a vanilla granita topped with whipped cream. A granita is basically a blended espresso drink and your choice of flavoring - lots to choose from! I would definitely recommend this drink if it's your first time visiting because the staff mentioned that it's a signature of theirs! If you're looking for something a little lighter, I ordered a latte (w/ almond milk and SF Irish cream flavoring) the second time I came, and it was delicious as well!   My favorite part is the chocolate covered espresso bean they top all of their drinks with! It's such an adorable touch! I cannot wait to watch this gem grow, grow, & grow! I'll definitely be back soon because if you can't already tell, I'm obsessed! Thank you THB for a wonderful coffee experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered the medium white chocolate mocha, I like it!! it's smooth and a little sweet.. Definitely good stuff... new coffee shop no lines! A must try!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been there once and the coffee was delicious. Only 4 stars because it's very overpriced. They gave me a little chocolate with the coffee so that was nice but it melted on the lid because I was driving so I didn't eat it right away hahah. Probably won't go back because of the price but really good tasting coffee!!"}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a iced Chai latte. Drove away and realized they just gave me an iced coffee. Also a 12oz iced Chai latte and flavored Rockstar (menu said it was $4) came out to $10 even. Wasn't sure if this was the right price for the total but I wasn't given or offered a receipt."}
{"text":"Another. Coffee place. In. My. Hood.  #blessed?  I can't complain! Just my personal pref, I prefer Dutch over Human Bean, but HB is a close second. Their staff are awesome, the drinks are tasty, creative, and strong! I'd kept my eye on this spot ever since the building was brought in and laid down in October 2017 (just like a permanent trailer), and waited patiently til their soft opening to try them out in November. It's nice that they have two drive thru lanes, but I've honestly never seen them that busy to warrant both. The baristas can be uber creative. A few times I've been feeling open and asked them to make me something based on what I normally buy (plain iced coffee or cold brew w light SF vanilla and almond milk), and it's all been homeruns! Either a jolt of caffeine for a night out with friends or just a good drink to take on a stroll around town, these guys are good.  Watch out Kona13, Human Bean is coming for ya!"}
{"text":"The Java bean!!!!  First time stopping in for coffee, I had to try the java bean. I was delicious. Java bean in every sip. The perfect amount of coffee. We ordered the 20oz for $5.25. Figured we didn't need the 24oz at 10pm.   We went through the drive through. Fast service. Or you can walk up to the window.  New hot business!"}
{"text":"I was driving to school, saw this tiny coffee/smoothie stand and made an illegal action movie u-turn right in the middle of the street to get to it after passing by. I was warmly welcomed by staff here and I was very impressed with the menu variety and selections they offered. The wait was not too long, prices were good, and to my surprise the smoothie I got was DELICIOUS! Rarely do I get the perfect trifecta! I really enjoyed my drink and will be coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try out a new coffee shop near campus because a few girls we know have tried this place out! I ordered a vanilla snowy mocha with coconut milk in the 16 ounce, which is pretty small to be honest! It's pretty good, but the location of the shop was hard to get to (just from the direction we were headed). I might be back if I'm around the area, but it wasn't anything I was going crazy for!"}
{"text":"Great name and location! Love that they have a walk-up counter AND two drive thru lanes (duh, makes so much sense logistically)! They offer SO many flavored syrups which is so nice!  Came on a Saturday afternoon and there was no line, probably because it's still so new. I can see this place getting slammed soon! Woman at the drive thru was super friendly and patient with all my questions and she gave some great drink recs.  Ended up ordering the blended Granita w a butterscotch flavored shot. There was still a strong coffee flavor which I love and asked for, but the butterscotch shot was sweet and made it simply delicious. I can't wait to try more of their blended drinks, especially with our sunny, hot weather.   Love supporting local businesses. Watch out, Dutch Bros - you've got a major contender!!"}
{"text":"It was okay. I am a fan of Dutch Brothers, but thought I'd stop by & try it. It was okay, I have to say their muffin tops are good, but wasn't a fan of my drink. I got a chai latte with nutmeg & my fiance ordered the whole bean 12 oz coffee. He said his was nice & strong.  Also, not the friendliest customer service. Felt like I was rushed.  I'd say try it if you don't have any other choice. But Im going to stick to what I know & thats Dutch Brothers! :) I give them an A for effort though."}
