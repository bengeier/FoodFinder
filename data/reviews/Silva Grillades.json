{"text":"J'ai demandé au serveur d'allumé la bougie 3 fois sans résultat avant la facture.
La paëla était trop chaude, trop salé, trop cuite presque brulé."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very good service. I've ordered a Paella and the seafood wasn't over-cooked (actually, the calamari was just right, not rubbery at all). However, it is a bit pricey for what being served."}
{"text":"Quoique le service soit excellent, la cuisson du steak n'est pas fiable. Pour un steak, j'irais ailleurs. Surtout que c'est quand même un peu cher.

Je viens de recevoir un appel du propriétaire qui m'a retracé. Il a utilisé un ton défensif et voulait argumenter avec moi. Je lui ai expliqué que son personnel de service est excellent, et que j'aurais accepté volontiers de retourner à son restaurant (mais pas pour un steak). Mais la discussion avec lui ayant été désagréable, c'est à cause de lui que j'ai maintenant une expérience réellement négative et que je ne veux plus retourner à son restaurant."}

{"text":"I loved this place! Had a party for a big crowd and the food and the service were excellent. I highly recommend the bacalhau (cod) as well as the grilled shrimp!"}
{"text":"This place takes pride in food and service. Simple yet elegant preparations of Portuguese classics. Highly recomnende"}
{"text":"When I rated this, it is showing up on Yelp as 2.5 stars! This is absolutely not a 2.5 star restaurant and there are no reviews to justify that, so I am confused.

This restaurant came recommended to me by 3 people who have been there multiple times. I looked it up on Yelp but one of my colleagues who I know has a history of pointing me to good restaurants insisted.

I ordered the Garlic Shrimp appetizer, the grill mix, and the tart dessert.

Everything was excellent and perfectly cooked. The service was amazing, the atmosphere very nice. Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambience, I really recommend POLVO, and the pork, the food takes long, but the music, and the place are great to have a romantic dinner or a family meeting."}
{"text":"Colorful Portuguese dishes in an upscale setting for a great price. 

For lunch they have a tapas and entree menu with plenty of options. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and happy to answer questions about the food (the menu was Portuguese/French only).

Complementary baskets of warm, fresh bread were served. We started off with fried shrimp in a savory sauce from the tapas menu to share. Entrees came included with soup/salad of the day and dessert. The cream of carrot soup was delicious. The entrees were generously sized and extremely flavorful. My grilled calamari had onions, avocados, and potatoes with a sauce. The dessert was the Portuguese classic pastéis de nata; it was rich and warm. There was a wide selection of beers and wines. 

Between the 4 of us we ordered 1 tapas dish and and 4 entrees for $105, plus 7 beers for $38. Definitely worth it for the amount of food and how delicious it was."}
{"text":"Our server was great but the food took an eternity to come; 1 hour.  
Nice wine selection.
$28 for paella; which was enough for two but rather expensive.
My date got the sausages tapas, you only get 3 slices. 
I would try it again, maybe at a less busy time and explore more of the smaller dishes."}
{"text":"Presentation was 10/10, Servers and service 10/10
Very nice and classy place but I'm sorry the food was very bland 4/10."}
