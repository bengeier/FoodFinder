{"text":"Second best BBQ in g-town but second to none with their homemade sides. Must try BBQ beans, and hand piped hush puppies."}
{"text":"Super friendly wait staff. Awesome pork BBQ. Incredible onions rings. I hear the burgers and Bologna sandwich are great as well. Tarheels memorabilia galore."}
{"text":"Love places like this. Small place with amazing food. The bologna sandwich is thick enough to feed an army with great flavor!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places!  It's good food, and a lot of it, for very reasonable prices.  It is a hole in the wall and there is not any emphasis on health so if you are looking for lo-cal this is not your place.  The BBQ is piled on - and I mean piled on - the bun.  We always get the baked sweet potatoes which are very good.  The kids get fries and they are good too.  The kids love their chicken fingers and hush puppies (for anyone with kids you understand the importance of being able to please them).  There is limited parking and seating but we've never had to wait for more than 10 minutes or so.  When a table opens it, you better claim it.  The service is great, especially considering they are always packed when we have been there. We live in Gastonia so it will definitely be one of our favorite eating spots."}
{"text":"Do not miss this BBQ joint, in fact, just follow the smoke trail and you'll find it. Warning....cash only accepted and expect a wait, the line is usally through the door, but it moves at a good pace.     I've been frequenting this place since it opened and it never disappoints. Food is hot, smokey, and oh so flavorful. I'm a sucker for the small chopped pork basket which includes BBQ, fries, and hush puppies, you can sub onion rings for a small fee and it is SO worth it, they are hand battered fresh onion rings. I love the tangy BBQ slaw as well and often order a small side of it. My husband and I can eat here for under $15 tip included and feel like we need a wheelbarrow.      I used Kyle's for catering as well. Everyone loved the food and they were very generous with their per person portioning. BBQ, Slaw, Beans, Buns, Chips, Tea, Sauce, Cups, Plates, Napkins, Utensils and delivery and set-up all for 6.95 a person. That is a STEAL!! For Sam J who feels the need to criticize other people's reviews and their grammer, get a life, some people take this too seriously!"}
{"text":"I drive by here and smell the BBQ cooking all the time.  I decided I finally had to try this hole-in-the-wall Barbecue joint.  So I called in and placed an order for take out the other day.  I got the rib plate.  The service was good and the portions were very large.  The half rack of ribs came with beans, fries, slaw, and hush puppies and was a full 2 meals for me.  The ribs were cooked perfect and were delicious!  They came with a great sweet and tangy barbecue sauce in a small container that I wish I had more of.  The slaw I didn't care for much, but I have to say that I'm not much of a slaw person anyway.  I'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I must admit that NC style BBQ is not my favorite, but I thought that Kyle's was pretty good for the genre.   What pushes it up to 4* are the sides and the value.  It's a small place, and the decor is a little divey spruced up by a lot of UNC memorabilia.  I figured for $7 the portions couldn't be that big. Wrong!  A truly insane amount of BBQ, so much that I couldn't even come close to finishing it.  I'm a big eater and I'm telling you, the large plate feeds two easily.   The onion rings (a slight surcharge) were very tasty, and the cole slaw was above average.  Only the corn hushpuppy sticks were bland.  They only takes cash, and close a little on the early side, but it's a great value stop for somebody passing through on I-85."}
{"text":"Wow. Easily some of the tastiest BBQ in the Charlotte region.   Kyle Fletcher's is easy to find right off of I-85 and does not disappoint. The staff is very friendly and the menu has all the favorites you would expect. From pulled or chopped pork to burgers to fries hush puppies onion rings etc.   Be careful on how much you order because they do not disappoint on portion size. It's easily doable to feed 2 people for around $10.   Also it's cash only so don't forget that. Be sure to try this place."}
{"text":"Easily best burgers in Gaston County.  Haven't ordered barbecue since I discovered the burgers. Onion rings excellent too. Worth time to wait to get in at lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place. The pork is tender and juicy and has a nice mild smokey flavor. There are two sauces. I like to  add the spicey vinager sauce to the meat and then top it with the thicker sweeter ketchup based sauce. Then put some BBQ slaw on top and you have the best BBQ sandwich ever! Cash only, limited parking. Closed on Sundays and Mondays."}
{"text":"Review based on 1 visit:  CONTEXT: I was driving down from PA to GA, down I-85, stopped here for a bite based on the yelp reviews. I agree with the rating, this place is very good indeed.  I was here around 7 PM, the place was packed, but the table turnover was quick. Not much room to wait for a table inside, but that's OK, the weather was good, and the parking lot smells gooooood.  TASTE: 8/10. Chopped Pork Plate: Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but pretty good nonetheless. They have a vinegar/pepper hot sauce, and a thick sweet/spicy BBQ sauce. Apply both liberally. Chopped pork had a great texture and smell, went well with the sauces. Hot sauce could be hotter, the sweet BBQ sauce was perfect. Sides: Onion rings were great, hush puppies were good, beans need to be porkier, slaw was unique and very good.   SERVICE: Good, quick. I peeked at the menu while I waited, so I knew what I wanted by the time I sat down at a table. 5 mins tops between my order and a giant basket of food being set in front of me. Good work, considering the crowd. Lady at the counter, and my server were both friendly and nice.  PORTIONS: Very generous.   VERDICT: I would go out of my way to return here and/or prefer routes through NC that take I-85 just so I can stop by again."}
{"text":"Best bbq around!  Best value around! Don't go if you are in a hurry, because they are usually packed, and for good reason."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that we were starving after just getting off a 5 hour flight, but this was some awesome BBQ. Pork was great, fries were great, onion rings were great, hush puppies were great, as were the beans and slaw. Can't believe how much food arrived for the \"small\" plate (a LOT).   And one thing that ONLY the south does right:  SWEET TEA. And this was some tasty sweet tea. All of this, plus friendly, attentive service?  Awesome. If I lived closer I'd gain 10 pounds becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight and were very happy. The BBQ was great. I got a small and my husband got a large (BBQ pork sandwich). The large was HUGE. We both thought the small was the perfect size. Meat was very smoky and delicious, sauce was great, slaw was good but not the best. Hush puppies were great but a little sweeter than I prefer. Baked beans were \"eh\" and we didn't like the mushy onion rings. But the BBQ itself was great and that was what we went for, so no complaints.. But the sides left something to be desired (except the hush puppies). Maybe next time will try a baked potato or fries instead. Service was great. Cash only! Prices were great. We got all the food above (2 sandwiches and 3 sides) for $13!"}
{"text":"I call in for a BBQ sandwich to-go whenever I'm working in the area.  Everything else just ok.  Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I love Kyle Fletcher's!! This has to me some of the best BBQ I've had. You get a TON of food on a plate and it is still incredibly cheap!   I ordered what I usually get, which is a chopped pork plate. It comes with hush puppies, fries, beans, coleslaw and the delicious BBQ. Kyle Fletcher's has two sauces on the table. One vinegar type and one more saucy type, both are delicious. We didn't have it this time, but they also have great banana pudding.   Remember, it's cash only! It is also consistently slammed during the lunch hour. We went around 2 on this trip and it was still packed. Definitely worth it though. So delicious and a hell of a bargain."}
{"text":"I love going to new barbecue places when I'm in the South so I looked forward to trying out this winner of a recent Charlotte Observer contest.  The chopped barbecue was good but not as tender as it might have been, perhaps earning a B+.  The slaw was great as were the hush puppies.  Just an aside, if your hush puppies come round like golf balls, they can tend to be doughy on the inside, if they come as Fletcher's do shaped more like a small straightened croissant, then you've got the real thing.  The dining room was small and you will likely wait for a table but the decor is fun UNC-Chapel Hill memorabilia so be careful who you take there by double-checking their alma mater.  The Duke graduate's digestion will not be enhanced by the surroundings."}
{"text":"Kyle's is a rather small place and only takes cash.  The parking lot is small and only accessible from the westbound lanes (the highway is divided).  However....  The food is really good and both the portions and price are quite fantastic.  I can feed my family (2A, 3K) less than 25 bucks.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the inconveniences of size and cash only.  Otherwise, it's quite solid."}
{"text":"This is another great locally owned and operated barbecue joint, not fine dining, smallish dining area and they do a lot of carry out too.  What I like about them the most is they do authentic BBQ, cooked with wood. Plus they do a good spare rib too. The spare ribs come without sauce so you can add the couple of sauces they have or apply your own! All their side dishes are good too. I cannot imagine you being disappointed. I cook my own Q but sometimes you just want to eat and not cook, so I will go their first. The atmosphere is sports, with lots of decoration on the walls."}
{"text":"CLICK HERE FOR MENU...  I don't know how the girl at the register handles the front end; the waiting area is tiny, yet the cashier is so friendly and orderly.  Wish they'd put a small awning out in front, to handle the overflow of customers waiting for their orders...  Now that that's out of the way:  the food is great; tastiest BBQ there is (and I choose Kyle Fletchers over restaurants that are closer to my home).  Everything is scratch made, including the fries and onion rings.  Great BBQ, good people, and a good value.  Cash only."}
{"text":"They've got pretty decent barbecue, and amazing chili cheese fries. It's all pretty cheaply priced but you have to have cash so be prepared. Also there's no hostess so it's sort of honor system based on who's there first as to who's getting a table and if you're not standing and ready someone WILL snipe a table from you. They make massive burgers and have excellent tea and lemonade. The only reason they don't have 5 stars is for two reasons: -the nauseating UNC Chapel Hill decor -and when I ordered chili cheese fries to go for lunch one day, there was no chili. It was just burger meat crumbled up with no seasoning on top of the fries with cheese masking it. I was so sad. :( I loved those chili cheese fries I dined in on once before but was very let down by that to go order. They didn't seem busy so idk what excuse they could have. I'll just have to give it a try again later!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! Terrific prices, great portions. Hush puppies are awesome. Chili cheese fries are very good. Bbq is wonderfully flavored and delicious. I even love the baked beans. Onion rings are extremely tasty.  The only con is the size of the place. But come early and hungry!"}
{"text":"This is as close to eastern North Carolina BBQ you can buy without going to Goldsboro or Kinston, NC(sorry Lexington). The BBQ is so rich and smoky and not seasoned too mush. They allow you, the diner, to add as much or little sauce, salt, or pepper as you like. I love it and it reminds of my two favorite BBQ eateries, McCall's in Goldsboro and King's BBQ in Kinston, NC.   The great thing about Kyle Fletcher's is they have world famous hamburgers as well!!! They are to die for, no lie!!! The place has very affordable prices and a pound of BBQ is just like 7.99. The only thing I don't like is they have no family pack deals. You have to buy everything sepertately."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town.  Hickory smoked BBQ with fresh slaw,  fries,  and onion rings.  Great for take out. Seating is small for dine in."}
{"text":"Went here with co-workers based on some locals recommendations. I will break it down like this:  Yes its a hole in the wall and very small, we had to wait Yes its beloved by the locals, who have grown used to the taste Yes they only take cash Yes the service was great Yes the cooks were skinny....  Yes the beans and slaw were good and the tea sweet No the BBQ was not good, not in the least  Skinny cooks that should of been my warning sign. If the two guys in the kitchen are skinny something is not right. The BBQ was honestly just terrible, it was dry, it had no smoke flavor of any sort. What it did taste like was propane you can tell that was how they cooked the hog. Now that way will work if you shield the hog and season it while cooking, they did neither. Really disappointing.   If I go back I will have the hamburger like others have recommended."}
{"text":"**BE WARNED: KYLE'S IS CASH ONLY!!! (I always forget. So, don't make my repeated mistake. Be prepared!)  Okay, so, I know that BBQ is in the name. And the BBQ at Kyle Fletcher's is fine and dandy. But, y'all. Here's the big secret:The Kyle Fletcher's Cheeseburger is WHERE. IT'S. AT. But, be prepared to do some work because it's also gigantic... (And their bacon is amazing, too, if you're feeling a little sassy and ambitious with your meal! Hushpuppies, too.)  The staff of Kyle's is always friendly and serivce is, typically, prompt. It's the down-home, local kind of place where everyone seems to know one another, there are laminated menus on the table, and the food is consistently great & goes unchanged! It's filled with nostalgia for locals and tons of wonderful options for those just driving through and looking for something local and delicious!"}
{"text":"The owner's daughter was our server!  Sorry, I forgot her name!  While visiting North Carolina for the first time, I had to try their bbq , hushpuppies, cole slaw, beans...  it was so delicious!!!   I love southern food and this was the best!!!   Our server was beyond friendly, attentive, has such great personality, we felt welcomed and a great atmosphere around us!  Family's all around .....  Interior was very nice ...."}
{"text":"The pulled pork has great smokey flavor and I like their regular bbq sauce. Prices are great for the amount of food. Most waitresses are friendly and helpful. The restaurant has looked the same since I was born and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. ;)"}
{"text":"Best real deal BBQ I've had in Charlotte area, rated just above Indian Land's 521 BBQ. You'd better have cash or a personal check since they don't take cards. I love the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with cole slaw (on the sandwich), fries, and sweet tea Arnold Palmer to wash it all down."}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall BBQ restaurant that serves up big flavor. The most amazing onion rings I have ever ate."}
{"text":"We decided to try Fletcher's because of their recent victory in the local BBQ contest. The menu was misleading. The sliced BBQ was actually sliced pork loin. In addition, the BBQ beef was shredded. The menu should indicate this. The chopped BBQ was lean and served without being drenched in sauce. This was appreciated. The pork had an odd flavor and smell as if the meat had been cooked over burning trash or paper instead of a good rich wood. The sides were very good and the food was moderately priced. I would suggest that you try Fletcher's. There is a lot of potential here. Not the best yet. Credit cards not accepted."}
{"text":"After many locals told me to go there many times I finally went and then came back for more several times. Really good flavor pulled/sliced/chopped pork and burgers with or without cheese and good different bacon. Hush puppies coleslaw are good and done right. Very large portions, you'll never leave here hungry and may have leftovers. Cash only and limited seating so try not lunch/dinner peak hours but it's also good as takeout. My go to place for good NC BBQ at very affordable prices. Oh and sweet tea is good too."}
{"text":"BBQ is pretty good, one of the better locally. Tea is good, burgers good. Now for the bad: It's 2018 and we live in a modern, developed, first world economy. It's 2018, need to get a credit card machine and open on what would be one of their busiest and probably most profitable days, Sunday. Good at bbq, down home cooking. Business acumen not so much. It's not what you want it's what your custs want."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Gastonia I try to stop. Portions are great and the BBQ is my favorite style. Wait can be bad, but usually I will call my order in and pick it up."}
{"text":"Last weekend after work, I hopped on I-85 heading towards the mountains of western North Carolina to judge in Franklin, NC.  I couldn't for the life of me decide where I should stop for dinner.  One of my co-workers mentioned that I should try Kyle Fletcher's BBQ in Gastonia, NC.  Sure, why not?  Kyle's is the quintessential barbecue joint.  It's literally a little hole-in-the-wall building.  Parking is very much at a premium.  Kyle's only accepts cash (so make sure that you make an ATM visit before stopping here).  Seating is done based on the honor system where everyone seats themselves.  And finally, when you step inside, you will have no doubts whatsoever that you are in a North Carolina BBQ joint -- the interior decor is covered in all things UNC and NASCAR.  After browsing the menu, I decided on a large BBQ plate with hush puppies, fries, baked beans, and slaw (which ran about $7).  Naturally, I had sweet tea to drink (and quite a lot of it that night -- I was really thirsty).  About 5-10 minutes after ordering, my food came out.  The slaw was a finely chopped slaw.  It was a faint pink color, caused from (I believe) mixing BBQ sauce into a white slaw mixture.  It had a nice balance of sweet and tang to it while maintaining a good texture.  The beans were nice and bold, although I would've liked to have seen some green bell pepper or onion in the beans.  The fries were nothing special, quite frankly, and the hush puppies were above average.  The pork was very moist and flavorful.  The consistency of the meat was between a coarse pull and a chop, so there was some texture retained.  There was a definite smoke flavor to the meat.  I also tried the pork with their two sauces -- a sweet tomato-based sauce and a vinegar-based sauce that was supposed to be hot.  The vinegar-based sauce was not as hot as I thought it would be and did not add much flavor to the meat.  The tomato-based sauce, however, was quite excellent and would work well on any sort of meat.  So is this joint worth a repeat visit?  I'd say so.  And judging by the crowd I experienced when I was there, others are probably thinking the same thing.  Only reason I rated it lower was from the inconveniences of cash only and limited parking.

{"text":"I come here a lot. The food is amazing! I always get a burger! Staff is super friendly, just a great atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"The food and service are great, but come early during the week if you want to find a seat without waiting (Space is limited).  The barbecue is good, but I can't get past the cheeseburger (which I generally order).  Regular size is big enough for most people, but if you are hungry a large should be plenty.  Make sure to bring cash, as they don't accept credit cards.  I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Kyle Fletcher's has good food, but it is the atmosphere, price, and service that will have you coming back. When I walked into this locally owned joint I felt like I had been taken back to Chapel Hill. The place is covered with pictures of the venerable Dean Smith, the unforgettable Michael Jordan, and the class act James Worthy. There are old Tar Heels posters, small little UNC trinkets and pics of players and coaches strewn throughout the place. As a graduate of UNC Chapel-Hill, I loved it and I have to admit it may have influenced my feelings about this place.   I know that this place can be extremely busy during the lunch hours, so I held off until about 1:30. By the time I walked in my stomach was growling, but it was worth the wait because I was seated right away. Keep in mind that this place is very small and quite popular. The parking lot is also limited, so take all of this into account on planning your meal. Also, this place is old school so it's *CASH ONLY.*   As I said, I was seated right away and soon after was enthusiastically greeted by a member of the wait staff to take my drink order. I got the sweet tea of course and I made the right decision. Usually family owned BBQ joints get the tea right, and Kyle Fletcher's was no exception.   I decided to order the Small Chopped Pork Plate, which was only $6. This was an incredible price considering that it comes with pork BBQ, baked beans, cole slaw, hush puppies, and french fries. I was even more impressed when they brought out the heaping amount of food. I can't even imagine what the large plate looks like.   I tasted the BBQ before adding any slaw or sauce and was honestly disappointed. It had a really good smoky flavor to it, but it was dry. I added the sauce and slaw to it and tried it again. It obviously was much better. The slaw was sweet and moist without being watery and the sauce was very good. I tried the Eastern NC vinegar style sauce. It  actually had a really good heat to it. Some places seem to hold back on the spiciness, but Kyle Fletcher's brought it. The hushpuppies were good and the french fries were above average. I was stuffed after sucking down all of this food and was thankful that I decided just to get the small plate.   Kyle Fletcher's is a good small town, family owned, BBQ joint with a great atmosphere, and friendly service. There is better BBQ out there, but this got knocked up to 4 stars for me because of the side items, the sauce, the atmosphere, and the service. This is based on one visit, so maybe next time the BBQ will impress me more."}
{"text":"This is the best pulled pork bbq in the Charlotte metro area.  The burgers and onion rings are awesome too.   It's also a charming hole in the wall (unless you're a Duke fan) with a super friendly wait staff.  But be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is a whole in the wall place with great food at pretty cheap prices. They have really good onion rings. They have bbq slaw that isn't as good as RO's but overall the food is better. The ribs are so good they don't need sauce. Simple pork bbq sandwich is perfect. I put both the spicy vinegar based sauce and the tomato bbq sauce on it. My dad loves the hamburgers, and they are huge, but I prefer mine less done. They cook their burgers well done, but my dad says they are still juicy!  It's small and can get busy on weekend nights. There is no hostess, people just keep track of who is next in line and seat themselves when a table opens up. Cash only."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've worked so close to here for so long and never been here! The food was delicious!!! I've had the wings, pulled pork plate and banana pudding. First off the prices are so reasonable! But goodness the food is so tasteful! The BBQ slaw was really and the beans are great! To top it all off.... the guest service was well above and beyond! Can't wait to dine here again! Please stop in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Kyle Fletcher's is a small town barbecue place that will keep you coming back for more! It's almost always crowded with regulars, and has the best food in town. It is small, so it's \"first come, first serve.\"   If you want some good, southern sweet tea and barbecue or burgers, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Lowell, NC. OK, it's a favorite in Gaston County as well. If it's lunch time and I'm nearby, then I'll probably stop in here. My favorite here is their banana pudding. I like their pork and I'm a huge fan of their smoked turkey.  If you arrive here at or close to lunch time, you'll find yourself standing in a line. It's not a large restaurant, seating is limited. Also, you need to bring cash. Also, be prepared to be hit in the face with South Point High School stuff along with UNC!  This trip I had pork, baked beans, slaw, fries and hush puppies; the standard offering. I finished with banana pudding, you didn't think I'd leave that off, did you?  The Pulled and Chopped Pork  This is good stuff, is it the best I've had? No, but it's good stuff. Their process leaves the meat a little drier than I prefer; but it comes to you without sauce. This allows you add sauce as you like. Their sauce helps compliment the meat, and it doesn't kill the nice smoke hit the meat took in. They do have a nice vinegar sauce and there is a thicker Eastern NC style sweet sauce. My preference is to not put the thick stuff on pulled pork.  The Sides Bake Beans I like their baked beans. However, I also like to take some of the pork and put it into the beans. I think it makes them better. The Slaw The slaw is nothing special. You'll note from the picture that it's swimming in BBQ Sauce, I like to do that with any white slaw. I prefer doing that to getting the Barbecue Slaw. The French fries Really nothing special. So un-special that I don't waste the calories on them. They're not bad or horrible, just not special Hush Puppies I like their hush puppies. But then I do like hush puppies.  The banana pudding Piece de resistance ... yeah that's right, this is good stuff. One of the better banana pudding's you'll find. No good barbecue place should be without this dessert! And it's great when I find a really good banana pudding. This here folks is a really good one."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Gastonia! Large portions as well. Cash only and seating is limited. Worth all that in deed!"}
{"text":"Lunch. Tuesday, March 19. 12:30 PM.  Upon arrival, the parking lot was full, as was the parking lot for the adjacent business. As I circled the full parking lot, I passed someone tending a heavily smoking barbecue in the rear of the building - very promising. Barbecue smoke aroma is one of my favorite smells!   I followed two of North Carolina's finest, NCHP, officers into the building. Hole in the wall is an apt description. I'll bet the place doesn't seat 40 people.  There were no seats available so we had to wait at the almost nonexistent foyer for the first available.   One of the patrolmen said hello, and in replying I mentioned that this was my first visit to Kyle Fletcher's BBQ. He said that he eats here twice weekly, and although the BBQ was \"good,\" he said that he usually orders the hamburger. I thanked him, and he and his partner were seated in less than two minutes. I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited - probably twenty minutes for someone to get up so that I could be seated. There are only four chairs in the front entrance to wait and get out of everyone's way.    (By the way, if you are a NC State basketball fan, this place will make you crazy. A large portion of the walls and ceiling are dedicated to UNC basketball, Dean Smith, etc. I was raised watching Carolina basketball in the 60's, when they were legitimately the best team in the United States most years, so I actually liked the decor.)  I noticed that the sanitation rating is 98.0.  I finally grabbed a booth, and the waitress cleaned off the table for me PDQ. That was the highlight of the dining experience, it was all down hill from there.   I ordered the small sliced pork plate, which is supposed to come with meat, slaw, fries, hush puppies, and baked beans. I opted out of the beans because I'm allergic, and I upgraded the fries to onion rings, for an additional eighty cents. (I saw onion rings on several other tables and they looked good.) I ordered lemonade for a change from sweet iced tea.   For some reason, the waitress had a hard time understanding that I didn't want beans, and this seemed to blow her mind. She came back almost immediately and asked if I wanted lemon in the tea that she was about to serve me. What? I said, \"no, I ordered lemonade.\" Massive eye roll from the sixty something waitress. I guess that it was my fault that she couldn't remember my drink order for all of fifteen seconds, not a good sign.  I waited for my food for probably fifteen to twenty minutes, even though the restaurant was now emptying out, and everyone had their food. It seemed like an eternity. When my food finally arrived, here's what was presented to me: five pieces of pale, strange looking, sliced barbecue. (If you've ever eaten at Sonny's BBQ, it was the same product, although not as well executed as Sonny's.) I received a separate tray of onion rings. Two scrawny, scraggly, tiny, pathetic hush puppies. ZERO SLAW. Lemonade that tasted like some cheap, watery, grocery store product. I make better lemonade from lemon juice, water, and artificial sweetener at home. I decided not to complain because, (a) I wasn't \"that\" hungry, and (b) I had little faith that my waitress could provide the correct order.   Barbecue sauce options: (a) Eastern NC. Thin, WATERY, vinegary \"sauce,\" and I use the term sauce loosely, with red pepper flakes. I poured it on the barbecue and it immediately all flowed off - imparting zero taste, and no heat. Worst eastern style BBQ sauce that I've ever encountered. (b) Western NC sauce. Thicker, sweeter, more ketchupy, but not very good.   The sliced pork barbecue? Hmmm. What confuses me is that there was a pink smoke ring, so it looked semi-legit, but there was no taste, no smoke, no nothin'. It was also borderline dry. I should have ordered chopped barbecue instead, I guess. The only other person that I saw who ordered barbecue order chopped, and it looked good - from a distance.   The onion rings were fairly good, but they paled in comparison to the panko breaded onion rings from both McKoy's Smokehouse in Charlotte and Judge's Express BBQ in Hickory. Even Sauceman's and Ranucci's have far better rings.   The hush puppies? Who serves TWO teeny, scrawny hush puppies? You people are trippin'.   I was also disappointed that I didn't get to sample the slaw, THAT I ORDERED, but it appeared to be the fine minced stuff put onto sandwiches, so it was probably no big loss.   My waitress, Ms. Eye-roll, committed the cardinal sin of letting my cup go completely dry. Sheesh! Just before I arose to get my own refill, a different waitress came by and refilled my cup.   I noticed that almost everyone was eating the hamburger and onion rings. If I ever ate here again, that's what I would order, but since I am not going to eat here again, it is immaterial.   The bill was over $10, which was about three dollars more than I expected, and about $8 more than the food was worth."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The inside is very small but smelled delicious. I was excited but then saw the cash only sign on the cash register. Who carries cash on them in 2015? I turned around and walked out. Massive fail ."}
{"text":"I grew up with this BBQ!  This was the traditional meal after the win in high school.  It brings back so many memories.  The place is a Tar Heel haven!  They have a couple of things from other schools but if you're not a Heel fan then stay out!  Kidding, they will give you a day pass.  Their BBQ is very flavorful either pork or beef.  They have different sauces to choose from so they have you covered.  The burgers are out of this world.  They are huge!  Juicy, hot, and the type that the juices will run down your arms if you are not careful.  I have not been in a while but it seems to never change.  It is a very small place and parking can sometimes be an issue during lunch or on the weekends but it is well worth it.  Just remember to bring cash or a check unless they have changed to accept cards recently but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged if you have to wait for a table. It's totally worth it! Had the BBQ the first time we went and it was good. This time I had the fried turkey sandwich ... Wow what a massive sandwich! You have to ask for it, it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow! What a phenomenal barbecue sandwich! Today was my first day being at Kyle Fletcher's."}
{"text":"The BBQ is great at Kyle Fletcher's and the styrofoam cups for your tea (I had a huge X on mine since I went unsweetened) is how I know the south.  There is a ton of Pittsburg Steelers memorabilia and you should ask the waitress/waiter why. Pretty interesting story.  My one beef is they only take cash. It's 2015, you should be able to take cards. It is a little small inside, but I'm use to small restaraunt so it's not a big deal for me.  Side note: they sell t-shirts that on the back say \"GET PORKED.\" Makes a hilarious gift."}
{"text":"Small place big Taste!  Place is small and I think someone might be a UNC fan! Parking is a little tricky but well worth it. Portions are big and great, I had a chopped pork plate and you could taste the smoke in the meat.   My wife said the slaw was great on her sandwich also, hush puppies some of the best I have had.   The onion rings was great also and get a ton with the order. Everyone was friendly but remember cash only!"}
{"text":"come here for the chopped pork meal.  it comes with chopped pork, hush puppies, coleslaw, baked beans, and fries, all for a reasonable price.  the barbecue was delicious, the chopped pork had bits of the outside bark mixed in which added a nice flavor and texture.  there are two different types of barbecue sauces on the table, one vinegar based with red pepper flake, and another that is a tomato based, sweeter sauce.    the side dishes were pretty good, nothing too spectacular.  they give you a large portion for a modest price.  the service was very good, the waitresses were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Good ole country barbecue that comes with baked beans, french fries, hush puppies and barbecue slaw!  Always consistent and very good Fixin's!  We ate so much and were absolutely stuffed to the gills!!  Even though I gorged myself, I will come back for more pain and suffering ( which was caused by my inability to stop. Ha! )  Just a note, if you plan on eating here they only accept cash or checks! No credit or debit cards"}
{"text":"While this may be a good drive from the Charlotte area, about 15-20 min, it's well worth it. If you're a BBQ fan & you're looking to find some locally owned places with some of the best stuff, then head towards Gastonia to check it out.  This place is always packed, but you shouldn't have to wait too long to grab a table. It's a small building, so you're crammed in there with plenty of other people clamoring to get their hands on good BBQ. I've been here plenty of times, & have really only looked at the menu once, so that tells you just order the BBQ plate. For about $5, you'll get an order of BBQ, slaw, & hushpuppies, & it will be one of the greatest lunch time meals you'll have. The BBQ, combined with their homemade sauce is out of this world. Taking into consideration both the BBQ & sauce, this is the best BBQ joint I've ever been to.  Not only is the food 2nd to none, but the atmosphere makes it all that much better. It's locally owned & still has that personal touch feel about it. The walls are covered with ACC memorabilia, mainly the good ole Tar Heels, which gives it a hometown feel as well.  Everything about Kyle Fletcher's is great, except maybe the fact that it's cash only. I have no idea why they haven't given in to the debit card take over, so just remember to bring your cash with you.  Other than the cash only, this is the best BBQ joint in the area that I've been to. I can't see it getting much better anywhere else, but if you've got a suggestion let me know cause I love me some BBQ. So head out of the big city for once & grab some small town BBQ that will make you glad you made the trip."}
{"text":"First time visit yesterday around 4pm.  I will be back!  I had the large pulled pork basket with onion rings and hush puppies.  The portions were very generous.  Everything tasted delicious.  My order came out promptly.  The waitress checked on me regularly.  I'm looking forward to coming back and having a burger."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended to us from a local resident. We're so glad we made the 45 minute drive there. The parking lot was full on that early Saturday afternoon. Seating is at a premium because the restaurant isn't very spacious but the turn over of tables seemed pretty good. There were a lot of people carrying out as did we. The ribs we got were the best we've ever had! They were smokey, juicy, tender yumminess!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is the best in town! Hush puppies are hard to beat also. Seating is limited so make sure to beat the crowds. Keep in mind you will need cash as they do not accept cards"}
{"text":"No reason to drive to Lexington any longer and boy if you're hungry you sure won't be when you leave. Ever been to the Beacon in Spartanburg?  Well somehow the onion rings wound up here. Pure bliss and good to the last bite. Great prices, service and food"}
{"text":"3 stars based on my first visit today. This place is certainly popular as it was very crowded. We ordered a large pulled pork plate and a large beef plate. WARNING the portions are large, we should have ordered the small. The beef was dry and lacked a smokey flavor to it. I definitely will not order that again. The pork was moist but only had a hint of smokiness. We would like to try the ribs or burgers next time. The waitress raved about the burgers. By the way, we saw the burgers and they too are huge! The onion rings were very good, the coleslaw was just so so.This was not the best BBQ that we have ever had, but not the worst either. We will give it another try"}
{"text":"This is the iconic 'real deal' BBQ place. If you have anyone coming in from out of town that has never experienced North Carolina BBQ, this is where you want to take them. The fleet of smokers are right there behind the building. Not only does this place have fantastic BBQ, they also have some of the best burgers you will ever have. I messed up and got the large double cheese burger and I couldn't finish it. Pro tip: If you get there early get a couple bags of the pork skins. They run out quick!"}
{"text":"Best burgers around. Period. And you'll never finish a double. It's just too huge! But it's so delicious you'll sure try to pound it down. Hometown food. Friendly family atmosphere. Kyle Fletcher's is on our list of weekly eat out places. Never had a bad experience. Food is always phenomenal."}
{"text":"Food smells great! I've went there twice & still haven't ate there. 1st time I didn't see the small sign on the door, cash only, you have all now been warned bring cash, if you wanna eat. 2nd time, I brought cash, placed my Togo order, waited in 1 of the 4 seats to wait in. Being asked by everyone coming in the door if \" I'm waiting on a table. \" I've never said no more in one day. After 40 min. Passed I noticed families had come in ate & we're leaving. I decided to ask about my order.. who knows maybe they actually have to catch the pigs at this place. The hostess \"black hair\" realized she hadn't even taken my order to the kitchen. I got my money & ran. I would really love to try this food, however until the customer service is that of a  better quality restaurant, I don't see thuis place getting any better. You have been warned!! It's not not rocket science... it's just bbq, in gastonia... it should be pretty easy to serve everyone."}
{"text":"I get BBQ'd out with all of the fundraisers around here, but Kyle Fletcher's is hands-down the best BBQ in Gaston County. The hushpuppies are SO good. The place is packed all the time and for good reason! Prices are fair, but make sure you hit the ATM because it's cash only! Rookie mistake on my part. Parking can be tricky too. I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. Did catering for a birthday party and could have scaled back on what they recommended per the number of people we were having. We wasted a ton of food. Other than that - good food, good service, fair prices, BEST BBQ!"}
{"text":"Standing room only until tables opened up, which is always a good sign.  Chopped pork was fantastic, as were the onion rings and slaw. The sliced beef was just OK - was expecting it to be brisket.  Huge portions overall.  Will definitely be back if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"We used Kyle Fletcher's for a 60th birthday party this weekend.  Brian was my contact at the restaurant. He arrived early, set up the food, and was a great source of information.  I highly recommend them for their BBQ (everybody said it was the best they had eaten) and for their courteous service.  Very unusual in this era of no customer service.  Thanks Brian!"}
{"text":"Have only been once since moving here but BBQ was delicious! They've been open for 18 years so they are doing things right! Little one got a fried bologna sandwich and the Bologna was close than inch thick! Onion rings were fantastic! Only cash and closed Monday's."}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ, ribs and burgers... it's a must stop for all!!! Staff is super friendly and so helpful!"}
{"text":"My territory runs from Memphis to Miami and North to Maryland. Every time I find a new BBQ place to try I order their ribs. If they are good I will return.  Won't be going back here..."}
{"text":"Bbq is excellent as well as the burgers, however, my favorite are definitely the onion rings! The best I've found yet I think! Everyone is very friendly and the service is usually pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Delicious food and you get a great amount.  Try mixing the tomato based sauce with the vinegar based sauce. Mmmmm. And they have two types of slaw. Barbecue is their main fare but the sandwiches are great too!"}
{"text":"So--Ive just moved down south, and have been introduced to the Carolina BBQ debates (personally I prefer North Carolina BBQ over South Carolina BBQ, but its still pretty good too--Kansas City BBQ is my top favorite).   Kyle Fletcher's is the best BBQ I've had in both Carolinas. It's definitely a real BBQ joint (cash only). I've only gotten the small chopped pork, but its so good, why get anything else? The onion rings are worth stopping by for alone. AMAZING ONION RINGS.  I didn't care for the hush puppies, but I don't like them anyways. As I'm getting older, if I need to eat something breaded and fried, I'm not wasting my allowance on hush puppies.   Prepare to see lots of crap about UNC and Nascar."}
