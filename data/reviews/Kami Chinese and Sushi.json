{"text":"Chinese food in the whole Charlotte area for the most part is pretty bad but Kami's is surprisingly good. They actually just remodeled and added Thai which I haven't tried yet but the sushi and the Chinese items are quite tasty. It's Chinese American style so it's not authentic Chinese but even Dim Sum on Central isn't all that authentic either (my Grandfather came over from Canton and owned several Chinese restaurants). The service has also always been good so I'm not sure about the previous reviewers, but it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Looking for great tasting and reasonable Asian food and found it. Singapore Mei Fun very good, flavorful, and General Tso's spicy and the  Pad Thai excellent, flavorful. Not bland. Nice looking place. Plus hostesses are stunning. Good find. Will keep going."}
{"text":"Don't order the chicken pad thai here. It is horrible. The onion is too strong and just has a really odd flavor. First time I have ever sent something back.  Only gave two stars because the shrimp tempura was good."}
{"text":"I always want this place to be good since I live nearby. Periodically I give it a chance and I usually end up disappointed.  I am giving  a third star only because their takeout  is decent enough. That is, of course, assuming you order the regular Chinese staples (General Tso's is decent, pot stickers are pretty good).  But for dine-in, they're lucky they don't have competition nearby."}
{"text":"Very tasty and nice food presentation. Teriyaki salmon, Philadelphia roll, California roll, egg roll, spring roll, hot and sour soup, General Tsao's chicken were all yummy and better quality than most local restaurants. Kid friendly food as well."}
{"text":"Kami never fails to satisfy my appetite! I have no clue why Kami doesn't get better ratings, it is so delicious. The prices are completely doable and the food quality is amazing. They have great sushi, but the best way to see what Kami is all about is to get the benton box. This way you can pick 4 items to try. I will say that their waiters don't all have the greatest English, but they never ever get your order wrong, they still check on you and fill your drinks etc adequately. I would recommend Kami to ANYONE."}
{"text":"In a shopping center. Moderate to small dining room. Expensive, Take Out was slow."}
{"text":"Not so good, mediocre at best. I only get food here if I really need Thai takeout because it's the only place in a 10 mile radius. Kinda low quality food, definitely overpriced, and in a somewhat convenient location. If you're looking for a place to sit down, find somewhere better, and if you're looking to takeout, just get a pizza. I really don't recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The place was nice, but it could have been a bit cleaner. The reason that I give one star is the customer service, it is horrible! The waitress seemed to have no personality and to get something from them was like pulling teeth."}
{"text":"Love the food, just not the prices.  We've ordered from here since they opened a bit over 10 years ago and the food is always good.  The fantasy shrimp is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Kami's! I tried the sushi rolls, pad thai noodles, and the bento box.  Even the delivery is spot on and the salad is perfect.  I love the interior design of the place and also the outside! I had lunch outside with my friend and it was perfect.  The service was great and I would definitely recommend it! The food is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Don't have to come back here. Sushi was terrible. Supposedly tuna??? Nothing but mush! Not sure what they mixed it with?!"}
{"text":"Just got lunch special - general tsao's. Chicken is grizzle - hardly any meat inside deep fried crud. Fried rice sub par and  I didn't want rice filling up 2/3's of my styrofoam box. Rice had no pork in pork fried rice. Basically rice with soy sauce poured on it. Egg roll greasy inside. Relocated here from NYC - man I miss good Chinese food. The stuff down here is gross. Should have gone to Subway for a sub par sub"}
{"text":"This place is not what I expected. We are vegetarians and the food tasted like nothing when we ordered it vegetarian. Our pad Thai tasted very stale to us and the sushi we ordered didn't taste like what we wanted. In my opinion this place isn't very good and I wouldn't go a second time."}
{"text":"Been coming here or getting takeout from here consistently for the last 6+ years it seems.  It's always our standby. Really good sushi and other Asian recipes and the staff is always so friendly. Really nothing bad to say about it at all."}
{"text":"Bottom line, the food is bad, the prices are mediocre and the wait staff is terrible.  The simple fact is that they are pretty much the only Chinese place for miles is what keeps this place open."}
{"text":"Sushi was great, Chinese okay, not fantastic but not bad either. Prices high...more expensive than NY for just okay food..."}
{"text":"So I've said time and time again that I wish we had more closer and I've seen this place and told the hubby we need to stop so friends who are new to the area as well decided to invite us here for their daughter bday dinner.  The service here SUCKS, I don't like to knock young teenagers working as I have a teenager and she is very professional and have worked in service. However the teenagers here don't understand the concept of customer service.  The food was tasty (I don't eat seafood anymore/ haven't ate meat in 10 years besides seafood but I'm a Vegan now) and everyone enjoyed in our group. It did take us a while to obtain our food and we had to call the server over several times to get simple logical things like napkins and water refills and drink refills.  It's nice to have a place close by but they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Expensive but still the best Chinese in Waxhaw Weddington area. Sushi is awesome too."}
{"text":"We ate here once and will never return. The staff was friendly, that's the only reason for two stars instead of one. The food was actually really gross and I wasn't able to eat what I ordered. I just wanted to leave, but waiting for the check to arrive took forever. The service is extremely slow. We paid, left our entire meals behind, and have never returned."}
{"text":"Love the dumplings, chicken lettuce wraps, fried chicken wings!  Checking it out. Had the dumplings and they were very good and tasted fresh. Trying some other dishes today."}
{"text":"I love kami, the sushi is very good and the service is always friendly. I have never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"Freaking incredible. We moved to Charlotte from Wesley Chapel 3 years ago. We only head back out that way to eat the bento box here at Kami. Well worth the trip and not that expensive. Sushi selection is great and good as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service. We've been here about 10 times. For sushi- dynamite roll, Weddington roll are both great. Quiet inside to sit down and eat but still family friendly. Thankful to have this option in Weddington area."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant to eat at, I ordered the Fantasy Shrimp Bento Box and the Beach sushi roll  and my husband ordered the sesame chicken Bento box and the crunchy California roll. Everything was delicious and the service was awesome, we highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years. Their chicken lo mein is my favorite. It is high quality Chinese food, but not overly expensive."}
{"text":"Since moving to the area we've been here a number of times. The place impressed me at first, however lately it seen the food has become a bit normal and giving you the wow factor.   Sushi is decent not great, and the hot food is ok. I'd pass this one by until they updated the inside and maybe add or change the menu a bit."}
{"text":"Love it I go every Wednesday  with my friends to eat!! great Service tasty food that can make you full in seconds. Large variety of choices  that all taste great. Only problem is prices but I guess with the amount you spend there comes with great service, food, and more"}
{"text":"New Management and Staff = Bad food, bad service and a totally bad attitude. We have been going here once a week or so for years. Food was usuallly fairlly good. But now there is a new owner and the entire staff seems to have turned over. Tonight's meal was brought out wrong items, twice, and each timet the waitress argued that we had order what they brought. Wehen we said no we did not she said she would have to ask the manager's permission to bring us what we actually ordered. When we finally got the food it was inedible. I mean it was so far away from what I had in the past with the same dish and so bad that I didn't eat it. I let my watress know i was unhappy and I asked for the manager and she never bothered to come over. It's not that she was busy, she just couldn't be bothered. When I caught her on the way out she told me that i was wrong that the dish that I order once a week was always prepared that way and that I clearly didn't understand what I was ordering. I told her I oreder this all the time and it was never inedible before and she just argued with me. No apology, no interest in trying to make me feel even one bit better. Just arguements and attitude.   When things go wrong I try to understand and be as polite about it as I can. I expect that the servers and the manager will actually care that they made mistakes. Not even close to that here, not one little bit.   Not sure I will ever go back. Worst experience in a restaurant in YEARS!"}
{"text":"Ok they are all right about the service.  The Asian Michael Jackson host and his staff DO give you the feeling that they want you to leave as soon as possible.  But don't let that stop you from doing take out.  The food is good and that's what counts."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are a lot of poor reviews.  I've been eating here for 5 years and I think they are the best around.  Very consistent.  I've ordered take out from them at least 50 times and they only messed up once and they gave me 25 % off.  Great place."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is good because it's not cooked too sweet. It's a good restaurant with some serious cuisine.I think it deserved a five star in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Thursday evening at Kami.  Excellent service and good food.  We had an all vegetarian bento box and one with spicy tuna roll, fried rice, Thai spring roll, Thai chicken and cashew.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The previous reviewer is right about the service. The host is a young guy that doesn't seem too interested in being there. I've been there a couple of times and always get a waiter/waitress that doesn't speak English very well, making ordering difficult. Especially if you have questions about the menu. They are polite, in an awkward way.  The food is good. I usually order sushi (the closest sushi place near my house) and it's always very good. My wife ordered the pepper steak last time and loved it.  I like the decor of the restaurant. It's very comfortable with music at a reasonable volume. Very clean and organized.  Bottom line: Great food ... could-be-better service."}
{"text":"We just tried Kami for the first time today. The food was awesome. My husband got a Bento Box and I had the House Special Mei Fun. I would say my Mei Fun was some of the best I've ever eaten!  The atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly. Nice to know we have a good Chinese Thai Sushi restaurant right in our backyard!!"}
{"text":"The service really turned me off from this place, the host is always the same guy and he doesn't show a lick of human emotion in his face.  I thought he could have at least appeared to enjoy his job.  The restaurant itself is pretty clean and peaceful.  The wait staff is very attentive, but not really personable.  The food itself was actually really good though, I had the veggie lo-mein and my friend tried the peppersteak.  I thought it was pretty great they mixed plenty of different kinds of peppers together and everything was fresh.  The quantity of the food was really lacking though, I left hungry.  That is ridiculous for a Chinese place, I usually have to leave with a box."}
{"text":"So I order dinner for five I asked for tea bags they wanted to charge me 50 cents a piece that's not bad enough the won ton soup had the outside onion skin in it the wings were not even wings  And to boot the Health score is 94 thinking it is time to find a new place  Total Disappointment all around"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Americanized Chinese and old sushi.  Even our two kids have taken this one off the list.  There are SO many better choices within a 15 min drive.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"The sushi is delish! So is every dish we have tried! Every time I call in an order, they have it correct and ready when I come to pick it up."}
{"text":"Kami's has always been our go-to place for Chinese take-out because of the close proximity to our home and their great prices for lunch.  The food was always good, but we really didn't love it.  However, they have recently revamped their menu and have added a few new dishes, bento boxes, and more Thai selections that we really like.  The Thai is really just \"ok\", so don't get too excited, but the Bento boxes are really good and their new \"Wedding Roll\" is off-the-hook YUMMY!!!  (see picture)  I love fancy sushi rolls and this one hits the mark every time.  It's a Shrimp Tempura roll topped with Tobiko, Spice Tuna and sliced Avocado.  The Shrimp is plump, tender, and fried perfectly, the spicy tuna is fresh and seasoned nicely, and the freshness from the creamy thin sliced avocado balances the roll off perfectly!  The roll comes beautifully presented on a platter drizzled with a creamy spicy sauce and a sweet soy sauce.  Delicious!!  My new favorite Sushi roll in Charlotte.  My son and my Mom always get the Sesame Chicken.  It's really good...if you like Sesame Chicken.  The chicken is crispy and the sauce is thick and tasty.  For the lunch special, it also comes with a delicious eggroll and fried rice (they have very good fried rice...not crunchy or greasy and not overdone with peas and carrots).    We also really like their Crab Rangoons.  Crispy and not oily with the right amount of filling.  My husband typically goes for the Ho Fun, but he's been on a major Thai kick lately and has ordered the Chicken Pad Thai during his last two visits.  He likes it to satisfy his Thai craving when we can't make it over to Thai Taste (the BEST Thai food in Charlotte, in our opinion), but he had to order it with extra spice the second time around because it wasn't spice enough the first time.  He enjoyed it...as a substitute, in a pinch.  :-)  Other items that we have tried and enjoyed are: Lo Mein, Chicken and String Beans, Garlic String Beans, Garlic Broccoli, Beef & Broccoli, and Wonton Soup.  I should also mention that I am very suprised by the number of negative comments regarding service.  We have only eaten in 5-6 times and it's almost always during lunch hours, but we have never had bad service there.    We really like Kami and we're happy with the new menu.  As long as they keep the current standards of quality and service, we will continue to be fans.   For anyone who like Shrimp Tempura rolls....you must try the Weddington Roll...it's a Shrimp Tempura roll on steroids!"}
{"text":"Really good chinese food. Love their sesame chicken. They also have great duck sauce. Their prices for dinner are a little high but so far it has been worth it."}
{"text":"Most of the items on their menu that I've had, have been very good tasting. Sushi is pretty dang good. We like the \"Weddington Roll\" in particular, and the Ichi Roll. General's Chicken, Kung Pao, Broccoli Chicken are all very good.   If I have a gripe, it's just their pricing-- comparatively speaking, it's pretty high. If you get take-out, plan on spending $10 per meal, not including egg roll, or anything else. If you're feeding 4 people, that becomes a pretty big ticket for Chinese food - but it is good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I agree with Mandy. Awesome food. The only downside is that there is somewhat of an uncomfortable atmosphere from the waiters and just the people who live around here..."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a regular but if I need chinese and don't want to drive, it's where we head. The food is pretty good and we've always had good service.  I would agree that the prices could be better but the portions are usually large enough for my wife and I to share a dish."}
{"text":"Unfortunately competition is lacking is Wesley Chapel, and quality has gotten worse. Had Pad Thai, and worst I've had (it was acceptable in the past). Tasteless overall, and seemed like everything in our order was horrible. Put some other Thai in the area please! At this point if I want decent Thai, closest is at least 15 minutes away, as well as Chinese. Stay away from this establishment until they fix the quality issues."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the ratings here aren't higher.  The food is really good.  Sushi is really good.  The spring rolls are fantastic.  Prices are reasonable.  and if you call for take out, you better get in the car as soon as you hang up the phone, they are fast."}
{"text":"I give it a single star because the staff was nice.   The other positive is that the green tea was hot and strong. However, the sesame chicken lunch special was the poorest I've ever eaten.  The brown sauce was very funky with a musky flavor.  It was NOT good.   Hate to give it a single star, but we're supposed to rate a restaurant by its food.  Terrible aftertaste."}
{"text":"I recently ordered some takeout. I was told on the phone that the food would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I showed up about 15-20 minutes after I ordered the food, and waited for ANOTHER 10-15 minutes before I got my food. The restaurant was almost empty. I tried the Super California sushi entree and got miso soup and Thai spring rolls with it. The Thai spring rolls were good. They were nice and crunchy and a decent size for the price. The miso soup had a LOT of seaweed in it... Like, way too much. I didn't know that miso soup was even supposed to have seaweed in it. The Super California sushi entree came with three variations of the California roll: normal, spicy, and crunchy. It honestly tasted like buffet sushi, but it wasn't inedible. The rice-to-sushi filling ratio was way off; the sushi rolls barely had any rice surrounding them. The crunchy California roll was easily the best of the three. It had the most flavor. Overall, not terrible, but I'll go somewhere else for sushi next time."}
{"text":"The dinosaur egg is a must-spicy tuna surround by thin avocado slices topped with panko and sauces. Work of art!  The bento boxes are the way to go-variety of selections 5 sections to fill-kinda like the old TV trays but a much nicer presentation.   Since they do A LOT of carry out they have neglected the interior of the restaurant. The booths need to be reupholstered, the walls painted, and the rug changed.   Casual dress, not expensive, serving staff is  nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Food is good. I've been a regular customer since 2007. Service can be hot or miss as they always rotate through wait staff. The Japanese dishes are what they are best at just as an fyi."}
{"text":"If you live in the area it's a place to come and get Asian inspired dishes. It's just okay, nothing special to me. There food always seem to have a greasy feel to it. Their bento box is an okay deal, you can try sushi, rice, an entree and side item. Dinner is a bit expensive, the service is just okay nothing dazzling. It's Wesley Chapel, so if your here, go ahead and stop by. But if you had a choice for something else........go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service and quality, especially for the price. We got the Pad Si-Ew with vegetables and Thai Cashew Nut with vegetables and tofu. Both dishes had fresh vegetables, which were cooked just right, and they gave good amount of tofu as well. Food had tremendous flavor and the right amount of spice. We didn't even have to use our hot oil, which we always do to make it spicy. We did order vegetable rolls and they were yummy as well. This may become our go-to place if it's consistent..."}
{"text":"Great food! The sushi is nearly the best sushi I have ever had. The prices are a little high but it's worth it for the great service and amazing food. The ambiance is very nice. It's a good place to take a date or have a birthday. Kami gets very crowded on Fridays and Saturdays so it's in your best interest to make a reservation earlier in the day to avoid a long wait. We have been regulars here for a number of years and they know my whole family by name and what we always get. It's a great restaurant. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi was terrible as was the rest of order. Cold rice , empty rangoons, complete waste of money we just threw in trash."}
{"text":"Nice selection of food including good variety of sushi. Everything was fresh and the presentation was nice. Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I stopped going here because the food was getting bad,  but some friends wanted to go so I thought perhaps it had gotten better.    I got the General T's chicken & had a few pieces.  I was totally disgusted with the food.  There was no flavor & bad pieces of chicken.  Usually General T's chicken has some things mixed in for flavor - the red peppers, broccoli or a few other things.  There was nothing on this at all.  I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Best sushi place around - mind you that there isn't much competition in the Waxhaw area, but they actually have a decent sushi bar.  It's not terribly priced, but sushi could be cheaper in my opinion.  Lucky for them I pay for it since it's cheaper than driving 40 minutes.    The Bento box is an awesome sampling meal at a great price!  Much better than the fast, take-out type Chinese places."}
{"text":"I love this place! And I drive a long way to get here most of the time. The food is great and very reasonably priced. The only downside is the somewhat uncomfortable atmosphere at times. Would recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"My go to sushi place! We will usually do a bento box plus a roll and the chicken lettuce wraps and it feeds two plenty!"}
