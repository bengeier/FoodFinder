{"text":"The ice cream was very nice and it's a lovely little place to sit and eat.  Wicked expensive for individual ice creams though but the tubs are reasonable."}
{"text":"The best ice cream in Ajax/Pickering. Lots of flavours. They have Kwartha Dairy flavours."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars for two reasons:  1 - The staff who work here are just downright miserable.  I get that the owner of the company wants to hire minimum wage workers to run the business while they enjoy life, but these two people have zero work ethic.  They seem to do the bare minimum.  2 - While their ice cream selection is nice, that's pretty much where it stops.  They only offer hard ice cream, milk shakes (which are $7!), and a small selection of beverages.  I'd rather go to Menchie's to be honest."}
{"text":"Such a great spot...they even have lactose free ice cream with gluten free cones...brilliant!!"}
{"text":"This place is way too pricey $3.25 for a kiddie scoop and it was tiny. I will never come back rather buy a tub of ice cream for that price or go somewhere else. I don't know how it's always so packed people are crazy paying that much for not a lot of quantity. Rip off"}
{"text":"Love walking here in the summer to get ice cream!"}
{"text":"Customer Satisfaction rating:    2 sticky Kiddie Fingers up.  (No, not those 2 fingers)  It's been awhile since I saw an Ice Cream Parlour where Children outnumber Adults 3-to-1. That makes it a great neighbourhood sweet spot for Family & Friends of all ages.  Smoothies, Frozen Yogurt(10%, Maypole(20%) Sundaes, Kawartha(60%), Nestle(10%)"}
{"text":"Always good ice cream.  Love the Kawartha Dairy.  Busy on a hot summer night."}
{"text":"Who does't like ice cream? ;)  They feature Kawartha Dairy Ice Cream, which is wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the ice cream selection is large and they even have sherbet...lots to choose from. However, today the two young men working behind the counter looked miserable. No greeting, no smiling and would only speak if absolutely necessary.   I've cream is supposed to be fun! Lighten up guys."}
{"text":"Nice little spot that offer a variety of different ice-cream flavours. Had the Death by Chocolate and French Vanilla with reese peanut butter cups and chocolate chunks. Love the mini Reese cups in the ice-cream."}
{"text":"ice cream is great but man did they increase the prices  kawartha is so good! they should have more of a variety of flavours though"}
{"text":"In the heart of Pickering Village, I really like this place for its location and the numerous flavours of Kawartha Ice Cream.  Situated in the Pickering Village, this place makes your feel like your in Europe. After you get your delicious Ice cream head out to the courtyard and sit at one of the many tables.  Ice cream you can get anywhere, but if u want that Euro feel while eating it, this is the place."}
{"text":"Village Ice Cream Shoppe is a cute little ice cream place.   Great selections of Kawartha and Maypole ice creams. They also serves frozen yogurt too...  Good if you are in the neighbourhood... \"A day in Pickering/Ajax\" and you have kids or adults that are young at heart! Great place to drop by for some ice cream and washroom break!  The location of Village Ice Cream is inside one of the Chalet/Castle setting, good photo opportunities!"}
