{"text":"My family went for lunch today. First, the waitress, Emily, was awesome. The best service I've received in a long time. The food was fantastic and brought quickly. I had the grilled chicken with mash potatoes and bake beans. The serving size was very large for the money. Two big chicken breasts. The cheese muffins were awesome. We tried several desserts as a family and they were all delicious. When you go ask to be seated in Emily's section she won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I ordered my first carry out GF meal from Jim 'N' Nick's today. The cashier was new to food allergies, and didn't know many answers to my questions. However, she was eager to learn, asked the chefs, and the manager to be sure she answered all of my GF questions. She found the food allergy listing and walked me through the items available. She went above and beyond to learn about and respect my allergy. There are many GF options available in the meats. Many sides as well. I will eat there again!"}
{"text":"Usually really good but tonight we ordered Togo and it was terrible. Seemed like the brisket and hot links were leftovers that had been sitting on the grill for awhile. Called in our order and told us it would be 10-15 min, came and waited another 15 min. Not only did it take longer but the food was underpar. My previous review raved about this place and we were regulars but there are too many other bbq places for such poor food quality."}
{"text":"Im updating this review as Jim n Nicks can be somewhat inconsistent. We don't eat there nearly as often anymore, but when we do we enjoy the brisket, which is sometimes awesome and sometimes just ok."}
{"text":"Good food. Large portions. Almost did the double meat plate but glad I held off, was stuffed before finishing everything."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food! Great service, and a great atmosphere. The banana pudding is to die for. Don't let the parking lot fool you, there is lots of space for seating, it probably isn't as packed as it looks!"}
{"text":"I was craving ribs...and I still am.  Disappointing to say the least.  Went at dinner time and the restaurant was busy, but we got a table for 2 right away.  I ordered a beer, which came tepid with a non frosty glass.  I asked for a cold one and the waitress returned with a beer already in a glass...think they poured it across to a frosty glass?  It was a little colder?  Ordered a half rack of baby back ribs with fries and green beans.  The food came fast, a little too fast in my book for ribs.  The ribs were tough.  I was expecting fall off the bone tenderness.  I sawed the meat off the bones with my steak knife.  The ends of the meat were scorched and too crunchy to eat (some of that was in my husband's pulled pork sandwich too, which had to be removed while eating because they were too hard to eat)  The handcut fries were greasy and just ok.  The best part was the southern green beans; soggy, salty, and cooked with ham.    Wasn't worth the trip."}
{"text":"good bbq and fresh homemade cheese biscuits. a little pricey compared to most restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"OMG..we loved it all!  We had slow cooked collards, mac n cheese, fried green tomatoes, chicken, turkey, links, ribs, smoked wings, and pulled pork.  It was all the best we've had in a long while at a restaurant.  We are already making plans to stop back by when we ride back through NC next month.  Kudos to our waitress Drew she was amazing with the best customer service skills!"}
{"text":"They have good brisket and their cheese biscuits are yummy.  We've had their two meat combo dishes and their salads and have not been disappointed.  We have gone through the drive-thru each time and are glad they have it.  There are many bar-b-que places to eat here and I would have no problem in recommending this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! Love their spicy habanero bbq sauce.   Very good smoky tender but not dry meats."}
{"text":"The star of our night was bartender Meredith. She's energetic, engaging, welcoming, service-oriented, good natured, and makes a hell of a drink. If I return, it'll be because of Meredith."}
{"text":"Wife had the onion rings & pulled pork she said it was very good 10/10  Also I had the fries & grilled chicken 7.8/10 fries weren't great but the grilled chicken was good"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area. Servers are very friendly even during busy hours. Tasty food and the cheddar biscuits are to die for"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice, and were not disappointed. Service was fantastic, and we even got a bloody Mary on our second visit. Which, by the way, was one of the best ones we have ever had.  Today, we tried take-out. I arrived at the height of the lunch rush and was greeted with smiles all the way around. I was politely pointed in the direction of the take out order section, where, I waited no longer than 30 seconds to one minute before a young lady popped up to answer my questions and take my order.  After getting home with all my goodies, (preparing for my husband to come home for lunch), I realized I didn't have all the sides that I ordered. Because I really wanted to try the beans today, I called the restaurant to say that I would be back by to pick them up later. The manager was more than accommodating, and  went above and beyond what was necessary to make sure I was happy before leaving."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it has always been a good experience. I've read reviews of bad service but never seen it myself. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Real smoke with real smoke flavor. I've had ribs on Beale and these although the ribs here aren't Beale level, they are close. Little on the salty side for me but good. We've had the pulled pork as well it is has been good and the muffins are great too. Don't know what the complaints are about in some of the reviews but I imagine everyone has a bad day. I'd go here before Sonny's across the street!"}
{"text":"The cheese muffins were great. The pork bbq was good and the portion was very large. The sauce itself was just about average. The collards and apple sides were excellent but the creamed spinach was a huge disappointment - it was indistinguishable from the spinach-artichoke appetizer minus the cheese! The restaurant was busy so the service was slow but overall the atmosphere was pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! I go often for my daughters through the drive thru. Sometimes, it can take awhile when they're busy! But, the food is great, and so are the prices!!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't so great. Prom sandwich didn't have that much pork or flavor in it, maybe it was an odd day for them?  Definitely try the lemonade, it is oh so good!"}
{"text":"A tale of two issues. Good food, surprising (in a bad way) service Went there tonight with my 12 year old son. I ordered the ribeye, he ordered the ribs. I could tell from the first bite, he didn't really like his; there were lots of little pieces of bone (which will happen sometimes), but also he didn't really like the taste.  I tried to encourage him to tell the waitress, but he doesn't like \"making a fuss\". About 2/3 of the way through the meal, the waitress came to see how everything was, and i told her \"my ribeye is great, but he really doesn't care for the ribs actually\" (and gestured to his plate which was barely touched). She looked, and looked at him, and said \"oh, that's too bad\" and left.  Note: other than this, she was great; very attentive, refilled drinks, etc.  But this is the moment where the staff can either get customers coming back or.... not coming back. And she clearly decided she didn't care.  I quickly finished my ribeye (which was really very good), and she brought the check, we paid, left, and that's that. Probably won't be back. She had every opportunity to suggest bringing him a different entree, or even just crediting back the price of his entree (I was more interested in him enjoying his meal since he picked the place; than in getting my money back) - but she didn't give it a second thought.  I would guess the General Manager would have liked to know since most good restaurant managers know this is the moment where you retain or lose customers, but i really wasn't in the mood to be the one to proactively ask for the manager and spend more time there. We were ready to leave.  So - good food for the most part (appetizer biscuits are good too), but unfortunately they probably lost a customer because a waitress wasn't in the mood to solve a problem."}
{"text":"Went for dinner during a week night and there was plenty of outdoor space to enjoy a nice dinner on the patio. Server was great, good was good, definitely exceeded my expectations. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Was there with my family from out of town last weekend.   Great food.  Biskets are the best!!  Great BBQ and sausage was the best.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Insanely crowded but with lots of waiters/waitresses standing around.  Ordered to go and it took 10 min to get someone to take my order.  Luckily the lady they finally got was awesome as it was my 1st experience. Good was amazing but is it worth the chaos???"}
{"text":"I easily would have given my first visit here (through the drive-thru) an easy 5 stars as the food (6 piece chicken strips w/ Habanero BBQ Sauce on the side) was PHENOMENAL!...however, I had to wait close to 10 minutes to get it.  Now, I must say it was piping-hot, fresh, and damn delicious when it finally came out, but service needs to be in-place to make the experience worth 5 stars.  After ordering, paying, and proceeding to drive up to the second window...I waited 1 minute to have an unfortunately dirty-looking guy tell me (nicely) that it will be a couple minutes before the food comes out.  Okay, no problem, right?  Well, that was the last I saw of him until he handed me the food 8 minutes later with no apology, or any further explanation as to why it took that long when they are clearly trying to offer drive-thru service as a means of getting their incredible food.  Perhaps a sign is needed (Drive-thru) telling potential customers that food may take awhile!  We don't know what's going on in there!  Of course we want fresh and hot food, but don't leave us guessing that our food might be being neglected for whatever reason!  At least put a sign up if the food usually takes 10 minutes through drive-thru!  That was some fine-tasting chicken strips, however!  Huge!  And that habanero BBQ sauce (which I didn't see listed on the menu) is incredible if you like spiciness!  I will go back!"}
{"text":"So fresh! Fantastic customer service as well. I love that they have a drive thru too!! So lucky to live so close to this place."}
{"text":"Food is good.  i got the smoked turkey, mac & cheese (I have had  better) and mashed potatoes.  The gravy was extremely salty.  My friend got the coleslaw and it was really good, will try that next time.  The cheese biscuits are great. Also got the pecan pie with whipped cream. Delicious.  It is local so it is a nice place to sit outside and wind down on the weekend."}
{"text":"Food can't be beat.  Parking is an issue.  Try the ribs or the brisket.  True BBQ."}
{"text":"My family and I had a terrible experience here. First, our waitress kept forgetting to either ask or bring items to our table. My mother in law was never asked if she wanted a drink, my father in law didn't receive his soup until food started coming out and our food took forever to come out. I ordered the fried chicken tacos. They came out cold and tasting of cigarettes. A manager kept looking over and I got his attention. He thought he smelled cigarette smoke and that's why he kept looking at me. Literally, the chicken tasted and smelled of cigarettes.   My mother requested to not have onions and mustard on her burger and guests what? The burger came out with everything she didn't want. When my mother brought this to the attention of Jamie our waitress, she was ignored. She had to get the attention of the manager and he took it back and got her a new one. My mother in law requested no pecans in our salad and no surprise here...got pecans in her salad. Another waitress overheard and was willing to take it back. Our waitress stood there and did nothing.   When the cook arrived with my replacement food, he gave a backhanded apology stating the taste wasn't for everyone. I know what smoked food tastes like. No one likes the taste of cigarettes in their food. I requested a medium well burger and received something that was burned on the sides and barely cooked in the middle. The burger just fell apart as I ate it. Same thing happened with my mother's replacement food.  When the check came out, the tacos were still on the ticket! They were trying to charge us for food I didn't eat. The waitress gave a half apology and got it removed. My family and I will never come back here. I suggest everyone else do the same."}
{"text":"Food was good .Tried the deviled eggs ,hot links and the BBQ salad .Food was good .Service was ok nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for an early dinner on the way up to Raleigh based on the yelp review. A little bit disappointed... Ordered baby back ribs and the southern burger. The burger was good, but not a burger that I'd miss... For the ribs, I'd say it tasted more like spare ribs than smoked baby back ribs, not tender or juicy as I expected for their price, meh. The trimmers we ordered, Mac and cheese and collards, were so much better than the main dishes."}
{"text":"This place is soooo awesome for BBQ. This is it. It's at the top of most locals' lists for good bbq and definitely our fav. We would eat here all the time if we could afford it! The biscuits are to die for!!! Oh and the parking lot is always crowded!"}
{"text":"AMAZING BBQ FOOD!!!  My sever was awesome! I'm from NYC so I definitely received the southern hospitality!! Real real BBQ food!!! Bread to die for..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Food, service, value all rate well.  I was there for lunch.  Seated quickly and didn't have to wait long to order beverages.  Tried the pimento cheese and hot link app.  Interesting.  It came with sliced Serrano peppers and saltines; presentation unimpressive.  Taste? Wow.  The balance of the slice of the rich link sausage and the blandness of the saltine with a smear of pimento cheese needed the oomph of the pepper.  I had the mac and cheese with the Tuesday taco special.  Portion was generous, pasta not overcooked and plenty cheesy. It was served hot enough to blow while you're eating.  Important because it was difficult to stop eating.  I was getting pretty full before I tried my tacos because of our app and those cheddar, corn, muffin?/biscuits.  They were inhaled pretty quickly.  It's my fault my fish taco got a little soggy.  I had to finish the mac and cheese.  Had to.  It was still crispy but the bottom had gotten a little soggy from the slaw after sitting a minute. The fish was well seasoned and crispy.  The other taco: brisket was less impressive. It tasted slightly smokey but the texture was unexpectedly strange.  On the mushy side.  Service overall was attentive.  Atmosphere and energy level very good.  A good place to get quality food and good service."}
{"text":"Jim N Nick's is the only place in the Charlotte area that I can find a barbecue stuffed potato, a long-time favorite from when I lived in TX. The potatoes they use are gargantuan, so it always means I have leftovers for another meal, never a bad thing. I've never seen a bigger potato, to be honest. The cheese biscuits are awesome - if by some miracle I didn't need a box for leftovers I'm pretty sure I'd stow any leftover biscuits in my purse."}
{"text":"I just spent 30 min in the drive thru and there were only 3 cars in front of me. This is not an exaggeration. 30 min. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"Love the cheddar muffins prior to the meal.  Had the hot smokey wings as an app, very tasty but not much meat.  Also, a little spicier than I was expecting.  For dinner I had the half rack of baby back ribs, with macncheese and baked beans.  Both sides were incredibly delicious and the ribs were more than I could handle.  Really good food!  Service was a bit slow with drink refills."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been to two different locations and it's my favorite BBQ in CLT! Great options for Gluten Free!!"}
{"text":"Chopped Beef Brisket!!   And the Cheese Biscuits might be the best I've had, period !!   The Barbeque plates are great as well.  I've always had great experiences at this location. When I have friends in from out of town who want a Southern style meal I take them to Jim N Nicks and they are always left with a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Wowsie Wow. Heard good things about this place but was skeptical when I saw they had a drive thru. Immediately upon walking into this place you know it's the real deal. Atmosphere was nice, it was busy but not loud, good lighting, bar area, good music playing in the background, casual but not run down or pretentious, excellent drink selections, basically all around good.   Obviously their smoked meats are their signature. Must try's are the brisket, Mac and cheese and the banana pudding.   Would definitely go back if I am in the area.."}
{"text":"First time eating at Jim and Nick's.  Ordered a combo platter with 'pulled' chicken and brisket & side of collards and onion rings.  The Onion Rings were the best item on the plate.  Pulled chicken was like boiled chicken breast (unseasoned) with sauce on it. Would not recommend this tasteless dish.  Brisket was tender but Very salty.  How could you possibly ruin a dish of collards? --- There were more stems in the small dish than anything else. Husband ordered a pulled pork plate with potato salad and baked beans.  Pork was fine.  Sauce was already on the pork.......Would prefer a selection of sauces rather than already on the pork and one other sweet sauce that was on the table.  Potato Salad and baked beans were good.  The small cheese rolls were tasty but would like to have had hush puppies offered.    Our Waitress, Melanie was very good.    We would not recommend this restaurant and we would not return."}
{"text":"Corn muffins were amazing and good service but nothing noteworthy here. I have traveled extensively throughout the south and always try to seek out new BBQ. Pork and ribs were good but not special. Sauces were unique but not something I wanted the recipe for. Sides were disappointing, green beans, mashed potatoes and barbecue beans in particular. Everything was over salted."}
{"text":"Very plain food with good service and perfect country sweet tea. Got a sampler place and was not impressed. Felt on par with Shane's Rib Shack but lacking the flavor. Heard and read great things but still below average."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday.... date night wasted. Mary our bartender didn't pay us any mind and we were sitting at the bar. Catfish was very bad"}
{"text":"This restaurant is normally good if you eat in, but do NOT get to go. They fill the family meal containers 1/3 the way and don't give any sauce! What is barbecue without sauce! Just meat. This restaurant needs to change there slogan, because they definitely don't give you their best."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch there today and I had the beef brisket and my wife had the baby back ribs. We were very disappointed in both dishes because the ribs were very dry, tough, and no flavor. Both of us love baby back ribs and these were the worse we have had. The Brisket was the same way dry and no flavor. Our server did not give us any napkins and we had to ask for tableware and napkins. We will not eat here again due to poor tough meats and high priced for what we ordered."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and loved it both times.  Service is excellent.  The complimentary corn muffins are addictive. Ribs are good.  Not great (a bit dry) but good.  Sides are outstanding and the pies?  Lord have mercy!!!  They also have plenty of craft brews on tap.  Plus, the music is second to none: blues, new grass (heard two Avett Brothers tunes), and alt. country a-plenty.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!! The catfish was excellent! Atmosphere casual and great for quick meal! The muffins that are served before the meal can be very addictive!"}
{"text":"Waste of money. Bad food bad service.  Owner Troy is a complete asshole.  Do not eat here.  You will regret it."}
{"text":"Yum!! We just ate here for the first time for a family dinner and wow! The service (Thomas) was exceptional, he was ready with suggestions and very polite and prompt. Everything we had was stellar, the corn muffins maybe my favorite. We tried tacos, mac n cheese, hot pork links, and pulled pork and we're not disappointed with a single thing! We will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"They changed their portion size from 8 wings to your choice of either 5 or 25 wings per order.  It does create an excuse to order a lot more and share, since 5 wings are not quite enough for a meal."}
{"text":"If you have a taste 4 barbecue this is the place to go to. I absolutely loved it!! Those cheese cornbread muffins and Mac n cheese are to die for! Everything was great from the service that my family and I received to the taste of food. I would recommend anyone to try it out."}
{"text":"Love this place.  A wonderful lunch spot for me.  Those biscuits are always a treat.  I save up my carb count just so I can eat two of them.  You won't be disappointed.    Some of my faves are the loaded mac and cheese and the Southern salad with smoked chicken.  The brisket is also good and less fatty than most places.   The service is always great as well."}
{"text":"The four of us were disappointed on our first and probably last visit. Outside of the absolutely delicious cheese biscuits and friendly server (although not highly attentive), not much to like in this restaurant. The ribs were just about inedible as they were extremely tough. Lack of a mustard based sauce was a real weakness for me as well. Being a SC transplant and their being in SC, this really surprised me. We did not bother to send the orders back due to the lack of server access, very loud environment and over crowded venue. With so many bbq establishments within a ten minute ride, I don't  see how these guys survive unless they step up their game. If they do improve, please let us know. Otherwise, we will not revisit."}
{"text":"Convenient location close to great Wolfe lodge so we stopped here for some authentic nc bbq and weren't impressed. The food was dry and uninspiring. The only redeeming quality were the cheesy biscuits which were quite good."}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had!!!! Granted, I'm from the North and have only been to a handful of places that have bbq but this place is amazing!!!!!!! I always get the pig on a bun with Mac and cheese and potato salad! The service is crazy fast and the waitresses and waiters are always friendly! I love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible...been sitting for 10 minutes..ask 2 servers very ni ely for help.and they stated.someone would be w me...watching manager and 3 servers lean against bar chatting  Disapointing"}
{"text":"Jim and nicks is a good time, the BBQ nachos are great. I like the pulled pork and beef brisket combo sandwich. The pulled pork is perfectly done."}
{"text":"This place is just plain great! From the pulled pork to the smoked turkey sandwich to the prime rib, It's all good. My recent stop here, I was tempted with the Fri-Sat prime rib special and it turned out to be one of the best I've had! And the staff is always going the extra mile to make the meal superb. Eat here! Or take it out!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The biscuits were amazing! Macaroni and cheese is a must! Go hungry!!"}
{"text":"always good barbecue..when in doubt this is where I go in Charlotte. Comfort food. get the beef brisket, its awesome!"}
{"text":"Quick dinner at to the restaurant and found the food was overpriced with not much flavor. Staff did not help open the door and watch me struggle exiting in my wheelchair. The staff didn't seem very happy or friendly aside from our waitress. Should have known when we pulled in there was plenty of parking and couldn't get into any of the near by restaurants. We are not likely to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came to Jim'N Nick's after reading other reviews. This place was SLOW and the food was mediocre at best. The food took forever and it was not even hot when it got to us. I would not come here again. Should have gone to Texas Roadhouse which is next door."}
{"text":"Our dinner experience was mixed. The food and drink selections are pretty good (but not great), but the service was quite unprofessional and needs to be immediately addressed by management. The first waitress to approach our table (after an initial wait of five minutes or more) started with an excuse that she was overwhelmed and would get to us soon. Then she proceeded to voice the same excuse to all tables around us every time she appeared. So we placed a drink order with her.  Five minutes later, a second waiter appears to tell us he is our new server and will take our drink order.  Then, the original waitress comes back to state that our drink order was not placed after all, with another lame excuse as to why, so our drink order was placed by the second waiter.  Then, ten minutes later, a THIRD waiter approaches and states that he is our new server and to please disregard the poor performance of the other servers. Finally, after more than 20 minutes of waiting and three servers, we had a completed drink order.  The rest of the meal was less eventful, except for the fact that the original waitress approached our table again to \"apologize\" and provide another lame excuse. Really, she should have been fired earlier in the evening for complete incompetence, if this place had sufficient management."}
{"text":"I can't decide whether I hate or love Jim N Nicks for their cheddar biscuits. I love because they are sinfully delicious, I am a bit miffed because they are TOO good and I eat too many. But, is that really a complaint? I think not.  Highlights: - Peach sangria  - two thumbs up. I split a pitcher with my husband and we were smitten.  - Spare ribs-  best Carolina ribs I've had so far.... I'm still an ultimate fan of St.Louis and Arkansas BBQ, but they were still very moist and fall-off-the-bone tender  - Smoked catfish - I am not the biggest (cooked) fish fan, but this hickory smoked catfish was divine. So much flavor!! A crust, but yet tender and flakey on the inside!!! How do they do it?!   - Smoked wings - my brother in law ordered these, and he is the ultimate wing fan. He said they were an 8 or 9 out of 10, and he knows his stuff!!!!  Don't expect any lean sides, even with the vegetable of the day. When we went and I ordered it (boiled cabbage) it was laden with delicious bacon or pork of some sort. The collards are some of the best I've had, but I wouldn't order them if I was on a diet. But who eats BBQ on a diet??  Bottom line: The best BBQ I've had in this part of the city. You'll face a wait, even on a weeknight, but take out and a drive thru are available as well. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. I suggest any of there pork plates. It is $$$$ but you get plenty off food.  The sides are gray  the mac and cheese. The cheese Biscuits put the ones I've had at ruby Tuesday and red lobster to shame."}
{"text":"This new location opened near our house and we were excited to try it. The first time I ordered a chopped chicken salad. I read the ingredients several times and made sure it said it did not have onions. All the other salads listed said they had onions, which I can not eat, but this salad did not. My husband gets home with our food and the entire salad is filled with hundreds of slimy red onions. I threw the whole thing in the trash. I decided to give them one more chance and order the piggy potato. The menu says it has \"smoked meats\" so I expected several different smoked meats with cheese and bacon. What I ended up with was slivers of pink raw chicken that looked and felt like slimy worms. The baked potato was old as well. The drink (coke) did not taste right, it tasted like chemicals. I threw the whole thing away. Why does the menu says smoked meats and you get one meat and why are you not using cooked white meat on your potatoes? Why does your menu not reflect what you are serving? We will never be back."}
{"text":"I live in Birmingham, so I wanted to see how the one in Charlotte compared.  It's every bit as good as the JNNs in Birmingham.  I had the spare ribs and pulled pork with fries (homemade) and collard greens (ditto), and everything was delicious.  My daughter had the chicken fingers, which (also fresh and homemade) may be among the very best I've ever had anywhere and are great for those that may not be in the mood for BBQ.  Service here was extremely friendly, so I had no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Okay, I am going to give you full disclosure: I LOVE JIM N NICKS!!!!!!  I'm a Bama girl, I have personally seen Miss Mable ( the maker of those DELICIOUS pies) Joe the Pitmaster and began eating at this restaurant at the original in Hoover, Al. I gauge every dining experience at a Jim N Nick's to those had at Hoover.  This location is like a trip home for me. They DO NOT LIE when they say that everything is made fresh.  I have never had a bad meal here, and we were some of the first in the door when the restaurant opened this year, too.  I have eaten at JNN's in and around Birmingham, Al. Bufford, Ga and the one in Steele Creek not long after they opened ( never really felt it matched up the three times I have been there to the Hoover location) and this location tasted just like Hoover the first day they opened. I was in hog heaven pun intended!!!!  So here is my run down. To start, oh the bliss that is well made sweet tea!  Next the food. First 1A- CHEESY BISCUITS.  They aren't  biscuits but when they are this good they can call them whatever they want!  First 1B- pulled pork is AWESOME.  Whether it is on a sandwich or a plate and their sauce is wonderful; not too sweet, not too tart, give me my pickle it's just right.  Sorry to disappoint some, but in Alabama we don't do hushpuppies or cornbread with our Q. We just don't.  Never saw it done until I moved to Charlotte.  We also don't eat slaw on our Q sandwichs either---gross!!!  Second- I have been to MANY places in Texas, listened to MANY a Texan in Pasadena at the BCS National Championship game rave about their brisket, but I never enjoyed  brisket until I ate some here at Jim-N-Nicks.  I am pretty picky, too.  It may sound a little harsh on your arteries, but the Double Decker Sandwich with pork and brisket is delish!  I don't do ribs because I think you get too little reward for too much effort and mess, but they look good here.  I also don't do salads at a Bar-B-Que restaurant- what's the point???- cause that isn't what I come there for, but the ranch dressing is REALLY good ( I eat it with the onion rings YUM!). I know, I need to broaden my entree horizons, but the foods I have mentioned always call me back whenever I sit down with the intention of eating something else.  Next, the sides. Mac the Cheese ( it is SO good you HAVE to call it more than just mac and cheese) is the next best thing to what my Mom, taught by my Grandmom to create from scratch, makes in the world!  And my Mom would agree with that statement as she loves to eat at JNN's in Hoover, too.  Onion rings are fresh made and are very good, even better with the ranch dressing for a light dip. French fries are also pretty good, too.  Monday's are fried green tomato veggie of the day( it makes Monday bearable for me)- oh, good heavens they are made just right with cornbread meal that will lightly crumble as you bite into them and you can easily still see the tomato underneath. Baked beans are just about like my Mom would make 'em- she gets them every time she eats there, too. Coleslaw is respectable ( again it has Mom's seal of approval) and potato salad is pretty dang good, too.  And now, to the best part: DESSERT!  Miss Mable sure does know how to make a good, thick, slightly sweet pie crust.  It is so tasty that I could eat the crust on its own easy, just like many I have experienced with lemon chess pies ( I'm thinking Harry and Jean's that was once in Rock Hill).  So regardless of what the Creative Loafing food critic said a few years ago about the crust, these taste NOTHIN like a commercial crust or rather if they are done right they shouldn't.   There are three words, maybe four,  I recommend and if you have read my profile you know what it is- Lemon   IceBox     Pie!!!     The Mister knows my love for him whenever I share this scrumptious, sweet treasure with him after enjoying a meal that makes a stomach smile.  If for some reason lemon isn't your thing- I really don't see how that could be buuuuuuuuut- they also serve chocolate, pecan, coconut and I think they also do banana cream but I don't go much further than Lemon IceBox  Pie, sorry.  Never have had a bad server, hostesses are always friendly and welcoming.  So now that I will certainly be seeing visions of lemon icebox pie dancing in my head tonight,  DEFINITELY stop in for some Alabama hospitality that will make your taste buds smile!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the pulled pork, cheese biscuits, mac & cheese and barbecue sauce. 2 stars for the baby back ribs (way too dry) and potato salad (mashed and \"off\" taste). 2 stars for customer service, understaffed for Mother's Day and not fully refunded for ribs I was unable to eat. Manager was condescending and needs to get over himself."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food was amazing (especially the Classic spare ribs). It's one of my family's favorite restaurants close by. Customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how delicious this food is. I got two days worth of food and I nibbled at tomorrow's food just to try it. Meat first! I got the beef brisket, pulled pork and spare ribs. The brisket MELTED in my mouth it was so tender. Sooooooo full of flavor, delicious charred outer edge OH MY GOD! The pulled pork had a little woody spice to it and the barbecue sauce was fantastic equally just as tender. I haven't eaten at all yet but I took a bite of my spare ribs and it was so tender very very very juicy.  The potato salad was thick and creamy, DELICIOUS and the perfect amount of seasoning. The cole slaw was peppery, vinegary and overall mind blowing. Mashed potatoes were velvet.... just pure edible velvet. And the baked beans were perfect. I don't even know how to put that into words. The only issue I have is the false advertising of the biscuits. They are not biscuits. They are cheese, sweet delicious heavenly muffin pillows. The wait staff were incredible tonight. The hostesses were the first faces I saw, they were cheerful and polite. They directed me to the bar to place my to go order. The next fave I saw was a gentleman who happily helped me with what I wanted to order even told me a little about the restaurant. The next was the bartender who was all smiles, served me yuengling  (best beer ever). The the last face was my cashier, who was swamped with taking to go phone calls but still managed to have a small chat with me. Everyone was calm and happy. Even the cooks in the back were all smiles. I cannot expressed how happy I am with this place. You got a new customer from Pittsburgh, PA. I will be telling my traveling friends and truckers and about this place. Thank you very much! P.S. I'd post pictures, but I've eaten most of it since typing out this post. I couldn't wait!"}
{"text":"Since Jim 'N Nick's opened a few years ago, I have eaten there about 4 times. The first 3 visits I enjoyed the food. I usually get the Hickory-grilled Chicken Sandwich. It was always filled with a generous portion of white-meat (as per the menu) on two slices of thick sourdough grilled bread.  The last time I went there, I ordered the chicken quesadilla and the usual chicken sandwich. What a complete 180 degree turnaround in quality! The quesadilla had all dark meat and was skimpy on the portion (not to mention it was tasteless) and the sandwich was horrible. It was a combination of white and dark meat that barely covered the bread. And talk about the bread, it was two slices of thinly-sliced sourdough toast. What little chicken was in the sandwich was falling out because the toast was falling apart.  I never experienced such a turnaround in food quality at a restaurant ever. Some people might say I just went on a bad night, but the complete 180 turn was enough for me to NEVER to go back."}
{"text":"DO NOT let the fact that this is a chain restaurant deter you from eating some great BBQ!   This place serves up some amazing BBQ that is just about on par as some of the other good BBQ joints in Charlotte. What separates this place for me is the massive portion sizes and the great prices! For the price you pay (which is relatively cheaper than other BBQ places), you can get a huge plate of ribs, a massive combo platter, or get a $5-$6 side.    Speaking of those sides, they are well executed, especially the onion rings. Not to mention the delicious cheese biscuits they give for free!  Service is fine and the overall layout of the restaurant is actually pretty nice.  All in all, massive portion sizes and great prices. Yes it's a chain, but who cares! Ribs and onion rings  and cheese biscuits from here all day."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat at Jim N Nicks and yum. If you aren't a fan of chains you should know that each location can source their ingredients as they see fit, that's pretty unique. I had brisket, butter tender. At the table we had fries, onion rings, beans, slaw and fried green tomatoes. All fresh and delicious, particularly loved the beans. This is crazy but the cheese biscuits - one was plenty for me - they are super sweet. Good stuff, looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The food came very quick but was lukewarm at best. The ribs were so tough we could barely eat them.  The brisket so so and the chopped pork was awful.    Others seem to love it so it might just be me"}
{"text":"the food was excellent and the service wonderful and efficient. A little noisy due to the open layout, but you could still have a conversation. Will come back."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Also used them for catering a couple parties and everything was good."}
{"text":"The food would have gotten 4-5 stars alone. This is a great little spot by the mall for food that is different than the run of the mill chains.  Our server was awful. I finished my one drink and she never came back to ask me for a refill. Also, while I had food on my plate and as I was chewing, she asked if I needed a to go box. While I noticed many open tables I am very sorry I was taking up space. Still eating and no drink refill my check was brought to the table.  I tried to make eye contact in hopes of maybe a glass of water at the least. She stood by the server's station just looking at me.  Food worth $30 for lunch? Absolutely. Being treated poorly, however, isn't worth another dime from my pocket."}
{"text":"It can be difficult to eat out with food allergies. One of our Parents Of Allergic Kids members recently ate here and had a wonderful experience. The food allergic community is grateful for those who take food allergies seriously. \"We had a good experience at Jim N Nicks Saturday night. We went to the one in Indian Land but they are also in Concord and Steel Creek. They have a whole allergy menu. And owned by a great local couple!\""}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this location on 6/23/12. The sides and onion rings were excellent. However the main course was a different story. The brisket and pulled pork were cold inside. The baby back ribs were tough and dry.   My wife mentioned this to the manager and our bill was taken care of with a promise of better food next time. It is a new location so perhaps the staff needs some time to work things out?   Overall, I was not impressed and feel there is better BBQ nearby for cheaper."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and those cheese biscuits are absolutely to die for! Yummy sweet tea. Ordered the brisket plate with potato salad and Mac n cheese.   Brisket was tender--nice sauce too. In terms of the actual meat, this was the best brisket I've ever had! Our server Jacola was pleasant and efficient. Great service! Food came out fast and hot.   I would recommend this place to anyone!! Great food and experience."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and time dining here.  The staff was extremely friendly.  Having not had Morgan Co White Sauce before, they were quite pleased to talk about it.     North Carolina is definitely home to some great creations and the white sauce is one.  It's great with a little smoked turkey or chicken.  It is a vinegar and perhaps mayo based  sauce with black pepper. It's kind of a spin off of the eastern vinegar red pepper style maybe.  I'll be making that at home sometime that's for sure.   Okay it's a chain and may not be the best BBQ of whatever style you prefer.  It does have a pretty darned good selection that is very good. The eastern Carolina bbq reminded me of my Grandmother's recipe.  No two are ever the same of course so you may have to sample to find your favorites.   The smoked turkey was moist, cut with a fork, and had a nice savory smoky flavor all on its own. So did the pulled pork.    All in all they have a great thing going."}
{"text":"Feels like they tried to mask the lackluster food with huge portions and super friendly service. I was with a party of 6 so we called ahead and were promptly seated upon arrival, which was nice because this is a happening spot. The bar was full and at 6pm on a Friday the wait was already getting lengthy. Both the hostess and server were as sweet as the tea, which made up for the bbq that I didn't find particularly impressive. Between all the people at my table we ordered a good portion of the menu, a thumbs up was given to the free cheesy corn muffins, bbq turkey and fried green tomatoes (which aren't actually on the menu). While it was a dollar upgrade the beef brisket left something to be desired as did the creamed spinach and fries. I probably won't be returning to this bbq joint as it has lots of competitors, but as I said it seemed to be a popular place for the locals so maybe the majority should rule."}
{"text":"Their Indian Land location's service has long way to go to meet their other locations. Just had a lady in the drive-through that was completely incompetent!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for barbecue! Pork is amazing, as are the little biscuits they bring out. You might wait for a bit on a weekend at this location but it's worth it- food and service are great. You can smell the meat smoking as you get out of your car and WOW. I I love that they don't have any freezers on their premises also."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place in Charlotte. Their meats are amazing and the service is great as well.   It's always busy there and a popular place to go for BBQ. My favorites are the cheese muffins."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ and the prices are not bad. Mostly pork, but that's pretty normal in the south... I would try the ribs, they are pretty tasty. Service is also good and not much of a wait."}
{"text":"Kristen thanks for the great service! Awesome food. Awesome employees. Awesome atmosphere;)"}
{"text":"I never thought I would heap praise on a BBQ chain, but here it goes!   Really great experience here.   The staff was very friendly. I ordered the pulled pork with Mac and cheese and potato salad. The meat was perfectly complimented by both the sweet and spicy sauces. Tender and prepared like it should be. The Mac and cheese had to be crafted from a family recipe (perhaps from the mother of either Jim or Nick) and made fresh right in house. The potato salad was, to my great surprise, flavorful and enjoyable - not the corporate dome of Walmart plastic that I've become so used to eating at BBQ chains across the country.   Not to mention, the place has a really great vibe with good tunes playing and a cool bar. Pallets of wood are stacked alongside the building and they have a pit in the back.   Overall, a really great place with great sweet tea too. A really authentic meal in the heart of chain city - do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Got the pulled pork , sweet tea and coconut cream pie.  Couldn't have asked for a better lunch!  I will definitely stop here again, next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love this place! Pig in the garden salad is fantastic and BBQ is up there with the best."}
{"text":"Great choice for a Monday night meal!  The smoked turkey, brisket, ribs and Mac and cheese were fabulous and fresh.  The collard greens were well seasoned and hot. The crushed ice in my tea was the cherry on top (it really does matter).  Our waitress was friendly,  helpful and super attentive.   I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Picked it at random and very happy we did. My husband is critical of BBQ and even he lived it. Great service, friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Their food is Amazing! I can't get enough of the place! Everything is good! I can't pick a favo thing! And their kids menu price are amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the catfish Samich, collards & baked beans w/sweet tea. Ask for lite ice & you'll get some tea with it, lol. Sat @ the bar and the bar tender was very friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"Took a good bit of time to be seated but it wasnt a problem. The food... the food was awesome! Great addition to Indian Land. Very nice and helpful staff the knew how to take care of there customers. Prices for the food match the high quality atmosphere and experience that come along with the food. Great place for family dinner."}
{"text":"Great experience! Great food! Would definitely go again. The ribs are fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best B-B-Q I've had in the Charlotte area. The cheesy biscuits are like crack and even the side salad rocks! What's not to love. I'm there on almost a weekly basis."}
{"text":"We live in Steele creek/Lake Wylie area so this is close and convenient. Food is good. Portions are good. No problem with service and never had to wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Wait staff was professional and fast.  Not a fan of chain restaurants, but this one is an exception."}
{"text":"Consistent good food, smaller inside than you would expect but have to give credit to their to go and drive thru. My wife and I have been ordering a lot of take out since we had my son and it's nice to have organized, easy options for dinner that isn't fast food.    Updating to reflect sanitation score: consistently around 90. That's just unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Not only is the food great, the people are fantastic!  I left my wallet on the bar when I left, they called every hotel in the area to try and find me, and finally called my home to tell my wife, who then called me.  They were closed when I got there, but someone waited for me and returned my wallet.  I will go there again tonight for dinner!"}
{"text":"Cheese biscuits are great. The bbq is average. We've eaten here 3 times and were never impressed. The food just doesnt taste fresh."}
{"text":"My first experience with Jim and Nicks was in Birmingham AL and became a fan.  The menu items are mostly good and the complimentary cheese biscuits/muffins are really good. Wished they offered more veggies as sides though."}
{"text":"Jim and Nick's is the best!! My macaroni  and cheese was so cheesy and the food came out fast! Very clean restaurant  and the bathrooms were clean as well! Service was great and the banana pudding is heaven!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Charlotte area and this place is my first review as a resident of this wonderful city.  My husband and I decided to patronize this neighborhood spot after searching yelp, of course.  We were promptly seated and had a wonderful and very attentive waitress who genuinely seemed to enjoy her job.  While my husband went to the restroom, I ordered our appetizers and some ice water and they were delivered to our table in a timely manner. We had the nachos topped with beef brisket and the hot, smoked buffalo wings with a side of bleu cheese dressing.  I was a bit leery because the nachos looked like there was hardly any brisket but I was pleased to find that it was just buried under a bunch of lettuce!  They were very delicious and I would order them again. I had to ask for additional jalapenos because there was just a few very small slices on it and next time I would ask for more than just a drizzle of the sour cream.  But like I said, they were delicious.  The wings were piping hot and after a few minutes of cooling they were perfect. Nicely seasoned with a hint of smoke.  Main course was the 2 meat combo and we got it with baby back ribs, sausage, collards and mac and cheese.  Mmmm,, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm finger licking good.  Hubby who isn't a mac and cheese fan really like their version of it and the greens, after adding a dash of tabasco, were quite good.  Ribs, devoured. Sausage with the side of pimento cheese was nice. I wish it was  a bit more spicy but give me a hot dog bun and I could do some great culinary things with it.  And the cheddar biscuits, how could I forget to mention them first.  They came out while we were waiting for our apps and they were the bomb dot com.  I'm so glad I didn't have any butter to add to this gluttony session.  We ended up with 12 of them! Yes, 12!!  And we just had to bring a few home to the kiddos to experience.  So light and fluffy!  The sauces on the table are really good on any of the meats.  They have a drive through if you don't feel like eating in. Yes, I said a drive thru!!  Incredible!  They have TV's to watch the game too.  So, really you have no reason not to give this place a try.  We left happy, full and looking forward to the next visit, and with tax, this great meal only cost us 39 bucks and change!  What a great welcome to Charlotte and my new hood!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service!  Seated Fast during peak dinner hour. Food and Service is way above average! The pulled pork is my favorite. Moist, tender n just plain yummy !!!!  Eat here and you will leave happy! Well run place. CUDOS Jim & Nicks!"}
{"text":"Jim 'N Nick's is a great chain BBQ place.  The atmosphere is nice and the people are friendly.  The BBQ meat and sides were satisfying accompaniments.  They have crushed ice.  What really made this place 4 stars in my book was the pie.  It is delicious.  You really can't beat a well made coconut cream pie or chocolate pie, and J'nN's really delivers.  Time for a nap!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here 3 times now and we really do like the BBQ pork. The service wasn't the best but it was good enough and the food keeps us coming back. I love there homemade chips and the baked beans for trimmings (sides). They also bring out these cedar muffins when you sit down that are amazing. My wife and I always order the chopped pork plate and we will continue to get that as we love it."}
{"text":"Started off kind of rocky with the long wait and cold mash potatoes, but the management and cook value great customer service so my meal plus dessert  was comped. Thank you"}
{"text":"It's fuddy-duddy taste and quality with a casual dining atmosphere. So far no Jim & Nicks restaurant has let me down; from Atl to CLT. I just hope they continue the consistent quality of food in all their stores. I'm come by right before closing for a rack of ribs and they were good! One of my favorites is the Pig in The Garden and I have a co-worker that crazy about the baked beans!...a woman at that!"}
{"text":"Overall... Decent but nothing memorable. (I did not realize this was a chain until later).  Small baby back ribs -- didn't fall off the bone, pretty dry as far as sauce and meat. That's a no when it comes to meat. Deviled eggs -- save yourself $3 and order it as a substitute as one of your sides if you get an entree combo meal. These are okay - they do taste like they've been sitting and not really freshly made. Mashed potatoes & gravy -- best part of the meal, and I think it has to do with the flavorful gravy; a bite of mashed potatoes were good, but plain. Chicken wings -- decent size, good flavor for sauce. Again.. nothing to write home about but was not inedible."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in after passing the place many times and everyone said I needed to give this place a try.  So we came in and gave it a try.  The food is good not quite what you think of when you here BBQ is North Carolina. Some of the foods are bland and need flavor.  Not sure I will come back but well worth a try."}
{"text":"First time, last time. Drive through order. It was painful to order, cashier had no knowledge of the menu and it took way to long. I ordered 1 #1 chopped pork sandwich combo and one chopped pork sandwich only. I received 2 pulled pork sandwiches and the fries upside down in the bag. The bbq was just average and had a natural gas taste. Great looking building but for $17.50 and bad service they'll struggle to make it. Better BBQ for half the price 10 minutes down the road,"}
{"text":"Assume place. Great first time experience. Wonderful service. Great selection of brews. I will be back."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to check this place out and it was pretty good. I order the baby back ribs which had a lot of flavor but I prefer \"falling off the bone\" type ribs then what they have, which is more of a smoke type rib. They were not horribly dry, but they do have 2 types of sauce you can and should add to when eating. Best part was probably the cheese biscuits they serve, they are phenomenal. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a family friendly place this is NOT IT. We have tried to eat there twice with our family of 7 which includes small children. Both times they refused to seat us as they cannot push tables together to accommodate. Sounds like they discriminate against large families."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The other less flattering reviews must be from when they were working their \"bugs\" out, because my husband & I tried it tonight, & we had a wonderful meal!  Starting with the cheesy corn muffins, to the delectable pulled pork, and super sides -- the mac 'n cheese is to die for -- we enjoyed our experience thoroughly.  Our server Thomas was very personable and helpful.  We will definitely come here again!!!"}
{"text":"The barbecue and all the food is phenomenal and the service is almost always excellent with an awesome atmosphere. My only complaint is that the price is definitely more on the expensive side."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and today was our second time here. First time we came here we were served little cheesy cornbread muffins oh my they were to die for soooo good and moist I was like keep them coming lol so for the main course I wanted a combo of pulled pork with baby back ribs well they were out of the baby back so I got the regular bbq ribs with coleslaw and baked beans and it was very delicious loved the pulled pork with the coleslaw couldn't get enough of it, so that was my first experience.  2nd time we went we I was all excited for the muffin things it's such high demand we got them by the time we got our appetizer damn lol so for our appetizer we had the nachos with pulled pork oh they were just devine I snapped some pictures this time around and since I just loved the pull pork I decided to do a combo with Brisket well this time they ran out due to a party of 52 sheesh how dare they  just kidding well I was able to have baby back ribs this time around so that's what I got again with coleslaw and beans. I was a little disappointed with the baby back ribs it was on the dry side and lacked some serious flavor so I'll just stick with the regular ribs! Service was ok but everyone so friendly I'll definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is good, I think a little pricey for bbq. I really enjoy their salads and the nachos are great. My kids always enjoys their meals."}
{"text":"I love the food, but the last three times we were here the service was pretty bad. We've been ignoring this fact because - brisket!!! - but I'm really, really hoping it improves."}
{"text":"They have great food, friendly staff, and we have used them to cater several events! Whenever we have guest in from out of town we often take them here. We have been going here for several years and never had any issues."}
{"text":"We usually love Jim & Nick's but today we had the worst experience with the waiter's lack of attentiveness and our disgusting, cold food.  The waiter seemed so out of touch. He took our drink orders and left for a good while, then proceeded to have a conversation with his coworkers after I said we were ready to order when he brought our drinks. When he finally came back he seemed so not in the mood to be there. We ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos as an appetizer and it was absolutely horrific. Not only were the nachos cold, but the pulled pork looked like canned cat food. We pushed it to the side and if he was attentive he would have noticed that we left the entire plate untouched. He didn't even bother to ask how was the food. Our ribs were cold & funny tasting and the mac and cheese had a glob of cheese clumped up in it and that was cold too. I learned over the years to never send your food back. We usually take our food home but today we left all of that garbage on the table. All we wanted was a good customer service experience and tasty food like we usually get. WE WILL BE TAKING A VERY LONG BREAK FROM JIM & NICK'S!!!"}
{"text":"I take customers here every year during our convention in the area. This is some of the best bbq I have had. The FREE cheese biscuits they offer on the table are to die for. We had 2 baskets of HOT biscuits and they were gone at the end of our meal! The bbq plate and sandwich were good. Fries and homemade chips are my favorites!  Service was exceptional. Looking forward to next year!"}
{"text":"SHORT AND SWEET We LOVE this place.  Fantastic bbq every time!!!! Great place to bring the family or enjoy a cold one with a meal to go.  Meredith is the best! You will find her mostly behind the bar,  with a smile and willing to answer any questions. Craft beer and wine to enjoy while you wait for your order or dine in.  Place is clean,  well managed, and staff is awesome and friendly.  I cannot say enough wondetful things about the food.  DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS! We love to take home their turkey and chicken to create several meals of our own. Don't forget the cheese biscuits too!!! You want great bbq, come get.  You will not be disappointed. My husband is a Southern boy and he agrees 1000%.  Much Mahalo!!!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review.  We went back there in June 2014.  Somehow the place had improved a lot.  The food was not nearly as salty as it was the last time we went.  It was actually very good.  Everyone in my family liked their chow a lot.  The parking lot at J&N's is ALWAYS packed, so that is always a good sign too."}
{"text":"Great barbecue! my family and I had the ribs and Carolina pulled pork. Sides of Mac and cheese, chips, collards and baked beans pulled the dinner together. service was great and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! I have been fortunate to be able to travel much of this great nation over the years and this has got to be at one of the best BBQ joints I have ever eaten at! The staff was gracious and awesome, especially Tim the manager who stopped by to talk with us.  I have the 3 meat combo meal. Carolina pulled pork, smoked hot links and brisket. For trimmings I had the special of the day fried green tomatoes and potato salad. Nothing disappointed at all. I took the two sauces, original and Habanero and mixed them together.  They have made in house desserts, I had the coconut cream pie and nearly died.... Tasted like my grandma made it If you are in the Charlotte/Concord area stop in this place!!!"}
{"text":"Overall very good.  The cheese muffins are excellent!  The beer list is not bad with something for everyone.  I was disappointed that they were out of brisket on a Friday night!  I didn't smell the smoker and they claim it smokes for 12 hours so I assume they either truck it in from another location or they will be out of it for the weekend.  I had the pulled pork.  Excellent flavor, but quite a bit of fat and gristle (sorry, I a pretty good smoker of pork and have spent time figuring out how to smoke and just have meat at the end).  Overall, very good and a great place for a beer and a snacks."}
{"text":"Very good food and environment. the staff was great in recommending a dish and they provided an excellent meal and experience. the brisket was a little dry but still had some decent flavor. the pulled pork was worth its weight in bacon !! took home a coconut cream pie which was gone as quick as the lid opened id love to franchise this in AZ I love Alabama style BBQ"}
{"text":"I just love the bbq, I haven't stayed and only gotten take out. the prices are a little high but that's just bc of my economics. I continue to go back there though. friendly, and near the main street, (south tryon)."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decent bbq.  Not my fav bbq place, but I'll probably bring my parents here."}
{"text":"First timers, the food was amazing, our server Amber was kind and attentive, my girlfriend and i loved the bread, the rib appetizers and the pulled pork main course was magnificent. We'll definitely be back soon to our new BBQ place"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with jim 'n nick's. Their cornbread cheddar muffin biscuits whatever they are called are amazing and match really well with anything you get off of the menu. I stick with the turkey plate and never leave without a side of the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Always great food and service. BBQ is amazing and best sides of any restaurant. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"This is my first review, although we have been there 3 times.  Each time, the service and food have been great!! 1'st visit - my husband and I shared a 2-meat platter of Carolina Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.   2'nd visit - I had Carolina Pulled pork, Mac & Cheese, and Collards 3'd visit - This time, I had a Greek salad with Smoked chicken, which was fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"OK, I usually try to steer clear of chain restaurants I cannot lie... This place was awesome. This was DAMN GOOD BBQ. The portions were good, not epic, but not skimpy either. The quality of the food was impressive. Delicious, smokey flavor, with thick sauce caramelized on the rib and fresh cut fies. I'm getting hungry again. My wife asked the server for her suggestion.  She confidently told my wife try the nachos and my wife loved them.    Oh yeah, the server..... Caitlyn was our server and she was great. She explained everything on the menu and answered all of our questions. She was quick to get our drinks to us and never let them get empty. When she learned that we were from Ohio and that this was our first visit, she explained how their BBQ could be different from what we're used to up north. She checked on us often and wanted to make sure that the food was to our liking.  Then the manager came over and said that the server informed him that we were from out of town. He wanted to make sure that we were having a good dining experience on our vacation.    The food was really beyond my expectation coming from a chain. But more surprising was the friendliness and sincerity coming from the staff of a chain restaurant. I have a feeling I'll be back before I head home to CLE."}
{"text":"Omg, first time here, the ribs were phonomimal, hot links and Carolina BBQ, but wait, what about those little cheese muffins....In love, saw a baked potato come out, that will have to wait till next time since we are so full.."}
{"text":"Love that they have a drive through and the food never lets me down. They only place I am able to find deviled eggs at. However, at 1.00 an egg half I eat them slowly ( hahaha)."}
{"text":"While the food is exceptional, it does not make up for the staff.  I visited with my wife and daughter, requesting a table/ booth in the bar area. The host was accepting of our request. As we were being seated, the bartender called put to the host, telling him not to seat us in his area. I looked around, there were no other tables/no other occupied in the bar area. There was one patron at the bar. The bartender was obviously not overwhelmed with patrons. Apparently just picky on who he wanted to serve, and we didn't make the grade. So, we decided to go elsewhere. Will never return!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! All cooked from scratch, all meats smoked in-house every day, cooked to perfection! Lots of great sides, but don't miss their Mac and cheese! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is a little overdue by a month or so.  Anyways, I'm not exactly sure what all the hype is about here.  I would say Jim N Nick's is pretty good had I not had other places to compare it to, but it is just in between 2-3 stars for me.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon with not many people there, so the service was great.  However, we had called to see if they would have a certain game on and we were told yes.  Once we got there and started to order, we asked for the channel to be changed to the game we wanted to see.  They did not get it...so much for that.  The food is just okay, we got a platter with classic barbeque and ribs.  Both were okay, nothing special.  We also got it with a side of mac and cheese and bbq chips.  I am a huge mac and cheese lover, but these just did not do it for me.  I loved the creamy consistency, but the choice of cheese and flavor of cheese was just not right.  The bbq chips were also nothing special, just like your standard bbq chips.  I will say I did like the complementary cheese biscuits.  I could see us coming back here once in a blue moon if we are craving bbq and want something close, but really, the best place to go in Charlotte is Midwood Smokehouse.  Not exactly convenient or close, but it is well worth the drive to that one over Jim N Nicks and others for good quality bbq."}
{"text":"Food is good but, the floors remind me of an old, old movie theater. I almost walked out of my shoes!"}
{"text":"This is a staple in our house. The staff is awesome, corn bread on point, and honestly if you have crushed ice in the drinks I'm a happy camper. We frequent Jim and Nicks for various reasons and I've had lots of things on the menu from their butter bean hummus, to the smoked turkey salad, to the pig patch, to the sourdough turkey sandwich and it's all been good. The bacon jam in the new appetizer specials wasn't really what I thought it was going to be, but hey anything with bacon can't be all bad."}
{"text":"I loved this place! We had a very nice and helpful server and she gave great suggestions! The food was also great and tasted of good quality! My boyfriend and I loved it! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great! The service is excellent! The food was brought out rather quickly! My wife and I ordered the three meat meal and it was the perfect portion size!! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, and comfortable atmosphere for family or business lunch make this place a winner. Not NC style barbeque, but I don't care."}
{"text":"By FAR, the best BBQ chicken I ever had.  It was served off the bone!  No sauce needed!  Only in town 2 days.. going there again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a two entree combo of classic pulled pork & turkey. The pork was pretty good,  but I really enjoyed the turkey most.   They're mini rolls/muffins were absolutely delicious.  Wait staff was very attentive and service was super quick.  I wouldn't say it's the best bbq I've ever had, but very good none the less"}
{"text":"Never like barbecue until I moved down south and this place is one of the best in town! Pulled pork sandwich is always a go-to! And the biscuits are phenomenal"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ.  We stopped in for an early Friday dinner around 5:00 and had no wait.  Our orders were taken promptly after being seated.  The service was friendly but not overbearing.  It was apparent they were expecting a big dinner crowd for the night as there were many staff members working the front and milling around as there were not many customers yet.  The restaurant seemed clean and there was tons of space so we did not feel packed in.  The kids menu was varied and it is easy to find something for every taste.  My daughter had the chicken tenders with potato salad and my son the drum sticks and mac&cheese. My wife went with the grilled chicken while I had the pulled pork on a stuffed baked potato.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The sauces were excellent.   The habenero sauce has a good kick but it is not over powering.  The normal sauce is also very good.  My potato was huge and only half was consumed tonight!  Both of the adult meals resulted in leftovers for tomorrow.  How can I forget about the biscuits.  Other reviews mentioned how good they are which is not an overstatement.  I really enjoyed dipping them in the habenero sauce for a great combo.  As they brought the baskets out, we quickly ate them.  They were so good.  We have been regulars at Midwood in Ballentyne and Queen City Q for about two years.  We have now found another good BBQ place to move into second place ahead of Queen City in our book.  A good meal and we are looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Great BBQ pulled pork sandwich, ribs and loaded baked potato with BBQ are my favorites. Restaurant always clean. See the same friendly servers. Great customer service. Food consistently good!"}
{"text":"Usually this is one of my favorite BBQ spots to eat. I can't rant ane rave all day about the potato salad and mac and cheese! This time unlike others tgey didn't provide me with any bbq sauce or cheddar biscuits. Like who eats bbq without bbq sauce. Other than that the foid was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Good beef brisket. BBQ sauce is a tomato based sauce, nothing special and kind of plain. They need more spices in their sauce. Their coleslaw was very good. From their advertising they are proud of their cheese biscuits. Eh, not much to them. The beef brisket was first rate. Bring your favorite sauce, try some cornbread, with their coleslaw and it would be 4 star."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. We came in from out of town and they were putting drinks on an empty table and ignored us. Then the manager put his hands on me. Very unprofessional. Will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"Restaurant was fairly clean.  Service was a bit slow.  The cheddar biscuits were great!  Regular pulled pork was very fatty/mushy and bland.  The brisket was decent.  Sausage - a little funky for me, not sure if it was the smoke or what.  Collards - bleh."}
{"text":"if you like bbq this place is great  try the brunswick stew and the cheese biscuits  go to tail gate place"}
{"text":"We have to be in the mood for BBQ. We were not disappointed. The portions were just right, not to much, but just the rite amount. We enjoyed the dinner and had 2 pieces of pie, one pecan and 1 coconut, the pecan was awesome but the coconut was just ok. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I'd heard very good things about Jim N Nicks, but left feeling let down.  BBQ is a personal preference, and the food was ok but not great.  For my money there are options in the area that I enjoy more."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. First time i had heard about it and will definitely be coming back. Brought some friends with me from up north and they couldn't get enough of the sweet tea and cheesey buns. The staff was excellent with my kids. I could see this place being tough to get into around race weekend for sure. Prices aren't too bad either. You definitely get what you pay for and then some."}
{"text":"I've never given a chain restaurant a five star review before, but the food here was truly exceptional.  Pulled pork sandwich, collards, baked beans, Mac and cheese, biscuits...everything was outstanding.  First time to Jim and Nicks...I'll be back."}
{"text":"Damn near as good as you can get, but with a few flaws that I couldn't overlook.   BBQ (meat) was EXCELLENT. Fall off the bone ribs and scrumptious pulled pork. One member of our group also had the fried chicken tenders which looked juicy on the inside and perfectly crisp (but not greasy) on the outside.   The sides were hit or miss: the loaded baked potato was humongous and that's not even the largest stuffed/loaded potato they serve! (As it's own meal you can get the loaded potato served with your choice of meat and it's enough for 3-4 meals.) The Mac and cheese was out of this world but the beans were just meh. They kind of reminded me of the flavor of macaroni salad (IMO: the gross kind with mayo, raw green peppers, and onion).   The fried green tomato appetizer (which isn't on the menu but apparently they always have them) was tasty but we were desperate for some sort of dipping sauce. They also came out kind of bare, just four on a plate - the cornmeal breading was kind of lackluster. I can only imagine though how tasty their cornmeal crusted catfish probably is, though!   Finally, they have a decent selection of craft, domestic, and imported brews and a full bar if you're in need of something harder.   Service was homey and cozy - just how you'd expect a BBQ place to be. Since our family now lives in this area, I imagine I'll have the chance to try more here in the future!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place. Just went back recently and food came out cold, we never saw our server -he had too many tables, not his fault- Just seems to be more \"fast food\" mentality then it used to be.."}
{"text":"The wife and I were in the area and always liked Jim 'N Nicks. We lived in Atlanta and they were always one of the restaurants in the dinner rotation. However, we moved to North Carolina and now Jim 'N Nicks is a have to be in area. I really wish they would open a location in Greensboro or Winston-Salem.   Service was oka"}
{"text":"A+ Awesome Always great service and food. Sit at the the bar every time Meredith is great! Smoked wings (ordered just drums no up charge) great taste and cooked perfectly. House salads great and the cup of chili fantastic...watch out for the Serrano pepper garnish hehehe Fresh squeezed juice for your drinks yum  1/4 chicken plate great sides ! Tons of food, great place! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Jim N' Nick's best barbecue in town. I want to thank the amazing team that came out to Harrisburg Elementary's Spring Showcase yesterday. My barbecue plate was super tasty, HOT and more than a generous portion! It's hard to get such a fabulous meal at an event like that and y'all knocked it Out of the park for me."}
{"text":"If you are in the Concord Mills area and have a desire for \"real\" BBQ then pull on in to Jim and Nicks. The stacks of firewood clue you in as soon as you hit the parking lot. Being raised in the south I am as picky about my BBQ as my NY raised wife is about her pizza, and this is pretty darn good BBQ. I have only tried the pulled pork and ribs, but both made me happy and filled me up. Their sauces are great, but not really needed, the meat offers enough smoked flavor on it's own. All of the sides i have tried have been up to par as well. The mini cheese muffins are to die for, I could easily eat unhealthy amounts of those. Bottom line.....very good BBQ,almost as good as mine.....almost :)"}
{"text":"Jim n Nick's is probably my favorite place for BBQ right now. The food is always hot and fresh and the flavor never misses a beat. This is a place where the entire family can sit and eat their hearts out without your pockets feeling the affects later. My child is a picky eater and she loves this place as well."}
{"text":"First time there today. New favorite spot in Concord. Service was excellent! Every bite of food was excellent! Had the Baby back ribs and pulled pork plate, potato salad, beans, mac&Cheese, and fires. All Excellent!"}
{"text":"Just went there once, but the food was great.  I had pulled pork on a baked potato, and it was tender and moist with lots of flavor.  Because I'm gluten and casein free, sometimes it's hard to find things to eat, but the waitress was super friendly and checked on ingredients happily for me from the kitchen staff.  Peach sangria was heavenly.  Definitely am going back.  Pretty good for a chain."}
{"text":"5 stars. Automatic 3 stars for real smoke. Another star for the cheese biscuits. Ridic. Another star for the variety of meats and the signature twist on the Carolina pulled pork.  The manager, Gene, has a great spirit, made me feel very welcome when I passed through on I-85 and ate my face off one night traveling up to NYC."}
{"text":"Beef brisket was tender and had a good smoke flavor, chopped Q was moist, Mac & cheese was a tad dry but cheesy. Pork ribs had the best smoke flavor of all and were full of meat! Loaded baked potato was good with great bacon, collards were yummy with bits of ham in them. Servers were attentive, never had to ask for a water refill, got our food just minutes after ordering. The only negative was the \"homemade\" banana pudding. I knew better than to order it because it's almost always a disappointment in a restaurant. It was topped with a packaged whipped cream and had a thick, gummy pudding and not a rich and creamy boiled custard, which is traditionally how we make it down South. I would recommend this place for everything but the banana pudding. If you want that, go to grandma's house or message me and I'll send you the recipe for the best Southern style banana pudding (topped with baked meringue) you've ever had!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, poor service.  I love the cheddar muffins they bring out, the waiter promised more and that never happened. It was hard to ask him about them too, because he was never able to be found.  I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and chz, it was delicious. The mac and chz is so good, so creamy, so bad for your health ha, but I definitely recommend it.  My boyfriend ordered a burger and it was the saddest looking burger ever. I get it, it's a bbq place, but for some reason he really wanted a burger.  His burger looked more like a sausage patty than anything else. I'm not sure if it's the norm, but don't get a burger there, go to Cookout or McDonald's.  Like I said, the waiter was never to be found, not attentive, so we were unable to ask him about the portion size of the burger. That also means you never get a refill on your drink.  He comes right at the end and he asks if we need anything, I ask for a box. He comes back with the check and asks if I need a box, I say yes, I asked for one earlier.   I don't feel it was too busy on a friday night, there was no reason the service was so poor because there were many employees working.  I'd recommend getting carryout if you want the food but don't waste your time with the service."}
{"text":"Amazing food, adequate and knowledgeable service. First time there; will be back. Best all-around BBQ in the area. Try the fried catfish-perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Went to Jim and Nicks for the first time  and thought it was a nice environment. I ordered shredded barbecue pork, baked beans, and potato salad. The barbecue pork meat was fine but they had only one type of barbecue sauce to put on it. It had a very vinegary taste with no sweetness. Then I tried the potato salad and it was heavy on the mustard. The baked beans dish was bland but heavy on vinegar. So basically, I had a very sharply flavored lunch. It was so disappointing I have decided that I will not go there again. When you eat, you should not be bombarded with only sour tasting or vinegary tasting food. My suggestion would be that they have a more creamy potato salad with less mustard. Some sweetness should be added to the baked beans,and that several options for barbecue sauce should be offered at the table. I prefer going to City Barbecue in Ballantyne. That is where the food is really delicious. We talked to the manager and he was very nice and comped our lunch."}
{"text":"It's always hit or miss on the ribs. Sometimes way too fatty, not enough meat, and other times, perfect. The pulled pork, Mac & Cheese, and potato salad are always good though."}
{"text":"First impressions: 8:00 Friday night and they're packed but no wait. We got the last table outside. Good chill atmosphere. Albert King. Bistro lights. Street is close but not too loud. Cornbread muffins certainly aren't amazing but they're pleasantly edible. Service is rather slow but they *are* packed and since we got the last table, I'll assume we're the last of a big rush.  Peach tea was wonderful and the chopped peaches in the bottom were actually fresh! Wish the straw was bigger or it came with a spoon - or a bubble-tea straw.  We were offered more bread and said yes.  We got the Queso, Smoked Tomatoes, Nachos appetizer. Fail. \"Smoked tomatoes\" = salsa with liquid smoke dumped in it. Some of the nachos were so stale they ripped instead of breaking.  Our food came and we asked for the bread again.  The beans were excellent. The \"Carolina BBQ\" was barely edible, it was drowned in liquid smoke. BTW, If you know your BBQ, you're offended by the fact they call it Carolina BBQ instead of east coast. (It's vinegar based. Or is it liquid smoke based...?)  She came to clear our appetizer plate and we asked for the bread again. (Oops, I forgot to ask for a refill.)  I liked the mashed potatoes but my wife said they lacked flavor - they're lumpy and fluffy with skins.   She came out and asked if we wanted more tea - our glasses were empty. We'd given up on the bread but she said she just remembered it and would bring it...  The bread finally came.  We finished up eating.  The refills came and we asked for our check. 15 minutes later: 13% tip. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite bbq place in the area! I usually have the classic pulled pork but I broke out of my normal menu choice and went with the 1 pound ribs. OMG....DELISH! Loved them! I always enjoy the cheese biscuits and I love the ice that they use in their beverages.  My favorite sides are the mac and cheese and baked beans.  It looks like a small place from the outside but looks are deceiving. The parking lot ALWAYS smells amazing with bbq scent in the air. Very decently priced food and outstanding service and quality."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! First off as soon as we came in we were seated quickly and with great southern hospitality. I'm not really big on biscuits and bread but the Cheese biscuits were WONDERFUL!!! The chicken strips were meaty and juicy my daughter loved them. The smoked turkey and chicken were smoked to perfection!!! And the spare ribs!!! OMG! The meat just fell off the bone it was so tender. I will def. Be back with a smile!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 845, closes at 1000. Nowhere near busy. Hostess obviously wasn't happy to be at work. Waited 7ish minutes to have drink order taken by Emily. Waited 5 minutes for the drinks. Finally got our cornbread rolls, the best part, about 15 minutes into our visit....cold. Began hearing the next table over saying they were waiting on refills and the A1 sauce, originally forgotten by the server, was empty. Finished our teas, waited some more for refills. Food arrived fast and hot, at least the kitchen was on point. Didn't wait long for the check. Thanks Emily. Your service as horrible. Kitchen did awesome...minus the cold cornbread, which I'll blame on the server not checking her food service. No bueno Emily."}
{"text":"Simply amazing BBQ. You can really taste the scratch made!"}
{"text":"So, I pretty much ended up here by accident and took it as fate.  Was around lunch time and I was getting a car looked at, at the Firestone place next door(don't go there).  Could smell the BBQ and decided to use my waiting time usefully.  I saw that place was packed, so I walked right up to the bar.  Was greeted kindly and quickly by the bartender.  Ordered a Terrapin Rye and began to scroll through the rather large menu for a BBQ joint.  First I saw Taco Tuesdays, which was just a tease, cause it wasn't Tuesday, but that sounded like the deal.  Then I saw it, what they wanted me to see.  The Double Decker.  From the bottom-Bun/pulledpork/bun/brisket/coleslaw/bun with a side of your choice.  Had to go with the onion rings too, for another 2 bucks.  $12.99 for a BBQ sandwich with O-rings at lunch, this better be good.  I sat, drank my beer, watched some tube, and read over the rest of my menu.  A catfish BLT?  Gotta try that sometime.  An array of reasonably priced burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Some time past, never saw my awesome bartender again.  Finally got me some cheese biscuits, pretty tasty.  Finally a lady walked up with my food.  It was a great concept and the BBQ was good, but the sauce wasn't quite there.  The backup sauce was labeled habanero, the heat was good but the flavor was barely above average.  O-rings were pretty spot on, but the batter didn't seem to stay on, and they gave the smallest portion of ketchup ever.  My beer was great, but I knew that when I ordered it.  All and all, pretty damn good BBQ(hence the 4 stars), but not worth the price.  And the service was mediocre at best.  If I'm ever down that way again, I'll stop back through.  Hopefully it will be on a Tuesday.  BTW:Uploading a pretty good lookin pic."}
{"text":"Lemonade & cheese biscuits I'm obsessed. If you want a receipt don't go to the drive thru...."}
{"text":"Best meal and service! Dana was awesome! I told her I had never been here, she brought out samples, explained everything and gave recommendations. So attentive. The food was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The service was horrible, the waitress seemed like she didn't want us there, the food was simply okay nothing special... the ribs were dry the mac n cheese has entirely too much cheese in it... this place has a lot of potential if they worked harder on their customer service and had more barbecue sauces besides the two on the table that tasted like ketchup and the other that tasted like firey hell! I will NOT recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of co-workers for lunch and was surprised at how upscale this Bar-B-Q place was. They have a large menu, and super friendly employees. It wasn't your typical cafeteria style Bar-B-Q restaurant and I appreciated that.   The water comes with Sonic style little chunks of ice, and you get cheese biscuits complementary. I thought they were a bit sweet, but my coworker loved them. For lunch I got the cuban with mac and cheese. At first bite I bit into a large piece of gristle which hurt and kind of off-putting.  Other than that it tasted great, as did the macaroni.   It's a good change from the rest of the chains in the Concord Mills mall area."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to a Jim n Nicks and my first to this location.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was great!  The rolls are worth the trip!  We had excellent service and were in and out pretty quickly.  Some of the items can get pricey for a spot like this, but I think the food is great and everything I've seen ordered looks great!  My husband loves the multiple meat platter and though I am pretty picky about bbq and brisket, Jim n Nicks delivers the goods.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Jim and Nick's for the first time after church yesterday.  It is apparently the happening spot for mid day meal on Sunday...but we still only had a 15 minute or so wait.  The cheddar biscuits they bring while you wait were very good - I recommend them! I had the grilled chicken club and fried green tomatoes...the sandwich was great, the tomatoes were okay.  Also at our table we had BBQ sandwich, kitchen sink nachos and a two meat platter with brisket and some kind of sausage.  Everyone seemed pleased with their meals (after sending the nachos back to get them without the half head of lettuce that was undesired) and our service was good and our glasses were usually full...overall a good visit and I'd go back and try some of the other things I saw on the menu! Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I having eaten here many times, but am quite disappointed that after going there on my lunch hour today, my co-worker and I waited approx. 15 minutes after being seated and were not approached by any of the wait staff to take our drink requests. There were several empty tables,  pointing to the fact they were not excessively busy -- it was closer to 1 pm so maybe the big lunch crowd had passed. At this point we decided to leave for another eating establishment that consistently offers great service and food. Not sure the reasoning for this, but they need to know there was a gross error made in customer service today."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. Smelled great walking in. Our food came slow from the kitchen. My wife's BBQ salad was fine. I had brisket and hot links. Brisket was like eating roast beef from crockpot w/ sauce. Not how it's done in Texas. Sausage was greasy.  While eating, observed hostess trying to seat group of older people, one with a walker in an elevated booth. Just plain out stupid.  In future, I'm sticking w/ BBQ baked potato."}
{"text":"I love me some good BBQ and in NY we don't have this establishment and I love trying new places to eat as I travel. First time visiting this place and it was a great choice. The hostess was pleasant and our waitress was great. She was very helpful with the menu and tentative but not annoying. My Daughter also loves ribs and left those bones dry and devoured her fries which were very good. My son isn't a BBQ lover like us so he ordered his usual... Cheeseburger with a side of fruit lol. He said the burger tasted better than McDonalds lol. (I agree).  I ordered the 2 meats combo which comes with two sides.  I got ribs(4 big ribs) and the brisket. My sides were the baked beans and slaw. OMG, Everything was just great. The briskest fell off my fork from how tender it was and the ribs weren't overly sloppy with sauce and the meat was tender aswell. My wife had ordered the salad and a side of the Mac and cheese which was on point! We were stuffed but shared a chocolate pie that didn't even last 2 mins, We destroyed it. I definitely recommend this place and will make it a must to eat here the next time we come to NC."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place and it was definitely worth the wait!  The staff here are all very welcoming! We were greeted at the front door like old friends. That was an excellent first impression!  Being newbies, my friend and I were easily overwhelmed because we didn't know what to order. Our waitress was fantastic! She brought out samples of their most popular dishes and those heavenly little cheese biscuits!   We finally made a decision, I ordered the brisket and pulled pork with mac and cheese (of course) and collards. First, they are not shy with the portion sizes here! Second, the brisket and pulled pork were both so tender and full of flavor! Like slap yo momma....flavorful. (sorry mom) I couldn't decide on which one I liked more. And let's not forget about the sides, both the mac and cheese and collards were delish!  Overall, it was a fantastic meal with really good service....and what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Me and a co-worker came here for lunch today to try this place out since it just opened recently.  When we pulled in the parking lot was really crowded, which meant it was pretty packed inside too.  We sat in the bar so we didn't have to wait for a table.  Placed our orders and then our waiter brought us a basket of bread.  We ate those right up and then sat there for about 5 minutes, hoping our food would be coming soon. It still wasn't ready (we both ordered pulled pork sandwiches with one side) so our waiter offered us more bread.  Still waiting, no food, no bread.  Our waiter comes back and says the bread was still baking and that our food was almost ready.  Finally, about 10 minutes later, our bread came, and then about 5 minutes after our food arrived.  They mixed up our orders (I had my sandwich on a bun with mac and cheese, my co-worker had his on sourdough with mashed potatoes.  My sandwich was on the plate with mashed potatoes and his sandwich on mine.)  Anyway, we only had to swap our sandwiches so that wasn't too big of a deal but it was a little annoying especially since we had to wait a little long for what I would imagine wasn't a difficult thing to make.  So, the pork was good but a little dry in parts, I had to add more bbq sauce to each bite so that I wouldn't have to chew so much.  The mac and cheese was a little too creamy for me, not the best.  Our waiter asked if we needed more water once but never did fill it, we had to ask another worker to get it.  I did finish my plate but it wasn't anything I'm dying to go back for!"}
{"text":"New to NC but not to barbecue. Stopped in here since it was near my home and I'm on a mission to try every barbecue joint in the area. Got the pulled pork sliders which were very flavorful with just the right amount of smoke. Also ordered the ribs with beans and fries as my sides. They have both sweet and spicy sauces if you need to add more flavor. The ribs were moist, tender and cooked with a nice crust. Overall the barbecue here was good not great or world class. Someone must have complained about the service here before since everyone but the dishwashers came by our table to ask us how our food was. I'd return to try out some of their other menu items but if I have out of town friends coming by, our barbecue destination is 521 a few miles down the road."}
{"text":"Simply put, Jim n Nicks is the Applebees of BBQ. That is the best description I can give. Its that exact level of quality and taste. I am surprised that BBQ of this caliber would get such high ratings in NC which has some of the best barbecue in the entire USA.  The waitress started off by telling us that their biscuits were to die for. After tasting their cheese biscuits I was super disappointed. This place is nothing compared to Red Lobster cheese biscuits and they were very bland.  My mom and I both got BBQ. My mom was completely underwhelmed by the pulled pork. It tasted like Lloyds. I was very disappointed with the brisket. It was really poor quality meat and tasted like it hadn't been smoked or slow cooked. The potato salad was average as were the other sides. They have great blue cheese dressing.  It wasn't that great and we weren't content with what we got for the price. I wouldn't go back. However, it is an average choice if you're looking for a Ruby Tuesday's type meal or if you haven't experienced authentic BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, and more than you can eat! A  little pricey but worth it, the brisket is amazing!"}
{"text":"BBQ nachos! Very good. Generous portion and choice of chicken, pork or beef (these have pork). I always order an extra side of pico de gallo because it's that good and they also have good queso- the white kind, not that gelatinous Velveeta crap."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!!  I loved both the smoked turkey and brisket. They only have 2 sauces, but they complement the meat perfectly (tomato based with a hint of spice or habanero). I got the baked beans and fries as my sides.  Both were delicious!!  They have a full allergen list and are gluten free friendly.  Don't get the fries if you are gluten free and sensitive to fryer contamination."}
{"text":"This location got less stars, because our waitress was just a pill. We drove all the way from Raleigh to eat here because we had been to the location in Charleston and loved the Pork Chop. Well, nomore pork chop!! We were ok with that though because theres so many great options on the menu that you can find something else thats great and delish. Food = so delicious. Service = 1 star.  Our waitress brought the wrong drinks. She forgot side items. She never refilled drinks during our meal. She never asked us how food was. She never apologized for any of her screw ups. And never put any real effort into making us feel welcome. Thank god the brisket was heaven and made up for it.  By the way, you will smell like a smokehouse when you leave but thats ok if your experience was good! It just kept me hungry into the night but well worth it."}
{"text":"Attentive service, good prices and varied menu. Complimentary  cheese biscuits were soft and mild.  Thought the pork was moist , yet needed more smokiness. The collards were just ok, however; the potato salad was very tasty.If you do not like bell peppers and onions, then skip.  Dessert was banana pudding  or variety of pie slices. Will make room next time."}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment! I've had better barbecue in Salt Lake City! The ribs were lacking in meat and flavor. The sausage was just ok, again lacking in flavor. The mac and cheese was yummy, but the potato salad wasn't that great, though I do have a very specific palate for my grandma's Arkansas recipe, and few places have lived up to it. We had banana pudding, again, with my grandmother's recipe as the gauge for goodness. This pudding was disgusting! And I never leave dessert unfinished! The bananas were brown and slimy, the \"pudding\" had the consistency of gritty, gooey, slime and had a very weird flavor! Finally, the server was lacking in the basic friendliness and warmth that one would expect from a server! He shuffled around and seemed to slam dishes down on the table. It felt like we were intruding on his time. The experience overall was very different from the reviews we read on Yelp. Considering we are only going to be in the area for a very short time we are bummed that we chose this place for our NC bbq experience!"}
{"text":"So to begin with my waitress was slow and could have cared less about making us happy. I ordered the bbq nachos and they came out cold. My son had the Turkey sandwich and the bottom bun was so soggy you could have rung it out. My daughters Mac and cheese was so cold it was like they took it out of the refrigerator. We were all very disappointed. I have been here several times and sometimes it's a great experience and other times it's like a 5 year old is running the show."}
{"text":"Great service and hospitality. Sat on the patio with my dog who loves the biscuits and pulled chicken.  Tasha was our server and was excellent.  Manager gave my dog 2 free plates of chicken because he was still hungry after one lol. Best potatoes salad and coconut pie!"}
{"text":"It was my turn to buy lunch for the office so I grabbed the P-Card and went around the corner to Jim 'N Nick's (for my first time).  I got the BBQ PORK COMMUNITY MEAL FOR 12 and we got soooooo much food!!  They gave us everything we needed too, plates, spoons, tongs, cups and even sweeteners for our tea.  Both the food quality and the service were excellent.  Take out staff were knowledgeable about the menu and staff helped me carry the food bags out to my car and even got me a drink for the ride back to the office!!  The smoked pork was excellent with a visible smoke ring and great BBQ sauce.  I'm ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THEIR RECIPE FOR BAKED BEANS AND MACARONI AND CHEESE.....  The beans were sweet and tangy with lots of bacon and what appeared to be relish- a perfect amount too, creating a unique flavor that makes you go back for more.  When I phoned the restaurant because I lost my receipt, Manager TREY took charge, found the copy of the charge slip, phoned me back and emailed me the copy!!!  Trey was most helpful and provided excellent customer service!!  I highly recommend that you try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Can I just tell you our all around experience was wonderful. Some of the best bbq we have EVER had. As soon as you walk in the door you smell that delicious bbq being smoked in the back. You also get delicious warm cheese biscuits while you wait and they are small enough that they don't fill you up before you eat your meals. Our waitress, Tica, was handling 5 other tables and still kept on top of our table. All of Tica's  recommendations were spot on. The riblets appetizer was mouth wateringly delicious. My husband got the Carolina pulled pork sandwich with the collards as his side dish. He said the collards were delicious and the sandwich was definitely worth ordering. I got the brisket sandwich with the Mac and cheese as my side. The brisket was cooked perfectly and the serving was huge! The Mac and cheese had lots of flavor but was just a tad too thick for my liking. Then we decided to order the banana pudding for dessert. OH MY GOD it was delicioussssss and the perfect amount for us to share after such a big meal. To say we left completely satisfied would be an understatement. We are visiting from Florida, looking to move up here and so happy we experienced this kind of delicious. You should try going. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Alright look, I'm a california girl.  I don't know much about authentic BBQ really... but I do know what tastes good.  IDK what it is about the beans here, but they are like crack.  I would come here and just eat the beans.  Wholly mother of god they are good.  I had a pulled pork sandwich that was good.  It lacked spice but I fixed that right up with their habanero bbq sauce.  That sauce was so damn good I just wanted to put the bottle in my purse.  Then I realized I couldn't take it on the plane... so I held back.  We had six people (well, 5 and a bebe), and the bill was only $80.  Not bad.  Service was awesome.  Just don't serve me that sweet tea when I order tea, OK?!  If I don't use words like, \"y'all\" when I order, then understand that we west coasters don't get down with that sugar water.  Blehhhhhhchh.  When I put a little of the habanero sauce in my beans it's like, OMG, this might just be the best thing eva. EVAHHHHHHHH"}
{"text":"We got the three meat sampler with two sides and it was delicious. Great service. Cold beer and quick food delivery."}
{"text":"I'm a big time bbq snob, but I look forward to going to this place every time! I love the atmosphere, it puts you in the mindset for good bbq. Their selection is huge! Even if you don't like pulled pork, there's something for you! Ribs, brisket, chicken, turkey, plus all of the ridiculous sides. I love the double-stack sandwich: pulled pork and brisket with a double-bun! The corn bread is so good you'll fill up on it if you're not careful. Great service, great food, you gotta check it out."}
{"text":"Food was decent but barely warm when it arrived at table and it took quite a while to arrive. Seems like it may have sat out too long before waitress picked it up to deliver to table. Service was ok but not super attentive with refilling drinks."}
{"text":"I didn't actually get to try any food to tell you how it is. The person who greeted us...wasn't that friendly to start with. Then we sit and we order a couple apps and some waters...the server wasn't all that friendly. When asked what he recommended he said the pork even over the brisket. Ok perfect.....but, maybe telling us they didn't have any would be cool. On top of that, they were out of both appetizers we ordered and the brisket too. I understand it was a half hour before closing, and fine if you are really out of these things. BUT could maybe say something when we walk in...not waiting 20mins for our server...who didn't want to break the news to us, but had someone else do it."}
{"text":"The BBQ is really good. I had the beef. Other family members had the pork. It was really tasty, and the portions were plentiful.  The mac & cheese was cheesy - very good. The slaw was great. I'm told the bake beans have some zing. The local craft IPA was a perfect match. This is part of a southern chain, but you wouldn't know it by the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Ok so u all know I usually complain about either he sauce or the ribs or the sides. This place has it all. All home made and great. Two types of sauce both are a molasses style but one hot and one sweet. Then the ribs omg perfect smoke ring. I got Mac and cheese as side and onion rings would recommend both!!!! I guess this place is a chain. About thirty restaurants but I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. The restaurant and decor are fine. Service is very good. I am only rating three stars because the portions are stingy."}
{"text":"When we cheat on our diet, this is who we cheat with!  We bring all visitors here first when they come to Charlotte.  My happy place is the deliciously tender and flavorful Baby Back Ribs and the flakey, mouthwatering Fried Catfish.  My husband prefers the habanero sauce, but I use the regular.    The potato salad is our go-to.   The mac and cheese is so rich and delicious, but we stay away from it now.   Their starter cheese biscuits are like a wonderful desert and the Sweet tea is just right.    Their smoked turkey is also delicious, but we can't seem to pry ourselves from our usual order.    I'm sure the rest is fantastic, but we are creatures of habit.  So far the customer service has been exceptional.  So, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Really good bbq! I recommend getting the plate where you can get multiple meats, it's well worth it. Their bread is very different but also amazing. I recommend this place to anyone who likes bbq, they will have wanting to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic culinary adventure at Jim N Nick's. I had the barbecue pork sandwich and Brunswick stew. My wife ate a pig in the garden salad, my daughter had and son had chicken strips. Everything was perfectly cooked; the service was quick. The server even brought a bowl of water for our dog. Once again I couldn't be happier with our choice."}
{"text":"Jim N Nick's never lets me down. I use to eat at their locations in Atlanta when there for work. This location meets the same standards. Delicious food and very tasty corn bread/rolls. The chips are really good too. An odd thing to compliment but give them a try and you'll see what I mean. I will say the sauce seems to have changed over time, it's not as good as I remember. The meat however it's still perfectly prepared. All of the meat, doesn't matter which."}
{"text":"This place has such good food, it's unbelievable. I ordered a catering tray for my client, and all of the smoked meats were incredible. Some of the best collard greens and potato salad I've had in a long time. Came back and got the Nashville Hot Chicken- very spicy, but incredibly moist, flavorful, and crunchy. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a trip to the mall because I wanted some BBQ. They did not disappoint. I ordered the loaded baked potato with brisket on top. It was good but I'll never do that again, too many carbs. I ate what I could and tossed the rest. Then I ordered a brisket sandwich to go and that was delicious also. The food and the service was good and I can't wait to go back and try some other things that I saw on the menu."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here, good food, good service.  Both times have been satisfied with my meal.  Not an exciting review I know, but if you are hungry and want BBQ then you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid beef brisket! Yummy cheesy mini muffins. They accommodated a party of 20 with 30 minutes notice! Very attentative and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service, we have been a few times since they opened and am glad we did. A step above all the other bar b q places around. Consistent food with consistent service. I am very happy they opened it up in this location. I am trying to make this a regular place to go on the weeknights."}
{"text":"Usually would give them a 5 but last night they had too much pepper in mashed potatoes, gravy and sorry but collards were weird tasting.  Please don't put so much pepper in everything.  You have pepper on table if customer wants more pepper.  Just because cook likes it doesnt mean customer likes the taste or they may have dietary restrictions.  Waiter staff was excellent.  Pork ribs and smoked turkey was excellent."}
{"text":"Second visit.   Very disappointed. Speechless.  When we dined in a few days ago, everything was perfect.    Well, today...I did a take out and it went horribly bad. Baby back ribs were dry. Not even Applebee's quality.   Did not have the smoked flavor at all.  It tasted and smelled like a very cheap I mean cheap ham.  Tough meat. Slaw was not fresh and they put too much pickles on the top of my ribs.  Do not know why they packaged pickles with the ribs.  Too much.  It ruined it.  Biscuits were the only thing that were worth eating.         First visit.   1. Front desk- very friendly staff.  I was welcomed right away   2. Cheese biscuits- best biscuits I have ever had.  Oh my good. Fresh warm soft bitterly cheese biscuits.   3. Baby back ribs- fall off the bone. Do not need Sauce.  Came out perfect. Yum....  4. Collard greens- very delicious.   5. Claw- best I have ever had.  Fresh. Vinegar and sweet tangy taste is a perfect match with my ribs.   6. Fries- I was really good.  Did not have much since my ribs were so good. I normally would finish the fries before I finish my main dish but this time.. Nah.  I love my ribs so much.   7. Pulled pork/ Carolina style bbq- it was just right amount of vinegar and it was not dried out.  Flavor was again... Perfect.   Ps. Had a delightful chat with the kitchen manager bob.  He said no freezer is used. In fact they do not have one. Everything is prepared fresh.   We are most defiantly coming back here.   Oh btw... Our server David was awesome.   Good job!!!!"}
{"text":"This will be a very long review but please take the time to read it because Jim 'N Nicks have earned customers for life.  The week before our small wedding was chaos. LOST dresses, I broke a toe, sickness, the venue had an emergency and we needed to relocate 24 hours before the event which caused catering hiccups. To say it was stressful is an understatement we needed to find food for 28 people. I called several restaurants in Charlotte to either be quoted gouged prices or to be told it is the weekend before Christmas and we are too booked to help. So I thought about what our family loves to eat and I took a chance and called Jim 'N Nicks.  I left a message for Catering and explained the chaos of the week and that we simply wanted to feed our guests. I even said if I can't do catering we will order plates to go for everyone. I was thrilled when I was called back by Katie and told it wasn't a problem. I placed our order and was looking forward to picking it up the next day. I had several other stressful things to figure out and felt relieved that was done.  An hour later Katie called back and said that with the stress and chaos we had that week that they wanted to help our trip to the aisle be less stressful. When we would go pick up the food it was on the house that Jim 'N Nicks would be covering the order for our family. I was in shock because the only thing going right was my husband and I would do whatever was necessary to celebrate our love with our family and friends. I told her Thank you but we were not expecting that and her response that she couldn't believe how calm we were about it made them want to do something kind to help change things for us. She wished us a lifetime of love and happiness and assured us that our order would be waiting for us at the arranged time.  Our family and friends loved the food. They devoured it going back for seconds and complimented us on how laid back but amazing the food was. It was authentic to our family and ended up being the best thing to go wrong.   Thank you Jim 'N Nicks for going above and beyond what anyone would ever imagine. Thank you for making our day less stressful and delicious! You have earned customers for life!"}
{"text":"2nd time eating here, and have not been disappointed. Got the pulled chicken and it was more than enough. Staff was very nice and helpful. This place will always have my business!!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken special. The craft beer was incredible. Vanilla wafer pudding was tasty. Large screen TVs for football games is the best!"}
{"text":"Since we've moved here Jim 'N Nick's has continued to disappoint us.  At first this place was great.  Good food, good portions.  But lately they have been skimping on their portion sizes.  Once my husband mentioned the change in portions and his waitress basically flipped out saying they haven't changed.  Last night was the last night we are going to Jim 'N Nicks.  The sandwiches have shrunk, the mac n cheese (which use to be delicious) was horrible.  We will now go to Mac's Speedshop for our BBQ cravings."}
{"text":"Brisket, pork hot links, Mac n cheese, corn in Alabama white sauce, cheese muffins, and coconut cream pie.....excellent!  Service started out a little slow put the server pushed our orders through and kept our drinks full.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Huge portions of brisker. Smoked over oak, the smoke went all the way through the beef. The sides were typical for this area.  The homemade pecan pie was to die for."}
{"text":"I have been to Jim and Nick's a couple of times. Always great service. The food is good and resonably priced. I have tried their turkey, chicken and their ribs. All were great tasting. I would recommend it if you wanted Bar-B-Que. Great flavor, Great Venue, Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Gonna make this short. The food sucks. Can't believe this place exist in the land of Lexington style BBQ. Server was nice. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"I must preface this review with the fact that this location has been open for 5 days. Start up issues are a real challenges for any business but....when this is your 37th store you've learned some valuable lessons.  J 'n N's have turned their learnings into processes that have made this startup better than most! The attitude of their Team members reflects the value placed on training! Customer satisfaction is evident from the host to the bartender to the servers and roving management types! All are well schooled in the details of their large menu and your enjoyment.  The bar is well stocked with a variety of bee choices and an upper end array of bourbons. But the Kentucky Ale is the main event if you like quality beer/ale. Ask for a sample and you be the judge! The bar keeps knew the menu backward and forwards and helped pass the :45 wait.  Eat at the bar if you like. They'll serve your beverage and a basket of mini cheese muffins. Don't eat to many or you'll spoil you meal. I dare you to eat just one!  My Bride ordered the Carolina BBQ sandwich, slaw and hand cut fries. The Q was flavorful, albeit a bit dry. The slaw was delicious but the fries were barely warm but well seasoned. Our server was happy to bring additional vinegar based sauce which is not available on the table.  House sauce and a habanero sauce were at arms length.  I ordered the 2 meat combo ; my choices being the classic pulled pork and the beef brisket, fries and collard greens. Being a BIG fan for the \"bark\" I ordered extra. The brisket was moist and the outside slices were flavorfully delicious. The Classic Q was barkless. When the manager asked how our dinner was I mention the lack of bark. He fixed that in short order. Only disappointment was the food temperature. Not cold and not hot.......barely warm and definitely no steam!  So let's summarize: great staff, a comfortable dining space, good food and a knack for Customer Service. To early to tell how well J 'n N's will hold up to the local Q shacks but only time will tell."}
{"text":"The sides are great, especially creamed collards and Mac n cheese. Pulled pork is great, sausage is ok. But the pimento cheese sandwich...big mistake ordering this! Bleh! It's the nasty, soupy kind of pimento cheese with very strange bacon jam on top. It doesn't work. They're very kid friendly an busy without having long waits."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the staff experience and not the food. Our food hasn't arrived yet but I'm not waiting.   We came in and sat at the bar. We were here about seven minutes watching everyone watch us or rather ignore us. I spoke up and someone went to fetch the bartender. She seemed nice enough and got on us right away. I gather she was doing side work out of sight thinking the staff would alert her if anyone sat down at the bar. Not so. The staff here has a depressed demeanor about then and it shows on their faces. No smile just a worn down countenance.    What struck me is before I sat down I washed up in the restroom. The waste basket was overflowing with paper towels. Ok it was right after lunch on Sunday I'll give them that. However, three employees used that restroom after me and none on them bothered to spend the ten seconds needed to pick up around the wast basket and straighten up.   So it appears that everyone I can see has a \"not my job\" attitude. Shame really, I've always enjoyed J&N's in other cities.   Lunch done and it was fine, but staff here makes it a bummer in spite of tasty food."}
{"text":"Overrated! A bit pricey, had ribs very greasy, mac and cheese dry, collard greens not very exciting! Fried chicken breast cooked well but just ok. Soup of the day, some kind of vegetables was tasty. Ran out of onion rings? Wife had 3 meat combo, ribs greasy and end pieces, pulled pork, dry, brisket was shredded like all meats needed lots of sauce. Home made potato chips just fair Did pour a good glass of wine, highlight of our visit. Waitress was ok as was service. Know there has to be better barbecue in this area! Wouldn't return!!!"}
{"text":"The BBQ Train Stops @ JIM 'N Nick's...  I am not saying I know everything there is to know about BBQ, but I can say I have dined at dozens of BBQ places up and down the east coast, and in my humble opinion, Jim 'N Nick's can stack up to any of them - chain or not!    It starts with that classic, smokey BBQ smell wafting through your nostrils the second you enter the spacious parking lot, and get out of your vehicle.  Upon entering and being seated, a friendly server came right over and took our drinks orders.  Feeling wild and crazy, I decided to go with the Arnold Palmer, instead of my standard sweet tea order when at BBQ restaurants.  I can say that my Palmer was perfect, and not rot-your-teeth-out sweet either.    As for the food - I ordered the half rack of ribs (see pics) with baked beans and mac-n-cheese.  My gf ordered the veggie plate (which was pretty much  an entree with three sides) - she got fries, mac-n-cheese and collard greens (see pics).  After a short wait, we received our food, took our usual pictures for all you Yelpers out there, and dug right in!   My gf and I were both thoroughly impressed.  The ribs were superb - tender, moist, full of smokey flavor, and truly fall-off-the-bone!  There's nothing worse than a restaurant that advertises fall-off-the-bone ribs, and the ribs are stuck together like Siamese twins!  I can give the ribs my full endorsement.    Don't even get me started on the sides - the mac-n-cheese and baked beans.  They were both full of savory goodness, and tasted more like something your grandma would make over Thanksgiving than something served at a chain restaurant.  I mean, there are still many places out there serving up Kraft box, mac-n-cheese, and calling it \"homemade\" - not Jim 'N Nicks.  The baked beans were as good as any I've had in recent memory.  They were seasoned with pulled pork and you could actually see the chunks of pulled pork in the bowl.   Even though I might receive some negative feedback for this, I am gonna go ahead and put it out there anyway - Jim 'N Nicks is as good as any BBQ establishment in the Charlotte area.   Is it the best BBQ I've ever had? No, of course not, but its far from average, and way better than many of the locally owned \"legends\" that sadly  populate the greater Charlotte area.  The next time I think of going to Mac's, I will probably pass, and go check out the new kid on the block -  Jim 'N Nick's!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  We had Dee as our waitress and she was so welcoming to our party of 8.  She had a wonderful bubbly personality and gave us great suggestions on dinner.  Great experience for us, the food was great especially the big potato and the piggy salad.  Will return in the future based on our great experience!"}
{"text":"We read reviews on this place ahead of time saying they had a big beer selection, but we saw they only had 4 on top. The waiter said they use to have a huge bar and they downsized it. They also stopped doing beer and drink specials. The beer I liked, they stop carrying. They also had food \"specials\" yet, they werent any different from what was on the menu nor a price difference. The cheeze biscuts or conrbread, whatever they were, are VERY addictive! We got the brisket and it was very good. Tender and juicy on a nice roll. Mac n Cheese is homemade and good but a VERY small portion. I had a half and half tea/lemonade, decent. Service was speedy. I also had the peanut butter pie for desert, very yummie. Its more of a family place now and certainly not a place to go for drinks. Im not sure why they downsized their menu, but thats not a good sign."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable.  I am obsessed with their bread basket. I forget what it was...some sort of cheddar corn muffin/biscuit...but I can't stop thinking about them. Warm fluffy and fresh to death.  We went through two entire baskets. Like on par, if not better, than Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits. The service was equally phenomenal. Our waitress was so adorably friendly and funny. The manager stopped by to welcome us to town.  It was just a wonderful experience and the food was top notch. The pork ribs basically fell off the bone, the brisket was tender and had a nice char on the outer layer. Only wish is that they open a location on Long Island!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a hotel. I'd never heard of this place, but was told that it rivaled Lexington BBQ (a tall statement as LBBQ is just awesome). Walked in and it felt homey. Staff was very friendly and the food was very good. Pulled pork was cooked great and the fried chips were very good as well. All in all a definite thumbs up."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about. I live at the apartment complex right beside this place so I have tried  it several times and the food is just blah. Definitely better barbecue choices in Charlotte. Best thing is the cheddar bread/biscuits."}
{"text":"Service is way too slow!! Looks like they are at 60 to 70 capacity at the most.... When your server greets you by saying \"sorry for the wait...\" You might be in for a doozy... Too many other nice restaurants around to wanna come back here to waste more time..."}
{"text":"Everything our party had was good. I'm not a fan of runny BBQ sauce though, especially the vinegary stuff, but the meat was all good. The biscuits were delicious. I would go back again for the biscuits alone."}
{"text":"Tried this place with the family and now it's our go to place for BBQ.   We love the pulled pork and brisket.   The place  is always jam packed but we have never waited to sit even with a party of 9.  Something has to be said if the Police are always picking up food there, it has to be good."}
{"text":"Every time I drive past this place on 160, I'm curious. Giant tin roof, lots of scattered lighting fixtures. What was this place about? On my last trip home, I finally decided to give in to my curiosity and gave it a try.  Decent service. Decent food. Nothing to get overly excited about, but nothing to say \"no\" to.   Everyone else seems to be obsessed with the corn bread cheese biscuit things. Usually I'm all about some sinful carby treats, but these were not worth the calories, in my opinion. Get me one of those Red Lobster biscuits and we'll talk.   The BBQ was average -- the kind that you get out of the south and people freak out over...but when you're actually in the Carolinas and you're serving BBQ like this...I'm not impressed.   I will say the Mac-n-Cheese was pretty legit and yummy.   Bottom line, if you're not super duper into finding the best BBQ, this place is perfectly fine. It would be a great place to take a family out for lunch. But if you're looking for something super delicious and special, this ain't it. Keep on looking, kiddies."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the locals. So we tried it and it was very good. The parking lot was full but then again we went on a Saturday night. Love these little cheese biscuits even though they look like mini muffins. Had the ribs,beef brisket,mashed taters with gravy, Mac and cheese was goooood. Very cheesy and creamy just how I like it and collard greens had a smoky taste to it. Which I also like. The only thing I didn't like was the ribs had an over powering smoky taste to them. I had to rub the BBQ sauce they give you to even it out. But still good. I will be going back and suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since moving to the Concord area. I've enjoyed myself each time I've been here. Food has been good each time, large portions, the cornbread biscuits are amazing! The BBQ is solid.   The wait staff is nice, but you can go awhile with out being checked on, and if you are in a rush, you might as well go somewhere else, they are in no worry to rush you out of there. Which is a good thing some times if you have time to spare, if you are in a rush, obviously not the best. Also, means you should ration your drink, can go a little longer than you should with a empty cup.  I haven't need to seat a large party, but I've been there while a few were in attendance, it seemed the staff was more than willing to make arrangements for large parties."}
{"text":"Loved it !   Awesome hot links!   We loved loved our waitress Essence!!!!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Obviously the barbecue here is amazing (the smell of hickory smoke fills the air for miles and makes you INSTANTLY hungry), but there are a lot of things this place does well that shouldn't be ignored in favor of gushing about pulled-pork. They have one of my favorite Greek salads EVER (including crazy good fresh feta and imported olives), incredible cocktail specials that are good all day (no just for happy hour), and the Taco Tuesdays (pulled pork or pulled chicken tacos) will blow your mind and redefine your favorite way to eat barbecue. The perfectly-brewed sweet tea and addictive cheese biscuits are too good to pass up, too, but don't be surprised when you gain a few lbs.--they're well worth an extra trip to the gym."}
{"text":"Great sides made daily. The creamed collards are the kind of great that makes you eat them slowly and sad when their gone.  Try the brisket."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Barbarque places... the wait staff is awesome at everything on the menu is awesome"}
{"text":"Great food !!!  Excellent chicken tenders!!!  Their honey mustard is soooo good !!!!  Yummy yummy cheese biscuits !!!  Their Mac n cheese is too cheesy for me."}
{"text":"After spending hours at Lowes doing some shopping, my wife and kids decided to try out Jim 'N Nicks BBQ because it was located close by, we were hungry and Jim 'N Nicks had recently opened in Indian Land. Before you get to the restaurant, the bbq smell from outside is very inviting. As soon as you walk in you can smell the aroma of smoking wood which made us even more hungry than what we were. Also when you walk in you will see it's a decent size restaurant but not too big, the decor doesn't really makes me think of BBQ but of a steakhouse restaurant but anyway, it works . The wait time wasn't too bad for a brand new restaurant and we were seated within roughly 10 minutes each time.   My wife and I decided to order a two meats combo plate because we were told it would feed both of us but that didn't quite live up to the hype. I was still hungry but my wife was content. The meal was decent along with the trimmings, french fries and collard greens but it seemed to lack something. The children also had a two meat combo plate and it did fill them up, they really like the food and had no complaints. The wait staff, I assume is still working out the kinks because there were several times where we wondered if our waitress was kidnapped, I joke but seriously they were MIA more than once. It was annoying  We have since been back several times because the kids like to eat here but if it's just my wife and I then we will go someplace else. Also, I not a fan of fatty, salty food definitely no fault of the restaurant. If you're close by and like bbq, you won't go wrong at Jim 'N Nicks but you may not be extremely thrilled either. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and the service was great but the food not so much.  The turkey didn't taste great but the fries were excellent."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays are the best nights at Jim N' Nick's, but lately I have been going and they have messed up my order multiple times. My steak taco which was supposed to be fish was fed to my dog because my husband thought it was left overs... but no it was just my taco dinner. I am highly upset considering the time before this they wrapped my taco in a quesadilla wrap with cheese plus the taco wrap which is not how it is supposed to be made. Jim N' Nick's you need to fix this and get your takeout window under control!"}
{"text":"Had a loaded baked potato with smoked chicken. The potato was huge and the chicken used was tender and very flavorful!    Hubby had the baby backs and said they were really good (and a comment of that sort from him is extremely rare for anything not prepared in my kitchen).  He wanted brisket but they were out.    My daughter (11 yrs) had the kids slider plate, we thought it came with two but it was only one and we ended up having to order a second slider for her because she wasn't full and she thought they were very yummy.  She had a side of Mac and cheese but didn't like it, we swapped it out for fries which were fresh cut and well seasoned and went well with the homemade ranch they have :)  My son had the kids drummies plate and I made them mild vs plain and they had a bit more kick than he was accustomed to but he still ate them because they were also yummy.  Lemonade was yummy and so was the sweet tea.  We all could do without the cheese rolls... A bit too sweet for our liking...  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Meat smoked on site, very smoky meat, but a bit boring.  Moist and tender, but I felt the strong smoking drowned out natural flavor of brisket and chicken."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We were literally heading to another restaurant but stopped for gas & my husband spotted Jim n Nick's so we looked them up on Yelp. Our party of 11 voted to give it a try. Ohhhh I'm so glad we did. EVERYTHING was good! Tasted like we made it at home & my family can cook! Natalie & Will were great. The service could not have been better. We are from out of town, but when back in this area annually we'll be back! Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of bbq. .. This place is amazing. If your thinking of going somewhere else forget it.. brisket amazing. Service great. Pork mac and cheese. just go here and be happy"}
{"text":"Great food! We're from up north (PA). Stopped by because we were hungry and a place that's busy at 11:30 am on a weekday has to be good! Not disappointed. I'm not much of a meat eater. Loved the southern chop salad! My husband tried both chicken and pork barbecue. Both were excellent! But the deviled eggs were delicious! We ordered a second order to go!"}
{"text":"I hate to admit that I go to a chain for BBQ, but darn Jim N Nicks is good! Not great but good.  Those muffins are like the food of the gods, you cant stop eating them. The pulled pork is always solid and the brisket has never let me down either.  I do like the smoked chicken with Alabama white sauce, if you have never had the white sauce do your self  a favor and try that chicken! Outside of BBQ they do a great job with burgers and steaks so the place appeals to my family even if they don't want BBQ.  Food: 3.5 Sporks Service: 3 Sporks Atmosphere: 3 Sporks Sweet Tea: 4 Sporks Value: 3 Sporks Local Beer: 2 Sporks"}
{"text":"Happy new year! We had our New Year's Day lucky meal at Jim n Nicks this year, and as usual, it did not disappoint! Pulled pork, collards, black eyed peas, and the corn muffins..... mmmmm, yummy! I am not a collard fan, but these were quite delish!   The server was polite and very attentive as usual! We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great find. Very high quality BBQ with amazing service. This place is just off the highway and is easy on/off and plenty of parking. So if your are driving through, this is a great place to take a break from a road trip."}
{"text":"First time at the Indian Trail location for takeout. As always food hot and good. I had wings and macroni cheese. The girl working was nice  and point. She refill my tea. Definitely be going back for lunch."}
{"text":"I recently moved to North Carolina, and clearly, this is the place for good bbq. I was told to go to Jim n Nick's for really good food. I ordered the 3 meat combo with spare ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. My two trimmings (sides) were collars greens and potato salad and I ordered a sweet tea to drink. My boyfriend ordered the 2 lb spare rib plate with Mac and cheese and fries with a Dorothy's peach iced tea.   The ribs were smoked perfectly, and fall off the bone tender. Brisket and pulled pork was tender as well and full of smoked flavor. The collard greens were very flavorful, not bland at all, and the potato salad was delicious!! I am very picky about potato salad, by this was absolutely delicious, I just wish they gave you more of it, but I had enough meat. The complimentary biscuits were tasty and hot as well.   I loved the atmosphere and the smell of the wood smoke in the air. When you walk in here, you know you are in a TRUE barbecue joint!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I have ever had and their Mac n cheese is to die for!! Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere has always been good as well. A Must try!!!"}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich was absolutely amazing. It was so large I couldn't figure out how to eat it! Kids meal was only three dollars, excellent service and ample parking. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The usual place I go to eat in the Concord Mills area was closed on Monday. There's not a lot of diversity in the area. The Mexican options are rather pallid and most everything else is American food, which I'm not exactly a fan. I do like barbecue - don't really crave it - but the Yelp reviews for Jim n Nick's were pretty good so I gave it a shot.  I wasn't expecting much considering it's a chain but ended up being pleasantly surprised. Started off with the wings which were excellent. Only eight in the serving but they were huge meaty wings, nicely smoked. Would have like a little more celery and carrots with it but a minor quibble.  Order the beef brisket platter and was really impressed by the meat. It was tender and juicy with nice smoke marks; I couldn't believe I was eating brisket. The potato salad was fresh; the green bell pepper bits were still crisp. Collard greens were perfectly cooked with nice chunks of pork for flavor. My husband got a platter with multiple items. I tried some of the sausage which was made in house and nicely flavored.  Also tried the pork butt and it was well smoked and juicy as well. All the meats used were of very high quality. I was not a fan of the barbecue sauce; even the habanero barbecue sauce tasted too sweet.  The service was fabulous, we never waited for anything and the waitress had no  problems going to the kitchen to find out if certain items were gluten free. The venue itself was decorated in that contrived retro that seems to be so  popular with designers today. All in all I enjoyed my meal and would certainly come back."}
{"text":"?????????????"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for lunch. Service was absolutely excellent. Food was good and very stuffing. Not the best BBQ I've ever had but was good. Will definitely be back again.   PS   Biscuits are to die for"}
{"text":"Don't even think about getting the brisket. Not good at all. Place is just a OK. Not a place I would go again. It is in a great location though. Any why is the NC sanitary rating for this restaurant just 92.5. That may say a lot I guess."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for a half order of riblets.  The meat was cold and under cooked.  I had to bake at home for 20 minutes.  After hearing so many great things about Jim and Nick's, I was very disappointed.  I will not order take out from them again."}
{"text":"This Alabama based chain prides itself of some good ole southern based foods. I have dined at the ATL and Charlotte locations and have found all of them to be very similar and consistent.  The corn muffins are served straight from the oven. They can easily fill you up if not careful. After one bite of these mini muffins, if any portion is left you will find the actual corn within the muffin...  Managed to order 1 lb. of ribs with collards and the BBQ chips. No meed for sauce the ribs were nicely seasoned and hot. I did manage to reacquaint myself with the original sauce which although was not needed on the ribs easily compliments the meat. Collards with the smoked meat and, and BBQ chips--just as if they fell out of a bag of chips were both served. The food experience and service were all pleasant.   Good job!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite and we will probably not return. The meat was delish, but everything else was lacking. The sauce options were not good, the green beans and cabbage were way over salted and the sweet potatoes were all sugar and cinnamon. Additionally, our waitress had on way too much perfume or oil or whatever she was wearing. It was so offensive that it triggered my asthma and I had to use my inhaler before we even got our drinks. Our waitress also spent the majority of the time we were there chatting with the hostess, so when we needed something we had to go looking for her. Overall just not a great experience. The atmosphere was good though!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Steele Creek & they have yet to disappoint.  Pulled chicken sandwich & Garden salad with pulled chicken are my favs. Cheese biscuits are addicting!"}
{"text":"The brisket and peach tea were to die for...An excellent choice. I encourage you to eat at Jim 'n Nicks."}
{"text":"Really would rate this a 3.5 instead of a 3.   Short version: Nothing to write home about but nothing bad either. Overall, it's ok. Biscuits and Mac n Cheese are absolutely delicious though.  Long version: Hubs and I ordered the Smoked Riblets and Smoked Mild Wings for Appetizers, 3 meat combo for entree and one sweet tea and one unsweet peach tea for drinks.  Smoked Riblets were good. They were very tender and the meat fell off the bone nicely. Nothing spectacular about it, but good. The Smoked Wings, however, are not smoked. They don't taste like smoked wings and they don't have the characteristic pink/red coloration that happens with smoked meats. Maybe it's just the way they supposedly smoke them that makes them different? I don't know but I ain't buying it. Do they taste good? They are ok,  nothing remarkable. The bleu cheese sauce is pretty deplorable though; not a single chunk of bleu cheese and it was on the watery side.    For the 3 meat combo we chose Hot Links, Brisket and Pulled Pork. All 3 were good but none really stood out. They were served with no sauce, which is fine as all meats were moist and reasonably seasoned but I just happen to prefer saucy bbq.    The sauces on the table were their original sauce and the habanero sauce. I didn't care much for either as I tend to prefer more sweet sauces and these were more of a vinegar base. They were not bad, just not my preference. Out of the two, I liked the habanero more as it has really nice heat and smoky flavor but lacked the sweetness that I prefer.    For \"trimmings\" we ordered the Mac n Cheese and the collard greens. The Mac n Cheese was delicious. Not too dry, not overly cheesy, not over/under salted...it was great. The collard greens were ok. Again, not bad, just nothing remarkable about them.   Hubby's sweet tea was good. My unsweetened peach tea was unsweetened tea with diced peaches in syrup poured into it (I saw it get prepared at the bar). Tasted nothing like peach tea and I was disappointed to get something with syrup in it when I asked for an unsweetened beverage. Not that It made the tea any sweeter tasting but it makes avoiding sugar pointless.     Though our waitress was polite and attentive, she seemed kind of \"flat\" and brought us our check without us even asking for it or asking if we wanted dessert. That is a huge pet peeve of mine. She seemed like maybe she wasn't feeling well. She was on top of the hubby's drink refill (one cup is usually plenty for me) and did come around to check on us but then brought the tab unexpectedly.   The best things about our experience was the friendly hostess, the biscuits (oh my God, those biscuits were damn delicious) and the Mac n Cheese."}
{"text":"Went 3 times. The first time i ordered the ribs. Came out hot and some of the best i had. Came back a 2nd time and ordered same ribs, came.out cold,took forever, and just wasnt the same. Manager took them back to kitchen and came back smoking hot.i did not eat any of them..manager did a good job ,but once im dissatisfied, im done. 3rd time same.thing. i told the manager about the 1st and 2nd time, and let him know i wont return for a 4th, damn shame. If i liked cold ribs i would return but not wasting my time again."}
{"text":"First and definitely not the last time we come here. The hot links were so flavorful as well as that Max and cheese. It melts in your mouth! Top it off with some hot sauce and I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"Solid que and decent service.  A few weeks ago I went to Jim N Nicks to get some takeout dinner for a few people.  My gf was really wanting some choco pie from here so that's what I ordered.  As I am stubborn and don't check the bag I got home to realize they forgot the whole pie.  I called up to tell them what had happened and they sent me a gift card in a few days which was more than the amount of the pie to my house.  Ordered again last night and everything was delicious.  The ribs were a little overcooked, but other than it was solid again.  They have some delicious triple c on tap and this place is worth checking out if you have a hankering for some que."}
{"text":"So while this isn't Lexington BBQ I have to say I'm kind of a fan. I was hesitant about this place because it's a chain and well how good could it be. Well the answer is pretty darn good actually. My best friends parents use them for catering all the time and it's always really good. I figure if their catering/takeout is that good they must be even better in person. I plan on checking it out ASAP. So this review is specifically like I said for catering/takeout. Their pulled pork is super yummy. Again it's not on par with some good old fashion NC BBQ, however I think it's better than the other chain place down the road that everyone LOVES. So if you are looking for a quick pick up BBQ and you are down in Rivergate definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place has only been open a couple weeks and we have eaten there 4 times now. We crave the cheddar biscuits and their meats are wonderful. Have not had a bad experience yet. They have a large selection of whiskeys and scotches- but I'm more of a wine person,maybe they will add a few more selections by the glass sometime. I agree that they should give you the sauce on the side without having to ask and not assume people want it on top of their meats. The flavor is so good, sometimes you just don't need it. Totally recommend, can't wait till next time"}
{"text":"I would have to say I disagree with the previous review on one issue. While Jim N Nicks is a chain, and the decor is definitely chain-like, the food is not. Very good quality, super tasty and abundant. Always great service and friendly staff. We go there a few times a month. I love the Pig in the Potato Patch!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Everything is made fresh and from scratch.  Don't believe me, ask for a kitchen tour, they will happily show you how the magic happens"}
{"text":"Excellent smoke taste on their BBQ.  I had the ribs and brisket and it was amazing.  The smoke pit is on the premises.  Cant go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Opened in June 2008, Jim 'N Nicks BAR-B-Q, in Charlotte's Steele Creek area, is not your typical Bar-B-Q restaurant.  It's simply a great restaurant that happens to serve barbeque.  You step out of your car and are enveloped in the signature aroma of meats roasting slowly over hickory wood-stoked fires.   The brick building is airy and welcoming.  The front porch strung with colored lights is reminiscent of good old days when rocking on the porch with friends and sipping mint juleps on warm summer evenings was not considered indulgent.   Once inside, worries will melt away as you are warmly welcomed into the home-away-from-home of owners Jenne and Troy Taylor.  Immediately, you notice the slower pace and less frenetic atmosphere making the good old days ever more appealing.   The taste nirvana begins with a friendly server appearing at the tableside with a smile and a basket of steaming hot cheese biscuits which, to the taste buds, seem almost surreal.  To whet the whistle you have a choice of traditional beverages such as sweet tea and sodas; but the Jim 'N Nick's experience is not complete without Dave's fresh-squeezed lemonade or a pint of Mudbone, their exclusively small-batch brewed, handcrafted beer.   Made from all natural ingredients, Crystal hops, and three distinct types of malted barley, Mudbone distinguishes itself from the rest of the pack with a well balanced flavor, smooth body, and crisp finish.  Signature cocktails, such as The Picnicker South Georgia Peach Tea, The Glass 'o Sunshine Margarita, or my personal favorite, The Politic'er County Seat Cosmo will get anyone feeling festive.  The drinks and corn muffins seemed to disappear as quickly as the server could replenish them.  Main dishes include the Full Rack of Hickory Smoked Ribs where meat falls off the bone, Beef Brisket that dances on your taste buds, and a Pulled Pork Sandwich on Sourdough served with a scrumptious side of hand-breaded Onion Rings.  The Bar-B-Q Chicken delicately basted with their classic barbeque sauce is delicious, and serious carnivores will love the succulent Two Meat Combo plate.  Side dishes, called 'trimmings', include Bar-B-Q Baked beans, Creamy Cole Slaw, Mac-the-Cheese, Mashed Potatoes, Big E's Collards, and Fresh Cut Fries, to name a few. You can be sure to hit a winner, no matter what entrée and trimmings you choose.  Everything at Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q is made fresh daily; I've heard they don't even own a freezer!    They meticulously smoke meats slowly overnight through to early morning adding more meat two to three times a day.  They say their motto is, 'low and slow'.  Nothing is cooked the day before or reheated via steaming.  They make their own salad dressings, croutons, and pie shells in-house daily just like grandma.   Once the food was ordered, we sat back supping our drinks and enjoying the warm woods, soft leathers, and exposed brick creating the comfortable, smart-casual atmosphere.  High ceilings allow fans to circulate air rich with mouthwatering aromas from the open kitchen.   Mouthwatering ribs, chicken with their famous Bar-b-q sauce crafted from white vinegar and a little tomato, and a perfectly cooked rib-eye steak from the specials menu, were delivered to our table quickly.  The three-cheese macaroni was a huge hit, and we fought over who got to lick the bowl clean!  We also enjoyed the creamy coleslaw and bar-b-q baked beans.  If the generous portions prove daunting they are more than happy to box up leftovers to enjoy later.   Save room for dessert, as Jim 'N Nick's homemade cream pies are \"to die for.\"  I ordered the Chocolate Cream Pie and my husband had the Banana Cream Pie - his all time favorite!  They also had Pecan and Coconut Cream Pies on the menu that night.  Their pies are made fresh daily and you can't leave without trying one--what a great way to top off an incredible meal.  Owners Troy and Jenne Taylor stopped by our table to ask how everything was.  They are very hands on, even after the arrival of their new baby boy, and can often be seen chatting with customers throughout the day and evening.   They are great people, so be sure to say hello if they are around.    Jim 'N Nick's BAR-B-Q offers a takeout menu, so you can order ahead and use the drive through to pick up your food.  They also provide catered food, so be sure to contact Karen Mikkelson at the restaurant.  Parties can book the large banquet room, or Jim 'N Nick's will cater your next corporate event or private function at your place.  Everyone loves Bar-B-Q!"}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience. Great food, great server, and no long waits. Busy place but overall no complaints. Pricing is fair for quality of product. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A little disappointed - service was great, parking was brutal.  I had the pulled pork, Mac and cheese and fries.  Friends I was with had the ribs.  All in all the meat was a little bland and dry - for the price we expected better.  The Mac and Cheese and the fries were the bomb.  Do not plan to go back, much better places at a better price point near by..."}
{"text":"Great staff.  The bbq aroma in the parking lot luring you inside.  Was disappointed because my ribs were dry & not at all tender or succulent.  They had very little sauce.  I will try it again since this experience didn't live up to the reviews."}
{"text":"the devilled eggs ( have never seen this in a restaurant before)  Wings were very tasty"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!  Clearly the best bbq brisket I have found outside of Kansas City!  Great bbq, sides, cold beer, and wonderful complimentary cheese muffins!  The hostess and waiter were super attentive! 5 stars in my book!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I visited this location because two years ago when I was visiting Concord I went to this restaurant. Two years ago the food was great!!! I was impressed so I decided to visit again. The customer service was lacking. I had a cup of water, the baby back ribs, Mac n cheese and bake beans. My cousin drink was water, some type of sandwich and onion rings. My daughter had fruit punch, she only wanted fries.   My Baby back ribs dry, weren't very tasty, Mac n cheese was warm and stiff as if it had been sitting out, the bake beans tasted ok (warm). My cousin onion rings were awful he didn't eat them. My daughter barely touched her fries (she loves fries).   So the meal wasn't so great but here's the kicker. I'm drinking my water I see something in my ice. Upon closer inspection I see it's a gnat frozen in the ice. I inform our waitress of the frozen gnat. The waitress told the manager he came to our table. The manager seemed puzzled at first as if he was trying to figure out what was in my ice. He then asked if I wanted another drink. I said \"no\". He seemed to think it was funny. I didn't see the humor in finding a gnat frozen in my ice. I don't think I'll be going back to this location. Perhaps it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim as I've been wanting some bbq..first off I've been hearing great things from my neighbors so I wanted to take a chance. My family and I came in after the lunch rush, we were immediately seated. Our server Brandon was attentive. My mom seemed to enjoy her loaded potato with beef. While I got the turkey with Mac n cheese and potato salad. I was pleased with my meal. Shocked not I enjoyed the potato salad. I just randomly picked it not expecting much. It actually taste like how I prepare mine at home. Next time I definitely want to try the beef or the ribs. The biscuits were good too, nice and sweet. Now there's cheese in it. Not sure if they were supposed to be served room temperature as they were not hot or what...I figured with there being cheese it would be hot..anyway in not complaining there were good. So yeah, a great meal and something for everybody. My son who doesn't eat much enjoyed his hamburger, and their fries appear to be fresh cut."}
{"text":"Had a taste for some Bbq so I stopped in. Ordered a combo with Brisket and Smoked Turkey. They offer lots of side but I went with the macaroni and cheese because of the waiters suggestion. Also had a sweet tea to wash it all down. Overall this place has lots of potential but it's just not there yet. The turkey was juicy and delicious. The brisket tasted like I came from 2 different pieces of meat because some pieces were dry and other weren't. The macaroni taste like an experiment. You know those people that decide they're gonna cook thanksgiving dinner for the first time.... Well that same person made this macaroni!!!!! Finally... The tea! The tea  was made by someone's grandmother. It had just the right amount a diabetes!!!!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best BBQ in the Charlotte area. I have a service dog and he gets royal treatment."}
{"text":"Ate here last week and the food and service was excellent. They also catered an event I attended last night and the smoked turkey with Morgan white sauce was out of this world.  Would also recommend their mac n cheese. Can't wait to go back for more of that turkey and sauce!"}
{"text":"Very happy to see these guys open.  We are fans of 521 BBQ, which has the best ribs, but now they have a bit of upscale competition with Jim 'N Nicks just up the road.  We went for lunch and waited about 30 minutes for a table.  It was worth it.  The place is clean and well kept.  Menu is simply great.  They have all the standard southern BBQ items, like pulled pork, ribs, chicken and sausages.  But more with beef brisket as a regular item, along with soups, salads, ham and turkey.  Oh boy!  Everything is fresh, meats and fixings as they call them.  They even have a drive through and the interior eating area is huge with an outdoor seating area for warmer weather times.  There is a private enclosed room available and they do cater.  If you are looking to try bourbons and rye whiskeys this is the place.  There must be at least 20 on the bar menu.  Service is excellent and fast.  We ordered plates and they came quickly with decent portions.  Their \"smoke\" level is a tad strong, but it is flavorful and manageable.  We will become regulars."}
{"text":"Ok bbq. Not a fan of smoked flavor on all the meats. Collards & black eyed peas were good but a bit spicy. Mac & cheese was really good. Sauces were not good either. I def wouldn't choose this place. I'd have to be made to come back.  Our waitress was terrible as well."}
{"text":"Good food/BBQ. Quick service. But is hit or miss on whether or not your server is a likable. Today Bob(?) has been very helpful and I've enjoyed his demeanor.   Yeah, yeah... the cheddar biscuits are delicious!  We've eaten here several times and have enjoyed Karl's fried catfish, some yummy mac & cheese (my wife is a connoisseur of the stuff and she really likes it), I like their baked beans (not too sweet) and collard greens (they are well seasoned). The beer selection is adequate and there's a 22 oz. option on drafts... fun! ;)  But today I discovered a special combination: I tried the hot links for the first time (I had heard good things about them. Getting the $5 small plate for lunch (which is one link served with pimiento cheese and saltines) and eye balling the basket of gratuitous cheddar muffins, I had a classic eureka moment: ditch the saltines - cut the muffins in half and make little openface sliders. The results of this dabbling were great!  My belly is so full and happy. $5!!!"}
{"text":"First timer...20 minute drive thru. Well done burger ordered. Um it was crispy...too much mustard. Pulled pork was cold. Fries were cold. They said it was made to order. What, made to piss me off!!!??? Not happy! This was crap! Don't go, Cookout is third the price, go there!"}
{"text":"Went here with the wife, son and his girlfriend....    Pork BBQ nachos... I will say more, but that already says volumes!!!   Man, what a way to start.  I would never have put this together, but spicy salsa, cheese, jalapenos with delicious pulled pork BBQ, so remarkably good and what a balance!!   Oh, and don't forget the cheesy hot muffins they bring you while you're waiting for your meal.  As for the meal... oh yeah.  They do brisket right!!  The smoke is really identifiable on the meat, and it is so tender each bite is as easy as the last one.  No tearing away, or architectural failures fighting with tough meat here.  I tried both sauces on the table.  I admit it, I am a vinegar man, so went with it.  The sweet BBQ is nice, but just doesn't do the job as far as I am concerned.  The greens were delicious too, I really wish it was a bigger serving , I almost ordered a second helping.   I know we will be back to either this location or their other location on the other side of Charlotte, both are AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe the first time I went, they or I had an off night but they really deserve the 4 stars here.  Their smoke treatment is top notch, and they are more inventive than I gave them a chance for previosuly.  I have now had the pulled pork nachos.. A MUST HAVE!!   These are so good.  Such a surprise that the pork and sauce, with the cheese and jalapenos go so well together.  The staff is always friendly.   Glad I am taking a minute to update to a better way of thinking !!"}
{"text":"Great southern food and absolutely delicious carolina pork. The waiters are nice and service is great. The biscuits they bring at the beginning are absolutely amazing! Sweet tea is a little watery but other than that a great dinning experience. Highly recomended."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was decent. Liked the smoked sausage, the ribs were ok."}
{"text":"I must graciously disagree with many of the reviews here for Jim n Nicks. This is mediocre BBQ at best. The smoke flavoring is good like it has been genuinely and properly smoked, but the quality of the meat is sub par. The sides (Mac and cheese & baked beans) were quite bad. Beans out of a can and heated, and canned cheese sauce over macaroni.   Service was good, manager did good meet and greet at the tables. Not the best food."}
{"text":"Always good.  Fast service.  Also has drive thru for pick up.  Best BBQ around!"}
{"text":"My favorite dine out meal while down in Charlotte last weekend. I couldn't leave NC without having some BBQ. We stopped by Jim & Nicks early before the dinner rush and they gave our party one of the large corner booths. Our server was on the ball with water and and some corn bread from the get go. Then taking our drink and dinner orders.   I went with their Classic Style Chopped Pork BBQ sandwich and it was delicious! Along with that I ordered fresh cut fries and baked beans. After doing the initial tasting I added their Spicy BBQ Sauce to the sandwich and wow did that add some POP to it. The fresh cut fries were delicious and the baked beans were infused with BBQ. Just really really good stuff here! The meal was a home run!  I wish I had picked up a bottle of their Spicy sauce and after taking a look at their website I found that you can buy it online. w00t!   Jim & Nicks Sauces: https://www.jimnnicks.com/store/product/goods/sauce/  All in all an excellent stop for dinner. I can't wait to go again and wish they had a J&N closer to home back here in Norfolk, VA."}
{"text":"If you want Brisket.. this is where it's at!  This is a great alternative to driving to a couple of other places that have amazing BBQ but are a little harder to get to.  Everything here is made from scratch.  That means everything here is good!  Really good!!  All the sides are fresh, the meat is never anything but fall off the bone tender, and the service is top notch.  Jim and Nick obviously know what they're doing!  As a strange side note, this place has the perfect ice.  I'm somewhat of an \"ice expert\", and am always on the lookout for the good stuff.  Crushed, soft ice, pellets, not cubes, are best!  This place has it and they're always happy to give me a cup of ice to go.  (Yes, i'm that fanatical about ice.)"}
{"text":"Great bbq. Love Vinegar based sauce not a lot of places around here make it like that.  I'm super happy to live near here!"}
{"text":"The staff was quite friendly, even though I showed up nearly 45 minutes before the rest of my table. In the meantime, the biscuits were plentiful to the point that I had to take a small box of them home because they kept bringing them even after we got our entrees. The food itself was good and arrived promptly -- in particular, an off-menu sweet potato casserole was only available by circumstance but was entirely delectable. It seems odd they pulled it from the menu, but I hope it makes an eventual return."}
{"text":"Any BBQ place in the south has to be amazing to stay in business. With that said, I don't think this place will last long. Ppl in the area have other options nearby for real good pure BBQ. Jim and Nicks is fast food BBQ and it's not good at all.   We got he family chicken meal with two sides and a dozen cheddar  muffins and added 2 pounds of Ribs. That was over $50 so I was expecting some amazing food. NOT! The ribs and chicken were wet and slimy. Lots of fat on the ribs too and the cuts were off. Southern ribs are dry rubbed smoked and sauce comes on the side. Even Chili's chain knows that.  The sides were hit and miss. Fries were good and plentiful but the MAC and cheese was horrible. They obviously make a roux (butter, flour and milk) for their Mac and cheese base which made the Mac and cheese have a thick paste like consistency. The cheese taste was not present at all.   The baked beans were good and probably the best side but my kids who love baked beans said they didn't taste right. Maybe b/c there was a large collard green leaf on top of the beans when we opened them threw their desire to eat them off. The slaw was not creamy, it was very vinegary which is a preference in the south but regardless of the flavor the cabbage should be crispy and this was soggy.   We will not try this place again. I'd rather go a little further down the road and get some local authenticate low and slow cooked BBQ on 521."}
{"text":"Good to have classic Carolina Vinegar-based barbecue! Got the pulled pork and it was delicious. Didn't even need sauce it was so flavorful although the sauce was very good too. Side of Mac & cheese was also excellent. Start corn muffins were fluffy and addicting. Price was a little steep for BBQ but well worth it. Will return when I'm in the Carolinas!"}
{"text":"Love their cheese muffins and fired short ribs! One of the best in the country in my opinion."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is great as well as the food. But this time not so much. It was one of the worst dining experiences ever. Our waitress completely neglected us the entire time. Our drinks were never filled, I had something spicy so I was pretty much dying. I couldn't see her so I couldn't flag her down to ask for more. Whenever she'd pass us she didn't even look our way. Other ppl were getting their cheddar biscuits before us, multiple times. We had to wait 40 minutes for a freaking salad. A SALAD. Not cool. We were the only black ppl in her section. Maybe that had something to do with it? And to top it all off, she left us with a waitress without even telling us. She had to leave for another job. So we were very confused. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch.  Very friendly staff and the food is amazing.  Definitely need to try the Alabama White Sauce on the turkey lunch plate."}
{"text":"Smiley was a great waitress. Very good sweet tea. Bbq sandwich hit the spot and Mac n cheese was yummy! Can't go wrong for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place rocks. I drove by Jim and Nicks maybe 5 times while visiting family before stopping in for some more NC BBQ. Back home (CT), barbecue joints aren't nearly as ubiquitous so I sampled wherever/whenever I could on this vacation. Pulling into the parking lot and seeing smoke pouring out the stacks is a welcome sign. The vibe was awesome here. Somehow j felt at home as me and my family say for dinner. The ambience was laid back and the wait staff was very welcoming. I ordered the pulled chicken and smoked turkey with a side of mac n cheese. I have a habit of swaying my opinion of an establishment's food in general by how good the mac is. I was impressed here. It was great. So good I was back the next day just for a side of it.  The smoked turkey and pulled chicken was also very good. Lean, no fat, tasty, and the sauce complimented it well. No complaints at all. However, I will say that I think their cheese biscuits are overrated. The combination of both sweet and savory (that usually works for me with other things) didn't quite click here. I tried to like it but ended up with the \"meh\" reaction.  Overall this place was great. The prices are right and everyone else that ate with me enjoyed also. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great customer service! I called on my way home for a pickup order and the manager said he would take our order even though they closed in 5 mins. The food is delicious and we eat there all there time."}
{"text":"My search for the best barbecue places in the Charlotte area continued recently with a visit to Jim 'n Nick's Bar-B-Q in Charlotte, NC.  Jim 'n Nick's has 28 locations in 7 different states and prides itself in cooking its 'que low and slow and making everything from scratch.  I've heard good things regarding Jim 'n Nick's, so I decided to give it a shot.  I confess that I got excited when I parked and saw a nice sized wood pile on one side of the building and a pull-behind smoker on the other side.  Once inside, I place my order.  The server was a touch slow to come over and take my order, especially considering that the restaurant was not busy at all.  I decided on a combination platter with spare ribs, hot links, pulled pork, and chicken.  For my sides, I picked BBQ baked beans and onion rings.  I chose the hot links as one of the meats since they were featured by the restaurant at the Big Apple BBQ Block Party.  I was a little surprised when they brought out cheese biscuits instead of hush puppies to go along with the meal.  However, the biscuits were very tasty.  After a little while, my plate comes out of the kitchen.  Wow, that's a lot of food!   Before digging in, I saw there were 2 different sauces available on the table.  Why yes, I do think I'll try them out.  The original BBQ sauce has a little lighter color than ketchup.  A naked taste tells me that it's not overly sweet and a little bit bold.  The other sauce is the hot habanero sauce.  There is more molasses present in this sauce.  It is a bit sweeter than the original sauce, and it has a good amount of heat.  On to the food...  all of the meats came out pre-sauced.  I usually prefer that it not be sauced, but this is just a personal preference.  The pulled pork was very moist and flavorful.  The sauce worked well with the pork.  However, I could not detect any hints of the meat being smoked.  The chicken was also very tender and moist.  The cut I was given was a bit unusual -- I was given a breast and wing rather than a leg quarter.  Not quite bite-thru skin, but that's okay.  It was still flavorful.  Now on to the hot links...  I could instantly see why they were the featured item.  The sausage was extremely tasty.  Perfectly cooked and just the right amount of heat...  that made for a tasty treat!  The disappointment for me was the ribs.  I could see that they were smoked.  However, they were dry and overdone.  And now to the sides: the BBQ baked beans were adequate.  They contained bits and pieces of pork shoulder.  I would have liked for them to be a little bit more bold.  The onion rings, on the other hand...  WOW!  Those were some fine onion rings.  I could've made a meal on them, mainly because they were so many.  They were very crispy and very large.  Overall, I confess to being a little let down with Jim 'n Nick's Bar-B-Q in Charlotte.  Maybe it's one of those places where the food is much better for dinner than for lunch, and maybe other locations are just better.  Again, some items were excellent (the hot links, for example), but I guess I just had higher expectations -- especially with the ribs.

{"text":"I made my first visit to Jim N' Nicks the other night with my daughter.  When you first walk in you're treated to a nice smoky aroma.  It was fairly crowded for a Tuesday night, but we were seated immediately.  The service was outstanding.  Our server informed us that they didn't have a freezer as everything is fresh.  They were out of ribs at the time and there wouldn't be any ready for another 1.5 hours, but we weren't planning on ordering ribs anyway.    I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and my daughter had the cheese quesadilla with mac and cheese.  The only reason I'm not giving a five star review because the pulled pork was just a little on the dry side for me, but was very flavorful.  The fries were also just a little limp.  Very minor.  Don't let this keep you away.  I also had a taste of the mac and cheese and it was great.  Obviously homemade and not out of a box.  I look forward to visiting again and trying out some different items.  It won't take much for me to bump this review up to a 5 star."}
{"text":"I love Jim 'N Nick's so I am glad I experienced them first in my home town of Charleston. This Jim 'N Nick's customer service was horrible and the food was mediocre. Hostess took so long to sit us the manager had to sit us. Our waitress took extremely long between taking our order and ever other service. The brisket was dry, we had to send our kids drummets back, and the riblets barely had any meat on it. Will never come back to this Jim 'N Nick's."}
{"text":"We came at lunch time on a Friday and only has to wait about 15 minutes. We used that time to check out the menu. We were really hungry. They started us off with their famous cheese biscuits. Slightly sweet they had more of a popover feel/taste to them. More cakey then bread but still good. I ordered the southern fried chicken salad. Very good! The lettuce was shredded the way I like the seeds were taken out of the cucumbers and there was plenty of big chunks of fried chicken. I had it tossed in the vinaigrette and it was just right. For me it needed just a little bit of salt and pepper but that only brought out the flavor a for me. The atmosphere was typical country restaurant and the wait staff was very nice. My husband had the loaded Mac that had shredded pork on top. He loved it! It came with a salad but that lettuce was not shredded. He liked that too. Just like the previous post, it was very rich and cheesy. The price for everything was reasonable and we will come back."}
{"text":"Another good BBQ n bar joints the food is very good and huge selections of alcohol as you would expects, the staff was very friendly to me (I'm a friendly guy) n the price is reasonable in compare to the rest of the BBQ n Bar joints around charlotte area, so yeah I would go back if I'm craving me some good ole BBQ food n a drink to go with it."}
{"text":"The sanitation grade is currently 92.7. I ate here with my family on a Sunday. Cheddar biscuits were served for free as an appetizer. They were okay, but lacked flavor. We enjoyed side salad, smoked wings, ham sandwich, chicken fingers and macaroni and cheese. However, the baked potato was cold and hard, though the toppings were hot which was odd. The riblets were also cold and hard, they did not fall of the bone. The atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Today is my second day ever eating at Jim 'N Nick's BAR-B-Q and it was not as good as I remember...my waitress was nice and sweet but she forget to give use bread , and when she bought it to use we had already gotten our food . When I got my food everything looked great   But my grilled chicken breast sandwich was a little to will done it taste my like charcoal then chicken I wanted to send it back but my waitress didn't return until my aunt was done with her food . I still love Jim 'N Nick's  but I want be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"Worked with Meghan Welter for catering my event and she did a great job!!!!!!  You can't go wrong with Their BBQ and Meghan will take care of all your needs"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad at all. Not outstanding, but definitely not bad. The pulled pork sandwich was satisfying and met my expectations. The server was friendly, the fries were good and crispy, the hot sauce was hot but still had flavor. The place and food just seem overall generic. I dunno that I'd highly recommend this place, or have a burning desire to come back. But if you do eat here, you won't be super disappointed. Just not blown away, either."}
{"text":"Sat us in what seemed to be a clean booth, but was filthy from the floor to the cushions. Our waiter barely went the mile, let alone the extra mile. Didn't ask if we wanted cold glasses with our beer, etc. The place wasn't busy, but he was busy doing nothing. Food was less than desirable. Had the nachos (bland and salty), Pork Quesadilla (make ya gag), but the onion rings were tasty. Won't be returning in this lifetime..."}
{"text":"Pretty good bbq. The pulled pork was good and the sides were great. The beans and potato salad were very tasty. The cheese muffins and honey butter are the best. Great little place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!I love the whole chicken dinner. My family is so excited when I say Im hitting their drive-thru. The restaurant is great too."}
{"text":"We did the NASCAR experience and intended to head to Lexington for bbq but we ran out of time so we hit this place in concord. The waitress was great the food was incredible. We did the deluxe order and got everything on the menu. Amazing Carolina bbq and it was nice to see some brisket and turkey in the mix. Great location! Recommended to anyone in the area. Nothing we ate was bad or even close to bad. Love it!"}
{"text":"First off, I must note that this is a chain restaurant based out of Alabama.  If you're looking for a real local Carolina BBQ joint, this is not the place you want to look.  That said, they do have good food and the service is generally good as well.  If we didn't live so close to this place we would not go out of our way to get there.  If your goal is to get some good Carolina BBQ and you know your Carolina BBQ, go elsewhere.  But if you aren't turned off by the fact that it's a chain then it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Firstly why don't more restaurants have a drive thru?  After a long day at work sometimes i just wanna roll up to a window and order my food - but don't want fast food.  Enter Jim and Nicks.  Yes evidently this place is a chain, but you know what....I really like it despite the chain status.  It isn't cheap, My dinner regularly is over the $20 mark for one person, but it's good food.  I've been to the drive up window probably 7 or 8 times.  The servers are always nice and helpful,  sometimes you have a bit of a wait, but never intolerable.    OK - onto the food.  It's good.  The collards are my fav, and the mac n cheese is awesome.  I usually stick to either brisket or bbq pork.  The protein servings are also generous.  I can split a brisket portion into two dinners actually.  Try the lemon pie.  It's divine.  The crust is awesome.  I can also split that up into two servings if I'm not feeling too piggy.  I did take one star off b/c one of my first visits they forgot my pie.  So I got home, unpacked my dinner and saw no pie.  I called to complain, they were very apologetic, but said they could not credit me unless I came back in.  I declined - I mean I just wanted to get into my comfy clothes and eat some BBQ."}
{"text":"Tried Jim 'n Nicks for the first time. Excellent pork ribs and beef brisket.  Must try for anyone into BBQ. Very focused on customer service and making sure their customers have a positive experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to enjoy BBQ. Not a wild spread chain so it has a nice regular vibe and the barbecue is amazing. Definitely recommend to someone who is new and old to barbecue. Really good place for lunch, groups and families. Been on a few dates here and I loved them all no matter how awkward they were. The biscuits are awesome!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!!! Every single item I ate was the best that I'd ever had.  Everything was scratch made and delish!!  Being gluten free and being able to confidently consume the sauces because the chef who actually makes everything is there, was a treat. I can't wait to return AND EAT MORE :)"}
{"text":"Great food, better customer service. The BBQ is on par with the best I've had in Charlotte and every staff person I met was so friendly and helpful. I don't know what else to say accept they made me feel like they care and the food was so good! There was an error with my order - they took care of me so well. Everything I had was delicious (BBQ, Brisket, Mashed Potatoes w/Gravy, Onion Rings - for the record). As the terminator says \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ and service!  My whole family enjoyed it.  Best we found in the Charlotte area so far."}
{"text":"First time visit.....  enjoyed their little cheese biscuits .... Had the ribs,beef brisket,mashed taters with gravy, Mac and cheese was goooood. Very cheesy and creamy just how I like it and collard greens had a smoky taste to it, wonderful...."}
{"text":"We've been here tons of times. The brisket sandwich is so good, so are the ribs, fried chicken, mashed potatoes. The sweet biscuits are amazing. Great prices and service as well."}
{"text":"Come on Jim!  Maybe it's because I got take out.  I ordered the smallest baby back ribs but what I got was smaller than anything I imagined could be a possibility.  I had 4 pockets of meat between 5 ribs.  The mash potatos were average with a great peppery gravy.  The mac n cheese had a solid layer of cheese on it.  This could have been due to the pickup but it wasn't ready when I got there so that isn't a great excuse.  For those ocra lovers out there, like myself, this place stands out in that it actually doesn't carry it.  The best part of the meal was definitely the 2 tiny cheese biscuits.  All in all when I opened the container at home and realized I had spent $13 on basically just sides I wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"BBQ! I came here recently-ish (because my procrastination of writing reviews) with a date, and she recommended it. Not a bad recommendation may I add? I think I did the wrong thing to start off with though. Even though I must have to say, not trying to be cocky and all, but my picture of my dish looks pretty appetizing as I look back on it now.  So, walking in the feeling I got was that it was a very country-esque...like a country bar or something like that with the country music blasting out in the corner etc. And well, of course as a yelper I rolled with it. As long as they served good BBQ. I have to say though it was alright for me, it was partially my fault though.  I ordered the Fried Chicken with Gravy with a side of Fried Green Tomatoes. And well the results of what I ordered? Not really amazing. Honestly, I asked the waitress what the best dish of the restaurant was in her opinion. Something that defines the restaurant... and well she gave me the popular decisions and choices customers made and came back to eat it.  In my opinion, I felt like it wasn't the right dish that I picked out of the choices. Of course, a souther staple, Fried Chicken has always been ruled in the south. However, this one to me wasn't it. In my opinion I felt like there was just way too much salt and it was dominated in the chicken. The gravy was a nice touch but it just didn't have enough of it to combat the saltiness of the chicken.   Fried Green Tomatoes? The side was alright, the breading sort of just slid off and didn't really stay on the tomatoes. Which I guess is tricky. I didn't really finish the tomatoes as it got soggy and didn't have any taste.  Service wise, as you could tell my waitress was extremely nice. She was helpful and told me the ins and outs of the place. Sometimes the first time at a restaurant it's helpful to see what the restaurant is known for, and I do this frequently.   Overall, Jim 'n Nick's wasn't bad! Particularly since my waiter was amazing in helping me choose. Unfortunately, I chose wrong, but I didn't know that it wasn't going to be hard to eat. I'll defintely be back if I get the chance and try out some other BBQ dishes, just not the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Those nachos... Are pretty awesome. Peach Sweet Tea? Yes, please. I heard there was this great BBQ spot, and I decided to try it out! And the verdict? Tasty. Especially for a chain. I mean, come on...where can you find Peach Sweet Tea? That's virtually unheard of unless you're drinking it out of a can.   We ordered the nachos and I ate off other people's plate because, well I was already stuffed when coming here. I still got a taste of what flavors Jim 'N Nick's was offering. What I found was that it wasn't bad at all. It was tasty and tender.   Overall verdict, definitely a place to try out. Especially if you feel more safe as far as going to a chain. Next time I will be sure to order more and definitely get a Peach Sweet Tea to go!"}
{"text":"Tried the food here only because I had a gift card and got the ribs and pulled chicken meals. I have to say, I'm utterly shocked at how horrible the food is since bbq is so difficult to mess up. With all the raving reviews, I'm very disappointed at the fact there is no flavor and is very overpriced. Chicken, no flavor.  Mashed potatoes have no gravy - what do you eat it with then?  Mac and cheese taste like powdered cheese from a box.  Ribs were small and semi dry. Sauces are very processed. And the recommended \"white sauce\" that everyone goes for -- what is that exactly? You can't substitute a bbq \"red\" sauce to any kind of bbq white sauce. Doesn't happen. Will never go back and waste hard earned money here."}
{"text":"This place is dangerously close to our new house which means I will have to rein it in on my addiction to kitchen sink nachoes.  We first tried this place a few months ago and have been back multiple times.  The atmosphere is great, they have their own brand of beer and the food is very good!  The little cornbread cheesy muffins they bring out before your meal are very addicting and before you know it you have gobbled down 3 before your dinner arrives....whoops!  Kitchen Sink Nachoes are my favorite, they are nachoes with queso (liquid cheese for those not in the know, it is a requirement of my husband's for all acceptable nachoes) pulled pork! more shredded cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, and BBQ sauce.  I don't know how you could possibly go wrong!  I've also had the chicken club sandwich, a burger, and pulled pork.  I tend to shy away from large platters of meat so I stick to a sandwich.  The potato salad is great and the collard greens are wonderful as well.  Lots of parking and pretty reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"First time here. We were very impressed with everything we ate. We ordered the family meal. Delicious variety of meats. The side dishes were amazing . The muffins before the meal are addicting.   Tried three of their pies to share. Tasty and good quality homemade. Great service to boot   We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and the service is friendly and fast. We have actually been here a few times and the food hasn't disappointed us yet. We have gotten something different each time too so we have explored the menu a bit."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the bar-b-q here.  You can smell the smoker working its magic as soon as you enter the restaurant. The star of the show is the meats!  The smoked ham is good too!  They do ribs well, brisket well, and pulled pork well!  I usually get the smoked turkey breast with the montgomery county white sauce.  The turkey is always moist, juicy, and delicious.  The sauce is creamy, slightly vinegary, a little spicy, and peppery.  Love it!     While your waiting for your order, they serve up some of the most incredible cheddar muffins.  Fresh from the oven, and the cheese is gooey in the middle.  Don't eat too many though!  Also, be sure to save room for dessert, the pies here are awesome!  Chocolate pie, peanut butter pie!!    They're really flexible when ordering sides.  I just wish the portion were slightly larger especially for the potato salad.  And they rotate side items daily.  How about fried okra?   Bottom Line - they do bar-b-q very well here!  They mix a lot of regional specialties from Carolina pulled pork, to Texas brisket, to Memphis style ribs, to Kansas City style meats here.  They also mix up some good bar-b-q sauces.  One of my favs!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this location. Have been to several others of theirs and this one does not compare. Server was very nice but food was very below par. We ordered the wings but they were very small and bland. Sandwich was extremely small and dry. Tried to order dessert but they were out of bananas."}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru to order the family picnic. We got the pulled pork, biscuits, fries, Mac n cheese, and buns. The BBQ sauce that came with it was delicious. A slight kick and a bit of tangy. The biscuits were addicting. Soft and moist, they can be a meal by itself. I'm not typically a pulled pork person but it was juicy and flavorful. Not dry at all. Fries were not desirable. Mac and cheese was certainly cheese, the way I like it.   Next time I go, I'll get a different side other than fries."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday evening after running around all looking at new furniture. I decided to give it a try. My first thought the service was great. The waitess was outstanding. Well here is when things go downhill. I tried the doubledecker sandwich which is a sandwich with pork on the bottom and beff brisket on top. The meat was ok the bar-b-que sauce was just ok. The fries were cold stuck together. I have had better. Will I go back probably not. But again I think the staff was great."}
{"text":"Biscuits were money, baby's were good. Hot sausage appetizer is a winner and you'll be surprised by the turkey. Brisket was ok."}
{"text":"It has been a very long time since I've been here. Mostly because I moved to Florida. But it you want excellent BBQ you have to give this place a try. The only disappointment was that they sent our server home early because it wasn't very busy. But if you want the best service from the best server ask to sit in Sierra's table. You wouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In town for the races and found this wonderful venue. My spare ribs were heavenly  and my wife had the loaded potato that seriously was big enough for 2 as a meal or 3 as a side.  Service was prompt and friendly in the most genuine way."}
{"text":"Ok barbecue but I love their cheese muffins. Fast service though even they are always busy"}
{"text":"Delicious Bar b q. Hilarious waitress who was straightforward, but clearly polite and great at her job. Highly recommend the pulled pork. Home cut fries are a must as a side. Whatever seasoning they put on there is addicting."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Charlotte for a concert and stopped at Jim n Nick's to try some BBQ. Overall, quick service and good food! I will go back when I'm in town again.  We went before the dinner rush, so we were quickly seated and our server got us our drinks shortly after. We got the Deviled Eggs (3 pc) DELICIOUS!! We didn't wait to over eat before the concert, so we shared a Half Baby Back Ribs with fries & colesaw. We were in and out of the restaurant within 30 minutes! Great efficiency and food! :)"}
{"text":"I should start by prefacing that I'm a stickler about BBQ and BBQ restaurants. I had lunch here today and it was very disappointing, mainly the food. Right off the bat you don't get any sweet smell of meats being smoked outside or inside of the resturant. That's usually a red flag that this might not be the real deal.   So, I check out the lunch menu and it doesn't look pleasing, so I ordered the combo plate off the main menu. Brisket, Turkey breast, baked beans, and coleslaw. Here are the Pros and Cons cons:  Cons: 1.The Brisket--This is my main issue. This along with the turkey breast came on the plate with sauce on it!--cardinal sin. I asked the waitress to include some burnt ends--non existent.  The brisket was served in one big lump, no slices. It had the consistency and taste of a beef roast-not even close to how brisket is suppose to be prepared. On top of that, it tasted like it was boiled and then maybe, maybe smoked for an hour afterward.   2. No hint of any rub being used.  3. Very little smoke flavor.   4. $22 lunch w/tea and small portions.   Pros: 1.Turkey was moist. 2. Sides were decent.  3. Staff has friendly"}
{"text":"I ordered the 4 meats so a friend and I could sample the different BBQ. When the food arrived, it came with BBQ sauce already on the meat even though we didn't order that way. The meat was room temp when it came out to us. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We have visited 48 stars & are always searching for that\"We have to come back\" place. This is it! The food is phenomenal: from the pig salad to the quesadilla, to the ribs, to the mac 'n cheese. Topper was dessert-lemon ice pie & banana pudding. Could have made a meal out of the cheese biscuits. Moreover the service is great; folks who work there are happy. Kudos to Management. Could you please bring your Place to Idaho?!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food is decent. They could drive more business by lowering there plate prices a couple of dollars each."}
{"text":"YUM! I ordered a salad and it was better than I could have imagined. The service was very good and the food was exactly what you'd expect from a BBQ place. The sides were great and the place is very well laid out. It was crowded like a chain restaurant but it had better quality food."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Texas, I have a pretty high bar when it comes to BBQ. Other than 521 BBQ and Macs Speed Shop, I have not found many BBQ restaurants in North Carolina that actually meet my standards. Sadly Jim and Nicks did little to change that.   The atmosphere is typical for a chain restaurant...nothing special, but comfortable.  The bar area is small, but adequate. Good section of local draft beers.  Our table was tight and close to the kitchen.  One of the highlights of our meal was the warm cheddar biscuits. They were wonderful and nice to snack on while waiting for you dinner.   We ordered the baby back ribs, hot links and brisket. For sides we had hand cut fries, beans, mac and cheese and potato salad.  All were good, but none was was great.   The baby backs were excellent. Meaty, tender and perfectly smoked. The pork hot links pretty good, and had a spicy kick. The brisket was a BIG BIG disappointment. The menu stated they smoked their brisket for 12 hours. Well that explained why it was closer to rubber than tender meat. Most master smokers will leave brisket in the pit for 18-24 hours to properly breakdown the membrane that results in a \"melt in your mouth\" heavenly treat.  Jim and Nicks brisket misses the mark. The brisket was chewy, lacked flavor and ranks at the top of the  worse brisket I have ever had.   All and all I was disappointed with this place.  That said I will return and give their pulled pork a try."}
{"text":"Was pretty disapointed. Brisket was so dry barely ediblel, fries for OK, onion rings are good and burgers are really good. Would come back for the burger and onion rings."}
{"text":"It's like being at a friends house for a bbq... Assuming of course that friend knows what the heck they're doing around a smoker.  Spectacular meal and very nice experience."}
{"text":"We were in town for business and the company we visited recommend this place, so we took their suggestion and came here for lunch. Oh my, those cheese muffins are so delicious. I couldn't resist! The sweet tea is really good too! I had the double decker, which has pull pork and brisket in it. It was nice and tender. The BBQ sauce was ok. I didn't know about the spicy kind, otherwise I would've ask for it. It wasn't on the table. . Overall, it was a good BBQ lunch."}
{"text":"Dined here on 6/7/14. They don't take reservations but you can call ahead.  We were a party of 12 and called in advance. At 7 pm the restaurant seemed full. They were prepared for our large party and I don't think we waited more than 5 minutes.  So we started out on a high note and it continued.  They had two servers assigned to our party so ordering went quickly and our drinks came in a very timely fashion. They bring to the tables baskets of freshly made, served hot, cheese biscuits (although they were more like muffins). I didn't care that much for them, but everyone else seemed to like them. Our entrees came out relatively quickly -- orders of ribs, brisket, bbq nachos, pork and various side orders were excellent. Our drinks were continuously refilled and when it came time for the check our servers asked how we'd like them divided and gladly provided six separate checks.  A totally fine experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  We've eaten at the Steele Creek location and liked it so we decided to try this location.  It's also more convenient to our home.    Service was good and quick.  Muffins were good as usual but not warm.  I ordered the Pig in the Garden Salad.  A nice sized salad with a scoop of Pulled Pork in the middle.  I liked the chopped almonds, added a nice touch.  The pork was good, lightly smoked and had a few crispy parts.  No fat, which was good.  My husband ordered the Baby Back Ribs with fries and mac and cheese.  He said the ribs were tough and dry.  He managed his way through them but did not enjoy them at all.  He even let me try a bite and yes, they were very tough and hard to get off the bone.  He doesn't like to complain, so he didn't say anything.  Although, I thought he should have just informed them.  Not even to get them taken off the bill but just to let the Pitt master know that there's a bad batch of ribs being served.   He did say the fries and the mac and cheese were really good.  So... that was  the highlight of his meal."}
{"text":"Outstanding! That is all! Apparently my review needed to be longer. Everything is fantastic! I recommend any of the combo plates and basically everything on the menu is spot on!!!!! Food is fresh, comes out exactly as it should and the service has always been excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. We really like the barbecue and brisket. The green beans and Mac and cheese are a must! Sometimes the service is a little off, but the unlimited cheese muffins make up for it."}
{"text":"Great chain BBQ spot....friendly service and plenty to choose from complete with complimentary cheese biscuits!  This spot is actually bigger inside than it seems and would be very accommodating for a large group. There's also a decent-sized bar with seating in case you're not in the mood for full table service. And in case you're not in the mood for seating at all, you can actually pull up to their drive-thru and place an order to-go!  There's large BBQ plates, sandwiches, salads, ribs, and their famous stuffed baked potatoes. For this visit, I went with the Carolina-style pork sandwich and fries. Once my sandwich came out, I drenched in one of their vinegary based sauces that are provided on each table. FYI, the Carolina pork is a little more on the spicy side which I liked very much. The fries were good but not memorable.  I've eaten at the Steele Creek location and was pleased to see this location pop up since it's closer to my 'hood. In my opinion, this is definitely a much better dining option in the Concord Mills area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, now making it  a regular restaurant that we go to. Pick up some of their muffin mix, it is very good"}
{"text":"I don't usually love a chain, but the fella and I had been intrigued by Jim 'n Nick's since it opened, and we finally made it there on a Wednesday night.  We realized we should've sat on the bar side since the restaurant side was full of screaming kids and felt like a Shoney's/Sonny's, which is fine, but I think we were both thinking it was more comparable to Mac's.  Not so much.  Our waitress was nice but slow and kept complaining about how needy her other tables were and how tired she was.  Have I mentioned I HATE when servers complain to me while they're waiting on me?  'Cause I do.  I have to agree with everyone else about the sweet cheesy biscuits they bring out before the meal; I finally had to put the fella's dirty napkin over the basket to keep from eating every. single. one.    I got the Hickory-Grilled Chicken Breast Plate with baked beans and cinnamon apples, but they were out of apples, so I went with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was juicy and a little too salty; the beans started off sweet and turned spicy (yum); and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from scratch.    The fella was underwhelmed with their beer selection compared to Mac's, but he went back and forth on whether their pulled pork sandwich beat Mac's.  He wasn't a fan of the sauce coming on the sandwich, but he got over it... and he said J&N's collards beat Mac's hands down.  If we go back, we'll definitely opt for the quieter bar side, and the fella will probably try their bourbon selection instead of their beer."}
{"text":"More than just barbecue would be the best title for this review. I wanted to have some time to dine there more than once.  I have to say I am very happy at the many selections on the menu. They are delicious ! I have to say that the ribs and the pulled pork are my favorites. The ribs are fall off the bone tender and moist. The pulled pork is flavorful and full of flavor. No sauce needed. It tastes that good. I was raised on Collard greens. These were moist, they had flavor and just a touch of spice to give it that wonderful flavor.  Of all the sides that are offered they are my favorite. I have had their chicken tenders. These are not the mass produced frozen wonders. These are hand breaded ,tender moist and delicious . You have a choice of dipping sauces. My favorite is the honey mustard followed  closely by the barbecue sauce.  I had the grilled chicken platter today. Two huge chicken breast seasoned simply with salt and pepper. They were then grilled and perfectly cooked. They arrived to our table still sizzling from the grill. I had the slaw as my side. House made, creamy and seasoned just right to compliment my delectable entree.  The restaurant is clean  , the staff team up to turn around a table after the patron has left.  I saw no dust, or areas that needed to be re wiped.  I will ask someone to re wipe a table in a heart beat. (You should too.)  The staff was attentive and kept our drinks full. They are always welcoming and happily answer any questions about the menu. They have a good selection of craft beers available and a nicely stocked bar too. This was a nice addition to the Indian Land area. Easy for those of us across the border in NC to go across the border for a great lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Exceptionally mediocre. Chopped pork was ok. Sides were not noteworthy. Waitress kept apologizing for \"working on my beer,\" which she delivered after the food. I guess I'm accustomed to excellent local cuisine in Asheville."}
{"text":"The hostess and our waitress were super nice. Trying to get another waitress to flag our waitress down was harder than wrangling cats. The sauce was so so on the pork. Basically pepper and ketchup. The potato salad was below average. The giant pulled pork potato was DRY and flavorless. Definitely not worth the price or the drive."}
{"text":"Fairly priced, delicious ribs, generous portions, fun atmosphere, good service, great beer, yummy sides--What's not to like???"}
{"text":"[southern accent]Feller Yelpers,  I had the esteemed pleasure of visiting this joint while on a business trip to the banking (bailed out) capital of the south, Charlotte.  This was a lunch outing with some of my colleagues.  We decided to take a right turn somewhere amid warehouse world (this is how I affectionately called Charlotte's Industrial park at Westinghouse Blvd) ending up at Jim and Nick's.  This looked like a decent enough lunch spot from the outside and the parking lot was packed, this is always a good sign.  I always figure that a restaurant with an empty parking lot is either closed or people had such bad food that they left in a hurry to take care of business, i.e., north brown and south brown.    Walking into the place I was immediately reminded of a generic BBQ spot that is trying too hard to be a sports bar.  It fails miserably at this attempt since the amount of TV's per capita is shameful.  I counted a total of 5 TVs.  They weren't big screens either! Blasphemy.  We were sat in a corner booth and I must say our service was subpar.  The food was brought out on time and it tasted good.  However, considering we were on a rather tight schedule, for this was a lunch break, the server could have been quicker and more attentive.  I think not one of our glasses of water was refilled.  I didn't know Charlotte was located near a desert which explains the reason for the conservation of water experienced at Jim and Nick's.  Although, I think it was related to bad service because if my public school Geography class lessons serve me right, the US is the only country in the world with an advanced civilization and freedom.  Oh, and there are no deserts in the southeast except for foreclosed suburbia.  They served a basket of biscuits (see my photos) that were as greasy as a shell rapid lube attendant's slicked back hair.  Not only were they greasy, they were filled with cheese and had a sweet kick to them.  They weren't bad until I had to have my aorta flushed so that my heart could continue to beat after first bite.    I ordered myself the beef brisket with baked beans and a side of the vegetable of the day (see my photo).  I was trying to be healthy with my veggie choice until I saw that the day's choice was butter with a side of corn on the cob.  I can't believe (no pun intended) how much butter was on it.  I have not seen so much butter in my life since the nationally syndicated Fabio commercials.  I miss them.  There was a reservoir akin to the Hoover Damn one of butter under the corn.  I still enjoyed it though.  I was a bit self conscious of going at it full speed since projectile butter kept being shot at my co workers from where I bit into the corn each time.  After some expletives, I gave up and saved my cholesterol the heart ache, see what I did here?  Overall, go here for some quick grubs during lunch time.  Other than this occasion, I wouldn't go here.  The food is good and the atmosphere is bland.  See y'all.[/southern accent]"}
{"text":"Carolinians, you no longer have to go to Charleston for your Jim N Nick's bbq.  Cost to worth it ratio: 3  Eve award: best cheese biscuits--move over Red Lobster  Highlights: - Cheese biscuits: more like a muffin actually--soft, fluffy, cheesy, with a bit if sweetness and complete with a crunchy outer layer. You need at least a few baskets of this when you're here--the rest is just filler. - Pig salad: not just iceberg but romaine and spinach as well topped with the mother size of all croutons, plenty of shredded cheddar, charred meaty bacon, succulent grape tomatoes, and my favorite clincher: almond slices. You have a choice of meat and beef brisket is always mine. Solid salad. - Beef brisket: my fave is still in Texas, but this is pretty good outside of that. Thick but tender pieces with inherent flavor. Not quite cuttable with just a fork, but close. - Drinks: they have a full bar and impressive beer and wine list. I don't expect great wines at places like this but they touted glasses of honig sauvignon blanc and seghezio zinfandel. Also they make great cocktails with fresh squeezed juices. I had a peach tea which used their lemonade and even though it was on the sweet side, it was great. Big score for a casual spot with great food and drinks! - Atmosphere: Open, comfy, roomy, and woody. Love the booths against the wall. - Service: fast, friendly, and attentive.  Midlight: - Bbq sauce: I like a buffet if options and you get 2 choices here. Regular was tomato based but a bit too light and vinegary for me. I was a bit scared off by the habenero, but I prefered this sauce, as it was a darker mollasses-like color and didn't have an unmanageable kick.  Lowlights: - For some reason I think it tasted better in Charleston where I was completely blown away, but don't get me wrong--it's good stuff.  Excited to have this location relatively c"}
{"text":"I've dined in twice and carried out once. The first time I ate in, the service was atrocious. I mean our waiter was very friendly, but it took forever to get anything if it didn't get forgotten. The 2nd time was for lunch when they weren't quite as busy but it was still super slow. Finally, I made a pick up order which is probably what I will do from now on. I could tell while waiting for my food this time that the whole place is just not run efficiently. There was a lady on the phone at the bar, in my way of picking up, making phone calls about catering. She had her binders and paperwork all over the bar, along with her salad, spilling over into the space of the patron beside her. Do they not have an office to conduct such business?   The bottom line is that the meat, specifically the brisket, is phenomenal, so I will bear the service. The cheese biscuits are beyond delicious and they sides are nothing to write home about. So just order a pound of brisket or bbq or whatever meats, a dozen cheese biscuits, and make some sides at home. The riblet appetizer was also great."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out this new location because we had a great experience in South Carolina. So we went on a Sunday at 6:30pm and very few people in place. Was seated and waited for server and waited then waited some more after 13 minutes got up and spoke with hostess. Got drink order placed and manager came by and apologized he also noticed the wrong cap was on BBQ bottle. Let me get the right cap (he took the sauce). He came back with hot corn bread and again apologizing. So we waited and waited for food. Wow food arrived for 3 of us at 7:20pm. My wife got her meal a few minutes later.  Now we're ready to eat.... no Manager never brought back BBQ sauce.  We finished at 8pm and took 10 minutes to pay bill. Food ok fatty ribs."}
{"text":"The spare ribs is kinda salty. Corn bread and lemonade are so great. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"We got Jim and Nick's to go and each had a BBQ sandwich. My meal was good (I chose the Mac and cheese as my side) and the lemonade was delicious, however my husband found a large piece of paper waded up within the meat of his sandwich :( So he threw the rest of his meal out. I only gave a second star since my meal was good and I appreciated the hearty portions. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Best service! Best BBQ! Amazing staff and sooo attentive! We had the baby back ribs, Mac n cheese, collards, pulled chicken, fries, fried green tomatoes and the best fresh lemonade ever. Oooohhhhh and the cheese biscuits were my life! I wish I would have taken some to go! Make sure you eat them warm, soooo tasty, but great either way!!,Hands down one of the best bbq restaurants we have eaten at. Our next visit to Concord, NC will definitely include a stop here! Tika was our waitress and she was not only amazing but so funny! Thanks for some great southern bbq Concord!"}
{"text":"Know them from my roots in Birmingham.  Was concerned that expansion would detract from the quality at the original, but we were pleasantly surprised.  SO MUCH SMOKE that it's a challenge to wash it off off of your hands!  A WAY GOOD THING that is SO RARE.  My only choice in \"Q\" is always pulled pork (outside/bark) and theirs is excellent, and true to their original location in Birmingham.  A \"keeper\" reminiscent of their first success!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten at your location since you arrived in the Concord area.   I will never eat there again.   Your mgr Matt,  hung out at the bar socializing never to check on the the guests on the floor.  When he finally decided to come to out table,  he no concern or care about our experience.   He continued like a robot giving us a book answer over and over and never let us speak.   Never had a problem with any other mgr or staff.   I will never return because of this mgr. They need to keep him in the back where he does not need to interact with the public."}
{"text":"This place is a chain, and feels like a chain, but they do a great job.  Training of service staff is excellent, and you can tell they run a tight ship.  Food comes out FAST.  And it's very good.  It's a bright, lively atmosphere with lots of happy, helpful staff.  The yummy cornbread-cake-cheddar muffins are so good.  I like everything I've had there to date.  Favorites are tacos and massive potatoes loaded with your choice of meat and all the usual amazing baked potato toppings.   The place is loud and it's a family joint, so expect big tables and lots of kids.  We found the best place for folks sans kids is at the bar or a bar area booth, maybe.  They have a separated area for groups, too."}
{"text":"I was recently in NC checking out the area as I am possibly moving down there this upcoming year.  I am currently in NY this place had excellent Food and Service.  Babyback Ribs, Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans and southern burger were EXCELLENT!  If you live nearby this place is a great place to go with the family!  If you don't live nearby this is a great place to get some GREAT southern style BBQ!"}
{"text":"Stopped to have lunch here on our way to the Charlotte Airport based on the Yelp reviews. Great lunch! The catfish & ribs were amazing!! Excellent service and our waitress gave us great suggestions. The mac & cheese was more cheese than mac and it was amazing. Collard greens were as good as mine. I don't hand out food compliments easily since I'm passionate and good cook. BBQ sauce..yum, yum:)   It was our last lunch in NC before heading back to California and it was amazing."}
{"text":"We brought our family from NY, who were visiting for holidays, to Jim-n-Nicks BBQ. This was our first time here and we all absolutely loved this place! Excellent bbq. All our different meat dishes were served with the meat being moist and not dry or leathery. Portion sizes were KING SIZED. I can eat and this was the first place I ate where I just couldn't finish the portions because of the amount they served. In fact, everyone took home leftovers. The service staff was attentive and the most important thing was that the manager came around after our meal to inquire about our experience.  The atmosphere was great with ample seating and a few big screen televisions mounted strategically. The food here is excellent. Highly recommended and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"All of there side items are Excellent. Everyone that I take here love it. I did have their ribs and I thought they were ok. There fried green tomates are the BEST I have taste. Mac/Cheese, Potatoe Salad and Collard taste excellent. A bit pricy but the amount they give you is good."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ at a good price for the quality of food. Drinks were well priced and very good. Wait staff was kind and prompt and did a great job overall."}
{"text":"The food was awesome,  really,  really good. I had the pulled pork sandwich,  mac & cheese, OMG the cheese biscuits,  collards yum!"}
{"text":"This was a first visit for us and we left very full however more to be desired in terms of customer service. We were quickly greeted upon arrival, seated, and then waited longer than we should have to be greeted by a server and for our drink order to be taken. It was Saturday, late afternoon, and did not appear to busy. I think what made this a \"bad\" experience was another table was seated after us and they were basically at the point where another waitress was taking their orders and we still did not have our drink orders taken. Someone came over and asked if anyone had come over yet and he was not our waiter. The lady that was our waitress was flippant, hurried, and did not appear pleasant. The food was good. I ordered the 2 meat platter spare ribs (great portion size) and smoked chicken. The sides were also very tasty. If you like potato salad, I encourage you to give them a try! The lemonade was also very good...not to tart and not to sweet, just right! Also the cheese corn muffins were delicious! I will return for the aforementioned but will probably go through the drive thru!"}
{"text":"I think another reviewer said it best when they stated this was the Applebee's of BBQ. It wasn't bad but definitely didn't live up to any hype and especially didn't meet the standards for good NC BBQ. Portions were small and overpriced. Jumbo wings couldn't have possibly been smaller. BBQ sauce was not eastern style NC sauce as stated. The sides were nothing you couldn't pick up at the local Publix. Maybe I went in with too high of an expectation for good BBQ but I definitely left disappointed. There are at least 5 restaurants within view from this parking lot that I would rate higher, so my advice, if you find yourself here, would be to take a look around you and reconsider your options."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my cousin who lives nearby when she suggested we go to this place. Upon walking in I was greeted by a not-so-nice hostess. I don't think I ever caught her name but she had two nose piercings and long black hair. Some time after seating us, the same hostess I described then picked a fight with a waitress saying \"if she had a problem they could take it outside\" lol. So I said to my cousin \"is this a joke?\" and she said nope, don't think so. We were one of staring at her when the hostess turned around and said \"what are you looking at?\". UNBELIEVABLE. That hostess or whatever she was was extremely rude and unprofessional, and had just a nasty attitude, enough to make my cousin not want to bring anyone in again. Our server however somewhat made up for it. His name was Anthony and he brought our food out quickly and with a smile, he was a great server. I give this place two stars because while my food was excellent, the attitude displayed by whatever her name was, was just terrible."}
{"text":"Delicious cornbread muffins, absolutely to die for! Perfect ribs! Amazing pie for desserts. Love this place. AND THEY HAVE A DRIVE THROUGH!"}
{"text":"We had to wait for a place to park because they were SOOO busy. It was worth the wait because the food was so good. It was kinda noisy because of so many people. The food was great along with the service."}
{"text":"In Charlotte there are several options for BBQ.  This is one of the good ones.  Beware that your eyes will be bigger than your stomach due to how good everyone else's food looks and smells while you are waiting to order.  The bread was great.  The meat was a little dry, but the sauce makes up for that!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  My mother did too.  My meal was delish and I really enjoyed speaking with the staff.  If you want the beef tips come early, they sell out; which is understandable since everything is made fresh!"}
{"text":"We ate here last weekend and had one of the best servers I've ever had in my life. I forgot to write the review when we left and now I have forgotten her name. She was a shorter, brunette with two first names & the cutest southern twang. She was so friendly, bubbly & happy that it was contagious. Our food was delicious and the little cornbread biscuits are to die for. Highly recommend the beef brisket, smoked chicken and mac & cheese. Delicious southern food!"}
{"text":"Good food but the noise level is always very loud here and at the restaurant in Swannee, GA."}
{"text":"Went to the new Jim & Nicks on Charlotte Highway in Indian land SC Had the brisket was only OK Place very crowed and noisy Staff was OK Found the brisket in City Bar-B-Q up the road by Publix by Providence Road West was much better     11/17 5 stars todsy Went back for lunch today  Had a very small problem with my order and the  bartender and manager took care of it right away in a very professional manner I was very impressed and recommend this place as a very good Restsurant  Will go back as often as possible"}
{"text":"the only food i can review are  the spare ribs and muffins ,  Muffins get a star, sweet and yummy, the ribs do not get a star. The ribs- Bad texture, not very good flavor, way too much fat. I did like the sauce that came with them , it was take out so I dont know if they offer more than one because they just included that one. The server was very nice and gave a sample of the muffins, there is the other star! I think I would give this another try, the baby backs maybe, and the other sides. I had to go on line and check to see if the spare ribs were pork because I thought they may have been beef ribs, that is how off they were."}
{"text":"Jim N Nick's ... Alabama meats North Carolina. The pork is wood smoked as it is in most BBQ locations. Their plus is that their meat is tender and most time moist if you get a plate. You get a sandwich and all bets are off. Their sauces are a thicker red sauce more like what you'd find in Al, TN and Western, NC. Their Habanero sauce would be my favorite.   I understand they now offer a vinegar North Carolina Style sauce but I've yet to have it. That will be my next review as I prefer the Vinegar sauces.  Sides are awesome here and every Jim N' Nicks Location I've eaten at. My favorite sides are Potato Salas and Baked beans. But I will sometimes get their greens.  Their potato salad is very creamy, very tasty. It is just down right good. Their baked beans are some of the best around, a little sweet but extra good when you throw a little of your pork into them.  I will add that they offer sausage which is pretty good but again a bit sweeter than I'd like; their ribs are most times a pass for me. They are not bad but not outstanding either. When I am in the mood for something other than pork I get their catfish sandwich which is very good.  And if you like Lemonade, this is your place! Theirs is awesome.  This is a chain and you'll find locations across the Southeast; most of the locations in TN and AL. I see they also have a couple of locations in Colorado with more coming that way. They are one of if not the best BBQ Chain I've come across."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The atmosphere was cozy, and not too loud, like being in your friends house. I didn't know this was a chain restaurant until I read the reviews, but I wouldn't have known. Staff is super friendly and provided great service.  The complementary cheese \"biscuits\" were amazing, it was like a sweet cornbread mixed with biscuit and cheese, I ate 3 before my meal came, oops. The meal was delicious; I ordered a combo plate with 3 meats [chicken, pulled pork, brisket], side salad, and mashed potatoes. House dressing for the salad was simple and flavorful, the addition of both bacon and almonds made it more satisfying. I wish the brisket wasn't shredded, but it still had a great smoky flavor. I've never had \"white sauce\" before, but it's definitely worth trying with the chicken, it gives it a nice peppery kick.  The meals are pretty pricey [$20 for the combo plate] but the value was worth it since the portions are huge. Overall, great experience! I was visiting from out of town, but I know if I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came in town for a quick visit and glad I stopped here. You can never go wrong with a little southern bbq. The sweet tea was amazing and went well with the 2lbs of ribs we had. Drenched my fries in bbq sauce and I was in heaven!! Plus those cheese biscuits!! I'd fight someone for them lol"}
{"text":"NC BBQ! In an area filled with chains, I didn't have high hopes when walking into this place.  It was recommended by a coworker, so I wandered on in.   The decor is rustic and cozy. I definitely felt at home. The service was extremely friendly and very helpful. Good suggestions.  I had the pork in the forest.  So some variation of the name. Think salad with mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumber,  nuts, and a big pile a NC pulled pork. A mound right there in the middle of the salad... oh, and the whole salad is sprinkled with bacon!! Loved it!  You get your choice of dressing. I was full, especially since they bring out these amazing biscuits!! Small little bite size things. I could eat a whole basket...  And then dessert. An assortment of pies. Pecan pie. Peanut butter pie. Lemon pie. Oh so good...."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come here once a month, sometimes twice. We went yesterday and had the same experience we always have. Fast service, huge servings, and good food. The beef brisket is my favorite and their Mac and cheese is amazing. My favorite thing they have is the cheese muffins though, and they're free! We actually bought some of the mix to make them at home and they came out great as well. The plate we usually get is two meats and two sides of your choice for about $22. The portions are so big though, that we always have to get a box and eat an entire meal the next day with the leftovers! We've only ever had one waitress we weren't pleased with there and I haven't seen her there since. The rest of the times we have gone have all been great service. Brandon is our favorite waiter! I would highly recommend this place, as it's our favorite place to eat on this side of NC and SC."}
{"text":"Great barbecue and sauce. Loved the to go drive through. Not inexpensive, but really tasty pork"}
{"text":"521 is way better. The mac and cheese was great but beans, slaw, brisket not so much. The brisket is half fat."}
{"text":"We tried this place after several recommendations for my birthday dinner tonight. It was so good!  Based on tonight's experience, this is now my favorite BBQ place in Charlotte! I had the combo platter with pulled pork,  smoked turkey, their BBQ chips (amazing), and their collard greens! Also,  had the bartender make me a drink not on their drink menu, and she did a great job!"}
{"text":"Customer service is not the Best! The cashier seemed to not know what was on the menu and how to ring up what was!! Smh"}
{"text":"I just moved here from FL and wanted to go get some real southern BBQ so heard good things about this place and I wasn't disappointed at all! Ribs and pulled pork were amazing colored greens delicious! They have free cheese biscuits that are out of this world staff was super friendly and prices were good! Cocktails were good too"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and had the pulled pork platter with collard and garlic mashed potatoes. Great meal and funny server. I added them to my favorites list"}
{"text":"Took a coworker to lunch here today and it was a great experience from start to finish.  We were seated immediately, had a very short wait for our server who was smiling the entire time she waited on us.  She was helpful answering questions and generally very personable.   The food was great and the portions plentiful.  I had ribs, mac&cheese, and collards and my coworker had the loaded mac and cheese.  The ribs were tasty and the mac and cheese was better than a lot of restaurants but honestly the collards were the biggest surprise.  There were among the best I've had in a restaurant.   Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner one night while visiting great wolf lodge. The cheese muffins they brought out first were absolutely delicious! We ordered the cheese dip which was ok, but extremely spicy, so our son could not have it. I ordered the Carolina chopped pork with mac and cheese and potato salad. The chopped pork had little to no flavor by itself. I wanted to add bbq sauce but there were only two choices: sweet (which is the thinner type sauce) and habanero spicy. They did not have a regular bbq sauce that wasn't spicy. I didn't eat that much of my bbq due to lack of flavor and sauce. My husband had the half chicken with baked beans and mashed potatoes. Huge portion and said it was ok, but he said he wouldn't go back.  Our waitress was ok. I sat with an empty lemonade glass for approx 16min. When she came back by she was about to walk away so I had to ask for more to drink instead of her seeing my clearly empty glass and refilling it. When she brought our dinner, she walked away again without taking our appetizer or bread plate off the table to clear room. Had to call her back again to ask her to clear it.  Overall, it's an ok place, but with all the other restaurants in the area I would not go back here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy BBQ food so I had to try this new place.  The service was friendly and  the seating was  was comfortable, the atmosphere a bit noisy   The food menu:  reasonable prices for serving size , plenty of choices for chicken, beef, turkey, salads, soups  sandwiches?, appetizers. Menu says everything from scratch, not frozen.  Small  Cheese biscuits  were served.  They were sweet , moist and tender but did not taste cheesy at all .  My dining mate and  I ordered the half smoked BBQ chicken with each  a side of coleslaw ,BBQ potato chips and I also had the onion rings and paid extra from them as a side.   The food was exceptionally salty to my taste . The Morgan white sauce was very hot  and I really  prefer a sweeter Alabama white sauce . The onion rings also had a spicy after taste in the breading, a little bit too much for my taste.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the fresh tasting coleslaw!  The portions were plentiful, the  chicken meat was moist , pink smoked and tender.   I had a chance to look at all the products that they were selling at the entrance, so I looked at their BBQ rub .  The second ingredient was monosodium glutamate .  I had asked the manager if they use that in their food as the rub and he thought not but when I told them that their products have monosodium glutamate in it he wasn't aware of that.   He told me next time to take off the skin or get the pulled chicken which has no skin on. However the chicken was  still very salty even when I removed the skin.  A lady across from me ordered the huge loaded baked potato, a meal in itself. Something to try next time.  I would go back again and perhaps try the brisket.  I don't mind well seasoned food but don't care for \"salt\" as the first taste, otherwise I would give a better rating"}
{"text":"The driest brisket I have ever eaten.   Service slow and bar menu very limited.  Definitely not a bbq place to visit."}
{"text":"I'll change this to 5 stars if my second visit is as good as my first.  Those cheesey biscuits all these reviewers talk about are just as good as they say.  I tried the 1/4 chicken plate and it came with both their original and the white sauce.  I loved them both.  The mac and cheese was good enough to go for just that.  I think it is a pretty good value at just $10 for 1/4 chicken, two sides and those biscuits.  I also had a really nice server.  Often times when a single dinner goes to a restaurant at dinner time they are neglected but my waitress was a kind and attentive as could be. When I couldn't finish the whole meal and asked for a box to take the rest home she even offered me a class of ice water to go.  (disclosure I almost always have just water with my meals because I'm always watching my calories....)  I'll be back for sure and hopefully the experience will be as good as this time."}
{"text":"All of the sides are good and the cheese bread rolls are addicting.  I have had both spare and baby back ribs and prefer the taste of spare ribs.  I will try the pulled pork on my next visit.  This place is highly recommended and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"The BBQ here was really good. I went with the pulled pork plate and I enjoyed it. They have really good sauces to compliment the pork, and as mentioned by many, the cheese muffins are great. One of the great benefits of coming here is they have a drive through which you don't see at many GOOD BBQ joints. They are slightly more pricey than some, but I guess that's the price to pay for convenience. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I love Jim N Nicks! We contacted with them to cater our family reunion picnic at Reedy Creek Park in Charlotte and they were great. Their service, friendliness and food was excellent. We had the Pig Pickin! They roasted the hog the night before and finished roasting at our picnic. The smell of the hickory smoke took me back to my childhood memories in South Carolina! Folks watched while the pig was pulled and carved up for presentation. Inside our shelter they presented the food, sides, and drinks professionally on a table and they served us buffet style. The food was absolutely delicious! There was no one dieting or Green Smoothie Cleansing on this day! Thank you guys for a wonderful lunch!"}
{"text":"I am from Wisconsin and I just flew in this afternoon to spend 2 weeks here for work. I arrived to my hotel, Holiday Inn, right across the street from Jim 'N Nicks Bar-B-Q. I went over to get some supper at 645 on Monday 5/21. I got the 2 meat platter with pulled pork and ribs, baked beans and coleslaw. I got my order given to me within 3 minutes of ordering! Seemed pretty fast, but I took it and went to my hotel....a total of 2 minutes passed until I opened the to go box and started to eat.  First off, both of the meats were cold, secondly they were extremely dry! The coleslaw was bitter and unpleasant to eat! The Cornbread muffins were average, and sadly the baked beans were the only decent part of the meal.  I travel all over the U.S. for my job and have BBQ anywhere I can, and this was by far the WORSE BBQ I have ever had! Way over priced too!  I would suggest going elsewhere if you want BBQ in Concord!  The staff greeted me right away, but then the waiter stood 2 feet from me the entire time I was looking at the menu just hawking me and waiting for an order."}
{"text":"Pulled pork BBQ sandwich was good, cabbage with bacon? very good....only complaint was the table BBQ sauce was runny, like water. BBQ sauce should be thick and stick to the? meat & bread. That sauce ran everywhere on the plate, me, and off the sandwich. The service was outstanding! Her mother & sis we're working there as well...family service!"}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars often, but in this case the service and the food is excellent!! We came here, because the bbq place we originally stopped for left us underwhelmed! We were greeted by one of the managers Tim, who told us we made a great choice coming in! Then the second manager, Trey came over and offered to let us sample some bbq! We had the ribs, pulled pork and chicken! Delicious! Then we had the macaroni and cheese, buttery, creamy and cheesy! The peach tea is delicious too! I highly recommend this place if you enjoy finger licking bbq! The atmosphere is super laid back and cozy!!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits ever!!! I love this place. My boyfriend and I are now regulars. Get the pulled pork nachos... I repeat.. get the pulled pork nachos. I am always craving them. Honestly the best thing on the menu. You really can't go wrong with anything. The BBQ sauce is to die for.   Great customer service! Servers are always friendly and work as a team. Food comes out fresh every time."}
{"text":"The food was unbelievably good!!!!! I enjoyed every morsel of it. The restaurant was clean. Our server was nice as well. The only thing I didn't too much care for was the $3.00 deviled eggs but they were good."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Absolutely the best Carolina BBQ I've ever eaten. I'm usually hesitant to try new BBQ places but this one takes the tops. The cream collards and macaroni cheese is awesome as well."}
{"text":"I loved that the bartender called me \"baby\". She was an absolute sweetheart. Endearingly southern.  only 3 stars because they had no pork because their smoker was broke. I was disappointed since I came for the BBQ. The chicken I had was good though..."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and went two days ago.  We had a great experience and food was delicious.  However, we went back tonight and never even got seated. The hostessses never smiled, were very short with us and overall horribly unfriendly. They underestimated the wait time and when asked they told my husband we were next in line.  They then proceeded to seat three more groups in front of us without explanation. Unfortunately, a business is only as good as their worst employee and because of this experience we would never visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Ohmygosh!!! This place was AWESOME! My daughter & I found it on Yelp while traveling home from a local concert & were not disappointed! The staff was super friendly, the service was quick & the good was homemade perfection. It was a busy Sunday afternoon, but they were turning over tables efficiently. Our waitress suggested the deviled eggs, pulled pork and smoked chicken. They were very good. The collards were too spicy, but she exchanged them for black-eyed peas which were fine. Try the banana pudding if you have room left :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Service. The pulled pork was amazing, and the cheese biscuits as well. When I told them it was my first time eating there they gave me and my companions free samples."}
{"text":"I stopped in here tonight for dinner, it was real close to the hotel so it was easy to get to. I did not realize before tonight that this restaurant is actually a franchise throughout the country.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the barbecue was outstanding. They had some authentic Carolina style sauces as well as Carolina pulled pork.   I ordered the two meat combo and it was more than enough food for myself. I also tried the deviled eggs tonight they were really good. If you see a JIM n nicks somewhere throughout the country I would recommend stopping in. This is the second JIM N nicks I have eaten at and the food is been outstanding and consistent.  I would go to this place again next time I'm in town. Very good"}
{"text":"Wow we love to do a family combos for bbq. Don't do it here. They used to be generous in portions, not any more. The portion for a meal combo eas less food than a 3 meat combo plare. What a joke. Take out .. =  taken. Had to fix salads to make things stretch. For 40 dollars worth I would expect better..."}
{"text":"Food was decent, not great but acceptable and decent. There was a smoke idiot that permeated my body clothing everything, so that I needed a showerno should be able to go out to eat and not smell like barbecue"}
{"text":"Wasn't disappointed but hate that they were out of ribs.  So I tried the pull pork sandwich which was a little pricey  $8 was good but worth half the price. Oh the onion rings were awesome!"}
{"text":"Five stars for both excellent food and service. The MVP of the meal was the baked beans side (sweet sauce and cooked with pulled pork) that I had with my brisket sandwich. Queso appetizer and cheese biscuits to start were great as was my friend's pulled pork sandwich and potato salad side. Our waitress was prompt, friendly, and always had the drinks topped off so no complaints there. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Brisket is moist and tasty, ribs are seasoned just right and pulled pork is good too. You can watch football games and still hear everyone at your table."}
{"text":"Come for the huge mugs of beer. Stay for some big ass ribs.  I usually don't want to review chain places, simply because most chain places are mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The food was really good and they had good beer available in big frosty mugs. This was my first experience with ribs in the south and it was a good one. I don't care for chains that much, but I would go back if I find myself in the south again."}
{"text":"3/10/2017  I've wanted to try this spot for quite sometime because it seemed popular. Every time I've drove passed always super crowded.  I came with a party of four: one person ordered the catfish sandwich, brisket sandwich, and 2 had the BBQ chicken with 2 sides collards and Mac and cheese.  One of the people in our party did not like the brisket, the waiter took away and the manager came over handling the situation perfectly. Apologizing so many times which I hadn't seen in a long time, but you could tell he was truly passionate in the business and wanted all of his customers to enjoy the experience in eating in the restaurant. We assured him we were great. The manager ended up taking the brisket off of the bill and allowing them to order something else at no charge. With that service alone this place will be around for sometime  and I would recommend this place for some gooooddd BBQ."}
{"text":"We love going to Jim and Nicks!  I order the Turkey Sandwich with Mac n Cheese & collard greens!  The sweet tea is good and the banana pudding is ever better!  Those cheese biscuits are AMAZING!  One of my favorite places to eat in Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"Ribs were tough and dry. Beef brisket was flavorless and not tender (not tough but not great). Glad I had my dental floss close by. Mac and cheese was delicious. Potato salad and bbq beans were acceptable. Corn muffin and sweetened tea (even after cutting it with unsweetened tea) were way too sweet. Was very expensive $32 dollars! I'm not sure how people on yelp have been raving in their reviews about this place. To me, dry tough ribs are a deal breaker. I was looking for a bbq alternative to midwood smokehouse."}
{"text":"My Dad and I have dinner out once a week and he really enjoys coming here . That being said the food quality has diminished in the last year and the last time was probably the last time we'll be back. The waitstaff is great and they are super attentive. And it's so disappointing bc the food used to be amazing. On our last visit , I got the Southern burger and my dad had his usual catfish platter. We waited so long for the food and when we finally said something it was delivered immediately. My cheese wasn't even melted on my burger and it was lukewarm, my dad's meal was also cold so much that his sides dishes congealed. They did do the right thing and took care of the meal and also offered us a gift card. Unfortunately The food was awful   . I don't know if it's new management or not but they need to get it together ."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Woooooo! Where do I start! The parking lot is small and packed (that is usually a good sign). We only had to wait 5 mins. for a party of 4 for a booth. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the wings, and the sausage. The onion rings were hot, big and tasty. Now for the awesome list: The rolls, spare ribs, mac & cheese, mash potatoes with gravy, greens, fried green tomatoes, and the lemon ice pie! The potato salad was ok it needed some mustard. The fresh squeezed lemonade that's not too sweet was good. Our server Kristen was awesome! Both bathrooms were pretty clean. You know what they say about first impressions. We will be back! I think I just found my new rib joint!"}
{"text":"Don't get it to go without checking it!!! Third time!!!!  Ordered and paid extra for double BBQ Chicken in the nachos. Also tipped $5 in the order because I asked for extra sauce, sour cream  and peppers on side. Got home and nothing on the side and absolutely NO double chicken, couldn't even find any chicken!!!  Did have my Son take it back and he came back after waiting 30 min with double chicken but now couldn't find the nacho chips!  Offered no discount or apologize.   Sad!!!!!  Missing the old manager!!!  Sweet great guy short with long reddish beard!  He always made things right! And still did NOT SEND ANYTHING I ASK FOR ON THE SIDE!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place.  Every time we come here we could never decide what to order because the menu overall is just great.  Service is always on point and food is always executed above our expectations."}
{"text":"Food was decent on my first visit, not incredible, but maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Would be willing to give it another chance due to the service. The staff was incredibly friendly, EVERYONE. Especially jasmine , our waitress. She wen above and beyond on service, she was engaging, funny, sweet, and overall a pleasure to have. I would come back to the restaurant on service alone. The staff represents the restaurant very well, kudos to management."}
{"text":"The Mac N' Cheese was really good, as was the potato salad and the bread (cheese biscuit), bbq sauce and the pickles.  My pulled pork sandwich was a little drier than i would have preferred, but that's likely because I didn't have any beer with this meal.  I would come back and try the ribs if given a chance.  I'd also get beer with it too.  All in all a fun experience that I enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of bad BBQ. This was not bad, but it wasn't great either.   I had the \"pick 4\" sampler. The ribs were a bit tough and not as juicy as I would have expected. They had decent smokey flavor and the BBQ sauces were good but altogether they were average. The brisket was unremarkable, pretty much what you get most chain type places. The pulled pork was better than average but not by much. Of all the meats I tried the sausage was the best in comparison to what I have had elsewhere. It had good flavor and just the right amount of heat.  As for the sides... The mac and cheese was just ok, I wasn't impressed by the beans, the grilled corn was alright but nothing special. The highlight was actually the corn bread. The bread is made into little corn bread muffins which were absolutely excellent.  I should say that the service was excellent and helped to make the overall experience A-OK instead of just ok.  Overall I would say it is a typical family friendly chain that might serve the purpose if you are hungry but is not a must visit when in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get bbq. The service is always great and the the food is exceptional! It is a must try if you're in the concord area!!"}
{"text":"Brought my mom here for lunch after she flew in, as a stopover to shopping at Concord Mills. I was pleasantly surprised! Service was prompt. Ambiance was cute. And the food was very good! Authentic BBQ! We shared a couple of dishes so we could have a salad, a baked potato topped with pulled pork, and a sandwich. It was all mighty tasty & fresh! Reasonably priced. Will eat here again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today and was impressed!  Great service!  Top notch!  Food arrived fresh, piping hot and our server couldn't have been more accomodating.  We will be back!  My daughter is obsessed with the Mac n Cheese."}
{"text":"In the south one would expect great BBQ. Sorry, but this place does not have it. Located in the former Bob Evans restaurant, they changed the decor for the better. The service was good, but the food was not. The food was all fresh and made on the premises, but I have not seen so much fat and grizzle in pulled meat items, as I did here. Had to start eating my pulled pork with a fork, out of fear I would be bitting into another large piece of fat. I realize it takes time to make sure you are pulling good meaty pieces and not just the fat, but apparently they weren't taking that time. My sandwich was 3/4 fat and 1/4 actual meat. Not a pleasant thing. I have had better baked beans elsewhere too. Kind of sad, when I found better southern BBQ in NYC rather than NC."}
{"text":"Food is great- especially the cheese biscuits. BBQ is good, mac and cheese is great, lots of great food options but it is slightly overpriced especially for BBQ."}
{"text":"I was on a southern kick during my stay in Charlotte and decided to grab some classic BBQ to go for dinner. I was so happy to see they had a drive thru and how quick and efficient it was.   They didn't have it on the menu, but I went with the 2 meat plate of Carolina style pork and hot links, with a side of collard greens and mac and cheese (of course). I forgot to ask for these biscuits I heard about, but they included 2! With a drink, it came out to about $20.  I was amazed at how much food they give, and glad they provided some sauces on the side. The Carolina pork wasn't as vinegar-y as I had anticipated, but they did provide a sauce for that. It went well together. I wasn't expecting 3 hot links (I had expected 1!) and it was a LOT of food. Pork was really tender, hot link was perfectly cooked. The collard greens...too vinegar-y for me and realized I'm not a fan of it. The mac and cheese, I was REALLY disappointed. It was so incredibly bland? I eat on the blander side so that's saying a lot when I have to sprinkle salt on top? The best part was the fluffy cheddar biscuits. So light and freshly baked, complimented the meat so well.  Overall, I was pretty disappointed in the sides, but would try again with different sides next time."}
{"text":"We stopped in at 6:30 pm on a Saturday night and had only a brief wait.  Our table ordered spare ribs, baby back ribs, smoked chicken, mac and cheese, green beans, and fried green tomatoes.  We were only sorry we did not have room for dessert as the pie selection looked terrific and the menu assured us they were made fresh daily.  Our waiter was great - he had been with the chain for several years, and really knew the menu.  Four thumbs up from our bunch!"}
{"text":"We loved it! Great smoked BBQ all around (ribs, pulled pork, chicken) and the sides were all rather good too for a change. *Note - avoid the Brisket.  I've had it 4 times and they can't get Brisket right here. It's always tough and dry. I feel like many BBQ places don't put much effort into the extras but this place has decent sides. You get an endless basket of amazing cheese biscuits if you dine in, score!  Prices are reasonable, maybe a little high. Slightly stingy portions - not quite enough for leftovers. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"What a great BBQ place.  We had the pulled pork and the chicken and both were excellent.  The BBQ is moist with just the right degree of smokiness.  They have different sauces, mild and spicy.  The side dishes are scrumptious, especially the Mac and cheese.  For dessert, don't pass on the banana pudding.  The service was also top notch during our visit.  A great restaurant which we will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent cheese biscuits!!!! The best ive had in many years!!! The mac & cheese was good as well. Love the drive thru option. Will definitely be a staple. Heard great things about the chicken, ribs & bbq, cant wait to try on my next visit."}
{"text":"I take no particular pride in being a North Carolina BBQ \"connoisseur\". However, I *AM* from Greensboro, which places me somewhere between the Eastern vs. Lexington BBQ factions and I've eaten my fair share of pig, including a few pig pickin's. I immediately grab the eyeballs and the cheeks. I ALWAYS like to try something relatively new so, on a recent trip to Charlotte with my 10-year-old in tow, decided to visit Jim 'n Nick's BBQ on a Thursday morning at their 11 am opening. Some people had told me to drop by for some \"good BBQ\". Don't get me wrong, there are MANY MANY foods I have not eaten, and Eastern BBQ falls into that category, so I was anxious to try BOTH Eastern and Lexington (which I grew up with). So few restaurants sell both. These folks DO! My son is still in that phase where he'll only eat certain foods (although, oddly, he LOVES my braised salmon + peas!) so I experimented with him. I offered him a TINY portion of Lexington, which he accepted as \"OK\" but spit out the Eastern. I was raised on Stamey's BBQ here in Greensboro and, in MY opinion, Stamey's rocks. They only serve Lexington. Jim 'n Nick's serves both, including brisket. Brisket is a tough dish to pull off as it dries out easily. I tried a combination with brisket and pulled pork with sides of collards and potato salad with sweet tea. The brisket meat was fairly tender but was not moist. I'd give it a very average \"C\". Also, this combination cost about 20 bucks. That was a bit overpriced... the portions were average... what I got shouldn't have been over $15 -- max. The pulled pork was about the same, although a bit more moist. Now, keep in mind, EVERYBODY gets the right to like or dislike what they want. I found the Eastern sauce too pungent to the point of inedible. I have nothing against vinegar. On the other hand I found Jim 'n Nick's OWN proprietary catsup/vinegar/pepper-based sauce to be EXCELLENT. You should buy a bottle, take it home and go wild with it! TRULY SUPERB! The potato salad was good enough, not that super-creamy mush some restaurants scoop into a small bowl. I'd give it a \"B-\". The collards were like you'll rarely find -- this dish was heaping with what appeared to be collard greens picked out back 10 minutes ago! NOT mushy, NOT unidentifiable greenery and NOT over-cooked. Perfectly cooked, as a matter of fact... \"A+\" Sweet tea was not overly sweet (\"A\"). Service was perfect (A+) I didn't try any libations, but they appeared to have an interesting supply of beers and hard liquors, although not extensive. By the time we left (just after 12 noon), the place was getting seriously packed. I didn't get the slaw as a side because the waitress said it was the creamy mayo-based type. There's only one slaw to eat with BBQ and that's \"red slaw\" -- the type they serve at Stamey's. Don't worry, I don't work for Stamey's, it's just that, if you want super-flavorful NC BBQ, Stamey's (and other Lexington BBQ joints, especially actually *IN* Lexington, NC). It is against such establishments that I grade Jim 'n Nick's. 3 stars, not because it's BAD (it's not) but because Yelp says three stars = \"A-OK\". Yep... it's A-OK, but there's better NC BBQ out there in abundance. PS: VERY cool music playing in the background... ie: when I heard \"Hey Lawdy Mama\" by Steppenwolf it shocked me out of my BBQ jam... heard Beatles too. Lots of other good stuff that threw me back to my childhood!!! (A++!!!!)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ nachos around and at an unbeatable price. Also have the best banana pudding and lemonade. Every time I've been there we have had great service with no wait for a table."}
{"text":"What a great place to grab some great southern BBQ!   You can easily get to this off of I-85 exit 49, few lights down and your there.  There service is fast and very friendly.  They are very accommodating for groups and can handle it in a timely manor.   Place is very clean and will put together for a BBQ place.  I got the Carolina-Style Pork is to great, you get plenty of food to fill your belly.  They serve you these awesome Cheese Biscuits which are addicting. There side seem to be home-style and very good, I had the Mac & Cheese and Mash Potatoes which were very good!   They do offer a Kids menu with a good selection of options for the kids. There was a Lil Piggie in the Garden salad on the kids menu, which is hard to find. If my niece was with me she would have love it.   If you don't like BBQ, no worries they have Hamburgers/Cheeseburgers, Catfish Sandwich, Grilled Chicken Sandwich and even a Pimento Cheese Sandwich, bottom line good selection of Food!!   They offer reasonable prices, friendly staff and fast delicious meals!"}
{"text":"The food is DEFINITELY NOT as good as the one at Steel Creek location.  I asked our waitress if I can substitute one of the meats for chicken and she said she wasn't sure.  She later came by and told me they couldn't do so.  When's the last time you couldn't substitute an item at a restaurant?!  Even McDonald's lets you alter how your item(s) are made.  Just in case people didn't know, this place used to be a BOB EVAN'S Restaurant that closed down and was vacant for quite some time.  I guess it's following its footsteps somehow."}
{"text":"Now Jim and Nicks is one of the better BBQ places in the area (we have been here previously) and I was craving a traditional BBQ meal only to be let down.  We ordered A combo plate of 2 and a Pulled chicken sandwich.   All of our meat was luke warm at best along with our sides (minus my fries that came piping hot and my coleslaw, that would obviously be terrible if served warm). By the time our waiter had made his rounds to see how the food was we were already half way through the meal and I was on time crunch.   Unfortunately I think it will be awhile until we venture back out to this Jim and Nicks location."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there and came away extremely impressed.  We got smoked chicken, pulled pork and their sausage links and all of it was extremely well done.  Their sauce is spicy, but not to the point of just \"pure heat\".  The meat was all tender and the portions were plenty big.  Service kept us full on drinks, offered suggestions with what to try and brought us more cheese biscuits as soon as our basket was empty.    While we understand its a chain, the food and service did not feel anything like that.  Great time had there."}
{"text":"I love to eat here on Sundays because that's the day they have chicken fried chicken with homemade white gravy. Everything in this restaurant (even though it's a chain) is scratch made. Their pies are fantastic too. Coconut custard was my favorite. BBQ is great and the Mac n cheese is divine. Try it!"}
{"text":"We are gonna give it another go before we fully form our opinion. Service was great, the restaurant has good ambiance. We sat in a comfy booth near the kitchen which at times was distracting but everyone was working hard, didn't hear any foul words or complaining.  My husband ordered a BBQ chicken dish with a pepper cream type sauce, he loved it. I had macaroni & cheese with diced ham. It was bland, probably one of my least fav Mac & cheese meals. I wouldn't eat that again. I had a side of slaw, it was ok. We ordered onion rings and they came panko crusted and were amazing! Amazing. Only complaint is that there was no hook in the bathroom (which has nice tile work) to hang my purse.   There's a tv in the bar area but I didn't notice any others. Not sure how sports fans would like that.   Servings are huge. We took our lunch home with us and I had enough remaining M&C and to share between me and my two kids too.   We are going back again, it can only be better. The manager came by to check with us and the waitress was on top of us refilling drinks and asking if we were content. Our bill also had a survey that if completed would give us an offer for a free appetizer. Onion rings coming up!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends and all of us left full and happy! Staff was great and the food was exactly what you would expect from a southern BBQ joint - and that's a good thing! We were too stuffed to try the pie, but would happily come back and try to save some room."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many of a time.  Not once had a bad meal or bad service. Totally addicted to those little cheese muffins they serve!!! The brisket is quite good as is most of the items I have tried there.  Most definitely recommend eating at Jim n Nicks.  Good family value and affordable."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and have not enjoyed their bbq or their prices. It was nearly impossible to get a drink refill and service was lacking. They brought out my salad right before everyone's entrees so there was no time to finish it to clear room. I had to hold my salad bowl while I ate because there was no room. Prices are way to high for the quality of food. The pulled pork was much sweeter than I prefer, but the brisket was ok. If I stop back in it will only be for the mac n' cheese."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review because I dont want tons of people to discover this wonderful place!!  My husband and I went just to check it out and found 'our new favorite' restaurant.  We ordered steak and I will have to say that it was unequivocably the best steak I have ever eaten!  Everything about our experience was absolutely perfect.  Our server, the cocktails, the beer was the coldest ever...there was not a single thing that I could offer to improve our meal.  If you want a place that is comfortable, reasonably priced, with impeccable service and food, try Jim N Nicks!"}
{"text":"This is one of wifey's favorite restaurants in the Charlotte area.  When we are back down in the Carolinas, this is a MUST stop.  While the BBQ is not the greatest, it is a very good version...kind of a \"Texas\" style with Brisket, Pork, Sausage, Turkey, etc.  Not a typical Carolina barbecue place with just chopped pork...  First course...the cheesy corn bread muffins...OUTSTANDING!  As another reviewer said, I can eat them all day!  These are fantastic...and now...they will sell you the mix so you can make them at home...  For me, I typically get their barbecue turkey with fries.  Their turkey is smoked and very juicy.  They put a bit of their barbecue sauce on it...and away you go.  Very good turkey.  The fries are hand cut and well fried...another winner.  Wifey typically gets the brisket and really likes it as well.  I have found it to be well prepared and also quite juicy...not dry as many restaurants make it.  Finally, the lemonade (my fav) and sweet tea (wifey's fav)...both are very good and come with some crushed ice that makes them even colder!"}
{"text":"Best Bbq in town! And not just the food, the energy of the place is amazing. Right from the host to the servers, the decor and music everything makes it the THE place to go to even on a Saturday night! Never seen such happy employees with a packed restaurant and a big waiting line. And where do i start about the food - we were a party of four and we couldn't stop eating of each others place. Not a thing i would say we didn't love. Sausage links were my super fav! So happy I live nearby!"}
{"text":"JIm n Nicks used to be hands down my favorite restaurant! I first discovered this place years ago and used to drive 40 minutes to the Steele Creek Location to eat it. We were thrilled when we found out we had a Jim n Nicks within 15 minutes! This then became a regular eating establishment for both myself and my family. This included any family that comes in from out of town the first place they wanted to eat was Jim n Nicks. We have slowly seen the decline in this restaurant. The quality of food has diminishing, the recipes that we have gotten accustomed to keeps changing. The quality of service at this location in particular is terrible! No one ever seems to want to be at work including the management. We have gone from being a 3 times a week regular at this establishment to a peek in once a month (only to see if it has gotten any better) type of customer. It is really sad to be so close to our favorite restaurant however no longer want to eat there."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  We have been back 2 in two months.  Super nice staff and the ribs are awesome.  My only wish is if they were closer to Ballantyne but I think they are opening a second location."}
{"text":"Overall a solid place if you're looking to get some quality BBQ. The corn bread was delicious, baked to perfection and included a great sweet component. I ordered an appetizer being the smoked ribletts. Gotta say they were pretty fricking good. I added alot of BBQ sauce (mild) to them but they were cooked to perfection and made me think that if I got the ribs they would have been amazing. For my main course I ordered the double-decker, a BBQ sandwich with brisket and pulled pork. I also got 2 sides being the fresh fruit and the mac n cheese. The sandwich it's self was good, pretty average, but still good. The fresh fruit was average and the mac n cheese was some of the better I've had in my day.   The truth on this Restaurant is that everything is house made so it's all gonna be semi decent at the least. Nothing really blew me out of the water, but if you're looking for a quality meal for a reasonable price. Jim n Nick's is the place to go.   PS- The asian server is a great guy, always smiling and can answer any questions you have. laughs at just about anything you say and always makes sure you're table is taken care of."}
{"text":"I went here on my own, in town for work.  I ordered the steak and was unsatisfied.  I told the waitress of my issue and they immediately comped my meal.  I begged them not to, but they did.  I left her the balance of what I should have paid as a tip.  It's a barbeque place, get barbeque!  Great people and a great business."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars, as the food is delicious, but Emily literally drops the place 2 stars.  Other waitstaff we have had in the past were amazing, but Emily?  Not so much.  We were there on 6/10/2014 and got Emily as our server.  If Emily spent a FOURTH of the time with our table as she did talking with friends or flirting with all male tables, our service would have been great.  Instead, we had to flag down other servers for our refills, to check on our food, which was ready and lukewarm, obviously sitting for a while.  Her other two tables received attentive service.  When I flagged her down finally for ketchup, she sighed, because how dare I bother her.  Another server brought it out.  We only saw her again when she brought our bill and was suddenly all smiles and friendly!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food.  Canned atmosphere.  Food is average.  Service is average.  Soulless corporate bbq."}
{"text":"Food was fine, service was not. I went it at lunch alone and when I said I was alone was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar??? The waitress Leigh came over, I asked what the soup was, she asked if I wanted soup and salad, no it was a question.  I ordered, the soup (Brunswick stew) came out, I had maybe four bites and here is the food, I did not even get a chance to taste the food, and the bill was there, what if I wanted something to go or dessert??? She NEVER checked on me until she came to pick up the bill, I needed a box for leftovers, pointed out that she had never checked on me, she said she was watching me????  I am usually a very good tipper but not this time.  Sorry she is so unhappy there, when I said that to her, she said she loved her job???  I guess her job is to practically throw the food on the table and then leave, I told her I thought she had left because of the lack of attentiveness to a customer...."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this is NOT my famous mouth watering BBQ.  Now that I got that out of the way, it is not that bad. Of all of the BBQ places in town, this is probably the best one near me.  The menu is pretty diverse, the place is always packed, and the food is consistently good.  On this visit we chose to use the call ahead seating. I would strongly recommend this option if you are visiting on the weekends, as it is not worth 30 minutes or longer to wait.  The hostess was very kind, and we only had to wait 5 minutes for our table.  Our server was very friendly and courteous, but she did seem to be a bit preoccupied as she came to our table with small plates(with bread in hand), but neglected to leave those wonderful cheese biscuits we were anticipating.  We had to ask for those delightful morsels of cheese and bread. ( I have added a picture). This is a very important part of the meal.  On this occasion I had the Double Decker with beef, with Mac and Cheese.  It was surprisingly big, yet I was able to manage to get my mouth around this monstrosity without making a mess. ( I have added a picture)  I would recommend this to any BBQ fan, however we all now that in the south, we are very persnickety about our BBQ. Every opinion will vary, but again, my friends and family know BBQ and they come to me for the good stuff.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Everything we had was great. the mac n cheese is very cheesey- although I suspect it is msde with a flour rue as there was a grainy feel to the texture. All staff was pleasant and polite. We will return in the future."}
{"text":"I HAD to try some North Carolina BBQ since I came here for work and one of my coworkers recommended this place to me so I decided to give it a try since she was a local and so I did for dinner tonight.   I got the 4 meat Mr. Jim's Deluxe combo so I could try a little bit of everything. I chose the brisket, classic pulled pork, baby-back ribs, and the smoked chicken along with mash potatoes and macaroni & cheese for my sides.  The brisket was ok but the ribs were pretty damn good. The pulled pork was up there with the ribs as well. My favorite was the chicken because it was so moist and tender. The mash potatoes were delicious and that gravy is to DIE for! I put that gravy on everything. The macaroni was so rich and cheesy. The best part about eating there were the unlimited cheese breads which is like heaven in your mouth!   I would definitely recommend this to those who are visiting Charlotte, NC!"}
{"text":"Very nice service, food came out very fast, good selection of beers on draft and in bottles and wines and liquors. Might have given it four stars but my expectations for the food were very high given I am a Northern who was in the South eating BBQ. It was good, just didn't think it was great or any better than the better, locally owned BBQ restaurants back in Michigan. I ordered the two meat combo (Carolina pulled pork and turkey) with two sides(collards and fresh fruit). I enjoyed the meal especially the pork, but wasn't blown away either. I understand this a chain in the South. It's good. I'd eat there again. Just with different expectations."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it. We brought some folks who are moving to the area. We had read some reviews and took a chance. Wait staff very very friendly...never said no...food was very good....will come back"}
{"text":"I think Jack 'n Nicks has the best BBQ and Brisket in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Great to have some good BBQ around and not have to drive 4 hrs to Charleston to enjoy this southern treat!  As much as I was a fan of Bob Evans, this Jim and Nick's is a welcomed sight.  You still have your plethora of choices in the area, but if you are craving BBQ and some southern hospitality, definitely go to J&N.  Last visit I tried the special.  \"Pork and Grits\" which was a nice play on shrimp and grits...  The waitstaff is friendly and prompt.  Be prepared to spend an average of $15 for lunch including the tip.  Not the cheapest lunch option in the area, but definitely a good one if you are feeling some BBQ."}
{"text":"More than decent NC BBQ  I was visiting from Chicago and my friend (who is local) suggested this spot. They were nice, service was good and the food was very good too. I'm a bit of a cheapskate so take this with a grain of salt...I thought the portions were \"OK.\" I would have liked them to be a bit bigger and on the plate versus the tiny cafeteria bowls. The little muffins were a highlight. All in all I enjoyed it. I wasn't exactly wowed but would go again. How's that for no -committal?"}
{"text":"Jim 'N Nick's does a great job. The meals are on the higher priced side (especially since a recent price increase) but the meals are always worth the spend. Restaurant is always very clean as well. A great place for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Great barbecue. Ordered the combination plate. A bit expensive."}
{"text":"I am a big brisket fan, so I ordered the brisket platter. The portion was small but the flavor was even smaller or non-existant. The was absolutely no flavor other than the vinegar based sauce they used, which wasn't very good either. The brisket had no noticeable smoke ring and had smoke flavor. The brisket was dry and chewy except for the sauce.  The onion ring were bland, nothing special. The menu said cold beer and they couldn't even get that right. Over-all I was highly disappointed. I was hoping to find some place closer to home than Mac's speed shop for good brisket but I guess I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Dinner Jan 25   Been eating Jim N Nicks since 1995 in Birmingham. And frequent other ones in Charlotte area - which I absolutely love!  For those not knowing, this is not \"Lexington, NC\" style BBQ, if you are looking for that - don't go.  It's Alabama style (yes, there is a Alabama Style).   What you should know is they raise their own hogs.  They make ALL sides in house.  And all meat is smoked on premise.   I am chalking up my dining experience at this location to them being relatively new AND I WILL BE BACK!    BUT...............   It is my hope that they make sure they pay attention to the details and remember what has made this regional chain so so good for so so long!   Fresh/moist smoked meats - not dry/left over old cold meat (throw it out DONT serve it)   Fresh cut fries - not fries that are old and soggy (make fresh fries to order)   Chocolate Pie that is fresh - no scratch pie is GOOD after a few days (don't serve if it is no longer good & that doesn't get thrown away 1/4 eaten)   I truly hope the folks at the store do a reset - rededicate the cooks/wait staff  to serving only the best product with the highest standards - do it right the 1st time as many consumers wont give you a 2nd time."}
{"text":"Lunch on Sep 16   No matter what I order or the people I am with order, it comes out Ridiculously GOOD!  Not even good, its INCREDIBLE!   New Favorite Food there:  Hamburger with Pimento Cheese - NOT on the menu, but ask for it, they will do it for you.  WOW what a burger!   Next new Favorite Food there: Chicken sandwich with Morgan County White Sauce! Who needs tomato based barbecue sauce when you got Alabama style white sauce!   I have NEVER had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Pulled chicken with white sauce. Enough said. The chips with white dipping sauce are yummy. The cornbread muffins are a must try. Ask for them if they don't come out before your dinner.  Mac and cheese is perfect. Casual as most bbq places are. Bring the kids."}
{"text":"Was not really impressed with the BBQ or the sauce, especially for the price. The atmosphere and look were great but there are so many locations around town that are so much better"}
{"text":"One of the company's vendor's in Canada ordered lunch for my office and one of the guys went to pick it up instead of delivery (Christmas busy season); we had brisket, chopped pork, potato salad (not home made but good); baked beans and sliced spiced pickles (unique but good) and of course SWEET TEA.  This was my first experience, they did good.  Will order again for the office and myself."}
{"text":"Good smoked turkey brisket was ok I like a little more smoke and a bit less dry awesome cheese/corn bread Mac and cheese is pre packed and sits a while killer chips and the drive through is really nice people seemed helpfull over all good place could not give a 5 star but real close."}
{"text":"We come down here 2 or 3 times a year for different events and while this place isn't our primary destination, we try to eat here at least once during our stay in town.  This was the case today, usually the food is very good. Today was a different story though, the wife ordered the loaded potato and I had the BBQ nachos. Both of which came out with just a tiny bit of warmth, certainly not hot. The worst part was we were there at 4 in the afternoon and they were not busy. I sent the nachos back to be warmed up, they came back just barely warmer than they went back. The server was great but the kitchen is hurting bad."}
{"text":"Ahhh! The aroma in the air from the smoking of bbq will draw you in quickly! The eastern style bbq, ribs, turkey and smoked wings are all good. The baked beans and mac n cheese are tasty. Don't forget the cheese muffins! The restaurant is very clean and nicely designed to accommodate families. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Good Carolina style BBQ. Just a little too much vinegar--saying a lot, I know.   Service was a little slow that afternoon, but it was quite busy.   Cocktails were good and the food was tasty and filling.   I would most certainly frequent this place in the future.   Come hungry."}
{"text":"I eat here maybe three days a week. Turkey, macncheese, home made gravy. I could go on for days about the cheese biscuits."}
{"text":"Have eaten at these restaurants before and this one just didn't seem to hit the mark as well. Starting with the pros: the Cheesy Biscuits are amazing, the quesadilla and hot links appetizers were both very good, and prices are reasonable. For cons: the pulled pork was dry and not flavorful, even with the sauce provided on the table. The collards also lacked flavor and were swimming in water. Our waiter also wasn't the friendliest. He seemed annoyed to be answering questions about the menu initially, but then he was visibly perturbed when he brought out one big check at the end (we were a party of 6) without asking first, and we told him it would actually be 3 separate bills."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon before they got extremely busy. The place has a nice, cozy ambiance and they don't play annoying country music. The service was excellent. They brought out some amazing corn bread cheddar biscuits or something similar. I'm from the North and we don't do corn bread so I never had any that tasted good ever. But, let me tell you that whatever these muffins were, they were out of this world fabulous! Scrumptious actually, better than any regular corn bread. That's just the beginning: ordered the Carolina style BBQ plate with fries and baked beans. The BBQ was drenched in the delicious vinegar sauce and was bursting with flavor. The meat was tender and moist and was pulled nicely but still had some nice and crispy chunks. It was amazing. The fries were the fresh, skin on type and they were much better than your average fries. The beans were okay, nothing special and a bit too sweet for my liking. I ordered the peanut butter pie to split and it was homemade and decadent. Super tasty and not too big. You gotta try this place. I saw plenty of people ordering the onion rings and they looked fantastic. I imagine they do almost everything to perfection at this place."}
{"text":"Living close to this restaurant is going to be a problem for any intention to eat healthy in the New Year. I have been to events that they catered but had no idea how great their food on site would be!   My college roommate requested one last Southern meal before he returned up North. Since it had been a whirl wind weekend we went with the close option and had a great meal.   The cheesy biscuits came out warm and were delicious. Hands down the best cheesy biscuits I have had a restaurant. We raved about them in our little group and the waitress was kind enough to bring out another round on the house (not sure if that is standard practice or if she overheard us and decided to be generous).  I ordered the brisket plate with mac & cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese is super creamy and smothered in a plentiful cheese sauce. The baked beans were mildly spicy and a generous portion. The brisket was a little fatty for my taste but was tender and paired with a great sauce. The surprise star of the meal was the smoked turkey breast that the boyfriend got. Super juicy and delicious.   I will definitely go back soon and may have to roll home after the huge portion sizes!"}
{"text":"A bit unfair, but I like to compare every BBQ to the top one in my mind (Willard's Real Pit BBQ).  So, in saying that, the experience my family had did not match the scores I'm seeing on Yelp.  First, I want to say that this is a good establishment.  Clean, friendly service, delicious freebies.  However, the food portions did not reflect the correct pricing.  I am a big city guy and I have been to many cities as a veteran.  The BIG knock was that my brisket came out dry.  A BBQ place that can't serve juicy - tender brisket is damning in my eyes.  I'm not saying the rest of the food we ate was bad.  It was good.  But, again, does not reflect the good reviews I'm seeing on fellow Yelpers or pricing on par with big city BBQ places.  Sorry, Jim n' Nick.  I hope my next experience revises my review.  I really wanted to like your establishment."}
{"text":"Ok so the food is good here IF you can actually get it. I've been here 4 times now and every time they are out of virtually everything on the menu except pulled pork. Turkey you will never see in fact I wonder if it exists. Tonight, they were out of their prime rib special by 6:30 pm, and the cheese muffins, even though they have hundreds of bags of the stuff for sale.  Manager said he'd bring it out right away but that never happened. Ribeye was dry and overdone.  Sorry but it is true...these guys are BBQ posers. Dessert is good cause you're starving by then. Midwood down the road is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. The cheddar biscuits are the best and can cause fights at the dinner table. Bbq done to perfection."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here, and I must say it was a great recommendation by the rental car agent who suggested we give it a try. We ordered pulled pork, brisket and a ribeye steak..we also chose mac n cheese, collards and a wedge salad. The food was good, but the manager's genuine concern about an undercooked steak went above and beyond my expectations. We did not get the typical...sorry let me throw it back on the grill. Without us ever asking to speak to the manager, he took time out of what appeared to be a very busy night, to apologize and express genuine concern for us not having all of our food out at the same time. If I could give more than 5 stars for service they definitely deserve it. My food was good and also earned 5 stars (even with the steak having to be made a 2nd time...it was worth the short wait). I would definitely stop here again, next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Splitting this review into two parts food and service.  Food The food here is very good. I would say 4 out of 5 stars. I like the ribs and the sides are good as well. Queso dip is a good starter. Decent selection of beers. But it can be a little pricy for some things. Wife loves mac and cheese.  Service Typically the service here is average. We've never had out of this world service but it's always been enough to get through the evening without any issue. However, our last experience wasn't good at all. We had one round of refills by our waiter (the server who brought the food also gave us a round of refills). We then received the check and I placed my card in the holder with the check and placed it on the end of the table. We waited and waited and waited. After about 20 minutes and a lot of frustration we went to the bar and checked out ourselves. The bartender was very apologetic but our waitress didn't really seem to care all that much. This would be a 1 star and prior times would be 3 stars so I give it a 2.  Overall I gave this place a 3 out of 5 because the food is good and the service is usually acceptable. We will be trying some new BBQ places the next few times however."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about Jim & Nicks.  It's overpriced, the fries are yucky and the bbq is just \"alright\"... it's not great or memorable.  If you're starving, it will keep you alive, but if you want value for your dollar, unfortunately this isn't really the place to go."}
{"text":"This place has great bbq the muffins they give you are so good. It's good eating. Also love the peach tea. Deviled eggs are really good.The inside is a very cozy southern feel. They even have a drive thru which surprised me. Timing on the drive thru was not bad at all highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places when in Concord for southern smoked MEATS! *cue the meat sweats* Jim & Nicks has amazing food in an awesome atmosphere. My fav: smoked turkey, collard greens, Mac & cheese, and their banana pudding for dessert. I see you judging my inner fat girl... Don't do that! All of the staff wears a plaid shirt of their choosing to go with the souther flair. They also are awesome for catering and I've never met anyone that didn't like their food."}
{"text":"Can you say \"tasty?\"  You can if you've been to this newest BBQ place in Indian Land. Hot links and brisket were flavorful and the portions were bigger than I expected. I had greens and baked beans as sides. The greens were good and the beans were great!  Ambiance is good -  good music, big screen over the bar, open plan.   Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place is good.  Everything I've had has been homemade.  Their smoked turkey is very good.  They have a nice variety of sauces for their turkey and bbq.  Their muffins are really good as well and I could easily fill up on them."}
{"text":"When dining out, my husband and I always enjoy a glass of wine while waiting for our meal.  I ordered a glass of wine, which came with a glass and a carafe of wine.  Our server poored the wine from the carafe into a dirty glass.  The glass had water marks and smudges and looked disgusting, nothing I wanted to drink out of.  We were seated close to the bar, so my husband took the glass of wine to the bartender and asked for a clean glass.  She poured a new glass of wine, which was better than dumping wine from a dirty glass into a clean one, as some restaruants do; however, she didn't check/nor did she wash a new glass.  The glass of wine she gave us was a tad bit cleaner than what I had originally.  I drank my wine from the straw that was provided for my water.    Please, all businesses, the wine glasses need attention!  If/when your bartenders have some free time - have them rewash, reclean, whatever they need to do.  Keep your barglasses clean!  Please!    After that disappointment, my entree was served with a nice 6 inch black hair underneath my chicken.  It was not my server, as her hair was blond and was wrapped tightly in a bun on top of her head, nor was it ours as my husband and I are both blondes.  So, needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went to Jim 'N Nick's last Friday at 2:15 PM.  Maybe I should have gone during the lunch rush or dinner rush because the food was absolutely rancid.  The meat seemed to be defrosted and heated up.  Typically you should have a choice of sauce at a BBQ joint but the waiter brought the food dressed in sauce to cover up how nasty the meat looked on my plate.  The MacNChs was OK, the biscuits were decent and my nephew's cheeseburger seemed to have been sitting under a light for hours or maybe even defrosted and heated up.  NONE of our meat was fresh!  Ew."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, when Bob Evans pulled another round of closings out of their hat (apparently they do this with some regularity), there were a number of properties in the area left out to dry. Most were in relatively decent locations, like this one just across from Concord Mills, situated nicely near several hotels - albeit down in a bit of a hole.  After a good bit, the property was redeveloped into Jim 'n Nick's Bar-B-Q, and though it took a while, they did a nice job with the property. In fact, they are still working on it - just recently installing a nice sign out in front. Nothing fancy, just a brick base and lighted sign, but it's a nice touch.  On the inside, the wood is welcoming, and the staff is always friendly. The menu is solid, and food is typically served up quickly. Generally they can handle parties of larger sizes with ease, which is nice in this area. The only downside is that the bill can be a little large, but that's not entirely unexpected. As a bonus you almost always have food to take home with you!"}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time for an 8:00 dinner for a party of 8. We were seated pretty quickly, the servers and waitress were accommodating. Had a few apps, BBQ potato chips, onion rings, both were good. We ordered the riblets  too, which were not good, but tough and cold. The dinners were good, nothing special. The cardinal sin however were the ribs. I had the baby back and another person had spare ribs. Both, at best were average. Not tender, juicy, and lacking in flavor. I wonder if it was because we had a late seating on Wednesday night. The ribs seemed like leftovers. I can't recommend. The one thing a BBQ restaurant MUST get right is ribs."}
{"text":"Jim and nicks was super today.  The baby ribs were perfect, probably the best ribs I have ever had.  The smoked chicken is always great, super tender with great flavor.  Everything is unique at this restraunt from the lemonade and potato salad, to the pickles they serve.  Also the drive thru is convenient for times when I need to bring something home for the family."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Stopped here for a business meeting with one of my customers. I walked in and was gently greeted by the hostess. They asked if I was meeting anyone and that they would be happy to really me around and check if the rest of my party was already seated.  Upon getting seated and the rest of my party arriving, the wait staff was generous enough to state the specials of the day and some of the favorites on the menu.  One of these best items on the lunch menu was pigs in the garden (salad with pulled pork).  You could actually top the salad with any of their meats...I chose brisket.  It was delicious!  After I left and traveled to my next destination, I had noticed that I had forgotten my credit card at the restaurant.  I called them immediately and they let me know they had located it.  To my relief, they stated that they would just send it to my home free of charge.  Great customer service goes a long way and you'll never feel short of it at Jim'n Nick's bar-b-q. I'd highly recommend the visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best Barbeque ever! baby back ribs make your mouth water. Smoked wings are out of this world! Nacho's are to die for. All trimmings are amazing!!! My favorite is the potato salad. And those biscuits OMG! Not one bad thing I can say even the salad is good."}
{"text":"I've been to several Jim'n Nick's restaurants and they are all consistently good. I order the pulled pork, fries, onion rings and coleslaw. I'm sure I've had the brisket at some point but I keep coming back to the pulled pork. Last couple of times, I've ordered the pulled pork plate; plenty of food for one. The onion rings are definitely worth the $2 upcharge - they are huge, crispy and the better stays on! The real reason I keep coming back to these restaurants is the lemon pie. It's huge, it's pucker-y, it's craveable,  it's made right with real whipped cream! I may just go through the drive through today to snatch one up. My only issue with this place is my to go orders are never right. Check your bag and boxes for everything you ordered. One time, I was almost sent out the door without drinks, one time my husband came home without the lemon pie he paid for. Beware. When I've called to get my money back, I was told it would be credited and it wasn't. I know it's just $3.75 plus tax but it's the principle. The service is nothing great; the waiters and hostesses seem bored to be there but they get the job done. Last time, we were getting rushed a bit? Ha, good luck trying to rush me. I am paying for my $20 meal just like anyone else. It wasn't even busy which made it strange. Also - drive through takes a long time, you are better off calling ahead and picking up at the bar. At any rate, next time I'm in the mood for BBQ, you can find me here again! Oh, yeah and the biscuits are great!"}
{"text":"Fries: very good with seasoning spices Barbque : arrived cold, told mgr, brought another plate but it was cold also. And there sauce is not as good Midwood Smokehouse.  Baked beans were plain.  Wait staff: slow & forgetful but nice. When you have to get up & go hunt them down to bring you your tea after you ordered it & you have been sitting there for 20 minutes & THEN you have to go hunt them down to get a refill of your tea after another 20 minutes! And THEN they bring you the wrong side dishes!  AND then they bring you cold barbque for your entree. And then they bring you a replacement plate of cold barbque!  Good grief!"}
{"text":"A group of ladies from my church traveled to Concord, NC from Lynchburg, VA for a ladies night out weekend. Someone in our group recommended Jim'N Nicks for dinner. Getting a clear answer on the phone as to whether or not I could make a reservation, etc., was slightly difficult and took about 15 minutes. However, when we arrived everything was perfect. The manager came to me with any questions or concerns since I was the coordinator and held enough seats for all the women. We had roughly 25 women show up for dinner. The waiters and waitresses were very nice, friendly, and quick. One order was incorrect, but it was quickly corrected. I would go back for sure! A big thank you to the manager and everyone who helped us out!"}
{"text":"Service here is great and the food comes out exceptionally fast- sometimes so fast that there's not even enough time to enjoy the free cheese biscuits. Smoked meats always come out tender, juicy, and delicious. I'd especially recommend the chicken, which is possibly the most tender chicken I've ever had. Side dishes are generally good as well, especially the mac and cheese and green beans."}
{"text":"Possibly the best onion rings on the planet. Hubby and I both had pulled pork (sandwich for me) and it was delicious and ample. Server Drew was friendly and helpful. Can wait to return to try other menu items"}
{"text":"Omg to the biscuits they bring to the pork BBQ. Everything was so good! I have been searching and searching for good pork BBQ. I am originally from MD and my Grandfather (whom passed away) always made NC style BBQ for us growing up. He was raised in Greenville NC, his BBQ had no BBQ sauce just a vinegar base and when someone in my family doesn't cook it, I normally don't like it. Well, I found a place that tastes the closest to my Granddad's BBQ and it is Jim and Nick's. I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anyone. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"We have tried several \"hole in the wall\" BBQ joints around Charlotte. Alot of them are good and kind of pricey. Jim N Nicks is better and cheaper, so.... We love the platters, collards and mac. The cheesy biscuits are crazy awesome! This place has become a staple for us."}
{"text":"Good barbeque, but they always seem to be out of baby back ribs. Also the prices online are not reflective of what we were charged. When asked about this, they refused to take responsibility for pricing differences in the online menus. Of course everything was more expensive..."}
{"text":"I organized a group to eat here and initially called ahead for 20. They already had tables ready for us when we arrived (15 minutes early), and the service was outstanding even as our group swelled to about 30 (all ordering entrees, drinks, etc.) as the evening progressed. Our primary server was Dana, and she was outstanding. The food was OK (I think most people were pleased, though my grilled chicken was extremely salty), and the price was a little on the high end for the atmosphere & food quality. I'd prefer Sticky Fingers or Texas Roadhouse (2 other nearby chain restaurants) over Jim n Nicks as better values (and with better food), but the quality of the service may bring me back to try the food again."}
{"text":"Great BBQ dive!  Menu is definitely made up of comfort foods, cooked the way my grandmother would have seasoned it!  Awesome Chicken BBQ.  Husband loves the fried green tomatoes!  You should try it if BBQ and comfort foods are your thing!  Note* Read the labels on the BBQ sauce bottles at your table.  I grabbed habanero thinking it was sweet southern because of the color.  WRONG!  Fortunately I had not put too much on my chicken before the realization set in."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times for lunch and dinner. I really enjoy the pig in the garden salad and the pulled pork nachos. Ribs are also a favorite with a side of Mac n cheese.  Recently I ordered catering from them. I had 30 people and it worked out to be about 8 bucks a person. Everyone raved about the food and I will definitely have them cater my next meeting."}
{"text":"Oh em gee! This place is amazing! The food, the service, the prices - everything is perfect!  I used to frequent the Steele Creek location but stopped working in that area and haven't been there since. I went recently with my son for lunch after finding out they're so close to home.  My son and I came during the lunch rush and were lucky to immediately get an open seat. Our waiter was very kind and got our drinks right away. The food came out shortly after - not much of a wait which is awesome cause we were hungry!  You're given complimentary corn biscuits which are slightly sweet and so addictive! The texture is a little glutinous and slightly chewy - not the flaky texture you'd expect from a biscuit. But that's what I like about It.  I ordered the pork plate while my son ordered the double decker which is a three tier sandwich with both pork and brisket since he couldn't decide between the two. The pork was tender and moist with a hint of smoke flavor. There's bbq sauces on the table if you like It saucy but I like the pork flavor on its own. My son, however, doused his meats with the habanero sauce. Now onto the sides - the Mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy with a nice baked cheese crust on top. Just a dash of black pepper added to compliment the cheese. And the collard greens? Amazing! I throw a little Tabasco on top cause I like the heat and acid but even without the hot sauce, the collards greens are amazing! Collards is a big deal to me. If it's on the menu, I always order It. If the greens aren't good, that's an indication on the restaurant in its entirety. In this case, they are perfect!  My son and I spent our lunch oohing and ahhhing each bite we took. There were NO leftovers- we cleaned our plates even though we were stuffed with the large portions. It was so good, we ordered corn biscuits to go and also bought a jar of the habanero bbq sauce. My son has thrown that sauce on every meat I've cooked at home and has now requested this place for his bday dinner in a couple weeks."}
{"text":"I went there last night, and I can say it was amazing. When you walk in, the smoky barbecue smell just hits you. The service was incredible, as they were incredibly accommodating to the vegetarian in my large party. The food was wonderful, in particular, we enjoyed the cornbread muffins served at the beginning and all the different kinds of barbecue. Between my party, we ordered; pulled chicken, pulled pork, sausages, brisket, and the baby back ribs. All of them get high marks! Overall this is a great comfortable place to enjoy some music and great food."}
{"text":"You will scream and shout with joy!!  Best bbq joint I've ever tried.  The Carolina pulled pork sandwich is so incredible I almost fell off my chair. It's not super sweet like some other bbq places which overload their bbq sauce with sugars. This is true vinegar based Carolina BBQ and truly delectable.  It's topped with the most deliciously flavored and spicy pickles, I was in heaven!  Every time I return to NC trust me I'll be returning.  I highly recommend to everyone!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to eat.  I had family from out of town and took them to this restaurant just last night.  I love the customer service you receive and I love the food.  No matter what you get you will not be disappointed.  I so need a tshirt.  Don't change and you will keep our business.  Love the fact that we were checked on by staff several times!!!"}
{"text":"Average food at best and the service drops it another star.  I've been here twice, as well as other locations, and they are all the same.  No reason to go again."}
{"text":"This was our first time to eat here for lunch, and we had been wanting to try a new BBQ restaurant in NC while we were traveling.  Overall, the meat (brisket, turkey, chicken)had a good flavor and was tender.  The mini cheese biscuits that were served before our meal were really tasty, and the collards were seasoned and cooked just right as well.  The 2-meat meal with 2 sides came with good sized meat portions; however, the 3-meat meal with 2 sides came with much smaller portions.  Another good thing about our visit was that we received a 10% military discount off the total price of our bill.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive, kept our beverages topped off, and even gave us drinks to go!"}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at Sticky Fingers the other night, I returned to Jim N Nicks to fulfill my BBQ craving. Service was great, as always, as was the food. The pulled pork nachos are awesome. I also got the loaded baked potato and had a bite of my husband's ribs. Now these are some ribs, unlike the skinny ones I had at Sticky Fingers the other night. I was a little disappointed that they no longer serve creamed spinach, and that it is now creamed collards. I do not like collard greens, but my mom had them.  There was not a point where we did not have food on the table. The nachos came out pretty quickly and our entrees started coming out as we were finishing them up. Our waitress apologized profusely for the delay in the cheese biscuits, but it really wasn't a problem for me. The manager also stopped by to see how we were doing and also apologized for the biscuits taking so long.. ??  I know they're great and all, but really, it's fine. Lol.  You could see they had a great sense of teamwork there. If someone was walking by and saw an empty plate, they would grab it, or refill our drinks. That's something I can really appreciate.   The pecan pie is amazing. I did not order any tonight, but when I do, I just get the whole pie. There is a manager who usually gives us a slice for free and sticks around to chat a little while. I was sad I didn't get to see him tonight.  We don't come here often as I normally don't have that BBQ craving, but when I do, this is definitely my go-to place."}
{"text":"I love Jim n Nicks but his location has a vey slow drive thru, we waited about 20 minutes at 4pm on a weekday when the parking lot was empty.  They also didn't give us the right items."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal here, did take out via drive thru, less than 5 minutes from order until ready.  Family meal, Pulled pork was great, not fatty two large sides, perfectly cooked and seasoned greens, little kick to them and rich delicious Mac and cheese, 12 cheese biscuits $30.  Enough for 4 meals.  Love this place, wish I still lived nearby."}
{"text":"Barbecue here is really different from what we have in CN, you don't have the chance to cook for your own, which is more convenient but has less fun. Carolina style pork is soooo delicious, wish I could eat more. They also serve awesome cakes instead of bread! Ok it's wierd that you won't get a free desert for your BD here while almost all the restaurants in US do. But nice BBQ as a whole"}
{"text":"02/25/17, around 8:30 p.m.  Wow. First two times I was here - excellent food and service. Went through the drive-thru both times. I will say the last time I went they were out of potatoes and mashed potatoes....on a Saturday night? There are a considerable amount of grocery stores right in the area - get off your butts and go to the store? They're just starting out though, so gave them a pass and had the cole slaw instead (kind of bland, not a lot of dressing on it).  But this last time. Sigh. Placed my order - a single Carolina Pork Dinner with two sides of Mac & Cheese (one for me, one for the dogs for their dinner). :P I waited in line for 25 minutes, with three cars ahead of me. Watched the first two cars, and they had huge orders that they could have been told to pull around for. But no - we had to wait for that. Person in front of me, small order, in and out. My order, in and out. People behind me bailed because they were sick of waiting.  Got to the window, and the person there was soooooooo slow and not at all interested in moving people along through a drive-thru. I watched her fill my lemonade when I pulled up (what was she doing with her spare time until I pulled up - we've been waiting here 25 minutes!!). She sees me pull up, doesn't bother to take my money or give me my drink. Takes her time putting my meal into a bag and then opens the window. I give her my card, still no drink; yet I see it sitting right there. She gives me my card back and wanders off for a couple minutes. Finally comes back and hands me my drink (hello?) and then my meal. Really, really bad customer experience.  When I got my order home, two Mac & Cheese on the side - my pups were happy. I like their Mac & Cheese and it was good. Opened the main container - a very sad looking pile of meat (which I found out was laced with fat that was inedible), two cheese biscuits, and two Carolina sauces thrown in. No liner like there always is. This meal was NOT worth the $18.00+ that I was charged. I will try City BBQ instead.   Additional note: On the past visits, I've been given a receipt and have been encouraged to fill it out for a 'free appetizer'. Filled a previous one out, and now this one. No code for an app or any response via email. Yes, I've checked my Junk mail. Don't give people receipts and tell them they will get something for filling out a survey if you're not going to deliver.  Pretty much done with this business. :/ Sad, because they do have excellent BBQ. Their service and follow up via surveys is abysmal."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the cornbread cheesy muffins with real corn are yummy!!!!!  I had the 2 meat plate with a salad and collards.  I've never had collards before, so I don't know if they were good.  I did not enjoy them, but I really did try.  Yuk.  They are definitely different.  Maybe if they were fresh, but they seemed canned.  I don't know, I just won't get them again.  There's not much I don't like, but I'm adding them to my list.  I had bone in chicken and beef brisket.  Both were good and the portions are amazingly large.  I had enough to take home for the next days lunch.  The white barbecue sauce is interesting.  It's not bad, it's totally different.  I think there's mustard in it and I could taste the vinegar but I couldn't decipher any other indicative tastes.  I didn't bring it home.  The haberno BBQ is hotttttttt!  It burned my mouth, I drank a whole glass of water.  If you've got a big appetite, come on over for some good BBQ."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great food and service! They give you little cheese biscuits. They're actually light and airy and a little sweet. You can buy the mix.  I had the pulled pork. It was great. Their hot sauce is HOT!!! Use with caution! But I like heat so it was great! My uncle had the half chicken special, and my aunt had the ribs. I will definitely come back here on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Chicken was undercooked and the Pulled Pork wasn't all that. It was bland tasting. The waiter was nice and attentive, but the food is overrated and not that good."}
{"text":"We are there at least two times a week love the food and the service everything is wonderful especially the coconut pie"}
{"text":"I would have never went here if it wasn't for a family member recommending this spot being that I don't eat pork. But I realized I have been missing out due to the fact that the non pork menu items we ordered were soooo good.  For starters the complimentary cheese muffins are delicious. I could just go for them alone. We ordered the beef brisket nachos to start with they were delicious, even my picky 3 year old enjoyed them. My main course was the smoked buffalo wings, I love the smoked flavor in every bite. The buffalo flavor is on the mildly spicy side. I also had a side of fries. My Fiancé got the fully loaded minus the bacon beef brisket baked potato. He also enjoyed his but had to take a good portion to go since it's extremely filling.  The staff was friendly and attentive. I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Yes I've had better. Here in NC. Even at BBQ joints in the strip mall. Its my second time dining here. The first wasn't very good at all and here we are three months later for our second shot. And just like last time I left most of my food on the plate, no Togo box needed. Tonight I tried the three meat combo with two sides. Classic pulled pork, smoked chicken and smoked turkey. Mac n cheese and coleslaw for the sides. I liked the Mac n cheese. The rest I did not like. At all. The meats were cold. The pork was bland with a lil too much fat. And I'll eat fat if it's tasty. The chicken had something off about the texture. It was dry as was the turkey. Both white meat. The coleslaw has too much pepper and not enough creme. The house BBQ sauce I did not care for. Too spicy but without the sweetness that spicy sauce should have.   Now being a northerner I can see where you'd dismiss my review as he don't know no better. But I do. I like Hillbilly's off 85 in McFadden and I like Lakeview BBQ in the strip mall on highway 16 in Denver NC. I know good BBQ. I can't say it was here at Jim n nicks.   Shame too cuz the layout n decor here is great. My server tonight was 4 stars as was his manager. They even took my meal off the bill when they saw how much I was leaving on the plate. But I gotta review the food honestly. Right?"}
{"text":"We were out riding the motorcycles and looking for a place to have lunch. We just happened to come by this place and want to delightful surprise it was. We were seated quickly and our server was absolutely amazing. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and the great suggestions.v her service was fast and efficient and her personality was absolutely wonderful. Our food came out fast and it was cooked perfectly and it tasted great. This is definitely a place I would return to everything was above and beyond expectations."}
{"text":"This is our third time eating at Jim and Nick's and we have loved it each time. Their pork barbecue is some of the best in the area and the potato salad is always good. The bar has been on each time also. Great food and a good price! Restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Cold food and service was not good!  Will not be back the prices are high for the area"}
{"text":"Slow service, cold food, and overall experience was not satisfactory. This was our second visit and we will not be back."}
{"text":"This pains me to write - as I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this place.  The corn bread muffins have gotten so many insane reviews that it was the ONLY reason I wanted to go to this place one Sunday afternoon. Now - onto the disappointing part: Perhaps it was the time of day that we went to the Indian Land location (It was around 4 p.m.), but the staff literally ALL treated us as if we were bothering them.... or as if we owed them a million apologies for being patrons. There was one waitress that stood out from the crowd and was remarkably helpful, but she wasn't waiting on our table. That said, the food was mediocre. Our yummy corn muffins came out cold with a delivery message of, \"these are fresh out of the oven\" (no, they were NOT). They really aren't good if they're not hot..... I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and when the delivery was a burger with bacon, the woman seemed completely annoyed with me. I profusely apologized, noted it definitely wasn't mine and she kept asking, \"are you sure\" - uh... yes, I know what I ordered. When she came back a few minutes later (clearly with the same cold fries and a new burger) she said, \"I understand you didn't want the bacon\" - the mushroom Swiss burger doesn't come with bacon!! Wow. What a way to treat customers in a way that makes them want to come back ~ geez. When we asked for more corn muffins, we received a noteworthy fresh, hot batch. MUCH MUCH better. Upon leaving, we were all soured with the service that we really couldn't tell you how the rest of the food was. Our child was enamored with the Mac & cheese, but he said the French fries were ice cold and not-tasty enough for his young taste buds. I really hope they pull it together. Their location is great - (especially to pull away from the Ballantyne crowd) and I know the Steele Creek location has tremendous service. Fingers crossed, but I can assure we won't be back for at least a few months."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, everything I've tried is fantastic! The baked beans and collared greens are amazing !!  Grilled chicken breast platter, beef brisket sandwich are my favorites ."}
{"text":"We are out of towners from California.  We YELP'd this place and we scored!!  Best BBQ in town!  Off the hook desserts too!!!  They gave the most friendly service ever!  This place is a MUST EAT!!!  Excellent"}
{"text":"Spare ribs are a bit over cooled and I'm not getting a lot of smoke flavor.  Pulled pork is good but want more bark.  Like the brisket just wish it wasn't sauced already.   Collards are good! So is mac n cheese."}
{"text":"We get catering from jim n nicks at work fairly often. Great quality food. Their bbq pork is ok but the bbq chicken is really good. Sides are good as well. Spicy bbq sauce is actually spicy and flavorful. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ in this area. Tried for the first time last week. Service was also excellent.   Brisket sandwich amazing..mac and cheese definitely from scratch. Their food is all fresh never frozen  Definitely top notch!"}
{"text":"If you are a Texas style bbq fan then this is your place , they do have a \"Carolina\" bbq selection but it's not anything like the Carolina bbq I grew up on, however; it's still yummy. The chedder muffins given before you start eating your entrees are delicious ."}
{"text":"We went between lunch and dinner, service was great.  The food was fresh, hot and very good.  I had a combo of brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was great although I prefer to sauce it myself.  I'm sure they would put it on the side.  Speaking of sauce, the spicy was very good.  The chopped pulled pork was great, not full of fat, great mixture of bark and tender meat.  Sides were good and the banana pudding was very good.  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We order take out from here all the time, still love the food but about 1 out of 5 times do they get the order correct. It's really annoying that they never can it right. Last week I went to the drive through and waited over 20 minutes!!! that is way too long and not convenient. And after telling the order several times and even asking when I received they still did not get it right. I mean I repeated myself 3 times and then asked and the exact words were \"I put it in myself.\" clearly they didn't because it wasn't there. If you can't take carry out correctly then I would suggest not doing it."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best bbq places in the entire city. They're always packed at all times but the waiting time is actually pretty decent. The longest I had to wait was about 10 minutes and it was PACKED. Servers were all over the place and even the manager and hostess were waiting tables, and even the place being crazy busy. Service was amazing, we didn't have to wait long for our food and the servers were always on top of everything.  I took my in laws to this place when they were in town and they absolutely LOVED it. They live in another country, and they're always saying next time they come back the first place they want to come visit is this place. My father in law has a very special palate, and the restaurant accommodated to his requests.   Also they carry the white zombie Catawba beer, and that's the only beer I absolutely can drink until I pass out. The ribs are to die for, the Cuban sandwich is mouth watering, all the trimmings are delicious but the best ones are the buffalo fries, Mac and cheese and the baked beans. Banana pudding for desert please  I've been to this place multiple times, and not a single time hey have let me down. I absolutely and totally loved it. I think this place would LITERALLY kill all the other BBQ places in the city if they had a more centric location. This is by far the best BBQ place in the entire Charlotte metro area."}
{"text":"Love everything I've had here but my fav is the baked potato with pulled pork....da bomb."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative number I most certainly would!  I am a mother of three who decided to take dad out to eat for Father's Day. I wish that I would have went to the grocery store, went to the meat market for some good steaks, came home and cooked those steaks, cleaned all those dishes and cleaned up the house INSTEAD!!! Hubby had the ribs. He only ate one of the bones. I had Mac and cheese as one of my sides and it had no flavor and it was powdery. My mother in law had the ribeye. It was not a good cut steak. Certainly a previously frozen steak. I just want to say....\"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!\" Wasted $76 dollars on nothing!!! Def not worth $76. Better quality and food for your money at The Smoke Pit!!! Go there!"}
{"text":"I've been here several more times since my first opening review and I stand by the 3 stars still. The barbecue is excellent, no doubt there, other aspects could use some attention. The drive-thru is almost unbearably frustrating every time I have been in it. I know it isn't fast food but the speed has to get better. It is unacceptable to sit at the speaker for more than a few seconds, let alone several minutes before being acknowledged. The drive-thru experience in total is going to potentially be a 20+ minute investment, unfortunately.  The sides also could use some work. Mac n cheese is pretty good, still wishing for fried okra though."}
{"text":"Possibly the best BBQ in Charlotte! Great staff, really friendly. Their Carolina pork is excellent. A good helping for the money. All around a great choice."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday with hubby and 2 kids. My husband had the BBQ plate and I had the combo sandwich with pulled pork and beef brisket while my 3 yr old had chicken nuggets and fries.  Food came out pretty fast and we were very excited to see our plates landed on the table as we were famished! But, what a disappointment. My husband's collards and Mac n cheese trimmings were microwaved! So was my mashed potatoes and my lil ones chicken nuggets. :(  No wonder the food came out lightning fast! I've worked in the restaurant too so I am positive when the food is reheated in a microwave. The cheese in the pasta was rubbery and couldn't even eat it. The BBQ tasted good,tho. So was the complimentary cheese biscuits. Our server was nice. Nothing memorable, seemed annoyed that we were there. I don't know if we will be back, it was our first time and were really disappointed. We had high hopes due to the reviews. Maybe we went in on a bad Monday afternoon, if there's such a thing."}
{"text":"The best barbeque by far. The service is great, and the food is even better. Coming on taco Tuesday is a great idea. They serve some of the best bbq tacos. Also, the banana pudding is phenomenal! I come to this restaurant at least two times a week. Definitely recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and food, they have it down!!!!! Thank you :)   The prime rib is the best!"}
{"text":"I gave this five stars because Jim n Nick's meets and exceeds expectations for what it is supposed to be. This is a BBQ. place, not a fancy dinner place. That said, the food is excellent- every time. The service is lively and entertaining (I always sit at the bar with friends), expedient and proactive. Love the BBQ, the smoked chicken (excellent on a salad), fried catfish (don't recommend the grilled), stuffed potatoes and of course the delicious warm cheese muffins they give you as soon as you get there. Decent beer selection, enviable bourbon/whiskey selection. Bar is too small and it's loud like a BBQ place should be. Patio is nice in the spring and fall.   Now I'm hungry, may have to visit the drive through (oh yeah, they have a window... Did your waist just find it too convenient to grow? . Good stuff."}
{"text":"Wow. Super slow service. We were there for almost an hour and a half. The food took forever to come out. There was some sort of argument/drama going on with the cooks. The food was just ok. It felt like eating at a chain restaurant. Bonus points for having White Zombie on draft though."}
{"text":"Placed a takeout order but I was really bummed to find out no cheesy cornbread in bag. That's our favorite part! Food was good otherwise."}
{"text":"I don't always love to eat BBQ but this place is a mess. The food is dry, the staff is rude, The restrooms are dirty and nasty. Please avoid this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to visit this restaurant since moving to the area a few months ago. It was just ok. I was disappointed overall, I expected much better, especially for the price. The brisket was good, but the ribs were barely ok. Fixings were not that great either. I don't know that we will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing steak and BBQ! Their Mac n cheese is delicious  They have cheese cornbread muffins to start off your experience.  All their sauces are great! The best bbq sauce IMO is their Habanéro Bar-B-Q Sauce."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something different and decided to give this place a shot.  I did a pick up order of a bbq burger with a side of mac and cheese. And an order of banana pudding.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  The burger was really good and i loved their BBQ sauce.  The mac and cheese wasnt the best I've had, but it was good.  And i loved their banana pudding.  Their portion was huge too.  I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"It's kind of silly for me to say but I think one of the best things here are the CORN BREAD CHEESY BISCUITS they start you out with. I can eat them all day! They are so good and it comes to you in a little basket hot from the oven and freshly baked. You can't just have one... I dare you!   Although this is not the best BBQ I had, it does stand out from a lot of the ones I have tried. I ordered the \"Double Decker\" sandwich, which comes with pulled pork and beef brisket between buns, and served with one scratch-made trimming (side item) for $9.29. It was a good amount of food so I didn't even finish my fries. I really liked their \"authentic Habanero (spelling is correct!)\" Bar-BQ sauce too, it gave my sandwich quite a kick!  I came with a large group of people and the waitresses took real good care of us the entire meal. I was surprised how quickly they took all of our orders and delivered it us too. On top of that we all had separate checks and they delivered in a timely fashion. We made sure they got tipped a decent amount, especially the one with the awesome sense of humor.   I would say that even though this isn't my favorite BBQ joint, I would come back here again."}
{"text":"On vacation from Florida to visit the Great Wolf Lodge. This restaurant is within walking distance of the resort. We wanted to try out some NC bar-B-Q so we decided on this place because of the location. Walked in around 6:30pm. No waiting. Very few people. (This should have been a clue).  Server nice but not very attentive ( had to ask other servers for drink refills, napkins etc). Tried to order the beef brisket and hot links platter but NO-GO. They ran out. So we settled on pulled pork, ribs and a kid's chicken tender platter. Meat came out cold which they replaced in a timely fashion.  But overall the food was not that great. The highly seasoned collards and cabbage side dishes were very salty. The fries not very crispy. And the meat tasted bland. We tried to add barbecue sauce but it was not good as well. Sorry, but this is not good eating.  Yes, edible but not great tasting.  The food at the lodge was  much better."}
{"text":"The cheese muffins are amazing! We went here with a huge party of people for my daughters first birthday, our server was very reserved but he was great and attentive. We order a couple of the huge platters (it's a quite a bit of food!) food was delicious and the prices were fair! I don't know how I missed this place before! Must try!"}
{"text":"I brought one of my employees here for her birthday. I talked up all the cheesy biscuits. However, they said they prefer red lobster biscuits. Honestly I think it was a preference as they did acknowledge they were very tasty. Considering the fact they brought some home with them as leftovers speaks volumes.   Nevertheless, we enjoyed every entrée from catfish, loaded mac & cheese, classic pull pork and a piggy in the patch. I kept hearing how great the Mac and cheese was over and over. When comments are heard like \"that is so cheesy\" and you are not watching a bad romantic comedy then I think you have a winner!   I have been to Jim and Nicks before and every time is unique and enjoyable. I think I will visit more often!   If you like BBQ go ahead and give it a try ! I think you will enjoy and if not at least you got free smells!"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! Fresh, tasty and delicious! All the servers are happy because all the patrons love the food! You will enjoy every bite! Sweet eating!"}
{"text":"An easy go-to if you're not a BBQ snob.   It's not the best I've ever had, but it's certainly passable BBQ and ranks in the top 10 for Charlotte BBQ places.   Pretty affordable with dinner+drink running you about $12-15. Hidden gem here is the drink specials which are sometimes too good to be true. A few friends and I split a bottle of wine for 3 bucks each, which doesn't get any better.  The true standout is their biscuits. I'd come and eat only those, to my own detriment. I know you'll ask for seconds of them."}
{"text":"Wow! Great meat and lots of side kick choices. It took me awhile to decide what to have. The waitress even gave us side samples to help us decide what to choose. Great Customer Service here!   I soled the chili and Brunswick stew , my son sampled the slaw and potato salad, my husband the Mac and cheese.  Let me tell you the chili and Brunswick stew are so filling they could be be a meal on their own. Full of meat, butter beans, and tomatoes the Brunswick stew was a bit too hearty for me, not enough broth. Chili has beef brisket, jalapeño, and it delicious but could fill you up, so be careful if ordering.  I got the wedge salad with beef brisket on top. Included with cherry tomatoes, purple onion, bacon, and fresh blue cheese dressing.  It was good, but not the best ever. My husband got the beef brisket ate with Mac n cheese and fries. He said fries were ok, but Mac and cheese awesome. My son got the Cuban sandwich with Mac and cheese, awesome, slaw that was med cut and super tasty, and potato salad, has strong sweet relish taste with mustard and a bit too like mashed potato salad for me, but he enjoyed it. It's all up to individual taste.   Overall, fantastic experience . Clean dining room. Super friendly staff and management checked on our satisfaction twice.  Highly recommend trying this BBQ joint.  Only downer was the bathroom. Needed cleaning. Trash was overflowing, ugh. It was dinner time and it looked way too full."}
{"text":"Best BBQ pulled pork sandwich I have eaten! The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Nice atmosphere and great prices.  This is my new favorite Spot in NC!"}
{"text":"Such a delicious brisket and pulled pork served here. Nice hickory style setting interior and beautiful BBQ served here. Friendly staffs and nice vibe. Carolina pulled port was amazing. I I'll come back again"}
{"text":"Outstanding Southern barbecue with a touch of upscale appeal. First let's distinguish that it is definitely Carolina style barbecue, meaning the vinegar and pepper, as opposed to the molasses sweet sauces you'll find other places.  Also worth mentioning is that everything in the place is from scratch. The appetizer of three deviled eggs taste like the ones you get from your favorite neighbor at the local cookout, the baked beans seem like they have been simmered all day long and the highlight of mini cheese biscuits are subtly sweet and as fluffy as the day is long. Onion rings were light, crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. Just perfect.  The pig on a bun, a traditional pork sandwich is an easy staple, and for a twist, try the barbecue pork nachos. If you don't love pork, try the turkey with the white poultry/barbecue sauce. My husband was dipping everything he could into do it.  Great selection of drinks, with a highlight on whiskey/bourbons.  Their homemade lemonade is amazing. Try it mixed in with some of their homemade sweet tea for a very memorable Arnold Palmer. For dessert, the banana pudding is thick and full of flavor - tasted like my mama's. We came here twice in two days and both servers we had, one for dinner and one for lunch, were just as nice as could be and honest about their opinions of the food and how we should order.  I truly wish I had one in my home city of Jacksonville, Florida. But I am looking forward to any road trip I take in the south that comes near a Jim'n Nick's. Wow!"}
{"text":"Great food and really nice service. Ribeye is always a favorite for us. The bread for the table is to die for. The collard greens, beans and macaroni and cheese are my favessssssssss."}
{"text":"Really GOOD BBQ!  Especially for a franchise.  The original Jim N Nicks is in Birmingham, Alabama and as they've added locations, they teach the local Pittmasters how to replicate on site the beef, pork, and chicken BBQ smoked over hickory in the original store.  Everything is prepared on site daily. There is definitely an Alabama flavor to the bbq here, including the white BBQ sauce (on the side).     I had the brisket which was outstanding! ($8.00)  Very tender with a great smokey flavor.  I didn't even add any sauce!  I'm looking forward to going back to try their pork BBQ.  Based on the brisket, it will be great.    They have a good range of items on their menu in addition to the beef, pork, and chicken BBQ.  Also on the menu are smoked sausage, smoked turkey, ribs, and Brunswick Stew.    Very nice decor with excellent service.  The prices are higher than the typical BBQ joint around these parts, but compare pretty favorably to other chain restaurants.  Certainly worth a try if you want to venture out from Trafitional NC BBQ."}
{"text":"Look forward to returning!  I asked if they can bring me lean beef brisket and they delivered. Loved it. Daughter, 14, liked the pulled pork. Potato salad and collards were much better than I expected. While a chain this was good. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better restaurants in Steele Creek.   Hands down, the top reason to come here is for the complementary cheesey biscuits/muffins. I easily eat at least 5 every time I come and leave unable to move. They are warm, gooey, fresh out of the oven, and are my favorite complimentary item in the city. It's impossible to resist them.   Moving on to the rest of the food... The barbecue is pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about. My favorite thing to get is the loaded mac and cheese on their lunch menu -- mac and cheese topped with pulled pork. It's a pretty delicious combination. It's not on the dinner menu, but all but one time, my waiter has let me order it anyway when I asked.   The service is usually pretty fast as lunch even if it's crowded. On Friday's at lunch it does get pretty busy.   All in all, this is a solid choice for a meal. It's definitely better than most of what you'll find in the area."}
{"text":"Craving bbq, I decided to go here solo. Was going to go sit at the bar when I saw the drive thru and took my antisocial self thru there instead. (Okay, I'm not antisocial at all, just had a moment) the person who took my order was very pleasant and spoke clearly, I appreciate that! I ordered the pulled pork plate with Mac and cheese and a side salad in addition to a sweet tea and 2 cheese biscuits. I was shocked when it came to $19. But of course was willing to pay since I ordered all I did and this was the first time there. Pulled to the window, the young lady working was very pleasant. I got my food quickly and headed home. The sweet tea was perfect! The bbq was good. Now the Mac and cheese was lacking something. Couldn't place my finger on what it was lacking. The side salad was good too, my only complaint was I asked the person when I ordered if the salad came with bacon because I don't eat bacon, she said no but when I got home there was bacon bits. Not a big deal, just had to pick them out. The cheese biscuits were awesome! Overall, I think the price is a little steep compared to other bbq places but didn't feel buyers remorse after. So that's a plus. I'll more than likely return and experience the inside vs. the drive thru."}
{"text":"On vacation from South Fl, stopped in for the incredible cheese biscuits I read about. No lie best biscuits I've ever had. Baked to perfection, I was in honey butter cheese biscuit heaven.  As for the reviews I read about the servers, have to admit our waitress, Dana, was really nice and sweet. Even for a small hiccup we had were she forgot to bring the sweet tea after asking twice she owned up to it and brought it out right away. She was great though, had great suggestions about the food.  Now as for the food, just like the biscuits the food was just as great. I ordered the lunch loaded Mac n Cheese with BBQ pork and side of coleslaw. The coleslaw complimented the pork like they were meant for each other, it was so yummy.   My boyfriend ordered the double decker meal as per the suggestion of our waitress. Its supposed to be sandwich like meal but she suggested to have the buns on the side so the meat is on the plate and the sides. He had pulled pork and brisket. The pulled pork was moist and great with the sauce, I myself tried the brisket, I'm not a huge brisket person it's too dry for me, but he really liked it had great flavor just like the pork. The sides were Mac n cheese and baked beans, both delicious.  Lastly Dana brought me out a chocolate cream pie it was perfect, I had never had one before and I will say Best dessert ever, the chocolate wasn't too overpowering and blended well with the whipped cream.  Leaving here, I'm here kicking myself in the butt for coming to such a delicious restaurant that I have no where near me back home."}
{"text":"When you want real southern BBQ this is the place. We had a variety of sides and BBQ. Everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE everything about this place!  And be sure to save room for dessert.  Every pie on the menu is worth its weight in calorie consumption.  I'm that girl that orders a slice to eat there and a pie to go home with."}
{"text":"Steele Creek, you gotta eat inside or call ahead & carry out. Drive thru just not the same. Kinda weird but it's true."}
{"text":"Now we're talking. We've been 3 more times and each time has been great.  The early kinks seemed to have been worked out and we love this place.  Taken friends twice now. Best place around for BBQ"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ. Ordered the onion rings, which were made from scratch, as is everything in this joint.  That was a big reason I came here instead of the nearby Sonny's and Zaxby's.  Had the ribs, some pulled chicken, and their hot links.  Ribs were really good.  They ran out of the regular ribs, and could only give the baby backs.  Couldn't even get to the links.  Peach sangria good also.  This place closed early at 9:00.  Service very friendly."}
{"text":"Went to Jim & Nicks  few months back and ordered a salad.  We got home and both were not made properly as requested.  I called that night and although I forgot who I spoke with, I was told to come back so they could make it right.  We didn't go back for a while because we just never made it down to that direction.  We had to go to Lowes in Indian Land tonight, so we thought about it and decided to request the replacement salads tonight.  When I mentioned the incident to the young lady at the take out, she seemed as if she didn't believe us which I didn't really like as I am sure she recognized us since she has handled our order a few times.  She waited for me to say, \"can we just speak with a Manager\", instead of offering to get one in the first place.  Nevertheless, she disappeared and went and got the Manager.  Eric heard us and was very cordial.  He not only made the dinner salads for us, but he made sure that we had what we needed this time.  He was very pleasant and took the time to make sure we were satisfied.  I appreciated his diligence as we certainly would never try to just get a free salad.    I only gave three stars because of the young lady in take-out, but also as I was eating the salad, I bit into a rotten tomato, it was brown and tasted horrible.  I was afraid to eat the other tomatoes but actually the rest of the salad was pretty good.  I have to comment on the cook who helped us last time we were there and took time to speak with us and made us feel very welcome."}
{"text":"I am definitely a BBQ snob having been spoiled growing up here and going to college in Alabama. I've eaten barbecue all over the south from gas stations to high end restaurants and it's one of my favorite dishes along with the sides that accompany it. Being a franchise chain, I was very skeptical but boy, was I impressed. Their smoked chicken is amazing as is their pork. I wish that I could remember the name of the smoker that they used as one of their managers had told us about it. The meat didn't even need any sauce! The meat from the ribs literally falls clean off the. One and has a wonderful flavor- and I'm not a rib eater! They have 2 kinds of pork to choose from. I do love their Alabama white sauce which is a fabulous vinegar, mayonnaise, and black pepper condiment that was spot on. The sides were great and the onion rings are wonderful as well. I believe that we may have eaten our weight in their cheddar biscuits. I have a major sweet tooth and we tried their peanut butter pie. That's one of my favorite desserts but this one had more homemade whipped cream than peanut butter filling.  It's worth the visit. Just don't fill up on the biscuits!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, price was good! What else could you ask for. I have been to several different locations and have always had a good experience. Also if you find yourself at this location say hi to the Manager his name is Tim he is awesome. You will know it's him by his energy, the way he walks, how he talks etc. Keep rocking Jim 'n Nick's!"}
{"text":"Holy moly come hungry. I ordered the baked tater with pork... it was HUGE and really yummy.. not healthy by any stretch. We also ordered the brisket sandwich, I didn't care for the brisket but BF said it was ok... the mac and cheese was super good and the biscuits were excellent."}
{"text":"I decided to try this out because it was located next to the dentist office I had an appointment with. They had a lunch special that included barbeque  macaroni & cheese, & mashed potatoes for $11.50. I started out with the biscuits that come courtesy to your meal & they were amazing.   The waitress then brought out the barbeque with the two sides immediately after I ordered. I tried the barbeque & wasn't really impressed. The mashed potatoes were okay. The waitress recommended the macaroni & cheese as one of the best sides & I wasn't impressed. It was very bland. Overall this is a three. I did come in right before the lunch crowd got there, so the quality & flavor of the food had nothing to do with it being crowded.   The waitress served me my food & continued to wait on bigger parties. Since I was by myself I don't think I got the service I needed. My drink was almost completely out, I didn't have any napkins, & it took five minutes to get the waitresses attention before I could get a to go box. I would consider this fast food of barbeque for twice the price."}
{"text":"Since we moved to the area we eat at or get take from this place 3 times a month or more. Service is good and manager Tim was friendly and helpful. Good portion sizes and a variety of options. We love the smoked turkey with white sauce. Only complaint is when getting to go or drive thru they look have messed up orders (missing sides/trimmings, missing sauce or not given sauce requested).  Now that I am thinking about it really could go for some Jim N Nicks"}
{"text":"What a find ! Yummy biscuits unlike any I have ever had.  Really good sweet tea. My daughters burger was fantastic. Not that processed stuff real meat. BBQ was really good too! Service was fantastic and were very accommodating of our party to include a service dog. Hostess and waitress was nice. We had a family meal here for $40 that was 10x better than some of the other higher priced places we visited. Will be craving this soon!"}
{"text":"I  love good Barbecue! As I travel around the country, I seek out great barbecue places.... So, when I saw Jim 'n Nick's, I had to give it a try.   Pros:  I found Barbecue and sides that compare with some of the best that I have eaten anywhere. And aside from a very long wait to be seated - even with empty tables clearly visible - service was excellent. Cons:  The foremost con was the prices. Any and all items were priced roughly 50% higher than I have seen at any BBQ eatery that I have visited anywhere in the US. Secondly, the dining room was very crowded and VERY noisy.   Even with the quality of the food... It is hard to reconcile the prices with the atmosphere of a typical BBQ eatery and the too tight passage ways coupled with the level of background noise."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area so we are trying all the places in our area. We LOVE bbq. We come from Texas so we do have high standards. This is our first visit and not only was our server super friendly and prompt, our food came out quickly and it was great! The first thing they bring are little cheddar biscuits and they're amazing. Be careful cause they go down fast and you'll ruin your appetite. My husband had brisket and said it was good. I had the pulled pork on a potato and it was great! The sauces have a smokey vinegar taste and the hot one has a kick for sure. We will definitely be back to try more items."}
{"text":"The environment here is very nice. Staff seemed very friendly and helpful. The cornbread bisquits are AMAZING. Should have just ordered those.  The ribs were probably the worst I've ever had. I ate one and couldn't eat anymore. The texture was off. Too soggy or something. But I think the sauce is what really made it un-eatable. The pulled pork was edible but not too much better. Way to soggy. And not juicy soggy but just like water logged.   Overall very disappointing. I'm a huge BBQ and especially ribs fan, and was thrilled when they were building this place. But will probably never go back. Midwood BBQ down the road is a much better alternative."}
{"text":"Really nice place. We tried almost everything. Pulled pork is moist, and personally my favoriate. The smoked chicken is also good. The beef brisket, carolina style pork, and ribs are a little dry for me, if u like it this way, these two might be better choices. The hot link is way too salty for me. The service is awesome there and I do like the environment."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte! Extensive menu from pulled pork to smoked Turkey and sausage! Mac and cheese is to die for!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous! Super picky with our meats, which is why it doesn't get 5 stars. But it was very good!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!! The food was great. Our server, Emily, was wonderful. She was friendly, fast, and made our dining experience fun.  She should be given a big raise!!! Loved the biscuits and the homemade Mac and cheese was melt in your mouth good. Also loved our pulled pork sandwiches. Can't go wrong by going here."}
{"text":"On a scale of yuck to yum this was a bleh kinda meal.   We were in Concord for a movie down the street and decided to try a new place that we haven't eaten at before. We went during a shift change so when we got seated it was about 10 minutes before anyone came to get our drink orders. But after that the service was great from the bartender that waited on us.   The food was extremely disappointing. We started with the BBQ chips as an appetizer. They were not very good at all. Covered in BBQ flavoring which was way overpowering and extremely salty. It came with a side of blue cheese dressing that was watery.   We ordered the pull pork plates, I got the Carolina Style which was a vinegar based pulled pork. Hubby just got the regular which had a squirt of BBQ sauce on top. We also ordered a couple of sides like cole slaw, fries, baked beans and Mac and cheese. I'll be honest here, the best thing out of the entire meal was the Mac and cheese and the little cheddar biscuits they bring out.   The BBQ was really mushy and lukewarm. I've had better BBQ from fast food restaurants. The beans were piping hope like they'd been nuked in the microwave and the cole slaw was room temperature and dried out. Again, very disappointing food.   May give it another shot at a different time of day and see if it changes anything, but we'll stick with good BBQ that we know when going to Concord from now on."}
{"text":"We arrived the evening of February 18th, 2018 6 P.M.  Waitress was friendly but not very attentive to our party of 6. She spent a lot of time speaking with friends or family seated at a table just a few feet away. My wife was trying to get her attention for at least 10 minutes to ask for a silverware replacement because it was dirty. She wouldn't even turn around. I resorted to self-help. My son's girlfriend's drink had something floating in it. Who ever is in charge of cleaning the dishes needs a refresher course.  After placing our order, the very kind manager came over and told 3 of us that they'd run out of baby back ribs (dinner hour Sunday night). The members of our party had to change.  The meats we had very tasty. I wasn't crazy about any of the sides. The \"fresh fruit\" was not such, and the potato salad was loaded with onions, far too overpowering. Macaroni and cheese was good according to my wife and sons.  This place has much potential but there needs to be some adjustments."}
{"text":"5pm on a Saturday evening and we couldn't think of anything to cook.   I love places that use the Nowait app so I can see how quickly we're moving up the list. Surprisingly, the thirty minute wait we were told was actually about 20. Score!  Our waitress, Jessica, was super friendly and helpful. I could have kissed her for those cheese biscuits she brought to the table. Score #2!  I did a double take because our food arrived so quickly. Score #3!  I love Eastern NC-style BBQ so I decided to try a sandwich and two sides, mac n cheese that I have been craving and collard greens. The food was great. Score #4! My sandwich had just the right amount of 'cue. The mac n cheese was very good, almost as good as mine. The collards were \"ok\". They had more stalk than leaves.   Customer service was wonderful. The manager checked on us when Jessica was busy. Score #5!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Everything I have ordered so far has been awesome. We have always received great service every time we have been no matter what the time or how busy. Everyone that waits tables have always been friendly and has a smile. A wonderful place to go with friends and family."}
{"text":"I have been to this location in Indian land twice.  The food is okay.  It's not great BBQ.  The food is bland   Most good BBQ restaurants you can smell the BBQ cooking on a smoker from blocks away.   Not this one.  No sweet smell of BBQ.   If you are in this area I highly recommend 521 BBQ   It's just a few miles south   Service was okay.   Employees don't seem happy.  In my experience the cause is poor management.    I have eaten at the Jim N Nicks in down town Charlestown.  It is fantastic.   The Indian land location just does not have it all together.    We will not return"}
{"text":"Our favorite BBQ place! A little on the pricy side, but it is soooo good. The ONLY place even remotely close to me that has gluten free BBQ (and I live an hour away). We don't get to eat here much, but when we're in Concord, we usually come here. Staff is always friendly and the food is great.  Went here Friday before a concert. Decided on the half chicken with potato salad and bbq beans. Let me just say that the chicken is absolutely amazing. The best place I had ever had chicken was Texas Roadhouse. But I'd say they definitely have some competition. The chicken was so moist that it was falling off the bone. It's melt in your mouth good. My husband really loves their burgers. He says they're the best he's ever had.  Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Had a great BBQ dinner from Jim n Nick's.  So good. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Double thumbs up."}
{"text":"This is the best brisket I've found in the Carolinas. In from Texas and brisket is a way of life! Lol...the corn muffins are delish too!"}
{"text":"Great Bar*B*Q, the charcoal smell from the parking lot just draws you in. Resistance is futile."}
{"text":"The food is incredible! Never had an issue with the taste of the food. The quickness of the staff is most of the time phenomenal. I've been there a few times, including today, and the service isn't so great. But other times the service is AWESOME. I guess it just depends on your waitstaff. Overall, I'm usually impressed with our visits. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING THAT BREAD"}
{"text":"Love this place for good BBQ! I'm from Texas so I know good BBQ, and this is it. Great brisket! I'm drulling thinking about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Delicious BBQ and sides. The service was fast and friendly. The cheese biscuits and slaw were the perfect accompaniment tony BBQ plate. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"BBQ purists know that chains are to be avoided, but for BBQ chains, Jim 'n Nicks does a pretty good job with tender and moist meat, good choices for proteins and really good sides.  I chose the pulled pork, with mac & cheese and potato salad. The pork was nice and moist, but I did pour on some of their habanero table sauce and it had a good kick to it. The sides were excellent. I do love the bread rolls.  Service was meh. Perhaps because we were sitting in the corner and it was tough to catch her eye.  Still, it's all about the food and the food was good. Yep, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Pretty darned good! For a \"chain\" BBQ place, Jim 'N Nicks still has a lot of the taste of a hole-in-the-wall. If you're looking for casual dining ala Friday's/Tuesday's/Applebee's, but with BBQ and a full bar, this is the right place!  My sliced brisket plate had a great tangy/smoky flavor and the meat was perfectly tender. No knife needed here. The 'tater salad was crisp and cold, well mixed up with a few pieces of potato in there. The baked beans are clearly not straight from the can. They have a BBQ zing to them as well as pieces of meat and onion - yummy.  The sweet tea needed nothing, though the staff kept refilling my glass and pouring in more and more crushed ice.  Would I come back? You betcha!"}
{"text":"I love this southern chain. Excellent meal and service at this establishment and for a he record it was Coca Cola 600 race week and this place sits right near the raceway yet the service was superb (this is a big deal because any town but especially Charlotte/Concord is consumed this week with the 600 following the All Star Race so service staff could be quite testy and dismissive but not the day I visited) and the food tasty."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ chain in a shopping center close to my house. The ribs are usually good, although they have been dry once. Pulled pork is pretty good as well, and when I'm on the healthy bandwagon I order it over salad."}
{"text":"I went here on a work lunch and thought the interior was adorable with its old fashioned nik nacks. I can only bas my food experience off of the PIG IN THE GARDEN salad which was topped high with pulled pork. Overall pretty yummy and it was a good size serving of food.  I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Really want to like this place but it always seems like something negative happens when we go here. Staff is really nice though. Food is just ok. Last time we went, my wife's BBQ Nachos were cold. It was like they pulled them out of a refrigerator and forgot to heat them up. Really odd."}
{"text":"We had a full lunch spread delivered to our office to feed a group today.  Pulled pork, Mac & Cheese, beans, slaw, muffins, the works.  DELISH!  Everything was great, and  the M&C was especially so.  Creamy, cheesy goodness. I've never been to the restaurant, but the catering was great so I imagine the dine in experience will be too.  I'll need to check that out soon."}
{"text":"Simple review.   Amazing service.  Delicious drinks.  Great flavor with everything (pulled pork, ribs, greens, Mac and cheese, ect.) Best biskets I've had.   Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Very good for a chain. Consistent good food- but the service is hit or miss. I've visited several times and I've never left disappointedin the food. However, the service leaves quite a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE place for Bar-B-Q!! Everything is delicious and so fresh. They make all choices from scratch every day. The cheese biscuits are worth the trip on their own. I always order the chicken, which is melt in your mouth good. They also offer fried green tomatoes. Their house salad is the best salad in Charlotte!  This is a place not to be missed. The servers and management are also very friendly.  PS-- Don't forget to order pie!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during a conference (sometimes you need a break from the crowd) and took the hotel shuttle driver's advice to give Jim 'n Nick's a go. I enjoyed a smoked pork Cuban sandwich with a side of uh-mazing collard greens. The restaurant is good for families and larger groups. The decor is amusing and perfect for the vibe. I thought the meal was tasty and a good value for what I paid. Our server was very attentive and helpful, which was appreciated as we navigated the menu. If I return to NC, odds are good I'll come back here, too!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We had a the riblets as an appetizer and those were very good. I ate the pig on a bun which is a pulled pork sandwich. I ate the whole thing and my mashed potatoes with gravy. I don't normally eat my whole meal. My husband ate the baby back ribs and they were really good also. Will come back the next time we visit the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  In Charlotte for vacation so trying different places to eat.   Got the deluxe combo with 3 meats to try most of the their BBQ meat and it did not disappoint. The slow-cooked collards and the baked beans that came with my combo were outstanding. Also had the fried green tomatoes and it was one of the best I've ever tried.  Our server, Tosha, was really friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back here when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I took 8 people to lunch and had another great BBQ experience. Killer food, everyone was impressed and the service was great. The group had the brisket platter, BBQ Chicken, salad with pulled pork, brisket sandwich and pulled pork sandwiches. All got a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break. I went to the drive through and it did take about 15 minutes to get my food but it was worth the wait. I got the baked potato and it was hot and very filling. Wasnt too fond of the little biscuits that were included. They didnt taste fresh to me. But overall the food was good."}
{"text":"On one hand, we appreciate that they were open during the icy weather (In all honesty, the storm had passed the day before and the main roads were clear.  Some of the side roads were icy, but safe to drive slowly and carefully on).  On the other hand, we were really offended that they rushed us out of the restaurant, so they could close early at 8:30pm.  In fact, because of the weather, we'd called beforehand to ensure that they would be open and wouldn't mind seating us in the 10minutes it would take us to drive there.  Despite the assurances of the hostess, the manager posted a closed sign on the front door 5 minutes after we were seated and the staff proceeded to give us dirty looks while attempting to rush our meal.  If anyone had told us before being seated that they had planned to close so early, we would have gladly ordered our meal to go.  Instead, we were seated at 8:25 and rushed out of there at 8:45.  The food is mediocre at best and supposed to be Alabama style (Why?  We were in NC, which has amazing Bar-B-Q).  This is one of those chain Bar-B-Q joints that cooks all of their food early in the morning and just reheats it when the customers order their food (our food was barely room temperature).  The meats were dry and required tons of the sauce for flavor, but too much of the sauce covered up any of the smoky flavor that was supposed to be in the meal.  On a positive note, the ribs had a great pink smoke ring on the outside of the pork.  Also, we ordered their \"Smoked\" Buffalo Wings.  They may have been smoked at one point, but ours were fried.  Note to restaurants: Don't advertise something on your menu and serve something else; it is very rude.  The sides were sad.  We didn't enjoy the coleslaw or mac'cheese because they were under-seasoned.  We didn't eat more than half our fries due to being over cooked.  The Collard Greens were decent, not too greasy and had a hint of the pork flavoring.  Finally, the biscuits would be good if served warm.  They are a little odd though, I'm used to corn bread biscuits being either cheesy (savory with salt too) or sweet; not both.  Overall, the food deserves 2.5 to 3 stars for taste alone.  However, the food is over-priced and our dining experience wasn't enjoyable.  Our main waitress served our table, but she didn't really wait on us.  She'd run by, drop off a new drink (instead of refilling it) or something we didn't order/need, and then run off to finish closing her stations for the night.  The waitress-in-training was never seen again after taking our orders.  The manager even ran by in an attempt to snatch up our squirt-bottles of sauces, before realizing his error and taking off.  We've had a lot better and would try a different place for Bar-B-Q if we are ever back in the area."}
{"text":"Gross!!! First time we went we tried the drive threw and wound up just driving off. Figured they were new and need to give them another shot. Went inside to eat the second time and we sent the ribs back they were all dried out. I got the chicken and it was cold and fatty. The biscuits that everyone raves over funny tasting with a sweetness to them They comped our whole bill and said we were the 3rd people that complained about the ribs that day. We just now ordered at the drive threw again trying to give it another chance. The speaker was broke it took forever!! The mac and cheese was a big gloppy ball of grease! My brisket sandwich was ice cold and nothing but fat! My husband got the open faced roast beef It was again ice cold and on a piece of greasy Texas toast with a little bit of chopped pieces of fatty brisket thrown on top We threw it all in the garbage. The only good thing there is the chicken fingers!  1,2,3 strikes your out!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place ever got 4 stars. I have no clue why I returned a 2nd time. All the meat is chewy. There is absolutely no pride in this BBQ. This is also the 1st BBQ restaurant to have Less than 4 sauces. They have spicy and regular  (wich taste like ketchup). Sonny's has better BBQ than these fools and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good sweet tea! The cheese biscuits are amazing ! Great service ! We love this place !"}
{"text":"It is a great looking restaurant.  The location is nice  as well. I got the brisket and the portions were kind of small.  It is as if they cut some brisket off and took a bottle of barbecue sauce and poured it over the meat.  The sauce tasted too much like ketchup.  The collard greens could have been boiled down more.  This was my first time so perhaps some other items were better."}
{"text":"I never write food reviews but had to make an account to do this.  We ate there tonight and it was one of my worst experiences ever! The BarBQue pork had more fat than meat- it was awful! The onion rings are the frozen kind - not homemade.  The beef brisket was cold.  The sides were bland."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Hot wings, deviled eggs, bread, salads and on Sunday's, chicken fried chicken meal is good."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. A bit expensive, but everything is delicious!!! Mac & cheese is awesome, mashed potatoes and gravy, Awesome! I could go on and on. Haven't tried the brisket yet or chicken. But the pork is good and so is the sauce. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the server was honest about the food choices to the point where we only ordered what he recommended.  I appreciate the honesty but if you don't believe in your product 100%, then I can't give you 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is our favorite BBQ SPOT! The atmosphere is fantastic! The service is on point and the food is always delicious. Their baby back ribs are to die for. Today we sat at The bar waiting for our table and fell in love with our bartender Lindsay -she is amazing.  Next our manager Tim brought us the best baby back ribs this side of the Carolinas!  The baked beans are amazing. We love Jim & Nick's. Whenever you're in Charlotte or Concord raceway, be sure to drop in - they will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was at Jim N Nicks for a work lunch and the server inadvertently spilled vinegar BBQ sauce down the back of my winter top coat. The server immediately alerted the manager who came out and immediately offered to pay for the dry cleaning. I sent him a receipt and he sent me a gift card very promptly. While I know this review isn't based on the overall food, it was good to see a business immediately right a potentially bad situation!  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had from this restaurant has been phenomenal but I think their biscuits have to be my favorite."}
{"text":"Great service and conversation by Derick. The food was once again incredible!!! The GM stopped by to say hello as well. We will be back, as this place is affordable, the taste is amazing and the staff makes you feel like you are at home. I don't think I've seen an employee yet that wasn't smiling."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get good southern food! Although the collards aren't the best I've had, the brisket surely makes up for it. The staff is friendly and helpful. I often get carry out and it's just as good as sitting down at a table. I highly recommend Jim and Nicks if you want that southern fare!"}
{"text":"Simple review: if you want BBQ in Concord, this is the place. Period. Even the sides (Mac and cheese, cole slaw, etc) are off the chain. Good beer and liquor selection."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It was my first time in the area, so I decided to try Jim 'N Nick's just by the reviews. The staff was friendly and professional, the location was located near I-85 and the food..... First off let me say, the Chili and the Cheese Biscuits are AWESOME! The menu had a variety of goods to choose from, so it was difficult to make a decision. I had to try a little of everything....collard greens, macaroni and cheese, wings. If I am ever in Concord again, Jim 'N Nick's will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"THIS establishment is AWESOME! The staff is friendly and very attentive. We had a poor experience at another location but this one has been phenomenal every time."}
{"text":"Very poor service. We were there around 4pm on a Thursday. Long wait to get bread. Bread came without butter. Bread cooled waiting for waitress to come back with butter. Food arrived and my entire plate was warm. The meat didn't have the Carolina sauce. Food cooled to a room temperature warm once the sauce came. Waitress never asked to refill our drinks. Manager greeted the table behind us who was sat after us but not us at all. Not even when we left and had to ask to get by him did he speak to us. He didn't say excuse me, have a good evening, NOTHING!"}
{"text":"When I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed a chimney with smoke coming out of it -- something you might expect to see in Lexington, NC, but unfortunately a less common sight in the Charlotte area.  On the way out, I saw a drive-through and an honest-to-goodness woodpile.  I've only been there once, and I'm wavering between a 4 and a 3.  It is a chain, but  the menu notes that they support local farms and the Southern Foodways Alliance.  I think it's really more of a 3, but among chains, I'll call it a 4.  Complimentary cheese biscuits arrived shortly after I was seated, and they were good.  There's the same menu for both lunch and dinner.  I didn't see any smaller servings, but my waiter (Lori) suggested I get the pulled pork sandwich without the bun.  The meat came with sauce already on it, starting sweet and finishing peppery.  The pork was flavorful; interesting, as opposed to bland.  Lori had also suggested the mac and cheese as the side (the sandwiches come with one side, the plates with two), and that was also delicious (and filling).  I didn't really have room enough for more than a bite of dessert (banana pudding, coconut pie, etc), but I got a slice of \"lemon icebox pie\" to go: the lemon filling was richer than lemon meringue pie, and the crumbly crust had a pleasantly contrasting salty tinge (when a waiter had brought it out on a plate, the fork was chilled ... a nice touch)."}
{"text":"I called in two orders for take out while at work. Kind of awkward just being sent over to the empty bar to get my food but alright. Everything was packaged nicely and ready when I arrived 30 minutes after my call. I did have to mention I also ordered drinks but the person working the bar was very nice and quick once she came up. I had a pulled pork sandwich with fries, onion rings and a lemonade. Last minute, I added a lemon chiffon pie to my order. $24 w/ tip. The sandwich was delicious, next time I'll skip the fries and just order the onion rings. The onion rings were perfect even cold! The right amount of onion to breading ratio. If you take away anything from my review - get the pie!! I am a jerk about fake whipped cream and pancake syrup instead of the real deal. This lemon curd was so good you could taste the lemon and egg yolks and the whipped cream on top was fresh. I would go through the drive thru at Jim N Nicks just for this pie."}
{"text":"Scr*wed up our to-go order beyond belief, even when I repeated myself twice over the phone.  Out of four sides, three were completely wrong.  I called to complain, and they said I could either pick up the correct sides or they could send me a gift certificate (no mention of value of said certificate, we'll see).  Personally, I think that when you spend over $30.00 for takeout for two people and it's completely bungled by whoever threw this together, they should grab one of those workers who scr*wed it up and have them drive the correct food over.  It's simple logic in my opinion.    The food was the usual mediocre chain restaurant product.  In a nutshell: totally not worth it."}
{"text":"This was a great place for us to go on our business trip to Charlotte. My colleague had the burger, which was really good and I had the Carolina style pork which was great. The biscuits that they give you our miniature and have a ton of butter and a little bit of cheese, which makes them unbelievable.  I saw some complaints about rude staff, but we did not receive any problems from ours."}
{"text":"I catered with Jim 'N Nick's for my daughter's shower. I initially chose them because I knew the BBQ was good AND they sell in bulk.  While those things are true I can now add that the service is incredible! When we picked up the BBQ the racks/sterno was left out. They drove them to us 30 minutes away AND with a great attitude!!! All around great experience."}
{"text":"Not too many are aware of the drive thru take-out window. So I was lucky enough to get there and not have to wait in line to order my lunch. It was around 11:40ish when I arrived so my stomach was overly excited.  You can grab a small plate or a combo for less than $10. If you have lunch buddy then you can place two separate orders in their drive-thru. If you have time to eat inside then you will have more options... in which I would suggest a turkey sandwich. Sounds simple but I promise you will be full after devouring your meal (because I know I did).   The servers are always pleasant, so I would highly recommend this place for a quick BBQ fix!"}
{"text":"BBQ.. finally found a BBQ spot that beats my other BBQ place and its even closer to my house! My honey and I stopped in here last night had a taste for some ribs! Mike who is the manager here was more than helpful he actually took the time out and ran down the menu with us. We ordered the spare ribs and sides to go, fries,and baked beans. While sitting next to us was a guy that appeared to be having the time of his life by his self at the bar lol, he told the bartender hey get these two young people whatever they want and put it on my tab well i ordered a margarita, told him thanks he said life is good i said yup amen cheers to that, sipped down my little margarita we told him thanks grabbed our food came home and smashed everything.We will be back! Thanks Mike again for all the help. Oh yeah i totally forgot to mention those cheddar biscuits um,um good! Those biscuits should be a sin they are so darn good."}
