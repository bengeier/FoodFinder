{"text":"I liked the cabo cobb salad with chicken althou my avocado wasnt the freshest it was tasty overall, not a large portion thou and found it to be on pricey side at $12. The cold pressed juices were also good but found them a bit too sweet and a bit too sour for my likings. (Im a bit of a juice snob thou and would prefer freshly made instead of pre-made as I feel some of the nutrients get lost). edit: came back today to get a breakfast bowl and the girl who made it was wearing NO GLOVES (cutting up my bananas etc) . I mentioned it but they didnt seem to care. This completely grossed me out and I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Great food, a little small on the inside, great for take out. Right beside the St. Lawrence Market. One thing I wish us that the portions were a little bigger for $12 without a drink."}
{"text":"Meh you sucky.   If you want tiny portions that will make you feel that 'thats it?!' feeling then this is your jam. I trust you are not, however, into that.   I got a breakfast bowl and a smoothie. Way overpriced and its something you can make with a small haul at the grocery store.   A waste of $16."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a healthy take-out option in the neighborhood for breakfast and lunch.  All of their items are really tasty, although portions could be a little bigger for the breakfast and lunch boxes. I'm happy that the breakfast items are now available all day."}
{"text":"This place is gross. I don't know what was wrong with my salad but the kale and toppings were all warm. Who wants a warm salad. Also small portions for what you are paying for when you can get a way better salad up the street. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The only reason I consume their food is because we order this at work.   My order is almost always wrong, or missing. It's incredibly overpriced for what it is. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went in and purchased lunch with my own cash - order was still wrong, staff was rude. I will never actually spend any of my own money on this place and I don't recommend them. I likely will not be ordering from them through work again, either."}
{"text":"For a healthy tasty meal it doesn't get better. Evolution does one thing and they do it very well."}
{"text":"Lovely new spot! Always on the hunt for healthy places and I'm so glad I found this on Yelp. I went with a friend during lunch rush, and while the place was busy, I was very happy that it did not reveal the impatient side of me. The staff was very friendly and professional. I ordered a lunch bowl with juice combo. Food was fresh and surprisingly filling, while the juice was nothing too spectacular (perhaps Greenhouse Juice Co. spoiled my taste buds?) but still quite decent.  In addition to the hanging plants, the bright yellow stools and rustic decor put me in a very positive mood. Overall, would recommend this new place to any health nut working in the Design/Financial District! Would definitely return to try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"I wish I could write about the quality of the food. Unfortunately, EFC is inaccessible to many people. \"Evolution\" is a misnomer. An evolutionary eatery would encourage everyone to try its l food and make it from unsprayed, organic, and hormone-free ingredients. Healthful? Not so much. Trendy? Maybe. Comfortable? No! Every table and chair is high and made of industrial metal. I use crutches and can't sit there at all. But it's not just people with disabilities who feel unwelcome. I live nearby and almost never see anyone sitting there, while nearby eateries are mobbed. Getting fresh-made meals and juices requires standing and waiting, so I only sampled two pre-made juices from the fridge: Pure Gold (carrot, orange, apple, pineapple, lemon) and Watermelon Wonder (watermelon, lime) juice (pleasant, but surely no wonder). Toronto has countless cold-pressed juice/fresh food stands and sit-down eateries. I can get very nice juices across the street at St. Lawrence Market and enjoy them at one of many accessible tables. EFC will eventually have to comply with the Accessibility for Ontarians Disability Act, so why not be accessible from the start? AODA is already in place. The owner is either waiting for deadline or doesn't expect his business to last that long."}
{"text":"Got the Harvest signature with brown rice and for $14 got less than a cat eats.   Rice was completely unseasoned and bland.  Beats were hard and undercooked. Tofu was hard and had no flavour.  Only the squash was the edible part.  Never bothering with this place again."}
{"text":"Ingredients seemed to be good quality, but the value for money was way off. $14.69 for lunch box got me a fairly measly portion that tasted pretty bland (harvest box). The menu was also misleading as to whether one or two greens/grains were included (asking the cashier was not helpful and I ended up being charged $1.00 extra for quinoa)  There are so many options for better value food in the area that are less pretentious and overpriced than this place. Unless you have more money than sense, forget about Evolution Food Co."}
{"text":"OMG amazing place with healthy delicious  food. So happy it's just 2 min walk from home."}
{"text":"I ordered a Moroc bowl through ubereats and overall was pretty disappointed.  I found the whole thing pretty bland as the chicken was dry, there was just a little bit of feta and there wasnt enough of a punch in the dressing to make the whole thing come alive.  I cant comment on the restaurant or service since I got handed the thing out of a car window (still getting used to that) and maybe the quality suffered a little bit due to how I got it so I will make an effort to visit the store one day and post an update."}
{"text":"Live in the neighbourhood - so glad to have something like this around. Have had their cabo Cobb salad twice now and love it. They are still in opening mode, sometimes a bit slow but I'm guessing this will improve once they get in their grove. Much needed healthy addition to the st lawerence food scene."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cabo Cobb salad with chicken, brown rice, and spinach through UberEats and when it arrived, the food was still nice and warm. The portion was a good size, a lot of chicken, spinach and rice. However, the salad was overly dry... The dressing is so-so and the chicken was almost too tasteless to eat. It had a very strong bad \"chicken\" smell and it was beyond dry. It was a $14.99 salad after all, so I managed to finish the salad and did not touch the chicken. I definitely would not recommend it and wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"Small salads, overpriced for how much protein you're getting, chicken is extremely bland, do not pay attention to food allergies, if you're ordering online, they  are always late and get your order wrong."}
{"text":"Great concept. We need more healthy + flavourful options downtown. The Cabo Cobb and Morroc are both great options. My problem with this place are the price points. I don't believe the ingredients are organic so why am I paying $14 for a \"bowl\". Sometimes the avocado portions can be pretty skimpy too. If you aren't concerned about prices then you'll be happy here."}
{"text":"The juice here is great and the staff are always super friendly and pleasant. I recently tried one of their signature lunch boxes, the Cabo Cobb, a combination of chicken, quinoa, mixed greens, spiced beans, corn, cheese, pico and avocado. All in all it was very fresh, clean and tasty! Only let down was the use of canned corn niblets... Come on guys, It's summer time, fresh corn is pretty easy to source."}
{"text":"I've been in twice, the first time I was a bit \"whelmed\" on a Saturday morning. The cashier was standoffish and but the smoothie (anti-oxidant berry?) was pretty good.  The second time was great! It was a weekday late lunch-time snack, and I got the Cookies and Cream smoothie. Much friendlier service - she actually gave me their stamp card, and I like this smoothie better!  I've seen a lot of comparisons to IQ, and I must say I find the staff at Evolution much friendlier!"}
{"text":"The food was expensive for very low quality ingredients. I bought the Mexican style salad with salmon. The coriander dressing is yogurt based with text mex type powdered spice seasoning. It sounded nice but had little taste, and there are was no salsa or hot sauce to add to the salad.  You can not substitute salad ingredients.  My bill was over $16 but there wasn't a lot of food. Both me and a friend who ordered a different salad found it greasy, lacked flavour and pricey."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place!! It's in my neck of the woods, and I recently started to love green juices.   I had the harvest box... Very boring!!! The only sauce they put on it is a balsamic reduction....   The rice is dry and unseasoned  Spinach dry...  Sweet potatoes and beets under cooked.  I also had the \"tropikale\" juice. Don't try it unless you like the taste of cucumbers and onions... They don't list onions on the ingredients, but that's all I could taste. Maybe the cut the pineapple on a board that was recently used for onions.   Thankfully the customer service is nice. Server let me trade my green juice in for one that look and tasted a lot fresher!   In conclusion... Not worth $22.32!!   Their saving grace might be the baked goods!!! Smelled delicious! Or a different box! Good luck!!"}
{"text":"I considered buying this for dinner earlier this week after a day of fasting and it was probably best that I opted against doing so in the end. The 3-star average rating for this place (at the time of my writing) seems fair to me. Evolution is almost like a less expensive spin-off of iQ (Bay & Wellington) but the flavours are not too memorable and, most noticeably, the boxes are not very full. I ordered the Ranchero, which is essentially a Mexican-inspired box that contains, among other ingredients, quinoa (I believe I picked that base, there must have been a few other options to the tune of brown rice, etc. if memory serves), pico de gallo (like a little salsa - nice and fresh!), shredded monterey jack cheese, beans, an egg, and avocado, all drenched in a sauce. I can't say the sauce really tickled my fancy (it tasted chipotle-esque, which I generally adore but not as much in this case) but the box was otherwise pretty tasty! I definitely felt hungry afterwards though so I would recommend buying something to go alongside your meal as a box alone is not plentiful in my humble opinion (and I consider myself to not be too much of a heavy-eater). Overall, not bad :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of quinoa and veggie based bowls.  They also have meat.  Their salmon dishes are good.    Love their breakfasts and shakes."}
{"text":"Big portions of healthy food for a fair price. Located in a busy hub and easy to miss but my breakfast staples are all here! Love"}
{"text":"Working in the neighborhood, it's become a great spot for a healthy, delicious, and fast lunch.   The ingredients are always fresh and delicious (my fave is the Maroc salad with spiced chickpeas, cucumber, feta, tomato, parsley, and hummus) but I have to admit it's pricey (about $24 for salad and juice) but in line with prices in the touristy area of St. Lawrence Market spots.   The food is comparable to the nearby  (and cheaper) iQ, but Evolution has the advantage of much shorter lines (perhaps until the word gets out) and  has much friendlier service."}
{"text":"First things first - extremely overpriced. You can make everything you see here at home, for way less. Why am I paying 9 dollars+ for a 16 ounce smoothie? In regards to the grain bowls, I never felt like I was getting enough. This food is supposed to \"satisfy and energize\" you but I'm left feeling hungry and disappointed. Another aspect, health and safety. I am perplexed at how employees can prepare food either without wearing gloves or not properly washing their hands. If you're allergic to anything on the menu, don't even bother coming here because everything is probably cross contaminated. Lastly, customer service is horrible. Rude employees that don't seem to care. If I'm asking questions about YOUR ridiculously expensive food, you better be knowledgeable about it. Skip this place, save your money."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and stumbled upon this place in search of a healthy breakfast, and it fit the bill perfectly. Not sure about the other reviews' experiences as mine was fantastic. I have actually come here two mornings in a row, I enjoyed it so much!  The breakfast was very healthy, fresh, quick and tasty. The staff were all as friendly and helpful as they could be, even assisting in my sight seeing planning of the city!    I highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Great place close to St. Lawrence Market with a nice selection of healthy food options such as salads, smoothies, healthy bowls... Everything was fresh, but the portions were a bit small and prices are high."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekday lunch after my coworker always raving about the place (so he probably hyped it up for me a lot) Got there around 1.30pm, there was no line up and they had a lovely patio outside.   Got the Market St. salad (apples, cranberries, goat cheese with mixed greens and honey dijon baslmic) to go with chicken and quinoa. It was quick, only had to wait about 5 minutes, but everything was pre-made and they just had to put it in the cardboard container. The salad itself was good but it came out to be $14 - I was full after but it could have been a bigger serving, and felt like something I could easily make at home. Will definitely give their juice a try next time though but they are on the expensive side...."}
{"text":"Came by here for their grand opening and was very impressed with the quality and flavour of the food.  They focus on healthy eating so there's no way you will find burgers, fries, etc.  Instead you will find salads, grain bowls, cold pressed juices, smoothies, etc."}
{"text":"I'm concerned that staff aren't properly trained or supervised in handling food. The cashier wore plastic gloves while handling money at the cash register, then went to the salad bar and scooped her hands in the produce with that very same glove. I confronted her and she made another salad, but didn't acknowledge that there was anything wrong with what she had done.  Shortly after, a guy emerged from the bathroom and started handling produce (celery, I believe) with his bare hands. There was a hand washing station right next to him, which he didn't bother to use. Perhaps he washed his hands in the bathroom, but he would have been touching the door on his way out.   The salads are nice, albeit overpriced. But I've lost my appetite due to their carelessness with safe food handling procedures.  IQ on Wellington Street has people stationed on the salad bars with gloves, so I'll opt to go there from now on."}
{"text":"Love the Vegan options!  Yay!  I ordered the oatmeal bowl, which I will admit I wasn't in love with.  But the almond butter shake was tremendously delish.  I agree with previous reviewers, the price is a bit high for what you get.  But I absolutely love all the vegan options.  It's nice to know there is a place to eat for us too."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little spot this is.  Finally had a chance to walk down Market Street and was surprised to find all these great food options condensed in St. Lawrence. I gravitated towards Evolution because I'm always looking to eat healthy, and I'm mental for smoothies.  I had been a few times and just grabbed beverages -- including an insanely good peanut butter blend, as well as the flavourful Antioxidant Blast (black, blue, rasp, and straw-berries). It wasn't until recently I tried the Cabo Cobb and now I'm totally hooked. I enjoyed it very much, and the added chicken was so fresh it melted in my mouth. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes and combinations.  Market Street is a great atmosphere for their patio. It's a relatively quiet street sparse of traffic, so I imagine sitting out there on a sunny day would be fantastic. I find the staff friendly and efficient, and the restaurant itself looks great. Good menu design as well.  Another awesome (healthy) food option in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"No flavour. Not worth the price.   My office just ordered lunch from here through Foodora delivery service. Some of the salads were great (The Market Salad and the St. Lawrence had good reviews), but I ordered the Khoasan with tofu, spinach, and rice, and it was incredibly bland. There wasn't enough dressing, or of the actual salad I wanted, with red peppers, mangos, cucumbers, peanuts. etc; it was mostly unseasoned rice, plain tofu, and dry spinach.   Definitely not worth the $17 (!!!!) I paid for it."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Beautiful location on Market Street, not too busy and was easily able to score an outside table to enjoy my lunch.   I'm a big fan of the food at IQ, but I'm not a huge fan of the massive queue of yuppies that occurs everyday at lunch time there. I discovered this place today and think it will be my IQ replacement until the yuppies discover it's existence. No line up at all and had my lunch in hand within 5 minutes of walking in.   Fresh ingredients, not a huge menu but if you're interested by salads and grain bowls, you'll probably find something you'll like.   A bit pricey, 12$ for a salad with chicken, but it was very tasty and exactly what I wanted to eat for lunch. The bottled water is a bit pretentious, so next time I will bring my own tap water from the office.   Overall a good place for lunch in a great location."}
{"text":"I had the Heart Beet with Whey Power. It was awesome.  We also tried the Chocolate Dream--also excellent.  The ingredients are seasonally fresh and the staff were friendly.  This is not your shopping mall sugar water schlock.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oy. Where do I start? I generally don't like writing 1 star reviews for places, but this one really deserves special treatment.   Extremely small portions, high prices, a dubious commitment to basic food safety... really as bad as it gets. Oh yeah, customer service non existent.   With all the good options around you really wonder how such a place can stay in business in this day and age."}
{"text":"Definitely should have listened to the other reviewers before coming here. I went in on a Sunday morning and ordered the Sunrise Harvest breakfast bowl which tasted pretty good, but be warned it comes in a small box with an even smaller portion. The wait time was also way longer than it should have been. The staff were all lovely and pretty knowledgable about the menu, but I was disappointed to see that they have egg in everything on the breakfast menu so to make it vegan, they just take out ingredients instead of replacing them. Even though they had an alright variety of options, this place probably isn't worth the money. Will most likely not be spending almost $10 on a sampler sized breakfast here ever again."}
{"text":"I ordered Lawrence salad for lunch and paid $1.49 extra to substitute avocado with cheese. However when I got the food (delivered to me via uber eats), to my greatest disappointment, there was no cheese to be found. I mean the food was all right and it wasn't particularly mind blowing, I just wish they could be more careful when prepping the food, especially I paid extra for cheese. Will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"I read about this place online and finally got to try it over the weekend. I am a huge fan! The food here is delicious and the juices are refreshing.   I went here on Saturday for lunch and it wasn't busy at all (quite empty). That had me worried but I was relieved when I took a bite of my food. I got the Cabo Cobb bowl with brown rice, mixed greens, and chicken. All the ingredients worked well together and everything tasted fresh. I also got a 'Energize Me' juice to go along with the salad. I don't think the juice was anything special (I've been to other pressed juices around the city so perhaps Im a little picky). Other than that I would return to here to get some delicious healthy food!"}
