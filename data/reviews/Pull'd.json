{"text":"Tried the Red Velvet Pancake Pulled pork sandwich place right by the now closed Epic Burger stand.  The sandwich is basically 3 small pancakes with pulled pork stuffed in between the cakes.  Because the sandwich is so floppy, it can't be picked up to eat, which is a good thing because it would get messy with all the sauce on the pork.  The pork itself tastes all right, the beef is tasty and has good texture.  But the combination of this unique creation does not work together.  The sandwich I got also didn't look like the advertised picture for the Jack'd.  I didn't get a double layered of pancake for each section like their picture suggested.  Food experiment fail."}
{"text":"Over rated.  I had the stacked and it was a over priced heap of a mess.  The bun was soaked with the sauce and oil. You're not going to pick it up.  The peroges that they put in between the buns tasted okay. The coleslaw and beans tasted like store bought. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"really great quality for the price that was paid...great portion and really good flavor...only complaint was not \"saucy\" enough
Fantastic meal"}
