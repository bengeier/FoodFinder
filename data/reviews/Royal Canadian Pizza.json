{"text":"One of the best cheese and viggie pizzas in Calgary! Its true the place is old and they dont have a bathroom...but their pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered this place for a work lunch. They took over an hour to get our pizza here and it was cold. never again. The driver also couldnt find our building which has a HUGE sign on a major street. Again, stick with the brand name pizza places, you get better deals anywhere else and not have to wait an hour for pizza."}
{"text":"We have been to this location before and usually it is ok. However today the pizza was not good at all. When we started  eating the pizza it was bland and had little to none toppings. I don't like their service nor their pizza. Never eating there ever again."}
