{"text":"We went for brunch in the morning .. Quite a find  .. and delicious coffee .. great brunch food.. had amazing challah French toast"}
{"text":"Warm inviting atmosphere paired with a menu that is far from off the wall...but interesting and well-done (except for the raw selections of course!)"}
{"text":"I originally wrote 'stumbled' and realized everyone else used the word. It's because it's in an alley and is very small. However, I did stumble upon this find while my travelmates were shopping nearby. Place is small and a good woodsy decor keeping you guessing if it's  been open a year or 10. Blonde, Amber and house red or white on tap and well drinks on happy hour. Also, had a sign oysters happy hour at 5pm. Bartender had a kick ass shirt referencing the Karate Kid bad boys of the Cobra Kai Dojo, unfortunately not available for sale. She later revealed she was the owner, which was awesome since she was never too busy to chit chat with us.  If  I was from here I would definitely frequent this place often. Until next time Montreal!"}
{"text":"Very good deal in Old Montreal, very tourist traps abound. Super fresh salad and delicious pad Thai. Was packed at 2 pm on a nice Friday afternoon. Very good service and great classic rock, not too loud. Very interesting menu. Cool place!"}
{"text":"dinner recently, cute small place, long bar with uncomfortable stools (too close to the bar) and a pretty good business, servers were pleasant but perhaps a little too busy and service could get slow....for was a hit and a miss, wife had the lamb spinach wellington with came with a honeydew melon based side and it was wonderful, i had the burger which was awful, ordered rare and it was at least medium well and the meat was too compressed....i would have sent it back but wife's meal took a while to prepare (they told us this) and i didn't want to be too much out of sync...so i ate half, interesting busy place and also a noisy place"}
{"text":"Stumbled up on it just to have a beer and ended up ordering one of the best burgers i've ever had. I bet the drinks are excellent as well because I saw the bartender prepping for the night, she was squeezing fresh limes and lemons, as a bartender in the past, that is a sign of quality."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great service!  Order the dragon wings and you will thank me for it."}
{"text":"Loved this cute little pub! I was in Montreal for my sisters bachelorette weekend. We had just visited the Notre-Dame Basilica and were hungry for a quick bite to eat and just decided to stop in somewhere near by. We did not make a reservation because it was a last minute decision. Even though we showed up with 15 girls, the woman who worked there was still so welcoming and pushed some tables together for us to make sure we could all be together. This was very much appreciated as most people here in Boston would have turned us away!   The drinks were great and the bartender made them very quickly! The food was ordered and served to us in a timely manner and all at the same time. I was very impressed because 15 meals is a lot! It was also delicious. We were al very grateful!"}
{"text":"We stumbled into this gem during our first visit to Montreal and everything about it was exceptional! Service was fantastic and the food was high quality and delicious. Pub Saint-Pierre has a unique and creative menu, so anything you choose will not disappoint. We especially recommend the challah French toast grilled cheese - make sure you use the side of maple syrup! Other highlights include the grilled portobello and goat cheese sandwich and the cauliflower Mac and cheese salad."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this adorable pub while looking for a place to brunch. Brunch was SO good, we came back for dinner which was equally as delicious! Highly recommend the caramelized apple ricotta toast, steak and cheese meat pie, Bruiser burger and Tuscan salmon.  So everything we ordered - we loved!Wait staff were attentive and nice to us and our 2 year old. I even loved the bathroom soap! Funny to mention in a restaurant review but it's true that I googled how to get my hands on the same soap! If we didn't find this place on our last day in Montreal, we might have frequented for every meal during our stay! Thank you for being the restaurant highlight of our trip!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Montreal for one night and were starving when we arrived around lunch time. We walked in circles trying to find a casual spot to sit and have some drinks along with some tasty bites after a long ride. This place nailed it! The drinks (in particular the wines) were fantastic and well priced. And the food was some of the tastiest we have ever had. I had a BLT with the most insane bacon I've ever had. My wife had the poke salad and was blown away as well! We are so thrilled to have stumbled upon this place. And added bonus, great atmosphere and decor and even nicer staff working there. A++"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Was empty so we were worried but it was super fresh and delicious!!!! Highly Recommend !!!!"}
{"text":"Nice bar that serves brunch.  Excellent omelets, soup and salads, all washed down with a bloody caesar.  A lot of the restaurants stop serving at around 2pm to prepare for dinner.  Not this place, making it an ideal spot for a late brunch."}
{"text":"This is a great little pub. Nice drink menu, creative bar food, and a hearty dinner menu. The atmosphere is relaxed and cozy. Had some appetizers and drinks here on a whim and found it inviting and tasty!"}
{"text":"I stumbled in here after google maps had me going in circles in Vieux-Montreal looking for a place that had gluten free sandwiches etc.  I was hungry, cold, and tired when I was lucky enough to walk by this place, scan the menu, and see they had brunch with gluten free pancakes.   Came in, sat down, and a few minutes later, I had some coffee, gf pancakes with fresh fruit, and a reprieve from wandering around hungry and cold.  Not sure why it says it's closed on Sundays, but it's definitely open for brunch starting at 10am on weekends."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and once for dinner. I normally come with a friend who really loves the burger and gets it every time with bacon. It's a pretty good burger, but I actually prefer the turkey burger which comes with guacamole and a spicy mayo (I also add bacon, would definitely recommend .) Just for reference, I normally strongly prefer beef to turkey, but I think the turkey one is more interesting flavor-wise. The only downside to both is that they don't come with fries (the restaurant doesn't make fries I think? ) But the side salad that they come with is pretty solid.   When I came for dinner I had a salmon poke bowl which was also really good. Drinks are regularly priced and the waitress we always seem to have (for lunch ) is super nice. Service can be pretty slow though and it's normally kind of tight when we come here for our lunch hour."}
{"text":"A really nice place to enjoy a local brew! We stopped in on our vacation and thoroughly enjoyed the beer list, especially all of the local offerings. It was also happy hour so they had drink specials (oysters also on sale).   Unfortunately a number of places we stopped in Montreal were slightly pretentious and the employees were not always too friendly. That was not the case here. They employees were personable and friendly and made us feel very comfortable."}
{"text":"Peut-être est-ce parce que l'amour rend tout beau mais qu'à cela ne tienne! Ce petit pub niché discrètement sur la rue St-Pierre, dans le Vieux Montréal, offre d'excellents cocktails, en plus d'un vaste choix de bières typiquement irlandaises. Côté bouffe, il n'est pas en reste. Les gyozas aux légumes sont déments et la salade de tartare de saumon m'a presque convertie au poisson cru. C'est en fait une poke bowl \" de luxe \". Vinaigrette au sésame et fines tranches d'algues nori. Magnifique. Le service est avenant et aimable. L'atmosphère est détendue, la clientèle d'après -boulot est là pour relaxer. Les touristes viennent y faire une pause. On y trouve son compte, quoi!"}
{"text":"I won't say I \"stumbled\" into this place as others have, but I certainly stumbled out of it. It's small and can be noisy, but the bartender knows how to take good care of a lost soul on a cold night. And, with pleasant surprise, I had one of the best burgers of my life. However you may stumble upon this place... it's worth the trip."}
