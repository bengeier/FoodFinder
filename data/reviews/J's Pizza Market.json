{"text":"Pizza was okay,  I've had it cooked there, and I've taken it home to cook myself, I do appreciate the high quality ingredients.  However, the service is very slow, and the people who I've encountered working there are very young and unprofessional.  It's the little things like having very personal conversations within earshot of the customers, and wearing shorts so short you can see their bottoms hanging out, hair is not tied back, long fake nails...  Not really the people who I want to prepare my food.  I won't personally go back again, but I wouldn't stop a friend from trying it."}
{"text":"J's offers delicious crazy \"never thought I'd have THAT on a pizza\" dishes!  Sliced potatoes on a pizza... for not even being crazy about potatoes... yep that was good.  What shocked me was my tastebuds' response to apples on a pizza.  Yes apples.  The apple bacon pizza was amazing and triggered some strange thing in my brain... I will get it whenever we go back.  Thanks to Groupon which offered some deals there, we have tried alot.  They are always fresh pizzas and tasty.... YUM!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this amazing spot. Highway had some major traffic. Needed gas and a restroom. Could not find a gas station and became frustrated until we came across the pizza place. Did not expect to have a positive experience but we did.

Atmosphere is laid back. The girl that helped us is very helpful, friendly and a hard worker. I did not get her name but she is knowledgeable about her pizzas and products. She even helped us with directions :) Anyways, I've worked in the service industries and it's nice to have an amazing experience like the kind we experienced today. We tried the Texas pizza with the pulled pork, bacon and pineapples. They even have old fashioned vanilla cremes which were awesome. This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"This chicken bacon ranch pizza is one of the best things to ever happen to me. The free slices are nice too, because then you can figure out what you want to buy NEXT time. :) I would have never known I would like the 4 cheese because it has blue cheese on it.. but it was so delicious and we can't wait to go back and get one of those. Pizza for grownups! Even my picky 10 year old loved it. He picked off the tomatoes/green onions (and promptly put it on my pizza) but raved about how good the chicken, bacon, sauce and dough were.  I wish I would have taken a picture, but we devoured it too fast!  Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my 11 year old for a quick, late lunch. We were treated so nicely by the staff! They game my son a sample of pesto sauce because he never had it before. He got the Pesto & pepperoni with spinach, and i got the King with spinach. Both were delicious! Definitely coming back. Soon!"}
{"text":"Lots of healthy options including whole grain and gluten free crusts.  Delicious combinations on their pizzas AND you choose to have them baked there or to take and bake at your place.  

I found them through a groupon and we have kept coming back. 

The potato pizza OR the spinach artichoke dip are favorites of mine, while my husband loves the Maui chicken pizza.  The salads are also fresh, tasty and crisp - for a light lunch or dinner the combo works well. 

If you go in and feel like you need more help deciding they do have free slices available of different type pizzas.  Try one!"}
{"text":"One of the few pizza places that i have been to that offers great tasting pizzas and salads, very interesting mix of healthy menu options and a good variety of vegetarian and vegan options, all with great service!  We opted for the wheat crust and ordered Little Italy and a mixed veggie pizza after getting a sampler there, which I think is a great idea! The pizzas are very flavorful and gourmet like. Little Italy with the pesto sauce hit the spot! The two ladies working there were very pleasant and attentive, a thumbs up for service!  We would certainly go there again the next time we are in the area"}
{"text":"Love, love, love J's Pizza Market. I crave their pizzas and I love to \"take & bake\". All the ingredients are so fresh and their specialty pizzas are unique and delicious. I have been a customer since they opened their doors and am looking forward to many, many more years of delicious food."}
{"text":"When trying a new pizza place I usually order the plain Neapolitan style as this is a good way to start a judge pizza. They have a wood fired oven, but in my opinion could make better use of it such as offering a true margarita type pizza. Anyway, what I tried very much average and I expected more. I may go back to try something else and the people there were friendly"}
{"text":"Once again I decided to stop in the pizza market for some pizzas to take home for dinner. The kids prefer pepperoni and cheese pretty unremarkable but my wife and I decided to get a BBQ chicken pizza onions on a wheat crust. I don't know what he does in those pizzas but they are 100 like Pringles chips. You just can't stop at one and subsequently we finish the entire pizza. J's pizza market is one of these places that I hope not too many more people discover it because I like that it's a small town owner atmosphere. However it wouldn't be a bad thing if there was one just a little bit closer to my house!"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 for great service and good pies.

Being on snack duty for a little league team means one thing: pizza! Everyone loves it AND you're not pumping everyone else's kids full of sugary treats at 9PM.

In a pinch tonight, we looked up pizza in Mentor on Yelp, found J's had good ratings and purchased a coupon. We preordered and didn't mention we had a coupon. Needless to say I wasn't expecting a super-smooth experience, since coupons always make things difficult. Boy was I surprised! 

Pizzas were ready for me and no grief with the coupon! Plus--the kids loved the pie. Great, quick and easy service. Maybe we'll stop back to try some of their crazy toppings. Plus you can go gluten free or wheat crust--plus by unbaked ones to cook at home."}
{"text":"Great selection of unique pizzas.  I was really impressed with the customer service here."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!  Everything we've had was delish.  We go at least once a month.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Very high quality pizza. I brought my family here for the first time because we bought a coupon online. We ate there and had them cook the pizza. I guess that you can also take home uncooked pizzas for your home oven. But we did not want to do that.

The pizza was very good!! They also had a lot of different options including gluten free and wheat crust. Give them a try. You won't be disappointed. 

They are a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"LOVE it...great that they will bake it for you,or you can take it home.Salads are also fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Best crust in the area. The wheat is amazing! The oven they use gives the pizza a different taste from other places. Always yummy.
 The salads are super fresh and come with delicious dressing. The staff and owner are incredibly nice. It's a great place to dine in or carry out. Reasonable prices for great quality food too. The place is always clean and tidy, with smily employees."}
{"text":"We're really glad this place is still in business!

My Parents and I came across this one time because of a Groupon that I had.  I've gotten my boyfriend hooked!

Sign up for their emails... you can get some great deals for great prices!  My Boyfriend always gets the Roni, and I always get the BBQ Pork Pizza (Yum!)

Yum! Yum! Yum!  If you haven't tried J's Pizza Market yet, you need to!  Best Pizza by far in Lake County! :)"}
{"text":"I am a pizza lover! This is my go to pizza place! I love the wheat crust and parmesan garlic sauce! Not many places ask if you want to take the pizza home and bake it yourself! Many options .Something for everyone.This is an excellent place for fast and friendly service!! They should open more locations!"}
