{"text":"Delicious coffee and croissants. Friendly staff. Great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly, service is quick, and the americanos are awesome. Also, amazing vibe."}
{"text":"Wonderful cafe! Their coffee is amazing (I've had a latte, cortado and an americano and each rank among the best I've had in this city), the space is really warm and inviting (lovely baristas, great art and the music is always on point) and it's super convenient, situated next to the Bathurst subway station. Definitely will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and great service. Can completely miss this place because of its location, but now I know its here it's my go to place for coffee. The prices are really reasonable too. 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Choice espresso coffee here folks!  Delicate crema, deep roasted and full bodied.  These guys have selected a delightful roast and are super particular about the freshness and feel of the brew.  Great atmosphere, friendly service, home made treats and all at very realistic prices.  Well worth the trip"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood coffee shop. All the staff are super friendly and their fresh muffins make my morning."}
{"text":"Great Coffee!!  Omar, the owner, is a veteran of several years as a barista at JetFuel, on Parliament St, and learned his trade well."}
{"text":"Small and cozy little cafe. Great service, along with some delicious little treats. Coffee is always perfect as well."}
{"text":"Small gem right by Bathurst station. The Barista was super friendly and was easy on us taking photos of our drinks. This place is mostly for takeout, and a small iced Mocha costs only $4. You can adjust your sweet level by adding sugar by yourself to the espresso cup before the barista makes the drink. I find this cool :)"}
{"text":"Ooohhh thank you! My americano was so smooth, perfect heat, perfect crema. More, please"}
{"text":"The quintessential local cafe that pulls a proper strong espresso shot. The rad barista/ co-owner Raif is a foam master and seems to know all the clientele's names and occupations. He says the pastries (croissants, tarts, danishes here today) are from Circles and Squares but they bake the muffins in-house. Today's was delish, despite being ultra refined white flour: blueberry strawberry banana. They don't take debit (yet, hopefully soon) and there's not a lot of space in here - just a  few barstools at a bench overlooking the transit traffic, the row of old brick three-story duplexes, and passersby like sleepy-eyed new moms pushing strollers and packs of private school kids wandering home with their ties askew."}
{"text":"Great spot!!! Had a cortado and a butter pecan tart.  Fresh deliciously balanced coffee and fresh tasty pastry.  No better way to start a day then with a coffee, a sweet treat and a smile."}
{"text":"Very nice owner!! Friendly and greet you with a warm smile!!  Espresso - 5/5 Americano - 5/5  There are approximately 5 seats in this small shop...   It is a very nice little cafe that I would go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"So great to find this gem a mere block from my old house in Toronto! Peerless espresso and fantastic baked goods. A true neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"This place is cute an a two minute walk from my place.  i like the fact that its affordable as in a won't have to pay an arm and a leg for a cup.  I got the mocha in a large and it was only 4 bucks. Like damn!  There a fair amount of place to move around and sit. For the most part, its a small little coffee shop. Their menu is on the wall and ask about their snacks.   Payment option is cash or credit so be prepared. I didn't know but my bank was near so not a bad thing. The employee is nice and the place is inviting so for sure a place i'd be visiting more often. I just love coffee."}
{"text":"I tried Volta Espresso this morning. I wanted to get out of the house and relax with a coffee before the busyness of the day. I always go to Starbucks but it finally occurred to me that I really should check out the indie coffee shops near me.   This cafe is really small and wonderful. The barista was such a nice guy and really kind to the customers. I enjoyed chatting with him. I bought a mocha and a muffin. When I order a mocha from the big chain coffee shops I always ask for \"half sweet\" so it isn't too sugary. I forgot to ask here and for the first time in my life a coffee shop made a mocha exactly to my taste! It wasn't too sweet at all, it was perfect (and I didn't need to add sugar.) It also looked gorgeous. I loved it. The muffin was delish and tasted really fresh to me. It must have been baked not too long before I came in. Prices are also really great.   The window is so nice and sunny and the music choice is perfect. There's also a little bench out front. It's actually so sunny that next time if I come on a sunny day I'll take my coffee to a park to enjoy it. Must be nice on a cold winter day though to go to Volta for some sunshine. I live so close, I'll definitely enjoy coming back often!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, muffins & service. The prices are reasonable as well. Very little seating (3 stools). Doesn't hurt that the owner is hot!"}
{"text":"Service: very friendly owner, prompt service.   Ambience: small shop but love the music. It will be a nice place to relax and re-energize yourself.   Food: coffee is very good. We had a cappuccino and Americano. The drinks get very nice crema. Espresso is strong since he served the drink with 10 grams for one shot vs 7 grams for normal Italian espresso. Love the drinks here.   Highly recommend this place if you are in the Mirvish Village neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Barely here for about two months, it's a good discovery! The coffee bean consists of a mixed blend. Miscela classica espresso blend would be a staple moving forward and I love how it has a slight bitter taste after.  The barista/ owner is a joy chat with besides making a good cuppa. New awesome coffee joint added to the hood that can't be missed."}
{"text":"Volta Espresso just opened up, and is a charming new cafe right on Bathurst Street, essentially across from the TTC station. Their drinks are affordable (starting at $3, and going up to $4), and delicious. The owners are genuinely engaged in their business and delighted to meet the customers and serve them their amazing creations. We tried a latte and americano on our first visit, and we're not disappointed!"}

{"text":"My favourite coffee place in Toronto and *exactly* what was needed at Bathurst and Bloor. Tasty coffee, awesome staff, a cool casual vibe, and homemade muffins (they switch it up every day -- my favourite is rhubarb/walnut). There are only a few seats, and a bench out front, but I usually grab my coffee on the go anyhow. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Right across the street from Bathurst Station, I stumbled into this cozy little cafe when it started to rain. Barista was very nice and The Strokes were playing. I ordered an iced Americano ($3), it was good, strong, but found some coffee ground remnants at the bottom (not a huge deal, just not ideal when drinking out of a straw). There is a big window and a few bar stools, nice for a little break. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area to try a latte."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The owner is incredibly fun to talk to and he always remembers my order. The design is cool and hip and the espresso is on point. I've tried various drinks here and they have all been wonderful. Couldn't ask for anything else! A true gem."}
{"text":"Great new spot in the neighborhood, right across from Bathurst Station. Friendly staff and very good espresso. Note that there are only a couple window seats - Volta is best suited for grabbing a coffee to go."}
{"text":"This place makes an amazing Americano.!The owners Omar and Raph are super welcoming and sincerely care about my business,which is more than I can say about surrounding coffee shops."}
{"text":"+ Great tasting and affordable coffee + The owners are very nice and the place attracts friendly customers + Small space with limited seating (maybe 4 seats).. This place is more of a grab and go kind of place  + Usually no long line ups"}
