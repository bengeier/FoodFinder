{"text":"Cute, local place. Food is nothing out of the ordinary, but sometimes that's just what you need. A no frills kind of place. The portions are just right for your stomach and your wallet."}
{"text":"Literally the best country breakfast for such a great price! The waitresses are the sweetest!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast with great service! Had the bacon/egg sandwich with hash browns and it was delicious! Our waitress was super friendly and made us feel at home.  Def worth a stop in for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"looks can be overlooked when you try there breakfast..food alway fresh and fast.The dining room was very clean..and try to get these prices in charlotte...home cooking must"}
{"text":"This was a perfect breakfast!!! They didn't miss a beat starting with the service - to the flavor of the coffee - to the breakfast itself!  Everything was wonderful - even their health grade - 99.5!!!    We both had eggs, livermush and hash browns. You won't find a better breakfast, excellent service, or deal!!!  I just wish they were open later for dinner!"}
{"text":"Little Country Kitchen lives up to its name. It reminded me of being in my mama's kitchen. The liver mush was perfection and grits well cooked, just add a little salt. The coffee kept coming and coming and coming, I was only below half a cup 1 time because she was cleaning the tables. I don't know how long this place has been here but I was born and raised in this area and this is my 1st Time here but certainly not my last.  The biscuit was huge and I'm sad that I could not finish it. It was little crunchy on the bottom (not burnt) but super soft and fluff on the inside.   Daily specials are posted on a chalk board in the back and along the glass case near the register.   I also noticed that as of November 2017 they have an 'A' rating with a 99."}
{"text":"I try to get breakfast from here everyday. Since my girlfriend passes it to go home from work. Great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Places like this are disappearing in our progress toward bigger and better.  Quality, personal service and just plain nice folks preparing simple and good food seem to be going away.  Outside of the Monroe airport and along Hwy 74 is this little local eatery along side the highway.  No big advertising or flash, it is noticeable by the number of cars parking around this building seemingly \"in the middle of nowhere.\"  Menu us breakfast and lunch all day, so long as it is between 4am and 3pm except for Saturdays when it closed at noon.  Sundays and Mondays it is closed.  Did I write 4am?  Yes I did.  A lot of the locals are farmers and run small businesses, so the Little Country Kitchen is one of the few places where you can get a sit-down meal in the wee hours of the morning.  Local color, if I may, is the normal, hard-working folks who live around here, interspersed with those few outsiders who stop in for a visit.  Simple layout which reminds me of a 1950s kitchen.  There are two rooms for dining, underlining how popular and good this place really is.    Menu has all the basics, and southern basics, like biscuits and country ham, not to be confused with the other hams smoked and cured outside of the old South.  Portions are good and substitutes are the norm.  Coffee and tea flow throughout your stay and your cup or glass never gets empty until it goes to the kitchen to be washed.  Nothing fancy, check the specials board and enjoy the old time simplicity and warmth of a local eatery."}
{"text":"I love this place, take my mother there for lunch and they make you feel as if they already know you. I love it the food is very good"}
{"text":"We were visiting family in Monroe and needed a place for breakfast.  The hotel recommended the Little Country Kitchen.  It's kind of a dive, but don't get me wrong, it is one of the top three breakfast places that we have ever tried!!!  We tried the eggs, omelets, grits, hash browns and the FABULOUS biscuits.  Did I say FABULOUS?????  They were even better than that.  Everyone was so sweet, and they all looked out for us and the other diners.  Superb service and even better food and so inexpensive.......can't wait to go back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Food is delicious and is prepared quickly. Great white pepper gravy!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a health food nut so I don't often eat a traditional American breakfast, but sometimes I just have to do it. One of my favorite breakfast splurges is biscuits and gravy and, believe it or not, it's not easy to find good B & G, but the biscuits and gravy here are excellent!! Fresh, homemade biscuits, lots of delicious sausage gravy... OMG, I'm salivating just thinking about it. Also my over easy eggs were cooked to perfection! The place is clean, everyone is super friendly, the service is fast even when they are really busy, and... I want more biscuits and gravy, please...!!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute, a great find for an old fashioned breakfast.  Western omelette was very good as well as fluffy biscuits and husbands French toast good as well.  Attentive and friendly service-prices were great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. You should too!  Good food, friendly staff, lots of regulars. Simple menu and the pricing is right. Clean."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Apparently frequented by the locals. We were pleased to find a simple country cooking spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice and love it! It reminds my wife of her childhood with homemade biscuits, yummy country ham,  eggs cooked to perfection. The service staff is friendly and attentive both time. Additionally, the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Chicken salad was delicious! I ordered the chicken salad with french fries and it came with my choice of coleslaw as my vegetable in addition to my fries. Chicken salad sandwich on white was a little skimpy but as usual my french fries were crisp like I had asked them to be and my coleslaw was delicious. Another quaint little place. Three stars for the cuteness and country feel. I hear the breakfast is delicious. Gonna hafta try that!"}
{"text":"This a great place to grab some home style cooking. Great service and food. I will definitely eat here again when traveling thru Monroe."}
{"text":"My coworkers favorite place to get lunch. I've had several dishes and have nothing but good things to say. Friendly service and great food."}
