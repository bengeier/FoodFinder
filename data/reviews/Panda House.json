{"text":"This was my first try at finding good Asian near me, unfortunately it was not a success.  The beef lo mein was incredibly slimy, maybe too much corn starch?  I also ordered beef pho but it was very bland."}
{"text":"Panda house is right in my backyard and my go to take out place. The staff is friendly everything on the menu is delicious and the place in general is beautiful."}
{"text":"Newly open restaurant. We have been pretty intrigued as we've driven passed the opening soon sign frequently. So we decided to give it a try tonight and ordered take out. We were presently surprised and will be back to try more items on the menu. 

This review is based solely on our take out experience. 

It was a very welcoming atmosphere. Can still smell the new paint as we sat at the bar waiting for our take out. There is lots of seating perfect for big or small groups. 

We were greeted instantly and given take out menus as per our request. Everyone seemed to be happy and friendly. However, when we asked for recommendations the person we spoke to was not too helpful. As a new restaurant, one would expect that servers have been trained to recommend certain dishes. I don't need you to tell me that I should get a rice dish. I want to know which one...that was a bit annoying. Regardless, we went through the menu and ordered a few dishes we would generally get at an Asian restaurant to get a comparison. Food did not take long at all. We waited about 15-20 minutes. 

We ordered the house special fried rice, sizzling beef striploin, salt and pepper calamari, General Tso's chicken and the Singapore rice noodle. Everything survived our drive home (we live in the neighbourhood). The food and flavours were on par to those of your average Asian restaurant like Congee Queen/Congee Star. We were surprised. Each dish we ordered ranged from about $10-$15, which is pretty average. 

Overall, we were pretty impressed. We will definitely be back to try a few more things on the menu and enjoy the sit down experience."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. The service is spectacular and the food is delicious. I love the Buddhist Delight, house fried rice, and the dry ribs appetizer! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Was my first time ordering from this place and it's really good! I got the veggie fried rice and the mango salad which is to die for! I'll definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Just had our first delivery from Panda House and it was great!  Everything was fresh, tempura was lightly coated, chicken wings coating was tasty and the vegetables and stir fry perfectly cooked.  Will definitely try this place a second time!"}
{"text":"A general 'Chinese' food place that recently opened in the area. The portions are great, I ordered the pad thai and was full after eating only a quarter of the dish. Unfortunately, the flavour was off and it wasn't really that authentic. The color tipped me off the moment the dish arrived at the table, the noodles had the artificial orange color that comes from using ketchup in the sauce. One taste confirmed that theory, with the predominant flavour being sweet and sour.... It just wasn't what good pad thai should taste like. 

They seem to want to cover all the different cuisines, but not quite delivering well on any of them. I had Thai, while my friends had Vietnamese pho and Malaysian skewers. The general consensus was \"Meh. Mediocre\". Maybe we haven't stumbled across the star dish from the restaurant or they need to promote some star dishes that they do exceptionally well."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant twice now in hopes to give them a good review but alas... 

The first time I came here I ordered the pho with beef. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either. I would say it was pretty ordinary but at $10+ it's kind of overpriced for some average pho. 

Tonight I went in hoping for a better experience.  I asked the waitress for a suggestion on what to order. She gave me at least one for each section of the menu. I was hoping for a dish that would be a clear favorite but it was not to be. I ended up ordering the Vietnamese spring rolls as a starter and the house special fried rice. The spring rolls were ordinary, bland and the shell wasn't that crispy. The fried rice was much tastier but it's simply more expensive than most other places. 

Each time I have visited this place there were hardly any customers. This time I was the only patron in the building.  I hope that the quality of the food improves and their prices go down or else they will.

*Update: Jan 9, 2017* \"FOR LEASE\" signs have appeared in the establishment's windows.  Sad to see but I can't say I'm surprised."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food!! We decided to try it out one evening and were pleasantly surprised.

The service was excellent, food amazing, as well as the price. 

We order all the time."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times in the past few months. The quality of the food has always been top notch and the service is quite attentive. I know some reviewers have mentioned that it is a bit pricey. It is more expensive than most takeout places in the area; but it is not takeout. There are nice table cloths, plates, cutlery etc. You do need to pay for the upgrade from takeout!"}
