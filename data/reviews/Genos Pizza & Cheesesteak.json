{"text":"I just ordered a cheesesteak and it was one of the worst I have ever seen in my whole life. I lived outside of Philadelphia the capital of cheesesteaks and I owned 3 pizzeria and Italian restaurant and we made cheese steaks. We make cheese steaks the old fashion way we use fresh ribeye meet we shave the meat real thin..we drizzle  olive oil cooked it up onions cheese whiz or provolone whatever they want on it I know a good cheesesteak and Genos  does not make good cheese steaks. I also noticed they use a conveyor belt oven to cook their pizza forget about it you cannot make a good pizza in a conveyor belt oven.. That's why they could afford to charge $5 for pizza because they use inferior ingredients to make it ...Needless to say they will never see me again"}
{"text":"Good pizza for cheap. The gluten free pizza is good, especially for the price, but be careful of toppings  Staff doesn't know what is gluten free and what isnt. We have always been happy with service and food except our more recent order they put pepperoni on the gluten free pizza by mistake then didnt even know if the pepperoni was gluten free or not. Didnt even apologize for the mistake. Only refunded the $ for the 'extra topping'."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and half to be delivered and the boneless wings and cheese bread weren't cooked all the way.. Never will I spend my money here again..."}
{"text":"Needs zero stars Flies everywhere  Tables unclean Lazy waitress who sat the whole time and ignored phones and said dirty tables. We had the 'Famous Philly' (steak or chicken with cheese sauce and grilled onions). It was over $18 for us to eat. For that price we could have eaten at Firehouse or Barro's Pizza. The chicken on the sandwich can easily be explained as store bagged chicken you find with the nasty processed lunch meats. The onions...good lord. They still had the peel on them! The cheese sauce was like cheap cafeteria fake cheese. The whole thing tasted cheaper than a middle school cafeteria lunch. I would rather have cafeteria food than this ever again. I would not recommend this to anyone ever. Not even starving college students. Who ever gave this more than a 1-2 star review; liars. Or you got lucky and was there on a good day."}
{"text":"So, I'm not trying to be funny when I say this But I wish I could have gave this place  Zero Stars. As far as the Service it wasn't that great but l i'll give them the benefit of the doubt since its new and they have Teens working up front. It was my first time going there so I wish she told me I could have a flavor crust she told the two people after me thou. And one of them got there Pizza before me not sure how that happen The pizza wasn't good at all to be honest but  $5.00 Large 1 topping pizza  you can't expect Greatness but I do expect better then that. Now on to the Philly Cheesesteak Hands down one of the worst Cheesesteaks I've had if not the worst. I had the Philly Cheesesteak  with Grilled onions and Cheese Sauce. There was not one good thing about it, The bread was nasty and hard, there wasn't enough meat, Not sure if it was the Cheese or the Meat but it was was very salty. Its over priced also 7 bucks for a 8\"in.. If was just want a Cheap pizza and don't care about taste I'll say got for it. But do not waste your money on the Philly Cheesesteak"}
{"text":"Deceiving..I thought  I was excited and thought this was the same company as the original gino's pizza in South Phoenix...I was wrong, way wrong... the pizza I got was some kind of greasy mess that made me sick for the better part of the next day...you have been warned"}
{"text":"Literally the WORST dinning experience of my life! The order was promised for 20mins, my husband went to pick it up and waited for 1 1/2 hours. This might not have been so bad if they were busy(they weren't) or if the food was good when we got it...it wasn't. The chicken wings were actually not even cooked and looked so disgusting we threw them away. The fries were also not cooked, and the cheese steak tasted gross and was cold. The only part of our order that was remotely edible was the pizza, but it certainly wasn't good just didn't think it would give the kids salmonella like the rest of the order. Do not waste your time or money this place is sure to be shut down soon. We called and had them refund our money."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went there to treat our baby sitter to a night out as a thank you for watching our son. While there we ordered a steak and cheese sub that came out burnt, both the roll, and the meat. My fiances ceaser salad had no croutons when it clearly states it comes with croutons.. When we asked about it, the girl working there told us it didn't come with them, even though it says it on the menu, which we showed her, it didn't change her mind.  While waiting for the terrible experienced food, our babysitter asked if they were hiring, the two cooks went on to make fun of her for being overweight saying she would just get bigger if she was hired.  Directly after our experience, we wrote corporate a letter explaining our experience, and did not receive a response to attempt and rectify the situation.  We will not be visiting this establishment again, which is a shame because we had only heard good things about the place."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because we love the food but the service stinks. Love the food and the ranch is amazing. Just don't expect friendly service."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!!! My husband and I were trying Genos for the first time and when we walked in, there were signs all over the sodas that said \"out of order\" so I thought oh maybe I just should drink soda today. We placed our order-2 cheesesteaks and we sat down to watch the march madness action. We were quickly told they were out of steak and they asked if we wanted chicken. No dude, it's a cheesesteak. The people working were young kids who couldn't have cared less. We got our money back and are heading to another place. Do not go there, you'll waste your time!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is don't waste you money purchasing pizza from there if you want better pizza go to the Bashas  next door to  Genos and buy a frozen tostinos pizza at least they have cheese on that pizza. We purchased pizza and they completely screwed our orders up charging more that what was on the menu price they completely forgot to cut one pizzas and pretty sure they forgot to add cheese to a couple of them also. Let's just say you get what you pay for cheep pizza with out flavor. I Called and spoke to the manager and the manager argued with me not allowing me to even speak a full sentence."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas for delivery today and was told 1 hour wait, pizza showed up almost a hour and a half later. Person who delivered was during like a mad man and you could tell as soon as you opened the box. Pizza was cold, go figure. I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"if I could give more stars I would.  This place is awesome!!!! Their Gluten Free Pizza is actually pizza!  Its the best Ive ever had.  I just moved down the street and Ive already eatn there 4 times!!!  THANKS GENOS!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice with my son, large slice of pizza, generous toppings, a tad on the greasy side, but most likely due to the pepperoni.  all in all, thought it was good.  Food came out quickly, will stop in an try something else next time... Oh yea, no fountain drinks..... For me a negative"}
{"text":"Have been going here for a long time is our Monday dinner usually until one day I ordered the normal food pizza wings and ranch fries. The food wasn't the problem it was the piece of splintering wood that was in the French fries. I have no clue what this could be from or how it had ended up in our French fries. Luckily my wife noticed it cause if one of my children had tried to it, it would have been bad! My wife called to complain and talked to the so called manager and received nothing but attitude. So after arguing with them. The so called manager had said next time you order we will help you out somehow and will leave notes in system under our number. It was October 10th and after a few weeks without eating there I said I will call and try it again. So just called and received attitude and no notes in the computer under my name. Never going back to this place and neither should you. It's one thing to have something in your food as stuff happens but it's another to get nothing but disrespect and no customer service over something the company did. I have pictures of the wood and receipt but no customer service."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from Geno's in the past and it's always been great! I go traditional Provolone Philly. The husband gets a Mushroom Philly. We are a little high maintenance and both sandwiches have some special requests. Well, tonight we placed our order on grub hub and when it arrived it was wrong. Sad face.  So, I called Geno's and they were so sweet and apologetic and offered to remake it and deliver it themselves. I was just so happy to have it coming my way (again)! Happy face!  When it arrived and I untied the bag, they had sent not 1, but 2 delicious brownies along with the CORRECT order!!  Amazing customer service Geno's!!! You made a friend for life!"}
{"text":"I normally go in here to get pizza good food however I called to get a delivery and was told it was a $15 min. What I wanted to order was close to that charge however the so called manager that gave his name as Chuck didn't want to change the fee. After asking several times to speak to his manager and being told he was the manager I was given to another person who told me the other persons name was not Chuck. I have met the owner prior and feel this restaurant is a good place and great food however I was treated badly on the phone for my delivery order and hung up because of the so called $15 dollar min. The first time I called I knew what I wanted and they tried to change it to the $ 5 dollar pizza's even though I didn't want that. The customer service at this location is very poor and the owner who I met prior needs to get it changed"}
{"text":"We left Philly 18 months ago. It's been a long, difficult journey. Through the miracle of the postal system, and the grace of God, we were able to acquire Tastykakes until luck and the economy expanded distribution further west and we could buy them locally. One time we found frozen scrapple, and that was good! These provisions were enough to stave off the cravings, but as time passed, the hunger grew worse. We listened to \"Eye of The Tiger\", and sang the theme song to Fresh Prince more times than I care to remember... But it wasn't enough, and every day that went by we fought harder against the longing that was slowly driving us insane. With desperation in our eyes, we found ourselves pacing the frozen food isle of our grocery store like caged beasts, our eyes fixated on the Steakums. We had become mad creatures obsessed with only one goal: cheesesteaks. Once we even tried chopping chicken breasts, buying provalone, and grilling onions to make our own, but the bread was all wrong... It wasn't right. The hunger continued. Then providence brought us to Mesa, and all our luck changed! On the third night, we found ourselves at Geno's, and on that night, our hunger was at long last satisfied!! HALLELUJAH WE FOUND CHEESESTEAKS!  With bellies full of food, and hearts bursting with nostalgia, we happily slipped a take out menu into our pockets and lumbered our way home with the best case of The Itis the world has ever known.  We will be back."}
{"text":"great cheese steaks and 5 dollar pizza is good deal for the price!"}
{"text":"Mushroom Philly is good....get the whiz on the side. Also had the bacon ranch fries which are good as well"}
{"text":"I have the Philly cheesesteak what's that impressed it was okay just okay not as good as the Original Gino's also have the pizza here because the key and it's okay not as good as the Original Gino's"}
{"text":"At first I wasn't impressed. Right when we walked in, all we saw was flies everywhere and it was a little warm. The staff didn't seem to care and weren't professional... Despite all of that, the food was great and the prices are very cheap! I will return and I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and also my last time!!! My kids usually DESTROY a Pizza when we get it for dinner, but they didn't even finish one slice. They said it was gross. Pizza literally had no flavor and I got jipped on my order! One of my pizzas had no dough in the center, literally just crisp cheese on the bottoms and my 10 piece zucchini gave me 8 pieces and 2 sad pieces of breading. Seriously if you're going to charge me $5.00 for an order of zucchini, at least give me all 10 pieces! I feel like driving back and returning this crappy food, but I don't feel like making a scene. I was a 1st time customer here and they made a horrible 1st impression. I regret coming here, leaving a tip in the tip jar and not going to Venezia's down the street instead!!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza!  Great price! We love that we can order the giant pizza for get togethers!"}
{"text":"Called on a Sunday Night at 8:10pm. They close at 8:45pm. Tried to order a philly and was told the grill was shut down?? Horrible service!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give one star. We came here with 45 mins before my sons football game. 35 mins of waiting later we asked how much longer, and they hadn't even started our pizza,they said. So we said we had to go our son now has 5 mins to get to his game and has not eaten anything. My 5year old daughter is starving... Asked for our money back and they gave us just the money for the pizza and not the money back on the drinks! Lmao are they joking!  They didn't even say sorry once! This place is a joke, no customer service period.  Everyone in there called in their orders and still had to wait once they got there. Pretty sure the guy gave our pizza to one of them because he forgot to make theirs.  Sux !!! Thanks a lot guys!"}
{"text":"This place gives you pizza for a good price.  It's just that- pizza.  Don't expect something outstanding for $5.  It fills you up and gives you an inexpensive dinner when you don't want to cook.  My husband did like the flavor of the cajun breadsticks.  Perks: Choose to have a flavor dusted on your pizza crust.  Staff was nice when we picked up our order and it seemed clean."}
{"text":"Well now  I know why I couldn't get through on the phone, not because they were super busy, it must be a marketing ploy.  Came inside, ordered my pizza and watched.  Girl at the counter answered and immediately said please hold.  She then picked up her cell phone, did something on it and walked to the back, while the call is still on hold.  She comes out from the back  and a pizza comes up for the only other person working so she gets it to him.  Waits another 30 seconds then picks up the call.  Pizza was not great for the wait.  Go to Little Caesars"}
{"text":"I picked up a large 2 topping pizza for $7.70.  I thought the pizza was great.  My wife and son on the other hand, did not care for it.  I think it was due to the rosemary herb that is in their sauce.  I think it adds a great flavor.  Much better than Little Ceasar's and the same price.  I will be going back, although I i will try sandwiches for my wife and son next time.  Good pizza, especially for the $."}
{"text":"What they lack in urgency and punctuality they make up for with taste. I ordered for delivery at 737pm ... Received at 9:05pm. We called and were told we were suppose to be the first stop and they were going to call the driver and call us back... Waited a couple mins and had no call back so we called again and I had every intention of canceling my order. Steve told me they were remaking the sandwiches and he was going bring them himself. The subs were hot and delicious. You can't beat it for the price. I sincerely hope they are able to get the delivery thing down better. I wouldn't of been so upset if someone would of called and told me they were running later. Everyone was really friendly also, no one gave us bad attitude or anything when we were obviously frustrated, they were also apologetic. We will most likely order again."}
{"text":"Called to order cheestesteaks for delivery and we were asked if we'd like to put a tip on the card in advance. Ummm.. No! WTF kind of question is that!? Who tips anyone before the delivery/ service has been done?   Not me!  Well it must have pissed them off because they called back to tell us they were out of steak!!  We're done here."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak.  I was wandering the neighborhood looking for something for dinner that wasn't a chain. I spotted Genoa's and decided to give it a try. Flavorful and generous portions."}
{"text":"Only thing good there is the pizza don't eat the  brownies don't eat the cheesesteak or any of the sandwiches because you're going to have buyers remorse just eat the pizza and enjoy life. ... :)"}
{"text":"Why 4 stars you ask? The cook came out and chatted a little bit with me when asking about Rosatis Pizza and where it went.    My only critique is the inside, after having sitting in there for 10 minutes it was hot in there ( hot enough to break out in a small sweat ). No not because of the hot pizza, probably because the ac temp was set above 80°.   The pizza slices where generous in size and hot! Sunday afternnoon with noone in front of me. I got my pizza in 5-8 minutes. Paid 6 somethin for 2 slices. C'mon by and give em a try!"}
{"text":"first and foremost I love Genos Tempe and Gilbert! so when I saw this open next to my dads place I was like pops we need to take you there, well this one not as good as the others  it is smaller it is in a old take out pizza joint but size shouldnt matter then i see the menu is slightly different they only have one size cheese steak which is strange to me.  The cheese steak the bread was slightly stale and this place does not compare with the meat portion that the others give you at Tempe and Gilbert you have to use a fork because of all the excess meat   whoever is in charge of this location thumbs down!"}
{"text":"i second the \"better than little ceasars for a 5 dollar pizza\"just phone it in.. its not cold n ready like little ceasars. good for quick cheap dinner on the busy/lazy nights"}
{"text":"this place has no idea what they are doing. ran my card 2 times because kid who took order did not know what he was doing. then they screwed order up and left half my food getting cold while i waited. will never come back. go to power rd and mckellips. worth the drive"}
{"text":"We like the pizza. The service sucks. Air heads running the front, people who don't care making the pizza. Last weekend, Friday night, was told we could not order a pick up order because they were closing in 20, we were less than 5 minutes away and of course, would not deliver. The next day, placed a pick up order for a birthday party. Arrived 20 minutes later to pick up and they never started my order. Tonight, thought we would give them one more chance and the idiot that answered the phone was just simply an idiot. She kept repeating that I couldn't get a gluten free pizza for $5. I know this. Repeated to her that I wanted both regular and gluten free pizza and she could not comprehend. We're done. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"We ordered the famous philly and it was dry, and unenthusiastic. Also ordered the cheese fries and ended up having to put on more cheese when I got it home because there was barely any on them! The place itself was dumpy and dirty. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is your typical bargain basement super quick pizza shop, think gas station pizza. For the price it is hard to beat. The flavor is average at best. The guy who helped me at the register was extremely helpful and certainly knowledgeable about his menu. The place was clean. I doubt i would try it again, but it definitely serves its purpose in the world for the  situations it calls for."}
{"text":"would love to review this restaurant.  However when I drove there to get supper it was closed even though the signage said they didnt close for another hour."}
{"text":"Had steak hoagie. Was ok nothing special. Service was ok. We also ordered pizza....whoa big mistake..  1 notch above cardboard."}
{"text":"This Genos is a complete dump. Rude and nasty service from the girl at the front who doesn't let you speak.  Long wait for a crappy pizza.  And every table in the dump was trashed, with no attempt by any employee to clean them.  Every time I've stepped into this place is the same. Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered a philly with chicken instead of steak and provolone cheese. One of the tastiest chicken phillys I've ever had. Chicken was tender and flavorful and cooked perfectly. The portion was generous as well.   Geno's looks like some huge national chain,, but it's a small local chain owned by a few different people. I've never once been disappointed by their food or service. This location is no exception and I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Prolly the slowest service I've ever seen. I'm here now. Phone orders trump in store customers. I ordered fries to eat while I waited. They said they will be ready in 20 min?"}
{"text":"My sister takes care of a teenage boy who will only eat Geno's pizza. She brought some home one day and told me that I had to try it. The pizza was pretty good, but paired with the ranch it was awesome! We also had the garlic bread which was really yummy. Definitely going there again!"}
{"text":"had delivery last night - steak, cheese and mushroom hoagie was delicious!  took about 30-40 min for 3 cheesesteaks and bacon ranch fries.  Guy on the phone said the menu online is incorrect, though."}
{"text":"The pizza is great!!! Being a lover of NY Style pizza, I enjoy what Geno's is making up. Went the first time on the recommendation of a few friends who said they have tried al least half the menu; was not disappointed.  Have to admit, THE BEST $5.00 in town!!!   Staff is friendly, but the place can be a bit warm inside during the summer - this is the norm for ANY take out pizza joint with a sit in - it's the ovens, and to keep it cooler I  sure would have the AC cranking all day - not good for the wallet, or environment.    Btw, as I am sure this guy will write a review (and I will not call this guy a gentleman, no stretch of the imagination could classify him as such). He came in with an order that he claims had no steak on his Philly. Was not polite, was not trying to be cool and work it out. He just swore at the manager on duty, and degraded the entire staff with EXTREMELY!!! vulgar slurs - EVEN AFTER THEY OFFER ED TO REMAKE AND COMP HIS ORDER!!! He even DEMANDED FOOD VOUCHERS AFTER THE FULL REFUND!!! As well demanaded the cooks be fired on the spot. He gave complete disregard to the myself, or the modestly dressed 80yo lady during the onslaught. Personally,  the dude needs lay off the juice, or get laid stat.  Anyway, I raise the aforementioned matter because even with this barrage the young manager and her staff kept their cool, and handled the matter extremely well.   Happy customer with multiple visits - this one just really impressed me!!!  Like I said, good food, good staff... and every blue moon a jerked of a rude and disregarding customer."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have had  with a delivery service.  They declined to let me do carry out so I accepted delivery.  They said 30 to 40 min. Then charged me the $3 delivery charge.  Fine, an hour later no food so did a check up and was told delivery guy just left, 20 min later got a call can't find my house.  The guy tells me he's in front of my house, I'm standing outside and advice him he's not.  He spoke with a heavy accent and continued to argue that he was at my house.  I told him I would just go pick it up at the Genos because there was a communication gap.  The manager calls me and laughs because he can't understand his driver and his resoultion is he gives me 2 brownies and I still got billed for a delivery I picked up.  Well if you want people who lack communication and charge you to pick up your food for the delivery that was not delivered, well this is your spot, enjoy.  As for me, I'd rather get pizza from the meth-heads up the street walking around, at least they are prompt."}
{"text":"Great Food and Fast and Friendly Delivery!! Best Deal in town!!"}
{"text":"The grand opening was yesterday and we were there tonight!   My son got a $5.00 Large 1 topping pizza. He said it was good and ended up eating 1/2 of a large pizza!  I did the Provolone Cheese steak. Very good! Filled with lots of meat, peppers, onions, and Mayo! The bread wasn't soggy even though it was a little messy. I do think the peppers could be cooked a little more, they were crunchy and I don't like them like that. I will retry on the next visit.  Hubby got a steak, cheese, and mushroom. He said it was very good. He got the Onion rings and was disappointed. They were greasy and not as good as the one in Tempe.   We also got an order or cheese bread and it was awesome.  The can probably hold about 25 inside and they have tables outside which is where we sat since the weather was so nice.  Over all I wish them the best of luck and plan to go back again."}
{"text":"Way better than Little Ceaser's for $5 pizza. Thinner crust, tastier sauce and better quality cheese. So glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"Went to Geno's for lunch today. The food was great. The service was great, but there were these teenagers coming in and out of the store making a mess and complaining. I watched them use up a bunch of the free water cups on sodas and slushes and then get mad when the guy behind the counter said there weren't any left. I felt sorry for him. He was trying to work, but they kept bugging him for nothing. I would've been so stressed out, but he handled it great."}
