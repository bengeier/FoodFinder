{"text":"The best for breakfast. Love the home fries and hash. Very colorful little rustic place with great servers and food. The other day I had the dog with me and was dying for breakfast - Sandra actually walked my food out to the car!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for breakfast. Has been here for many many years and as popular as ever...  Not a fancy place but rather a local hangout with lots of character.  The food can be a bit greasy but it's always great.  Come with cash... Because they don't accept credit cards..."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was good, homemade tea tasted good. Honestly, we had no complaints about this restaurant. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"A lovely spot for a simple, home style breakfast.  Love the screened in porch and view of Surry Hill."}
{"text":"If you're from a small town like I am this place will take you back home. Took my daughter there for a birthday breakfast recently. She had a egg croissant sandwich and I had two eggs over medium grits bacon and sourdough toast. It was awesome. It really reminds me of the small restaurants in my home town in Western Pennsylvania.  take cash"}
{"text":"Don't usually give 5 stars, but in this case: * Excellent food * Excellent service * Great prices  * Fun, rustic and unique adventure  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"It seems like there's just about universal agreement the food at the Wagon Wheel is excellent, so I won't beat that drum. Let me address the concerns people have had about being an outsider.  I've lived near Cave Creek for a long time and for some reason never stopped here. I always got the sense that it was really a spot for \"real\" Cave Creekers, not those of us who live just south of town in the area that has a Cave Creek address but is really in Phoenix. We are pretenders.   However, I moved into Cave Creek proper just recently, right down the street from the Wagon Wheel, so figured I'd better check it out. After all, I'm one of the locals now, a \"real\"Creeker. I loved it. The place is the epitome of a \"greasy spoon.\"  The few people there (it was around 10am) were clearly locals and regulars who looked like they've been coming since the gold rush of the 1870's. Nobody looked at me funny when I walked in and I never felt out of place. Maybe they saw me pull up in my old pickup truck and figured I was OK.  I was immediately greeted and told to sit anywhere I'd like. The place is small, but there are tables outside in an enclosed patio. Service was friendly and prompt, and my coffee cup was never empty.  Would I drive any distance to eat here? Probably not. Would I make it a point to eat breakfast here if I was going to be visiting Cave Creek? Absolutely. Will I become a regular now that I live down the street? You bet.   So don't be afraid to pull up in your Lexus, wearing your Tommy Bahama shirt, pressed linen shorts and Docksiders. You'll still be welcomed by all of us regulars!"}
{"text":"Came for pancakes - no pancakes today. Asked for a taste of the sausage gravy - cook said $1 for a side of gravy. Omelettes came out cold. Biscuits and gravy cold too. Toast was stale. Either no A/C or too cheap to use it. Waitress was nice.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"One thing I can say about this place is you will always get good service and very good food. No matter what you order all of it is good. Now this is no up scale place its old and has a lot of history. But if you are looking for a good meal and an honest price this is it. REAL food made not frozen and per-packaged and heated up in the so called kitchen. REAL food that tastes good."}
{"text":"It was Sunday morning -- Fathers Day -- and my wife and I were looking for a place to have breakfast. We had both been doing the Ideal Protein Diet and were looking for a basic breakfast that would minimize carbs. After reading Yelp reviews, we decided upon Wagon Wheel. What a great decision that was! Our host/waitress, Megan, was outstanding! She was friendly, full of energy and gave us lots of information about shopping options in the area. The food was basic and outstanding. We had some of the best omelettes that we have had in years. The price for the food was very reasonable. We felt a homey atmosphere in the place. It certainly reminded us of finding that one locals diner that is a hidden gem. It is certainly not a fancy place if that is what you are looking for, but had a great combination of food, price and atmosphere. I will definitely return on my next trip to the area."}
{"text":"While I only rate three stars I would definitely return!  It's a bit rustic yet mostly clean.  Our server was great though some would pre judge her for all of the ink on her arms.  However she was very bubbly, efficient and attentive!  Our party of four ate hearty breakfasts with meats, potatoes eggs, a couple of half orders of biscuits and gravy all for $31.00. Order was brought out within ten minutes of ordering, hot, eggs cooked perfectly and coffee fresh and hot!  Bathrooms are quaint but clean."}
{"text":"Omg...horrible! On our way Cave Creek, and thought we would stop at small dinner for breakfast off of highway....at first look... the establishment was filthy. ..The one waitress appeared to be on crack or some kind of speed... we placed our order...and several people came in after us .... we waited approx 45 to 50 minutes for our food and 3 people who came in after  us was served before us.... then when our food did come our order was all wrong... food was not even worth it. Then to finalize the horrible experience the bill was wrong... and not in our favor.....horrible, horrible....DONT GO THERE. ...!!"}
{"text":"This definitely exemplifies \"Cave Creek quaint\". The experience began by a greeting from a local-looking waitress with a mullet.  She cracked  jokes that weren't funny. The breakfast (I think that's all they serve) was definitely a good value.  The ham and eggs were very good, the coffee was regularly filled. The pancakes were a little dry. The home fries (don't say hash browns--you'll be corrected like a 4th grader) were great.  All-in-all, a place I would recommend, even though I got the feeling I was treated like an outsider and not a local, even though I am a local."}
{"text":"Very strange morning asked the server for my omelette to be cooked light however it was overcooked and she said she would have the kitchen to redo it. When she came back to the table she said the owner that is the cook said he wasn't going to remake it.     Very wierd since we live here all year around you would think we would be treated better than the tourists.  Shame on the owners to act like this!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Denny's don't go here. If you are into a family owned greasy spoon with great service & great food, this place is great."}
{"text":"Great place..Friendly service and prices are very reasonable. Pancakes are delicious !!"}
{"text":"What a great small town place for breakfast.  Our group came rumbling in on a Saturday morning needing seats for 12.  When we first walked up I was thought there was no way in hell we were going to be seated together.  To my surprise they had plenty of space in the back room for  us.    The servce was ok for our large group, and the food was outstanding.  Well, that is what I was told.  I didn't eat much because I was still recovering from the night before.  8)  I can't wait to actually try it."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Nice people with real food. It's not big, but just like having a great breakfast at home without the cleanup. And we don't have to make The iced tea that morning. The home fries are JUST what grandma made."}
{"text":"The positives: Eclectic group-let's just say a wide range of people.  Old cowboys come here to die, and literally new cowboys are being raised here from week 1.  Band-The band was decent and a nice touch.  Server-Our server was top notch.  Very nice genuine person.  Food-Decent. Not great but decent.  Negatives:  Dirty. This place needs to be cleaned. Actually filthy is a better word.   Bar service was extremely slow (15 min per a beer)"}
{"text":"Gritty is probably the best word to describe this place.  It's your real deal country restaurant.  You don't go for inventive menus or ingredients.  You go for the cowboy hat wearin' cook who just nods and smiles.   I enjoyed my pancake (which is more than enough for one person - they are big 'uns!).  It's a fun little morning adventure."}
{"text":"I am floored that we went here for breakfast and they said they stopped serving at 12:30. I don't understand why it was so hard - you can serve eggs at 12:29 but not at 12:30. I would think that a small local restaurant would want to build local customers. But I guess not. The last time we went to this place, YEARS ago, service took over 2 hours. We thought we would try them again. Never again. Sorry."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  It is a true hole in the wall joint, but the food is exactly what we like. My husband loves chicken fried steak and bisquits and gravy. He loved his. The serivce was perfect. As we were leaving 2 people on horses came and hitched the horses to the post.. It reminds you we live in the old wild west."}
{"text":"DON'T DO THIS TO YOUR SUNDAY MORNING.  This was the first time we went to the Wagon Wheel.  We saw it had good reviews.  We ordered and waited, and waited, and waited. All the other tables began filling up behind us.  We waited and waited and waited.  All the other tables that had arrived after us were served and leaving.  We kept asking and we were told it will only be a couple more minutes.   One hour later, another couple came in and sat at the booth across from us.  They ordered and the food arrives in 10 minutes and we still were not served. That was the last straw.  WE WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CAFE BECAUSE THE COOK COULDN'T GET 1 ORDER OF BISCUITS AND GRAVY ALONG WITH SOME BACON AND EGGS IN AN HOUR.  RUDE AND DISORGANIZED. Oh if you decide to ruin your Sunday morning at this café they only take cash.  Who does that??????"}
{"text":"Read up on the reviews since the wife and I moved here recently and enjoy breakfast out now and then. The reviews - all of them, are spot on. It's exactly as everyone described. The food was great, and at a great price. The decor and the staff were just as everyone had described.    If, when reading the reviews you are turned off, there's a nice place down the road by the 101 called the Rustic Cafe, where it's spotless inside, air-conditioned and they play Jesus music and all the church goers head there for brunch.   If you're still intrigued, like we were, then take a chance on the Wagon Wheel and you won't be disappointed.   We showed up at 7, and the lot was near empty but it filled up fast. We sat on the outdoor patio, a porch describes it better, since it was cool out and we could watch the passersby. Food was quick coming out, and it was delicious. Forgot our cash, so had to run home quick but the waitresses were understanding.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decor is scary. The waitress treats everyone that way, I stop there regularly. . She will also correct you if you say you want sausage patties, \"that's all we got\". I do it almost  every time I'm there just to hear her say it.  Great potatoes, great breakfast."}
{"text":"If you get off the 101 and head North on Cave Creek, pay close attention or you'll miss this little restaurant on the side of the road.  If even if you see it, you may be tempted to drive by and not look back, but that would be a mistake.  The food inside is definitely worth the stop.  They don't do anything fancy with the food.  They make standard breakfast fare, but do it very well.  I'm of the firm belief that fancy food isn't always better food, and I'll take this over a place that charges $20+ per person for breakfast any day.  The food was fresh and fast, and our waitress Megan was great.  Very helpful, excellent service, and willing to offer suggestions if you need them.  I've noticed some of the other reviewed commenting that the place is dirty, but I think they don't know \"dirty\" from \"old.\"  It's definitely rustic with old west decor.  They can seat large or small parties, and have a large dining area in the back of the restaurant.  Stop by and check them out, it's worth it.  Just be sure to watch out for the entrance...it's a steep slope!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. Warm to the wise; if you're expecting Denny's or IHOP, you're not getting it. This place is as divey as it comes and we love it. Its small, its congested, but it IS delicious! Cash only, bring the appetite. Support small business'."}
{"text":"A local favorite, this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint.  I orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast.  The food was cooked to order- hot, tasty and the bacon was thick, crisp and flavorful, just like I hoped it would be.   The waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us.  They chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home.  One reminder if you go..... bring cash.  No crest or debit cards taken here!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly, tasty breakfast for two for $24 including tip. We will go again. Everything was good. Hubby had French toast, I had the two egg breakfast.  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Wagon Wheel is a throwback to the small town diner you remember from growing up. Take a step back in time and enjoy the hole in the wall that the locals visit regularly.   Just know what to expect. It isn't a big chain restaurant, the building is old, the menu never changes, and they only take cash.  But as long as you aren't expecting some fancy Scottsdale place you will love it. The only time I hear other customers complain are people that don't appreciate what Wagon Wheel is.   We come every weekend for breakfast, and the waitresses know our names, and our orders.   So take a trip up Cave Creek Rd, and give it a try. I wish more places like this have survived the decades."}
{"text":"Throwback to the diners of old. Great food and very reasonable prices.  I had some of the best chicken fried steak I've ever had. Kids had pancakes and bacon and it was all great. The wife had a Spanish omelet and everyone was happy.  Our waitress was fun and seemed to really enjoy her job. Great atmosphere and yes it's the definition of a dive!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a mom & pop with lots of character. The food is simple but tasty basic breakfast items. There's typically mostly locals there. It's my go to place for a local breakfast. Their prices are good also."}
{"text":"Simple \"short order\" menu. Good food, great service and priced right!! Very friendly staff. Pleasant environment. Takes me back to the \"good ol' days\"."}
{"text":"Geez, Mike D. TMI, TMI. But I guess it's good information for the X chromosome- but do guys really care how clean your bathroom is or how tightly the door closes??? Okay, I digress. Well, Mike D. the Y- bathroom was just fine. Not fancy but clean.  And the door closes.  Sorry folks for the banter before I write about the food and service.  Our group was running Ragnar and we came in here looking for a warm and hearty breakfast. I think the state we were in, anything would have tasted out of this world. And it did! Service was friendly, helpful. The food came out fast. The price extremely reasonable.  I love places like the Wagon Wheel where the moment you walk in, they treat you like an old friend regardless of how you look, dress, or smell.  Not only do you get a great serving of food, you get a great serving of human decency as well. And that's worth any price and I'm sure that's one of many reasons why they have many regulars.  It was my first and only time here but I reckon places like these has its regulars and loyal following since I know if I lived close by, this place would be my regular go to place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We decided to visit the Cave Creek area and stumble upon this gem through Yelp of course! It's a hole-in-the-wall place (our favorite kind) and it has a heck of a sharp turn from the main road to get in and into the parking lot (imagine yourself making a u-turn but with only 100 feet to do it).    It looks like an older house that has been converted into a restaurant.  I'd love to find out the history of this location.  The feel is actually pretty southern when you walk in.  There is a fun patio, with only a hand full of tables, and with nice weather like this they will fill up fast!  We decided to sit inside to get a real feel for the restaurant.    Meghan was the best - if you go here - ask for her!  She greeted us warmly.  Patiently waited to take our order as we perused the menu options and checked in on us enough to be wonderful and not overwhelming.    I had the French Toast (2 slices) for just $3.50! He had the He Person breakfast, which was two enormous pancakes, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage patties and toast.  They were both delicious.  The french toast was made with Texas Toast and was sweet enough to satisfy a craving, but not overly so that it was too much after a few bites.  He had so much food he didn't make it but about half way through his pancakes and threw in the white towel.  Yes, it's an old building.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall that looks like it could use a new coat of paint, a better parking lot and a pressure washer.  BUT that would take all the unique aspects of this place away, and where is the fun in that??  If you want a chain restaurant, this isn't it and that's exactly why we loved it!  Overall: A+   Good food. Friendly faces. Old charm."}
{"text":"Loved this little place ! Directly across the road from our home. Service was great and the food was great. If you are a morning potato person , get the home fries ( the bomb ) ! Definitely one of those little hole in the walls that you don't want to miss out on !"}
{"text":"Good food.good people .reasonably priced. very very casual dress. very small .could use a good scrub down! but the food was tasty."}
{"text":"It's my first stop for breakfast on each visit. Reminds me of our neighborhood cafe in Montana.  A hole in the wall favorite right off the highway.   The gal who took our order both times is so friendly and on the move. People are constantly coming and going. Small restaurant with some seating area tucked behind what you see when you walk in.   I had good old ham and eggs. Plain and simple - it's home cooking. Already looking forward to our next visit and my first breakfast and coffee at Wagon Wheel."}
{"text":"Rustic, old, family owned business that you cannot find anymore. Yes the Decour is an old greasy spoon look, something from the 50s, but that is the charm of the place. You have Family members serving you here, while dad cooks in the kitchen. This is not gourmet food, this is good solid morning breakfast, with the best pancakes in town, for no money. When your check comes, you will see why this is easily the best bargain in Arizona. How many breakfast places, in this area, can you sit while somebody hovers over your coffee glass making sure it is never empty with a pleasant friendly smile. These types of businesses are almost nonexistent now. A great experience for your family especially kids who can see what real service looks like, instead of going to McDonald's for unhealthy food destined to give you heart disease. If you are snobby people, you will hate it here. Go to Tonto and blow all the cash you want on overpriced food, pre-made and frozen. Wagon Wheel, is the real deal."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we visited our old favorite. This is a mom and pop and daughter and friends greasy spoon. Nothing fancy and that's the charm. Food is fast and fresh. If you are looking for an old school diner for breakfast or lunch this is the place. This is a hole in the wall that exudes a family's love to feed the neighborhood. Bring cash, cause it's cash or wash dishes. Coffee's hot and the ice tea has my favorite crushed ice. Did I mention it's reasonably priced too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went out looking for pancakes one Sunday morning my BF and I.   We decided to give The Wagon Wheel in Cave Creek a try.   Big mistake.  Lets just say that if you like to eat at a clean establishment, this is not your place.   If you like the sight of cockroaches inches away from where you're eating, this definitely your place.   I'm embarrassed to say that I still tried their food; the pancakes where alright, but as soon as I felt a lump of unmixed batter, I spat it out immediately thinking the worst."}
{"text":"Yum. We shared green chili burger and fries and chicken fried steak and eggs. Plenty if food. Homemade unsweet tea. Service was a little slow but super friendly. My husband loved the gravy and said he's trying the biscuits and gravy next time. We sat outside and the breeze was so nice. Read the fun facts on the back if the menus."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Family ran with attention to simple flavor that is not over loaded with salt.  Eggs were cooked to perfection and bacon was crispy with good flavor. Pancakes were fluffy and good flavor.  Will def go back again."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try this diner and found it to be an adorable hole-in-the-wall. The prices are great ($1.00 for a cup of coffee). The food is excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been on yelp this long and have yet to review the Wagon Wheel! This is one of those places that I will take anyone I know to just so they can get a great meal. Yes, a certain waitress here loves to joke and it can feel a little rude but that's just how she is. The food is more than worth it though, and the price! I usually get a half order of biscuits and gravy, and a half order of french toast. Both are around $3 so in total my meal is $6 plus a drink. The lemonade here is delicious, not too sweet and has a hint of lime that is very refreshing.   The best place to sit is outside on the enclosed patio and enjoy the fresh mountain air and light traffic. If it's a weekend you will see, and hear plenty of motorcycles!  P.S. they are CASH ONLY so make sure you come prepared."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small, with 6 four person booths and a few two person booths inside, 4 stools to belly up to the counter and booths outside. It is old, but I consider it charming. They aren't messing around here! They are open for breakfast and lunch, closing at 1pm and only accept cash. I had the corned beef hash and eggs, no toast. The corned beef hash was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside...perfect! The eggs were cooked in oil, just like grandma used to make them. It is a three person operation, at least that's how many people I saw behind the scenes. One cook, one hostess, one waitress. I can't wait to come back to try the other menu options. UPDATE: I had the western omelette and it was just like mom used to make! It was a good size, without the toast or home fries."}
{"text":"Yes, we love this little local family owned place.  We don't go for the decor, thats for sure.  However recently prices have skyrocketed there, especially when coffee is now $2.  We love our hostess Sandra. The food always comes out hot, consistent, and fresh tasting.  The cook was a recent head chef with the Hilton hotels and knows what he is doing.  If you don't mind the old outdated atmosphere and want great hot food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the road but nice and clean inside. Great biscuits and gravy and the best bacon ever. I will be back."}
{"text":"Walked in with a group of 10 on a Sunday morning and we were seated immediately. We pretty much had one of everything on the breakfast menu and there was nothing but silence as everyone enjoyed there food. I had the pancakes and they were fluffy and light and you could taste that they were made from scratch and not a mix. My brother in-law had the biscuits and gravy and he loved them my mother in-law had the French toast and loved it as well."}
{"text":"Hidden in Plain Sight, I have driven by this place that is just before you get into Cave Creek proper for 3 years now. Shares an unpaved parking lot with a Body Shop I think. But the locals know about it, been there for 27 years!  NOT Fancy, but good breakfast food (great coffee too!) at very reasonable prices prepared by a former Camelback Inn Head chef!!!! Clean and friendly place. Work trucks to Mercedes in the parking lot.  Should be on an episode of Dives and Dinners!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall breakfast joint but also probably one of the best places to get your traditional breakfast or lunch in Cave Creek. Prices are the best cash only! I frequent this place! They also have very good fast friendly service! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Wagon Wheel is one of those places that you can get away with doing what your mother taught you not to do -- judge a book by its cover.  From the outside, it is a cozy (read as somewhat cramped in front, although I caught a glimpse of a back room that was not lit or being utilized) breakfast joint with a old small western town feel to it... and it does not pretend to be anything other that.    It's not the cleanest place you could go to for breakfast, but the portions are large, the prices are extremely reasonable, and the food is good!    I had the He-man combo that included two eggs (cooked to order), two sausage patties, two pieces of deliciously delicious bacon, and two pancakes.  All for around $8.    Every table had two types of hot sauce on it and the eggs were a bit bland before adding said hot sauce.  I substituted extra bacon for my sausage, but did try a bite of a fellow diner's sausage and it was slightly spicy better than it looked!  The bacon... oh, the bacon.  I just love bacon and this hit the spot.. so let's leave it at that.  The pancakes... as big as the plate they are served on and I can't say that I am convinced that anyone could actually eat two of these monsters!  I like my pancakes a little soggy from maple syrup and these babies just absorbed it all in like a sponge.    Nothing was spectacular, but I felt like I got my money's worth with all that food and this place just provides that small-town rustic charm!  Megan, our server, did a good job with our group that was six people divided between two tables.  She actually handled every table in the restaurant (see again my earlier comment about this place being small).  She provided accurate service with a smile and that's likely why she is also mentioned in a couple other yelper reviews!  My only knock on the place was the lack of cleanliness.  It wasn't apparent everywhere, but the tiny men's bathroom was kind of disgusting.  And the door didn't close all the way... which is fine since I only had to do the \"number one\"... but it would not have been if I had to do the \"number two\"."}
{"text":"I am a regular here, best in house made chicken fried steak on the planet. The building is old, and so are the people who work and eat here... Not for yuppies or sissy's."}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Value! Excellent Service! (Cash ONLY) I can't say enough about this place. Yes, it might be considered a \"dive\". But really in this state of everything is new, It's a comfort to be in a \"dive\" cafe just like back on the east coast. You know the place. The most friendly wait staff, excellent Biscuits and Gravy and French toast. All for a really good price! My guy and I go there on Sunday and we never have a check over $21 for two meals and 2 beverages. Oh, and you all know how irritating it is to pay $2.99 for coffee or iced tea? (with refills). At the Wagon Wheel it's $1.50 for beverages. I don't know if that's a pet peeve of yours, but it is of mine!  Check this place out! But remember, they don't take Debit or credit, CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"We always go here when in Cave Creek. Today our waitress was not very friendly, my daughter noticed she just threw our utensils on the table when we sat down, my order didn't come out right, she said it would be awhile before they could fix it and left my plate on the table. I had to go take my plate to her. Then she looked annoyed I asked for my order to be fixed. I noticed she was pleasant to the other customers, I had to ask another waitress to refill our coffee. She is an older blonde waitress. I will find another place to have breakfast when in Cave Creek."}
