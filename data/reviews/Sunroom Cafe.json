{"text":"Delicious, fresh, vegetarian-friendly.

My favorite breakfast items include a hearty helping of their chocolate chip wheat cakes, an omelette with a side of delicious roasted potatoes, or a generously sized fruit plate and muffin.

For lunch, I recommend the turkey and mozzarella sandwich with a side of potatoes. My Wisconsin-born, meat-lover of a dad has raved about the vegan chili on multiple occasions. 

Delicious baked goods, good assortment of beverages. I've never been for dinner, but maybe I'll get there soon!

Not a great place for large groups on a busy Saturday morning, unless you'd like to wait a while. And this is not a place to go if you like to be waited on-- most times, they call you to the counter to pick up your food, you grab the silverware and condiments that you'll need, and you fill your own water glass. Sunday brunch is an exception. That being said, I highly recommend Sunroom for a casual and really tasty meal. Everyone there (staff and customers) is always polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Vegan-friendly, large menu.  I love their soups, hummus pita, and tofu scrambler.  Service is really good.  Kristen is the best- really great service and soooo sweet.  Sometimes can be really busy and take a while to order, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Tasty pasta, but the quiche has a weird sedimentary crust and they serve rocky roasty potatoes with EVERYTHING. Also the vegan soup usually... tastes it."}
{"text":"I love the Sunroom Cafe. I'm there nearly everytime I'm in Madison. Sitting above State Street with the sun steaming in, eating a reasonably priced breakfast just feels good. I disagree that it seems \"granola,\" but it's casual and laid back for sure."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for breakfast and dinner is probably underrated. Just nothing to really put it over the top. Food is OK. Location is nice. A change of pace from the bagels and pastries that are the only other options on this end of state street. Cheap eggs toast and potatoes special on weekdays."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, just terrible.  The bland food would be reason enough not to go there, but since there aren't any other breakfast spots on that end of State St., I've wandered in more than once out of desperation.  I am always upset that I did.  The service is horrible.  In addition to being rude, the owner is always trying to pull one over at the register.  He will try to overcharge or cheat you, so watch out - seriously.  I know what you are thinking, 'cheat me on eggs and hash browns?'.  Yes, on eggs and hash browns.  It is wild - and not in a good way.  More like in a 'elephant escaped from zoo, defecated on a plate and a nazi is forcing you to eat it' sort of way.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hang out places with my friends in town! It's a cozy place on State St on the second floor. So you can get one of the tables by the window and watch the crowd go by from a distance. Their entrance is easy to miss if you are not keeping a lookout, but they have signboards on the street so that helps. 

I like how their menu is very diverse. It's great for groups with varied preferences since everyone can almost certainly find something to their liking. Also great if you ar fickle-minded like me, who always cannot decide on what to settle for. They have Italian dishes like pizza and pasta, Mexican dishes like Quesadilla, a bunch of asian cuisines and some traditional american dishes like burgers etc to choose from. 

I love their pizza and pasta. Shrimp and avocado pizza is one of my favorites, the combination is soooo great I am surprised no other places I knew has tried emulating them. I also love their selection of sweets like cakes and muffins, really nice for a snack or dessert. 

I have tried their Sunday brunch as well. The food was great but it can get pretty busy  especially during semester time. I have hardly been there for lunch so can't really comment on that. Love the atmosphere for dinner ~~

It's a pity they started an additional charge for soup or salad to go with your main course. Would have given it five stars if the soup or salad came with the main course like it used to."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Madison.  I don't know much about what they serve for lunch or dinner, but they do breakfast until 2 pm each day, and I would highly recommend the breakfast options.  There are many different options to choose from with great vegetarian options too.  The omelettes are my favorite.  The service has always been fast and pleasant, whether you eat in or get it to go.  The prices are great as well.  If you get a window seat, you can look out over State Street and do some people watching.  It does get busy on weekends, but that's to be expected.  Definitely go a few times and check it out!"}
{"text":"Average breakfast food at best. Bizarre that there's no wait staff, so you pick up your own food and drinks. Surprised you don't have to bust your own table. Seems like the business model for the place is how can we make the most about of money with little effort. Come here if the better breakfast places are over crowded."}
{"text":"this place has an extensive brunch menu. granted, you can serve breakfast a hundred different ways, but they seem to have it down to a science. including their homemade cinnamon french toast.

the meal-partakers were sufficiently pleased with the buckwheat pancakes and huevos rancheros (with veggie chili). the salmon-bagel plate was excellent, though missing the cucumbers.

the pancakes arrived very late because the chef accidentally made their buttermilk cakes instead. they, nicely, gave us half off the order for the inconvenience.

as usual, they were packed to the gills. if we had been just a half hour later, we would have been among the many waiting in the stairwell for a seat. it's great food at an awesome price, but i don't know if i'd stand in a stairway for a half hour...

the bloody mary was mostly tomato juice... the coffee was very good. for the price, and if you have a small group, i'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh I love the Sunroom Cafe. Its a great little place thats easy to miss if you're walking down State St. Its located on the second floor, all they have out front is a yellow and black awning with a sign. Once you climb up the narrow dark stairs, you come up to a bright cheerful cafe! Its cozy, and decorated with local art.

I've been here many times for breakfast, a couple times for lunch, and once for dinner. I would say they are best known for their breakfast. It gets very crowded on weekend mornings, especially during Badger football game weekends. They have unique food combinations and they are always offering great daily specials. I always get the spinach, tomato, and goat cheese omelette. Comes with delicious house potatoes and toast! So yum!

Depending on how busy it is, you will either be seated by a waitress and order from him/her. Otherwise, if its not busy- you order up at the counter and they call your name when your food is ready.

The service is always great and the food is always delicious. Would recommend anytime."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sunroom for many years now and I really enjoy the food. The reason I rate this low is because of the service. I really do not understand how this place picks their waiters, their service is just going down. Here are a few of my recent experiences: 

1. I asked for a hummus platter and repeatedly mentioned my dietary restrictions, and I was served tuna salad. The waiters were all hanging out in the back and even the ones that came out wouldn't make an eye contact. After a long wait, my food was taken back. 

2. There is an ongoing debate about the Thai tofu noodle bowl. Some waiters convincingly say it has fish sauce and some equally convincingly say it doesn't. In fact if you mention this to one waitress, they start bitching about the other waitress. 

3. Recently I again made a visit, I specifically asked if the soup met my dietary restriction and the waitress went and double checked it for (apparently). However when I saw things floating in my soup and I couldn't get anyone's eye contact for a while, I had to walked up to the cashier. The cashier confirmed my suspicion that the waitress was wrong and it was all written very clearly on the menu blackboard. 

That is definitely the last time I am going there. If they had put a little more effort into training/quality I wouldn't have to face this situation multiple times."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous veggie burger. Different from any I have ever eaten (and I have eaten MANY). The mashed potatoes on the side were yummy and not salty at all. The atmosphere felt quite chill and provided a great view of State Street."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. This restaurant is absolutely disgusting! The tables are always dirty even after they are \"cleaned.\" The food is not fresh at all- over priced orange juice is store bought not even freshly squeezed. Wouldn't be surprised if the omelets come from a mix. To top it all off, the owner is a cheap ass hole and it definitely shows with the \"service\" you receive there. There are such great restaurants by the capitol, do not waste your money there."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of this place as I used to have weekly friday brunch with my girlfriends here.  Food is fresh and I always go for the special of the day.  I also have my Friday coffee here which is always good.  Definitely must try!!!I am a regular customer."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE. The old man taking the orders at the counter was extremely rude to me. Because of health reasons, I can't have fried potatoes so I asked him if I could substitute them. He abruptly replied with \"I don't know what you're asking.\" And he continues by telling me that I have to pay for a separate side of bacon. Okay, I honestly just wanted to substitute my side for another side, I didn't need a ridiculous rant. Plus, they switched to this new system where they call off your name over the mic, however, the poor quality mic isn't clear. You never know if they're calling your name because all you hear is a muffled voice yelling. Never coming back here again. They definitely had better service during the Fall."}
{"text":"I love the variety of healthy options, the loose leaf teas, and pastries. Great spot for vegetarians or vegans."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast restaurant in Madison!  LOVE LOVE LOVE the spicy tofu scramble and order black beans with it for a protein-packed breakfast!  Topped off with their coffee- been feeling GREAT all day today!  Also- celebrity viewing today at Sunroom.  Star of the UW Badgers Basketball team, Sam Dekker, dining with his friends and team mate Showalter."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the location and the variety of options, including healthy breakfast items. Our waitress was average but the people watching from the window and the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Tried Sunroom for lunch with colleagues...the place was packed and buzzing.  Affordable prices for lunch dishes--salads, sandwiches, burgers, quiche, are some of the menu offerings.  I had the special--pesto burger with potatos.  Tasteful if messy burger, potatos were really just quartered wedges--would opt for the tabouli salad next time.  Enjoyable atmosphere, decent food and good prices...salads and sandwiches are on my list next time I go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to this café for almost eight years, and it remains one of my favorite places to eat in Madison. It was my study-spot of choice during the summer session, mostly because of it's quiet and laid-back vibe. Other State Street cafés fill up quickly, but the Sunroom always had ample table space and a minimal noise level. It's also bright and inviting compared to the windowless-pits-of-intellectualism many students frequent. 

Their muffins and scones are great (the bran muffin - no raisins, very important - was my favorite) as are their smoothies and coffee. Their café Cubanos (espresso with about 10 tablespoons of turbinado sugar) fueled many a cram session. My mom loves their whole wheat pancakes, and their home fries are a yes. Definitely one of the best breakfast/brunch places on State Street."}
{"text":"Love the cakes, tarts and pies. Try the chicken salad sandwich with avocado. Pesto pasta with shrimp used to be a favorite, but the new recipe is just not good. Pizzas are ok. Thai bowl is still decent. Try the mushroom barley soup in winter."}
{"text":"I prefer to go to Sunroom cafe by myself. Its a nice place to just sit by the window and enjoy the view of State street. The food is really really tasty. It gets insaneo busy on the weekends, so if you're going on the weekend or during a football game, be prepared for a crowd of people. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"The all-lowercase menu and self-billing as a \"European-style café\" represent an obvious attempt to gull the college crowd into thinking that this is fine dining. It isn't.

The breakfasts are okay, and reasonably priced, but there are better options in Madison. Avoid for anything else unless you like long waits for tables without the promise of good food at the end."}
{"text":"I came here at least four times, so I don't think it's a one-time-deal.
The food here is VERY BLAND.
Maybe it is because of the organic-ness of the ingredients, but I do not like this place.

It is a nice place to meet up with people who live on campus and such.
But I will rather go to other places on State."}
{"text":"This place is the American Gothic of breakfast food and decor, purposefully bland.

If I were to take a guess, this place gets most of its high ratings because of it's proximity to campus/greek row. A quaint place for sorority girls to quell their hangovers with tasteless food while telling stories about last night."}
{"text":"This is a small yet cozy cafe that serve up very good warm drinks on a cold day.You order at the counter to a friendly and helpful staff member.The food arrives within 10 minutes and it is  flavorful and defiantly delicious! Rate:4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sunroom cafe gives high quality and generous portions of food, all at a reasonable price.  I came here at 7pm and it wasn't too full, so the server got to us right away.  The service is great, our server checked in on us enough times to make us more than content.  I ordered a shrimp quesadilla that was stuffed with  delicious vegetables and juicy shrimp (they certainly did not skimp on the filling).  It also came with rice, beans, guacamole and salsa, all tasting delicious and fresh.  The entrees came with soups, so I ordered the vegetarian chili which was quite flavorful.  Overall, great place to eat if you're looking for good quality and decent prices."}
{"text":"The guy Bruce who manages this place needs a class in how to run a business and some serious customer service training.

They tried to up the price on a take out order, cancelled a catering order at the last minute and left us hanging.

We found them to be rude and not dependable. We will never deal with this place again.

Sad thing about this is the food is average at best.

Strongly recommend you go elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"The Sunroom Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat lunch. I love their soups more than anything else, especially the vegetable lentil. So good! The prices are reasonable, but the seating is limited during the day -- so try to get in just after the lunch rush if you can. 

Their bakery items are always a big hit for me, too. Their bran muffins are hard to beat! And the hummus plate is always a safe bet."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome location and view, but the food needs major improvement. The omelette and homefries I had were way underseasoned and overcooked. The food here is cheap and quick to come out to the table, but there are better breakfast places out there.

For a quick breakfast venue, I'd have to give this place 3/5 stars. I know that this place caters to many undergraduates, but they don't have to sacrifice on quality and taste just to be attractive to poor undergraduates."}
{"text":"I had the Peanut Thai noodles (which I didn't expect much from since this is not a Thai place) and they were amazing!
The dish was beautiful and full of veggies, the server was very nice and I love the decorations. 
I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"i was expecting a lot better.

i had always heard that sunroom was an excellent breakfast place and i'd always wanted to go so when my friend suggested we go this weekend, i jumped at the chance.

we went early (if 10AM is early to you..) so we avoided the apparent lines that come later on the weekend days.  our service was okay.  nothing special -- not good, but not bad either.  my omelet was sub-par though.  not enough cheese and overcooked.  the breakfast potatoes was scarce and also overdone and burnt.  the toast was okay and served with a jam that reminded us all of jello.  

the friend that took me there swears by the place though and apparently his food today was as delicious as it always is.  .. but both me and my other friend didn't really enjoy our meals. 

i guess the prices are decent so that gets a thumbs up. .. but i don't know that i'd go back if given a choice."}
{"text":"Crowded on game days and takes time to get served but worth the wait. Omelettes are second to none."}
{"text":"I love the Sunroom Cafe for brunch. Sundays are the only day they serve the tables, so you order at the counter on other days you want to go here. It's a quaint little spot above State that is very chill. Their roasted potatoes are signature. Breakfast is my favorite meal so I always want to sampler of everything, a pancake or french toast, an egg and some time of bacon or sausage, and breakfast potatoes (pretty hardy huh), so sometimes I'll build my own breakfast from the sides section of the menu, but my absolute favorite on the menu is the Mexican omelette. It's a very savory option. Cheesy, yet fresh with the salsa, with a side of guac, toast, and their potatoes. It's hard to finish because it's good but very delicious. I'll try to explore more of the menu but the Mexican omelette will be a hard one to pass up."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cozy breakfast spots in Madison. It's super close to the campus of University of Wisconsin-Madison, located in the second floor of a building. The restaurant is enjoyed by locals and service is very prompt and delightful. I've been here a few times while traveling to UW-M for conferences or doing research at the Film/Theater Archive, and this convenient location has never disappointed me. They are a solid breakfast choice any day in this fun, trendy city."}
{"text":"Yum! Fresh food with strong vegetarian menu. Best turkey-bacon BLT's & quiche is always good. It's on the 2nd floor with just an awning so we had passed it over many times before stopping in. Feels like a little bit of Portland in the Midwest."}
{"text":"I would give this place an easy 4 stars if their potatoes were any good on a consistent basis. The last time I went there, they happened to be well-cooked, but most of the time they're really dried out, like they've been sitting around for a while. The same is true at their sister restaurant, Sunprint Cafe, by the capitol.

Ask for the couscous side instead. Lots of fresh tomatoes and parsley!"}
{"text":"Low-key and friendly mimosa-and-quiche kind of breakfast."}
{"text":"The best of Madison!! I have been here 20+ times over the years, both as a student and an \"adult\".  The good is amazing for breakfast lovers and health food nuts.  They do what Madison does best, be healthy without making a big deal of it.  They also have a tasteful selection of alcohol and alcoholic coffees for those who can't do brunch without it.  Seating is first come first serve; however, somehow the flow of traffic usually works perfectly with the number of seats available.  Sunroom well always be my favorite place for breakfast in Madison.  And, as long as they have the Mexican Omelette, I will be ordering it!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Burnt omlette. Burnt toast. Green mold on one of the (heel) toast pieces for my daughter. Potatoes so overcooked they were like dehydrated plastic and had an odd aftertaste (probably burnt or old oil). Here is an idea Sunroom: maybe don't leave the potatoes in the oven ALL day, and then try to serve them. The cooks here during this shift are either hung over, or don't like cooking: either way they are just throwing food down on a plate. 

Cashier offered to remake order, but when there is mold on the bread, the potatoes are from a large burnt batch, and the cooks can't cook an egg what is the point? We headed down to Caribou for bfast sandwiches. Management, you might want to visit once in a while. We'll check back in a year. Good bye for now Sunroom."}
{"text":"Breakfast at the sunroom.  Ordered omelette a: florentine and the tomato basil with goat cheese ( usually available on Sunday's only).   Order from the counter and they only feature self serve option.  Coffee was just okay and any refills cost additional $$'s.  In addition to virtually no actual 'service' we wee treated like outsiders (even asked if we were tourists) despite being frequent visitors to Madison ( like weekly) and several visits to sunroom. Overall the weekday service and visit to sunroom was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Cute little place on the 2nd floor off of State Street.  Look for the awning because otherwise the place is easy to miss.  The food was good but not great.  Again, Madison excels in breakfast so its hard to compete."}
{"text":"Super casual upstairs lunch joint on State Street.  They have a great tuna salad sandwich on a french baguette with pasta salad and their breakfast is very good too."}
{"text":"I've never understood the hype about this place. I've eaten here a couple times  simply because of the location and I keep thinking I'll be impressed but I never have. It's not bad. I would just much rather eat somewhere else. The omelettes that I've gotten have all tasted slightly artificial and the fruit is never fresh (I understand it's in Wisconsin, but comparatively to other fruit I've gotten here it does). Also, the service here tends to be on the rude side.  The only time I would possibly suggest coming here is when you're looking to study/hangout because the sunshine atmosphere (on a good day!) is nice."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast.  Food was good and fresh. More like cafeteria style but don't let that stop you.  A little hard to find as it is on the second floor of the building. Make sure you look for the sign."}
{"text":"A hostess that doesn't take names if there is a wait and seems to seat people that just walk up before people that had been waiting. LOW quality food(my Denver omelette didn't have any cheese in it??!!??!! Isn't that illegal in Wisconsin??!!?) and mediocre table service. When I asked about no cheese, the server gave me an excuse of people in the kitchen taking vacations and said the cook forgot to put it in there. She gave me a lemon scone to make up for it. I don't want a lemon scone, I want cheese in my omelets. She didn't offer to fix it. Even if she did offer to take it back, I didn't want to wait another 35 minutes to get it back. I wish there was a way to rate lower than one star."}
{"text":"This little cafe is marked by a yellow and black striped awning (like a bumblebee). Once you ascend the stairs, we had no trouble finding a round, corner table with plenty of space.  I thought they had a particularly yummy ham and American cheese grilled sandwich with healthy wheat bread. The potatoes were offset nicely with some spice on their skins."}
{"text":"1) Really, really fresh food. Tasty too.
2) Great ambiance. Doesn't even feel like you're on State Street.

Now the con - REALLY rude lady consistently at the front. I don't know if she's the owner, but her attitude with me on all occasions that I've been there (more than a dozen) lost the place 2 stars in my eyes. Extremely curt, unfriendly, tossing my change back at me, and rolling her eyes and sighing when I make a request for some mayo on my veggie burger (seriously?). It's like I forget about her every time I decide to go there, and am a little pissed, although my appetite is satisfied, when I'm done. Has anyone else had similar experiences?"}
{"text":"How many fond memories I have of this gem. :) and of the Sunprint days as well. The food here is fine, probably 3 stars overall, with the baked goods scoring a little better. But the sun bun deserves like 837372 stars all on its own. So, 4 stars."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday morning.  Sunlight peeked in the windows, it wasn't crowded with people, and it was pleasant.  I had a pumpkin chocolate chip muffin.  It doesn't look big, but it is filling.  I could only finish half of it with my coffee.  The coffee is standard.  Both were $1.50 each.

My friend had their Mexican omelet.  I had a few bites and it was tasty, maybe the salsa/guacamole was overpowering the egg-y-ness of the omelet.  Also, they should have used chorizo rather than regular American breakfast links.  The flavors did not match up.  With the omelet came potatoe quarters that were dry, and bread that was already light buttered.  I liked that the bread was easy to eat."}
{"text":"Another perfect lunch here today!

Wanted to get on Yelp again to give a special shout-out to our wonderful waitress, Allie (\"Ally\"? \"Ali\"?)"}
{"text":"Thai Noodle Bowl is awesome!  I didn't expect it, but it had so many yummy veggies perfectly cooked in a fabulous creamy peanut sauce.  My new favorite dish.  The atmosphere is quite cozy, too.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Well this was not what I expected. In the hallway and stairs, you are thinking OMG I am not eating here... Even in the actual restaurant, I had some doubts, but the food was amazing!!! Blueberry pancakes were great and the coffee wasn't half bad. The wait staff seem a little put off by the fact that you are there, but \"effe em\" I liked the food anyways."}
{"text":"They could probably use a little more variety in their menu; then again, I always want their nommy pancakes anyway. I would say breakfast is their specialty. Either way, Sunroom is one of my favorite places in Madison. Despite being busy at times, I love the atmosphere. I am pretty much always down for Sunroom."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at the Sunroom Cafe this past Friday. We had tried going a couple of times previously and there was always a long wait, so we were excited to actually get in.

The restaurant is on the 2nd floor at the top of a set of stairs. The stairway up could definitely use some freshening up -- new paint, some cleaning. But once you enter the Cafe everything was clean and quaint. Great pictures of the American Flag adorn the walls.

We ordered at the counter where the menu was written on a chalkboard. The menu consisted primarily of omelette dishes and included a wrap, a sandwich and pancake options. I opted for the breakfast wrap which was described as scrambled eggs with ham, pepper, onion, cheese and a side of roasted potatoes. 

When your meal is ready, they call out your name and you go pick up your dishes at the counter. There are no napkins other than the one they give you with your meal. I found this off-putting.  I'm getting my own fork, water, hot-sauce etc. Why not the napkins? It feels strange to have to ask for an additional napkin - am I imposing somehow?

The wrap was 90% scrambled eggs. It did come with a ramekin of tasty salsa but otherwise was very bland. The roasted potatoes were similarly bland. Luckily there is salt and pepper at each table. 

What I did like about the place were the prices which were quite reasonable. However, as I was highly disappointed in the food, I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"After one (million) too many beers the night before, all I was craving in the whole world was an omelette. A big ol' cheesy omelette. My husband and I spotted some tasty looking ones on the menu at the Orpheum, but much to my chagrin, they were closing for a wedding.

We sauntered down State Street reading menus until we hit the jackpot with Sunroom Cafe. I had been here probably close to a decade earlier and honestly, the only thing I remembered was that we had to go upstairs.

I ordered my omelette (Spinach, feta, mushrooms) and my husband ordered the huevos rancheros. He was aghast when it came out with 2 sunny side up eggs on top of something that looked like chili on top of some white tortillas. Unfortunately, it did state on the menu that the eggs were sunny side up (but my husband assumed they were scrambled, as he normally orders them). He had about one bite and called it quits.

My omelette was decent, my potatoes were nicely seasoned, I could tell they took a lot of care with their food. The toast, could've been a little higher quality to go with the rest of the vibe, but I wasn't really in it for the toast."}
{"text":"Everything on this menu is basically cooked in a very fresh, healthy way.  I loved their original handmade salad dressing.  A favorite of mine is the chicken salad and fruit plate.  It comes with pita bread and was just lovely.  Sunroom Cafe offers a variety of tea that is freshly brewed in your own teapot.  I am a tea-drinker and you get a very satisfying two or three cups from the pot.  Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner Sunroom Cafe is named accordling as it iis a great, cozy place to dine."}
{"text":"This place has GREAT vegetarian food, as far as non-ethnic vegetarian food goes. I remember quite distinctly their tofu sandwich, which was one of THE best sandwiches I have ever had, filled with fresh alfalfa sprouts and tomatoes. Beyond that it is fairly good, a nice spot to grab a quick bite. Some of the food IS a tad bland, however adequate seasoning (Siracha) is provided. Friendly staff as well as good food, the Sunroom Cafe is pretty dope."}
{"text":"For a vegan breakfast in Madison, Sunroom is definitely a contender. I've been here a few times and the servers always suggest the tofu scramble and the breakfast burrito vegan-style. They don't have veggie options for substituting one veggie for another so it helps if you like mushrooms, especially if you get the tofu scramble which is packed with them. Most of mine ended up on the side of my plate. Also on the menu is oatmeal with bananas and raisins, fruit cups, and customized fruit smoothies. It might not be the most diverse vegan breakfast menu (don't get your hopes up for pancakes or waffles) but they've got a good start and a staff that knows what's up for vegans.

Besides having some decent vegan options, the Sunroom is currently at the top of my list for vegan breakfast because of the setting and atmosphere. Parking is easy (I park in the North Frances lot) and precedes a short walk on State Street to get to Sunroom. It's a cozy, intimate, diner-style venue upstairs with a nice view of State Street if you grab the right table. Local art is on the wall and there's plenty of Madison publications near the door for you to read while you dine solo if that's your thing. Perfect for a lazy vegan Sunday!!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch!  Have been there several times for omelettes, and have always had a good experience.  The room is a bit small, so it's difficult to find space during peak dining times if you have a bigger group."}
{"text":"A nice little spot near the Memorial library on campus.

Came here today for lunch and had a decent tuna avocado plate with a cup of veggie chilli. The food was filling. It was not great but fairly good. I do really like the atmosphere of the place as, true to it's name, the second floor restaurant gets really nice lighting. I've also had a very pleasant breakfast or two here in the past although it does get a bit crowded on weekends.

I'd also give extra props to a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Madison. The roasted potatoes and spicy tofu scramble are my favorites. And the espresso is good, too!"}
{"text":"The only reason i didnt give a four star rating was due to waitresses who didn't seem to care. 

The food, however, is phenominal.  We went on a sunday for brunch. The fruit-filled pancakes were great. Don't presume small pieces of fruit. These are whole apple slices and bunches of blueberries. To compliment the pancakes were some of the best oven-roasted potatoes this guy has ever tasted. 

Don't expect compassion, just a hearty, healthy meal."}
{"text":"I like it here. The prices aren't too bad and the food is pretty good. It's kind of like a better Denny's? The restaurant is a bit small so sometimes it can feel packed even though there may not be actually a ton of people there, but the decor is home-y and the service is great. I usually will pick Sunroom over other places if I want to get pancakes in the morning. (Side note: I usually get buttermilk pancakes with sunny side up eggs and a side of potatoes which are super good!) If you have trouble climbing stairs, you may have trouble accessing the restaurant as it is located on the second floor and I'm unaware of any handicap accessibility."}
{"text":"I have somehow come to love this place. I remember the first time I went, I walked in and walked out, and I'm definitely glad I went back.  During the weekends it gets pretty crowded but the line moves pretty quickly. If you are coming with small groups of people you will actually jump in front of large chunks of the line. 

They serve pretty good coffee; I really like their cappuccino (second in Madison in my mind only to Graze right now), their omelettes and french toast. I tend to not stray from those items ;) 

I'm not usually in Madison during the weekday but apparently their weekday prices are ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"My favorite State Street area restaurant.  What sets them apart is the great choices for those of us who like fresh foods.  I can go in and choose from several options that feature various breads, salads, cheeses, hummus, etc.  I've been there a dozen times and tried many of the vegetarian menu options, and have yet to be disappointed.

I went yesterday for breakfast, and got the fruit platter with a bran muffin.  The muffin was so tasty it didn't need butter, and the fruit was freshly cut, nicely presented, and very good. For people who richer fare, there are plenty of choices as well.  People at other tables had omelettes and other eggy things that looked and smelled great.  All the baked goods are really good too.

You've got to be ready for a line during a good portion of the day.  The place is popular and you order at the counter, so there's often a back-up at the register.  There's one little spot where you go to order, come back to pick up your food, ask for coffee refills, and get you water, flatwear, etc.  Obviously, this spot gets very crowded.  But once you get out to the main section with the tables, everything is informal and comfy. 

Bottom line is, excellent food in a cafe-type setting, but best to avoid rush hour."}
{"text":"Oh yum!! My husband and I were out and about looking for a solid breakfast place and he pointed this 'hole-in-the wall' nook. The restaurant is located above (approx. 15 stairs up) We were blown away. I had the spicy tofu scramble with roasted 'taters. Heaven on a plate. The spicy, wonderful chunks of firm tofu exploded with flavor, waking my mouth up and creating little sweat dew under my eyes. Aaaa....
Totally would go back."}
{"text":"The spicy tofu scramble is everything you wanted it to be and more. Comes with potatoes and several pieces of toast.

And the view is pretty great, too. Lots of good people watching from up there."}
{"text":"Diner-quality food without the grease. Everything is pretty solid and they're generally not outrageously busy. I think a family still runs the place, so it's pretty cute. Tofu scrambler is my favorite. The sunroom cafe is between Marigold's and Mickey's (Regent St.)."}
{"text":"Vegetarian's heaven
Lunch-order at the counter
Dinner-Wait to be seated
Coming from NY, I forgot how dirt cheap Madison was. Nachos with Guac + a Burger, $12. My friend got the hummus platter on a salad- complained that there was too much hummus and not enough salad- maybe if they served it with bread, it would be better.
Love the seating here, but Sunroon always makes me think, Hey, they've got seating outside.... well they don't."}
{"text":"Sunroom Cafe is probably the cutest way you can start your day. It's got the feel of a cozy California cafe with its menu in chalk featuring some healthy and veggie options as well as a wide range of coffee choices.  Way better chai than Starbucks... the chai latte is delightfully spicy or the chai chiller is a good summer treat.  Even their regular coffee packs the caffeine punch I'm usually looking for.  Tasty pastries, too! I had a scone that was so moist, it could have had an identity crisis.  It gets crowded on the weekends, but the line is usually really short on mid-morning weekdays.

Haven't tried lunch or dinner there yet, but somedayyy..."}
{"text":"Had to wait in a long line, no waiter service, the staff was very rude and made us feel like we were doing something wrong. Once we ordered, we had to listen for our names to be called on a mostly broken speaker. Very hectic and unorganized. Food wasn't good enough to make up for any of that."}
{"text":"The Sunroom is pretty close to Madison's best American style diner. It looks like a hole in the wall and you have to go up a flight of stairs to get to it, but Sunroom's dining room is surprisingly charming, albeit without a view of the sun. 

The menu is vast and they serve breakfast through 2:00pm. I've only tried their breakfast, but their omelettes, coffee and breakfast potatoes are among the best I've come across. Prices are reasonable and the food is non-greasy. I've heard good things about their pastries and smoothies. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sunroom Cafe is a cheerful spot that offers a very extensive menu of both healthy (tofu/guac burrito and nutty oatmeal) and your standard breakfast items.  They offer a full beverage selection and their lattes are delightful.

The eclectic crowd is always fighting for a seat near the window....so be ready to wait it out or settle for another spot (the window is best, but any seat will do when the food is good).  

The best part of Sunroom is that it is one of the few distinctive breakfast places on state that isnt a chain and offers substantial breakfast/brunch/lunch options."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast sandwich - I got mine on a bagel.  They are very generous with their egg servings!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid cafe with solid food. I've had the lox omelet and the toasted veggie sandwich here and they were both delicious and large portions. I also appreciate a place that has a selection of hot sauce. It's a no frills kind of place and they focus on the food. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food is fine, all the employees are extremely and uncomfortably rude. The service is slow, and it's very overpriced."}
{"text":"We walked 10 minutes in the rain to get here on our last morning in Madison and it was well worth it!  This would indeed be a nice view of State Street had it been a sunny day.  It is a charming restaurant with an earthy, relaxing vibe.  I loved my banana wheat pancakes and almond mocha and the hubby's French toast was awesome.  The scrambled eggs were overdone and quite flavorless.  The breakfast potatoes were well seasoned, but again, overdone.  Service was fast.  Overall, Sunroom Cafe really hit the spot on a dreary morning.  With a few tweaks, this place could be awesome."}
{"text":"For some unknown reason, I had a terrible experience with getting a vanilla chai in Madison.  Sunroom Cafe did not help matters at all.  I ordered an iced vanilla chai latte, but the vanilla flavoring must have been off--the taste reminded me of cough syrup.    

I had the tofu breakfast burrito, which came with some delicious potatoes.  The guacamole on my burrito was really good, but the salsa was forgettable.  However, I was particularly dismayed that there were mushrooms in my burrito.  Mushrooms weren't mentioned on the menu, and I really despise mushrooms.  My mushroom hatred is even mentioned in my Yelp profile.  So I wound up dissecting the burrito and picking out the fillings that I liked.  I'd have asked for no mushrooms if I'd been warned about them.  Other than the unwanted surprise mushrooms, the burrito was pretty good."}
{"text":"What a unique place! I definitely had the best sandwich EVER here -- The Muffaletta. Olive tapenade, roasted red peppers, mozarella, and tomatoes. YUM! The people there were friendly and it had a quaint and cozy atmosphere. Vegetarian and vegan options, and some really good looking pies and cookies! We were there on a Monday afternoon, and it was packed - obviously a popular joint."}
{"text":"Usually love going to this place for breakfast, but they changed how you get served (by seating you at a table now instead of going to the counter to order and then be sat) and we were treated poorly by the host. We walked up to the counter and the host said \"are you sitting down to eat\" and we said yes. He goes \"well the sign says here to be wait to be seated\". We thought he was super rude to us and very unfriendly for a host. Potato's were good and I got the Florentine omelet which was pretty good. Never have had an issue with the food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  The service was great, but I went there at an off hour.  I had a big salad with hummus, which was excellent.  I definitely plan to go back."}
{"text":"The menu is super cheap and has halfway decent options. However, they were somewhat lacking in meat options. The restaurant is also quite small, which can lead to a very long wait during sunday brunches."}
{"text":"pretty damn cute, for a college cafe.

the best: sunlight, izze, the sweet guy who works there (owns it?), hungover discussions of ohmygodyouknowwhosarahhookedupwithlastnight?!

the worst: hungover discussions of ohmygodyouknowwhosarahhookedupwithlastnight?!"}
{"text":"The single best place to go for breakfast on State Street.

Their basic eggs and roasted potatoes dish is cheap, filling, and fast. Breakfast burritos are the exemplar of white-bread preparation but are filling and good. Quiche are of decent size and worth grabbing. They have a large loose-leaf tea selection. Quality scones at the counter for those on the run.

Lunch ranges from OK to good. Tofu scramblers and a no-meat muffaleta are nice options for vegetarians afraid to eat all the rest of the vegetarian food across the street at Buraka, Kabul, Husnus, or Med Cafe.  Fish specials offer a nice medium portion for very affordable price; recommended served on a healthy if-mostly-iceberg-lettuce salad. 

The seating area is sunny and spacious and tables constantly open up even when it's busy. It's also a good place for people watching."}
{"text":"What a super warm and happy place! I love the location and the sunny feeling. The food is good, I had the Mexican omelette and I enjoyed it. I would say that it was fairly okay though--I wouldn't go back specifically for the food, but I would go back for the sunshine!!"}
{"text":"I chose a honey dijon dressing for my house salad. Eh....didn't finish it. It tasted like I was eating salad with straight up mustard. No thanks. 

The beef quesadillas lacked a bit more seasoning, but the spice was there. It came with black beans, rice, and guacamole. Mix it all together and it's nothing too extraordinary. Pretty plain and simple. 

The grilled chicken sandwich was plain as well. My fiance used ketchup to add some flavor to it, plus it was a pretty dry sandwich. Not even mayonnaise? His mashed potatoes were plain too. Lacked seasoning and no gravy.

Notice a theme? Plain. Not seasoned well. Average customer service.Mediocre food, but at least we were with good company. 

Maybe it was an off night?"}
{"text":"What drives me here...location.  Their breakfast is ok however their dinner options are way better.  What I dislike most about the place is that you have to get up and pick up your meal at the front counter (typical during breakfast and possibly lunch times).  On weekends there is a huge bottleneck when ordering...."}
{"text":"I have only eaten take out from here and did not pick it up myself, but my friend who did told me it was a really interesting place right off of state that is worth checking out (and he is a highly trustworthy person with these types of things!).

I sampled the following (as to go preparations) and I was impressed and would try again:
Breakfast Burrito
Huevos Rancheros
Breakfast Wrap
Wheat Pancakes
Chocolate Chip Pancakes
Blueberry Pancakes (preferred over chocolate chip and regular)"}
{"text":"The cashier lady was kind of racist. She thought the other Asian person behind me was with me and did not take her name for the order. The last two times I was there, she was very impatient and and annoyed with me for some inexplicable reasons but was all smiley with the other customers. I could almost sense the hostility and discomfort. I was not a rude person or anything and was fine at other places. 
This happened a month ago. Needless to say, I never returned and I hope those who care about equality to take issues with this experience as well."}
{"text":"I end up going here when a bunch of people band together for lunch and someone invariably says (without much enthusiasm), \"I guess we could go to Sunroom.\" Then we all sigh and sulk upstairs. Every time I hope that something will surprise me, but every time I leave with the same impression. The menu looks like a halfway decent home cook thought he'd start a restaurant and serve the ten things he makes for himself on a Tuesday night or late Sunday morning. Breakfast burrito? Sandwich? Hummus platter? Chili? Nothing that even attempts to raise eyebrows. Beyond that, the preparation, service, and dining room are all rather lackluster. And you're pressed up against a table full of either undergraduate students, grad students, or professors, with no music to drown out their conversations and allow you to have a private conversation of your own. Chipotle is more appealing at this rate (and not much different price-wise). Or just make a sandwich at home, for Pete's sake! I might rate eating a homemade sandwich alone at my desk higher than Sunroom."}
{"text":"The Cafe occupies a small room on the second floor on State St.  The walls are covered with art from locals just beginning their careers.  Dining is very informal, you order, then sit down and wait.  When your order is ready, they call your name and you go to the counter and retrieve it.

The bakery items are very good, the coffee is bad.  The food however, is very good for the price.  Its simple food, but tastes great.  I like it because its the kind of food I could make myself, but rarely have time or energy to do so.  Daily specials are especially cheap, about six bucks for an entrée and a small side.  They have a great selection of vegan/vegetarian selections as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very good food. If your on state street give them a try. You will enjoy."}
{"text":"after a hellish weekend of mosquito bites and rain, my friends and i took a stop at the sunroom cafe, and it really shed some light onto our trip. this homeless man recommended the sunroom cafe to us, and he really knew what he was talking about! the prices are around 5-7 dollars a pop.

one thing you will need to be prepared for is that it's a pseudo-sit down restaurant. hiking and camping for a few days was a pretty rigorous thing, especially in the flood-like conditions we experienced, and i was not prepared to lift a foot when i was there. getting up and down and up and down to refill my coffee (which you had to pay for) and to get my omelet was not the most fun thing for my glutes or quads. 

OTHER than that, the food was exactly what the doctor ordered for my tired, broken down body. it was also cool to see the vibe of the place. lots of professors sitting around reading a book by themselves. i loved checking out the local newspapers they had lying around there."}
{"text":"Ate here on a weekend for dinner with some friends and was kind of disappointed. I heard that this is a decent place to go for breakfast/lunch, but the restaurant seemed really confused as to what it was during dinner service. When we walked in, it was pretty dead during prime dinner hours. The atmosphere was odd. It was cross between fancy sit down and pay at the counter cafe. 

The menu was interesting and had a variety of food choices but nothing in particular really stood out to me. Our waitress was very helpful and suggested several of the menu items for us. I wasn't too crazy about the fact that the starch option for the dinner was mashed potatoes. It was kind of odd since we all had ordered sandwiches. However, the sandwiches themselves were great! I had a steak sandwich and it tasted awesome.

Prices were reasonable. I would give this place another go, but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of the only decent places in Madison to get a really good bagel and lox platter.  They make an awesome smoothie and an even awesomer hot cocoa.  It's a place to go for breakfast or lunch after class or when you bring your parents into town, as it's pretty much one of the only sit-down breakfast places on state street.  Cozy and on the 2nd floor, you feel kind of removed from the bustle.  It's nice!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a lower score of three stars, even though I come here all the time for lunch or bfast.  What I like about Sunroom:  Great location by campus and downtown, it's literally sunny, a variety of food options, a few good dishes at affordable (but not dirt-cheap) prices, quick and friendly service.  What I don't like about Sunroom:  Their stale and overcooked potatoes that come with a lot of the meals (seriously, the worst I've ever had on a consistent basis), sometimes their bread is also stale (as in, hard-as-a-rock), and the unimaginative decor.  Gets busy during weekday lunch hour, but you still don't have to wait forever for your meal or a table somehow.  Seems perfectly equipped for the university-related crowd."}
{"text":"I didn't sit in to eat because it was so packed but I did order a couple things to go. Note that it was probably packed to the rim because this place is just that darn good. I saw people flocking to any groups that seemed to be leaving just to get a table.

I ordered a baked veggie bread. It had tomato, peppers and other veggies I can't recall too much. But it was amazing! I ordered two of these because they looked so delicious from the window. And delicious they looked, delicious they were. Very cheap too.

I also had a chocolate-chip wheat pancake. You can't go wrong with pancakes but this one was delicious. I ate it along with a Chai latte from Starbucks across the street, inducing me in a double sugar coma.

I wish I could've had time to eat brunch here but I'm sure I'd have to go super early given how busy the place was. That is how I prefer it though... I wouldn't want to go somewhere that was empty. Most usually for me, Empty = bad food. But I give the Sunroom Cafe a two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite. The service was extremely sassy. Customer service is definitely not a forte of this restaurant. You walk upstairs and it's on the second floor. The counter area is a little crowded and of the two employees, only one really knew what was up. There were only two flavors of bagel: onion and sesame. I had the bagel sandwich with egg and cheese on sesame. It was pretty standard but not too hot. The breakfast potatoes were pretty good and well seasoned. I thought it was overall a little overpriced, but for a college student it's a fine choice."}
{"text":"In the heart of Madison and UW, this place is easily passed up as it is a bit hard to spot.  Have to go up stairs and the dining area is not too big.  

Ate here for breakfast and the food did not disappoint.  The pancakes are thick and can have apple, banana, or chocolate chimes in them.  Menu is simple but offers a bit for everyone.  

Great spot for breakfast!  Definitely caters to the college crowd."}
{"text":"I've heard that sometimes Yelp can be wrong.....and in this case, it was. I believed the 4 .5 stars when we chose, but Sunroom failed to live up to its given rating!

The upstairs restaurant looks over the main pedestrian stroll, downtown Madison. 

I tried the quiche of the day and my lover had the breakfast burrito. The quiche was almonds and broccoli. The burrito was sausage and potatoes. Both were mild in taste. Nothing standout. Just plain.

Bland is the best way to describe it.

The coffee station was inconvenient. Right by the register, just in the way and intrusive, if someone else is ordering. 

Also, I dont' like to order, sit, stand, carry my own food, sit down, get up to make coffee, bump into people, sit, then eat. 

Not cool. Especially if each plate is 7 or 8 dollars and you aren't even served.  

Skip. Go to a diner."}
{"text":"I walked by this place a few times before I ever knew it was there. At the base of State Street, near the campus, you'll find this place located upstairs above another business. It is named the Sunroom for an obvious reason. The large windows offer lots of sunshine, especially on Sunday mornings for brunch.

They offer vegetarian items, which I appreciate. This is the second best place in Madison for brunch."}
{"text":"Hands down this is a GREAT place to eat! My favorite meals are the french toast and the BLT with avocado! There are a lot of options, something for everyone to enjoy! The price is reasonable as well and the atmosphere is cozy. 

The only reason I did not give more than three stars is the customer service. The cashier is always either this man and or his wife. For whatever reason they are so RUDE. Last time I was there with some friends the woman actually threw my credit card at me once she was done with it. It was the first time my friends had been there and the were SHOCKED at how awful the service was - but they did enjoy the food! I guess it is just strange that such as happy place is run by crabby people! 

Regardless I will continue to eat there for the food but I know not to expect good service."}
{"text":"Sunroom is a lovely place to meet for breakfast, lunch, and even dinner! They have good food- never anything too sophisticated, but always good! Get a window seat for a sweet view of State Street. Their pastries are always delish, the chai chiller is bomb, and any egg dish with avocado is a pleaser. Try it!"}
{"text":"Great location for those wanting to walk around State Street near the University. 

We went here for Sunday brunch. Friendly staff and a cozy upstairs dining room. The pancakes were nothing to write home about but the roasted potatoes and omelets were tasty.

I wish I had tried a pastry! I didn't realize they even had pastries until
I went up to the counter to pay. I'd recommend this place for breakfast/brunch if you are in that part of town."}
{"text":"Summary: I would highly recommend Sun Room Cafe for breakfast or lunch, but not dinner. Fantastic when good, but slightly inconsistent, the Sun Room Cafe could make a few improvements to boost it to the level of truly stellar cafe. 

I've been the to sunroom multiple times and I will probably continue to come back as long as I live here in Madison. It's an excellent little space located on the second floor of a building along State street. The inside is fairly well decorated, with the standard art culled from local artists. It may not be unique (i.e slightly cliche) but It is arranged tastefully along the walls and isn't overly distracting. The best places to sit are along the windowed wall overlooking state street. Right now, it's so beautiful outside that it's nice to have a good amount of light and see people walking outside.

One of the Sun Room's few flaws is it has a case of multiple personality syndrome. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and Sunday brunch at the restaurant are very different experiences. 

At breakfast and lunch, the place feels like a small cafe, with it's counter ordering and self selection of seats. The food is generally the best during these two periods. My experience is with the Turkey Mozzarella sandwich, the Turkey burger, and the daily soups. The Turkey Mozzarella sandwich has been good, but also suffers from the inconsistent results. Most of the time, the sandwich is an excellent blend of sliced turkey and mozzarella placed on a nice hard sandwich roll. However, I have gotten it before when it was just terrible. The turkey that time was just sliced and a giant chunk of mozzarella stuck in the middle. The rolls can at times seem a little stale, but I haven't had that as a major problem in the past. The Turkey burger has always been a consistent hit for me: good price and not overly greasy. 

All of their sandwiches come with home-fries. I actually disagree with Gina S's review that says they they are consistently stale or overcooked. One of the major problems with most cafe's that serve home-fries is that they are always raw in the middle. I really appreciate that they are fully cooked and slightly crispy on the outside. I do, however, think that one of their chefs is the result of the inconsistency. I don't know if s/he works on only certain days, but the days in which I have received poor sandwich results are the same days that the home-fries have clearly been left in a pan pre-cooked for too long. Overall, I like the potatoes. They are a far superior side to their tabouli, which is far far too acidic. The one time I had it, it tasted like an entire lemon had been squeezed on my plate. 

The soups are one of the highlights of lunch in my opinion. The vegetarian chili is just superb. I actually wish that I could just get a small cup of soup in place of my sides. That would be a major improvement in my opinion. They always have a vegan soup, and usually a non-veggie soup as well. The Tuscan white bean soup I had last week was just fantastic. Probably because of the nature of soup, it doesn't seem to have the same inconsistency as some of the other parts of the restaurant.

Breakfast is similarly great. The omelets that i've had have been really nice, not overcooked and fluffy. The wheat pancakes are a definite treat that I can't resist whenever I happen to be here for breakfast. The Sunday brunch however is far too busy for the tiny cafe, and often the line stretches down the stairs to get in. 

Dinner, however, is like walking into a completely different restaurant. Suddenly, you have to wait to be seated. You have a waiter/ess who slightly inattentively watches over you. The menu at dinner is really just a more expensive version of the lunch menu, but with added \"entrees\" like fish, pastas, and quesadillas. Honestly, I think that they should just scrap the dinner menu and add the most popular pastas to the lunch menu and serve that all day. 

Overall, the improvements I would make are to add internet access, at least for the off hours, there is no one in the cafe from 2 to 5, and I would love to sit here and drink some of their tea and work, but little power plugins and no internet are obviously a deterrent. It's clear that they don't have these because they are trying to prevent people from sitting around in the peak hours, but I would encourage them to add them in order to boost off hour or night business. After all, I would much rather come here than other cafes/coffee shops in the area because of the superior variety of baked goods here. Work on consistency (fire whoever the off-day cook is) and simplifying the dinner menu, and this would be one of the best places in town."}
{"text":"Super awesome breakfast food, their potatoes are amazing. My only grievance is they credit card swiper machine is a hassle to use and figure out. Overall though, I always recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice location, cool view from the second floor.  Very simple, great for a sunday morning brunch.  Food is what you expect."}
{"text":"This place was recommended at the front desk at the Best Western Hotel. It was ok. Not good for the elderly because  you have walk a long flight of stairs. It is a self service restaurant. For the price I could have eaten at Bob Evan cheaper, been waited on and had a better more satifying breakfast. Even Denny's is better than this which is not saying much.I would not say it is cheap. It is average. The blueberry scones were delicious and they do bake it there. So if I were to go back again for some odd reason I would get the scones and coffee.  College students like it. I guess it is perfect for them."}
{"text":"Good solid all day breakfast food at a very reasonable price. Has a cosy, \"Grandma's kitchen\" kinda feel to it and is well named as the extensive windows catch the sun well.

The food is not spectacular but is always tasty and hearty and I would recommend most things on their menu. Definitely worth a visit if you have some time to spend in Madison!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast in Madison. I went here a handful of times and the menu was great. They also have your basic breakfast cocktails. Definitely recommend it for a no-frills brunch."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but each were too long ago for me to remember any details other than I was pleased and happy with each dish. I went this morning with a friend though, and it was terrific.

I got one of the best smoothies I've ever had in my life from here (strawberry and banana with orange juice). Very creamy and smooth--none of the chunky icy texture either. The portions are small, but it's so good.

I also got a buttermilk pancake and it was a pretty good pancake! Nothing phenomenal there, but it really hit the spot.

I've never been disappointed with Sunroom, so if you're into healthier, good food at pretty cheap prices--well worth your time to examine and try out."}
{"text":"Chocolate chip pancakes are amazing! Cute little place right off state street with incredibly long lines on the weekends. Service was fast and a lot of different items on the menu. Very good prices for what you get!"}
{"text":"On previous trips, I'd found Sunroom to be only okay - the food always sounded and looked good, but it was inevitably bland. I hadn't been there for at least four years, but gave it another go last night with a friend visiting from DC who wanted a good salad and had fond memories of Sunroom visits past.

I'm glad I gave it another chance. I was pretty hungry, so I wanted something hearty. I went for the veggie burger with salsa and guacamole. It was delicious from top to bottom. The bun was fresh and chewy, the lettuce and tomato crisp and colorful, the salsa and guac seemed to have been made fresh on site, and the patty was -- different. But good. Closer to falafel than a traditional soy burger, it had almost a creamy consistency. On paper it sounds gross, but it worked  with the soft bun and toppings. I love condiments, so I also threw on some mustard, which turned out to be an amazing pairing - it was spicy and a little vinegary and added an extra kick to the guacamole and salsa. 

The burger was served with mashed potatoes, and despite coming plain and dry (no garlic, gravy, or otherwise), they were full of flavor. 

My dinner companions also enjoyed their dishes (mussels appetizer, Thai peanut noodle bowl, and Thai tofu salad). An added bonus was our lovely waitress. I plan to put Sunroom back on my radar, especially for breakfast - I hear it's amazing."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE in town! Second time here and the staff was so rude that we had to leave. 
We asked for the breakfast menu, and the guy at the counter told us the special was on an iPad placed on the side. So we browsed through the pictures on it, and then a young lady came out from the kitchen. She frowned, stared at us and asked us why we are touching the iPad. She then angrily grabbed the iPad and brought it back with her like we were trying to break it or steal it. 
No one told us the displayed picture was the only special - that's why we were browsing the iPad. And we did nothing more than scrolling up and down. I don't know why she was so angry at us. 
Upon reading other reviews, I saw that this young lady is consistently being rude to customers. How can the owner do nothing with her and the overall customer service?! Don't go to this place unless you are prepared for the rude staff ruining your day."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food. Loved the quiches for breakfast.  Quiet and good for reading while sipping tea."}
{"text":"The Sunroom Cafe has a lovely location but very little else going for it.

Breakfast is, I suppose, edible, but it's hardly good.  I've gotten used to a simple question when I order breakfast: \"white, wheat, or rye?\"  You won't get that here because they only have wheat bread.  I don't care for wheat bread.  Their sausages are pretty nasty too-- little shriveled overspiced things (which is funny, because everything else is horribly bland).  I don't mind counter service, but if I'm the ONLY person in the restaurant, do you think you could bring me my plate rather than calling for me to come over and get it?

I wouldn't touch this place for lunch or dinner with a ten-foot pole.  On the two or three times I've been there everything has been beyond disgusting.  I don't know why people like this place so much."}
{"text":"Great potatoes and omelettes, one of my favorite places to get breakfast or brunch on State Street!  Not to mention the pastries are great!  Service might take time depending on how busy it is."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos aren't easy to come by for the lowly vegan. That's why I was PUUUUUMPPPED to find that Sunroom serves up a pretty good tofu burrito for a reasonable $6.95. The burrito comes with tofu, black beans, (and optional cheese) wrapped in a flour tortilla and topped with salsa and guacamole. It comes with a side of roasted potatoes, which are pretty dry, but decent slathered in Tabasco or ketchup. The whole ordeal can get kinda liquidy, but tasty and a good option for the veg-heads nonetheless."}
{"text":"Been here forever. Dependable good food that's good for you too. Mostly vegetarian menu. Got your Madison hippy vibe in a supposed European style café."}
{"text":"I'm going to go with middle of the road here. The food itself was tasty - filling and diner fare. The potatoes were flavorful (the one's with spice on them), the eggs well cooked but not brown and the rye toast very flavorful. The young lady at the counter was ok - not overly friendly but not rude or anything. It was very quiet (as in I was one of only a few people in there at the time). The room itself is cute enough - seems clean and tables were arranged to maximize space. The walk up on the stairs was unappealing - smelling like urine which is not what I want to smell when I'm going to eat. I recognize this place may be unable to influence that - but it was offputting. Without fellow yelp reviewers I'd of turned around. Overall it was fine for diner breakfast fare."}
{"text":"i went to Madison for undergrad and this was/is by far my favorite place in Madison to eat. the food is light, tasty, and consistent. when i was in college i even wrote them an anonymous letter thanking them for having such great food and service! witout fail i always got the tuna avocado plate, or the mediteranean plate with the VINEGRETTE- wish i could bottle that and a cup of their home made soup whatever the best one that day was. will always return when i go back to visit"}
{"text":"As restaurants in Madison go, the original Sunprint is as iconic as any that has stood the test of time (almost 30 years in this case).  The large menu may put some people off-but most of them are hits with a few misses.  I usually order soup and tend to stick with the Arabic Plate, which includes most of the standbys one would expect, including tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush and a liberal helping of pita slices.  Certain tables provide a degree of privacy, while others allow you to figuratively sit on your neighbor's lap.  Go with an open mind, and you will eventually find something you like.  Also be prepared for a small amount of \"self service\" with regard to the transportation of eating utensils, napkins and water."}
{"text":"I really like the food at Sunroom.  They give generous portions, the pricing is decent, the sauces are delicious, and very veetarian friendly.  The restaurant itself is cute too with lots of art and plants, and has a nice view over State St.

I think my only complaint is one of the waitresses is mean...  The first time I went, she was utterly rude and inattentive. However, all the other times I've been there, the other waitresses were great. Another plus is that you can take your food to go."}
{"text":"I don't understand what is so great about Sunroom. The potential is all there, but the food is just mediocre... Service can either be good or awful too. Madison really lacks a great brunch place (that is reasonably priced). Too bad...."}
{"text":"Quaint place with a great street view. Breakfasts were good sized portions. The spicy tofu scrambler was particularly good!  Good coffees with soy milk available. A vegetarian oasis. Nice folks. Order and pick up at counter. The placement of the pickup behind the order line is a bit questionable. Also- lose the styrofoam to go boxes!  A very nice place and good value."}
{"text":"If this was only for breakfast I would give it five stars. This is my go to place for breakfast. The jam is amazing and every breakfast food I've had from parfait to scrambled eggs is phenomenal.
When I go for lunch or dinner it's a whole different experience. Everything is sub par or below. There's a large variety of food but never anything I want again. 
The restaurant is overall ok. I still recommend it to people that ask because the location is great and so are the smoothies. But every time I go now it's only for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great on a Saturday morning when you're hungover from celebrating the 25th reunion with college buddies. Crazy Legs was getting set to start on the Capitol steps (damn healthy people). It set the stage for a late breakfast here at the Sunroom.
Back in college, I must have walked past this place thousands of times. It's doorway and menu just a blip on the State Street radar. From the other side of the street, I'd see the place and think, 'Hmm, I should try that sometime' only to have my ADHD divert me to something shiny somewhere.
We walk up the stairs and stand in line to order at the counter. Smallish place, reminds me of a cafe. Chalkboard menu, just like a cafe. I ordered the huevos ranchero with veggie chili (that's the only chili they had) and coffee. Coffee was great as we waited for our food. I wasn't sure how to get more coffee once I was done. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to flag down someone, go up and poor myself, stand in line and pay for another cup. So I played stupid (perfected this move) and asked one of the workings girls as she passed by. She was nice enough to get me a cup. :)
Food arrives and we dig in. I honestly don't remember much as I was hungry and hungover, but I ate the whole thing. I walked out of there feeling good about the day and ready for another night of celebrating. Starting with the Essen Haus at 3pm. Damn, I missed Madison."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and I'm always a bit underwhelmed. Everything is fine, but I haven't had anything I thought was great. Nothing on the menu ever really entices me, especially don't love the dinner menu.

I do really like the smoothies, but I wouldn't dine here just for a smoothie."}
{"text":"Sunroom is a quaint, cozy place on the second floor of a building on State Street. It's a great place to get a cup of tea and a light snack and the place certainly does get a lot of natural light.

I liked their chai, which tasted fresh and unusual. I don't remember having any food there, but they do serve sandwiches and hummus-type dips with chips."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten at Sunroom Cafe but I fondly remember healthy breakfasts, tasty lunches and classy dinners that shine on State St. The space is, dur, filled with sunlight and while it can be a little warm at times, it's a great little place to grab a meal with friends and catch up. 

My favorite meal here has to be breakfast...delicious baked goods, tasty lattes, and loads of quiche. Nom Nom. As other have said - be ready for a line, especially during the weekend morning hours when college kids are rolling out of bed. The space is most certainly cramped but if you don't mind waiting in line a bit, snagging a meal is worth it. If you're coming during the lunch hours, any and all of their salads are thoroughly delightful. 

Thanks for the memories, Sunroom. Hope I see you soon!"}
{"text":"Apple wheat pancakes were gritty and they used red delicious apples, which contrary to the name, are anything but delicious.  I make homemade wheat pancakes at home all the time and they are never gritty.  They need a new recipe, I think.  It is ok for breakfast, but nothing special.  For the price, there are better, but there are worse."}
{"text":"I think this is very close to what I look for when I crave for healthy, unpretentious good lunch option. My friend and I sat next to the window that gave us lovely view of the State street. I hear that this place gets really busy during the regular semesters and for brunch, but we got lucky  - for our summer semester lunch time, the place was not crowded at all. 

I ordered turkey&avocado sandwich on wheat ($5.95). The sandwich plate came with delicious tabouli salad. The sandwich itself was alright - nothing too special, but definitely not bad. I'm picky on sandwiches, so I may be too critical. My friend ordered the special for that day, grilled chicken + mozzarella sandwich. It looked pretty good. The menu board have countless of delicious sounding sandwiches, salads, and extensive vegetarian options. And in the glass case next to the casher, there was a very good looking pie. I didn't have the room in my stomach to try it, but it sure arose my curiosity. 

Their swift service is deserving of the stars."}
{"text":"Sunroom cafe has turned into the brunch spot I go to when I have friends in town  - with them requesting to return whenever they are here! It is nice to sit by the windows and people watch on State street. The overall atmosphere is just intimate & cozy with lots of natural sunshine from all of the windows. 

I've tried a few of their dishes but I have to say that the chocolate chip whole wheat pancakes have been my favorite. The service has been hit or miss for me but I know they tend to get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place!! Loose teas, vegetarian options and homemade pastries:). I recommend the Mexican omelet! Will be back:))"}
{"text":"Fun little cafe tucked away on a second floor bldg right on State St. Small room filled with lots of college kids. :). Good food, service was fast. Yummy breakfast burrito, average omelet. Didn't get the pancakes but they looked super delicious. A great option if you're in the area and are starving!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cute place in Madison. We were seated rather quickly and our meal was huge! 
I have the cinnamon french toast and my boyfriend had some Mexican eggs burrito thing, I forget. He inhaled it. The cinnamon french toast was pretty good. I was unable to finish the whole thing it was so big! 
The service was fast and the portions were huge. I'd go back to try the pancakes."}
{"text":"Very well prepared tasty food. The wheat pancakes are a favorite.  Order at the kitchen window and find a seat (try to get one by the window).  8 am Saturday was still a good time before the lines formed."}
{"text":"This place is very, very very mediocre. The food was cold when it came to me, and it was very crowded. The food wasn't great either, it was just so \"meh.\""}
{"text":"UPDATE:  After speaking with the co-owner of this establishment, I cannot in good faith recommend this place to anyone.  The apology I received was a glancing \"sorry about that\" - far too casual for a life-threatening situation.  This person also said \"Well, people who have nut allergies usually ask if an item contains nuts.\"  This is true however there are certain things that a customer understands would not have nuts unless otherwise specified (e.g. veggie burgers).

The lack of a sincere apology or a \"how can we make this right\", and her pinning the blame back onto me, the customer, is rather disappointing... especially for a small Madison-based restaurant.  They are extremely lucky that I'm not the litigious type.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Pending on how management responds to my request for a call back, I will have to rate this cafe at mediocre.  I had ordered a veggie burger which was tasty, but caused me an instant and severe allergic reaction.  I asked the person at the counter if there were nuts in the veggie burger and she said yes and that they were Brazil nuts.  I am most allergic to Brazil nuts and had an anaphylactic reaction.  The result of this was that I had to be rushed to the hospital and medicated for up to 4 hours.

No where on the menu was there an indication that the veggie burger contained nuts (not even on the menu on their website), and I had no reason to think that it would.  My request to the management would be to include a \"contains nuts\" sign, or maybe use a different recipe for the veggie burger.  Hopefully they will take this into consideration.

And if you're allergic to nuts, do not have Sunroom Cafe's veggie burger unless you want to take a very expensive cab ride to the hospital."}
{"text":"She had the pancakes and bacon, I had the tofu scramble (regular). The bacon was crispy to the point of flying from your mouth when you bit into it, but tasty. The tofu scramble was very wet, but generous toast allowed for rounding it up. The coffee is FANTASTIC, but they make very sure you're aware there's only ONE REFILL! It is a great place to sit and relax overlooking State St.

2nd visit: came in for the steel cut oats on their Yelp! Menu but they say they've never served them.  Bad Yelp!"}
{"text":"As much as I love all the stuff I've had at Sunroom, it's definitely overpriced. Sure, the portions are okay but compared to other similar places on this end of State Street, it's a dollar or two more than what the food is worth.

The service is never super friendly either. The waitresses always seem bored and I've had one really bad experience with one before too.

I'd give the food 4 stars but then have to dock it one star for bad service and the price levels."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday morning so I had to wait for around 20 mins but the food bis generally good and tasty."}
{"text":"While waiting for a bus on State Street in the morning a group of tourists asked me where they could get inexpensive breakfast, and I told them to get in their car and gave them directions to Mickey's Dairy Bar.  I use this point to illustrate that the notion of the Sunroom hadn't even come to mind, because, well, it's just eh.  Go here for the people watching and the view of State Street if you can get score a table by a window.  The food is just isn't as fabulous as I always hope that it is-- usually because it is under spiced and the vegetarian options can lack texture. I (also) don't understand why gigantic potatoes come with everything. Nonetheless, what are you going to do? Sunroom has a monopoly on breakfast/brunch in that neighborhood... and if you/your friends are hung over do you really want to deal with transportation/walking? I have been there quite a few times and the best thing I can say about this establishment is that on some mornings it's better than me cooking myself breakfast.  Despite my own feelings about the Sunroom, visiting friends adore this place-- must be nostalgia. (as they reminisce about hungover breakfasts of yore)"}
{"text":"I might get some flack from friends who adore this place, but I don't know that's it's worthy parking near State, waiting in line and then waiting for your food... FOREVER! I'm a pretty talkative person and even I ran out of things to say to my breakfast chomping companion. I think it was 25 minutes or so before my name was called. And we both ordered veggie scrambles, which as far as I'm concerned you can throw in the same pan and separate onto two plates. Their fresh fruit was stellar though, when you consider most places pile melon into a wee little cup. This side had grapes, apples and pineapple... it was oddly the highlight of my meal. Scramble was ok, nothing special, my pancake was dry and cold and the potatoes seemed like they had been sitting out all morning. The gent who rung me up though was quite kind, they were quick to remove our dishes, but didn't rush us along, and you can't be the sunlight that pours in their second story windows. I just don't know if fruit and friendly faces are enough to make me return. (And I like fruit! Friendly people too!)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast in Madison- or anywhere for that matter. They have amazing breakfast scramblers. The food has minor ups and downs. When it's up, it's the best. But even when it's down it's better than most other places. 

Their non-breakfast food is good too. They have good pies, chili, etc."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this location. Our server was very nice and quick. Great food and not too expensive. Very close to the water too so it's a nice area to walk around."}
{"text":"I love this place; I remember coming here for as long as I can remember! They have a great variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They also have great options for people are vegetarians and vegans. The chili and the Cajun shrimp sandwich are spectacular. 

Sunroom Cafe is located on the second floor on state street which makes it an ideal place to be on game days to watch people strolling in there red and white. It has a lot of natural light with lots of windows along a wall. The bathroom is down the hall from when you get up the stairs. To me, everything about this place screams madison. It's so quaint and cozy."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review. Still four stars but I'm a bit of a bigger fan now. Now having gone there a second time, I get this a bit more. When you know what to do as far as ordering, the process is a lot less uncomfortable and intense. 

A friend and I went here for lunch the other day. It was still busy but plenty of places for the two of us to sit. Before going there this time, I looked at the menu on their website. DO THIS. Seriously! They have SO MUCH FOOD. It's overwhelming trying to read everything when you're there as you're standing in line in a crowded space.

I ordered the \"big bowl\" of vegetarian chili. Boy, was it big. And delicious! Both my friend and I really enjoyed our meals (she got a club with turkey and bacon and avocado on it), the food came out fast, and it was just over $20 for the both of us with a tip.

I have now had breakfast AND lunch here and I'm glad I gave it a second try because I think I could really grow to love this place!

I recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for brunch after a long night celebrating Halloween.
I got the smoked salmon omelette. The eggs were kind of weird, but it was delicious nonetheless.

We had a part of 7 people and they put at us at table that I can only imagine was intended for 4. The place was packed and we were starving, so I'm just glad we got to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's nice to be on State Street without feeling like you're on State Street. 

Sunroom Cafe fits the bill, since it's on the second floor and gets so much sunlight. If you've been in State Street Brats, it's like emerging from the dank and stale bowels of beery hell into a sunny and cheerful heaven where Jesus is really a hippy and possibly sports dreads.

My only complaint would be that it is located on the second floor, forcing me to climb stairs and burn precious calories. But then again, that's a good excuse to claim hunger. 

The food is pretty good here, particularly if you are a non-meat eater. This is a good place to bring your parents or visiting guests, if you want a tidy spot to eat."}
{"text":"I've never been there for lunch or dinner but I've heard it's not that good. However, their breakfast food is PHENOMENAL. I've tried many different things and they're all great. Coffee drinks and bakery items are all great too. Breakfast potatoes used to be amazing but they've been hit or miss more recently. The fruit cups always have a good variety of fresh fruit and are so tasty. This was always my go-to brunch place in Madison, and now that I've graduated, I make sure to go to Sunroom whenever I'm back. Also, now that I'm a real adult I'm realizing that their prices are a steal!"}
{"text":"I was taken aback by the entrance and how the signs instruct you to go upstairs to Sunroom Cafe. If my friend hadn't recommended it for breakfast I most likely would not have gone up since peering up the stairs it looked kind of sketchy.

Once you reach the top of the stairs, the door to the right opens up to a simplistic cute cafe. Tables and chairs are spread throughout the cafe with paintings on the wall. People are socializing over brunch, reading a book/paper or tapping away on their laptop.

Order up at the counter and then your name is called when your food is ready. Food is incredibly cheap and simple - two eggs, potatoes and bacon were $3.50 and then another $1.50 for a single pancake. Wow. Price is right and the atmosphere is cozy."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch recently with a large group, it was great to have tofu options on a brunch menu!  I got the Tofu Deluxe Scrambler and it was pretty good,.  Everyone else liked what they ordered and the menu was diverse enough to support our group of vegetarians, kids and non-vegetarians.  The atmosphere was good for a brunch too, up on the second floor off the street with big windows."}
{"text":"A little hidden place, yet surprisingly still very busy on the weekends with lines sometimes forming down the block.  They offer your usual breakfast combinations, ensuring that they do it all very well and provides a refreshing taste with every dish they serve. The staff is really welcoming and the atmosphere is very quaint. I really enjoy their roasted potatoes! It is very well-cooked and well-seasoned - a perfect compliment to all the dishes they serve. The Santa Fe Fritata comes topped with a guacamole that tastes really fresh! Pro-Tip: if you strike out with waiting times on other breakfast restaurants on state street, this is a really good option to check out, since the entrance is a little bit hard to spot and can be easily missed by many."}
{"text":"Sunroom is cozy and has great food! It's a great selection of the line isn't the whole way down the staircase. 

My favorite time to visit Sunroom is weekday mornings (see detail above). They offer great breakfast and lunch options, although I've only ever tried the breakfast. 

On my most recent visit, I got the huevos rancheros, which was excellent. I thought using their lunch chili as the ranchero sauce might be a cheap shortcut, but it worked out very well and had a lot of flavor. 

You order at the counter, grab a seat, then wait for your name to be called. 

I used the WiFi, but had to ask someone for the password. Could you post it somewhere?

Wasn't Sunroom the original place that served magic coffee?! That might be a myth. 

It's a State Street staple that's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Charming, sunny upstairs room with pretty good, straightforward, slightly hippie food:  salads, sandwiches, omelets, soups, with lots of vegetarian choices.  Beware of long waits at lunchtime whenever school is in session.  This place is more popular for brunch than dinner, but I actually like their dinner better; their breakfasts are a bit small, and come with potatoes cut into huge chunks which are kind of unseasoned and boring in the middle.  At dinner, on the other hand, there's a broad, multi-ethnic array of hearty pastas and sandwiches -- nothing fancy, nothing you couldn't make at home, but somehow utterly satisfying.  Favorite dishes here:  greek pasta, and sun scone (only when fresh.)"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for a brunch double date before embarking on a Maxwell Street Days shopping spree and had a nice experience. We expected it to be really busy since I heard it was small and it was 11:00am on a Saturday with State Street packed full of shoppers, but we only waited in line for about 5 minutes (you order at the counter and seat yourself). The food came out very fast as well. I ordered the Denver Omelette which comes with ham, cheddar cheese, mushrooms, green onion, tomatoes, green peppers, and toast & potatoes on the side. It was a pretty standard dish, but quite tasty nonetheless. There were a lot of other good-sounding food items and smoothies on the menu though that I would definitely want to come back and try.

Sunroom is somewhat of a hidden gem as the restaurant is upstairs and has no real storefront. It is a pretty small place, but has bright, warm lighting which makes the atmosphere warm and cozy. Glad I found you Sunroom, I will be back!"}
{"text":"The banana wheat pancakes would make Jack Johnson proud.
 
I knew I had to try em after seeing the dish featured in Madison Magazine's 13 Tastiest Pancakes, and I'm glad I did.

Don't go in expecting your typical light and fluffy, sweet pancakes though, as these guys are dense and hearty and sure FILL YOU UP.

The cakes themselves aren't exactly sweet, but the huge slices of warmed banana interspersed throughout the batter make up for it. No syrup necessary. 

Other than the pancakes, I've also tried a slice of chocolate hazelnut pie from here, which speaks for itself - its delicious chocolateyness certainly goes without saying.

Excited for my next visit so I can check out their more savory fare!"}
{"text":"Usually pretty bus, like most brunch places in Madison, but the atmosphere is very chill and unpretentious, and the food is solid.  Their omelettes are on point, try the one with feta and spinach."}
{"text":"I always love their daily specials: be it shrimp pasta, or pizza
Their Dutch Mocha is all good!
This place can be crowded on weekends, so come early if you want to enjoy your meals while overlooking State street from your spot. 
The service is good. It's actually self-service if you have less than 6 people in your table. 
I tried their asparagus pasta, and it was good. Tho, the after effect was not that pleasant (I hope you know what I mean). 
On my next visits, I tried something else: pancake, omelette, tuna sandwich. And yes, they are good, good, good :)
The place is convenient too (On State street!) so, feeling hungry after studying the whole morning? come here and your tummy will be happy and smiley!"}
{"text":"Seriously, every fucking eatery in town now offers a garlic-y burger with some bleu cheese on it.  I think you can get a McGarlic at McDonald's now. 

Un-original menu offerings withstanding, Sunroom Cafe is a nice little place to grab a bite to eat on State St. if you're looking for something:

A.  not a chain
B. kinda granola"}
{"text":"A UW tradition, that serves healthy food in good portions at great prices.  Lovely vegetarian options, such as the veggie chili and beautiful salads.  The Arab Salad offers hummus, baba ganoush and tabouli  on a bed of gorgeous greens with fresh pita.  Meat eaters will not be disappointed by the offerings here in sandwiches and pasta dishes.  Nice breakfasts also.  Very popular so expect lines during peak hours, but things move along quickly.  During the day you pick up your food at the counter, but at dinner there is table service.  Another thing I enjoy about Sunroom is that (unlike most restaurants at this price and service point) they do not use any disposable plates or flatware--just paper napkins.  Good drink menu of sodas to smoothies to some wine and beer."}
{"text":"I love Sunroom! It is such a cozy, truly sunny place to sit and dine above the chaos of State Street. There is always a great display of artwork on show, usually by local artist. And you are sure to find yourself amogst an interesing crowd of students, professors, and stumble-ins. Get a window seat if you can!

The food is neither terrible nor great. The menus are extensive and offer an excellent selection of vegetarian options. The food is always fresh, but what you see is pretty much what you get. The prices and the portion sizes are small. Nevertheless, one of my favorite places to grab a cuppa and sit back and relax..."}
{"text":"Came here after being quite hungover from Freakfest (which was a blast by the way and I highly recommend going). While we had to wait on a flight of steps for about 40 minutes to get seated, the food was well worth it, they serve bloody Mary's and mimosas, and the service was great. 

We were lucky enough to get seated by a window which had wonderful morning views of downtown. 

I had the tofu scramble with a side of avocado (always a breakfast side staple) and it was delicious. However, I opted for the spicy option and had to put hot sauce on for a decent kick. Our waitress was lovely and we were checked on by other waitstaff as well. 

4 stars because of the women's bathroom and decor-- the women's stall was teeny tiny, my chair was quite uncomfortable, and both the bathroom and restaurant had no updates in recent years. Normally I don't mind but when it affects my comfort level, I do. 

Overall, this is a fantastic Sunday brunch stop."}
{"text":"Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth... and it's called SUNROOM CAFE!

The ONLY place for breakfast on State Street.  Great staff.  Great art (switches all the time).  Great menu selection.  GREAT FOOD!  The atmosphere is awesome.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for any college student and/or family visiting on the weekend.

BLESS THE SUNROOM CAFE!"}
