{"text":"So glad our host, Michel, Studio Living B&B, suggested this 24 hr diner for a late meal after checking in. We had poutine at other restaurants but this by far was the best. One negative: no alcohol, canned sodas only. I believe you can bring your own wine, but you would want to confirm that."}
{"text":"Menu du genre \"diner\" Américain.  Le club sandwich est excellent, les frites aussi. Ils ont aussi un menu table d'hôte qui change périodiquement, avec des repas complets, ragoûts, poissons, pâtes, etc.  Les prix sont abordables; c'est ouvert 24h/24; les serveurs sont efficaces, etc. Un excellent choix quand on ne cherche pas de la haute gastronomie, mais qu'on veut  quand même bien manger."}
{"text":"This was my first place to try Canada poutine.   GREAT FOOD. Interesting people.   Must have.  Done."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff overall... opens 24 hours and you know where to go when you get hungry at 3 in the morning..."}
{"text":"This would be the Quebec equivalent of a diner. The atmosphere is nothing fancy, and it serves all-day breakfast along with sandwiches and about 10 types of poutine. I had the chicken poutine which had some unappetizing grey-green peas from frozen, but the French fries in the gravy were great.  The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to experience local fare during my recent visit to Montreal and after reading some yelp reviews decided to try this place in the Gay Village. I went for lunch and was not disappointed! This hole-in-the-wall kitschy place with the ceramic pigs and the gay following is right up my alley. There are over 10 different kinds of poutine to try as well as sandwiches and other casual dishes a la Canadian (with gravy, tons of gravy!).   Our waitress didn't speak English, but since the menu is in both French & English we were able to communicate. You can tell everyone there was local, which is always a good sign! And being this is a local place, the prices were very reasonable.   I had the chicken poutine and my friend had the burger poutine. They were both delicious. Go with an empty stomach because we both ordered the \"petit\" version and it was still way to big to finish! I had poutine at some places in Montreal, but I have to say the best poutine was had here. Another friend ordered the hot chicken sandwich...beware this isn't a regular hot chicken sandwich, it's drenched in gravy. Breakfast is served all day, so another friend tried their breakfast and was also satisfied.   All in all, I liked it! I would definitely be back to try something else if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered breakfast and instead of serving the toast right away, we had to wait until our meals were ready (which also took a long while). My table was not offered any coffee refills and basically the servers never returned to check on us. If they weren't bringing out the food, then they would be standing in the front.  As another yelper mentioned, the food was mediocre. There are many restaurants nearby with better service."}
{"text":"Worst food I had in Montreal. We essentially paid the check and left. Should have trusted your instinct when no-one else was there."}
{"text":"Amazing Diner! Great food, open late, good prices! I had the regular club sandwich, my partner had the mexivillage poutine, both were delicious. I go every time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I thought it wise to at least try the poutine. Being my first time ever eating it, there was SOME apprehension about how good it could be, and I got a combo with a chicken club to hedge my bet. Turns out that the club sandwich had nothing on the poutine. I have no comparison for it, but in terms of tasty food, theirs comes in high on my list!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Had to come back because I ordered a simple poutine, and if you can imagine, the fries were under cooked! I'd recommend going here only if you're wasted."}
{"text":"I've only been to the place twice in 2 years but I find that the food tastes better after a bar trip. The place is small so you would have to tuck your elbows while trying to maneuver your way into your poutine.    I make it a point to check out a food place's washroom as it is my benchmark on quality control.  A dirt spot on one of its walls has never been touched since last year, so unless it's \"organic\" paint, then somebody has selective blindness."}
{"text":"We live just a block over from this establishment and at 4 am in the morning after a night of drinking we finally decided  to give this restaurant a try.  It's a friendly small diner with your typical diner options (sandwiches, burgers, breakfasts, etc.).  They don't have many vegetarian options but our server suggested the tofu club sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. It was served with a side of deliciously prepared fries with just the right amount of crisp and flavour. The tofu on the sandwich had as much flavour as your meaty equivalent and was prepared to perfection.  The servers and environment were friendly and welcoming.  Now that I know what this resto has to offer they should probably get use to our faces ;)"}
{"text":"Poutine is one of those things I have to have when I'm back in Canada - it's on the menu at pretty much any place you can get a hamburger. I was recently in Montreal for a conference for a few days. Since Poutine is Quebcoise food, so was determined to not have just ANY Poutine, but the best version of it I could find. After a so so version at a deli, and reading competing claims about various places, we decided to check out this place, in the heart of the Gay Village. The menu had a lot of options, but looking around the room, everyone was having poutine, either as a main or a side.  My husband and I split a large, which was more than enough for two hungry people. There were a lot of options - Poutine with mushrooms, with vegetables, with pepperoni, with sausages, with everything. We decided to go with Bacon as a topping, which was a good choice - the bacon was thick, crispy, and generously portioned. But the main event is the Poutine itself. The fries were great - large cut and crunchy - the gravy super hot, meaning that the cheese curds were mostly melted by the time it was served. Definitely going back next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall, gay-friendly place is decked out with kitchy ceramic pigs and has a cozy diner feel.   It's a local spot that's open 24 hours in the Village and a great place to get late-night poutine after the bars let out...but that's about it.  The food is  simple Quebecoise comfort food (poutine, hot chicken sandwiches, pudding Chomeur) and breakfast items but it's nothing you couldn't make at home.   The portions are large- do not try to tackle an order of poutine by yourself and the prices are reasonable.  A big downside is the staff. I've gotten attitude there from one male employee on a few occasions and I still don't know why. That alone is a huge letdown. I hate when staff acts annoyed by patrons- I get it, you'd rather not be here but it's what you signed up for (this is coming from a person who's done their time in the food service industry.)   I really want to like this place but the unmemorable and sometimes bland food just doesn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Came in here around midnight on a Monday night -- place was pretty empty which was great because it made for a really nice, quiet wind down experience. All we got was a small order of poutine and it was massive! Barely finished it between the two of us! Waiter was extremely friendly and the entire vibe was just super quaint -- highly recommended, seemed like a great little spot!"}
{"text":"Not really much to say.   Small diner open 24 hours right off Ste-Catherine St. The smoked meat poutine wasn't great; the fries were soggy and scarce, the gravy was flavorless, and the service was meh. My girlfriend got the pogo trio which was pretty lackluster. It was just a small pogo, some unseasoned fries, and a soft drink.   Not a very memorable place, but I guess it's okay for a quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"We have just returned from Montreal, celebrating the Divers Cite. Had several meals at Le Resto Du Village and it was fantastic. Small, cozy, comfortable, inexpensive, friendly, and great food. Can't say enough good thiings about the place. Just off St. Catherine on Wolfe, so a bit off the beaten track, more locals than tourists. If you want a small diner experience, with the French ambience, and amazing poutine you must check out this gem!!!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot when we first arrived to Montreal.  I had a chef's salad that was out of this world!  I couldn't even see the lettuce under all of the fresh veggies (green, orange and yellow bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, celery) and the Italian dressing was creamy and delicious.  My bf had a caesar salad that he also raved about.  For dinner I had a BLT which was everything a BLT should be and my bf had a chicken and tomato club that, aside from the chicken being a bit dry, was decent diner food.  The peppercorn gravy poutine was interesting, but I probably wouldn't eat it.  This was my first time experiencing poutine and I guess I am just not a fan.  Overall, the food was satisfying and affordable.  We will probably hit this place up once more before leaving the city."}
{"text":"Dennis, my partner and I, call this \"The Pig Restaurant\" as they have so many little ceramic pigs that decorate the dining room.   I love this tiny restaurant in the heart of the gay village! Open 24 hrs, this French Quebec cafe has everything from soups, sandwiches, poutine, great coffee, braised beef and carrots, hamburger steak, homemade desserts, yummy breakfasts, and so much more.   I love it that I can have all choices at any time. Prices are cheap, cheap, cheap!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  I had high hopes for this place, the pictures looked so good! I was a bit let down but that could be because I ordered the wrong thing. I went for the pogo trio. I thought they made their own pogo's but it's just the name brand with some home made fries. For 7.49, one pogo and some fries?? Not worth it. My boyfriend got the cheese burger trio and there was no cheese on it. Also the meat was just eh. He did get a poutine on the side and now that's the stuff! Poutine is excellent. I even asked for some of their gravy to dip my fries in. It was an extra 2$ though, for sauce only.  I would only go back for the poutine."}
{"text":"Only eat here when you're drunk and it's the only thing open. The food is really mediocre and the service is bitchy. I got the \"chinese\" shrimp and noodles. It was macaroni with disgustingly salty canned shrimp. I'm not sure what I was thinking ordering that, but it was so disgusting I couldn't eat it. My friend's poutine was very mediocre. Overlooked fries. I've had better poutine at a fast food restaurant.  I'm not trying to be bitchy, but this place is not good."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my co workers. I decided to order hot dogs with fries. I didnt really like the fries as i find them dry and flavorless. The hot dog was okay. I mean it was a regular hot dog. Nothing special. I might have take their poutine instead because thats what they are most known for. But i didnt find it special whatsoever. Maybe i will try their poutine next time."}
{"text":"New owners have ruined this place.  It used to be a fun, quirky, gay restaurant complete with the gay colors and lots of interesting collections of pigs and cash registers, etc.  It has been my breakfast restaurant of choice for 15 years.  According to a public post that the new owners put up on Facebook, they have had a disagreement with the previous owner post-sale and have chosen to make a public rebuke of him.  I don't care who is right is that argument.....it is wrong to make a public issue of it and place blame like the new owners have done.  And they have redesigned the inside decor to feature modern browns and grays, removing all of the gay decor.  They have disrespected the long running tradition of this gem and they deserve to fail.  You couldn't pay me to eat here again."}
{"text":"We stopped by after 11pm to grab a bite to eat and it was definitely worth it. The food was cheap and was really tasty."}
{"text":"Un peu en retrait, un peu au sud de la rue Sainte-Catherine, se cache un petit trésor spécialisé dans le comfort food.   Ici, vous vous régalerez de poutines (un nombre incroyable de variétés), de pâtes italiennes ou encore d'un méga-copieux gargantuesque \"petit\" déjeuner de style anglais.   Ouvert 24h sur 24, idéal pour une dent creuse au petit matin."}
{"text":"Poutine = aces.  Thanks for rec, Yelpers!  I wouldn't call the location of this place the \"heart\" of Le Village, more like its south side, but it was cozy, cheap and cheery.  Plus, really, the poutine was delicious."}
{"text":"A delicious BYO classic in the Village, cozy, friendly, not-fancy but warmly lit and nice enough for a casual date. I can't say too much about the food, only that I went with the heavily recommended Poutine Galvaude - poutine with freshly roasted chicken and peas and gravy and cheese curds. It was the perfect cosy Quebec meal. The gravy was tasty, the fries were thick cut and fresh, and the whole thing went perfectly with the cans of Belle Geulle I brought from the dep. My friend had the Hot Chicken Sandwich, another classic, and he seemed deeply happy with his life choices. The menu is thick so I think there's lots of other good ways to go here.   I loved the waiter and the feeling of welcome and comfort, I will be back often."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall diner just off St Catherine St. filled with locals. Basic food, nothing special, but satisfying and easy. Open 24/7."}
{"text":"Little neighborhood gem. Friendly staff. Not fancy at all. Prefect place to dine or brunch when u don't feel like to be seen. You can tell many of the customers have been there for years and probably several times a week, which adds the neighborhood charm even more.  Solid comfort food you can count on. This place reminds me of the good old days when things are simpler in life."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch after helping a friend move into a new apartment. Good choice it was! I had the croque monsieur which was pretty good and a pile of fries. The fries were also really good. Seriously, does everyone in Montreal actually make their own???   Anyways, this is a fun, no frills dining experience and as I have learned, a place to end up after the bars close."}
{"text":"I felt immediately 'at home' visiting here each morning as I vagabonded around Montreal and the Village area. No-nonsense characterful diner. Cheap and cheerful egg dishes, cooked the way you like. One of my favorite parts of the day was starting off at this charming diner."}
{"text":"The bed and breakfast i was staying at for a conference had breakfast but I really wanted to have a nice sit down breakfast on my last day in Montreal. As noted in other reviews the restaurant is just into the village and definitely seems focused on serving the local residents in that area (a number of rainbow items in the cafe) and of course, also a number of cool pig themed items. For breakfast, among other things, they offer a number of omelets and....one of my favorite breakfast items, eggs benedict (several types, including one with asparagus and another with crab). Coffee was provided right away and it was only a short time till breakfast arrived with a nice side of home fries. As others have noted the national dish of Canada, poutine, seems to be a popular item but could just not see having that for breakfast.   Overall, a cool (and somewhat funky) little place that is popular with the locals and for breakfast, a good solid choice away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist area - worth going to at least one morning when you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Really, this review is pretty much just for the poutine. I was in Montreal for a week and did a challenge to eat the best poutine in town.   This was right up there.   I thought the gravy was good, not quite great, but they had everythign properly melty and the service was really good. Also, it was the only place open at 4am around there that served it!   The prices are fantastic, nearly amazing, actually. I actually had to look at the price and say 'did they forget something?' to myself. I love when that happen!"}
{"text":"Poutin!!! Smoked meat = delicious cubed ham. Get the du Resto Poutine if you want to be happy in life."}
{"text":"Ce resto du Village je l'aime. Pour l'originalité du nom on repassera. Mais pour le reste, rien à dire. On retrouve les classiques d'un diner, mais aussi des plats du jour et des formules intéressantes. Ouvert 24h, il est certes moins bien placé que ses voisins de la rue Ste-Catherine mais le détour mérite d'être fait en cas de petit creux en pleine nuit, je vous le garantis. Vous y gagnerez en qualité des plats, en qualité de service et y serez bien plus à l'aise. J'y ai toujours été bien accueilli et servi, jamais pressé de partir car la petitesse du lieu le rend très confortable. Certes on n'est pas dans la haute gastronomie mais ce n'est vraiment pas ce qu'on recherche en venant ici, et les plats bien que simples restent très bons. Attention en cas de forte affluence (sorties de clubs, etc) les tables sont prises rapidement !"}
{"text":"Best Poutine in town,  open 24hrs but not open Mondays! Forget that other place that has tons of selections, this ones authentic...secrets in the sauce!  March 2018, under new ownership so I was concerned it would change its poutine and thankfully that wasn't the case!   A few changes to note; Portion on the small is much smaller, it's actually better since before the portion was so big that I felt like a beached whale eating the whole thing to myself because it's so good but honestly was too much! I also had a burger which was the same old fashion delicious small burger. I feel they missed an opportunity to really update the menu, considering the poutine is carb heaven they could've added some lighter food like a non carb lettuce wrap burger, for the guilt ridden junk food junkie!   My biggest disappointment was the decor. First off it was fucken cold in the place, maybe blame it on them opening hastily so we'll see.   Ok, to be fair we don't go to RDV for the decor but since they did the Reno's and put a nice penny in the place they could've put a little more warmth to the place! The lighting is horrible, it's like being a hospital waiting room with fluorescent lighting...quick fix, change the bulbs to a warmer light and add dimmers, don't think at 3 am you feel like wearing sunglasses to eat lol, c'est pas chaleureux!  Alright it's a step above from before but unfortunately missed the mark on the atmosphere. It won't stop me from coming here because the poutine is still one of the best, it's just sad the guys did some nice renovations but the place, albeit has been open for two days, at the moment it has no soul."}
{"text":"Just returned to our hotel at 1:30AM from the best plate of poutine I've ever had. The owner was gracious and polite, brought us everything with a smile and checked in a few times while we ate. The place was exactly as we expected - small and cozy with funky decor (most noticeably the ceramic pigs Matthew A. mentioned in his review). We weren't sure how quiet or busy it would be at this hour on a Saturday night, but more customers arrived as we sat... singles, couples, small groups and by the time we left, about half the tables were occupied. It was great to find a place open 24 hours, especially on a holiday (Thanksgiving/Columbus Day) weekend.  The menu is quite extensive, with variations on each item. We were tempted by poutine all dressed (pepperoni, mushroom, onions and peppers - the poutine equivalent of a steak bomb sub) as well as many other items, but decided to start simple and try more complex options another time, so we went with the large plate with mushrooms added. The desserts also looked good, though we were quite full after splitting the large poutine and had to pass. The poutine was layered perfectly with gooey cheese throughout and plenty of gravy and mushrooms for each bite.  Le Resto Du Village is exactly what a 24 hour diner should be - delicious, generous inexpensive portions, funky atmosphere, friendly and efficient staff and welcoming."}
{"text":"For people who live in the village, this is a staple spot where we go after the bars on the weekend. For people visiting, this is an experience that you should cherish. After a big night out, there is nothing best than a Poutine to brighten you night or  expand your tommy. Either way, you are going to live a moment of joy until the next day"}
{"text":",      .  ,        .   ,   .     .  .    ,  .   OMG I just regret to eat poutine at the old montreal area which somebody recommend at a travel book. It was so expensive and they served normal fries which is same with Mcdonald's french fries. And I paid $18 included tips. And I was disappointed about poutine. But I just change mind. It was good poutine I ate at 5am this restaurant. I just stop by montreal to go to mont-tremblant. I serched yelp then I found here. It was good and  I will recommend to my homies."}
{"text":"You have to stop by this staple diner in the village after a night out since it's open 24/7. This time I tried French Onion Soup since it was freezing out. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Nice little place located right off of Rue St. Catherine.  Huge plates of speciality poutines seem to be a hallmark of this place. Right in the heart of Montreal's Gay Village.  I had the smoked meat poutine, which seemed like regular poutine with slices of ham. I'm not the biggest poutine fan in the world, but I like to have it every once in a while. It tasted fine. I can usually eat a lot, but the small plate I ordered was huge and I couldn't finish it all there.   A gripe - we went on a slow day, and yet service was quite slow."}
{"text":"It's a cute, hole in the wall kind of a place that's mostly for locals of the gay village.   I ordered the hot chicken sandwich with french fries while my friends ordered different versions of poutine (chicken and another with meat). I cannot be bothered to eat poutine. One of two bites is good enough for me, but i cannot stomach an entire plate of that. Anyhoo, my hot chicken sandwich was not what i expected. It was literally drenched in gravy. So much so that the bread was like soggy newspaper. Not to say that the chicken inside, smothered in a little of the gravy outside wasn't good, but i like my hot sandwiches to be HOT and CRUNCHY. Not soggy and wet.  I wouldn't say it was bad. At all. It was pretty good and all my friends enjoyed their meals. Give it a shot if you're in the area and if you get the chicken sandwich, tell them you want the gravy on the side, unless you're into soggy bread."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place!!! I was craving a home cooked breakfast, no frills, a chez mon oncle type...this place is perfect, delishis food, coffee kept flowing, which I needed. I will be back for sure... service was wonderful too.  Well priced, which is mush appreciated.  I will tell my friends, indeed!!!"}
