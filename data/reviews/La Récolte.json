{"text":"This restaurant seems unassuming, but serious cooking with a focus on local ingredients is going on here. For brunch I had two freshly made crepes with chanterelles, etc between them and a 'Caesar' sauce and a soft-boiled egg on top. The mix of flavours was excellent. I also enjoyed my chat with the engaging chef (I sat at the counter).  Now I plan to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Un menu avec des produits locaux qui change aux 2 semaines : j'étais déjà convaincue - résultat ultra savoureux, service excellent et rapide (un dimanche à 14h c'est vrai) - I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Staffs are super friendly and the food there is really good and fresh. I was sitting in front of the kitchen and I could see how they were made and how the plate were decorated (I felt like I was watching a food show live lol). It's a small place and food is around more than $20 per person but it's totally worth to give a try! Make sure to make a reservation as to not wait in line :) And also they change their menu every week or so :) it's good so that when you come back and you can try new plates!"}
{"text":"Une place très sympa pour un petit déjeuner. 
Par contre, je trouve que leur prix est un peu cher pour la quantité qu'on a :-)   En général, le service et les plats qu'on a commandé sont très bien!"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé.

Ouvert depuis juin, ce petit local offre des brunchs les samedis et dimanches. Le reste de la semaine, le restaurant est fermé et l'équipe se concentre sur leur service de traiteur ou des cours de cuisine sur mesure. 

Tout est bio et équitable et local le plus possible. Environ 80-85% des ingrédients proviennent de Montréal ou d'un maximum de 100 km autour. Les cuisines font affaires directement avec les producteurs. Fraîcheur & santé dans les assiettes! 

Le service est super convivial. S'il y a une place de libre à la table, le serveur s'y assoie pour nous expliquer le menu et la philosophie de l'endroit. On se sent chez soi. 

Au menu à l'ardoise changeant toutes les semaines, 4 plats à moins de 20$ et un dessert sont offerts. Personnellement, j'ai opté pour la formule \"découverte au choix du chef en 2 service\" pour 25$. J'ai pu goûter 6-7 plats différents en petites quantité. Mon coup de coeur va au feuilleté (style vole-au-vent) rempli de porc braisé, sauce crémeuse et légumes. 

Comme breuvages, le smoothie du jour était délicieux (bien qu'un peu petit à mon goût), les cappuccinos servis dans de petits verres en vitre sont également parfaitement texturés. Pour ceux qui brunchent tard, vins et bières sont disponibles. 

Bref, on aime la philosophie, c'est bon et c'est chaleureux. Sans aucune prétention."}
{"text":"An awesome restaurant that does local (for what it's worth) food well. We had the French toast and the lobster Benedict. 
Both were excellently done and well portioned. We were very full at the end of the meal. 

We were able to get a seat in front of the kitchen so we got to see the action. It definitely is nice to see the effort they put in. 

Being English speakers in a French province, it is much appreciated that they were very welcoming even though we could only butcher a bit of French. 

Only downside I would say is the slushes are a bit too watery for my liking. 

Aside from that, great food, great service! Also a great location as Jean talon market is right down the street."}
{"text":"Le concept à la base est excellent, car on sait que les aliments seront de qualité. Par contre, le menu est décevant car peu d'options. Belle présentation mais les portions nous laissent vraiment sur notre appétit (je ne suis pas un gros mangeur et j'avais encore faim après le repas). Le prix trop élevé (50$ pour deux \" brunchs \" avec café) pour ce que nous avons dégusté."}
{"text":"Nous avons découvert ce restaurant par Le Cahier.
Belle découverte. Brunch du dimanche nouveau genre, avec trois propriétaires cuisiniers passionnés. Ils apprêtent les aliments biologiques du terroir de façon originale."}
{"text":"Great local food.
Creative, taste and well made.
Very welcoming and smiling personnel."}
{"text":"Agréable surprise que ce menu de brunch. Tout semblait succulent. J'ai pour ma part mangé des tomates frites accompagnées de mais, haricots et bacon, le tout nappé d'une sauce sudouest. Je recommande fortement"}
{"text":"Review from 2013: A Montreal MUST.. Try this tiny place out before it gets too popular and everyone finds out about it, you won't be disappointed. I have only been once so far but will be going back regularly. Menu changes every weekend (see their website on Fridays). We had a few choices for brunch but decided to take the shared menu, where you pay 25$ to get a taste of everything... So worth it! The Cake de crevettes with hollandaise sauce and an egg was delicious, although I can't really recommend a plate due to the changing menu.

Service was also great. Our waiter came to sit with us to explain the whole menu in detail and answer all of our questions. Overall great experience and will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Really nice small space, friendly service and excellent food! Went for brunch and had a great time, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I go to La Recolte and surely won't be my last. The food is always amazing. Fresh flavors, exquisite taste and 5 star service. I can not wait to return to this place."}
{"text":"Cool place!  Their value prop is that they use all local products.  The menu varies as seasons change.

Sit at the counter to have a great view on the kitchen teamwork!"}
{"text":"Everything was exceptionally fresh and the dishes were very inspired! Great brunch, we'll definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"J'ai adore!!!! L'utilisation des legumes de saoson un vrai delice. Service impeccable!!!  Fortement recommande"}
{"text":"Recolte was an after thought for us, a mistake that worked out well. We went to a restaurant for brunch a mile or so away that was not open when we arrived. We found Recolte and it was great. This place is small and quaint with an open kitchen which is something I really enjoy. I think it makes a very family atmosphere happen in the restaurant. The menu THAT DAY was a traditional benedict, crepe, frittata like breakfast, and then one other thing I do not remember. We had everything except the dish I do not remember. No matter they are farm to table, local, and seasons. What I had on the chalk board menu that day will certainly not be what you see. They are very veg friendly so be open to what they cook and enjoy it. The food was not off the wall but true to form farm to table and creative. With that they have some special blended drinks with rhubarb which were quite good. I appreciate the fact that there were 4 things on their menu for that day because they are making a big statement when that is all they offer. The food was good, service was good, and I will return."}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant near Jean Talon market serving brunch. A small menu on a chalkboard of four dishes but this likely changes depending on the season. They serve mainly locally sourced ingredients. We could not understand any of the four dishes but the server was very nice and explained each to us. All of the dishes are eclectic with combinations of ingredients not usually associated with brunch. We had a blood sausage salad with fried hash brown, and a rhubarb sauce. The second dish was a pastry with mushrooms, celery and a melted Quebec cheese. They were both very delicious, rich in flavour."}
{"text":"Excellente!  Le menu change selon la saison.  La bouffe est très bien présenté et le tout est préparé avec de l'amour.  Une place à découvrir!"}
{"text":"Wow! Le meilleur brunch que j'ai eu depuis un moment. D'abord une philosophie : manger local, frais et de préférence bio. Ensuite, la présentation et le goût doivent être au rendez vous. Et les deux propriétaires veillent à ce que tout soit respecté. Franchement chapeau! Bel endroit!"}
{"text":"I went there a few times and was never dissapointed. Food is always on point, tasty and fresh. The menu os changing according to local harvests which is a plus. They (almost) only serve made out of local products. In terms of service, nothing to complain about either. Don't be afraid to try out anything that's suggested. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Endroit assez mignon.
Une carte qui change toutes les semaines pour le brunch et qui utilise des produits de saison c'est vraiment cool comme façon de faire et j'aime ça.
Mes oeufs bénédictines aux homard étaient bons mais trop léger. Je critique pas la quantité de homard mais l'accompagnement. 23$ pour des oeufs béné tu attends un peu plus d'accompagnement que 4-5 hashbrown et des petites feuilles de salade. Sérieux mec tu veux que je fasse une fringale ou quoi ?
C'est bon mais concrètement pour mon plat cela ne valait pas le prix payé ... Il faudra mettre de la consistance pour que je revienne ...
Service correcte."}
{"text":"Walked into this casual eatery located near the Jean Talon market as the doors opened for Sunday brunch with no reservations but we were lucky to be seated since the place quickly filled up! The venue is casual and simple with a chalkboard menu that changes regularly as everything is locally sourced and organic.

Started with a rhubarb mimosa which was perfectly tangy and ordered the spanakopita dish which was served with greens, string beans, and beets, a swirl of yogurt, and of course spanakopita topped with an egg; being Greek, I had to try it! The dish was exquisite: the beets were perfect, the side salad and beans were tangy and delicious, and the pie with its flaky phyllo, feta, spinach and dill filling were exceptional, if not better than my mom's ! 

The portions were perfect sized and the price was right for this unpretentious venue serving some beautifully presented and well prepared dishes. I'm definitely going back for their evening menu!!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch du dimanche! 
Une vitrine difficile à voir de la route qui nous a valu de perdre la dernière table vacante: victime de son succès, l'endroit est restreint il ne sera pas rare d'attendre pour obtenir une place. 
Un menu pour le moins original avec des produits frais de saison et des vins bios! Une assiette attrayante pour un goût réconfortant le tout dans une belle cuisine ouverte et une ambiance décontractée. Un service enjoué vous donnera l'impression d'aller manger chez un ami :) 
La récolte a été bonne!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday. We were all blown away by the quality, creativity, and execution. Food tasted really fantastic and portion sizes were perfect. We all ordered different dishes from the very limited but well-crafted menu. Service was a bit slow but being that the servers also worked in the kitchen, it was easy to forgive. Was pretty empty which was surprising, perhaps still undiscovered. Highly recommended little nook."}
{"text":"Had a yummy Sunday brunch: tasty Egg Benedict with crabs + apple-gin and  a donut with rhubarb. Great service. On the pricey side though."}
{"text":"La Récolte has excellent staff, beautiful presentation and plating, and a nice varied selection of meals that cater to omnivores and vegetarians alike.

Chef Owner Étienne was happy to offer variations on some of the plates to make vegetarian versions, and was very accommodating.

I called around 8:30 PM and was told that while the kitchen closes at 10 PM, they are flexible.

I intended to arrive at 9:15, but ended up arriving at 9:45.  The restaurant was still packed with clientele, but I had no trouble getting a seat at the bar.  As I write this, it's 11:20 PM and the place is still half full!

I'm pleased to say that the service here is excellent, and the staff really impressed me with their attentiveness!  I really appreciate the personal touches, when Étienne introduced himself, and took time to go over the different menu items and variations.

I decided to forgo the appetizer and begin with a main course - a wild mushroom platter that came with grilled cucumbers, roasted carrots, and rolls of naked oats.  The mushrooms were perfectly cooked, the sauce was delicious, and the sprinkling of crunchy oats provided a nice counterpoint to the softness of the vegetables!  I've never tried naked oats before, but I really enjoyed the rolls of soft cooked oats wrapped in leaves.

I paired this with a dessert wine from France that was a very pleasant accompaniment.

For dessert, I couldn't choose between the two options and decided to go for both.  The chef very kindly offered to make me a sampler dish so I could try both!

The mead-poached peach and bay-leaf-flavoured semifreddo was a first for me, and while I found it interesting, the smattering of sour raspberries was a little too intense for my tastes.  I did enjoy the crumble a lot, and I'll note that the bay leaf flavour was quite interesting; while not my favourite thing, it was very distinctive without being overpowering.

The standout dessert was the honey cake with sunflower seed pralines candied in maple syrup.  The white cheese reminded me of a very mild, thick, sour cream.  The wild cherries were sour but not excessively so.  My favourite part was the sweet bottom layer!

The experience was enough to inspire me to write this as I sit at the bar!  I haven't even left yet, but I already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"One of Montreal's hidden gems. Little cozy restaurant that uses local and organic ingredients. My friend and I sat at the bar and it was really cool to see what went on in the open kitchen that was right in front of our eyes. There were 2 members working in the kitchen as well as another staff member who seemed to be working both inside and outside. Each dish was prepared with patience and precision. We got the velvet of squash soup and mozzarella de bufflonne to start with. The soup was perfectly seasoned and smooth. The mozzarella de bufflonne was comprised of many interesting items, the tomatoes were fresh and moist, squash puree was a nice touch, pickeled squash added a nice hint of acidity to the dish, broccoli was nice and crisp, and mozzarella was decent. For the mains we got the canard and spaghetti maison. The duck was cooked beautifully, nice generous portions, and the gnocchi, parsnips, broccoli were cooked to perfection. The spaghetti was also impeccable. The sauce was flavorful, nicely seasoned. Spaghetti was cooked nicely. The apple pie dessert was a great way to end the meal. My friend and I aren't usually fans of apple pies but they nailed it. Unlike most american apple pies, it wasn't too sweet and the pastry was baked to a light crisp. Overall, great food, great service, nice atmosphere. J'aime!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch. Love the concept; all the produces and foods are taken from local groceries, everything is in season to insure the best possible fresh flavours."}
{"text":"I loved the place, the staff was really friendly and helpful! Since they didn't have anything vegan on the menu the waiter asked the chef to come to the table and he offered to make a special vegan dish for me! The food was really delicious!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleur brunchs qu'on a essayé, et il est bien situé pas loin du plaza st.hubert! C'est sûr qu'on reviendra pour goûter des autres plats. Le service est excellent également."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Highly recommend. Benedictine was unbelievable. Grilled cheese to die for. Short walk from Marche Jean-Talon. Excellent service by chefs/owners. Great way to close out a fab weekend in Montreal"}
{"text":"Nice spot near Jean-Talon market, the staff was friendly and they serve local food. Everything was fresh, light and delicious."}
{"text":"Brunch/déjeuner de qualité dans Rosemont/Petite-Patrie ! Localisé sur la rue Bélanger, non loin de la Plaza St-Hubert, ce petit bistro sans prétention, bio-local responsable, vous sert les fins de semaines, un brunch/déjeuner de qualité. Dimanche 3 janvier 2016, 11am, restaurant rempli dû à sa popularité, mais avons eu quand même 2 places au bar devant la cuisine sans attente. Ma copine & moi avons pu observer l'équipe de cuisiniers préparaient les différents plats. Bons lattés. Mes oeufs bénédictine (19$) étaient succulents et de qualité avec leur chorizo maison et pain bénédictine maison. La truite poêlée (17$) de ma copine était aussi bonne. Leur menu change assez souvent, donc peut-être que vous n'allez pas avoir ces items au menu. Prix et service sympa. Bref, un de nos meilleurs brunchs à Montréal au niveau qualité et ambiance tranquille de bistro. Wifi gratuit.

5/5 visité en janvier 2016"}
{"text":"Première visite dans ce petit restaurant (une trentaine de couverts) proche du marché Jean Talon.
Les assiettes sont belles, le service irréprochable et vraiment sympathique, et c'est une très bonne idée que de n'utiliser que des produits locaux.
Mais dommage pour nous, la saveur de nos assiettes n'a pas été à la hauteur des élogieux commentaires entendus sur la qualité du brunch de La Récolte.
Je reste un peu sur ma faim."}
{"text":"Brunch de qualité qui sert des produits locaux et aui chqnge de menu à toutes les fins de semaine. Très belle situation géographique à coté de la plaza Saint-Hubert. Possibilité de réservation, très bon point étant donner l'espace disponible."}
{"text":"My first visit at this very popular resto...
