{"text":"Fresh, local, affordable. These are a few of my favourite things.   Soup du Jour is a place I wish I knew about before. I walk Main St constantly but I feel it's a place that's hard to keep up with all the changes (even if said changes are years old). It whole heartedly beats Tim Hortons, Subway, Mr. Sub... whatever. It's fresh ingredients with REAL chicken (thank you CBC Marketplace for ruining chain locations for me).   I love the local farm fresh produce. I always look for establishments that support our local farmers!   The two young ladies working were so extremely friendly. They ran me through all the ingredients and sauces as it was my first time! But lets me real, the PRICE. How can you even compare to anywhere else? My deluxe wrap was HUGE, with REAL food and it was only $6.50 + tax.    I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem. Perfect Soup, Salad and Sandwich with Artisan Bread. Definitely would recommend and come back and try a wrap. Fast & Friendly service.   Had the chilli which was packed with tons of variety of veggies with 2 slices of toasted buttered walnut bread."}
{"text":"Really loved the food sorry guys I ate it before I could take a picture I love this little place it's coming back for more. The lady that runs this place is super kinda hearted so if you're  having a down day drop by!!!"}
{"text":"I love soup and sandwiches for lunch - especially in the winter.  The pea soup was really good and my favourite sandwich so far has been the Deluxe sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was not disappointed. Soup was tasty and sandwich was good also. Nothing that will blow your mind just simple good food!"}
{"text":"This is another local favourite on Main St in Newmarket! Soup-pa features about 4-5 home-made soups each day, as well as sandwiches (and cookies!). They always have a good variety of soups each day - you can check out the list on their Instagram account. My husband loves this restaurant even more than I do. I don't get there as often as I would like but there's nothing like a bowl of soup, no matter what time of the year. The owner, Ness, is friendly and funny and always says hello or asks us how we're enjoying our lunch. He was happy to oblige when I asked if I could just have some buttered grilled/toasted bread rather than a sandwich (the soup portions are especially generous and I find it too filling if I have a sandwich alongside). My favourites include the split pea or lentil soup, potato and leek, or good old-fashioned chicken noodle. I would personally love some heartier, thick soups (like beef and barley with lots of vegetables)."}
{"text":"I think Soup du Jour means I'm supposed to have soup every day--I'm in!  I stopped in for a light lunch and the quench my curiosity. It's a tiny place with big opportunities. The \"soup board\" listed 6 different specials, including beef stew, and Chili.  The Broccoli Cheese soup caught my attention. I have been eating Broccoli Cheese soup all my life--let me clarify: I have been eating BAD broccoli cheese soup all my life. Until today, I did not know there was any better version than a bowl thickened with loads of flour, and broccoli with tough chunks.   This soup was thinner and I could taste broccoli!  Perfectly tender broccoli!  Not an overwhelming load of cheese stew!  I was tempted to get another bowl, but in a mug so I could drink it in the car.  Seinfeld can keep his \"soup nazi\", this is way better, and cheerfully served. I was given a challenge: if I didn't like the soup, I get a refund. Who needs a refund? I need more soup!  Oh, and they make fresh artisan sandwiches too, but that's for another visit..."}
{"text":"Searched for a sandwich/soup place and found this little gem. Made from scratch sandwiches, soup and salad. Good price for freshly made food! Not sure about their coffee but I noticed they have a drip coffee machine and an nespresso-type machine there.  Main Street is a nice place to be in the Newmarket area."}
