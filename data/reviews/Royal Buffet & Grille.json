{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night at 6:30 which is dinnertime in my book.  The smell when you walk in is a combo of seafood and stale air.  The \"buffet\" was weak.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was good either.  It was just meh!  I always wondered why there were never any cars in the parking lot... now I know.  Next time I get to pick where we go."}
{"text":"This is a buffet restaurant and Mongolian Bar. They also have some sushi. The food, at times, is very good. They do not replenish often and sometimes the food in the trays is cold. My husband really likes it. I don't think it is consistent. If it is crowded, they will replenish more often and the food will be fresher. They have some odd selections. What upsets me the most is their compensation of their servers. We had a very good server and we tipped her accordingly. (I don't always tip well at Chinese buffets because they usually only take your dirty dishes) This one was an exception. I found out later that they pool their tips. That's fine, but our Server did not get any of that tip because she is part time and young, so does not get a share of the tips. So, I basically tipped Management and that was not my intention. When I confronted them about this, they were not too friendly about it and she was admonished for telling me. Not sure we will ever go back. I was embarassed and I don't think what they are doing is legal?"}
{"text":"royal buffet & grille of medina, offers an all-you-can-eat lunch & dinner buffet. They specialize in american, chinese, mongolian, & japanese cuisines. It threw me off I've never see or had Mongolian good but different ,
The food is good. The dining room is very large. The service great, they swoop in and remove unwanted items quickly and efficiently,while keeping drinks filled. The place is very clean and well kept. We went for my friends baptizem celebration there was plenty of room and everyone  had a good time and a good meal!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have every had... I left a Buffett still hungry because the food quality was so poor and I didn't want anything else. The chicken tasted freezer burnt."}
{"text":"For the money, go to dragon buffet further up the strip.  The food here was not very warm but everything i ate was edible. I did not try their sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi is good - love their California Roll. Their buffet is ok, except for the salmon (it's squishy like a sponge and tasteless), and their desserts are atrocious (the store bought cakes usually taste stale).  Soups are very good and piping hot."}
{"text":"I have a feeling the 5 star reviews are fictitious.  I saw the parking lot was crowded and thought they must be doing something right.   I was wrong. Inside, there were a few patrons. Most of the food looked like it was been sitting there for quite some time.   The selection was minimal.  The service was poor. The server came by one time never took any place away. There are better selections in Medina."}
{"text":"Really nice reasonable priced Chinese buffet.  A large selection of items.  They do replenish items.  If you don't see something ask.  

Be sure to try the Mongolian style grill.  You pick your own items and they will fry it up.  It is included in the buffet.  Be sure to tip the fry chef separate when you get your dish.  The do have a selection of sushi items.  If you are looking for white rice is is on the side in rice cooker.  For dessert that have a variety of items.  It seams different each time.  

We usually find something different each time.  Go there for lunch for the best value.  Drinks are extra.  If you go there for dinner the price is higher but they add some more items.  They do have two take away sizes."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst buffet I ate at. Nothing like eating cold food right out of the buffet"}
{"text":"I could live here I swear. Amazing place. Owners are great. Food more then excellent. Highly recommend!!! May have boyfriend take me here today for Sweetest day I love it so much!!!"}
{"text":"Worst buffet ever,I actually left & wasn't even out of the parking lot when I starting getting sick in the car. I wouldn't recommend this buffet to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place was gross.  We went with a small group about 7pm and the place was near empty and I can see why.  The buffet was only about half filled and the items that were out looked like they had been sitting for awhile.  The sushi rice was hard, the noodles were burnt, and most of the food was just sitting in old butter or I'm guessing water.  It was the first time in a long time I felt like I would get sick from eating the food.  The service was slow and the tables were covered in dust.  There were also paint cans just sitting in one corner of the restaurant which I thought was strange.  If you are looking for a Chinese buffet I suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"DON'T DO IT!!!! Soooo horrible! I would give -5 stars if I could. Never left a buffet hungry before...

Came at 6:30 on a Friday. Food was dry and old. Either very bland or overly seasoned.

Dragon Buffet down the street is amazingly better. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Nope. Never again. This food tastes like straight up REGRET. Straight from GFS and probably the worst I've ever had. The only redeeming quality was the cake. The roast beef and the teriyaki chicken were ok.  Egg rolls tasted/smelled like dirty dishwater; my husband who isn't shook up by much, had to stop eating until it was off the table.  Didn't bother trying the sushi. Didn't want to risk it. 
Take a hard pass on this one. Really. Don't do it. You'll thank me.

Aaaand there was ice in the urinals.... um. Why?!"}
{"text":"Excellent food quality and wonderful service. We have been to many Chinese buffets and this is definitely the best place we have been to.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was cold and runny. The only thing that gave it 2 stars was the freshly made Mongolian grill part. At least that was hot. The ice cream had freezer burn."}
