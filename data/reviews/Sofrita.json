{"text":"We had reservations for 6 people at 7 pm on Sat night.  Only one table in the very tiny restaurant seats 6 so at 7:30 when the people using the table were still sitting around talking after they had paid the bill, our group of 6 was forced to be seated separately!  Staff apologized but didn't offer any chips or go to the table and explain to the people taking up space that we were waiting.  Service was slow, food was mediocre.  Shrimp taco came in one large breaded piece.  I thought it was fish and when I picked off the breading I found one tiny cocktail sized shrimp inside the huge blob of breading!  All 3 tacos were the same way.  One tiny shrimp and a pile of breading and very little flavor.  Huge disappointment all the way around."}
{"text":"Sofrita is a terrific environment for dining especially outdoors on the patio. Great food along with a great street scene and activity. Sofrita is also special as a locally owned and run restaurant as its owners are significant and regular contributors to the Fountain Hills community and its youth!  Steve Ryan Fountain Hills"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a peaceful and beautiful place to eat this is it. This is a locally owed restaurant in Fountain Hills that we drove past while viewing the famous fountain. My daughters are hard to please when it comes to Mexican food (they were raised on authentic Mexican food) and boy were they pleased. My two middle daughters ordered the fresh homemade tamales and even ordered seconds! My oldest ordered the crab ceviche and was amazed at how delicious it was. I chose the fish tacos and ate every bite. My youngest ordered a quesadilla (not on the menu) with sides of beans and rice. She devoured the quesadilla yet was not super impressed with the the sides. Initially I was worried I would still be hungry as these are not very large servings and sides are a la cart, yet I was full before the last bite. Although it was moderately priced, I felt it was appropriate for the area and the atmosphere provided. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a unique and charming restaraunt with wonderful food. I love their breakfast menu! Everything I have tried so far has been amazing. You can't go wrong with The French Caribbean Toast Board, the Tamale Y Huevos,  or the Tres Breakfast Tacos. They are all delicious!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants we have been to since moving to Scottsdale 7 years ago. Worth the drive to Fountain Hills. Great food, service and it's dog friendly. A restaurant trifecta."}
{"text":"Let's just say this... there is no sofrita here. The pernil was in a horrible tomato sauce with no spices. The Ropa vieja had some potato pieces and basically in the same tomato sauce as the pernil.  The rice was disgusting and more of a jasmine rather than even Mexican. The $12 guacamole was smashed avocados, tomato, seeds, queso fresco and zero flavor. We had to ask for extra lime to try and perk the taste up. The service was horrible. We had to get up to find a waitress and when we did... wow ! She was clueless.  As we tried to make the best of the beautiful night, we asked her if she had cappuccino, as discussed in other reviews. The waitress says no to us and that only black coffee was served. We asked for our check and will never return.  With a Puerto Rican husband and many years of cooking Puerto Rican food, this is not the place. I will give a star for at least portion size, if you can tolerate the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"Very satisfied!  Great food! Quiet!  Perfect!  New to Fountain Hills. This is the place we were looking for"}
{"text":"We drove to Fountain Hills to eat at a different restaurant which turned out to be closed. So we tried this place on a whim and are we ever glad we did. We started with the guacamole and chips. EXCELLENT!!!  The coconut mojito was excellent as well. For dinner we had the fish tacos - which were incredible - and my husband doesn't usually care for fish. We also had the pork pernil. Very good flavor and the pork was extremely tender. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but where's the flavor?  Drinks were ok but could have use some lime and salt in the guacamole.  My friends got salads that were dry and dressing was bland.  I ordered tamales and they were dry and flavorless.  Had to smother with salsa to be able to finish.  Too bad.  This is a great location and friendly servers.  Just need some good food.  I mean, how tough is it to make Mexican food that has some flavor."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We had their shrimp tacos, tortilla soup, El gran combo salad, and tamal con huevos.  everything we ate was amazing! Their ginger lemonade was refreshing.  But the most amazing dish was their Caramelo cake! OMG!"}
{"text":"The breakfast bruschetta board is really, really delicious. I usually get the \"Hash Mash\" and \"French Caribbean Toast\" for my board, and it's really fantastic. The French Caribbean Toast in extra delicious dipped in maple syrup, it's very sweet without being too crazy for breakfast. The Hash Mash comes with a slightly tangy lime mayo which I love. I've also had the PB&J, which was very good as well, the jam is really tasty! The breakfast bruschetta board ends up being two meals for me, it's a lot of food and worth the price. I've only eaten here once for dinner, and ended up getting a variety on the dinner bruschetta board, most of which were okay, but the BLT was excellent - like a really well made salad on bread. I prefer going for breakfast, however.  Just a side note, they change their menu during days where there is a lot going on on the avenue, so if you have a \"favorite\" meal, it's best not to go during those events. Bummed us out a few times due to that."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! We know the owner/chef personally and really enjoyed what we ordered....and we ordered a lot! I suggest starting off with a sangria, white or red, I chose red and it was perfectly sweet. My husband got the Ropa Vieja and I got the Pork Pernil which was cooked for 12 hours. Don't forget to end your perfect evening with their wonderful selection of coffee. My husband got the Cafe Cubano which was a small double shot coffee BUT I GOT THE CAFE RICO! Amaze balls, super strong coffee like I lot with rum and Kahula. Let's just say I was feeling like a million bucks after that Cafe Rico, lol. Sofrita's may be in Fountain Hills but is a short trip away from Mesa, Tempe, Scottsdale, Phoenix or Glendale. Don't miss out! OH AND IT IS PET FRIENDLY!"}
{"text":"Very unusual to see acceptable reviews about the food. We had fish tacos and shrimp tacos. My wife's fish tacos were so greasy they were barely edible. The shrimp tacos were  worse and after biting into one, noticed the lack of shrimp. I opened it, took out the should  be shrimp and found there to be a shrimp the size of a quarter enclosed in a glob of batter the size of the tortilla. ONE very dry shrimp. In the entire taco. The other 2 matched the first. Also in the tortilla was about 2 tablespoons of green cabbage and that's all. Mmmmm tasty. Really hoped for better. Maybe 2 or even 3 shrimp in each one. What a rip. Hard to think about going back when no one I pointed it out to was very concerned. That is when I could find someone to let them know. Maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"I visited Sofrita's a few Friday's ago and had a wonderful experience. They serve generous portions and savory Sangrias. We ate the Bacaladitos and the Puerco dish. Both were delicious!  We sat on the outside patio to listen to the Flamenco music and the whole ambiance was warm, cozy and the perfect date spot. The staff is friendly and hospitable. Great place...must try!"}
{"text":"Mmmm their breakfast burrito is so good ....super cute place...dog friendly patio. Friendly staff the ranchero breakfast was delicious they have vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Charming little gem in Fountain Hills.  The food is excellent. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just tried this place out and was pleasantly surprised.   There was a wide selection on the menu and could've easily tried 5 items.  I ended up with the shrimp street tacos.   The for was great and the service was even better.   Nice spot and I'll surely return."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. We love the food, the ambiance, the location right on the Avenue. Whether we take our family here, engage in a date night or I meet up with a girlfriend the food and drink do not disappoint. The guacamole, street tacos and bruschetta can't be missed however the menu is always showcasing new items to try which I love. I could eat nothing but the bacon wrapped dates for the rest of my days and the Sangria is the best I have ever had. if pineapple is offered I would highly recommend ordering. Service is always superb and you can tell these people love what they do, it shows! Thank You!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on a local TV program called \"check please\". Thought we would try it last Sat. night. Called for reservations, got the time we wanted and away we went (about 40 Miles) to Fountain Hills. Sat down, ordered drinks and chips @ 6;45. Got the drinks right away, and chips and guacamole came almost one hour later. We kept asking the server about our appetizer and she said the kitchen is slow and our order would be out soon................NOT!!! We ordered our shrimp tacos and received them 40 min. later. We talked to the owner and she said the kitchen was terribly slow and didn't know why. As the owner, she wasn't too concerned and offered us a free dessert. FLAN.... We left and will not return. Cute place and a great idea. They need some customer service skills and certainly a kitchen manager who cares about the return of a customer.  Plenty of restaurants in the Phoenix area and we will not be heading back to Fountain Hills anytime soon. We are retired and have a lot of time, but our patience will not tolerate this type of service. Sorry."}
{"text":"One of those great \"best kept secret\" kind of places.  Food is exceptional and the service was great.  Quaint with great ambiance."}
{"text":"First time at this place and what a pleasant surprise. My wife and I come out to Fountain Hills for mountain biking and I think this may become one if our go-to places to eat post ride.   Food tasted great and presentation was also nice. Much more than I expected for the price."}
{"text":"Ok...starting off with a local  beer from santana Valley. .pineapple summer blend. My BFF bird day  party...love this groove place ..coming here 4 years. ...Love...."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the perfect meal last night. Sangria, monfongitos appetizer, smoked salmon, brie & apple, BLT and fresh tomato bruschetta platter, followed up with an incredibly delicious café Rico and flan. All served up by an exceptionally professional and friendly waitress Kim."}
{"text":"We love this cute Spanish alternative food establishment! Healthy choices and delish! We have enjoyed the fish tacos, fresh guacamole & chips, hummus plate and the spaghetti squash ( big enough for two!) I've also heard they have great Margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the guacamole is out of this world!  The firehouse fish tacos are amazing and the margaritas fantastic!  You can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Relaxing place. Do not go there if you're starving because the service sucks, which is funny because the place is generally fairly empty.   Been there many times, there MIGHT be 1-2 other tables, and service feels like the place is in-the-weeds busy. Have also been there as the only table of 4, several times, and the service is still awful. I'm talking incredibly, mind-numbingly slow. It's actually quite hysterical.   I'm normally a stickler for service, but the ambiance, happy hour, and taste of food makes it a worthwhile haunt in our sparse little Hills. Just make sure you're more thirsty than hungry and that you have the patience to wait for both liquor & food."}
{"text":"Great find!  White sangria was very good.  Shared a tortilla wrap and salad.  Both were fresh, interesting and tasty.  This is a place we would come back to to try more of the interesting Spanish-inspired menu"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as it looked very quaint, cool with a great outdoor patio. Unfortunately it went downhill from there. Once we walked in we were rudely greeted by the server/hostess who obviously did not care for her job. She made it very clear we would not get good service from her tonight. We ordered the guacamole and salsa which was delivered by the same young lady who basically slammed it on the table with her pouty face and sized up our table. It's really hard to mess up salsa and guacamole, but this stuff was more like ketchup and a green smoothie! Our Tapas arrived from the same grumpy waitress bit tasted good, yet the tacos were just ok. Owners take note, if you want to keep your customers happy, I'd strongly recommend looking into your evening staff of young ladies. This place won't be open long with that service. Customer service is everything."}
{"text":"Guacamole esta mui bien. Shrimp tacos excellent flavor. Portions sufficient. Thick chips and oniony salsa but great if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Cons: 1. We were seated 10 minutes before happy-hour ended, but were not greeted by a waitress until it was too late to order. 2. I had to ask 3 times for another drink before either waitress would bring me one, and then was overcharged on my bill for an incorrect number of beers. Just because I asked 6 times for a beer, I only actually ordered 3. This does not give you permission to charge me for 6 beers. 3. None of the food came out at the same time. There was a 10-minute gap between when the first plate came out and when the last plate came out. 4. The quality of the food was poor to say the least. $7 for a salad that was no bigger than the bowl of cereal I ate this morning is unacceptable. Also, the creations found in the selection for the bruschetta board reminded me of when my 4 year-old nephew made his own lunch one day; \"Nacho cheese with sliced dates covered in crushed-up Dorito chips\"  Pros: 1. None of my party has contracted Dysentery. 2. They serve alcohol 3. I was able to beg and plead and get at least 3 drinks from the watiress. 4. I was able to spend time on the patio with my family.  Overall: Next time we will know better..."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! The drinks are out of this world- they have so many different types of Sangria- and they are amazing.  The food was fresh- and perfect for a hot day!  I highly recommend Sofrita and will return on my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have had some food that was great and some that wasn't. What I am reviewing is their cocktails, they are awesome. Bartender knows how to make a drink! Believe it or not that's seems hard to find. Also the patio is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and great food! I don't know why some people complain about the holy bathroom. I thought it was really cool and different."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Maybe not to my liking cuisine-wise, but it looked like it was carefully prepared.  My major complaint is that the water, and thus whatever drink is made with it, is bad.  Whatever is wrong with the tap water in Fountain Hills should be fixed with an in-house filter or treatment of some sort.  So the 4-5 oz of soda I paid $2.50 for was a waste.  After what I thought was her acknowledgment of the water issue, the waitress did not take it off the tab."}
{"text":"The best place in Fountain Hills for a foody to find something great to eat!  The kale salad is something delicious and healthy. The slow cooked pork and the slow cooked beef are excellent. We also had the guacamole that came with a salsa that I am certain in home made. All of these dishes were excellent."}
{"text":"Loved this place, best Sangrias!!! And the various bruschettas were so tasty.  I'll probably go back tomorrow night.  Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"First time there after all these years, small town nothing last . est. 2010 how did we miss this. Tonight we had the guacamole,  red pepper,cilantro humus,  multiple brushetta. All fresh,delicious service by Jessica wonderful. Cool lounge area next store for big parties. Can't wait to go back. Secret Gem in the hills."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Sofritas when we first moved to Fountain Hills and it became a favorite from the start.  Sofritas is not your typical Mexican restaurant.  The chef creates some unique dishes featuring ingredients not found at other restaurants.  I recommend you try Sofritas.  Rick F."}
{"text":"Horrible! This is my first time here and I ordered the Puerto Salad...let's just say I was in for a big surprise! The salad came with what's basically a bag of dried vegetables on top. Yes, they were pre-processed dried vegetable chips! The only thing I could hope was that these were purchased at Wholefoods (doubt it). The dressing was running and tasteless...I was beginning to question my taste buds...seriously! On top of that, service was slow, very slow. So if you want to have a bag of chips on top of some tasteless green leaves, come and experience this place."}
{"text":"I cannot see why anyone would give such great reviews for this restaurant. There is not much to choose from in Fountain Hills, so that might explain the raves. Notice there are no real pictures of the restaurant on their website. There is a good reason, the interior is small, dark and cold, both in temperature and decor with maybe 8 tables. The bulk of the seating is outdoors and if eating on the sidewalk is your thing, then this might be your place.  The food is okay, it's a tapas place so you expect small plates and prices to go along with it. When portions and prices are not comparable, the word pricey comes to my mind. However, they do have wonderful multigrain breads, the freshest salads and deliciously brewed coffee.  Maybe we tried it on a bad day, but I would say the service was less than spectacular. We actually had to get up and walk to the door in order to get our check.  From our experience, there is nothing here to draw us back."}
{"text":"Best food in Fountain Hills ....Check  Best entertainment in Fountain Hills....Check (Flamenco singers and dancers every first and third thursday of the month)  Best location.....Check  (you can sit on the patio, drink a sangria, and watch the Fountain)  Best service .....check (Tracy always treats us well)  not having to drive over the hill to Scottsdale......PRICELESS"}
{"text":"We always use Yelp to locate great restaurants to eat at when we are on vacation. We were not disappointed. The food was fresh and seasoned perfectly. In addition the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! The food is fresh, healthy, and flavorful, and the portions are generous. We ordered the red quinoa salad, the vegan wild mushroom street tacos, the black bean soup, and the spaghetti squash and everything was perfect. Our server Noa was so sweet, -as extremely helpful and accommodating, the patio is spacious and the decor and music is fun and lovely. Seriously delicious food and amazing service, we're so lucky we found this place!!!"}
{"text":"This small but comfortable restaurant is amazing. One of my favorite styles of cooking is Caribbean influenced Spanish food. Cuban and PR being my favorite. They really have the Puerto Rican food down! The most authentic I have had in Arizona without a doubt and on par with most east coast PR food. Great staff and a Santeria shop collocates.  Try for lunch with sangria or dinner sofritas. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had our first trip to Sofrita Saturday night. It was not crowded and mellow - just the way I like it. We had the pork pernil, ropa vieja, and some tamales. All were simple, but flavorfull. My wife cannot handle anything spicy, and these were mellow enough for her. The sangrias were a little sweeter than I like, but professionally assembled. I look forward to returning and trying some of the seafood items. Also, the restaurant décor is awesome!! Staff was attentive. No complaints."}
{"text":"So pleased with the simplicity and deliciousness of the two dishes we ordered. The guacamole appetizer with the salsa on the side was a perfect size for two, and it was so yummy paired with the sunflower seeds on top. The quinoa salad was also wonderful, light and tasty. And they were easily adapted to be vegan friendly. The interior decorations were tasteful and inviting and our server, Ally, was friendly, personable and professional. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Unique inspired tapas- elegant rustic home cooked feel!!  The hunny drove me randomly out to fountain hills one date night.  He could not recall the name of the restaurant so I was getting a little frustrated!!!!  We came in here- he finally found it!  What a yummy gem!  Pros: Zucchini Corn cob Bacon wrapped dates  Red sangria  We also had the pork pernil- very good too!   This restaurant had a great staff, helpful server who gave us space but checked in at all the right times.  This is a perfect date night or family spot.  We ate our zuchinni so quickly the first time we ordered a second plate.  The flavors of everything were so unique but balanced you didn't want to stop eating.  Next time we must get dessert!! I can only imagine!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant.  It is not Mexican food!  It is Latin inspired food.  Think Spain, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Costa Rica.  If you're wanting heat, cumin, some type of chili peppers then go out for Mexican food.  Tapas is served and should be share with family and friends.  I had their white Sangria and it was the best I've ever had.  I usually pass it up it is too sweet, for me, but this was perfect.  We had the pork and vegetable tamales and the Bacaladitos for starters.  The masa is light and not heavy as some tamales can be.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Bacaladitos.  They were light, fried and not greasy and the dipping sauce was fantastic.  For our entre we had the pork pernil and the shrimp street tacos.  I don't know how the cooked the pork but heaven entered my mouth.  The shrimp street tacos were good, but I'd choose something different.  Dessert was share and we had the Santa Marta.  The cake was moist and perfect in sweetness-- not overly sweet just perfect.  For two people for food, alcohol, and with tip it came to $80.  The inside of the restaurant is small, but the patio is huge.  If you go, do so on a cool evening and enjoy the outdoors."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day with a couple of friends.  We enjoyed the views, the service was very friendly and the prices were great.  But the MOST impressive part was the food!  SOOO yummy! And I enjoyed their creative presentation of foods by using unique dishes. And, their patio is dog friendly; complete with doggie treats and water dishes. I'm looking forward to going back. :-)"}
{"text":"My review will be short and sweet. Food was flavorful (try the Chilaqueles Verde- you will thank me later), loved the decor (especially the glittery Halloween decorations), and owners are friendly. What a treasure for Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Very creative menu.  Delicious food for the most part.  Occasionally there have been some weird waitresses in there that act like they are too good to help you, and you are an inconvenience.  I was very put off when I walked in and asked if I could order something to go and was told \"NO\"...seriously WTH? You don't want my money...alrighty then."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and son after a long day out hiking Payson. Totally cool place! Decor was fun and I also noticed they sell some items as well. Started off with red sangria and a pineapple beer both were so refreshing. Moved on to the elote and calamari. Calamari was the only thing we ate that we really could have done without. The main event was the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and chicken tacos. All done so perfectly and you can taste the freshness! Asked for some hot sauce, they had 2 different types and I would give 5 stars for that hot sauce alone!! Ally was our server and she did an awesome job. We're from Scottsdale but we're defiantly going to make the trip out to come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yah! I went to Sofrita's today for lunch. The spanish tacos were great! tasty meat lots of fresh topings, Lovely. They had live music playing on the patio. A very pleasant afternoon. Prices are very reasonable too.  I am happy to report that the problems with the buliding have been resolved.  Frequent Sofritas often Fountain Hills needs this place."}
{"text":"This place is a jem within Fountain Hills. With its lovely views of the lake when dining outside, and live music/ performance playing every so often, it makes this place such an romantic and joyous atmosphere to dine in. We loved the wonderful variety of foods that we tried being that flavors here in Fountain Hills seem to be bland and usually American, this place kicks it up a notch! Ethnic eats, and soulful atmosphere makes us want to return again and again. Service was always excellent."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Been there several times and never disappoints. Quiet with a nice view."}
{"text":"Awesome tapas! My coworkers and I met here on the evening of June 21, 2016 for cocktails and tapas. Everything was excellent and we ate a ton! My favorite was the shrimp taco. Even dessert was delicious.  Service was great. We will be going back to try the items we did not try this time and I can't wait to bring my daughter here the next time she is in town."}
{"text":"Decent place if your in Fountain Hills. The margaritas are great. The guac could use more salt and spice. But not a bad joint if your craving some simple Latin food."}
{"text":"This place has amazing bruschetta boards, you can choose 4 different kinds of toppings! Local draft! Great mixed drinks, Hummus and fried chickpeas. In their gift shop next door is a wall covered with crosses you can purchase; handmade so it's great for a local souvenir if that's what you're into!   And this is one restroom your going to want to take a selfie in ..."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Fountain Hills. Great menu, charming atmosphere, and great management!"}
{"text":"Food is somewhat good however, the staff there are wack-a-doodle to the MAX. They are literally the cast of Mean Girls 3. You can see the way they treat each other and you can hear them bickering from the tables. They have no respect for anyone but themselves. It's a really crappy environment."}
{"text":"This place is really great. I have only come here after spending some time at the dog park down the street. Why? Well by then my pup is tired and Sofrita allows dogs on the patio (not just outside the fence).  Be prepared to be on Spanish time when you dine here. The service is slow and no one is ever in a hurry. This can get annoying if you aren't expecting it. They have great sangria's, served in huge glasses with lots of fruit. The chips and salsa is really good! The chips are made fresh and so is the mild salsa. If you want it hotter you're going to have to add some hot sauce.  The tacos are quite doog and a steal at $2 a piece (less during HH I think). My favorites are the pork and potato...stay away from the chicken, dry and boring. Definitely a great place to relax, take it slow and enjoy an afternoon on the patio."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. The flavor combinations are exquisite, the owners are wonderful, and the Happy Hour specials are great. You have to try the new Hummus dishes! It's a great relaxing place to eat, drink, and hang out."}
{"text":"This is a charming little place to eat because it's small, dark and pretty busy during happy hour. Plenty of tables ordering tapas and enjoying their margaritas. My girlfriend and I chose to eat inside as it was about 110 degrees out and we didn't feel like melting outside with the other brave souls enjoying the view of the parking slots. We ordered pretty light, 2 margaritas, the Cilantro hummus, 2 orders of Shrimp Street tacos and the coconut flan for dessert.   We had a good start when the hummus came out nice, cold and spicy. I've rarely ordered a hummus appetizer anywhere where the hummus wasn't done right. It's pretty impossible to screw this up. After the hummus came out tacos and that's when it went downhill. The 3 tacos were literally minuscule and filled with 2 small sized shrimp which was overly fried/breaded and sprinkled with some kind of sauce. The fried part kind of threw us off as we both were not fans of fried shrimp. Once we both bit into our individual tacos it we knew right away that the shrimp tacos would have to be rid of their breaded covering. We both agreed that we were better off peeling off the heavy breading and mixing it up with the tortilla some salsa and then just call in the dessert.   So since we both loved flan we thought that another round of margaritas plus coconut flan should take care of our disappointment and hunger. Well it didn't turn out that way. Thank goodness we only ordered one flan because the minute we took a bite we knew that there was no saving this night. While we knew that flan was supposed to be sweet we didn't expect it to have no flavor. I mean no flavor period. We literally ate a flan with no taste. You know the Taylor Swift song \" Blank Space? ' this was \" Blank Flan.\" Neither of us could taste an ounce of coconut or enjoy the yummy light sauce that you usually can skim off the top with your spoon.  Night over.  If you're looking to have a drink in a local place with a funky ambiance this fits the bill as it's near the famous Fountain and has a nice patio. If you're hungry, buyer beware as this place isn't cheap. Dinner and drinks for two was over $65."}
{"text":"Fairly good Mexican food and a nice atmosphere (especially patio seating).  The guacamole was my favorite part, assuming the margarita doesn't count.  The tortilla soup (my lunch) was a little bland but the rest of the family liked their food a lot, and everyone wants to come back.  Overall a solid lunch experience."}
{"text":"I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that I've ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.  I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a \"roasted\" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.  The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.    While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.  Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The location is great.  Near shops and close to the fountain park.  We have visited two separate times and unfortunately, the service has been bad.  The first time it took a long time to get a server to our table and then we still had to wait longer for menus and water.  We gave it another chance and it wasn't much different.  I don't remember the name of the server, as she wasn't worth remembering.  The great servers really stand out, especially living in a small town."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of many of our Fountain Hills, locally owned and operated restaurants - but Sofrita is probably my favorite of all! Largely a tapas-based restaurant, some of the best things on the menu are the small bites that are meant to be shared with the whole table. I love its close, warm atmosphere inside, and it has the dog-friendliest patio outside. A pan of water and a cookie from Spike's Treats is delivered right away, for all furry patrons. Also, the patio is perfect for relaxing on a non-summer day, for people watching and of course, for watching the fountain blow, every hour  For breakfast, I've had the chilaquiles, the huevos rancheros, and the bruschetta board on various occasions, and they're all really good! The chilaquiles are an especial favorite with yolks cooked perfectly-oozy making it an egg-ophile's dream come true! And the bruschetta board (smoked salmon, caribbean toast, and the hash mash are my favorites) is plenty for two...or enough to bring half home for a yummy second breakfast later on  As mentioned before, my favorites for lunch and dinner are the tapas. Warm nuts, tostones, zucchini, street corn, the afternoon/evening bruschetta board (this time, my favorites are smoked salmon, brie with apples and jam, olive tapenade with goat cheese, cilantro hummus, mozzarella and red peppers)...are all super yummy! But I think my absolute favorite are the bacaladitos - served piping hot, in a paper cone, with lime mayonnaise on the side...these are the best, crunchy-on-the-outside-pillowy-&-chewy-on-the-inside salt cod fritters you'll ever have!   I've also had the salmon narania (I would kill to be able to figure out the glaze and sauce), and the pork pernil (unctuous and glorious)  And, they're constantly trying new things and changing the menu, based on seasonal availability and weather-appropriateness. I love seeing them post on facebook that they're \"experimenting\" with something new, that it's available \"now!\" - and that I'm just a two minute drive away from benefitting from the quick notice  It truly is a little gem!"}
{"text":"A trip to Phoenix and some quick Yelp searches in Fountain Hills brought my wife and I to this inconspicuous local restaurant. My wife and I love discovering hidden local gems, and I believe we hit the nail on the head with Sofrita. With its Latin American charm, excellent service and fresh food, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious modern Mexican/Latin American cuisine.  For starters, I live the ambiance of this place. It really has that local feel (reminded me of some of the local places we discovered in the Caribbean). With an open kitchen, bar, and indoor and outdoor seating, you'll feel at home the moment you step through the door. The staff let us pick any table available (inside or outside) and handed us some menus. We then started with some drinks, a white sangria for my wife (with lime, pineapple and orange) and an iced tea for the driver (me). Both drinks were very refreshing.  When it came time to order some food, we started with some chips and guacamole. The guacamole was very unique (the avocado and spices were mixed with jalapeños, tomato, green onion, lime and pipitas) but SO good, especially with the tortilla chips, which were crunchy and had the perfect amount of salt. We then moved to entrees - shrimp street tacos and pork verde tacos. Wow were these delicious! The pork verde tacos were hot, juicy and sweet/spicy (fixings included vinegar slaw, pineapple salsa, and pepitas on a double corn tortilla). The shrimp tacos were equally fresh and juicy. Homemade cuisine at its finest!  When all was said in done, we left feeling incredibly satisfied. I'd love to visit this place again and highly recommend it to others in the area!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  Mild salsa was very bland.  Too many onions in my mind.  Guacamole was bland.  Bean dip was bland.  Shredded beef tacos were pretty good.  Shrimp tacos were good. Chicken salad with lettuce cups was ok.  Fish tacos were good but sauce was bland.  If you are a Midwesterner that likes bland food, this is your place."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to do so, I have to agree with the other reviews.  The food didn't have much flavor - we had the ceviche, and bacon-wrapped dates, and the cod fritters.  The fritters were SO dense that they just landed in my stomach like a lead weight, and didn't really have much flavor - just very doughy.  The ceviche was ok I guess - but just didn't have that punch of flavor I was looking for.  Bacon-wrapped dates are always good.  I love tapas but unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"Charming place with good food, great location on the main boulevard and fast service. Excellent margaritas, fish, shrimp and salmon tacos with wonderful mango salsa and fresh guacamole. Don't miss if you're in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"This little restaurant serves the best Mexican and Tapas in the area.  Everything on the menu is fantastic and service is excellent.  Try the fish tacos (best around), the Moroccan spiced chicken tacos, the grilled salmon and the homemade guacamole is to die for.  Very intimate inside and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great small plates and super tasty food.  Nice people here too.  The margarita was a bit too sweet, otherwise a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I still love this place and it's still the best eats in Fountain Hills but the food on my last 2 visits has been so severely over-salted that we could barely eat it.  Please guys ... pay attention!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long walk around Fountain Park. All our food items were homemade and fresh. We tried 6 different plates and all were very good. Prices are reasonable.  They have a daily happy hour with $3 mini-margaritas, $2 beer and $1 tacos. Think the timing was 3-5 p.m. Will plan to go back for one of the happy hours when the weather improves.  Our server was very friendly and they have an outdoor dog-friendly patio area. Several people were there with their dogs, enjoying the afternoon. They also have another outdoor patio area for people only.  Overall, it was very enjoyable lunch and will definitely go back.  (Ate outside, but the inside seating is very limited, so could get crowded quickly in the evenings or on bad weather days.)"}
{"text":"Have been there several times for the breakfast burrito and soft tacos. Have been very pleased every time with the flavor of the food, and the home-made salsa just rocks! Well worth the visit, and the owner is very gracious, and the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if they made six stars, this place would get them ALL!  Amazing and creative food, great atmosphere, not a chain, sweet and knowledgeable waitress... Why oh why Sofrita can't you be located in Old Town???!!  This cute little place has a mom-and-pop type charm with great décor and nice outdoor seating where you can view the fountain from.  We started off with the white wine Sangria, which was de-lish and then got the bruschetta board to split.  Chicken salad- Raspberry Mayo, Dried Cranberries & Smoked Salmon with capers and egg salad... Each bruschetta was better than the next.  Then the tamales, the shrimp street tacos, the street corn elote, tostones and finally these puffy bread treats.  From reading this you might think my boyfriend and I are either obese or part of a competition food eating team, but no both in fact are not true... the food was just that good we continued to order after we had eaten each morsel.  The waitress even applauded us for being \"troopers\", which I think meant we had eaten more than the party inside of ten, but we couldn't help ourselves.    This place is a MUST if you are in the area... I cannot wait until we make the journey out of our Old Town bubble and back up to this mouth-watering resto."}
{"text":"WOW!! Really like this place. Saw Sofrita's on Check Please, channel 8. They gave it a great review and I do as well. Don't miss out on this place. Nice to have something different in Fountain Hills. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"This wonderful little place is as good as it gets!  Small, intimate, and a wonderful array of dishes to choose from... Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner!  Service is amazing and very personal.  Wait for the cool down of the weather and eat outside with music and entertainment.  Sangria is to die for!  Shrimp Street tacos a must!  Prices are great and  the staff/owner is warm and inviting.  As far as in the Valley, it may be a drive, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I visited Sofrita on Friday evening and had the most wonderful experience.  The entertainment, Flamingo Guitarists and Dancers were awesome.  The food, service and ambience were sensational!    I sampled numerous dishes from the menu and found everything to be absolutely delicious!!!!  The location is beautiful and perfect; especially when the Fountain is on!  Can't wait to return for another delicious and perfect dining experience!  If you haven't been to Sofrita yet then this is a must  for your next dining pleasure!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday with the husband.  Wow, it was fabulously fresh and delious!!!!  The Sangria was to die for, lots of fresh fruit floating on the top. YUM!  Tried 2 of the 4 different tacos and the black beans, very very good.  My husbands salad with a lime/coconut vinaigrette was sensational.  We will bring our out of town visitors here for late lunch soon!  You must try it! Very affordable pricing too!"}
{"text":"Wow what a nice find in FH. The Sangria and afternoon Tapas plate for $12 was wonderful. Visiting from Chicago and highly recommend - will be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"We came here during the Fountain Hills arts festival. They had a limited menu and were very inflexible on EVERYTHING. My husband wanted an extra shot of tequila in his margarita - NOPE \"will take too much extra time for the bartender\".  Wait what?? Sure, saving that extra 2 seconds will definitely speed things up.  Booze is your highest profit so this is definitely a poor business decision.  I ordered the mushroom tacos and asked if there were any jalapenos that I could have to spice them up. NOPE - just the lame hot sauce on the table.  Well okay then.... The tacos were brought out and the cook forgot to add any seasoning whatsoever plus the zucchini was still raw.  The vegetables were so large in this tiny \"street taco sized tortilla\" that it was most difficult to eat.  I told the waitress that I didn't care for them and to let the chef know he might want to taste what they were sending out.  She then told me \"Everyone's palate is different!\"  Wow!  The proper answer would have been, \"I'm sorry and I will let him know\". Our friends enjoyed the food they ordered.  I though the white sangria was very good. The guacamole was good although it could have used some salt and some jalapenos for flavor."}
{"text":"This was very good. We sat down and had drinks. The margarita was good but the sangria blanco was excellent. We ordered tacos. Rocket got the shrimp tacos. I ordered the chef's taco tasting. My taco were ok but the rockets shrimp tacos were awesome.  So when we return it shall be..... Sangria and shrimp tacos!!!"}
{"text":"I love to come to Sofrita in the winter and sit outside along the Ave of the Fountains. I love ordering their different varieties of sangria! Great place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and every single time it delivers top notch service and food. The location is great with downtown interaction."}
{"text":"The Huevos Rancheros were the best I've ever had!! The atmosphere is hard to beat in beautiful Fountain Hills! The service was on point and very helpful!!! If I lived closer this would be a frequent stop for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here after a hike based on the good reviews it received.  I was very disappointed.  The salsa was thick , almost mucousy.  I got food to go, and I waited for 30 minutes for chicken tacos.  The girl kept telling me it was coming right up, but it never did.  I got the food home, and it was terrible!  There was a mango salsa, and the mangos were overripe and chalky.  The chicken was just shoved in the tortilla all in one piece, and the tortillas were very thick and flavorless - just store bought.  They also forgot to include any utensils.  The patio was cute.  I would never go back.  It's not my idea of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Lunch during the Fountain Hills Arts Festival ~ they have a special menu but the prices are the same as the regular menu. Once we sat down, service was good, food was served promptly. All drinks are served in plastic cups during festival, so recommend you order a  beer in a bottle, which was cold!!   Guacamole was fresh, chips homemade. Order this!! Sandwiches great... Guantanama and Cubano!"}
{"text":"Awesome place breakfast lunch or dinner!. Great Tapas and made to order chips and salsa. Really nice people . Try the pepper infused tequila!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was yummy... Owner, waitress, the cooks in kitchen all smiled and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We wanted to eat all 3 meals there today, however we stated with breakfast. There is nothing that isn't made from scratch. The green salsa Verde amazing.   We drove 40 miles one way to enjoy our meal. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This review would go better if it weren't for two things. The most annoying first:  the table top where we were seated was sticky.   Two:  I don't know what type of place sofritas is trying to be.   We had chips and salsa to start. The chips were ok but the salsa was super bland. About the only thing I could taste was the cilantro. We asked for \"hot\" salsa and were brought a small (tiny) dish with two different salsas. The red one wasn't bad, but the green one was very strange. I asked what it was but the server didn't know. However someone said it was \"Lebanese\". Ok. Lebanese. The tomatillo salsa that came with the \"street tacos\" was the best of the bunch.   My guest had the street tacos and she said, quote: \"they all tasted the same.  Beef, chicken, pork, black been, or vegetable. All I could taste was cabbage\".  Street tacos are cabbage tacos?  Where?  Apparently, here.   I had the cubano, which was just barely ok. I'm used to cubanos with mustard and pickles. This one had sliced cucumbers. No mustard that I could tell and definitely no other condiments either. Which is unfortunate. The pork was pretty dry.  Very disappointed because it looked like it would Be wonderful when it came out. Except for the weird garnish of chopped lettuce and tomatoes. (I didn't understand why, it made the plate look weird).   All that and over thirty dollars later, we left still hungry and confused.   What kind of place is this?  Spanish, like we were told it was?  Cuban, like one of the dishes?  faux Mexican?  Lebanese?  Flavor free?  Tofuganic-gluten-free-range?  I still don't know.    I get the impression this is more of a bar than a restaurant.  Update:    Since moving to fh, I've come here a few times. There have been some new additions to the menu which I'm happy to say I really like.   For example. The tacos ropas viejas, which is sort of like a shredded beef in ranchero sauce. It's not ranchero sauce though, it's \"ropa vieja\". Which is Cuban. Anyway. It's very flavorful and the new update to this taco is that it has papas and fried matchstick onions. Flavor explosion in your mouth.   Regarding the table tops, I've not experienced the sticky situation since that one time.   I'll say, \"I like this place\". One of the better restaurants in fountain hills. Definitely unique. The menu, the decor (check out the baño!) and the \"santería sacred lounge\".  I really like the concept of that even though sometimes the owner seems to get unnecessary flack for it from uneducated \"experts\"."}
{"text":"My girlfriend Carolyn want to go here as soon as she saw it on an episode of \"Check Please\"  I arrived a bit early, and was placed in a corner table, right up against the wall. The restaurant was a bit warm, but I think that was in part to being right up against what I thought was the kitchen.  I didn't order any libations, but the ones I saw being delivered across the restaurant looked delicious.   Carolyn and I ordered the Stuffed Dates as an appetizer, and they were amazing. Sweet, and bursting with flavor. For our main courses, Carolyn ordered Pork Tacos, and I got the bruschetta board. Carolyn asked specifically if the tacos were on corn tortillas due to her gluten sensitivity, and she was assured it was. However, the waitress did not think to mention the mean was breaded. Luckily She only has a sensitivity, and not an allergy. But that being said. my bruschetta board was absolutely amazing. I choose the Smoked Salmon, with capers and egg salad, The Red pepper Hummus, The Chicken Salad with Raspberry mayo and cranberries, and Brie, apples and apricot jam. Every single bit was better then the one before. Each one I tasted and though \"I should have gotten 4 of this because there is no way the others can be as good...) Carolyn and I both cleaned our plates.   For desert, Carolyn ordered the Coconut Flan and a cappuccino , and I ordered The Santa Marta.  We spent the whole desert picking off of each others plates because they were both decedent.   We were also blown away and our bill, and how affordable the restaurant was... This restaurant packs so much flavor, for great prices.   The owner walked around, and visited each table which was very kind. The waitresses also had the most adorable aprons as their uniforms. I kept complimenting the waitress, and I'm sure she rolled her eyes because it's her work uniform,  but it was adorable.   I am already looking forward to taking my parents, and my husband to this amazing little Fountain Hills gem!   SUPPORT LOCAL RESTAURANTS!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It's quirky and has interesting ambiance. We had to order off the lunch menu as they inexplicably do not serve off the dinner menu until 5 pm and we were there early at 4pm. Place was pretty empty.  Waitress provided good service and the food arrived quickly.     Now for the taste.  I was in a party of three and we ordered three individual tamales and tostones as the starter.  The tamales were bland and dry. The tostones were ok. But could of used some ajo sauce.  I ordered a cubano sand which and the others ordered tacos..  Both were ok but do not come close to other places in Scottsdale and Mesa. All in all it's an ok place.  The homemade lemonade is great but I was expecting much more in the war of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Sangrias were too sweet but the food was absolutely amazing!!! They took the sangrias off the tab and brought us some strawberry cake. They really tried to fix everything that we were unhappy about. Would go back."}
{"text":"This is a cool local place with a great vibe. Small and cozy on the inside with outstanding food. The bacon wrapped dates were solid. The tamales (all varieties) were outstanding. The street corn elote had potential but the corn flavor was overwhelmed by spicy sofreta mayo. The pork pernil, fish tacos, and ropa vieja were all delicious, especially with the fresh corn tortillas. The only negative was the service. One waitress was trying to handle the entire dining room and the hostess was helping her out. As a result, service was slow and spotty. Despite the slow service, I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area."}
{"text":"The restaurant is styled after Spanish tapas bars, but with a diverse and creative menu with a Latin American influence.   Cute interior, plus outside patio. Fairly small, not many tables, but there was also a bar area where it looked like you could eat at the bar.   Food was quite good. The bruschetta plate was excellent.   I would definitely repeat."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience.  How do you run out of one of your signature dishes at the BEGINNING of dinner service.   I settled on a pork stew with three small tortillas and a small bowl of rice. How do I make a meal from that?  Sadly,  not an atypical FH dining experience.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Before attending an evening musical fundraiser in Fountain Hills, I decided that some happy hour bites in the area were in order and this looked like the perfect spot for that. There is a pleasant patio area but since this was a cold afternoon I chose to stay inside, as did all the other patrons at that time. The staff was busy but pleasant and I was immediately seated. I ordered four mini tacos - two vegetarian and two meat tacos, all of them good ... and inexpensive, at a dollar each for happy hour. They paired nicely with a glass of Torrontes. I also ordered elote, which I enjoyed so much that I ordered another one. The restaurant has a very relaxed and casual atmosphere and is apparently quite popular; customers kept coming in while I enjoyed happy hour on that cold blustery afternoon. Now that the weather is getting milder, I look forward to another visit, and this time I'll choose the patio area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. The guacamole grande was tasty but needed a bit more kick...maybe a jalapeño or some cilantro. Great place to just relax and enjoy a cocktail."}
{"text":"Great find!  Home made chips and salsa, fresh and fruity white sangria and fish tacos; very nice lunch."}
{"text":"With the construction project in downtown Fountain Hills coming to an end, we decieded to visit the area.  From the outside it does not look very elegant, with metal paito furniture and palm frond palapas.  We asked a couple seated outside if the food was any good.  They said yes enthusiastically and we sat down and enjoyed happy hour appetizer - avocado and tomato salad and street corn elote, followed by a dinner of grilled asparagus and pork pernil.  Pleasant service and really good flavors - not too spicy, just savory and delicious. Somebody in the kitchen knows what they are doing.   Fountain Hills has a handful of good restaurants, but so far, this one would be my favorite."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! The white sangria is phenomenal and the food is fantastic. My mom and I split the Santeria salad and it was more than enough - I have no idea how one person cute eat the entire thing. She had the Torrantes wine in a HUGE glass. Of all the places in Fountain Hills, this is the gem"}
{"text":"Very nice place in Fountain Hills. It did not disappoint.  We had the meatballs, the tamales one chicken and one pork.  I liked the pork better.  We also had the shrimp tacos, very tasty, and of course I had to have Tostones, delicious plantain slices that are fried twice, what is not to love about it.  My little boy loved them.  Service was excellent, they are very friendly."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Walked in and noticed the kitchen on the right. Kitchen looked un kept and it looked like there was raw chicken sitting on top of cooked chicken. Also looked like perishables were just sitting there on the counter instead of being stored in the fridge. Margarita was good!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it! It's far from our house in PHX but I saw it on a local TV show and had to try it. The service was very friendly. We had bruschetta and soup, salad, and tacos. I liked the black bean taco the best and the tortillas are fresh, homemade. The drinks looked fabulous but we had tea. I will go back for sangria or margaritas and bring friends. My bruschetta was divine even as leftovers! Everything was high quality and fresh, lovely tomatoes, salad greens. Very small dining area.....so make a reservation if you plan to go. Or sit outside if the weather is nice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Average food,  high cost,  have to pay for chips and salsa which is free at most restaurants.  I'd recommend a different place.  The waitress was slow and seemed to lack common sense waitress wise like refills,  etc.  Really need waitresses that know people need drink Refills and possibly other needs during dinner.  It wasn't even busy on the day we went. High prices to have to pay to constantly have to try and get the waitresses attention"}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Phoenix to find a bit of Puerto Rican food. The lunch menu was very small with very few items to choose from. When I ordered a side of Tostones ( a typical PR item) the waitress said they are out of season. WHAT? We ordered tacos with pernil and rope vieja, and I can honestly say they were the worst street tacos I have ever had. If you are looking for a small taste of Puerto Rican food, this is not the place. I know Puerto Rican foods are very time consuming and I can say this restaurant has taken the lazy Americanized route making this restaurant at the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"We stopped in after a hike for breakfast. The outdoor patio is adorable and dog friendly! They brought our pup water and a treat bag of biscuits and cookies. My husband had the chilaquiles verde and I had the huevos rancheros- both lick your plate good! Bursting with flavor! I recommend asking for a side of hot sauces- they brought a chili lime and medium warm, both great flavor enhancers. We ll be back for sure! The happy hour looks great too!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Check Please and had been super excited to try it. My mom and I went for lunch today. The Fountain Arts and Crafts Festival is going on this weekend, so it was super busy and they had an abbreviated menu. I'm willing to forgive them for that. The food honestly didn't live up to the hype. It was $10 for 3 small beef ropa vieja tacos that hardly had any meat on them to speak of-- they were mostly just cabbage-- with no sides included. Had I only ordered the tacos, I would've still been starving after eating them. I feel like they could at least include some sort of side for $10. I should've ordered a sandwich instead. My mom had the chilaquiles, which while good, were not as amazing as Check Please made them sound, and the portion looked smaller, as well. We had the papas fritas as a side, and those were actually quite good, but we came for awesome street tacos and chilaquiles, not fries. Other than the food, my biggest complaint is the bathroom. They only have one unisex stall for the entire restaurant, which is obviously problematic when it's busy like it was today. The bathroom is also extremely dark inside and looks more like a bedroom that someone has prepped for a romantic night in than a bathroom-- all that's missing is Barry White, and it's not practical at all. Maybe I will give them another chance when it's not a festival time and I can order off the full menu."}
{"text":"This is a nice little Latin American themed restaurant. It has a very homey feel, like you're visiting someone's home kitchen. The staff members were friendly and working hard. We tried the chilaquiles, tortilla soup, and shredded beef tacos. The chilaquiles were very good, especially the tender pieces of flavorful chicken and the fresh green chili sauce. The tortilla soup was hearty and had a pleasant flavor. The tortilla strips and melted queso fresco inside added a nice touch. The shredded beef was marinated in interesting flavors (something beer/alcohol-based I believe) and made for a good light taco meal. The prices were fair, with entrees coming in around $10 and individual tacos at $2 each. The soup was very good, but at $6, it feels a little overpriced. Overall, it was a good experience and a tasty meal. They even gave me a tea refill to go afterwards. I would like to visit again.  I am concerned about the service, however. While the two people there were friendly and working hard, it was a tad bit slow with only a few tables occupied. Since it appears that the only staff is a mother/daughter team, there is no way they could adequately serve this place if it were half or more filled. There were tables filled with leftovers from previous guests as we left, which is another sign that it's just too much work to keep up with when understaffed. Thus, the experience of a diner during a busier time would likely be worse than my own on this trip."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Good atmosphere. The menu looked promising but i was disappointed. The food was lack of flavor, it was bland. The service was quite slow. I don't think we will be back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great happy hour tapas. Corn salad was flavorful and delicious. Shrimp tacos are crispy and worth going back for. Margaritas are great too. It's small and cozy with good outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"Not sure where the 4 stars came from but our experience was not so great. 1. No one greeted us when we came in and after we sat down a hostess came by to inform that the wait time is approx. 10 mins. We got confused as there was not a lot of guest inside. Hostess came back with water and didnt wipe down the table - previous guess left a dirty table. Asked the hostess why there is a 10 min wait time and she said that they are short staffed. 2. Ordered 2 beers and appetizers -  beers not really chilled. Chips and salsa- not that great, tostones- were good. 3. Ordered black bean and potatoes tacos -  HA! not to exaggerate  - black beans straight from the can, some cheese, 1 breakfast potato, 1 piece of tomato and cabbage. Cabbage was just chopped and no sauce on it. No flavor and bland. We also ordered chicken and pork tacos, same thing. No flavor and no presentation.  This place looks pretty cool on the outside and seems like a nice restaurant but we will not be back. Waste of money and time.  Forgot to add one more thing -  plastic silverware just killed the overall experience!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to eat in Fountain Hills! I have never once been disappointed with the food or the staff. Service is always on point, and the food is consistently delicious. I highly recommend the seafood quinoa paella! Sooooo amazing and totally worth the $21. The drinks are always good, never cheap the alcohol or watered down.   Be sure to go!"}
{"text":"Pissed!!  I have been here before.  The food isn't real Spanish food more like average American Mexican but this time I went with arms full of heavy bags from the street fair.  They had a few tables open and no line.  No one greeted us and when someone did the waitress chimed in we had to wait 10 minutes.  There are free clean tables. They said they were busy but why do you have so much seating if you can't handle that many customers?  We wanted to do a few sangrias before we left back to Scottsdale and they wouldn't even let us sit because they were hoping for a larger party.  Bad customer service. You lost out on a very very easy high sale!!!!  We spend money and have quite a few connections in which we recommend people.   Their loss!  I will be writing about my experience to the owner.  If our employees acted like this we would be ticked!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this little restaurant!!  It never disappoints.  The vibe, food, service, and drinks are authentic.  We go every time we are in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Delicious place! Guacamole is probably the best in the valley. They also make a killer bloody mary. Staff is friendly. Ambience is inviting and warm. Only ding is that the menu on their website hasn't been updated in a while, and it's not the same as the menu in the restaurant. So if you go on their website and start craving something, call ahead to make sure it's a dish that they actually still feature."}
{"text":"Yummy tapas on the dinner menu.   Lunch had fewer choices, but the breakfast burrito was absolutely enormous and it was almost too much for two people."}
{"text":"This is a very small and very unique restaurant. The menu is Latin Inspired and some tapas items are offered. The plates we tried were large portions that could be shared and all the tables are set with extra plates for sharing.  I had the Ojitos Chinos - Basically it was a grilled chicken salad. The salad was made with crisp fresh greens, canned mandarins, LOTs of Carrots and Lots of crisp tortilla strips. The chicken on it was very tasty but slightly dry. I thought the cashews were very good they seemed real sweet but had a spicy kick at the end and the ginger dressing was good too. Overall it was a nice salad that I would order again but would ask for them to go lighter on the tortilla strips.  My husband had the Chef's Taco Tasting Platter. It was five different tacos with two salsas. I didn't taste the tacos but my husband said he couldn't taste what taco was chicken from the beef and pork and liked the vegetable tacos best. (that is very unusual for him) He also said they had too much raw cabbage in them for his taste.   I found that service was attentive and friendly.  I would give a 3.5 if I could  Worth a try when your in the area."}
{"text":"Just OK once again for Fnt Hills. Fish tacos were fine, but could barely chew the chicken tacos they were so tough and over cooked. Got the feeling they didn't really care if we were there or not. Oh well, so now we know. I wouldn't recommend driving up from PHX / Scottsdale but may be OK if you're in town already."}
{"text":"Saturday morning for breakfast, nice selection of teas, I had the desert floral sweetened with aguave nectar, and my wife had coffee which I snuck a taste of, very good BTW. Quaint atmosphere looks like I'm in my Nana's house with the decor definitely spanish feeling! Music is nice, servers are great very personable. We ordered breakfast burritos and the chillequilles verde. My baby boy was with us and they brought out some diced up fruit for him, perfect for a 9 month old. I actually was able to speak to the owner and she was very nice. She told us about upcoming events that the restaurant is having & to say the least we were very interested. We plan on returning to see how it is in the evening because it just looks like it would be Fun!"}
{"text":"Place is cute and good food. The hostess Ashley was super nice and friendly . She definitely does a lot there, hostessing , bussing tables and running food. I give her credit . All the other workers are just as friendly. I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"We had the street corn appetizer and the fried fish and salmon tacos. For cocktails we tried the coconut mojito and pineapple ginger margarita. All were good to very good. Our patio table was in traffic, under a speaker, and permanently dirty. I would have appreciated a tablecloth Or placemats. Service was friendly. It was good enough to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Nice patio. Good food, shrimp tacos were awesome. and nothing beats a dog friendly atmosphere where they bring you a bowl of water and some dog treats. the red sangria was quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"3/18/13 - sangria was too sweet! Sat on the patio and enjoyed the tapas. Definitely try the bruschetta sampler. Brie with apple and jam was favorite. Also enjoyed the roasted eggplant. The cilantro hummus was bland. Waitress should become a little more knowledgeable of menu."}
{"text":"We were at the arts and crafts festival and walked by Sofrita. We saw a chalk board sign that said Sangria Happy Hour Special and decided to stop in and check it out. We were seated. After 10 minutes the waitress finally stopped by and asked us if we wanted a drink. My girlfriend asked for the Happy Hour special and was informed that they did not do Happy Hour on the weekends. We pointed to the chalkboard and she shrugged her shoulders.   I ordered a beer and girlfriend decided not to get anything. The waitress kind of had a bad attitude and should have honored the special on their chalkboard, or consider erasing it.   I can't say anything about the food but the service could be improved on."}
{"text":"Great food. Bad service. Very cocky and unfriendly. When we walked no one greeted us although it wasn't that busy. The waitress, an older lady, was sitting down talking with another table rather than helping. Possibly the owner. We sat down at a table that was covered with dishes and still the waitress did not care to clean it up. The younger waitress came out and after a while we got our menus and water.  We ordered beef tacos, chicken  tacos and Cubana( not sure if I'm writing this right. It's a pork and ham panini). Then followed with coconut flan and the white cake. The food was great! Healthy and the price was right. However, I don't think it was worth the attitude. Our waitress was great but generally the aura was blah. Not going back."}
{"text":"AMAZING fresh food, and drinks with wonderful relaxing atmosphere. Our waitress was very helpful with recommendations and was attentive. The menu had a variety and had something for everyone at our table. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great music, delicious food,sat on the undercover patio with the rain, nice"}
{"text":"Five star for their service!  We came here last weekend for late dinner.  Server, bartender, chef, owner, and everyone we encountered was very friendly and went above and beyond for their service.  We had some mix up for the drink order, but they quickly made the drink my friend ordered and they also gave us small appetizer to apologize for the mistake they made... Honestly I don't remember, it could have been me made the mistake as what they made was what I was thinking about ordering.  They didn't have to bring complimentary appetizer but they did anyway.  We ordered per suggestion from our server. Bacon wrapped dates, Guacamole and Paella (gluten free as they substituted something). Based on my previous experience from other tapas place, I didn't think ordering 3 dishes won't be enough but we ended up taking some home. Portion size was larger than other tapas restaurant I visited in the past.  They packed leftover very nicely.  The server said they dropped the half of the bacon wrapped dates and brought the other half. You know they didn't have to disclose to us, they could have just waited to bring this later or don't say anything but they were honest and explained what happened.  Drink and food I ordered was just average for me but I really enjoyed their friendly service and honesty.  Very lovely ambiance located close to the fountain. Good place to stop by for casual lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"The food did not have much flavor at all. Unlike most Mexican food, the chips and salsa (at least the first round) were not free & the taco entrees did not come with rice and beans. The rice also lacked flavor and beans were very runny.  The food was also not very stove hot.  Likely would not return."}
{"text":"Friendly expedient service! Food took a bit long to come out but was extravagantly presented and terribly flavorful! Love the wide range of spices, although not necessarily terribly \"hot\" in spiciness. Had the jalapeño-lime (yuuuum) and roasted red pepper hummus with vegetables and pita bread, the garbanzo and spinach sopa (relish), the salmon with mashed potatoes (nix the orange sauce though, not so great...request another sauce), and the chicken quesadilla! All priced great for the bigger portion sizes! Very full and satisfied! Yea!"}
{"text":"There's gold in them thar (Fountain) Hills! Chef Anthony Redendo has blessed this quiet little town with one of the best Tapas restaurants I've ever eaten at.  I love Tapas, but usually hate the small servings and high prices.  Someone forgot to send Sofrita the memo, because the prices are small, and the portions are large.  Most importantly, its delicious!  It's not only mandatory eating if you live near Fountain Hills, its worth the trip from anywhere in the valley.  Don't even get me started on the delicious Sangrias, white and red.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food. Service was quick and friendly. I'll definitely be here more often."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here 3-4 times in the past year and every time, the meal was enjoyable. This past time, I had the Moroccan Chicken tacos and they were delicious! The service and music are always great as well."}
{"text":"Lots of gluten free options even battered fish tacos!  Noteworthy Central American Christian/Catholic decor including votive candles, crucifixes, and wrought iron accents. Black bean soup was as I remember the flavor tasted in Guatemala. Don't miss the white sangria."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents for a nice dinner. The decor is great, and we were greeted and seated promptly. We ordered quite a bit and decided to share: Bacon wrapped dates: OMG delicious Calamari: Some of the best ive had in a long time, cooked perfectly and sauces were a great compliment Tostones: ehh.. the least favorite of our order Alcapuritas: DELICIOUS!! For dinner we shared the Ropa Vieja and the Pork, the pork was good but the Ropa Vieja was beyond amazing. All in all, the staff was beyond pleasant, helpful and attentive. The atmosphere was dark, romantic- but still family appropriate and the food was delicious. I highly, highly suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"Very eligant mexican resturant across from fountain park. alittle on the pricey side, though, i would say that it is worth the extra cash for the great service your meal comes with.  5/5"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night for the Flamingo Dancing which was entertaining.    This was my first time here.  The service was slow but they had a full patio of people.  Great the ambience.  The only thing I tried on the happy hour menu were the tacos and they were amazing.  The red and white sangria on the other hand was terrible.  Tasted like watered down sugar.  Great happy hour pricing - cheap beer.  I do like how it's an animal friendly patio and will definitely be returning.    I hear their breakfast / brunch is to die for."}
{"text":"Sofrita is a great happy hour spot! We went last night as their happy hour runs 3-6p daily. We tried a lot of food - chips & salsa, potato wedges & a few street tacos. Everything we had was delicious & tasted authentic. If you're not drinking, try the ginger lemonade!   Awesome tacos, breakfast all day, adorable patio, great service, dog friendly patio...check it out!"}
{"text":"A wonderful family resturant with excellent food Specialites from Carolyn's own recipes."}
{"text":"Sofrita is a small, intimate cafe with a view of the lake and fountain. Their patio, while small, is charming with thatched cabanas and sits just across the street from a greenway.   The staff is friendly without being too familiar, and the service was quick. Our water glasses and coffee cups were refilled often.   I had the Lite Breakfast Burrito Verde. It was LARGE and filled mostly with veggies and a little cheese with salsa verde to pour on top. If I got this again, I would ask for the addition of some bacon. The tortillas are made in-house and are delicious!  My husband had the Huevos Nuevo Latino. He said it was tasty.  My favorite part of my breakfast was the fresh fruit salad. You know how normally a fresh fruit salad is mostly cantaloupe and honeydew? I'm not a fan of melon, but at Sofrita, there's none of that. Here you get fresh strawberries, oranges and Granny Smith apples, all cut into bite-sized pieces. Just what I needed after a walk around the lake on a blisteringly hot Arizona morning.  We would go back here again for breakfast, and it would be fun to try out their lunch and dinner menu as well."}
{"text":"One star is being generous after the horrid service I received. You've been warned. Food is just ok, tends to be under seasoned or over seasoned. But their attitudes are the worst. I will never be back and will never recommend this place. I was treated disrespectfully and with no hospitality, they do not put the customer first here. No one there has a clue what hospitality is, except the kind bartender. Future advice to them: When a customer does not get what they ordered and is very upset over the order; you accommodate them, and offer a refund and ask if they would like something else. You do NOT ask \"have they tried it?\" Or correct them and then argue with them! Also, this is the 21st century a website would be a good idea. One of the women there is the rudest woman I have ever interacted with, she made the whole experience horrible from start to finish."}
{"text":"An eclectic Caribbean, Central American menu.   Don't come here thinking you're going to get Mexican food that looks like every other place in America. There is some deep thought into what they offer, using fresh ingredients and a very tight menu, you will be pleasantly surprised if you're not familiar with Caribbean/Central American foods.  We have had nothing but superb service here over the years, and even during the crazy crowded art festivals. This restaurant recognizes locals, and treats them as the valuable asset that they are to restaurants in a tourist town. However, I've never seen tourists given poor service. This restaurant is one of a handful in Fountain Hills that really \"gets it\" regarding customer experience in a tourist town.  And the mixed drinks here are stellar, while the limited craft beer and wine selection includes some of the best. No complaints that they don't have 30 craft beers or 15 wines, we're more than happy with the small choice that they offer. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and generous wines by the glass! Yummy!"}
{"text":"The best Huevos Racheros ever and great tacos! Always great service, very friendly, and very good prices."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place in an attempt to escape an oncoming monsoon. It was a very happy mistake. I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and watching the storm out of the big circular window across from us. The service was quick and our waitress attentive. We started with the salsa and split an order of the shrimp tacos. The shrimp were fried in a beer batter and perfectly tender. We were recommended to try one of the desserts, which was a cinnamon chocolate cake soaked in a white cream sauce. Everything was excellent, you can always tell when the owners care. I am certainly planning on returning."}
{"text":"Wow!  What an amazing restaurant. We had a by group and had the chance to try a lot of fantastic food.  The tapas are the best.  The guacamole - as simple as that is - was better than you'll find at almost any restaurant around.  The fish tacos were fantastic.  The shrimp tacos were a different twist on the fish taco.  We will be back even though this is s long ride from home.  It's just worth it."}
{"text":"We are youngish professionals who moved to this area a year ago from Chandler. Softitas has become our go-to place for relaxing weekend lunch or afternoon drinks and tapas. Food is fantastic...always fresh, creative and delicious! And sitting on the patio with mountain and fountain views is heaven. Cuisine is Latin Fusion..reminds me of cafes in Puerto Rico.  We ALWAYS get the guacamole- the best..not your average...has pepitas, cojita cheese and comes with homemade chips..so good. Hubbie gets Modelo and fish or chicken tacos and I always get the lemon drop martini. And the coconut flan is to die for!  Friendly service and very fair pricing too..so happy we have this place in FH!!!"}
{"text":"My husband loved your Turkey BLT, as you can see. The black bean soup with bacon was enough for two. We try new menu items on each visit and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"What a gem! Wonderful food, beautiful atmosphere, and a friendly, helpful staff. Do not miss the fish tacos, bacon wrapped dates, or the flan....out of this world! I love this place. Worth a trip from Scottsdale for drinks and yummy food, as there is just no place else like it."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, great food and AMAZING servers/bartenders! every time I go there, I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy and colorful tapas restaurant in Fountain Hills, that features many delectable small bites such as bacon wrapped dates, shrimp street tacos, papas del padre (organic fried potato wedges with a mustard aoli), and mojitos pelotas (fried crispy meatballs with a green salas) as well as a dozen varieties of bruschetta.    With 4 selections from the bruschetta menu for $12, you can get a great variety that will fill your belly.  We enjoyed the  warm artichoke with queso blanco, the roasted egg plant creole with remoulade, the hearts of palm salsa verde pesto, and the Frangelica (nutella spread and crema Dulce).  This Puerto Rican inspired eatery, which is excellent for small groups and sharing, also has some heartier dishes on its menu such as the Pork Pernil or Ropa Vieja, which are a 12 hour slow cooked pork and beef pot roast.  There are breakfast and lunch menus available here as well, and they all have a very latin american flavor!  Thursdays the restaurant features live flamenco music, transforming this quaint little spot into a romantic destination to wine and dine your darling.  Aside from the diverse menu of Latin dishes, their home-made Sangria is a special treat.  Infused with seasonal fruits, you can get either white or red sangria, either one is fruity and delicious!  A local favorite in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"08/05/11  I went during happy hour. I had two mini-margaritas, which were good.  I also has the rum soaked puerco tacos. They were very good. The serving \"rack\" is a nice gimmick, but I'd prefer a normal plate.  The coconut flan was delicious.   The service was fast and friendly from beginning to end. Upon entry to the location, I could smell something very pleasant, although I could not determine the source. It was not a food type smell and was not overpowering. I'd like to know what it is, so I can use it in my house."}
{"text":"I had passed this place several times and decided to finally try it.......I recommend El Encanto!"}
{"text":"Over priced taco stand with little flair. Plastic silverware and wine is $9 a small glass in plastic. No thanks."}
{"text":"After trying 3 other places in fountain hills that were all closed, we were so happy to find Sofrita open. Just stopped in for happy hour, and was pleased with their deals. It was pretty quiet on a Monday and we didn't feel rushed at all. Food came out fast and was all really good. The bruschetta was good, with lots of options to choose from. I would definitely come back here to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We are here visiting our good friends in Fountain Hills. They raved about this place and so we decided to try it for a lunch. (Our friends came with us). We were very disappointed.   1. Service was awful! Our waitress acted like she was doing us a service to wait on us. We waited over 30 minutes to even get out drinks. She spilled two drinks on us at separate times. First time she didn't say anything and the second time she offered to get us a wet towel. Never apologized.  2. The food. We had heard how great the food was, and even with the bad service we stayed excited to eat. It wasn't good at all. Cold when it came out, and overall tasteless. Their house tomatillo salsa was overly salty and not tasteful at all. Not one of the members of our party finished their meal.   Overall we were very dissatisfied. Even our friends from fountain hills expressed their annoyance. Them, along with us, won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful! Best guacamole on the planet! Turkey sandwich is a club - wish it was just a sandwich - but is enough for 2 people, so share! Service is excellent!  Can't wait to tell my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a peaceful lunch here at sofritas. The organic kale salad was a delight. However I'd mostly likely do with out the berry vinaigrette. The atmosphere was calming just what I expected from a tapas."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to hang out and eat with friends! The food is great with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this place every time I've gone. Their happy hour is the time to go! $4 margaritas and $1 mini tacos + discounted apps. Food is always good. Service and atmosphere are fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant a short stroll from the fountain in Fountain Hills.  I visited with my hiking group for lunch on a Wednesday.  Even  though there were 28 of us, Carolyn Redondo and her crew made us feel right at home.    The menu is chock full of new & different approaches to Latino favorites (I'm pretty sure there is a strong Puerto Rican influence here).  This is an especially good stop for the vegetarians in your circle but the meat lovers won't go wanting....loved the pork tacos!  Can't wait to go back for breakfast...the Chilaquiles Verde looks awesome!  Great find!"}
{"text":"Came here for paint night and drinks and it was fantastic! We had such a great time and the drinks were great. If you come here during the day, this place also has really great tamales. Would definitely recommend.   It is a tad bit pricy though. Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Sofrita was fantastic. The boyfriend and I were enjoying a little staycation at a resort nearby and wanted something good for dinner. We were not disappointed here. It was a Saturday night, and a little later (for Fountain Hills, anyway) so we got a table no problem. So many things looked good on the menu but we decided to start with the garbanzos fritos and share the pot roast tacos and a bruschetta board.  The garbanzos came out in a bowl and there was more than enough for the two of us. Overall the servings here were pretty big. They were crispy and crunchy. We didn't know if you were supposed to eat them like chips or with a fork so we did a little of both! Regardless of eating style, I loved them so much I kinda want to figure out how to make them at home now.  Next came the pot roast tacos and the bruschetta. First the tacos. We were expecting a few little tacos - you know, meat in a tortilla? So when they brought out a big bowl of basically pot roast stew with a few tortillas on the side we were pretty surprised. But we dug in and just ate the meat and veggies as is, occasionally using the tortillas more like dipping bread. So like the garbanzos I don't know if we ate it \"right\" but it was delicious regardless.  Then there was the bruschetta. This I knew how to eat - haha! They do not skimp on toppings on these things. We got one with dates and cream cheese - loaded with dates. So good. The artichoke one was really tasty too.  It was all tasty. I honestly enjoyed everything we tried. We don't go to Fountain Hills very often (like pretty much never) but that may change now that we found Sofrita. It'd be worth the drive from the south end of town."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is terrible !!  We got our food (Tacos), but had no plates and the waitress disappeared after our first cocktail. When she came back to give us the plates, she literally dropped them off and ran to another table. She then brought the check and ask if we wanted another drink.  I would say a little late to ask after waiting for over an hour for her to return and ask. The chicken were good, but other than that I would never come back."}
{"text":"4 1/2 Stars...Hubby and I lunched at Sofrita on 3/28/12...loved it!!!! Cute outdoor patio with big umbrellas for shade. Inside did seem rather tiny though.   Had the absolutely delightful Shrimp Tacos...totally addicting (actually craving them now but we live 60 or so miles away).  Anyhow, the 3 corn tortilla tacos had one large shrimp that had a light, crispy breading with shredded cabbage and a delicious sauce...just yummy!  Almost everyone ordered the Shrimp Tacos while we were there. Hubby had the HUGE breakfast burrito...which he loved but had a hard time finishing..and he usually finishes everything. Believe me it's huge!! Margarita not very good but the Red Wine Sangria was wonderful! Light and refreshing. Chips and salsa (which you have to purchase) were really good...chips were homemade and the salsa was very fresh with just the right amount of heat for me. Had a Chocolate Whiskey cake for dessert...very rich and very chocolatey..not great but good!!   Prices are great. Had two alcoholic beverages, one iced tea, two entrees, chips and salsa and one dessert for about $45. Menu at lunch seemed rather limited but sooooooo good. Will definitely go again for dinner hoping there is more on the menu. Actually I really want the Shrimp Tacos again... :)  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the setting, dark and muggy night. Light breeze kicking up small palm fronds which danced along the sidewalk. Not sure if we felt like having something \"heavy\" so late at night (8:30p) but could entertain something light.   Female servers (didn't catch names) greeted us w/warm smiles under the semi-eclectic décor and soft lighting. SOLD!  Ordered the Lo Santo salad w/chicken and Toronja (w/Grapefruit Jarritos soda) Margarita. Mmmmm! Delicioso!! Dining partner ordered their Garbanzo/spinach soup w/bread - tasted his and blew me away!  Go and eat here. Just go."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good Latin music, but so-so food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in FH! I seriously recommend the red sangria(this is the best, and I love sangria!), the guacamole. ( it has perfect garnishes of cotija and pepitas) and the shrimp tacos. That meal is my idea of heaven."}
{"text":"Love the bruschetta boards and the shrimp tacos are excellent.  Food is always fresh.  Best margaritas!"}
{"text":"Sofritas is not a good restaurant. I have been there twice and service was lousy both times. It is in an ideal location in Fountain Hills and has a nice outside seating area. I am not fond of the grass umbrellas interfering with the sidewalk for other pedestrians however. The food is just ok. The bathrooms are dark and scary to me. Pricing is fine. The service is the overall weakness."}
{"text":"One star is generous. Cute grass umbrellas on the sidewalk but the food tastes like dried grass, too. Food and service matched. Awful."}
{"text":"We love the food at Sofrita's; one of our favorite restaurants in Fountain Hills! Prices are reasonable, service and atmosphere are awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Excited to try this place after exploring Ftn Hills. Sangria- if you like your Sangria with a whole lotta sugar you'll like this stuff. Way too sweet for me, typically red sangria isn't so sweet. Bacon Wrapped Dates- were just ok. Tamales were good. Stopped after those 2 as we were underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The sangria is the best. If you're looking for TAPAS, you've come to the right place. The food is unique and wonderful. Tried their Shrimp Taco, YUMMY. The brushetta, 4 for $12, was delicious and filling. Also the Tomales were great. Seems that all the vegetables they use are fresh. I tried their salad which came in a small bowl which looked like it wasn't enough until you start digging down and eating.  Service was excellent and polite. Which I had enough room for the coconut flan. I'll order it the next time."}
{"text":"This food was bomb. I had the chilaquiles and it was delicious.  Everything was delivered on time, the building was decorated really nice, and we got out within an hour!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent, the service was okay. Our appetizer took one hour to come out, and came out at the same time as the entrees. My mom had the fish taco and enjoyed that a ton. My friend had the bruschetta plate; one with apple and Brie, another with cranberry chicken, which were both good. She did not like the BLT bruschetta. I had the pork pernil, which was very filling. The crab ceviche could have been better- the menu said lump crab but it was shredded crab. But the waitress listened to our complaint and comped the ceviche. Our drinks were delicious; mojito  and a ginger soda."}
{"text":"Took Mom here for lunch on May 1st.  She was looking forward to it, as she had seen Sofrita's segment on Check Please! Arizona on DVR the night a few days before, while I had just seen it the previous night, although I've bookmarked to try this place for many months now, ever since I saw it advertised in the defunct Redendo's Pizzeria on FLW.  Mom ordered the Shrimp Street Tacos, which she very much enjoyed. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=XheSZOnLvhbEccywz17GsA#XheSZOnLvhbEccywz17GsA  I asked what in particular was the best part of this dish for her, and she said that the shrimp were of very good quality- big and great texture. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=mKqlv2n89udvqZ5NxN1-QQ#mKqlv2n89udvqZ5NxN1-QQ  I had the bruschetta board, choice of four, which Mom was also looking forward to trying, since it was featured on the show.  I ordered it, because it was one of the few items I could try (other than the salads) since the tacos were all encased in corn tortillas (corn allergy).  Their website mentions sandwiches, but I don't recall seeing any listed in their one-page menu...  I chose (from left to right) Cilantro hummus- awesome flavors, and one of my favorites of the four; Red pepper hummus- didn't impress me, but I've had a sensitivity to red bell peppers over the past few years, but Mom loved this one (!); Smoked salmon (with egg salad El Diablo and capers, and diced cucumbers as well, for those who are allergic to cukes)... this was another one I liked; and Chicken salad (with raspberry mayo and dried cranberries)- took me a couple of bites transitioning from the smoked salmon for me to enjoy this one.  I liked the textural differences from the soft mouth-feel of smoked salmon and egg salad to the chunky grilled chicken cubes and chewy dried cranberries.  Mom didn't care for it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=8lgYMMl2ej3wAyJJtxxk7Q#8lgYMMl2ej3wAyJJtxxk7Q  And last, but certainly not the least, was the star of the show... Postre de caramelo, or simply \"Santa Marta,\" a yellow cake, which reminded me of pineapple upside-down's yellow cake, with a layer of flan on top, toffee crumbles, and caramel and cream sauces drizzled on top.  I had the berries on the side due to an allergy (yes, it sucks to be me).  The two-sauce combo also gave the yellow cake a slight \"tres leches cake\" flavor, which I love.  This was a big hit with Mom!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sofrita-fountain-hills-2?select=wdwuhI4KDoUYz3cU1IAVoQ#wdwuhI4KDoUYz3cU1IAVoQ  3.25 stars for now, but we definitely want to go back.  Mom wasn't happy about the prices, but our server, who I later found out was the manager (chatted her up after Mom left and I paid the bill), and the kitchen were willing to work with my allergies and tried to accommodate.  I love that the area is across the water fountain!  I somehow missed the fountain on my way to the restaurant (we came in separate cars), and I was on my way home when I spotted it across the street, so I parked at the shopping complex and went for a stroll.  I want to take Mom back to Sofrita, so that she and I can have a stroll after.  That is, if I can talk her into it...  Btw, the fountain comes alive on the hour, every hour, and I was lucky to catch the show before it turned off around the 15-minute mark.  p.s.  The unisex restroom was quaintly-decorated (unlit ritual candles, wood sculptures, etc).  It's dark in there, which may have contributed to the slight urine odor I detected, possibly from little boys (and/or perhaps drunk men) missing their marks?  I didn't want to stay long enough to find out.  I meant to say something to our server on my way out, but got sidetracked talking about Redendo's former pizzeria location on FLW that was sold a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and just realized that I've neglected to Yelp. (Whoops) Super happy with this place. It's clean and the food us yummy. The ingredients appear fresh. The staff is always friendly.  I've been for lunch a few times and had Happy Hour there last night. Food never disappoints!  And the HH prices are SPECTACULAR!   Parking is plentiful  (street parking). Indoor and outdoor dining available. I don't believe I've used their restroom, but the restaurant is clean so I'll bet it is, too.  Great for a couple or a small group. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"That is a horrible experience tasting the food. I ordered Cesar Rodriguez salad and the chicken was a store-bought chicken strip that's for salad. It wasn't fresh cooked chicken. It was cold chicken. The dressing barely was there. I actually was excited to eat the salad because spicy chipotle dressing is one of my favorite dressings. It turned out an okay dressing. Cheese almost nothing in the salad. So I was extremely disappointed with it even though I finished the salad because I was starving.  My friend ordered a veggie breakfast burrito and it came out very soggy, I mean the dripping soggy type of burrito. It looked like water was filled inside the burrito until she took a bite of it. Horrible!   I don't give a crap if it was during the art festival and their goal to send out food faster. I expect them to do better than that especially when the restaurant was rated four out of five stars! I most certainly wouldn't come back even when there's no art festival going on. Giving out a store-bought cooked strip chicken is a big no-no! That lost my respect toward to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I think this may be the best restaurant in Fountain Hills.  It has a great location near the fountain with lots of outdoor seating.  The service was great and the food and drinks were amazing.  We went here for brunch on a Sunday, and everything was delicious.  I would particularly recommend the guacamole and the huevos rancheros.  We also got a variety of drinks, including the margaritas and bloody Maria's.  All were made so well.  Some of the drinks are kind of pricey, but they are enormous so it is worth it.  I am jealous that I don't live in the area and so I can't come back more often!"}
{"text":"We frequently stop in for Sunday brunch. We've never been disappointed in the food, and the service has improved substantially as the restaurant has matured. Nice variety and good wines, too. One of Fountain Hills best."}
{"text":"I saw the menu on yelp and really wanted the old San Juan tacos. I got to the location and they changed their menu last weekend. What are the odd. I had to purchase the full meal which isn't ideal for a single person.  It wasn't made how I am used to receiving the same plate elsewhere. Usually it's pulled apart.   This dish was swimming in flavorful sauce with a handful of potatoes and carrots. Unfortunately the veggies weren't cooked all the way through but it was still good. It came with 4 corn tortillas as well. I couldn't really use them because the meat and sauce was so piping hot lol.   Now for dessert, the sugar free lemon cheesecake is amazing. It doesn't even taste sugar free. It's a must to order this dessert."}
{"text":"Tasteless this visit for the lunch menu. Had to soak the tacos with sour cream, salsa, salt, and pepper. They were still lacking taste. Hopefully it was just the cook. Won't consider coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We often meet our real estate clients here for lunch. The consistently serve up  tasty, fresh, healthy delicious food. It's Scottsdale Home-Store'a favorite place to introduce to clients that are new to our area! (My favorite is their chicken quinoa salad)."}
{"text":"I don't want to spend a whole lot of time reviewing this place. It could be nice because of the location, vibe and drinks but the food is mediocre. The service is also slow and I feel like they should invest in full sized tables for the patio and misters."}
{"text":"Dog friendly and sunny patio!! Who knew? And they bring H2O and treats for them too! They also serve bfast on the lunch menu!  Too much zucchini in the lite blast burrito but oh well."}
{"text":"I of course checked out Yelp to see what's good in the area since I've never been to Fountain Hills. I love tapas so I was thrilled to find this restaurant. The restaurant is really sweet and cozy. The hubs and I came here for lunch and it was pretty quiet. The menu changed a little from what was shown on their website. There were a couple things I was looking forward to trying and they didn't have on the new menu. Break down on what we had and my thoughts: Spiritual ginger soda -good and refreshing Papas Fritas - good but I've had better  Street corn - eh  Chicken tacos - portions bigger than expected and just ok Bruschetta-     Date Nut- unique & i liked  it    PB&J- good    Cilantro jalapeno hummus- good but spicy    Avocado with bean salsa- least favorite  Overall, ambience great, service good and food was just ok. I felt the street corn and chicken tacos were lacking flavor. Maybe there are better dishes that we didn't try?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Super fun atmosphere and great food. The fish and shrimp tacos are to die for. Fresh, crisp, and full of vibrant flavor. Sit at the bar and hope that Felix is there. Felix has great customer service and is a lot of fun! Even the bathroom makes you feel like you've been transported to another country and is very clean. We drive an hour just to get their tacos. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best Puerto Rican cuisine this side of San Juan!  Without a doubt, the VERY BEST sangria ever!  I had their winter sangria infused with fresh blueberries, cranberries and raspberries.  For tapas, we had tostones, bacaladitos, bacon wrapped dates and the el cran combo salad.  Know that Puerto Rican cuisine is NOT Mexican food.  It is not spicy, rather it is very flavorful.  My next visit, I am eager to try the ropa vieja and the habichuleas, not to mention the macarron con queso!  Sofrita is also open for breakfast and I would be most curious to give that a try some morning."}
{"text":"We've lived in Fountain Hills for almost two years and finally tried out Sofrira. We got a table on the patio on s beautiful evening and had drinks and some of their \"Happy Hour\" tapas. Service was good, the food and drinks very good as well. This is a place worth a visit. We will return."}
{"text":"Ally was our server, after complimenting  the decorated wall of various cross hangings; she informed me they were for sale. For starters my friend Tommy and I had chips and salsa I ordered the smoked salmon tacos, not sure what he ordered (whatever it was, he seemed to enjoy it) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting great Latin American food and excellent service."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMMMM. Great sangria and have the bruschetta sampler to share. Hummus one is my favorite. Per other reviews I had the shrimp tacos and they lived up to the reputation. They are great. Finished everything off with coconut flan and another sangria"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. My husband and I decided to stop in and check it out, and we felt it was average food at best that was extremely overpriced! We came in during the arts festival, spent a ton of money for 2 things to eat and got little for it. Disappointing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Please note comment from business owner at the end of this review.  My lunch at Sofrita was indeed during the Great Fair.    From the outside, and even when you first walk into Sofrita, it looks like a pleasant neighborhood restaurant, but that is a disguise.  Except for assigning tables and having a live waitstaff, Sofrita is a snack bar with a slightly enhanced menu.  If I reviewed Sofrita as a restaurant, it would get two stars, and even as a snack bar, only three.  Why?  Things start out well.  You are politely shown to a table, most of which are outside and have a decent view of trees, a street and the pedestrian mall.  Then you are brought a faintly Latin menu, featuring six salads, three breakfast choices, a smattering of sandwiches (like a veggie wrap and a BLT), and a very small choice of beer and wine.  But then you notice that the tables are so close together that the large dogs they seat (with their owners) at the next table are surely going to be eating with you too.  Not good. If you want to allow dogs in your eatery, they should have a place that does not involve their begging for food at neighboring tables.  (I like dogs, but not while I'm dining).  And where are the restrooms?  Sorry, Sofrita doesn't have any.  When the food comes, you notice that you are given paper napkins -- also paper plates and cups and plastic utensils.  The side \"salad\" to your sandwich comes in a tiny plastic cup (about one mouthful) and consists of canned corn, canned beans, and some kind of dressing.  Your sandwiches are okay but nothing special, so the one chance Sofrita had to rescue itself with outstanding fare goes bye-bye.  Three stars because it was a beautiful day to eat outside, and you should consider yourself lucky Sofrita."}
{"text":"Menu is creative. Waitress brought out wrong beverage orders. Cold chicken was put on hot dish, which brought food temp way down. Chicken tacos were tough & dry. When my friend ordered. 2nd beer, she brought me one. I had asked for more water.  Again inattentive service. Owner comped meal we didn't eat."}
{"text":"Not wowed. We started with bruschetta board. BLT- lettuce, tomato and a few pieces of bacon, clunky to eat, nothing special. Chicken salad- I think I have bought this at Costco. Hubby liked both hummus. We had full orders of the fish, shrimp and pork tacos. There was one deep fried shrimp  for each taco, skimpy. Not enough meat on the pork tacos. I really liked the fish tacos. We also ordered a beef tamale. Disappointing, not enough meat or spice. The Santa Marta dessert was very good. The flower tea was great. I wish we would of been there after 3, the happy hour menu you looked way better then the lunch menu we had to order from. The stuff we saw delivered to other tables looked awesome."}
{"text":"Tried this place multiple times.  Many different items.  The only thing Worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service."}
{"text":"Husband and I were walking around Fountain Hills and stopped in Sofrita. We weren't quite in the mood for Spanish style tapas, but still got an app and a few drinks. We enjoyed what we got and figured we'd come back.  Our bill was $22.88 and he left a $4.50 tip- total of $27.38. A week later he noticed we were charged $38.88. He called the restaurant several times and after finally talking to the manager, she said she would investigate what happened. She did confirm that the tip mysteriously got changed to $16.00 and claimed this was the first time this has ever happened. He asked to be informed if she discovered that their receipt was altered....but never found out. He did get a refund, so Sofrita earns \"1 star\" for that. I would highly recommend holding on to your receipts until charges clear your account. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"An independent, locally owned little gem! So cute inside plus a great dog friendly patio outside. Service was outstanding, very friendly and attentive. Food was yum, the elote was the standout. We need to support little places like this to ensure Phoenix doesn't become the chain restaurant capital of the world!"}
{"text":"Just finished a work lunch here and it was a very pleasant experience. The staff was friendly, the building was clean, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to Sofrita on a lunch date with my husband.  I was so happy to see they had so many GF options.  I go the fish tacos and I have to say it was the best fried fish I ever had,it was not over cooked or greasy, even the next day it was delicious.   The guacamole was also delicious.  The cocktails were great I had a pineapple ginger margarita and my husband had a blueberry mojito.  The staff was friendly and welcoming.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great Tapas bar in Fountain Hills! Went on a Yelp search and Sofrita was spot on with the reviews. The restaurant is small in size, but it may have seemed a little smaller with the live entertainment. BTW the spanish guitar and singer were amazing. I don't mean to knock Fountain Hills at all, but we were pleasantly surprised to have great entertainment like that there. The food was inhaled!!! Bruschetta was absolutely delicious. If you go there make sure you order it. We also had the Macaroni Cheese which was excellent and we called it. Crumbled Cheese Its on top. Yum. If you are looking for a getaway from the valley, head up to Fountain Hills and visit Sofrita. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We visited Sofrita last night and and had a really great dinner. Ally the waitress was exceptional as well as the rest of the staff.  Guacamole: Not for the guacamole purist but very good. There isn't much heat here but they add some textures and rough chopped tomato which are nice.  Pork Tamales: Nice texture. Didn't crumble. Pork was slightly dry which I found off for a tamale.  The Pork Pernil was just OKAY. The pork was cooked perfectly but it isn't hard to slow roast or braise a pork shoulder. There could have been a little more depth of flavor to the whole dish though. The side of yellow rice was perfect as were the flour tortillas. With the addition of their two side \"hot sauces\", it gets a little better.  The guys I ate with had the tacos and both said they were amazing.  Margaritas were meh. Tasted like a premade mix and not from scratch. They didn't match the level of the food by any means. Apparently they are known for  their sangrias. Should have trusted Yelpers and gone that route. From where we sat, the \"bartender\" seemed nice but wasn't  exactly enthusiastic about her job and that came though.   Overall, I really liked the place and it had a lot to do with the quality of the food and friendly servers.    Doesn't seem like a great place for groups but I would go back if in the area to try some more of the menu and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is ok, I tried the pork.  Carding for alcohol is on the paranoid side.  Tiny indoors.  I doubt I'll be back.  Overrated in my opinion."}
{"text":"Summary:  Food was tasty, but very small portions.  Service was quick, but not particularly friendly.  Patio was nice, but inside was way too dark.   Poor value overall.  Four of us went for dinner, me, my wife, our 17 year old and our 8 year old.  The paella looked appealing (although I'm was a little hesitant when I saw Quinoa in place of yellow rice - and I was right).  I asked if it was enough for two to share.  The waitress said it would be.  It wasn't.  The portion was clearly for only one person.  My son ordered the shrimp tacos.  They came three to an order, but were incredibly small.  Smaller than standard street tacos.  We asked for a single taco for my 8 year old, and it took three requests before they would make her a pork taco.  The bright spot was the spicy hummus appetizer made with jalapeno for a nice bite.  It was very fresh served with pita and thick cut chunks of cucumber.   Also:  Definitely not a place for kids.  They were not accomodating regarding the menu, and the atmosphere was not for little ones.  They did apparently have a special liking for dogs as the patio was full of dogs.  The drink menu looked good.  We both had beer, so we didn't sample the sangria, which is apparently their specialty.  Overall, I was not impressed.  I don't think I would return, but if I did, I would stick with the appetizers (tapas) and sample more from the bar."}
{"text":"Establishment was moderately clean and cared for. Nothing to be concerned about. Food was inexpensive for brunch and food came quick and servings were large. ...for the most part the food was thought to be lacking spices.  My issue was....I ordered two items for brunch, a small taco and a nice side.  Only when the food was placed on the table was I told that half my order was unavailable. Had I been informed earlier, I would have changed my order completely....even then...the Server never returned to table to see if I wanted to order a replacement item.   Manager offers a couple of \"free app with dinner\" cards...."}
{"text":"The Mayan Red Quinoa Salad is my favorite!!  Cilantro, avocado, spinach, pepitas, mint, etc!!"}
{"text":"We got back from a long bike ride and I was starving! I yelped a few places in fountain hills and found Sofrita. I wasn't disappointed. I started with the lemon-limeade cucumber drink. Yum. For food, I had 2 of the dollar tacos (1 veggie, 1 carnitas), the Elote, and a queso dip thingy. I love tapas and these dishes were very satisfying. Exactly what I was looking for. I finished with the cafe Cubano and the strawberry, toffee, Leche desert. Everything was super yummy. The restaurant is small, and the atmosphere was boisterous, and it was perfect. I will definitely be back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"This place is sensational. Went her about 7-8 times in our 10 day stay in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills. Just couldn't get enough. Food and variety of is great, terrific decor and friendly service. A restaurant that really has it all together. Red Sangria best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! They always deliver great service and amazing food! I have corn allergies and they made special chips!! The atmosphere is great! They change up their menu often, so I always to back to see what new offerings they have! The fish tacos and the shrimp appetizer are to die for!! This is one of my favorite restaurants in FH!"}
{"text":"Sorry, to say our meal was not tasty at all and our tamale was cold. Maybe they can improve as we need more types and styles of food in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Fountain Hills for lunch and dinner! The restaurant is tastefully decorated with a Puerto Rican/Spanish flair. The staff and owner are super friendly. The food is out of this world. My favorites are the Firehouse Fish Tacos and the Mayan Quinoa Salad. They are perfect options for gluten-free meals, but there are a variety of other gluten-free options clearly marked on the menu, too. BEST RESTAURANT IN TOWN!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here this evening for our first visit to the restaurant. My fiancé is Puerto Rican and it has not been easy finding something that reminded her of home. This place hit the nail on the head! Chips and guacamole were exceptional. We each had a pork and beef entree, both were absolutely amazing! We cannot wait to return. Service was top notch and all staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Their menu is interesting. If you want to try something different- go here. I got the hummus appetizer as my meal (that was the only thing on the menu I thought I would like) and it was good- jalapeño hummus was the best! The skinny margarita was also good. But other items on the menu were weird, definitely not a Mexican restaurant like some people say- it's more Puerto Rican/American meats healthy alternatives. They have a lot of options for bruschetta which was nice- none of which I was interested in. The people I went with really enjoyed it. We sat outside at night and it was nice. Not giving full stars because I wasn't a fan of their menu. The service was also good."}
{"text":"Had tacos they were micro and super exspensive too bad because it was good.  I just doubt ill go back."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but my service was RIDICULOUS!   I seen 3 couples leave as they were not seated and ignored by the employees, along with them I was about to leave until I said something to the server, who gladly told me I could sit where ever and he'd be right on over...well that was not true I sat there for 10 mins and had to go get him myself from the bar area where it seemed all the employees where conversing and having a great time, I know that owners would not approve I've been to Sofritas when they are around and its totally opposite.  The food was good and tasty,"}
{"text":"I just moved to Fountain Hills. I've  been here a handful of times and  So far everything has been delicious. The Guacamole and chips are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is clean.  Staff is friendly ...  And most importantly the food is simple and DELICIOUS. Our server Ashlie is one of the nicest server we ever had. Thanks to you- Ashlie!!!"}
{"text":"A homerun, the tapas are a great size for sharing (as well as trying as many different items as possible).  I can't really comment on the sangria because I am not a great fan, however, the prickly pear margaritas were outstanding!  I think I have seen Carolyn harvesting fruit for these.  The atmosphere is fun, just remember that it is a small place, so during high season you will probably have a longer wait.  The food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went here the other night and I ordered the chopped salad, the pimientos, and some red sangria.   The pimientos, which are cooked peppers, were SOOOOO good! There were a few spicy peppers in there, which made this appetizer flavorful.   The chopped salad was the usual deliciousness. I got it without cheese and with the lime dressing instead of the creamy chipotle dressing they put on it. In the past I have had it with the chipotle dressing and it's reallllllly good.  The red sangria was good, a little sweet, but the fruit was plentiful and it was refreshing. I like sweet though, so it's all good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this restaurant. It was new, and delicious.   For two people + dessert, the bill was ~$48."}
{"text":"Website exaggerates the atmosphere and location. The website video makes this sound like it will be a special dining experience and itjust isn't..   Food was somewhat bland and average. Not a great value ($75 for two) and the owner who was bright and cheery in the website video was anything but... Maybe she was having a bad day.  Go to Scottsdale.  PS The website also gives the impression that the restaurant has a waterfront view of the fountain, but the fountain is actually a few blocks away. :-("}
{"text":"We stopped in on Sunday afternoon for a couple of drinks and had the street tacos. It was very very slow. The drinks were good, but the service was strange...and the moscow mule cup had a security tag on it. Definitely took away from the vibe. Kind of sad they had to do this. Also tried a hibiscus tea vodka drink that was interesting. We did not like the sangria sample at all. It was syrupy sweet and tasted watered down. Prices are kind of high for what you get, but they use good quality liquor. The food was disappointing. We ordered the tacos and couldn't really tell what was what for the meat. Because of the decor and lack of choices for dining in Fountain Hills, I definitely will try it again and the attached lounge. The restaurant and restrooms are clean and really super cool. I'll update if it improves..."}
{"text":"Great little local eatery!  Awesome ambiance, staff, some of the best cocktails around, and of course yummy food. This is not your average boring Fountain Hills bland menu. Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times. The food is very fresh, and the cozy restaurant is clean and inviting. Everything on their dinner menu is Tapas except for the Puerto Rican pot roast dish which we have yet to try. The Bruschetta is outstanding because the bread is so delicious. The first time we were here they had a great scallop ceviche but it is currently not offered. I would suggest the potato wedges with mustard aioli. Lightly crispy on the outside and tender as well. The bacon wrapped dates are to die for. The best part about Sofrita are the sangrias.I have traveled all over Spain and never encountered Sangria as good as they have at Sofrita. My favorite is the berry...GET SOME!"}
{"text":"Sofrita is a great little restaurant with a very unique Boricua/Nueva York sort of ambiance. There's outside seating available under umbrellas, besides the inside seating.  I've tried a few of their dishes and all have been tasty. I hope Sofrita can expand the menu a bit beyond tapas (love to see pasteles added). They could seriously rock with an expanded menu, I think! I recommend Sofrita to all, for Puerto-Rican inspired food that doesn't follow rigid culinary rules. Tea Lovers: Their selections are awesome!"}
{"text":"Needed a recommendation for a place for lunch.  Was sent to Sofrita.  What a delightful and intimate restaurant.  Loved the décor.  I would characterize it as Latin Fusion influence.  I asked what the best thing was on the menu and was told the shrimp tacos.  So that's what I ordered.  Wow!  Delicious.  There is an outdoor patio where you can view the large fountain as well.  Awesome place."}
{"text":"The worst Cuban sandwich I ever had, I am Cuban so I know what they taste like. Service was like they were doing me a favor for allowing me to have lunch.  They should also provide more lighting in the co-ed restroom. And definitely take the religious figures out of the restroom, I felt insulted by it."}
{"text":"Very impressed! At first we were a little skeptical but sooo glad we decided to try it out! The happy hour is the best deals around! $1 taco of the day, $4 margarita, $3 chip and salsa! For a filling meal for two we spent $30 with booze! The potatoes are awesome! Margaritas made with fresh lime juice. Service was spectacular! Def will come back again!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Latin cuisine! Normally, it's quite difficult to find good Latin American food anywhere, especially if you're a vegetarian in Fountain Hills! Sofritas is quickly becoming my favorite proximity based restaurant, I've always been a big supporter of local businesses, and this place is definitely in my top five places to dine in FH. Staff are always very accommodating, the Guacamole and Hummus dishes are DELICIOUS! Food comes out very quickly as well, and the beautiful rustic crosses on the wall add to a wonderful Latin atmosphere. The place is beautifully kept and always very clean, 10/10, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service. A load of vegan items on the menu if that is your slant. A beautiful short drive from Scottsdale near the fountain. That's a \"two-fer.\""}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going back. Now I am not so sure I want to ever go back. Website and the sign on the door posted hours they should have been open last Sunday. Gate was open, door was locked. Another couple pulled up just as we were leaving, so that was four people inconvienced by this restaurant in the 10 minutes or so we were there. And Fountain Hills businesses wonder why we locals drive to Scottsdale?  Because there is something authentic about being open when you advertise you are open!"}
