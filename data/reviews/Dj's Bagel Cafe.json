{"text":"I am a morning person. I hate going to the gym on Friday mornings. The only good thing that I get out of it is going to DJ's when I am done. It's always clean and even though it's always busy, the line moves really quickly. I actually wish it would move a little slower so I can look at everything they have, but the best so far is a turkey bagle on 7 grain and of course toasted. The girls who work there are all young, but always have quick answers to all of my questions. I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this to place to pick up my friend. I was waiting for my friend to finish, so i was just standing by the opened back door. I noticed that the people running this place leave their raw bacon out, on the racks, NOT refridgerated! I was so disgusted I'll never go near this place again."}
{"text":"DJ's bagels are the best bagels ever, thank you for moving west. Some poeple can't tell the differance between a store bought bagel and bagel's made fresh daily at a bakery or cafe but those of us from the big city can.. Fountain Hills is lucky to have such a friendly family owened business. The staff is always friendly and fast. There are plently of tables to either eat in or take it on the run. Thank goodness that I know that many others feel the same way because DJ's bagels has been in business for over a decade. definantly the best food and service around.."}
{"text":"Been to DJs a gazillion times. Always friendly staff...My. Favorite is the tuna on a bagel. Would give 5 stars but the last few times I stopped in to pick up a dozen bagels,  they were inconsistent in size and shape, and were on the hard side.  Their cream cheese is always good, especially the cinnamon raisin. Every once in a while I treat myself to a homemade cannot."}
{"text":"Why one star...ok I'll get to that with the last sentence.  First off  you logically would go here for food..so let's discuss that ...i was on my way to the dredded dmv and thought that perhaps I could bring something nice to eat to help with pain of it all....my first time here and first impressions were great ..you can tell right away they take great care as to cleanliness and food quality ..i knew that whatever I ordered would be good..great even!  I went for the lox and cheese...a pretty solid choice and one without much creativity as I wasn't really in the mood to go risqu√© at the time.  Got it to go ...I've read every review and so I can compare a bit..portions are very large ..too large in this case as the counter girl explained that each half of the bagel gets 1/4 lb of lox.   I inquired about the possibility then of a half bagel..they don't do that so if you are with someone just order one lox and cheese..you won't be dissapointed.   Nothing is perfect so let me tell you what could have been improved on a bit....the onions could have been shaved thin instead of sliced ...the bagel was i think from yesterday since I got it at 1215 pm theirs no way it could have gotten that stale by then ...not bad but could be better ..so let me tell you the story..walked in..lox and cheese is not on the board so I asked if they had it and how much they said yes and 10.60 or something like that ..that threw me back for just a second as all the advertised bagels ranged from 5 to 7 bucks ...that's when she told me about the 1/4 lb lox per side thing ..she assured me it was the way to go  and im one to always listen to the advice of an employee...they brought me my order bagged and ready to go very quickly .....and just as i was just finishing a text message and getting ready to leave, a visually somewhat unrefined, and unkempt charachter... obviously a cook,   approached me and began a loud enough for all to hear one sided conversation as to how they have the cheapest lox in the area and that it's 26 dollars a lb......i guess that I could have been instantly embarrassed as to have not checked the going rate of lox on the stock exchange this morning but was more surprised at the sheer audible volume of the one sided argument being laid out before me ..one that suddenly, involuntarily, included all the patrons quietly eating lunch there ...i was quite embarrassed and just said yes to whatever he was saying and left as soon as he was done scolding me .....some of the reviews say bad things about the staff.  I would disagree.  All the staff i found to be quite pleasant and very helpful and nice..big smiles ...but their is always one apple right ....the mid 40 year old gentleman cook was it ...which left a very bad taste in my mouth when I left ..and I hadn't even had a bite."}
{"text":"The huge sandwichs are good for lunch, but don't miss out on their breakfast omelets. Its a great place to people watch on Saturday mornings. I have honestly never had their bagels, because I am too in love with their egg creations."}
{"text":"Best bagel I have had since I was in NY. The
Help is fast and friendly, and the sundried tomato bagel are the best I have had."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of this place. Today was my last visit. I walked in and asked for a bagel with white fish salad . To my amaze they were going to charge me$10.88. When I asked how did this price come about as their bagels and cream cheese are around 2.99, they were totally dismissive of my concern, didn't have an excuse, and moved on to the next costumer. Outrageous price and terrible service"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!! The food is always fresh and tastes fantastic!! The portions are ridiculous (and I mean that in a good way)!! Top quality (Boar's Head products) at a great price!! The staff is awesome too!! This has become one of our favorite places for breakfast, lunch or dinner!!"}
{"text":"For years this has been our go to breakfast spot in the hills. The bagels are fresh, authentic,and the variety is plenty! They carry Boars Head meats and the lunch offerings come with hefty portions made with all fresh ingredients. Service is quick and timely and the employees are super friendly. It's easy to see why this place has become such a staple in our community!"}
{"text":"Love their pastries but the sandwiches are amazing as well
Big portions at reasonable prices
Also bagels are good"}
{"text":"They need homemade frosting for the Cinnabon not icing otherwise it would of be amazing. I wouldn't recommend any of the wraps I ordered two and they weren't good at all.  I ordered a strawberry bagel for my daughter with cream cheese and she liked it.  The sandwiches looked great.  The bacon was really good, but the scrambled eggs were not. The staff was helpful.  Spent $35 and didn't like it."}
{"text":"THE BEST & most consistent food in The Hills.  

Fountain Hills needs diverse dining options. Most places miss the mark by quite a bit. DJs Bagel is our regular haunt. The portions are big, tasty, plenty of options, and most importantly - consistent. 

I can go here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and know that I will eat well, affordably, and not be aggravated by poor service or the unknown factor. 

In a small town filled with some horrible food choices, DJs shines. A must."}
{"text":"Taylor ham, egg and cheese on an everything bagle toasted followed by 18 holes at desert canyon.... Amazing"}
{"text":"great food but very bad stuff,  the lady who took my order was rude and she didn't took my order right, this is my second time ordering with the same girl and for second time don't take the order right and giving sarcastic attitude I guess she is kind of new, I should know her name so the owner talk to her because is giving bad attitude to customers"}
{"text":"Not only is Dj's the best bagel shop in Arizona it has a convenient location and a wide variety of bagels for every taste bud range. They have every type of bagel from plain to blueberry! Great cafe check it out!"}
{"text":"Staff is very rude. The girl that took our order was very stern with my girlfriend, and I asked for a plain bagel untoasted and i got a toasted bagel. Also as my girlfriend was walking outside to save us a table and I was getting the food, one of the staff members made her open the door herself (she is also on crutches). Overall the worst staff I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Fantastic service!  I wanted a custom omelet with items not on their list due to my diet.  Not only did they deliver in spades but they were upbeat and happy to serve, making me feel they were happy to have the business and not at all put out by my requests for extra butter on top of the omelet, no bread, etc.  I returned the next day and it was very busy, yet I was served quickly and once again with very friendly service."}
{"text":"I love this place, every time I'm in Az I always have to visit this place. They have the best bagels that are so fresh and perfect and the sandwiches are huge for a reasonable price. I am never disappointed after eating here and the staff are great and friendly. I only wish I could get bagels like this in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I was late for golf this morning, so I wasn't able to grab anything for breakfast.  Heading to We-Ko-Pa I was going through the culinary desert of Fountain Hills, so I thought I would look for a breakfast place.  A church had just let out (yes, on a Wednesday morning) , so I decided that I would follow the church members.  It was a good idea, and a bad idea. 

The good part was that they led me to DJ Bagels.  The bad part was that with all the church members, it was crowded.  It was mostly an older crowd, so being old, but fast, I darted to the front of the line and ordered their special breakfast sandwich, which was the first thing on their blackboard.  And was it ever good!!  It had bacon, ham, egg, sausage, your choice of cheese, and your choice of bagel.  All for $4.99.  What a great breakfast sandwich.

As I waited for the sandwich, I took some time to look at their full menu, and watch the servers take the orders to the customers.  The service was great - and the servers seemed to know a lot of their customers.  And even with the crowd, they always seemed to match up the order with the right person.  And their menu was enticing, a lot of natural choices, and really interesting combinations.

From now on, when I golf in Fountain Hills, I know where to go for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"We all love a name, something we remember, something we assume is still great. Don't be fooled here. DJ's used to be very good, yes. Better than that, even. Now? Bottom three worst bagel joints in the Valley. Not sure exactly when things starting going south - maybe approaching a year ago. Quick issues, and quick positives:

NEGATIVE: MUST EVERY GUY BEHIND THE COUNTER IN THE BACK STARE AT MY WIFE LIKE THEY JUST GOT OUT OF THE JOINT AFTER 20 YEARS???  C'mon, guys, have a little bit of respect.

NEGATIVE: Like the comedian Bill Burr said, \"I just gave you 100% of the money to make 100% of the sandwich!\" Can someone please explain to me when I ask for ketchup on my sandwich the lady / gentleman behind the counter says, \"We don't put the ketchup on. You do. It's over there.\" NOOOOO!!! Put it on.

NEGATIVE: I want my eggs done a certain way. What really happens? You get the eggs how we feel like making them. When you get home... SURPRISE!

NEGATIVE: Can I just please get a little bit of cream cheese on my bagel? No. You will get half of the freaking tub of cream cheese.

NEGATIVE: We done with knowing how to execute crisp, un-chewy bacon?

NEGATIVE: I dare you to order their breakfast potatoes.

_________________


POSITIVE: Their hours.

POSITIVE: The guy who runs things (I think) is a nice enough guy.

POSITIVE: The customer service (notwithstanding trying to execute their x-ray vision to see through my wife's clothes, and the people refusing to put ketchup on my sandwich) is relatively decent.

POSITIVE: They carry Snapple."}
{"text":"I will no longer buy bagels here anymore. No matter which kind you buy they all taste like an onion/garlic bagel...even the cinnamon sugar!"}
{"text":"Came to Fountain Hills from out of town and found this little gem of a breakfast/lunch joint! We enjoyed a Parmesan bagel breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and bacon as well as a strawberry bagel with honey raisin cream cheese. So delicious! Hot and fresh, great service, and the hubby and I were full for $10. Great!"}
{"text":"This place rocks, and rolls, and bagels.  The deli sandwiches are huge and fantastic.  Especially the Italian Sub and the triple decker club on an everything bagel.  Sides are pretty good too.  Cucumber salad is a good choice becasue the sandwiches are huge.  This place is a real gem for FH- especially if you don't feel like rolling all the way down to Chompies."}
{"text":"I love the Big Kahula Tuna Wrap and the sides that come with it. Canolis are also great. This place was recommended to me by a colleague, I'm glad she did :D I have to agree with a user below though, girls here are a little rude and don't have great customer service - very bad for overall outlook on this business!"}
{"text":"One of the best bagel shops in the valley. Always fresh and the portions are huge! If you are in the mood for bagels  this is on the top of my list."}
{"text":"This place was unique and different to the area, I love bagels so this was right up my alley! It was interesting to try, though it was crowded and the service was a little slow, and because of that the tables were not really clean. I would consider going back, but only if I'm in the area, I wouldn't go out of my way for it!"}
{"text":"The food is great but it's the service that never fails to impress. The employees seem to be young, high-schoolish age and that often leads to indifferent service. Not the case here. Friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Bought a bunch of bagels today. $.95 cents for each bagel and $1.05 charge (each) to slice or toast them. The bagels were better than those at the grocery store, but not as tasty as Panera, Einstein Bros, etc."}
{"text":"We've now been to DJ's a few times while we're out in Fountain Hills for a baseball game.  The food is consistently good although their bagels aren't the best we've found.  The employees are very friendly though and do their best to keep the line moving.  Others have commented about a lack of seating and they're right, it's very limited.  My suggestion for them would be to work on their food safety too.  The cashiers go from handling cash to food and back again without washing their hands.  Sure, they wear gloves but that's not enough."}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY, live in Fountain Hills, they have THE best bagels i have tasted in Maricopa County. Enough said."}
{"text":"Great food....soup is awesome.  One issue, they constantly have Italian wedding soup.  Not bad, but the other soups are much much better."}
{"text":"First time here. Holy Crap was the food good. I recommend the Italian Sub. Wish I would have known about it before."}
{"text":"DJ's bagels is one of the corner stone places to eat in Fountain Hills. They might have the best sandwich selection around. They offer very generous portions and a unique menu. This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"If you know what a real bagel is... then you will understand that this is where you can get a real bagel! Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even. not to mention a great basic egg bagel. Then you have enormous sized sandwiches. And red potato salad to die for. The fruit salad is also amazing fresh cut on site fruit- not your typical nasty slimy fruit salad. Great food. Best bagels. Good atmosphere and in a great location.
I took my Manhattanite-turned-Socal girl friend here and she was SO EXCITED to have a real NYC bagel. enough said!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday morning.  We were a little apprehensive due to what looked like a long line, but decided to stick it out.  Glad we did, as the food was tasty and the line moved along at a good speed.

I had an omelette with the grilled veggies.  I was impressed with the amount ofand variety of the veggies.

The Mrs. had one of the breakfast sandwhiches, which she enjoyed."}
{"text":"This is not only the best bagel place in the area, but possibly the best in the state. I come from New York where we believe we invented all good food, but especially the bagel (and pizza, but that's another story).

I have to admit that after living in Chicago for 30 years I never found a place there (that's still open) that makes a bagel as good as these are.

All varieties (even the fruity ones), a smoked salmon spread that they didn't just wave the lox over, and a bagel and lox plate reminiscent of the good old days.

Service is outstanding, and yes, I've never been there when it's not crowded, but there are almost always tables available outside, and even inside, the crowd is friendly.

I would say that if you enjoy a good bagel, you don't want to miss this place."}
{"text":"This is place is always packed on the weekends for lunch or brunch so I try to go during the week when I get a yen for my favorite sandwich, the Chicken Salad Sandwich or lox and Bagels. 

The chicken salad is a huge sandwich and I always just take half of it home. The chicken salad is tasty, not overly salty and just the right amount of mayo. It's literally one of my fave sandwiches there. With the sandwich comes a side of potato salad and that's just okay, order some chips if you need something with flavor to compliment your sandwich. As far as the lox and bagel is concerned, it's a hit and miss. Sometimes you get a healthy portion of lox and sometimes you don't and have to ask for more. There def needs to be more consistency on the lox.

So here's the deal with this place, while the sandwich is good in my experiences the counter staff is just \"so so\" as they act like they're doing you a favor when they're taking your order. There's no eye contact or genuine interest in serving you or answering your questions (they have a ton of sandwiches so sometimes questions are necessary) and when they bring out your food to your table, the staff is just apathetic and like I said earlier so so.

While I'm happy to always be a 20% tipper or more when I go out to eat, here is a place that you might want to reconsider and just take the sandwich to go (like I do) as the staff could careless of whether they're giving good service or not."}
{"text":"What can I say? Lucky to have AZs best bagel shop in my home town."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have breakfast or lunch.  Their bagel sandwiches are delicious.  Everything is always fresh, from the bagels, to the meats & cheeses, to their sides.  There's so many options and the specials are always delicious.  This is a true favorite of mine.  The staff is great, everyone works together and have make you feel welcome.  I've been coming here for about 10 years but only make it in on Sundays.  You have to try this place, it's worth the drive, and you'll be hooked.  Thank you Dj's!"}
{"text":"I was grossed out because I found a short piece of hair in my bagel. The owner should conder the workers to start wearing  hair nets since they are dropping hair in people's food. Always check your food before you eat otherwise you might end up eating someone else's hair."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff , clean and happy staff.  Lox and cream cheese with capers on a toasted garlic... YUMMMM"}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite place to get breakfast/lunch!! my boyfriend lives in FH and took me here when we first started dating and now he go here multiple times a week:) I got the biggest most delicious salad today! Everything is fresh and just so so good. plus the staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing place. If you come to FH you have to go to this and get a bacon, egg, and cheese. Your life will forever change."}
{"text":"Got a Jones for good, made fresh bagels? Give these guys a shot...you WILL be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by the cafe after a hike at McDowell Mountain State Park. The food looked good and we got in line. I was checking out the specials board and let the gentleman behind us go ahead as we hadn't eaten there before and I was deciding what I wanted. We then proceeded to order. I asked if I could change the bread on one of the sandwich specials because I do not like marble rye. The young girl at the counter seemed very irritated that I asked what kind of bread options were available. And when I paused to consider my options, she literally rolled her eyes twice. I did not find the environment friendly at all. She was exceptionally rude.  I looked at my husband and said I did not like the vibe and walked out. DJs you might be popular, but your attitude sucks. And you will lose customers like me if you treat them like they are an inconvenience to you doing your job. I hope you read this and realize that you made me feel like absolute crap for taking 45 seconds to order. An attitude adjustment is needed by the young brown haired girl working at the counter."}
{"text":"Last night my family and I went here for dinner at 6:25. I know they close at 7 but I didn't think it was THAT late to stop in. I'll start off by saying we should have taken it to go. The food was great but the staffed seemed really pissed off that we came in. They weren't being friendly at all and then after we sat down to eat they were screaming in the back, very unprofessional. They were cleaning out in the dining room (which is fine they were getting close to closing) but then they moved a chair down SO loudly that it forced us to leave. I didn't even finish half of my food and I threw it away. Don't know if I'll be back but if I do then I know I'll take it to go. Wouldn't recommend any coming in after 6 pm!"}
{"text":"This is one of our stand by spots.  It's always good, consistent food. I Iove the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel, toasted! The muffins are also delicious. There is almost always a line to the door but hey, that's a good problem to have I'm sure. Very cool atmosphere and very friendly & quick staff."}
{"text":"Bins of bagels? Check.
Tubs of cream cheese in the case? Check.
Assorted salads? Check.
Snapple? Check.
Big huge fish in the case staring up at you? 

Well, it was almost there.  I won't lie, these bagels aren't half bad.   They have a great selection and the line moves at a good pace, its well controlled.  I was in and out with a really good bagel in no time flat.   The bagel itself was very good, only slightly over doughy, but the outside was nice and crisp.  The cream cheese was also good, it melted perfectly in my toasted bagel.   They have a whole fridge with a great assortment of Snapple.  Really, it is all I could probably ask for in a bagel shop here.  I've giving it 5 stars, but really its a 4.5.   It's a quick drive into Fountain Hills for me but for your average person its probably a bit of a trek."}
{"text":"It is never a bad decision to eat here, no matter how busy it is. Saturday mornings were a tradition for a breakfast bagel sandwich. People visiting Fountain Hills should go out of their way to try this place."}
{"text":"Fast and courtious service. All kinds of bagels and all types of toppings. I love the walnut cream cheese they have. I've only ever found this type of cream cheese in one place ever and that was in some small deli in Brooklyn New York a couple of years ago but I've been craving it ever since and this place actually has it! It's now my official bagel spot. I moved to AZ a year ago and I am so glad I found this cafe. The bagels are made fresh and I have yet to find anything negative to say about this place. They have tables outside if you dont like eating breakfast in doors. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"DJs is the best deli in town, hands down. (Well. It's also the only one). 

The ingredients always fresh and tasty and all prepared to order. The meats cheeses and sides already all boars head so, you know it's good.  You're always going to get a great sandwich and side when you order here.  Plenty of food, decent price. 

The bagels, however, are sometimes less than to be desired. I have yet to have a bagel here that id consider fresh.  Flavorful?  Yes. But often stale. 

The service is great, there have only been one or two times when I've experienced attitude at the counter but everyone has a bad day once in a while, right?  

I'd give this place one less star if the positive experiences didn't out weigh the one or two negatives. 

Give it a try."}
{"text":"Adorable and fun place to eat! Food is great and good prices! Just tried it for the first time today. I got the DJ chicken salad sammy and for the side potato salad. The potato was kinda bland. My only complaint! So many unique choices on dessert too which was also delicious! Also, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best bagels I have had outside of NYC"}
{"text":"The only good bagel shop in all of phoenix.  Closest to an east coast bagel shop that I could find. Healthy Beth wrap is pretty much all I eat, its good. Staff is amazing"}
{"text":"Prices here are insane.  Ordered 2 sandwiches, with one bottle of water, came to 21.95.
The only thing I liked was the salad that came with it.  Place seems to be overrun by teenagers, some of whom have a real attitude, like they're doing you a favor by working there.
Agree with previous reviewers that they should be wearing hairnets.  And a responsible person needs to be managing the place.  I always wonder about the behind-the scenes at these places, regarding any hygiene and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Been here several times and it always impresses. Fast, fresh and quality. Staff is always friendly. Store is immaculate. Coffee is really good."}
{"text":"I live nearby and really like this place. They make their bagels fresh every morning and they make their own cream cheese. I like my everything bagel with the nova cream cheese. Yummy!  They get busy on the weekends very early and once they're out of something, they're out. They always have a lot of everything but I've been there later in the morning on a Saturday and they were out of a certain kind of bagel.  Sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Fountain Hills for over 14 years. The first day we moved in, we went to DJ's for breakfast. Ever since that day, we have been coming back - about 4 times a week! Even more than Starbucks, we see DJ's on our credit card bill. This is the quintessential bagel place for a town of any size. The bagels are certainly the best in the valley, (DJs has won numerous awards for their bagels), and you can get pretty much anything you want on them. The sandwiches are great-even crazy stuff like liverwurst and whitefish salad. Pastries are fantastic (the chocolate crossiant is insane) service is always fast and prompt, and the bottomless cups of coffee and drinks really round it out. There is nowhere on the planet where you can get a value like this: bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on any bagel you like for under four bucks. They are huge. My son is so addicted he will not eat anything else for breakfast. Daughter has a wrap with eggs, cheese and breakfast potatoes and a side of breakfast potatoes, they are that good. I will admit that sometimes I go twice a day. Got to meet Jeff, one of the owners, great guy, lots of fun. Sit inside or out, or take it home, but DJs is the real deal. I have never had any meal there that was less than excellent. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great bagels and fixings. A Fountain brain Hills mainstay for breakfast, or lunch and dinner for that matter"}
{"text":"Decent bagels.  Complete dip shoots serving.  Not bad for ftn hills for bagels   Owner is very nice. Bagels n lox is unreal for the $$$.  I love the feta n sausage omelette."}
{"text":"DJ's is an awesome value! For only a couple bucks more than Subway, you can get an absolutely enormous sandwich from DJ's. I would have been happy if the sandwiches had half the meat and toppings. Go here for a lunch sandwich instead of a chain: The staff is friendly, they have lots of options and you get way more food!"}
{"text":"These people are clearly rating themselves.  Stay away. Ordered 4 egg & cheese on tasted bagel sandwiches.  One minute later they're brought to our table. Sounds good right?  Except it takes longer than one minute to cook eggs and toast bagels. The cold rubbery eggs were obviously cooked long before we arrived. Bagels weren't toasted.  Cheese was that awful \"American\" stuff that comes in slices.  Should have cut our losses but decided to get a baby cannoli.  Must have been 3 days old. Cream was dry and pastry was soggy.

Don't believe the ratings. This place is a fraud."}
{"text":"Fantastic bagel place!  Quick and get the order right each time. I would love to see them carry other milk options for coffee but the bagels are so worth it. Great hometown feel and portion sizes are generous. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food, inconsistent service that ranges from average to incompetent. Last visit, one of the servers tried to overcharge by $15. This visit, I waited 25 mins for takeout because they gave my order to someone else. The cooks, however, are excellent every time."}
{"text":"So many delicious things on the menu, kind if overwhelming so I got a custom wrap which was delicious. Roast beef and turkey wrap stuffed with peppers and veggies on a spinach wrap bread. The wrap bread is vegan in case you are looking for dairy or egg free options."}
{"text":"I have gone to this bagel shop for 20 years and the food is good but the service is horrible. Just recently, we went in an ordered a little over a dozen bagels for the softball team for the town during a morning game. They refused to cut our bagels for us! We explained the situation and how we would not be in a place to cut them, i.e. dugout and they did not care. When asked to speak to the manager, they were rude and not accommodating. They are definitely not involved in the community and do not seem to care at all about their customers now that they have made a name for themselves. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"OK, this cafe can get very busy, very fast and stays that way. And the acoustics in this place are pretty terrible. That makes for lots of busy interactions and makes for lots of noise. 

That aside, this is a wonderful little cafe located in a corner of the Safeway market lot. 

If you are noise-sensitive but want to say, be sure to scope out a seat on the comfortable patio. It is near the road, but that is not overwhelming. Seriously, the outdoor seating is a huge bonus. 

It's a bit crammed inside. You will find mostly two and four seater tables, but there is also some nice bar seating right up on the window. 

And I love the concept -- bagel sandwiches for all! They also have Boar's Head products, standard sandwiches and a nice selection of salads. Lots of options for breakfast. Also, I hear the potato salad is all the rave. 

I went with a bagel and lox. Ample serving! I was only able to eat my half for brunch, and saved the rest for a late afternoon snack. I went with the very garlic bagel. The garlic was so strong, fresh and flavorful! But if you are planning a makeout session at any other part of the day, skip this.

You can also grab an espresso drink here or roast blend. Darling little spot."}
{"text":"This is truly a wonderful place great food great coffee great atmosphere wonderful guys running the place fountain Hills would not be fountain Hills if it wasn't for this place"}
{"text":"I'll continue to give DJs my business, but only because they're the only place nearby that can make a toasted buttered salt bagel. If it weren't for that I'd never go in again. I'm a local of Fountain Hills, but honestly I can't abide by how the place is run. This is what happens when you leave a bunch of 13 year old girls with major attitude problems and no sense of order in charge.

I went in to the register since I'd called my order in and only one woman was ahead of me. The 13 year old at the register didn't smile and actually flat out ignored me. The 17 year old with tattoos all over her shoulders finally asked if I've been helped, then of course three other people cut in front of me. I had a very simple order and what should have taken 2 minutes ended up taking 15. It's almost like a bidding war rather than a line, and all the grouchy teenage girls don't help."}
{"text":"I always get the bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel. Scrambled or fried, both are great. I'll stop by for lunch thinking I'm gonna try a lunch sandwich but always end up with an egg sandwich. They use Boars Head provisions so I am sure the lunch sandwiches are great too."}
{"text":"This is a short one since it's not based on much. My boss brought these bagels in this morning, so I didn't experience the exceptional customer service that other reviews mention. I have no idea how clean the place is or if the location is any good. I do know that these bagels are great. I picked a sesame bagel which was particularly dark, toasted it and added some light plain cream cheese. Delicous. (And I usually have a policy against lowfat dairy!)
I'll have to go check out the place next time I'm up there."}
{"text":"Fantastic little family owned breakfast place near the Safeway in Fountain Hills. I've tried several different menu items and all of them were excellent. They offer a large menu and everything is fresh (juices too) and cooked to order. I like their wraps- they are HUGE and only $5.99! They tend to get busy so you may wait in line, but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"Some friends of ours took us here to grab some breakfast before heading back to Tucson. I thought \"Oh, nice a bagel shop!\" It's a nice little family run business that is a go-to place for bagels, sandwiches, pastries, and breakfast plates. Prices were not scary and our friends told us that it's best to come early as students and families love this spot! The Hubbs had the \"Hot Italian Sandwich\" which was so much better than my whole wheat w/ egg and bacon sandwich. Friendly staff and they bring out your dishes to your table."}
{"text":"Great food , nice staff.  They gave so many options you can really get your good your way."}
{"text":"Love, love, love a good bagel shop!

Fresh bagels in a plethora of flavors and styles. 

I recommend trying one of the breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Its was a busy little place, but they had really great bagels and breakfast choices. We stopped in there for a quick bit to eat several times when we were in the area. Their \"everything\" bagel didn't have as much of \"everything\" on it as I like, but I thought the bagel, egg, ham, and cheese sandwiches were awesome! Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"They have daily specials with those Amazing bagels, fair prices and friendly staff. Get the fresh OJ"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great prices. The only place on the west coast with properly prepared bagels. Friendly and polite staff."}
{"text":"Einsteins and other chain bagel haunts have done a good job of schmearing our expectations when it comes to bagels and sandwiches.  The absolute mediocrity of their offerings have all but ensured that I only drop by in desperate breakfast circumstances.  But those low expectations were changed with DJ's.  No dry and endless chewable bagels here.  Everything is moist and vibrant and I have reason again to consider the bagel as adequate end tables to my sandwich selections.  Great place in a great little town."}
{"text":"Good food...needs a dress code for waiters. A server there was wearing underwear for \"shorts.\" Lost some of my appetite!"}
{"text":"Awesome bagel shop. Definitely reminds me of Jersey bagels. Dont order a veggie omelet though...mushrooms taste like can. But everything else is super delicious.  Love love love me some bagel!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and give DJ's 5 stars (see note below). It's not perfect, but damn close.

I've eaten here at least 5-7 times. The choice is amazing, actually a bit overwhelming for me. Don't be in a rush to order. Check out the menu boards, take a nap, and then place your order. They have great breakfast sandwiches and combos, delicious lunch sandwiches, and awesome salads. \"They're yuge\".

The service is almost always immediate, the food quality very good, and the wait time is almost non-existent.

Note:  I dropped DJ's one star today,  and here's why. On at least 3 separate occasions I've gone there and someone is either shaking out the rug at the entrance,  or like tonight,  an hour before closing they're mopping the floor,  and almost all the chairs are sitting upside down on tables. Not a welcoming and healthy  scenario. Wait till after closing to wash the floor.  The water in the bucket was disgusting."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were huge! The pickles were crunchy! The employees were patient and polite even though I walked in right at close. 

The tomato and lettuce included on the side with the sandwich wasn't needed. 

Otherwise, would definitely eat again!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!! The prices are a bit high and the staff is very rude. I have dealt with several people here and they all have a bit of an attitude! If they had better customer service it would be 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great bagels and cream cheese and especially great fresh squeezed orange juice. Services friendly but a little slow. Haven't tried other breakfast options but they look good, omelettes etc. they also have boars head meat for sandwiches which is very good. there's a reason this place has stayed in business so long it's very consistent."}
{"text":"This place has been one of my favorite spots in town for years. Some of my staples I order are:

Healthy Twisted Rueben 
Bueno Wrap
Healthy Beth Wrap
Tuna Sandwich on Rye bread  

There are many others that are tasty! 

I also love their coffee drinks. My favorite is the iced black & white cookie- sweet and delicious. 


This place is quick & convenient."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
I'm here almost every week. I absolutely love love love bacon and this place has the best bacon omelette. It's a bacon lovers paradise.
They put SO much bacon that it's pretty overwhelming. 
They also have an espresso machine so you're able to get a latte with breakfast."}
{"text":"This place rocks my socks. My two faves are the healthy Beth wrap and the light tuna wrap, their bagel with lox is delish as well. It is very busy, but definitely worth it. I wish they had more locations, but when I am in FH, I make heading to DJs a priority!!"}
{"text":"Ok I've lived in this town for five years and just within the past four months tried this establishment hearing good things about it. I admit in the beginning they had me hooked! I would eat there 3-4 Times a week since I'm in the industry I'd stop in on my way to work to get food for myself and other employees since after working at any restaurant for long periods of time makes eating there kinda boring no matter how good the food is. Anyway the sandwich, sides and canolis and bagles were fresh and delicious at the time. Than one day the canolis were soggy and just NOT very fresh at all. The first time I did nothing just figured it happens and it was not a sign they were NEVER GOING to be fresh again not the case!! It happened again so this time I took them (more than one) back an they refunded my money with a very weak apology. A couple days later I stopped in placed my order an DIDN'T order the canolis since they just DIDN'T LOOK good an by now they knew i ALWAYS bought canolis and the young lady asked if I wanted some. I said yes if their a new batch and fresh of course. She felt them and said they are with that I said sure 4 please. As she went to box them up I asked if the shell felt firm and crispy she began to say YES yet as she felt them she said honestly I don't think their as fresh as I thought tommorow morning ill make new ones. I thanked her for her honesty went back the next day only to see the same old yellowing at the end canolis so I asked again if they were a new fresh batch only to be told they had NO idea how old they are and the young lady from the day before was no where in site to ask!!! Now, being in the industry I KNOW ALL food is supposed to be labeled dated an  knowledge of preparation date!  That concerned me yet the meat cheese and veggies on the sandwich always seemed fresh at the time. Not so much as of the last couple of visits which btw the canolis still are noted as unknown freshness and their words, prefer not to chance it 2 MONTHS LATER!! WHAT??After the first couple of times eating there we also noticed small things like they DIDN'T put an item on the sandwich or the bagel just seemed old and a day or so old. At this point I took a break for about a month returned there today ordered my usually sandwich asked if they could please add extra horseradish sauce on my sandwich which they actually put less on THERE ALMOST felt intentional since I ASKED how are the canolis? Are they fresh today as I smiled hoping to hear of course. Nope! Again told she had NO IDEA WHEN THEY were MADE. I'm sure the disappointment showed on my face and I finally asked HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW LONG ITS BEEN SINCE THEY WERE MADE WITH FRUSTRATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT I got my food to go got home opened it only to see the cucumber/celery salad was soggy and limp which ISN'T how its been served BEFORE. Ok calm down I told myself! Picked up my sandwich to see the havarti cheese I pay EXTRA for BTW is hard and dried out around the edge! Oh MY goodness seriously?? So I decided to open the sandwich to LOOK at the roast beef to see if it seemed SAFE to eat and it did YET remember that extra horseradish sauce I requested? It was none existing and the lettuce was whilted! WOW a 100% total fail on a sandwich I was so looking forward to since I took a break for a while. I'm going to take the whilted lettuce soggy cucumber salad and hard around the edge havarti cheese back an request to SPEAK TO THE manager or owner about the lack of quality and concerns for the food they are selling, do I think it's going to change anything probably not since if the employees are that unaware of the product they are selling, making and serving I'm willing to bet it's due to the lack of concern an leadership of the person running the establishment. I took pictures, NOT sure if yelp will let me attach them or not but I'm surly going to try! It's a shame to watch this restaurant go down hill like it is since under the right leadership it would be 5 plus star's!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and while the food is good minus the hair :-/  the place is complete chaos.   No real organization and ended up standing in line for a called in order. I went to register to skip around the people ordering,  only to have to move aside for the people to pay that were ordering their food there, and when I said something all the \"young\" help thought I was the biggest \"B\" in the town.   Other times getting food,  had a big hair in my omelette that I took back and when girls told the cooks they laughed.  NOT COOL!  I ended up getting a plain bagel after that and actually had to ask for them to refund the difference.  You should be wearing hair nets!   Another 2 times girls forgot to put the pastries I ordered in the bag and had to call and go back to get them.   While I try and not to give negative reviews,  I am getting annoyed with this place and attitude.   While business does not suffer it appears, put them in bigger town with competition and see how far this would get them.  Get a manager at the counter please or one who knows how to run a tight place and hopefully older than 21!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to eat.  Everything they have is absolutely mouth - watering.  The service is spectacular, and it's a great place to eat no matter what meal of the day."}
{"text":"As soon as I moved here every one of my neighbors told us to try this place. It got to the point where I was almost annoyed thinking one of them owned it. It truly is the best bagel shop. I grew up on the east coast where we take our bagel buying seriously...it was tradition to get bagels every Sunday after church until I was 18! Am I credible yet?

Anyway, great place. My husband got the churizo breakfast burrito, and I got an everything bagel with cream cheese, bacon, and egg. We didn't talk to each other the whole time we were eating. This is our new Saturday breakfast place with our kids. Service is always friendly. The fresh squeezed orange juice is just as amazing. Its astonishing that they charge less than 4 bucks for them! How does the burger king stay in business when this place is open right next door for lunch?!"}
{"text":"Our first visit, disappointed by both food and service. Though the menu options and selection of bakery items are quite impressive, the food was quite mediocre. Don't bother with the scones, the worst I've ever had, flat, sogged-out and way too sweet, absolutely no hint of butter flavor, though lots of (or too much) fat used. No resemblance in taste and texture to a proper scone. And the \"scrambled\" egg on breakfast wrap was a hard slab, precooked, and tasted like the powdered egg stuff used on free continental breakfasts at motels.The \"Polish kielbasa\" was soft, spongy, tasted like highly-adulterated commercial brands full of fillers and preservatives. My hubby decided to order a coffee, and waited at the counter, the only customer there, while 4 staff huddled together chatting and the bearded fellow walked over to grab his phone directly in front of him, everyone apparently oblivious until he asked why he was being ignored! They also need to invest in trays for carrying plates to tables...I saw 2 different servers carrying 3 plates to tables, and each had one plate pressed up against their clothing, the food obviously touching their bodies. Truly poor training and supervision! We had high hopes for a great experience, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I live no where close to Dj's, but have considered making the trip to Fountain Hills just to get a bagel. I usually come here every Thanksgiving while visiting family and watching the Thanksgiving parade. To be honest, Dj's is the highlight of my trip every time. The bagels are always very fresh, and the service is also amazing. I can't wait to visit in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"Djs is quick, and convenient. Unfortunately every time i make a visit I'm greeted by the cluttered menu that is almost the size of the width of the restaurant. I get overwhelmed every single time just by the simple hello mixed with the fast-paced environment. Instead of reading the menu I quickly use my go to, which is a bagel with cream cheese. Today I decided to actually order something I never tried. I chose a veggie omlet. The presentation was great but the omelet was not. Anyway it was a mess and I did not feel like eating a plate full of raw vegetables. I decided to throw my $6.99 meal in the trash."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast.  Haven't been here for lunch, but everytime I'm here visiting my wife and I make it a point to stop here.  The bagels are top notch and we always have to fly some home with us.  The service is always friendly and quick, as well."}
{"text":"Mix great breakfast food with even better service and what do you end up with?  A visit to DJ's Bagel Cafe.

We snuck out for a quick breakfast bite and scanned the strip malls for places to eat.  I remember seeing \"cafe\" so we walked on over.  Turns out its a bagel place but heck we're here and well, its packed.

There was a special bagel sandwich, somebody's special bagel... with 2 scrambled eggs, bacon, thin sliced ham, sausage patty, and cheese on a lightly toasted bagel.  It puts McDonald's Egg McMuffin to shame.  And some fresh OJ to boot and you've got yourself a meal.

Service was wonderful, the gals were friendly and helpful.  An enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was amazing. Highly recommend anyone in fountain Hills. Yum Yum"}
{"text":"Freezing cold inside. Rueben sandwich with pastrami was  DELICIOUS and I'm still not sure what pastrami is. Orange juice is fresh as can be. Bagels are standard. Kudos DJs"}
{"text":"Great bagels & bialeys!  Service was great, food was fresh, bagels & bialeys were like NY! I'll be a regular here! Also check for specials on Tues & Fridays"}
{"text":"Definitely an excellent place for breakfast in Fountain Hills! Very casual and family friendly. The service was excellent, in fact the cashier was one of the most outgoing people I've talked to in awhile!

My boyfriend ordered the bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich on a sourdough bagel, and he said it was great. I ordered the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel. The everything bagel is potent so don't order this unless you're an onion lover like me! We split the breakfast potatoes - there is definitely enough for 2. They also make a mean iced mocha and my boyfriend said he enjoyed their DJs Fresh Roast coffee.

To top it off, the price was only $17 for 2 drinks, 2 breakfast sandwiches and breakfast potatoes. Honestly the cheapest and tastiest breakfast I've had in awhile! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The bagels at DJ's are great and they have a lot of choices in their menu. It's a great place to go for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I enjoy their bagel sandwiches (including breakfast sandwiches), their salads (especially their caesar salad with bagel chips), their omelets, and their orange juice. They also have green tea. It's just China Mist, but most restaurants don't have green tea, and it's pretty good (fresh brewed).

A bagel sandwich costs about 6 or 7 bucks (depending on what kind) and comes with a side. Sides include potato salad, macaroni salad, cucumber salad, and potato chips.

They also have good cinnamon rolls and muffins.

Check 'em out if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"We needed a breakfast stop on our way back to San Diego and as always I turned to Yelp.

Busy shop, but fast and friendly staff!  Great choices from the menu from basic bagel sandwiches to full breakfast with sides and lunch fare. The food was very flavorful and presented on the plate with a garnish of fruit.

We travel through here often and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here and got a cinnamon bagel, it was so delicious, best bagel I've had in a while!  My boyfriend got a hazelnut coffee and that was delicious too"}
{"text":"I headed to Dj's to pick up bagels for our family of 4 with my toddler in tow. I had a coupon for 50% off up to 2 dozen bagels. I was told by the cashier that the coupon was only for bagged bagels. Well, isn't that what I was getting?  She said that she could not honor it. I asked her why I couldn't get 4 bagels at 50% off and she told me she would have to weigh out the cream cheese individually for each bagel and charge me for it. I responded with or I can just pay full price and write a negative review and she said sure. 

I don't understand why establishments put out coupons if hey don't plan to honor them. The bagels were just ok and for 4 bagels with cream cheese it was $11. Save yourself the money and goto Safeway next door where the bagels are fresh and the baker gives my toddler a special treat to make him happy while we shop.  I will never visit this shop EVER again."}
{"text":"If you ever visit Fountain Hills, you must stop off for breakfast or lunch at this remarkable Bagel shop. My wife and I had lunch there. I ordered a peppered turkey with salami and pepper jack cheese on an everything bagel. The bagel was toasted just right...not burnt. They aren't stingy on the meats either. When you get your sandwich, you wonder how in the heck are you going to take a bite out of it, cause it's huge!! For the sides, instead of ordering chips, you can have potato, pasta or cucumber salad. My all time favorite is the cucumber salad which has cucumbers, scallions and celery. It is a refreshing salad. 

This place is a whole lot better than going to Chompie's."}
{"text":"Great little gem of a local deli and bagel shop. Unique sandwiches, flavorful sides, and fresh goodies for dessert. And lots of fresh bagels!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Dj's bagels after reading all the positive reviews.  I arrived and it was quite busy, still looking good.  I ordered a bacon egg and cheese on garlic and a dozen bagels to go.   After I took my seat I started rifling through the bagels and they were all quite hard.  I tore open the egg and rye bagels and they seemed old.  I asked the staff if they may be day old bagels and they assured me that they were freshly made same day.  

I know what fresh bread tastes like and what it feels like.  Can someone from the management please help me understand why the bagels were all stale?  Do you make them on site or are they baked very early in the morning?  I was completely underwhelmed by the bagels.  

On a positive note the Dj's Brewed coffee blend was good."}
{"text":"There comes a time in every mans life when he's forced to do something he doesn't want to do. Like go to a craft fair. For me, on this past weekend, it was the Fountain Hills Festival of Arts & Crafts. It was Not my first rodeo... err craft fair. I'm a seasoned veteran. My favorite lady has been pulling me to these things for years. 

For my homiez out there that haven't been in a relationship that requires such sacrifice, I'm going to let you in on a little man secret. This is a great time to start cashing in on some of your wish list items, or a good way to make up for dumb things you've done. As long as you don't whine and pout about having to go, you can use this opportunity to your advantage. 

On craft fair days I always request that we go somewhere for breakfast. Preferably a place of my choosing. Today was a mutual decision and a good one.

We stopped in at DJ's Bagel Caf√© on this fine morning. It was very busy on this Sunday. It's not a big place. This made it a bit cramped. Luckily we were getting our food to go. 

I ordered the Nova aka Lox bagel. This tends to be a go-to item for me when I first visit a bagel shop. This was the best I've had in a while, possibly ever. It was easily the biggest portion as well. They weren't skimping on anything. 

Just an FYI, they had a fruity pebbles treat. It's like a rice crispy treat except made with fruity pebbles. I didn't try it... but it's there. Now I know it's there... and I'll be back for one. 

Unfortunately today was not the day for such indulgences. There was much walking to be done, and I couldn't let anything slow me down... because today... was craft fair day."}
{"text":"Best bagels outside of Chicago - Hands down.  For the longest time, my family and I thought Chompie's was our only option for bagels...dry, hard bagels...until we found DJ's Bagel Cafe right around the corner from their house.  I have never eaten breakfast there, but their bagels will keep us going back every week.  With a Baker's Dozen of bagels on sale every Friday, I know when I come to visit my parents from Tucson that I will always have some quality bagels to take back with me.  Great service, great bagels!!!  HIGHLY recommend!!!"}
{"text":"original Long Island, NYer here from Babylon. This place is the real deal... bagels are awesome and they even have salt bagels too! This place rocks I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best bagels in the Valley. They always have a great selection and they are so fresh. My favorites are the pumpernickel, marble, plain, blueberry,cheddar and multigrain. The have so many to choose from and everyone is very helpful. The cream cheeses are great too. I love the garlic one best.
I've never eaten here, only bought their bagels and cream cheese but they are always busy so the sandwiches must be great too."}
{"text":"This may be fountain hills best spot for breakfast! Or the best spot that I've found anyway.. For Under $13, we got a 2 item omelette (bacon/cheese) with bagel & cream cheese, coffee and a breakfast bagel!  Portions were great and service was quick. Place can only hold about 30 and tends to always be busy when I'm here. Definitely should check it out if you want good breakfast in FH! I'll be back whenever visiting family"}
{"text":"Your basic bagel place. It reminds me a bit of Back East Bagels in Tempe, with various flavors, toppings for your bagel, and regular sandwiches. Drinks include fountain sodas, juice, hot coffee, and espresso drinks. Note that they don't offer any milk alternatives and your milk options will be whole, skim, or half and half.

I had the seasonal pumpkin bagel with butter and a mint chocolate chip iced latte. I requested it toasted and I could taste the pumpkin flavor and requisite pumpkin spices in the bagel. The toasting added an extra textural component with the chewiness of the bagel. The latte had a weird aftertaste to me, maybe due to the creme de menthe syrup, but mainly tasted like chocolate syrup. 

Service was efficient and fairly speedy. This is popular place for breakfast on the weekends and I can definitely see why since it is reasonably priced and fast."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this bagel shop. Def one of the prized cafes in fountain hills. I enjoy the bacon egg and cheese on an everything begal witha little honey mustard. Fresh fresh begals and delicious eggs! A must try if you are in the hills!"}
{"text":"I give the place 2 stars not because of its 
Consistently ok food but the service 
It's only Bagels (mostly I order) but I'm here 
5 times a month at least  and the girls behind the 
Counter are pushy and are losing money for the owner the famous line here is \" is that it \"  not what else can I get ya or have you tasted one of our baked goods or egg sandwiches  no \"is that it\" it is stupid they sound like morons it's not even busy for Pete's sake 
And then expect a tip or to buy drinks 
No way they really need to polish up their customer interactions"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long hike out at McDowell Park, the staff was friendly and very quick. The food was great. We have stopped in here before and they have never disappointed us. I got the chicken salad sandwich this time and I would get it again."}
{"text":"Great food except the lox sandwich went from
7.00 to 13.00 overnight. Counter help can have an attitude but management has always been nice
Best sandwich place in Fountain Hills"}
{"text":"Always good, always friendly, great lunch fantastic bagels. Every time I come in there is a friendly face at the counter."}
{"text":"Great healthy bfast wrap - egg whites, grilled chicken.  Add avocado for an excellent meal!"}
{"text":"Great deli! Tons of sandwich selections...I had the roast beef, potato salad, chips & drink was about $12...everything was fresh & delicious...super nice staff...very clean...will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"They use food coloring in their blue berry, strawberry & colored bagels so beware.  The bagels are pretty darn good, they have been getting smaller and smaller the last few weeks and the price are no longer $5 a dozen they are now up to over $6.50 a dozen.... The bagel sandwiches are priced very good for a breakfast sandwich and they also have cut down on the amount of cream cheese, they used to put about a half of inch now much much less.  Please be careful about buying the strawberry, blueberry and any other colored or fruit bagels as they use food dye in them and food dye is very dangerous for everyone especially children and seniors....  Beware of what they call black and white cookies - they are not made right- all djs does is put cake frosting on each side which is pretty disgusting rather than making them the correct way...........Great for bagels and bagel sandwiches .....haven't tried anything else nor want to.  Overall pretty good value for the money..."}
{"text":"This place is the shit. The absolute shit. The sandwiches are piled high with meat and fresh veggies, the pastry goods are delicious (the effing cannolis are so damn good) and holy cow, in the winter no place has better soup than DJ's. The baked potato soup and italian wedding soups will remind you of your first orgasm. I cannot understand how you could not rate this place high, I have only had excellent experiences here, no hygiene issues, only friendliness and great food. The abundance of girls under the age of 18 is slightly unnerving but to each their own I guess."}
{"text":"Love the bagels, great service, however it's 3pm on a Saturday and it's closed. The closing time says 5, we drove 45 minutes to be this disappointed. What's going on here?"}
{"text":"Yum.   This place makes an amazing bagel sandy!  Bobs special is amazing.  It's not on the board anymore but it comes with heaps of different types of meat, cream brie, roasted red peppers and many other mouth watering ingredients sure to please!  It's a gem!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, DJ's looks like a real NY style bagel shop. They've got the boar's head meats, the assortment of salads (macaroni, cucumber, potato, chicken, pasta, etc.). I was a little concerned when looking at the bagels displayed in the baskets against the back wall though. 

I ordered an everything bagel with turkey, cheese, and scallion/chive cream cheese. They do have multiple options for turkey (cracked pepper, oven roasted, hickory smoked, and something else). I went with the oven roasted. They offered me a side and I'm assuming it's because I got a lunch type of bagel. Therefore, I ordered macaroni salad. After checking out, if ordering in, you sit down and they bring your food to you. 

Execution of the actual bagel itself was lacking. This validated my previous concerns. The bagel was softer and less chewy than what you would get in NY. On the sandwich itself, the turkey was piled on, which I appreciated, but there was hardly any cream cheese. I guess they thought they could skimp on the cream cheese since they used so much turkey. Also, all of the \"everything\" toppings had fallen off, or there hadn't been many put on in the first place. I will say that the macaroni salad was on point."}
{"text":"Best bagel place around! Great breakfast and reasonable. Wonderful service! Great sandwiches with lots of meat. Also great salad selection. Highly recommend DJ's"}
{"text":"The last two times I went to DJ's I had bad experiences. 

1. There was a dark hair in my bagel sandwich.
2. There was a lady bug in my Greek Salad. 

I think I'll be skipping DJ's from now on. Too bad, because I loved it."}
{"text":"A lot of different Bagles to pick from . I love thier tuna with a plain bagle. My husband like the breakfast Bagles."}
{"text":"Yep, I agree with Andrew below.  Having lived in Arizona for more than thirty years, I've been unable to find bagels and bialys anywhere comparable to my hometown of NY.  I had to be in FOUNTAIN HILLS for an appointment yesterday and discovered this little restaurant.  I tried one of their bagel sandwiches, which was piled high with great quality Boar's Head.  The cucumber salad tasted as if it was freshly made for me.  I bought a baker's dozen of bialys and bagels (8 onion bialys, my favorite) for only 7.99!  I ended up eating grilled cheese at home for dinner on one of the bialys, and could have sworn I was back in New York!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a very expensive semi fast food place. We went there for a quick breakfast. My husband ordered a breakfast plate with two eggs, some breakfast potato and breakfast meat, a couple of bacon slices and a couple of very thin cold cut ham. It was $15! What disguised me the most is the woman told me that breakfast should cost this much. She even told me that she had breakfast at Village Inn the day before and paid $24.73. Amazingly, she made up the number to the exact penny amount for the sake of argument. Well, we are local, but this is never going to be our breakfast place again!"}
{"text":"I had a pastrami on rye and it was delicious. They have quite a few offerings in the way of sandwiches - typically stuff like Reuben, turkey and avocado, but they also have some nontypical offerings, too. Service was fast and professional but I was overwhelmed by the menu and the inside was extremely cold. There is a small patio with some seating which looks into the parking lot and an apartment complex but it's worth checking out if you like sandwiches. Good selection of bagels and breakfast sandwiches on bagels."}
{"text":"Great little local joint for breakfast. Fast, courteous service and my breakfast bagel was delicious."}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty, great food at a great price.  Sitting out on the front patio,, nice weather, great food ,, the tossed salad's  oh man.. the picnic salad.. I split it with my wife.. just huge..  there's a reason they've been here for 19 years.  Jeff and Darryl put their heart and soul into the place and it shows.   Almost soup weather ?  Thanks !  You are the first restaurant we eat at when we come back ..  ;-)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Give yourself plenty of time to pick from the menu. I am overwhelmed by the menu every time. I have never been to a place with so many things to choose from (these are all positive things). I usually am one to stick to only eating one thing anywhere I go, and this is one of the first places I have ordered many different dishes and liked most of them! The service is really fast, food is delish, many options and very customizable. The pastries look amazing, many sides to choose from. The staff are always very nice as well! :) one of our favorites here in FH."}
{"text":"I come here often because the fools is consistently fresh and yummy! Great menu variety for all taste buds!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience. 

GREAT FOOD. FAST SERVICE. CLEAN. 

Sometimes there's a line, but it always goes by fairly quickly. 

Love,love,love this place!"}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast this morning and let me tell you I hate coming here because of the service. The girls helping you are rude and don't seem to want to be there, the bagels are tasty but the cream cheese it way to expensive. Its the only place in FH that has bagels with lox that tastes decent."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  The portions are large so I recommend sharing. They do keep it simple and it says right in their name this is a bagel place so don't expect croissants or something other than bagels or wraps.  Consistently good food."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is busy.. Every time I go its day old bagels at best last time I had about 2 bits and trashed the rest of it.. I also tried the breakfast sand.. it was interesting to say least bagel was hard had about a bite of it then trashed it. I deffently dont plan on coming back. Service is friendly thats why I am giving 2 stars and a stretch however food is lacking."}
