{"text":"Waiter was extremely knowledgeable about his menu. Considering the fact that I've never been to a Peruvian resto and was quite hesitant as to what to have, it was a major plus. I dont remember the name of the meal I've ordered but it was in the appetizers section. It was something like a layer of mashed potatoes , a layer of shrimps, another layer of mashed potatoes so on and so forth. Absolutely delicious. Spiced perfectly. I will definitely go again. Note that this restaurant is a little bit more on the pricey side, but its SO worth it!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montréal with my wife (Bolivian), we planned on eating out at a small French restaurant on Wellington. Unfortunately the French restaurant was replaced by a sushi bar so we decided to try to find another place to grab supper. We asked someone in the street who turned out was Peruvian and recommended to go check on Villa Wellington. 

Their chicha morada was great, the plates were huge, their aji was delicious and the prices were much better than what we use to pay back in California. My wife was really happy and that's enough for me to say that this is a really good Peruvian restaurant,"}
{"text":"Bon restaurant, toujours du monde il faut réserver. Les serveurs sont très aimables et bon vendeurs ! J'ai goûté au rouget, aux patates péruviennes et aux côtelettes d'agneaux, ces plats étaient très bons."}
{"text":"We then ordered the small dish of Jalea. This dish encompassed everything perfect for a summer nighttime meal, seafood and FRIED. This dish is a trio of shrimp, calamari and fish, with a bonus player of potatoes.


The batter was perfect, not too thick, and thin enough to add a nice bit to the seafood. I especially appreciated the onion slaw on top that had just the right amount of vinegar to cut through the oil and heaviness of the batter. Like I said, this was the small order, and were told that it's a personal portion, and the large was meant for two. As you can see, they obviously meant it would be enough for one person, should that person be a professional wrestler or a reality show reward challenge."}
{"text":"I went with a friend last week and I ordered the fish cevice in the hopes of something fresh and bursting with lime and maybe a little spicy... I was a bit disappointed as it seemed more salty than fragrant. My friend had the fish stew and that was very well balanced. Also I ordered the cevice as an appetizer and found it gigantic. I would have liked to get half of it for half the price that would have been perfect."}
{"text":"On était un groupe de 10 personnes. On a commandé différents plats et on s'est tous régalés. Tout était bon et les portions très généreuses. Je recommande vivement ce resto pour découvrir les plats péruviens."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by any of the dishes I have ordered here over the years. The staff are super helpful and friendly, the plates are enormous and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. Some of the best ceviche I've had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Authentic peruvian food.  the waiters are very aware of their menu and give good advices to someone who never tried peruvian food before.  On another note,  their home wine (Spanish)  is very good and affordable."}
{"text":"Although the food here has always been impressive on many visits, i have to say im a bit dissapointed to see my favorite dish go from $17.95 to $27 in the space of a couple years...."}
{"text":"Don't remember what we had - chicken in some kind of sauce. Not memorable at all, sad to say. Did like the vibe and service so I would give it another shot. Great looking patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Notre première visite à la cuisine péruvienne, les plats grands généreux, mais surtout délicieux. :))
Bon service, on y reviendra!

Choisissez un des plats péruviens, car ils ont aussi des choix mexicains."}
{"text":"Très bonne surprise. La cuisine est excellente. Je ne connaissait pas la cuisine péruvienne mais ça m'a donné envie de tester d'autres resto du même genre :)"}
{"text":"Excellent! De la cuisine péruvienne authentique! Belle atmosphère, tranquille, romantique; avec de la musique latine en sourdine. Vous serez gâtés par la qualité des repas et du service!"}
{"text":"C'est la deuxième fois que je vais à la villa Wellington et ça ne sera pas la dernière !
Très bon plats, vaste choix, prix abordable, personnels très accueillant !
Je vous conseille ce resto !!!"}
{"text":"It was OK for everyone else except me.  I found an old rusted bolt in my meal.  I'm sure it was an accident and the place was really sorry about it.  They didn't offer to pay, but offered a free beer and dessert.  Took the beer and refused the dessert.  This was a year ago.  Hopefully, I'm the only person that experienced that."}
{"text":"I swung by Villa Wellington a few days ago for an early dinner with a friend. I was getting tired of the grease-fest that was turning out to be the theme of my trip and I also kind of wanted something healthier (no such luck, mostly) and flavourful. I'd been to VW once before, a few years ago, but I don't remember what the dish I had was called, only that it was a stewy beef on rice concoction, a reddish-brown sauce infused with coriander, which didn't taste as good at the resto as it did the next day when I had it as leftovers. I had hoped to get that dish again as I tried without success to lay off the grease with this one meal. 

We were in a bit of a rush that night as we had a show to go to downtown so we had to skip the apps portion of the meal, but not the booze. ;) Thankfully we made a reservation about an hour ahead as it was rammed when we arrived (it was packed the last time too), and there was a constant flow of people coming and going the whole time. Note that tables are also placed very close to one another so at times you may feel suffocated. Service was efficient, and we were seated once we announced our reservation. Upon ordering, a basket of warm focaccia rolls (one each) and butter were brought over. 

I was unable to locate the dish I had before, though I was sure I was on the right track when I'd asked for the coriander beef with rice and beans. We shared that along with a small jalea (another popular dish). The beef dish was not at all what I had the last time but it was still good: small pile of rice, stewed beef brisket in a mild brown gravy, along with a ton of beans in another mild gravy, but a gravy different from that of the beef. I don't know if this dish is supposed to be bursting with flavour but it wasn't, though still very fresh and good. I noticed a few other tables had ordered this as well. Not bad but there wasn't really any noticeable coriander present which was a shame. The jalea came in a tall bowl containing a heaping pile of breaded, deep-fried seafood, just as the menu stated: calamari, shrimp, and fish. All this under a pile of onions that were not too onion-y and useful for bringing alive the beef dish a bit, but also a handful of fried, slivered potato. The jalea was not at all greasy and all those heavenly bits were cooked to a perfect golden-brown, served with their creamy light-green mild hot sauce (it wasn't really hot, and I have no idea what the name of it was) and mayo (I thought it might be aioli but it wasn't). Most of it was calamari and too few pieces of fish--I couldn't tell what kind of fish it was but it was white, dense, and moist. Most likely a generic one that one finds in their grocer's freezer. Portions were quite big such that we couldn't finish more than 2/3 of the meal--even I was shocked that we didn't finish as we are both big eaters! I was sad to be leaving behind so many morsels of fried seafood uneaten but what else could we do? We gave it our best shot.

I think the menu may have changed a bit since the last time I was there, but I could see that the Mexican and Canadian sections still exist. There were a handful of dishes I would have liked to try so I'll have to check them out again another time. What I really wanted was the papas rellenas but it only came in appetizer format, although given their portion sizes, an appetizer at this place probably would have been sufficient as a meal! I'm not a seasoned Peruvian cuisine connoisseur but Villa Wellington comes highly recommended by a lot of my Montreal friends and it's worth a try if you've never been."}
{"text":"Je doit avouer être une cliente de ce restorant péruvien depuis des années mais je n'ai jamais pensé laisser un review avant ce matin.Mea culpa. 

Mais, des restaurants de Verdun, c'est un de mes favoris. J'y ai mangé de la salade à l'avocat et poulet (ou crevettes), délicieuse et fondante dans la bouche (l'avocat du moins) qui remplis bien maigré le fait que c'est une salade. J'ai aussi mangé de leurs plats mexicains et leur riz frits, tout deux excellent. C'est chez eux que j'ai fait mon baptème de Ceviche et j'ai l'eau à la bouche quand j'y pense. 

Ils ont des mets un peu étranges comme des fish and chips, que l'on ne s'attendrais pas a voir dans un menu du genre mais un jour, quand j'aurai fait le tour de leur menu authentique, j'y gouterai peut-être. 

Les portions sont énormes et conviennent à une personne de bon appétit. Ne pas hésiter à demander de raporter votre 'restant'. Leurs riz friz est encore meilleur réchauffé.

Je finirai ma critique par un petit conseil... si vous avez le choix des places, évitez la petite table de deux personne à gauche de la caisse ;-)"}
{"text":"Notre restau préféré du quartier. C'est délicieux et très raisonnable. Le ceviche de poisson épicé, choclo con queso, mero a la macho, beef hearts are amazing! Seco con frijoles, leurs petits pains chauds avec la sauce piquante et l'hiver, on aime bien la soupe aux fruits de mer. 
Portions généreuses!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem in Verdun. I was visiting Montreal for a few days and while staying in Verdun for a few, I decided to check out the neighborhood.

My girlfriend and I were very impressed with this place and while it is not the \"best\" Peruvian I have ever had I thought it was very delicious. We shared a plate of chicken and it was very flavorful and reasonably priced. 

FYI the glasses of sangria are huge!"}
{"text":"J'ai commandé le ceviche pour emporter. J'ai trouvé que le poisson avait un ou deux jours de trop au gout. Mais pire encore était la minuscule portion de ceviche par rapport aux garnitures. J'ai ouvert l'emballage et découvert 2 immenses feuilles de laitue iceberg avec une très épaisse tranche de papaye et une montagne d'oignons blancs crus et quelques feuilles de coriandre hachée sur le dessus, sans huile ou lime ou vinaigrette quelquonque. Quand j'ai soulevé ces gigantesques et inutiles décorations pour découvrir le fameux ceviche... c'était une minuscule portion de sole pas vraiment fraîche coupée grossièrement et mal assaisonnée.  Pas de coriandre, pas d'avocat, pas même un peu de pico de gaillo. La seule raison pour laquelle je leur donne plus d'une étoile, c'est la façon dont ils ont sans rechigner accepter de me rembourser."}
{"text":"Apparently one of the first Peruvian restaurant in MTL, and it doesn't disappoint! We tried their Pisco Sour (quite legit), their mixed ceviche (a must in this warm weather!!) and their tamales. The service is warm and welcoming, and the price is decent for the portion size. We will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Petit resto péruvien dans Verdun qui en apparence n'a l'air de rien mais qui cache une expérience tout à fait agréable.  Fait intéressant et étrange, ce resto offre de la bouffe péruvienne, mais également de la bouffe mexicaine et canadienne (???), comme quoi on cherche à plaire à un large public.

Je suis allé à 3 reprises et à chaque fois j'ai eu le même service, soit tout à fait souriant et chaleureux, comme si on faisait parti de la famille.  Je n'ai pas eu la chance de goûter à grands choses car, malgré un grand choix de plats, je reviens toujours aux calmars frits servis avec une salade d'oignon et pommes de terres.  Les portions sont très généreuses.  J'ai bu de la sangria qui était très bonne.

Lorsque je quitte le resto, je suis toujours très satisfait et mon estomac est toujours bien rempli!!  Le prochaine fois, je me fais un devoir d'essayer autre chose que les calmars...quoique... :))"}
{"text":"Interesting menu with a lot of different choices. Unfortunately, the dishes were not as tasty as expected. The fried calamari was tasteless and rubbery. The shrimp ceviche not tasted very fresh and it was too salty. We took the stew beef with cilantro as a main dish. The meat was not tender and the sauce does not tasted the cilantro at all. Service is really good and efficient. The small terrasse outside is perfect for the summer days."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner on an icy cold night recently. Everything from the service to the food was excellent. The chicken paollo (spelling?) was on the table d'hote and was very good. It's a place I've wanted to go to in Verdun for some time and my first visit won't be my last. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! Portions are very very generous. Service is good and the staff is very nice. Make sure you pay them a compliment if you like it, they'll be very grateful. It looks family owned and they know the real deal of Peruvian food."}
{"text":"Good place to discover Peruvian food and atmosphere. Good waiters and really helpful. I loved this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"nice tiny resto. Service was quick and friendly. The food was good but a little bit salty for the fried rice I ordered. But in general I like it. FYI it is always good to make a reservation before going.:)"}
{"text":"Very nice family style Peruvian restaurant in Verdun.  The Ceviche Camarones is tasty but very, very, VERY spicy...so proceed with caution.  I will go back with my wife and kids.  I think they'll enjoy it...but very lightly spiced :)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Peruvian restaurant in Montreal that I've eaten at. The service is good, most of the servers speak Spanish first and French second, then English if even.. The restaurant is decorated very Peruvian like, with the walls covered with Chullo's, pictures and small Inca statues. My favorite meal is the Jalea  plate, which is massive, big enough for two people as a main meal, or shared among a group as an appetizer. Ceviche isn't my thing but everyone i've been there with loves it. They have a very large menu of traditional Peruvian dishes and beverages including Papa Rellena & Chicha Morada (a traditonal beverage made from purple corn) or you can always go for a Peruvian soda call Inka Cola. 
Price is moderate, well worth the amount of food you get and the quality of food! :)"}
{"text":"J'y ai mangé le plat de ceviche de poissons. Surmonté d'une montagne d'oignons effilés en fines lamelles, de maïs et de patates douces. Des cubes de poisson blanc parfaitement assaisonnés, d'une belle texture et très frais. Ce plat est tout indiqué en saison chaude. Les portions sont copieuses. J'avais aussi mangé un burrito une fois, très satisfaisant également. Ce resto péruvien est toujours plein, et je comprend pourquoi."}
{"text":"My very first Peruvian experience. Came out bloated (isn't easy for a foodie like me to say) and grinning from ear to ear. 

The staff looks all Peruvian. The menu, though, is a hotch-potch of Peruvian, Mexican, Chifa (Chinese style), Italian, and some standard North American. That, in no way, takes away from the experience. Peru is a country of diverse ethnicities and thus diversely influenced cuisine. 

I ordered a can of Inca Kola, which automatically comes with a glass to pour it in, minestrone soup with basil, and lomo saltado. Been waiting to try the lomo saltado for a couple months ever since my Peruvian friend said it's his favorite dish. Boy is it huge! I had to take a third of it as leftovers, yes, and I did mention I left bloated. Mix in the rice with the beef and veggies before taking a mouthful. And whoa! Inca Kola is like addicting. If you like A&W root beer or creamy soda of any kind, you'll like Inca Kola. Chicha morada is equally good. It looks similar to red sangria, but tastes like spiced fruit juice."}
{"text":"I'm coming to this restaurant almost every week. The quality is incredible. I highly recommend the \"choros a la chalaca\".  Goes well with a Jalea or Anticuchos.  The Sangria is delicious. If you don't ask for that one, ask for Chicha Morada or Inka Kola. I'm going back tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"What a great find! It was a snowy Sunday afternoon and we haven't had lunch. Yelp correctly told us that this Peruvian place is open throughout the afternoon. The place is cozy with lots of Incan decorations. We tried the Jalea, which is a dish of lightly battered and fried calamari/shrimps/fish, topped with some fresh onions. Squeeze some limón on top and it was so delicious. The stuffed potato was filled with ground beef, olives and an egg yolk, tasty as well. I would definitively come back to try some of their other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Having eaten in some of the best local eateries in Peru, I was open minded yet cautious in giving Villa Wellington a try.  

Street parking was easy to find. On the doorstep looking in, there was not a single \"Peruvian-looking\" person aside from the staff.  Oh well.  

The resto is pretty small and tables are packed pretty close together. To get to the bathroom, you have to dance around the tables to find the best path.  That being said, you must reserve a table if you wish to eat on weekend nights!

The entree was pretty good, though the potato scoops were a touch too salty. 

Anticucho (when masterfully cooked) is a meatlover's dream.  It comes with a beautiful seared flavor, is savory, tender and juicy.  Unfortunately, the anticucho on the Piqueo Wellington was none of those :(  rubbery actually and somewhat tasteless. 

If you want to have a taste of real good anticucho, go to Sanduchon in Cours Mont Royal and order the anticucho duck heart burger... Then, you'll know what Imma talking about!!! 

The ceviche was a bit tough and fishy tasting. Now you may ask, \"Isn't fish supposed to taste fishy?\" Well, there's the fresh \"fishy\" taste which I love and the \"fishy fishy\" taste that I don't as much. Such was the case here.

However, the calamari was delicious!  Tender, flavorful and very satisfying with a squeeze of lemon :)

Was super excited to try the chicha morada here cause they say it's not powder but home made. Ordered a glass. The taste of cinnamon was too heavy and there was not enough tang to it. Overall, very average chicha morada. 

The yucca fries and pork chiccharon were pretty good.  Satisfied with the way it was made! 

Overall, if you've not had authentic Peruvian before, this place is a good intro experience but nothing beats dining in Peru!"}
{"text":"Came here on a spontaneous trip with a friend yesterday, this wasn't our target restaurant but on our way we passed this restaurant and thought we're really famished and decided to eat here instead. The guy who served us was really nice and attended to us really well. My friend had the Ronda Caliente I believe, it's a seafood filled plate and the amount was generous enough that my friend had enough for takeaway. I had the Fajitas Carne and it was served in a sizzling plate that reminded me of my favorite dish in my country. On another plate, they gave me the wrapper and the sauces and you roll the meat on your own. I loved it, the dish was super good and I plan on going back there soon to try an actual Peruvian dish. Shame I forgot to take a pic in my excitement to eat!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on the recommendation of one of my coworkers who lives nearby.  She couldn't stop talking about this place and how it was one of the best places for Peruvian food in town. Now I can't say that 'm an expert on Peruvian food and this is the only Peruvian restaurant I've been to, so I'll reserve my comments to what I know.

Let me start by saying that with a name like Villa Wellington I was sure this place was a souvlaki place! But boy was I wrong.When you first walk into this place you notice it's colourful table cloths and cozy feel. Our waiter greeted us at the door and showed us to our table, he was all smiles and instantly made us feel at home. He was incredibly helpful and nice and when he found out it was our first time visiting the restaurant he took it upon himself to make sure we had a good experience. We never felt rushed even when there was no one left in the place they made sure we knew we could stay and take our time. I have to give the service 5 stars.

The food was great we ordered a little bit of everything tapas style and shared it between the two of us and we were both surprised at how good the food was the only dish which we found to be ordinary in comparison with the rest of the food was the calamari, not that it wasn't good but it regular calamari as opposed to great like the other dishes were. The sea food ceviche was awesome, it tasted so fresh and light I could eat that alone everyday. We then had Papa Rellena which I had never had before and they were also awesome. Everything was just very good.

I found one little funny thing, I think this may be a left over from the neighbourhood Verdun use to be. When you look through the menu you'll notice Italian, Canadian and what seem to be non Peruvian dishes. I suppose this is to make sure everyone can find something to eat, even if they aren't sold on Peruvian cuisine. This is definitely a place worth trying and proof that Verdun or as my friend Rod calls it the Wellington village is really becoming a great little neighbourhood.

I hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"I tried to like the ceviche, but it was too salty! Sorry, the staff was so nice, the lady there reminds me of my mom. What I can say I loved were the anticuchos, I would come back for those in a heartbeat. The jalea was not my favourite, but the causa left me wanting a second portion. 

This is not a critique to the restaurant itself, I just found it peculiar that they offer Mexican and Italian dishes, the couple sitting next to us were eating some sort of tacos and the other pasta... I was so confused, but I guess it's just that people here are more familiar with that and it sells? I bet Mexican and Italian with Peruvian ingredients would be delish though, just not what I would order if I go to a Peruvian restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the reasons proving that Verdun is now becoming a foodies part of town, Villa Wellington is one of the better Peruvian restos in Montreal. While there are more authentic places in and around the Jean Talon area, Villa Wellington serves some of the best calamari and shrimp I in Montreal. The Papa Rellena, a mashed potato fritter stuffed with beef and gravy is one of the best comfort foods I've ever had, perfect for our insane winters.
Bonus: they serve Inka Kola here!"}
{"text":"We were helping some friends move into their new apartment around Wellington, and needed to grab some food in the area.  Another friend recommended this Peruvian place and we decided to go check it out, not expecting much. 
This place was awesome! Apparently, its quite good as there is usually a line for tables, but we were lucky, and got a table right away.  The waitstaff only speak Spanish & French, and I believe that the menu is in French.  We ordered calamari, a steak plate, chicken in tomato sauce, and a traditional Peruvian dish with potatoes & chicken (sorry, don't remember the official names as there were all in French).  When the food came out, the portion sizes were huge! The food was very flavorful, the meat was tender, and the homemade sauce was amazing.  All the dishes that we ordered were fantastic, and better yet, there were leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"Ma première expérience avec de la nourriture péruvienne a été toute une belle soirée! Comme d'autres avis l'indiquent, avec un nom comme Villa Wellington, c'est définitivement pas le style de restaurant auquel je m'attendais.

Je suis allée avec trois autres personnes et ça nous a permis de prendre quelques plats qu'on s'est partagé. Si vous y allez, considérez faire la même chose parce que les assiettes sont géantes! À quatre, on a demandé les coeurs de boeufs (le serveur nous a demandé si on était conscientes de ce qu'on commandait pour ne pas nous faire de mauvaise surprise), du poulet à la coriandre, une salade verte et des calmars frits. Deux repas principaux et 2 entrées plus tard, nous en avions assez pour en ramener à la maison pour un autre souper. Je dois avouer qu'on avait déjà beaucoup mangé cette journée là mais les portions sont quand même énormes.

On a aussi pris le vin maison et on a été agréablement surprises de sa qualité. Un vin espagnol qui vient dans une grosse bouteille d'un litre!

Et le service! Notre serveur était super souriant, nous a aidé à choisir notre repas et s'est assuré à ce que nos verres de vin soient toujours bien remplis, jusqu'à ce que notre bouteille soit vide.

Somme toute, une super belle expérience et une découverte inattendue."}
{"text":"I've had Peruvian food a few times in the States and I was pleasantly surprised! The menu was in French so the owner's son was kind enough to help me pick out a few favorites , tamales filled with chicken, shrimp ceviche and these fried potato patties filled with beef! I also had the house sangria (soooo good)! Everything was fresh, delicious, and large enough portions that could feed two people. The owner was constantly checking on me to make sure everything was ok. I would def go back to this place when I'm in town. Great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"When i used to live in Verdun, this was the place that i would go to eat at. Great food! Huge servings! Super friendly service! Good price. And even though the choice of wine is very limited, the price is reasonable. I pretty much tried all their dishes and was never disappointed.

I still come to this restaurant even if i no longer live in Verdun. Great place to go to for good comforting Peruvian food! Would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"J'avais trouvé juste correct meme si j'avais faim. Plusieurs tables, bon service. Its up to you. J'ai trouvé aussi qu'ils pourraient s'ameliorer dans la propreté des toilettes."}
{"text":"We love this place! Very delicious food and friendly service! Deep fried seafood is so good! Can't miss it!"}
{"text":"Civiche wasnt fresh. Tasted fishy. We shared the fajitas for 2 they gave us 3 tortillas. The cheese and guacamole was out of store cartons. Nothing had flavour. Was disappointed. Waiting on bill ages."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant et se la même famille que Augusto al gusto ambiance différente plus tranquille beau décor bon service et la nourritures. Et excellent très savoureux et goûteux et les prix pas trop cher jai adore ca"}
