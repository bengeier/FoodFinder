{"text":"Chicken wings are soo good and perfectly seasoned. The yams/sweet potatoes are beyond great..the greens are fabulous the mac n cheese is not my favorite it has a strange flavor to it.  I've had the ribs which I believe are baked not grilled they were average(I don't like baked ribs or par boiling before grilling) at best. We also had the fish dinner the fish was pretty much a giant fish stick not tasty at all.  Why the 5 stars??  1. The wings are the best around 2. All the sides with the exception of the mac n cheese were very very good. 3. The staff!!!! They are beyond great  I believe they should just stick to chicken since thats what people"}
{"text":"I was born in Birmingham Alabama and grew up in Nashville Tennessee, I know Soul Food! This is it! Pittsburgh hold on to your bootstraps, from crispy catfish to the most tender and perfectly seasoned collard greens, this is what it's all about. The wings are tight and the yams- like candy, perfect! Amen"}
{"text":"New to Pittsburgh and was really in the mood for some soul food. We were out and about and decided to search for local soul food places. There were a few places that popped up but  their name was catchy and so we called to place an order. We thought ok it should be around $35 max for everything(3 platters). It was a $50 tab. I have never paid $50 for soul food in my life. So I was a little disappointed especially since the pork chop meal only came with one chop. I thought it was always standard to have two chops on a platter but not here. NOT UP IN THERE!!!! One chop! Ok so....I opened my platter up.....PLOW DAW....THE AROMA WAS KICKING LIKE JACKIE CHANS SISTER....YUMMI CHAN!  I was very impressed. The one lonely pork chop was thebomb.com so so so so good. Perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The mac n cheese was creamy and the yams were sweet and gooey just like I like them. I also had the potato salad(was decent). My sister had the fish platter. She let me taste some of her fish and I wanted to turn the car around. The best fish at a take out spot I have had in a VERY long time. I do a lot of traveling and hands down the best soul food ever! Try their wings also. Very good. The price was worth the food. You get what you pay for. I am surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. If you want really good, quality, fresh soul food please check these people out! You will not be disappointed!"}
