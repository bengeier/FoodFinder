{"text":"Very slow service, clearly they are not prepared to serve the number of people their restaurant holds.  Almost 2.5 hours for a glass of wine, an appetizer and a bowl of pasta.   

The two appetizers (fried artichokes and a burrata dish) were competent but dull.   For the mains, we had boar agnolotti, which had a sweet sauce that totally overwhelmed the dish.  It was like desert for dinner.   The crab pasta order was messed up and we were served spaghetti and olive oil.   It was, not surprising, very plain.   We got a complimentary glass of wine, but they charged us $20 for the spaghetti and olive oil.   Ironically, it was better than the agnolotti.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Much improvement over the first couple of weeks after the opening. Food arrived on time. Pizza is not under cooked. 

3 stars because 1) menu has too much emphasis on carb 2) servers confuse you into ordering bottled spring water by calling it stillwater and calling tap water \"mississauga 's finest. Very cheeky. Maybe they're trying to be cute? 3) Morretti tasted very skunky and watered down. Came home and immediately opened a bottle of Morretti to check and confirmed their beer was off. Would still go for pizza because I can get a ok pie w/o having to drive to Oakville downtown or Roncesvalles, but for pastas casalinga or Michael's is much better. They need to rework their menu to ease up on carb and balance it w/ protein w/o having to order a second dish."}
{"text":"This was definitely not very good. Limited menu, boiling hot inside and incredibly loud and very slow service. Food is very ordinary. Better choices nearby like the Clarkson Pump."}
{"text":"Came back for the 2nd time,  made a reservation to make things easier.  Asked for a high chairfoe my kid,  and when coming in the table had it already.  Very thoutful I love that.

Since my first experience was so good,  I was excited to try more menu items.  To test how good this place's food is I got a dish I HATE...  Beets. My co-diner loves beats so much,  and she was in love with their beat kale salad.  Me?  Loved it too!  So impressed with this place,  they managed to make a simple salad with beets that I normal don't like into something I would get again because it was good.  Bravo. 

Got another pizza (fungi) and some pasta too. Everything was great,  transported me back to Italy.  This time tried a dessert for the first time,  it was great. It had lemon curd and berries with cream and cake.

Again service was top notch,  also Massimo was walking around again greeting customers and hanging out.  Again,  love that the owner has a presence here and seems like this place is another home. Keeps everyone on check to keep the food quality up,  smart!  ;)

Absolutely in love with this restaurant. Such good food and service. I hope this place is a mainstay and I have decades to dine here."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance of the place, it has a warm, family feel to it. I loved the spahettini with crab & salmon roe and my friend loved her pasta too. The service was great and very friendly. We had tiramisu for dessert and it was good, only thing i would suggest would be to put less cocoa on top because there was so much of it on top that it takes away from the enjoyment of the dish when the cocoa powder gets into your throat and makes you choke up, Lol Overall love it! Just less cocoa please"}
{"text":"Massimo Capra was in the kitchen on a recent weekday lunch, which explained the perfectly seasoned and plated food. This restaurant is hidden in a simple strip plaza in gentrifying Clarkson. Questionable decor includes cardboard hung strategically on walls. (Emperor's new clothes?) If you can overlook  that there's nowhere to hang your coat, that the server fools you into ordering $6 bottled water, and the $13 subpar cocktails, then this is the place for you. Stereotypical suburban menu overemphasizes carbs and desperately needs a secondi (meat) section. Awesome dessert tartufo full of delicious nuttiness ($9)."}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice menu options, good patio. They can make a side of kale/cabbage/brussel sprouts into a standout dish. The clam pasta was nicely seasoned, the calamari was fresh and cooked to the right texture. Pizza crust was perfect. Food had a tad too much oil for my taste but enjoyable nonetheless."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding meal there last night.  Great atmosphere.  Excellent service from ALL staff. Fabulous decor. 
The food was the best Italian I've had outside of a Nonna's kitchen.  Absolutely divine.  Can not wait until the next visit."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this place!! OMG the decor is so cute. 
Cozy and sophisticated. Total King Street west vibe. 
The food is authentic and not American Italian, this is the real thing people. 
Delicious, great quality food. 
Thank you Massimo for the deliciousness. 
The salami board is a must. 
Gnocchi is delicious, and the lamb is my husbands favorite. 
Do it, just gooooooo!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a couple friends and it was pretty good. We ordered a variety of dishes and some were much better than others. The labneh appetizer was delicious, and I think that's a Middle Eastern dish rather than Italian. The pizza was just okay. The cheese had a bit of a weird taste/texture to it. A tad rubbery. The ravioli we had was just boring. But the chocolate board for dessert was pretty yummy. 

A couple things to note: parking is heinous. The lot out back is small and the plaza beside the restaurant is full of signs telling you that you can't park there and some dude in one of the stores ran out and told us to leave the plaza parking lot before we figured out that it wasn't the parking for the restaurant. We had to park across the street. Also, the foot rung for the stools is really low on the stool so my legs and a male dining companion's legs were just swinging freely. Not a pleasant way to spend a couple hours while dining. They should get stools with two levels of rungs perhaps."}
{"text":"Came here for my dad's birthday. Service is a nightmare.

Wanted to order wine and asked for a recommendation, but before he made a recommendation the server simply said \"I'm not much of a drinker\", which didn't give me much confidence in ordering. 

We ordered our food, which was okay at best and WAY over priced. To add to the frustration my fianc√©e didn't get what she ordered and she waited another 30 minutes to get what she actually ordered. Meanwhile everyone else ate their dish because it would have gotten cold and when she finally got her food she was eating on her own... Which isn't what you want when going to a restaurant (overpriced restaurant) together as a family. 

Won't ever come back. Won't ever recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to, and I have been to Italy dozens of times. Have had almost everything on the menu and have never had a bad meal. Always a pleasure to see Massimo or his wife as well . They have built an amazing restaurant with excellent staff and I will visit them for years to come."}
{"text":"I had deceived to treat a client to dinner and get caught up so finally booked a reservation at Capra's. Our first fantastic experience came with our server Jason. This guy knew every detail of the menu and specials. I selected the Tenderloin and let Jason select all my sides with his recommendations. My client has the pasta with meatballs. The service was awesome , dinner was absolutely delicious and the ambiance of Capra's exceeded my expectations. The chocolate heart dessert was fun to break and yummmmmy. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was my third visit. We arrived with no reservation so we were sat on the patio which was good until it cooled off. Luckily this coincided with us finishing our starters and a table coming up inside.
Our waiter, Jason was attentive and knowledgeable. He was friendly and recognized that we enjoyed an informal style of dining. 
We shared some great starters, octopus carpaccio and prosciutto cotton were superb. The labneh was divine as was the grilled calamari.
Our mains included lamb loin, chicken supreme and a beautiful roasted whole fish, followed by semifreddo and a chocolate charcuterie board. Wine, beer and water were all served.
Massimo was in the kitchen and all was perfect."}
{"text":"Ok I almost hesitate with the three star because it definitely was more then that,  but four star to me defines excellent as I'm kind of stingy with the five star. I'll put it this way, I definitely want to go back. The hummus was good although the boyfriend described it as amazing, either way worth ordering. We had pizza and I have to say the crust was seriously good. Thin, but not dry, yet not flimsy. Honestly it was damm good. You could definitely order one pizza and an app or two and be totally fine. Service was lovely as well. My downfalls are although we were in there at 2:45, we ordered around 3 and at 3:04 she came back and told us she didn't realize the time and that the only thing they served between 3-5 was apps and pizza (we originally ordered something else). I don't know considering it was 3:04 and we ordered before three, I'm thinking they probably should have sucked that error up. Also although the food was lovely it's a pretty basic looking restaurant and perhaps overpriced for what it is. I do want to go back and try the mains.... note to self go after five. If you haven't gone, go... it's worth the trip at least."}
{"text":"This was my third time coming to Capra's, and I was very disappointed in my most recent visit.

We had a group of 10 for Saturday at 6 pm. We arrived at 5:45 pm and did not leave until nearly 8 pm. 

The food came painfully slow - there was a 20 minute gap between placing our order and when the appetizers arrived. Then there was another 30 minute gap between when appetizers were finished and when our mains arrived. 

Once we received our mains, they had forgotten 2 of our salads, which took another 10-15 minutes to come. As a piece of advice, don't order the caeser salad. It was one of the worst caesers I've ever had in my life - it was over dressed and had odd ingredients - like shredded hard boiled eggs. But hey, to each their own.

Half our table ordered the spaghetti with clams and the other half ordered the tagliatelle - we all noticed that everyone's tagliatelle was lukewarm.

Auto gratuity was set at 20%. So thanks for the slow service, average food, and giving yourself a 20% tip to top it all off."}
{"text":"Good food, good service but the portions are small for the $$. Love Rosa and Massimo and most of the staff is excellent. I love the decor and special details! My favorite dish is the brunch item with eggs, salmon, avocado toast and salad. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here very last minute, called them up and we were able to make a reservation. The woman that answered the phone (Carmen) was very accommodating and friendly. We arrived and the place was completely packed and people did not seem to want to leave because we still had to wait about 20 minutes. We actually didn't mind because the staff was so nice and apologetic about it, plus we got to see Massimo in action working around the kitchen and bringing in fresh food!
I love the layout and decor of this place, nice and open, music was not too loud and you can see right into the kitchen, no secrets here.
We decided to get the hummus, polenta tots and the zucca pizza (well done). The hummus was the best hummus I have ever had in my life! No joke. I would come back here just for that. Whatever olive oil they used was amazing. It was garlicky, crunchy parts, fresh just A+. The polenta went really well with that app, nice and hot to counterbalance the cold hummus. Now they pizza stole the show. How inventive to make a zucca pasta dish into a pizza! Mind blown. It was perfectly done, the flavours were balanced, the crust was crunchy (get it well done), and it went amazing with the chili and olive oil.
Now can we talk about the price?! 35 all together and we brought two slices home. Are you kidding me?! A lovely sit down restaurant, amazing food, we were completely stuffed and it was 35 dollars. You can't beat that.
Massimo also made a point to walk around the restaurant and talk to everyone, he even took a picture with my boyfriend. 
I am super impressed, and well I don't impress that easily."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially because it's in my neighbourhood.  I was cynical about a margherita pizza that wasn't cooked in a woodfired oven.  Boy was I wrong... the crust is crispy where it should be, while also being soft where it should be.  Massimo's mushroom salad is beautifully seasoned and the tiramisu is a resounding success.

It loses a star because my family and I have been a couple times and each time, the service was just a little off.  Not rude, just confused and a little manic.  I'm assuming that this is common with a new restaurant and I'm sure these bugs will be ironed out in the near future.

Parking is a little tight around back but I've seen much worse."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service at this restaurant. 

We called over an hour before and were told if we came in before 5:30 we should not have an issue getting a table. 

We planned carefully to arrive on time. Called again while on the road and on time might I add, we were then told they were double booked. Not only that, but the hostess would not give me an approximate wait time until I pushed for one. Which she quoted me at 40 mins. 

When I arrived (4 minutes later) the number jumped up to 1 hour. 

I find it difficult to comprehend how a restaurant can have a designated amount of tables required to be left for walk ins and then be told that those tables were DOUBLE booked. 

Not only that but when we arrived the hostess was cold and unfriendly. I understand when a restaurant is this busy you may not feel the need to have the level of customer service other restaurants do. But after traveling the globe, I have never seen worse customer service, I get better service and courtesy at a chain restaurant, then I would here at this establishment."}
{"text":"Wow....loving this place. Simple, rustic Italian dishes that are executed very well with quality ingredients. A simple concept, but restaurants like this are hard to come by in the west end. Service was on-point (we were a group of 8) and although I didn't see many kids there, the atmosphere was very much family-friendly. As a vegetarian, I was also thrilled at all the vegetarian options on the menu. I will most definitely be back to try them all! The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wine list. Selection is small and much of it is very expensive. Of the reds, only 3 bottles were in the $40 - $60 range."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal, outstanding service, outstanding d√©cor, this is a great spot!!!

Nice vibe to the place.  Ask for Natalia, she will take great care of you and engage beyond the regular server banter.  We had a fun time.  She loves serving \"basic\" drinks.

Was there for a work meal, started with the daily special tuna app and the bruschetta and polished that off.  Entrees ordered at the table included the mushroom risotto, Pancetta wrapped Stuffed Chicken and the Salmon Filet, oh, and to top it off we finished with a Skor ice cream dessert.  All parties were completely satisfied and had a wonderful evening.  Would recommend for a work dinner, romantic dinner or just a fun night out with friends.  Visit, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Capra was during Savour Mississauga.  We weren't overly impressed but we allowed Capra to redeem themselves a couple of weeks later.  Capra is located in the Clarkson neighborhood of Mississauga.  For our second visit, we went to Capra's for a birthday dinner with family.  I called ahead to let them know of the occasion and they had a birthday card signed by Chef Massimo awaiting at our table - a nice touch. The restaurant has a warm interior with unique lighting and a bar lined up with wine bottles to the ceiling.  I noticed that the restaurant was filling up fast and Chef Massimo was making his rounds greeting diners.  
As we settled, I had let our server, Jason, know that one member of my party had a low sodium requirement.  Jason was great.  He knew the menu and specials off the top of his head and even described how the dishes were prepared and which ones could be made with low sodium.  We started with drinks and appetizers of bruschetta and crispy garlic and chickpeas dip.  Both dishes arrived and they were delicious.  The dip was especially tasty that came with soft bread and was topped with whole roasted chickpeas.  Jason (who provided great service throughout our visit) came by for our dinner orders.  There was one item that we asked if it could be made low sodium - the Capra Pizza.  He checked with the kitchen and he said they could accommodate by removing the tomato sauce.  Along with the Pizza, the table ordered Spagettini Clams, Salmon Filet, Agnolotti Wild Boar (on the advice of Jason) and Tagliatelle Bolognese.
It took a little while for our orders to arrive.  However, while we were waiting, the Manager, Joanne came by to check in on us.  That was appreciated - great customer service.  The food look a little longer than expected, probably because they do not rush you here.  When the dishes came, they came piping hot.   Members of the party raved about the Spagettini Clams and Salmon Filet.  Both tasted so fresh and the salmon was a big filet portion cooked perfectly with caviar lentils which was a nice touch.  I had the Bolognese.  Most restaurants overpower the bolognese with tomato sauce. Not here.  It was in perfect balance so the meat flavour of the beef, veal and pancetta shines through and goes perfectly with the al dente cooked pasta.  The pizza was good, even without the tomato sauce and was big enough for 2 people.  The Wild Boar dish was amazing.  I had a chance to have a bite of this.  It was ravioli stuffed with wild boar in a rich mushroom sauce served in a unique circular dish.  Very unique and tasted great - thanks for the recommendation Jason!  Jason came by periodically to re-fill our drinks and check in on us.  We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert.  However, Jason came by with a big plate of Neapolitan ice cream topped with whip cream and a birthday candle.  He lead us to singing \"Happy Birthday\" and we all had some of the dessert (there is always room for ice cream!)  A great way to cap our great dinner experience. If you go, do make reservations.  We will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Great food in a warm and inviting atmosphere!
After hearing that Massimo Capra's latest restaurant was situated in the heart of Mississauga, my husband & I were looking forward to giving it a try.
We arrived to a packed restaurant just after 8 p.m. on a Saturday night, but luckily were able to sit at the bar with s full view of the appetizer/dessert prep girl and kitchen.  We were originally going to wait for a table but decided to stay put as we really enjoyed watching the hustle & bustle of the kitchen staff, prep staff & servers.
We started off the night with a meat & cheese shared board which was a nice variety of meats, cheeses, olives. house pickled vegetables fruit mostardo & focaccia bread.  Next we shared the Caesar salad consisting of baby Romaine |Fried Mortadella| Spicy Anchovies &!Shaved Pecorino. As someone who eats a lot of Caesar salads, let me tell you this was one of the best I have ever had.  The dressing was divine.  The lettuce & ingredients were so fresh &'that spicy tangy dressing was so delicious & unique.  Next I had the Lamb T-bone | Tomato | Olives | Caramelized Onions & Thyme & my husband had the Tagliatelle Bolognese: Beef | Veal | Pancetta | Wine | Crushed Tomatoes.  Both meals were delicious & the portions were large enough that we had some left to bring home for lunch the next day.  We usually don't order dessert but we couldn't resist ordering the Chocolate Charcuterie Board, the highlight being the white chocolate mousse.  
We had the pleasure of meeting Massimo at the end of the night who obviously is very proud of his new restaurant,   He expressed his desire to bring a top-notch dining experience to Mississauga and we think he has done just that.  
We will definitely be back and will recommend Capra's Kitchen to all of our friends & family,"}
{"text":"It's my birthday week!!!!! And tis the season to celebrate! 

To celebrate my boyfriend took me to Capra's Kitchen. As per all my friends suggestions we made reservations for 5 o'clock and it wasn't busy at all! Upon arrival it was a tad confusing the way the building is set up you would think that the parking would be in the front. However, a sign is up asking all Capra customers to please park at the back of the building. Once you get to the back of the building there is a door to enter Capra's but there isn't anyone to greet you at that door which was really strange. Instead we were instructed to walk through the restaurant back to the front where a hostess was waiting for us. We were promptly seated and provided with menus.

I ordered the bruschetta to start and the beef cheek gnocchi. My boyfriend ordered the tagliatelle bolognese. The bruschetta was pretty good but the tomatoes on top were very cold in comparison to rest of the toppings. My main was good but not anything spectacular. The pricing was moderate and the decor and overall atmosphere was very nice. It was very chilly inside so make sure you dress warmly!!"}
{"text":"Everything at this place is ultra delicious. Great service (accommodated us despite having no reservations and the place being full)"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant a couple of weeks back with some coworkers. The decor is interesting, though not very cohesive. Everything looks like it was found in a second hand store and thrown together. The waitress suggested a \"amazing cocktail special\" which sounded so much better than it was. I did not find out until I got the bill that this drink was 15$. I ordered the mushroom pizza and for something that cost $18, I was totally underwhelmed. Finally, our waitress suggested a chocolate and cookie chacuterie board for 4 people (we were a party of 8 but did not want too much dessert) and granted it was quite big, we were charged $56 for average tasting dessert. I am a big dessert fanatic and I could not understand why I was paying $56 for a board of minature cookies and chocolates which were so plain tasting. I frankly could've gone to any bakery and found much better and higher quality dessert. All in all pretty average but for the price, things just didn't seem worth it to me. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Capra's is a beautiful restaurant with delicious food. The reason for my average rating is their service. We popped over for dinner on Friday night. I would recommend a reservation as the restaurant does get busy. We were greeted right away and seated. We had our drink orders taken and placed our order for appetizers and entrees. Our appetizers arrived very quickly. We ordered their veal ravioli, octopus carpaccio, bread sticks and olives. Everything was fresh and seasoned well. Our entrees were delicious but the wait was almost 40 minutes for them. It seemed everyone around us received their entree except us. I wished they acknowledged the wait before I had to follow up. I hope to visit again, as we were getting our final bill the table beside us just received their entree very quickly. Perhaps our order was just simply missed that night."}
{"text":"For decadently delicious Italian food, this is the place to go. Service was prompt and courteous, food was divine but the ambience could be better. 

I ordered the white veal Ragout while my friend ordered the mushroom risotto. Both dishes were delicious but my veal was succulent and contained plenty of meat.

For lovers of authentic Italian food, this is the restaurant to visit"}
{"text":"We know that restaurants have issues that go beyond their control. And mistakes will occur. However its how the management handles the problems that defines whether a restaurant is worthy of a great review.

We had phoned in a reservation for 10 people at 4:00 pm on a Sunday. When we got there they couldn't find our reservation. However the manager Joanne took care of the situation and prepared a spot for us in their private dining room. At first I thought \"here we go....a nice table in the basement\", however we were pleasantly surprised at the space. Lots of sunshine, a big screen TV during the playoffs and great service made everything better.

We were celebrating my Mother's 94th birthday and they arranged a nice little dessert with a sparkler and then provided a dessert board free of charge for the trouble.

The menu hasn't changed much from their opening about a year ago. Their pasta dishes seem to have gotten a little bigger. Their pizzas are thin and taste great. The grilled calamari and meatball appetizers were also tasty. The pasta bolognese seemed to be a table favorite.

Overall we had a great time."}
{"text":"Make sure to make a reservation! It's super busy and for a good reason! The food and service was amazing. Highly recommend the Crab Spaghettini!"}
{"text":"This is a neat (but very noisy on the Patio) restaurant very close to Port Credit Mississauga. 

My food was the Marinated Olives for an appetizer...they were very tasty. My main was Benny Porchetta (Eggs Benedict w Porchetta). This was absolutely delicious. The Porchetta was a delicious change to peameal bacon. The benny sauce was rich, creamy & oh so good!! 

We were served by a delightful young lady but she wasn't very good at her job. She forgot our olives order to start. And when the food was served there was such a gap in between when 1/2 of our party got their food to when the other 1/2 got theirs, my food became cool. Not a great way to start your meal. She also forgot the spices (salt/pepper) for the table & sugar for my Latte, so it became cold as well!! If you focus on the food, it was very tasty but a restaurant is not JUST food, it's service too. 

I'd go to this place again & eat inside but with a different server."}
{"text":"Had the Calabrese pizza and it was really good. Quick service as well. Only issue is parking is odd. Little hard to find and if it's full you're a little stuck as they are adamant you cannot park to the east of them as the other owners are uncooperative"}
{"text":"Ok...The rundown...
Calamari Fritte and Burrata with some Ciabatta and EVOO/Balsamic
My little ladies had Orrechiette in a cream sauce, and Spaghettini in a tomatoe sauce
Momma had Wild Boar Agnolotti and, and Daddy had Flatiron steak with Polenta and winter greens...
In a word... Amazeballs
Dessert was tiramisu, and a chocolate bonet (kind of like a chocolate flan)
Busy Friday night, but never felt rushed even though the kitchen was banging out the dishes quickly...
Was wonderful to see Chef Capra walk through the restaurant checking in on everyone and saying hi....

We will be back..."}
{"text":"Had a lovely birthday meal with a friend here yesterday. The service was amazing. Michelle was our server. She was attentive, funny and treated us extremely well.

Every Monday evening in November they have a list of wine bottles that are 50% off. I suggest you take advantage of this.

While I was waiting for my friend, I ordered the basket of bread. It came with 2 of each - breadsticks, focaccia and a roll. The bomba it came up with spicy and vinegary and was so good with the glass of wine. 

My friend ordered a simple spaghettini with tomato and basil sauce. I had the gnocchi with braised beef cheeks, ricotta and fried sage. It tasted good & was perfect for the cold weather. The pastas were not made in house but our server assured us that they were sourced by chef Capra and the quality was very high. I agree. The gnocchi was one of the best I have had.

We also shared desserts - a cinnamon creme brulee (OMG!!!!!!!) and a Tiramisu. The desserts are made in house and they were very good."}
{"text":"I've been to Capra's Kitchen several times. Last time I even brought my team out for a business dinner. Everyone loved it! The menu is simple with a great variety for everyone! The service is attentive and accommodating to allergies and custom specifications! Way to go Massimo! Welcome to Lorne Park! We are happy to support you!"}
{"text":"Portions were small and mediocre at best. Would not substitute mushrooms (wife is allergic to them) and had to remove the onions because they were sauteed together. Entree was a 6oz. steak on a thin bed of mash potatoes. Would not serve bread even though i asked to pay extra. they reversed the desserts and all I got was a smile and an apology. This is our 4'th time there and our last."}
