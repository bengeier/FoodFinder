{"text":"Absolutely, the worst place to go. The food was really bad, pizza we ordered was burnt, we got fries instead of a poutine, and when we asked to get what we ordered, we got massive attitude from the Manager. They never got my order right,never got the poutine, the manager is an unfriendly tool who has the biggest F U attitude to all his clients.
I wouldn't go back to if they paid me."}
{"text":"Terrible food - bad everything it's gross the only thing that was good was the cold 7up. I don't even know what mystery meat was in my chicken club sub."}
{"text":"Though I had fond memories of this place from years past, a recent pizza disappointed. The crust was literally a premodern frozen crust, though the toppings were decent. Definitely not Delissio."}
