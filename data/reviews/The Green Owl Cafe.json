{"text":"This vegan restaurant is AMAZING! It is so warm and cozy inside! Everyone was so nice and friendly. They have amazing tea (not tea bags either like real tea ) and a nice size menu. My husband got the Jackfruit quesadilla which was out of this world, being dairy, vegan and gluten free! I had the CAMPANELLE ALFREDO which had the best flavor and so so good, this was also gluten and diary free! For dessert we shared a piece of vegan and gluten-free cheesecake which was delicious  The best part our bill was only $35.00 which was not bad at all. We will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"I come to Madison fairly frequently for work and make a point to come to the Green Owl as often as possible. It is so delicious that I talk about it back home in Boulder all the time wishing it were located in Colorado. We have plenty of vegetarian fare in CO, but none of it compares to what the Green Owl dishes out. I have been vegan for over a decade, and this place is at the top of my list for best vegan food--ever. Better than any veggie food I have had in NYC, Chicago, SoCal, Denver, etc. So here are my favorite things on the menu:  1. Chocolate Molten Lava Cake. Vegan. VEGAN LAVA CAKE! It is ridiculously delicious. I get it every single time I eat here.   2. Crabby Cakes. Vegan. These are vegetarian \"crab\" cakes with a chipotle remoulade sauce on a bed of chopped romaine lettuce. They are savory and \"seafood-y\" and scrumptious.  3. The BBQ Jackfruit sandwich. It is like a vegan version of a heavenly BBQ pulled pork sandwich. What is jackfruit? It is some sort of tropical fruit, but they don't serve mature jackfruit, so it isn't sweet. It stands in for pork but without the soy or the gluten. Don't bother with the wikipedia description of jackfruit because it will give you the wrong idea. Just order this and enjoy and be forever happy with your decision.  4. Empanadas Picadillo. This can be made vegan upon request by subbing vegan sour cream. The empanadas were so good! Like better-than-empanadas-from-Mexico good. Make sure to ask for the green owl hot sauce to go with this. Mix the sour cream with the beans and rice to pretend you are eating gallo pinto in Costa Rica.   Other delicious things I have eaten here: The schnitzel, Caesar salad with grilled tofu, kale crisps, TLT with avocado, a delicious soup-of-the day (split pea, I think). The drinks are also good, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic (housemade kombucha). I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy the most delicious vegetarian/vegan food in the world."}
{"text":"Really good food and service even for omnivores!"}
{"text":"Really great restaurant, ate here for dinner, and the next day for lunch. I ordered the vegan jambalaya the first night. It was healthy, not mind blowing, and came with some very well cooked Kale and cornbread.  For lunch I ordered the the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, Tomato w/ Avocado). Very common vegan menu feature, but done so well here with the best ingredients. One of the best sandwiches I've had from a restaurant. It comes with a really nice vegan aoli, and great bread. The side potatoes tasted like local produce.  Really great for vegans...my friends all loved their meals."}
{"text":"I am very sad that the Green Owl doesn't live here in Milwaukee.  It's fantabulous!  Great food, warm atmosphere, nice people, what's not to like??  We ordered the TNT (tempeh bacon, lett, tomato w/ avocado) and the curried chick'n sandwich.  Both were fantastic with flavor and the sides were tasty and original (crispy Kale chips?!).  The TNT sandwich was a little on the small side, I have to say, but the flavor made up for it.  Great local beer selection, nice staff (Heather was very accommodating and quick!), cute decor.  If I was a Madisonite, I would be at this place several times a week."}
{"text":"I like the Green Owl, but I think there is a little room for improvement.  They have an extensive and diverse menu, which I really like.  The atmosphere is nice and I love the decor.  I know that they are filling a previously unfilled niche here in Madison.  Unfortunately, my entrees haven't been that tasty.  They are ok, but not amazing.  I'm going to try a couple more options and update."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  So incredibly delicious! Great vegan menu with an abundant number of choices. The TLT was great and is order it again. Fun location and  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd find a good vegan/vegetarian joint until my sis-in-law took me here. I recently turned vegan and knew my choices at restaurants would be limited when I eat out. I was super excited to discover this place!   Service was awesome. Very friendly and laid back. Most impressively, they seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs and the philosophy behind this cafe. I felt at home here!  I went back the next day and the same waitress remembered that I enjoyed the white sauce for my red roasted potatoes so much that she offered to give me some with my two-year-old's order. The place is aesthetically pleasing as well."}
{"text":"It was about a year ago that I was here so information might not be the most up to date, but I remember how good the food was!  Their kale chips, \"crab\" cakes with chipotle sauce and their lavender dark chocolate \"cheese\" cake were all just AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS.  I don't even remember what my entree was but I remember not being very impressed with my entree at all. The awesome appetizer and dessert did make up for it though.  I guess I would have given them a much higher rating if I didn't feel like the portions were really small for the amount of money they were charging. I remember when the \"crab\" cakes got to the table I was like \"Holy crap those are tiny! And we paid WHAT for these?!?!\"  but they were indeed tasty."}
{"text":"I went with 2 vegetarians and every thing sounded  unappetizing. Fried seitan just sounds unappealing, and I don't want to pay 11 dollars for freaking gluten balls. We walked out before the meal started."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get here is the Crabby Cake Poboy. It's consistently amazing, and if you're one of those vegetarians that misses fish sandwiches, this is the best. I've also had the BBQ Jackfruit sandwich and also the TLT with Avocado, both of which were nice. The Vegetarian Italian Beef was awesome, but I haven't had it since they first opened.  Not to miss here are the desserts! Even if you're full, get something to go! I highly recommend the coconut cream pie, but I believe their desserts change daily.  The only negatives: kale chips are usually oversalted, and the portions are on the smaller side. You won't have leftovers.  But definitely give it a try (even you meat-eaters!). They also have a full bar and nice drink menu."}
{"text":"I've had mixed results and thus mixed feelings about the Green Owl, but one thing is always true: dessert is delicious.   The entrees have been hit or miss for me. A dinner of schnitzel and stuffed peppers was dry and lacking in flavor. A dinner of pasta with cashew Alfredo sauce and Green Owl Macho Nachos tasted much better, though the nachos' ratio of toppings and sauce to tortilla chips was much too low. About halfway through the pile of nachos, I was piling on green hot sauce (which was quite tasty) to make up for having run out of the beans, avocados, other toppings, and nacho sauce.   In regards to that nacho sauce -  my cheese-loving companion deemed it \"delicious\" but it wasn't quite present enough to make for the creamy, bountiful of nachos (vegan or otherwise) I've enjoyed at other restaurants. I liked it too, and I would have liked more of it.  At brunch I again ran into the dryness problem. I ordered nuevos rancheros and though they come with that same hot sauce brought out with the nachos, the rancheros themselves were very dry and lacked seasoning. I doused mine in the hot sauce and, in a rare move for the shaker, a serious sprinkle of salt. I also tasted the biscuits and gravy, which were quite good.  The dessert is consistently good. I don't usually order dessert at restaurants, especially at brunch, but it's what the Green Owl does best and I always at least split one. The cheesecakes are always dense and flavorful, the coconut cream pie is a great combination of crunchy crust and creamy filling, and the peach and bourbon panna cottas served this morning were well balanced, smooth, and flavorful.   Overall, if you're willing to gamble on dinner or brunch, go for it. But if you want a sure bet, skip the meal and get dessert."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great brunch here with my husband.  He had the tofu scramble, I had the Wisconsin omelet (beer carmelized onions! Yum!)...we also shared a scone (with coffee, an appetizer of sorts)...and we finished off our meal with creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was so good...the portions were just right, just enough to make us full without making us feel like we needed a nap and some alka seltzer (like some veg restaurants I know of), the atmosphere was relaxed and we felt right at home, waitstaff was very friendly and genuinely sweet, our food was nicely presented and frickin GOOD...even the roasted potatoes that came as a side with our meal were tasty, and even the house-made ketchup was delicious! This place makes me love Madison even more than I already did before. We'll definitely be back and reccommend the Green Owl to friends visiting Madison."}
{"text":"This was a Yelp discovery for us.  We were looking for a nice healthy alternative to the franchise fare and we found it here.  There is a huge menu with all kinds of delicious selections.  We liked it so much we stopped by for a second visit during our long weekend visiting Madison."}
{"text":"Really great place for vegetarians and omnivores alike. One of the reasons I love this place is that it is one of the few places in town that will actually take reservations for brunch. Their meatless dishes actually mimic meat quite well. The decor its kitchy and cute."}
{"text":"Four stars is probably a little generous for this place, but I honestly want to support it due to Madison's lack of solid vegetarian/vegan options.  Having moved back from San Francisco a few years ago, I have been undoubtedly spoiled, but... this place could do so much more than it does.   The food is good and the ingredient quality is impressive, but the menu relies heavily on fake-meat concoctions, rather than striving to highlight and elevate vegetarian/vegan cooking to the level that it deserves.   I almost feel like places like this do more harm than good when it comes to educating meat and cheese-worshipping non-believers (and Madison is certainly full of them). There is so much that can be done with vegan cuisine and I wish this place would explore a little further--maybe check out menus from SF restaurants Millenium, Manzanita, Cafe Gratitude, to name a few...  Anyway, I don't want to be too hard on The Green Owl, because I am grateful for what they are trying to do... and there are some things they do extremely well....  the vegan desserts are certifiably awesome, the soups/salads are delicious, and though I'm not crazy about faux-meat dinners, the vegan schnitzel with creamy-mushroom sauce is pretty impressive and tasty... although, considering the prices on the menu, I think the portions could be a tad bigger--the restaurant tends to be a little inconsistent with this as well.  Overall, I'm a fan of this place and I recommend it, although I hope that they continue to evolve as well as inspire other veggie-friendly restaurants to sprout up, because I still feel a considerable lack of options in Madison."}
{"text":"Certainly not a vegetarian, though I have dabled with vegetarianism in the past so I can appreciate good non-meaty food. I had trouble finding something on the menu that did not include a soy-based meat substitute. I decided on a bowl of root vegetable soup and a side of kale crisps- both very good. My friend had a mediterranean plate which we agreed was very average. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the decor was hip, however, the dining room was very chilly. (We noticed other people eating with their coats on as well).  There are excellent restaurants in Madison with delicious vegetarian dishes- this would not be one of my top picks."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Got the jackfruit quesadillas, the vegan Caesar salad, a cocktail, and the two special vegan cheesecakes. Everything was seasonal, fresh, and really innovative. The service is also really good. It's a great place to eat outside, also!"}
{"text":"I really liked my first time at The Green Owl. I had been looking forward to going there since reading their menu.    I asked the waitress for the items on the menu that were both gluten-free and vegan, she was really nice and went to the kitchen to double check.  I ended up having the middle-eastern platter appetizer and the vegetarian jambalaya entree.   The app was tasty, and the gluten-free chips that came with it were surprisingly good!  Also, they brought out pitas for the wheat-eating members of the group.  My single concern was that even after I had discussed my dietary needs with the waiter, I still got a salad with sesame sticks on it. It was not busy when we were there, so it was a pretty clear oversight.  However, the waiter was really nice about it and immediately made me a brand new salad.    The only thing I would have appreciated would have been if the waiter detailed what made a dish gluten-free.  It would have helped my food-eating decision process.  For being the single table in the restaurant for awhile, service was kinda slow.  Overall, it was a very nice experience and it's great that a restaurant is offering dairy-free and gluten-free options.  I'll be eating there again."}
{"text":"Good food.  I am not vegetarian - not even close.  I'll spare you the quote from Pulp Fiction...   The menu offered many items that sounded good to me.  I had a hard time choosing.  I decided to play it safe.  I had the TLT w/ Avocado and opted for a side of kale crisps.  The kale crisps were quite a surprise.  I was expecting something that looked like a potato chip.  Nope.  They were deep fried kale leaves that were nicely seasoned.    I probably won't go out of my way to go back there as I am not vegetarian.  However, I won't turn down the opportunity to return with one of my vegetarian friends."}
{"text":"I hate doing this because I really want a vegan place to do well-- but damn, the food is really just blah and at times weird. We had the Mediterranean plate for an appetizer-- the bread was stale and the baba ghanoush looked like baby food and tasted awful. The rest was super bland. For an entree I ordered the gyros sandwich. The way the sandwich was plated was bizarre. They take a pita, place about 2 or 3 strips of vegan gyros in the center, fill the rest with lettuce, onion, and tomatoes and fold the pita in half. It's a pocket! Why would you do that and make every bite I take be of stale bread. They were probably attempting to mask the fact there were only 2-3 pieces of faux gyros.  The tedzaki sauce is pure liquid lemon.   It's sad because I really really wanted to like this place. I wish the Chicago Diner existed in every city!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with friends to use a Groupon. Overall, it was a nice meal but not for the price, even with the Groupon.  I got the Groundnut Stew and my husband got the Vegetarian Jambalaya.  My husband actually liked his dinner even though he is a huge lover of meat!  The flavors of the food were great, but the portion size was very small, relative to the price.  I also got a raspberry ginger zinger drink (I'm not sure if that's what it was called) and it was delicious!  Our friends got the jackfruit carnitas quesadilla and the sesame peanut noodles.  Their meals also looked delicious.  If you're looking for a delicious place for vegetarian or vegan food, this is a great place if you're  willing to pay a little more."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for a convention at the end of October and when I found out about the Green Owl, I had to check it out.  I'm so happy I did. The place is in a cute neighborhood, the decor is sweet, the food was delicious and the servers were so nice.   I usually don't order sandwiches because the bread tends to be too filling, but I ordered the BBQ Jackfruit sandwich just because it sounded so interesting. It was fantastic and just the right size. So inventive to use jackfruit to mimic pulled pork. It was tender, sweet and a little smoky. The kale chips were unique and delicious, too. My Dad got the Vegan Schnitzel and loved it.    Next time I'm in Madison, I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great vegan options... every dish I've tried is very flavorful. I always get the Orange Blossom Lemonade too"}
{"text":"The Green Owl is my favorite restaurant in Madison. Sometimes my body needs food that is fresh, delicious, and delicately prepared that won't put me into a coma and I simply can't afford to spend $50-100 (for two) at a place like Harvest. The food at Green Owl actually makes my body feel invigorated, without weighing me down or depleting my wallet. This is not the fanciest food in the world, but for the price, there's nothing like it.   The Ceasar Salad, for example, is AMAZING. Whenever I eat one of these at a different restaurant, I can almost feel my arteries clogging up with grease. This one tastes way better and it makes my body feel good! Also adore the Schnitzel and the TLT."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of the previous reviews.  The food is, for the most part, diner food with clever meat substitutes. Don't come expecting to find robust and imaginative vegetarian entrees with an ethnic flair.  I would recommend Swagat, Himal Chuli, or the Mermaid Cafe for that.   However, the food is nice when you miss your meaty favorites.  The menu is always a challenge for me because I miss so many of the diner flavors.  I want one of everything!  I had the Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato sandwich.  It wasn't bacon, but it did meet my craving for a good BLT.  My dinner companion had the schnitzel and spoke highly of the marinara sauce.  He also raved about the vegan cheesecake.    I don't see myself craving anything on the Green Owl's menu, but it is very nice to go somewhere where I can order anything on the menu.  There is street parking and a lot that appears open after business hours.  Parking can be tricky on weekends.  The service was helpful, friendly, and welcoming."}
{"text":"We had the stuffed red pepper and tamales. They were both fantastic. Service was very prompt."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more than I actually do. I've been a vegan for six years and although Madison has lots of veg options I was excited about an all veg restaurant. However after several visits I've decided that the food isn't anything special. Most menu items lack any real kick and are completely unremarkable. Bland, pedestrian, and kind of mushy.  On the upside Their cocktails are fabulous (but even I can't make a meal out of mixed drinks) and their wait staff is great.  For those looking for truly unique vegan dishes I would recommend any of madison's fine Loa, Thai, or Napali restaurants."}
{"text":"First timer. Been hoping that a place like this existed in Madison. Recently began eating a plant based diet and this restaurant kills it. I'll be back. A lot!"}
{"text":"Traveled to Stoughton last part of July and was in need of a vegetarian meal. From the reviews I had high hopes for The Green Owl, but it was not to be. First starting with the worst of the bad: Service.(or lack thereof) The server acted as if he would rather be anywhere but there. Taking my order seemed a chore. I ordered the krabby kakes as an appetizer. They had a chance to have been good had they not been cold. not room temp, but cold. They were bad because of this. Tartar sauce was nice though no consolation. Before I could finish the cold appetizer, the main course was arriving. Again the server acted as if he could not care less as he pushed my plate over (I suppose I was not quick enough??) and put the plate of epmenadas in front of me. Rice was cold, i had two bites and that was enough. The black beans were cold as well. At least the empanadas were hot. I finished the meal with some french press coffee. This was a sad example of coffee. The water was directly from the tap and luke warm. All around definitely NOT worth the drive from Stoughton, and definitely NOT worth the high price and low service. Going on the Stay Away from list"}
{"text":"From start to finish- our experience was divine!  The soup, entrees and desserts were outstanding!  My non-vegetarian guy did not miss the meat at all.  Green Owl's facebook updates of daily specials look and sound delectable every day!  This restaurant is on the repeat list for sure!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian for over 10 years I was very excited to fall upon this restaurant wandering Madison. My husband, however, is not a vegetarian at all. After we went to have lunch here, I think a switch was turned on for him- vegetarian food can be filling and tasty and I don't need meat at every meal. He loved the Mediterranean appetizer and was had a hard time choosing what to eat for lunch. I mainly enjoyed this because of the enlightening moment my husband had but that is not to take away anything from the fantastic waitstaff, the decor, and the menu."}
{"text":"I had the Italian Beef last Friday afternoon and was already considering going back for another by that evening.  I mean I am totally cheap, but I would pay $20 for that sandwich alone.  My only complaint was that I've tasted much yummier kale crisps in my day.  Luckily the three year old next to me munched the things down after declaring them 'dinosaur chips.'    Oh!  And the orange blossom lemonade is something I would like to have on tap in my home.  Please."}
{"text":"I like this place more every time I visit! I've tried just about everything on the menu and all of it is super tasty and fresh. The kale chips are awesome! Even my non-veg guy is a fan of this place."}
{"text":"We loved the food and  I never thought I would be able to eat biscuits and gravy as a vegetarian. A lack of one star goes to serving carton orange juice instead of \"fresh pulped\".  It may have been freshly pulped, but to us it tasted like Tropicana's orange juice."}
{"text":"It is so nice to find a vegan place to have brunch. It took a while for the wait person to remember we were there, but once she did, she was very friendly. Nice portions and French toast made almost the way I do, although less crusty bread would be easier to eat. Even the coffee was good!"}
{"text":"I went here over this past summer. This is the cutest place! I mean it's so CUTE! I love the decor.   For the very first time in my life I decided to try Kale chips and I am so glad I did it at Green Owl because they were beyond good! I loved them! In fact, I loved them so much that I looked up how to make them on my own. Addicted.  Also, the menu is very creative. I had the bbq Jackfruit Sandwich and it was pretty good. For a minute I forgot that it was jackfruit, and thought hmm something  is different about this sandwich. My fiance was like \"hello it's not pork!!\" Right. haha. I had some sort of lemonade drink too, can't remember exactly what it was but it was yum!  It wasn't the best food of my life but it was good and the atmopshere is nice.  I would go back to Green owl 1.) for the Kale Crisp; 2.) it's so cute; 3.) I'd like to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The service was great, the hostess and our waitress were both pleasant - my water glass was kept full, and empty dishes were promptly bussed away.   I ordered the featured entree that evening, the Spaetzle, which was topped with red bell peppers and a mushroom sauce that also had onions. Tasty, but heavy! I think I would have preferred my boyfriend's meal though; he ordered the (vegan) schnitzel, which came with an identical sauce as mine. I did get to steal a few bites, and it was really tasty. I think my favorite part of the meal was the side salad (house) and side soup (cajun chili).   The place was nicely set up, but crowded - there was a couple on either side of us, close enough to touch without even straigthening my elbow!    Overall, I'd like to head back sometime and try one of the sandwiches instead of an entree. I wouldn't get the spaetzel again, it was just a little too bland."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan find while passing through Madison! The devil wings, TLT & Cajun blackened tofu sandwiches were perfect."}
{"text":"What a terrible restaurant. We waited 30 minutes to be solidly disappointed. Took about 20 minutes after we were seated to be attended. Our food took forever and my friend got the wrong dish. The waitress was somewhat apologetic, and we got a discount on our meal (10%).   The food was nothing special. And it wasn't worth the price. Also the restaurant is very uncomfortable and poorly light. Go to any other restaurant in the neighborhood besides this one."}
{"text":"we are not vegan or vegetarian but enjoy an adventure. We like to eat at Green Owl when we are in the area. The servers can be a aloof but its the neighborhood. The mediterranean plate is my husband's favorite, and he is a total meat eater. I have tried a number of things on the menu and have never been disappointed. Our kids even find food they enjoy. Thanks Green Owl."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I'm thrilled to have a dedicated vegetarian restaurant in Madison, and a block away from my business, no less. It's a great experience to walk into a place and not need to ask about the ingredients in ever dish. Jenny did a great job and the staff is super friendly.  The environment is really enjoyable. They did a great job turning a derelict biker bar into a comfortable restaurant. Lots of reclaimed wood and great personality.  I see a lot of people on here (and others I've talked to) complain about all the \"fake meat\". I'd like to clarify this point a little. To me, \"fake meat\" is when there's an effort to create a processed food that looks and tastes like meat, but isn't. For these items, there will be color added and fake flavors.  At the Green Owl, none of those products are used. Traditional tofu and seitan are marinated and served with house made sauces and dressings. Very rich and flavorful. The menu is presented by referencing meat dishes in the descriptions so that people will understand the preparation of the dish. These are not \"fake meats\".  I tend to get the special of the day, anyway. Always something interesting. The soups are great and the salad bar is a favorite.  I suggest you check out the dessert. Cara is always coming up with something interesting and worthwhile.  My only suggestion would be more all-vegetable dishes that could allow for more of a seasonal focus. But The Green Owl has been a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Green Owl has gotten better and better ever since it opened, and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  Its new menu (just in the last month or so) expands upon its previous solid menu to incorporate some of the specials that have been popular and were worthy of regular status. They've also brought in more entrees that aren't based on fake meat (the expanded variety is nice whether you like the fake meat or not!)  I love having a vegetarian restaurant in Madison in general, but especially one that has such delicious food. Among my favorite dishes are the TLT with Avocado, the Vegetarian Meatball Sub, and the Friday Night Vegetarian Fish Fry. They also have great desserts, with a to-die-for (well, not literally) vegan chocolate cream cake with raspberry puree. And there are still so many things on the menu to try! (My less-favorite items are the Crabby Cake Po'Boy [a little too salty], the BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich [a little too sweet], and the Kale Crisps [a little too dusty]).  I also really applaud the recent featuring of more local produce. There are just too many great producers to not take advantage of this!   Oh and the decor! So charming and colorful.  All in all, I really appreciate the Green Owl, and can't wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"In was sort of skeptical of how this place was actually going to be before walking in for the first time. The outer facade definitely screamed hole in the wall, but upon walking in, we were met with a fairly modern interior, friendly and quick service, and above all, very yummy food.   I had the Middle-Eastern platter (SO good, by the way) and my folks and I shared an order of bread pudding (more like French toast if you ask me), some kale crisps, and a piece of raw Red Velvet \"cake\". And let me tell you, the red velvet was AMAZING. You've never had beets this way before.   The Sunday brunch crowd was pretty busy, but we were still able to get a table and get our food in a fairly reasonable amount of time. Prices weren't the cheapest we've ever seen, but it was definitely worth it. I would absolutely go again. You should too!!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Minneapolis and I'm so glad I found this place! I got the crab cakes burger and buffalo wings and both were so amazing! I honestly think I'm gonna make a couple more trips here and take some food to go because I love it so much. Service was super fast and everyone was really nice and helpful. So thankful for this place! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Second time here, and still a fail. I want SO BADLY to like this restaurant. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find good options at restaurants. However, for me, Green Owl falls flat on flavor and originality.  Last go around, I had the TLT (tempeh instead of bacon) and kale chips. The TLT was just boring to me, and the kale chips too bitter (although, note that I'm spoiled by the chips I make at home).  This go around, I tried the veggie chili and stuffed bell pepper. The chili was full of chunky tomatoes and some onions, but I only found 2 chili beans. The flavor was tomatoey without much spice (if any?). The stuffed bell pepper also had very little flavor, and I couldn't find any almonds or raisins in it (as the menu indicated). It would have been delicious with a variety of different spices, but instead was just another tomatoey-flavored soft mess. My table mates doused their food heavily with salt to make up for the flavor...I couldn't bring myself to add all that msg when some red pepper, cumin, cilantro, ginger, dear-god-anything would really have been amazing!  For those who are vanilla eaters and don't like any sort of spice, this might be your perfect cup of tea. Or, if you're in to all the fake meats--most of the menu options involve fake meats. However, I'd rather eat something that isn't trying to be some meat entree. I'd rather my vegetarian meal stand on its own, as something delightfully yummy for what it is (not what it's trying to be). A focus on vegetables would be a nice touch, too...love my veggies! Vedge restaurant in Philadelphia is fantastic, for comparison...  Oh, Green Owl, good luck...I want to try you and like you. I'll keep an eye on the menu to see if anything changes!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great beverage choices, and an array of yummy vegan options! Immediate seating (indoor/outdoor) and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night with a friend after trying several places nearby that were crowded and had a long wait. We ended up here as a last-resort and I had doubts that the vegetarian-only menu was going to satisfy my palette (I'm very pro-animal but I also crave FLAVAAAA!). This is a very small restaurant and the place was relatively empty. Hmmm... A sign maybe?   TGO is a cute, cozy little place off of Atwood Avenue in a charming neighborhood. When our server greeted us, I was immediately put off by the fact that she was wearing a nose ring. Sorry, but I just don't think that's appropriate in the workplace, especially the service industry (call me old-fashioned!) She was friendly though, offered some suggestions and complimented the chef on his abilities. I felt a little more confident that my meal preparation was in good hands...  When the meal arrived however, my companion and I were both underwhelmed. We ordered the empanadas and schnitzel, respectively. Very bland, no flavor, small portions, and waaay overpriced. It's as if they just threw our dinner together and forgot to add the seasoning and spices. We both left disappointed, which was frustrating considering we had driven around quite a while and worked up an appetite. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for our sandwiches and finally just walked out without eating. Waitress said the kitchen was behind because a table of six had ordered before us. Hint: if a table of six people destroys your ability to serve food, get out of the restaurant business."}
{"text":"This place is great! I am pescatarian, and it is great to find a place where I don't have to compromise. The food is great, and service is really top notch. The prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"All the stuff here IS stuff I would cook for myself, but somehow, it fails.  The sauces on my greens were too cloying. Also, the fake meat had the wrong texture, and there was way too much of it, everywhere on the menu. The spices fall flat, and I think the chef really wants it to taste like \"vegan\" health food. I'm not sure what you do to make that happen, but it did. Mid-meal, I wondered \"Where is the hummus?\"  Above all: none of the entrees are just vegetables.  What?!?!?  Don't be a vegan if you aren't going to eat the veggies.  Little vegan wanting to share their love of vegan food with your friends? Don't bring your friends here, they will think you're gross. (And you will be, that \"pork cutlet\" is going to be in your intestines for a week.) Instead, show them the way with some delicious ethnic food or point out the dish you're getting at whatever restaurant. Or, for garsh sakes, sautee some ish."}
{"text":"The Green Owl is a very welcome asset to the Atwood area and Madison in general.  It's nice, as a vegetarian, to be able to look at a menu and be able to order....everything.  They also have vegan options.  We tried the \"Crabby Cakes\" which are a mushroom & tofu patty with a delicious vegan rémoulade, the BBQ Jackfruit which was extremely tasty, the vegetarian meatball sub which was ok and finished off with their key lime pie which was really tasty as well.  The problem with the meatball sub was that the sauce was a little weak for a tomato sauce and the bread seemed a tad on the cheap side.  The sides we had were kale crisps and roasted potatoes, both of which were good.  Unfortunately they listed Sweet Potato fries but have since removed them from their menu.  They have Blue Sky sodas, Nantucket Nectars and what looked to be a fair beer menu.  I won't say that this is the best all vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to but it does have promise and I'll be a frequent customer.  The service was also excellent to boot.  Some people will probably complain that the bulk of the menu consists of meat alternatives but I personally like seitan and I hear that they have some more menu items in the works."}
{"text":"so.  feeling a little under the weather.  and i just ran the madison mini marathon, even though i probably shouldn't have. (a \"dnf\" is just not this girl's style!)  i'm an out of towner and i'm looking for a vegan meal to share with my man.  we hit up the happy cow app looking for something good.  i'm feeling just side of miserable, not really hungry and concentrating hard just not to barf.  he yells out, \"how about the green owl?\"  he could have said, \"how about hardees?\"  and i'd probably have agreed.  it was that serious.  but we went.  the waitress brought out some awesome iced tea.  some vegan crabby cakes.  my day started to turn around.  my frown?  well.  it started to miraculously turn upside down.  i told my husband i'd have the empanadas.. but i probably wouldn't finish them.  my stomach was doing flip flops.  i'd probably just pick at them.  they came out, and i fucking devoured them.  when the waitress asked if we wanted to have any after dinner sweets, my husband looked at me sympathetically, knowing i probably didn't feel like it.    the waitress said, \"we have vegan coconut cream pie.\"  she had me at hello.  seriously.  forget the fork, bring out a shovel.  i felt good eating it... and then seriously ate myself sick again.  i left knowing i ate really good food, but feeling so ill.  i laid across the backseat of our car in mortal pain.  it wasn't you, green owl.   it was me.    so here's the endorsement:  the food is so good here that you will want to eat it despite the fact that your body is completely wrecked from having the flu, being on some crappy medication, and then having just run a mini marathon.  you will be unable to stop yourself from shoving it in your face!!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, but my wife is. From my non-vegetarian foodie perspective this is really good food in every sense of the word. Started off with some of the mole chili, followed by the BBQ jackfruit. Marvelous layered flavors in both. The jackfruit BBQ satisfied my ever-present longing for pulled pork NC-style. And it came with these great kale chips on the side: freshly made, feather-light. crispy, and lightly salted, and nothing like those widely available rock-hard raw kale chips. Washed it all down with some tasty locally made kombucha (lemon grass, ginger, etc.). They offer many items vegan or non-vegan, if that matters. Some good craft ales and other alcoholic beverages available too, but it was lunch time and I was driving. Nice outdoor seating on a quiet stretch of road. Now I'm looking for some jackfruit here in NY. That BBQ recipe will be mine."}
{"text":"How is this place real? Everything I ate was wonderful and I wish it was in my city. I had the BBQ jackfruit sandwich and the curry salad sandwich (we each got one and split them) and they were both wonderful, and not heavy stomach lumps immediately like most fake meat sandwiches (cough cough Chicago Diner.) Roasted red potatoes on the side were also nicely seasoned. I got the orange blossom lemonade, which was delicious and not too sweet.  For dessert - vegan cheesecake. In general, vegan cheesecake is, sorry, pretty disgusting and weird. But somehow, the Green Owl got the consistency of cheesecake EXACTLY right -- it was smooth and creamy, and delicious! I got the special one that had pineapple and caramel and it was seriously amazing.   The only thing I wasn't super stoked on was the price, but it wasn't too bad; plus, they split the check multiple ways easily and the service was great. Any future trip to Madison will definitely include a stop here for me!"}
{"text":"We had the Krabby cake po-boy and the and the Madison Philly with the with the roasted red potatoes for dessert we had the raspberry cheesecake which was absolutely amazing the food was awesome and the service was great. Definitely come back"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't often write reviews. I tend to write them when I find something or some place either really great or really disappointing. In this case, I'm happy to report that my family and I found this restaurant to be phenomenal.   My son, husband, and I were visiting from out of town and we were looking to keep with our newfound vegan diet. I found \"The Green Owl\" on Yelp. We ordered the raw taco plate as an appetizer. I ordered the groundnut stew, and my husband ordered the buffalo wrap.   The taco plate was good and presented well. It was three lettuce leaves with vegan chorizo, veggies, and spices. I loved the groundnut stew. It was unique and delicious and tasted mostly of peanuts and sweet potato. This particular dish was served on a bed of brown rice with a side of kale. My husband didn't love or hate the buffalo wrap, but was overall happy with it. He did make a comment that the side salad he ordered with it was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the coconut cream pie and the lemon poppyseed cheesecake. The almond crust really hit the spot for me. It wasn't quite as creamy as a normal cheesecake, but that didn't matter too much to me. Both desserts were delicious. My favorite was the cheesecake, though my husband claimed it tasted a bit floury/powdery.   I should also mention that my 18-month old son loved the stew as well. I almost had to order another plate of it just for him.   One other thing of note are the prices. We found them fair even though the portions were smaller than you'd normally see in most American restaurants. My dish was the perfect size for me and my husband didn't complain about his portion either. The food was definitely worth every penny and we left happy, not overly full.  Whether you are a vegan or not, this restaurant is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I hate, I mean _hate_ black beans.  Got the jackfruit quesadillas and they came with a side of black beans.  ZOMG SO GOOD!  So we're the quesadillas!  As was hubbys schnitzel!   Eat here now! (The drinks are also great!)"}
{"text":"The Green Owl is wonderful vegetarian fare close to city center of Madison. When in Madison this is one of my favorite spots to grab a quick and healthy bite. The price is right and the location is easy to get to. As soon as you walk in the aroma of delicious grilled veggies take over and your craving \"whatever they're making in the kitchen\" - definitely recommend for vegetarians and non-vegetarians will enjoy flavors they didn't know."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE the food and the atmosphere is really great too. We all agreed that the food was better then the vegan restaurants in chicago (where were from) don't get me wrong, chicago has some really awesome vegan restaurants but this place is our new favorite.  I ordered the vegan schnitzel and it was so freaking good I wanted to order some more to take home, it's so good that I could easily serve it at a family dinner party and they wouldn't know if it was vegan if I didn't tell them....in which case I would wait till they are heading out the door to tell them and convert them all lol Muahaha! XD jk but also kind of not kidding :} my parents ordered the meatloaf dinner and thier special of the day the vegan fish sandwich both of them were just as impressed as me. For dessert we ordered the mango cheesecake and it was also really great, very light and not overly sweet, perfect. Our teas were really yummy too! All around we decided 10 stars. Great job and thank you so very much, Green Owl Cafe, for serving out if this world vegan food. We will be back asap."}
{"text":"I have been at the Green Owl since its early days and always liked the food there, especially that delicious cheesecake. During my recent visit, however, I noticed that the cheesecake was almost half of the size (still the same price) as that in the early days. I guess it is a common practice in the market place these days - everything is shrinking in size while keeping or increasing price. That was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Good solid vegan food. The entrees seemed on the small side to me, but everything was tasty. The restaurant tends more toward the less healthy end of the vegan spectrum. I call this vegan comfort food, which I really enjoy sometimes. There were not nearly enough vegetables with my food, and adding a pile of vegetables would have made a big difference, both in the size and healthfulness of the meal. The service was friendly, but scattered. Maybe they were having off day. To their credit, they did get me everything I requested. I am visiting from out of town, and I will definitely come back for the good treats, especially the incredible dessert menu. I am vegan and gluten free, and easily met my food needs here."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for vegans and vegetarians alike. Their sandwiches are fresh, tasty, and all around perfect. Their hummus is pretty good too. I enjoyed the Bloody Mary I had as I enjoyed my tempeh sandwich. Every plate around me looked tempting so I'll try something different next time I'm there. The are open until 9pm, at least on Fridays. A place for everyone to find a yummy plate."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that, while many places in Madison are veg-friendly, we only have one vegetarian/vegan restaurant where dishes are guaranteed to be safe from the get-go.  The food here is tasty, though the portions can be a little small.  And though there are a lot of good flavors in the food, the dishes themselves are not that adventurous. As another reviewer said, the menu pretty much consists of meatless versions of meat-based dishes.  More experimentation would be welcome.  The service is always good, though, and that counts for a lot. The staff is always friendly in a way that seems authentic, and they're very good at knowing the menu and also correcting any mistakes that get made in the kitchen. Plus the place feels comfy even when busy.  Plus, I feel like things are much better than when The Green Owl first opened a few years back, so I'm hopeful that they will keep finding their groove."}
{"text":"Yummiest vegan food in Madison  I got the buffalo wings and crab cake burger and both were amazing. Super fast service and everyone was so nice. Thankful this place exists!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and this was recommended to us.   The hostess was pretty rude upon arrival,  but our waitress was great.   We ordered a variety of items and some definitely fell flat.   The crabby po boy is pretty much a soggy veggie pattt and the Buffalo wings are gardein.  Unhappy with those.   On the is side the raw tacos were delicious and the owl nachos were good.   Sesame peanut noodles were overcooked.   The lava cake was amazing and all our drinks were great."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I don't usually like imitation meat products but these were tasty and the restaurant had a nice \"fancy\" vibe to it. The three non-vegetarians I took there seems pleased with their meals and dessert.   I thought the dishes were a reasonably good imitation of meat, but I'm not really a good source for judging that as I've been a vegetarian for over a decade."}
{"text":"Service was poor. The waitress was very nice and funny but it took forever for them to seat us and to get our drinks and food. The bartender noticed us looking her way and asked us we had a question. Then she brought us our drinks when she found out that what we needed. She forgot something with every plate that was placed on our table. The corn bread sucked, the humus was no good. Black bean chili, potatoes, and fish fry were good. The deserts, raspberry cheese cake and smores cake were amazing. All and all, id do it again"}
{"text":"Desserts are outstanding - top notch, as good as I've had.   There are some fairly decent things on the menu, but I really have experienced considerably better food and service at every other vegan/vegetarian restaurant I've been to. No menu item has ever made me want to go back and have it again. The service tends to be extremely slow albeit friendly. The first time I ever went (5 years ago) I had a waitress take my plate away while I was still holding and eating half a sandwich. I've been back many times with many sub-average experiences. Fast forward to this winter: Four employees, four people dining and took almost my entire lunch hour to get our order. Also the portion sizes have always been extremely small in my opinion, especially for the prices.   Summary: don't go if you have time constraints, don't have super high expectations. However, DO get dessert--preferably to go."}
{"text":"I would probably have given this place two stars if not for the friendly staff. We just were not impressed. The menu is entirely vegan/vegetarian, which should be no surprise. Unfortunately, the menu focuses on replacement type dishes instead of embracing vegan/vegetarian options alone. I'd rather just go to another restaurant in town and order the vegan/vegetarian option that come back to this place."}
{"text":"So happy it's here!  This place reminds me of the Chicago Diner, which is impressive for li'l ole Madison.  The menu offers plenty of hearty vegetarian and vegan options, made with real food rather than fake meat,    I had the night's special, shepherd's pie.  The gravy was great - very meat-like, and it featured plenty of tasty, healthy kidney beans.  My friend had the beans and rice dish with steamed kale and miso sauce.  She said it was the perfect dinner after our indulgent yet unsatisfying brunch at Graze earlier in the day.  I wanted to try it, but was afraid I'd have to share some of my meal....  The portion sizes were perfect.  I didn't leave the place feeling like I needed to purge, yet was a happy camper for the rest of the night.    I also had a great spicy Bloody Mary.  It's nice not having to tell the server to keep the beef stick out of my booze in this town.    I look forward to returning and recommend this place to anyone willing to try something new."}
{"text":"This is what a vegetarian restaurant should be. There were so many yummy sounding options that I had trouble choosing. The kale and bean soup was fantastic, I wish I could get it regularly. I had the stuffed red pepper. It came out piping hot and very delicious. My daughter had the vegan schnitzel and loved it.   The service was a bit slow, but was attentive and friendly. If you are in a hurry, let them know. The portions were \"right sized,\" which in today's world can seem a bit small. On the upside, we still had room for dessert, which we loved.   We found The Green Owl on Yelp as we were driving through Madison. We went there for dinner and it will be our \"go to\" restaurant when road trips take us through Madison again."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant but I just don't love it.  Since I am a Veg I will keep coming back and I am sure that I will find some things that I love.  The presentation is beautiful.  The staff is friendly.  I have been there twice now and the food is a bit bland.  But, like I said, I will try again!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday afternoon while driving across America and what a find!  As vegetarian restaurants goes this is first rate.  As all restaurants go... I'd probably be a little more critical.  But you try to make an Italian Beef sandwich out of seitan and see how well it turns out!  So, as a veggie restaurant this is a five star restaurant, easy.  It has a great ambience, with cute indie and indie related music.  An excellent decor and good food.  I had the aforementioned Italian beef which was indeed made out of seitan.  It was spicy if not quite drippy enough, but pretty good.  I found the service to be very pleasant and prompt."}
{"text":"There is a special place in my heart for all vegetarian and vegan restaurants. They are far too rare. This place has a solid menu with enough variety to satisfy a range of tastes and preferences. And the food is well executed. I've gone here both times I've been in Madison the last year and both times have left happy. This last time we started with the wings, which were really good--great texture and flavor. My philly sub was a little underwhelming, but satisfying enough for a lunch sandwich. My husband had the crabby cake po-boy and liked it. Their salads also look really good, but given that I only get here about once a year or less, I'm going for the gold. Maybe they want to open a location in Minneapolis?!"}
{"text":"Outstanding -- I'd eat at the Green Owl every day if I lived in Madison.  The vegan selections were varied and the food was a delight.  Appreciated the friendly service and clean environment.  Even though I was just visiting, I felt at home right away, as if this were a vegan place down the street from me in Chicago."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I loved every minute of it. I had been craving fake chicken wings and they definitely delivered - they were super delicious and came with vegan ranch as well. I was also craving a vegan quesadilla, which they also had. It was perfect. The portion sizes are great for the price! I also had a slice of cheesecake which was incredible."}
{"text":"This place has lead me to write my very first yelp review. Incredible. I've lived in Madison for a long time, and have always been side tracked by The Alchemy. I had the artichoke dip and it was the best I've had in my life. Entrée was the peanut noodle stir fry. Waitress was spot on. No complaints. This place rules."}
{"text":"Did we drive an hour from Milwaukee to stay in Madison primarily to try this restaurant? Maybe :).   Cutest place from the outside, and very quaint and cozy inside. Decorated to the max with owl statues, pictures, figurines, and pretty wood and kelly green walls. We came at about 7:00 on a  Tuesday and had a twenty minute wait, which we spent at the bar. We noticed all of the liquors they make themselves and I was so tempted to get a cocktail! We were finally seated a bit after 7:30. They were super short staffed- it's a small place, so there was one waitress and one bartender/waitress.   The menu is pure glory for a vegetarian/vegan. We started with the Devil Wings; TOLY TOLEDO they were phenomenal. The texture of the \"nuggests\" was so chicken-y and it shredded just like real chicken. The sauce was authentic buffalo, spicy and vinegary. 10/10 for those fantastic wings!  We ordered three sandwiches to try (yes, we took a bunch home!). The Madison Philly with seitan. A great hearty sandwich, but I have had more flavorful phillies. 7/10. The cajun blackened tofu sandwich was really delicious. The lemon blackened tofu cutlet was very flavorful and we loved the toasty ciabatta roll. 8/10. Now the best for last! The Southwest Filet sandwich. Sounds boring, right? WRONG! The breaded unchicken filet had the most fantastic texture and flavor. When we were still eating meat, we used to love \"chicken on a stick\" from Chinese takeout restaurants. Well, they hit the nail on the head with this unchicken filet. We adored the flavor and the texture. This sandwich was definitely a 9/10!  For the sides, we had the roasted potatoes, crispy kale, and quinoa salad. The BF said the quinoa tasted \"like barf. The kale was super crispy, spicy, but a tad too salty. The roasted potatoes were delicious and perfect with some herbs and spice.  We will absolutely be coming back to try the rest of the menu because it is so tempting. The jambalaya, schnitzel, and desserts are waiting for us to try!"}
{"text":"cool place, came in to chill a bit before my hair appointment next door. Great service, I ordered a chaitini (yummy 5/5) and kale crisps (also really yumbo). The reason why I'm not calling this a 5 is because there was not exceptional about this place? Would recommend going here but not somewhere where I'm like \"GOTTA GET MY KALE CRISPS, GET MY FIX MANNN\"."}
{"text":"I agree with a couple of other reviewers that I wish this place were not so focused on meat-substitute foods, and would have more of a variety of vegetables and grains on their menu rather than soy/wheat-based fake meat. I also agree that the prices are rather high considering that much of the food is homey/sandwich-y fare, with small portions at that.  That said, I'm very happy to see a vegan/veggie place in Madison doing so well! The food is pretty good (I've gotten the tempeh/avocado/lattuce/tomato sandwich with those crispy yummy kale chips), though I wasn't in love with the dessert my friend ordered us (some kind of vegan cheesecake, which I knew was a mistake from the beginning)."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian and vegan food! My new absolute favorite restaurant! love that everything is vegetarian or vegan and wonderful atmosphere. Love the building and decor- just love everything here :)"}
{"text":"Hey.  If I can take my carnivorous Mister here and he can leave satisfied, you know they're doing something right.  True story.    Being a veg, it's such a treat to get to peruse the WHOLE menu and not have to play the \"scan-the-menu-for-something-that-doesn't-say-fish-or-chicken-or-beef-and-settle for-that\" game.  And everything I've had here has been good.  Sandwiches are in the $8-9 range and are each served with a side.  Upgrade to a bowl of soup, which I'd definitely recommend - all the soup I've tried here has been delish. Entrees are pricier, but nothing outrageous at $11-13 and each comes with a soup or salad. They seemed to be in the process of re-doing their drink menu (which is good, they're adding descriptions which is nice) and things were averagely priced ($4ish for beers, $6ish for mixed drinks, etc.).  The Bloody Mary I had last time was thick (good) and a bit overly peppery for my taste, but maybe you'd like it...   Staff & service have been consistently good when I've been here, every time I chat with them about recommendations and they genuinely seem to love the food and want to tell you what they like and why... I appreciate some good honest opinions!  BOTTOM LINE:  Cheerfully painted, well-lit, friendly staff, and  good food..,. definitely a place to check out, vegetarian or not!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why the two-three star reviews of disappointed palates and deflated wallets share the same webspace as the five-star reviews that seem to feature broken capslock buttons, and read like they're taken out of an eBay customer satisfaction survey:  You have to know what you're getting into when you come here.  As the proprietor herself put it, The Green Owl seeks to: \"...Please vegetarians and vegans--both those who gave up eating meat long ago and those who sometimes still miss it--as well as meat-eaters who eat out with their vegetarian/vegan family members and friends.\"  Being Chinese, I'll proceed to do the math for you (and enjoy it!) as to what follows logically from that mission statement:   Food: This restaurant is in no way a celebration of vegetarianism, veganism, or what distinct flavor profiles or textures vegetables themselves can offer.  Whereas Asian cultures, all with a high level of Buddhist influence, celebrate the many variations of tofu like Westerners celebrate cheese (there is popular franchise restaurants in China featuring Buddhist cuisine; all tofu, all the time), this place is expressly trying to make vegetation derived proteins and fibers resemble meat.  In that respect, you can expect your \"sloppy joe\" or \"fish sandwich\" to undergo a bit more processing than a meat-based equivalent, to achieve the same desired goal.  Kind of analogous to how much makeup a drag queen needs to put on, in comparison to someone who is female to begin with; in our case, well the flavor just depends on if you notice the eggplant's Adam's apple or not.  Money: All that vegetable makeup doesn't come cheap!  The irony is never lost on the Engineer in me that even though there's a roughly 10:1 conversion of pounds vegetation to pounds of meat, you can end up paying so much more for the vegetable \"equivalent\" (debatable, see above.).  Atmosphere: If you're a vegetarian or vegan, you've probably already noticed that there tends to be a bit more malnourished rhetorical bravado within your demographic (skinny hipsters).   You're going to get those here.  In fact, you will probably be seated next to one, and he will probably be having a very opinionated conversation with himself (that his \"friends\" are forced to listen while they wonder why they bothered to go to dinner with this guy anyway) about why the wine this place serves isn't as baseball-glove-flavoured as another vintage.  I'm almost exaggerating, but this guy ruined my appetite more than the food ever could.  Desserts: These babies deserve a separate section all their own.  Thankfully many desserts may use animal-based products, but at least they don't need to feature them.  In that respect, this place really shines for desserts.  Anything off of the dessert menu can stand in its own right, and there is no noticeable flavor nor texture difference between the vegetarian and vegan offerings.  They are also tastier and more unique than many offerings I've had at slightly more \"upscale\" foodie establishments in Madison.  Hell, I think this place may receive better reviews if it just became a completely vegan dessert shoppé.  Director's Cut: My opinions of this location are tempered with the fact that I was a vegetarian for two short, hungry years, and I did it out of stubbornness for my best friend, who was one for most of her life, out of sheer love for animals (took me to a county fair, made me hug a piglet, told me to think about him whenever I wanted bacon). In that respect, I disliked this place, seeing its menu offerings as an affront to my stubbornness.  At the same time, stubbornness can only last so long, and this place was absolutely amazing to my bestie, who's spent much, much longer than I have walking by every other brat and burger joint Madison has to offer.  So there you have it, take a look at the menu ahead of time, try not to be disappointed by the obvious, cross your fingers that you'll be pleasantly surprised, and if all else fails, jump straight to the dessert!"}
{"text":"Dear vegan schnitzel, let's have a baby together.    Seriously.  I'm not a vegan.  I'm not even a vegetarian, but I really enjoyed the schnitzel at Green Owl.  The serving was on the small side, but seriously America, the serving sizes you get at most restaurants are TOO BIG.  I did not leave hungry, especially since the schnitzel comes with veggie, roasted potatoes, and either a soup or house salad.    Boyfriend got the crabby cake po' boy, which he enjoyed.  He also pounded down his fair share of a vegan chocolate cake.  I thought the cake was a little too dense, but I'm not usually a chocolate cake gal.  The frosting was nice though.    They have an interesting beer selection at good prices, but luckily for me, I decided to pass on the booze and try the orange blossom lemonade.  It was heavenly.    I love the decor and all the cute little owls.  Hipsters would swoon."}
{"text":"I visited here on my first visit to Madison, St. Patrick's Day actually---appropriate...GREEN owl, get it? So anyway I had the Tofu Scrambler with red potatoes, and my boyfriend got the French Toast. I was impressed with both! I actually never like French toast and I loved this one...  I also had a French press of the Just Coffee-- very cool that they serve that, and have their own Green Owl roast too.  The ambiance was nice, too, nice and casual and hip, but the prices were high for the ambiance and neighborhood.  Also my waitress seemed so hip that she couldn't bother being friendly. Great food though, greeeeat fooooood."}
{"text":"If we ever come back to Madison we will definitely go back to the Green Owl café. Just awesome schnitzel not to mention the best Vegan Wings ever."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious. My TLT was simply a great sandwich. Kale chips were crisp and flavorful. Oh, and beer was only $3 on special. Also, wait staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Green Owl in about a year, was looking forward to a tasty if somewhat pricey meal, for a minor celebration with a couple of friends. We all found it disappointing. The nachos, which used to be copious and delicious, were in a smaller quantity, very stingy on the cheese, and without any salsa!!?? There is a small menu, maybe half a dozen entrees, and the first two (suggested by the friendly server) turned out to be out! Maybe better coordination between the kitchen and servers is needed, not to speak of keeping your dishes available (we were there quite early, were told there was a lunch rush--but that left plenty of time to restock). The pasta dish I did order was fairly tasteless, as were my friends' dishes. Madison's only vegan restaurant should be better--maybe they need some competition."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here last night.  I had the veggie loaf dinner and the turtle cheesecake for dessert.  While not a comprehensive review, since I've only had one entree here thus far ,  I will return.  Only slight negative is the atmosphere - not the most appealing but it didn't matter much to me as I was content to simply enjoy my food."}
{"text":"I got the Campanelle Alfredo. I was worried it would be bland and flavorless (like many vegan dishes I've had before) however I was shocked by how delicious it was. Even non-vegans would love this and not be able to tell it was vegan."}
{"text":"This is the place.  Love the food, the helpful wait staff, the reasonable prices, the creative menu.  Can't believe you can eat such a delicious and varied menu at a vegetarian place.  Working my way through the menu, routinely distracted by specials, disappointed when they run out of something I didn't get to try.   Selfishly want to keep this a secret but...well....Go ahead, eat there."}
{"text":"I spent my birthday dinner at The Green Owl last night, and it did not disappoint!    There was a short wait, but we ended up eating at the bar which meant enjoying the good company of the great bartenders and waiters.  I loved their selection of homemade vodka infusions, and I enjoyed a cocktail made from chai vodka and coconut  milk.  Delicious!  All of the food we tried was amazing, from the crab cake appetizers to the schnitzel (vegan schnitzel?!?) to the TLT.  My only complain was that the kale chips were super dry and flavorless, but that's pretty minor since I didn't go there for the kale chips.  We also loved their great selection of desserts, and it was a nice touch for the waiter to bring me a glass of soy milk to go with my chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"I left a meeting starving. Hopped in my rental car, fired up yelp, found this and read a review about a yummy crab po-boy. I thought yum! I love crab. I didn't read the rest and drove straight there.  I get there, and ah ha! It's Vegan! Not a crab po-boy after all. Waaamp Waaaaaa.  But...so, so delicious. I had the TLT (i think), an awesome raspberry tart and really delicious coffee.  Will be back next time in Madison."}
{"text":"The mole jackfruit burrito tasted just like pulled pork and they added dairy cheese per my special request! Our crabby cake app was extremely tasty. I also loved the martini mixed with home made herb infused vodka. They were so nice to our kids and brought out a box of toys and plastic owl cups."}
{"text":"Jackfruit sandwich = cat food & pickles.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Searching for a vegan restaurant in Madison shouldn't have been such a challenge. (Yelp, you need to step up your game.) Calling a friend in California who grew up in Madison resulted in a recommendation from his sister who still lives here.  I'd hoped to find something close to my hotel (The Edgewater), and while the Green Owl wasn't in walking distance on this snowy, windy Spring evening, the short drive was well worth the effort.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Get the TLT with avocado - you won't be disappointed! I ate there once while visiting the area and it was great. I wish I had been able to try more offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"God I love this place.  This time I had un-chikn parm with daiya (yummmmmmmmm). The garlic bread could have been more, well you know, garlicky.  I like me some fresh garlic on my bread.  Salad was delish.  BF had ital seitan sandwich. very good although he was still hungry. He said he expected more seitan on the 'wich. I was refreshed by the arny palmer. soooooo good.  you are still pleasing me!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food, that I think even an omnivore might appreciate. I brought my kids, so I'm glad they had the option of real cheese on their french bread pizza (which was very good). We got the vegetarian BLT, which was outrageously fantastic, and the blackened tofu sandwich, which was very tasty, too."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the menu options and that everything is able to be vegan! Delicious bloody. The buffalo wrap was perfect for lunch. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"Vegans and non-vegans alike can rejoice in this brightly-decorated cafe and order pretty much anything off the menu with the assurance that it will be a mouth-watering endeavor.   We ordered the vegetarian chili with cornbread, Santa Fe salad, and the \"fish\" fry special which comes with a side of your choice. Though the fish fry was excellent, my favorite of the three was the Santa Fe salad - it came perfectly dressed in a savory cilantro lime dressing, with generous slices of avocado. The chili was surprisingly flavorful. In all cases, there was a great attention to spices; it's one of the reason why I like vegan/vegetarian cafes since they seem to have this in common.   The wait staff is fully knowledgable about the food. I asked if there was flour in the \"fish\" fry breading and I got a run down of the ingredients in both the vegan and vegetarian options - indicating the staff is fully prepared to engage in and anticipate any specific dietary needs.   Dessert was a slice of vegan-friendly mango cheesecake. There were splashes of ginger, lime, and mint. It tastes just like cheesecake, minus the heavy feeling of swallowing a brick of butter and cream cheese.   Coffee is excellent, it comes in an individual serving-size french press."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Green Owl since following them on Facebook for probably about a year now. I am always intrigued by their delicious-sounding specials and appetizing food photography. So when planning a day trip to Madison, I knew right away where I wanted to go for dinner.  My boyfriend and I started with cocktails. I got their lavender infused gin and lemonade and it was divine! After reading other reviews we decided to order the crab cakes as an appetizer. Thanks for the tip, yelpers! The crab cakes were rich in flavor and the unexpected spiciness complimented them perfectly! I don't think I could go back without ordering them again!    For dinner, I order the bbq jackfruit sandwich with kale crisps and my boyfriend ordered the fish fry. I absolutely loved my sandwich. The bbq sauce was delicious and coleslaw was very good too. I was underwhelmed by the kale crisps, but probably just because they were hyped up so much on other reviews. My boyfriend liked his fish fry, but the fish filets were rather small and didn't look homemade. The tartar sauce was out of this world though!  I can't wait to go back! The guy next to us had the Italian beef and GD, that looked and smelled great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place... this was our first time here and I plan to return often.  I'm a vegan, or should say trying my best to stay vegan which is a challenge when eating out.  The jackfruit bbq sandwich was awesome (and this coming from a gal who used to live in Memphis and knows real bbq.)  And I love faux meat dishes. The tamarind hot and sour soup makes my mouth water thinking about it now as I write this.  I'll keep this short... go there, it's great.  Also, nice decor, nice wait staff, even the restroom was pretty."}
{"text":"VEGAN HEAVEN!!!!!!   One word to describe The Green Owl Cafe - WOW!   Wow, way to impress vegans with dishes one would typically expect omnivores and carnivores to eat.   Wow, way to have great service and prepare your dishes in a timely manner.   Wow, thanks for allowing me to realize how great Madison, WI is.   If there weren't so many other restaurants with vegan options that I wanted to try in Madison, I would have returned back to the Green Owl Cafe to try breakfast!   I really appreciate the passion behind the menu of offering dishes to please vegans instead of bore vegans because every person deserves a great dining experience without feeling limited to what the menu has for them to eat.   The Green Owl Cafe is definitely a hip environment located near lots of other restaurants and a few small stores to shop at! The vibes and really chill and it's a happy place to be!   Check out the Green Owl Cafe to try to convince the significant other in your life that being a vegan doesn't entail boring food! ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing. French toast and cinnamon rolls for brunch and it blew my mind. Will return to try the Vegan Nuevo Ranchero."}
{"text":"I travelled to Madison on business and could not convince anyone from my group to come with me (daw, really I wanted a party for 1, I needed some quality time with myself).  After a couple of attempts at getting a vegan meal -- which sometimes people think is whatever dish someone else would eat minus the meat and dairy -- Green Owl delivered a complete, delicious dinner that didn't leave me depleted. It was the best meal I had during my trip.  Green Owl was recommended to me by a friend, and reinforced by the hotel guy who drove me over.   Big honking YES to this restaurant!   Being a sometime-mostly-tryingtobe vegan, but also a dairy intolerant person, I am always delighted and overwhelmed when I can try anything and everything on the menu.   I went on instinct: Curry melt with vegan cheese, side of kale crisps, a glass of kombucha (they rotate flavors, and it is locally made, and very very good), also packed up a vegan mango cheesecake because I never get to eat cheesecake. It was so amazing, all of it.   Service was great, place was clean and had little touches like the owl perched by the back window and really cool light fixtures. I felt satiated, happy, and impressed, and far happier with this meal than the expensive must-try steakhouse downtown.   I highly recommend this restaurant. I give no hoot if you are wary of vegan fare, give this place a try. I will make every attempt to return on future trips to Madison."}
{"text":"The worst thing about this place (aside from the fact it's 2.5 hours from where I live) is deciding! There are so many great options. I landed on the Peanut Macro Bowl, which was delicious. I wish there was a bit more for the price!   The place is cute with a small outdoor space, and the service was friendly and attentive. I may have to find a reason to go to Madison again soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of vegan/vegetarian food in general, but I think this place has a really cool concept.  I really like how they emulate popular meat dishes from a vegan perspective like Un-chicken Parmesan, Vegetarian Italian Beef and BBQ Jackfruit.   They also have an extensive and interesting drinks menu, involving very unique mixes like ginger beer and Kombucha.   I got a Bonfire (specialty drink), Bedlam and Vegetarian Italian Beef with a side of crispy kale.    Personally, I didn't enjoy my Vegetarian Italian Beef that much, just because I love real meat too much. However, everything else was good, especially the kale.  This was definitely an unique experience, but I'm not sure if I'll be back just because this isn't really my scene."}
{"text":"A great selection of vegetarian/vegan food that's very reasonably priced!   Tried their tofu scramble and mock patty/vegan cheese breakfast sandwich! Both were interesting and hit the spot.  It's a refreshing meal which you won't feel like you over eat or feel bloated on a Sunday morning!   Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Kale crisps are delish, but the philly sandwich was a bit lacking in substance. If you aren't vegetarian or vegan, and you just want to try something new, maybe go for the real stuff instead."}
{"text":"Everything about The Green Owl is excellent. Both the host and server were really friendly, and I ended up ordering one of the sandwiches on special--I can't remember what it was called but it was a mixture of seitan and portabella complete with strips of cucumber, shreds of carrots, slices of jalapenos, and smothered in a delicious sauce. The roasted red potatoes on the side were perfectly cooked and seasoned.   I really appreciated that the menu clearly designated which options were vegan, and it was so nice to be able to have soymilk in my coffee in an establishment other than a coffeehouse.   In addition, the decor is beautiful. I can't do it justice with a description, so I'll just say that it was the perfect fusion between clean and modern and natural. If you're in the Madison area, you have to check out The Green Owl Cafe!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in WI... Heck, anywhere.  A vegan paradise!!!  Love the food, the atmosphere... we've met some friends here as well.  The TLT (Tempeh, lettuce, tomato) sandwich is amazing.  I have yet to try anything I didn't like a LOT, including coconut cream pie... mmm... pie :) - ONLY drawback for me is that the coffee comes in a french press...  I love coffee, hate french presses.  For vegetarian dining in WI this is as good as it gets! :)"}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had here is delicious, it's all local and the dishes are creative (Beeramisu instead of tiramisu?! Hell yes). The drink menu is wonderful is well. My favorite Atwood place and the best vegan restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty. I love the vegan fish fry sandwich they serve on Saturdays. The TLT is also very good and brunch is fantastic. I only wish they also had some brunch items available on Saturdays or at least a breakfast menu. Sometimes it would be nice to have waffles or pancakes on Saturdays. Service is great and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I am a vegan and a celiac so eating out is very difficult. I love coming to The Green Owl because I have a choice. There are so many good options that it is hard to figure out what to have. I have attached a picture of the special which was a vegan fish fry. it was vegan and they had a Gluten-Free option. It was so yummy and affordable! They even make their own Gluten-Free bread and it was yummy! If you are in Madison, you must try The Green Owl bring your carnivore and omnivore friends. You will love it!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about GOC.  We had our first \"taste\" tonight and I must enthusiastically agree with the positive reports!  We will definitely return and recommend to the GOC!  Now after several visits ... Still five stars!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, nor do I have celiac's disease, but since the Green Owl caters to these needs, it has been a fantastic gathering place for a few of my friends and me. Green Owl's menu is both veg and vegan friendly, and they take care to avoid gluten contamination. I personally love the jackfruit quesadillas - they are served with the Green Owl sauce - which is made locally in Madison by Dashelito's. The staff is outstanding as well. My water glass was never empty and when I asked for extra Green Owl sauce, our sweet waitress brought me the bottle for the table to share. The kindness they show to their people and the compassion they express for animals makes Green Owl a joyful experience. I'm grateful to have a great Vegan restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"I wish there were more vegan places like Green Owl in Madison. This is Madison for goodness sake, why don't we? I'm not talking about salad bars, but hearty vegan food.   We started with the buffalo wings which were like chicken nuggets in buffalo sauce. They didn't seem home-made but they were meaty and chewy. A little too chewy but I've never tried faux chicken nuggets before so I'm not sure how they'd compare to other brands.   My friend ordered the peanut noodle dish with tempeh. It was good but you could get that anywhere.   The star of the dinner was my cheese quesadilla with jackfruit. Green Owl has eggs and real cheese on the menu that they will change for tofu or vegan cheese. I substituted real cheese for vegan Daiya cheese. If you're a vegan that misses real bbq pulled pork with cheese, please get this. It tasted so real.   The servings were all generous and the prices were extremely reasonable, comparable to getting the food at any other restaurant. I'll be sure to go back and get other things like their vegan meatloaf."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here.  My first time was when it first opened and there was not a whole lot to write home about. Tonight it was fantastic! To begin with, service was a little slow.  It took about 5 min for our server to come and another 10 to get our cocktails.  But she was super nice and apologetic and the tasty drinks made up for it.  My man and I both got the special drink, a ginger snap, which contained yahara bay vodka, ginger liquer, lemon and lemon-lime soda. To start with I got the black bean chili topped with cheddar and sour cream, although vegan versions of both are available.  It was really really good!  For the main event, I got the faux fish fry, which I have been dying to try.  i was definately NOT disappointed, it was excellent!  It came with 2 \"fish\" patties, rosemary red skinned potatoes and coleslaw, plus my chili, for $12.  I will definately come back for it, again and again.  My man got the bowl of chili, which he loved, a side of potatoes (really good) and a side of hummus, which was not very good... It didn't seem to have any garlic in it at all and just tasted... dirty.  But everything else was awesome. Our food was soooooo good that we had to try dessert.  He got a smore dessert, which was a dense chocolate cake topped with a flambeed marshmallow fluff.  I haven't been able to have marshmallow in years, so that was a real treat!  I got raspberry cheesecake, which did not disappoint!  I am really happy with almost everything about this trip and will definately be back for the \"fish.\" again!"}
{"text":"I want to thank The Green Owl for introducing me to the concept of vegan nachos. Vegan \"cheese\" is usually pretty gross but somehow when its made into a warm, melty sauce and paired with black beans and avocado it is COMPLETELY transformed into a creamy, delicious alternative. This is majorly important as cheese is my ultimate vice - I like cheese on my salad, cheese on my pasta, cheese on my cheese - and now I have a way of eating cheese without eating cheese. THANK YOU GREEN OWL, FOR SAVING ME FROM MYSELF.  Also, great cocktails."}
{"text":"Perfect place for vegans! Delicious food, yummy drinks, no straws in the water (I'm no waste so it matters to me!). Cute place too. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not a vegetarian or a vegan and I love owl decor.  I have wanted to go here for quite awhile and after reading reviews on here I was intrigued to see what type of experience I would have. It turns out that most of the reviews are true and it just depends on what you get and who your waiter is.   I got the Crabby Cake Po'Boy with the kale chips. The crabby cake itself was pretty good but the sandwich as a whole was not spectacular. The chipotle sauce was overly hot without the flavor spicy things should have in addition to the heat and the sandwich was mushy. I understand the lack of meat makes things a little less textured but adding a large leaf of romaine lettuce or slices of cucumber would have added a much needed crunch to the sandwich. As for the kale chips, they were very salty, which was elevated by the fact that we never got a water refill and because of that I couldn't make it through my entire side of salty kale chips.  The comments about portion are true, the dishes are pretty small and because of that, I do think the prices are a bit too much but the vegetarian I went with absolutely loved her fake meatball sub made with eggplant. We both agreed that the sandwiches are good (mine would have been a lot better with the added fresh veggies!), the sides are not good (she got the potatoes which were not very good), and the service could have been better. I agree with the other people who said it is odd that they don't use very much veggies and all of the bread is white...they should embrace being a healthy vegetarian/vegan a little bit more and focus more on veggies and less on meat substitute."}
{"text":"OH GOD THE CRAB CAKES  I've seen them on a few vegan menus before but never tried them until I went to Green Owl. My lady and I ordered them as appetizers and I probably could've just had crab cakes for dinner all night. Instead - I opted for the \"fish\" fry, after all it was Friday, and I still drool a little bit when I see the two words. I regret that decision, unfortunately. The fish there seems store bought - a perfect patty made into the vague shape of a fish. I can do store bought at home, but from a semi-famous vegan restaurant it was rather disappointing. My advice: get the crab cake sandwich - like I will the next time I go back.  Other notes: - Interior is cool. Beautiful photos of happy animals and brightly painted walls. - Staff likes to hang out at the bar like they are drinking at the bar. Kinda weird. - Drinks are slightly pricey but tasty."}
{"text":"On a road trip to Madison, we ate here multiple times in two days. Really spectacular."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, a vegan/vegetarian restaurant should come naturally but I've been to a surprising few I was not a fan of for one reason or another - this is not the case with Green Owl.  Service - Always pretty good with pretty minimal slow-downs. Food arrives promptly.  Prices - Prices seem fair in general although some appetizers seem too high(like Crab Cakes are tiny for a big price). Maybe it's not the portion size that matters but its the first thing you see.  Foods - I'd say this is one of the largest variations when it comes to Green Owl.. its very possible to get something you don't like or like a lot if you try something new. I don't say that in a bad way but some of the recipes are pretty varied and not \"safe\" for everyone. For instance - the Kale Crisp side was not something I'd like(I'm sure some people out there might like it). But for the rare things I don't like, there is a lot I've come to love such as the \"meatball\" sub, italian \"beef\", faux fish stuff and others. I think that is what I really enjoy about the Green Owl is they are constantly offering new things daily while maintaining a very interesting menu. There is still a lot I want to try there.  Special Bonus - I'd say the Green Owl has my favorite Bloody Marys although, strangely, lacking in the \"toppings\" department.. if they had Celery & Pickles they'd probably easily be my favorite overall Bloody Mary but the liquid/mix/vodka is absolutely heavenly. Try it !"}
{"text":"My brother is a vegan, and he was delighted to have a full menu to peruse. (\"Now I know why my friends take so long to order,\" he said, while I imagined him mournfully ordering a salad at every joint.)   I'm not part of The Green Owl's target audience, but I thought everything was pretty decent. The portions were filling, the prices were reasonable, and the Madison Philly tasted pretty good. I was satisfied, if not exuberant. If my brother had a yelp account, I'm sure he'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"So, the husband and I decided to start our Wednesday feasting with a very nice walk to The Green Owl. This fine vegan/vegetarian establishment is a gem on the end of the more populated, area of Madison, closer to the industrial area. But don't be a dud, check this place out. Our server was very sweet. We started with two Crabby Cakes, crisp, crab-like cakes, complete with dippin' sauce. I opted for a house kombucha and the husband got a cow-themed beer. We split a reuben and Italian beef sandwich with roasted potatoes and kale crisps. Sooo good! We polished our meal off with a slice of spicy chocolate \"cheese cake\" that was made with coconut milk. We were silent, as we tend to be during orgasmic food moments. My only suggestion: make the meals a bit bigger. Just a tad. I think being from Chicago left us wanting a little more, but overall, the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Dined here at supper time. Wait for nachos was almost an hour & the order came out wrong. Food tasted good, but based on my lactose intolerant partner's stomach ache upon completion, we question if the initial wrong order contained dairy, which would not have been a problem if the order had been correct. I like the concept & menu items but the measly nachos were not worth $10.50. The server also should have warned us about the wait time & checked on us without our prompting knowing we waited so long for the food."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood from Willy street and we're right behind The Green Owl which we were super excited about.  Visited for brunch on Sunday around 12:30pm and it wasn't too busy.  I ordered the Paloma cocktail and it was great. Love a good fresh summer drink!   For food I had the Izzy's salad with feta cheese and it did not disappoint. Salad was really fresh with crisp veggies and a light vinaigrette dressing. Comes with either feta or lemon tofu and I can't wait to try the tofu next time! Overall everything was delicious, service was good and I'm excited we now live around the corner."}
{"text":"Great homey food and atmosphere.  I had the quinoa stuffed red pepper which was flavorful and filling.  We had a very friendly server and the restaurant atmosphere is very cozy and comfortable.  The only downside was that there was a pretty long wait for the food.  We received our salad and kale chips along with our meal, although it would have made more sense to get those first to make the wait for the food less significant.  I would recommend to vegetarians and non-vegetarians who are looking for a healthy and flavorful meal."}
{"text":"Good Food, not just good Vegan Food.  Lunch for four as my daughter was leaving for a month to go overseas.  We picked the Green Owl as being both convenient and vegetarian, meeting our two most important criteria of the day.  What we got was also delicious.  As a meat eater, I am often disappointed by the food at vegetarian/vegan restaurants.   Basically they seem to assume that they get points for being vegan. Blech.  Not at the Green Owl.  I have to say, I would be happy to bring anyone there, and expect to be served food that pleases all palates.    All four meals were fine, but by consensus the eggplant meatball sandwich was the winner.  Really good, I mean better than most meatballs you get anywhere else good.    I will say service was slow, and it was not particularly packed (3/4 full?).  Prices were not high, but not cheap for lunch either - 10 to 13 is pricier than most places.  It was for those two reasons that I gave the Green Owl four stars rather than five.  The cinnamon roll cheesecake loved by the three ladies - myself I found the cinnamon to much, but I will concede I am not a huge fan of it.    I look forward to returning.

{"text":"VEGAN food!!!! I was in the area and had to google some place to eat. Now I had had friends come to Madison before and they said it wouldnt be too hard to find vegan options. So glad they were right! A simple google search brought up this vegetarian/vegan cafe.   It seems to be located in a pretty good area, lots of other restuarants, bars and little shops around. I felt safe and intrigued by the area. Parking was fairly decent and free on the street in front of the cafe. A big colorful sign makes it easy to find the place.   Inside is cute. It is a bit small and narrow, intimate I will say. I was greeted right away. I sat at the small bar area to explore the menu, as I was ordering to go. The menu overall looks pretty tastey with a good choice of healthy and comfort foods. There are drinks, daily specials and desserts!   Food was timely and a decent price. Staff was pleasant and even helped me with locating other nearby restaurants with vegan food that was worthwhile to check out.   I ended up getting the following for $30: 1. Orange blossum lemonade: so good!! 2. Wings: buffalo sauce was really good, Im a wimp and definitely needed a drink, but yum and the ranch was tastey. They come in a strange little patty form, but good. I ordered them again on my visit the very next day.  3. Philly: pretty decent, the bread was oh so chewy and I really enjoyed the sandwhich overall.  4. Caramel cheesecake: yup, yum!  5. Side of potatoe and gravy: this was okay, nothing special. 6. Side of kale chips: decent, not my favorite thing but I wanted to give them a shot.    Anyways, very happy with my visit. I stopped by on Thursday early afternoon and it was empty. I stopped back for more on Friday afternoon and it was packed. Definitely recommend it and will return next time I am in the area!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here on the way through Madison.  We decided to get lunch here at about 2 in the afternoon because we were hungry and had heard about how good this place is.  We were quickly astonished how good this place is.  First, the decor, albiet kitschy was pretty well done and fit with the theme of the restaurant's name.  I don't normally go to vegetarian/vegan only places, but I would go here all the time if this place existed close to home.  The food was freaking amazing.  I started off with the in-house-made orange blossom lemonade.  WOW!!!  Not overly done with the orange blossoms, but it was a major component.  A++ on that!  Then, I ordered the TLT w/ Avocado while my girlfriend ordered the Jackfruit BBQ sandwich.  Both were freaking amazing, although I liked the tempeh on the TLT better than the jackfruit.  I think that's just a preference.  I actually thought the vegan TLT was better than a BLT with Neuske's bacon.  I am out of my freaking mind!  It was SOOOOO good.  I had the side of roasted potatoes, and while they were quite good, I should have went with the kale chips like my companion did.  Those were delicious as well.  We followed up with a dessert of some sort of fresh, vegan, raspberry tart with \"ice cream\".  The \"fake\" ice cream and \"fake\" whipped cream topping were amazingly good, and I didn't know they weren't \"real\".  Mind you, I've had some preconceptions about vegan food, and The Green Owl has squashed them all.  Vegan food can be AMAZING if done in the right way by the right chefs.  A+++++ I will be stopping here pretty much anytime I drive through Madison."}
{"text":"Shame on you, Green Owl.  As the only (?) vegetarian restaurant in Madison, you really seem to rely on that to bring people in, rather than your food.  While I enjoyed my entree (the meatloaf sandwich), my side of crispy kale (which I had to pay extra for) arrived as a charred pile of powder.  How dare you let that out of the kitchen, let alone serve it to a paying customer?  And why/how are your desserts so awful?  I generally will seek out/pay more for vegan desserts, as I find them to taste better than conventional desserts...and there are plenty of vegan bakeries out there to support this claim.  My coconut cream pie was a pile of coconut, on top of a tasteless white paste, and appeared to have been shaped into a triangle to resemble a pie slice.  Service was bad, but it appeared to be just our waitress.  I didn't know there were specials (until I overheard the other servers telling their tables), and the worst is that on the back of the dessert menu was the Friday fish fry special, which I totally would have ordered had I known about it (yes I was there on a Friday night).    My suggestions: - Have 1 or 2 \"non-weird\" options, so carnivores feel comfortable joining their vegetarian dining companions here.  Something along the lines of a \"normal\" pasta, mexican lasagna, etc where they wouldn't miss the meat.   - Servers need direction.  I didn't appreciate seeing my waitress walk out of the kitchen chewing a mouthful of food while I sat at my table waiting for food. - The dessert menu as it stands needs to be scrapped.  If you need to bring in vegan desserts from another business, do it.  Those desserts were a fail (I tried part of another one of the desserts and was not impressed).  Food took forever to come out, which I'm willing to deal with but you should put something on the menu about that (there are tasteful ways of saying that the food takes time).  The restaurant was not busy at the time."}
{"text":"Great place!  Crabby Cakes for an appetizer. Very tasty and not dense. I expected dense but they were very airy, which was a plus. My food, Veggie Loaf Dinner was truly amazing! I could seriously eat it 2-3x/week. My partner had the Madison Philly and loved it as well. Ambiance was OK, but given it's a cafe, it was perfectly appropriate. Staff was attentive and good at their jobs. Great lunch experience."}
{"text":"Visited this reastaurant during a short visit to Madison. Compared to the vegan food restos in bigger cities, this didn't compare nor could it compete. However, we were thankful to have found this place to eat due to the lack of vegan options in Madison.  Food was good, nothing spectacular but fair, and portions were also good. Service was great and the deserts was AWESOME! Would visit again and recommend."}
{"text":"Lots of Vegan and Vegetarian options!   Ambience: casual but classy - their light fixtures are pretty cool.   Parking: street; it can be a challenge finding a decent spot given the proximity to other great restaurants and bars   Price: A little pricey for the quantity of food you get  Food: Menu is pretty varied, you can have a noodle dish or a sandwich or a wrap or rice or pasta or a salad. Their kale chips are AWESOME! We got nachos to share and jambalaya and cornbread. The nachos were good but not as good as the ones in Tex tubbs tacos. The jambalaya was lacking in heat but had great flavors and the cornbread was delicious. Food overall was pretty good but nothing on the menu that was crave-worthy.   Dessert: Chocolate lava cake was to die for. It's vegan.. super moist and served warm. Great way to end a meal."}
{"text":"My husband had the schnitzel and I had the crabby cake po' boy.  Magnificent!  We also had the caramel cheesecake and I nearly dropped dead.  My only gripe is about the prices.  Just a tad bit too high.   But lordy, I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"After a few more meals and a few more months, I'm downgrading Green Owl to three stars.  It's still a cool place, and a useful veggie alternative, but honestly, the food is just \"meh.\""}
{"text":"I have never had a bad or even average meal here. My favorite is probably the BBQ jackfruit sandwich at lunchtime.  The interior is gorgeous and the bar has some very tasty concoctions that often feature local spirits."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fresh ingredients, fair prices. This place has a nice ambiance with young, old and hipster clientele, and performers often eat there before a set at the Barrymore or other nearby clubs. Great owner and nice waitstaff."}
{"text":"LOVE the Green Owl!  Great spot for vegetarians (how fun is it to order off the menu knowing you can order anything)!  Really tasty drinks too (try the lemonade or the chai-tini for an adult beverage).  I have also never been disappointed by the desserts. The Devil Wings are my favorite appetizer and something I crave regularly.  However, I AM going to hold a grudge against The Green Owl, or maybe a silent protest at least, for taking two of my favorite items off the menu: the open faced curry \"tuna\" melt and the BBQ jackfruit sandwich.  I know they want all the items to be \"healthy\" but come on, vegetarians need to indulge too!  Maybe they could create a guilty section of the menu and bring these things back with the disclaimer: will induce veggie food addiction and dreams about curry melts.  I mean, it would only help their business.  Since those two are gone I usually go for the crabby cake po boy which never disappoints.  I also wish they would rotate some of the items on the menu and work on making some new creations because as a veggie who cooks, I also make a lot of the items on the menu at home.  Even so, I will keep coming back...waiting for that jackfuit sandwich or curry melt to reunite itself with my taste buds."}
{"text":"I eat mostly vegan now and it's quite useful having a restaurant like this around.  I don't eat out nearly as much as I used to.  I had a great lunch here.  I had the po'boy and a chocolate cake.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were a little disappointing (next time I'll get fries) but everything else was just superb.  The waitress was warm and friendly.  Service wasn't fast but it wasn't too slow either."}
{"text":"We drove 7 hours to get there and arrived 10 minutes before they closed and we still had a great meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I'm vegan and it's always been the most convenient option. However, for the last 10 or so times I've been, it's been shocking how disorganized and rude the employees are. The wait is now always over 30 minutes even when there are obviously multiple tables open. There is no urgency to take your name, answer questions, seat you, or get you your food. At my last visit, after explicit directions to leave it off, our food came out with dairy in it TWICE. The bathrooms and tables are dirty, and it takes HOURS to be seated, served, and get your bill. It literally makes me uncomfortable how rude the employees are. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! Just go. I can't wait to have their no meat meatloaf again. And go hungry enough for dessert. Or just go for pie. Whatever. Just go. Thanks, Owl for making veggie eating during our visit a no brainer!"}
{"text":"We just happened upon this place down the street from The Chrysalis Salon. Cute place with friendly service! I'm not vegan but the meatloaf was to die for!"}
{"text":"First off the food took way too long to come to our table, especially when there was easily more serving staff than customers in the restaurant (we waited approximately 40 minutes.)  Second, I ordered the French toast, which was more of french bread they had toasted with a side of maple syrup. It was generally pretty disappointing to pay $9 for toast.   I can understand not every dish is going to be A+ at a given restaurant, but when something is this awful it speaks volumes. If something is that bad don't put it on your menu in the first place. My girlfriends' Po Boy sandwich was passable, but we were both so peeved that my dish was awful she couldn't even enjoy hers."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian - so take this with a grain of salt...  I was not impressed. The vegan cheese was a decent appetizer. The kale chips were different - worth a try. The roasted potatoes were pretty weak and the po boy was kind of boring.  I liked the interior, but the food just didn't hit the mark. However, I'd give it a second try since they have a big menu. Also - I thought it was a bit expensive for being in Atwood and not using meat?!"}
{"text":"Really great vegan and vegetarian meals here (they sell no meat on the premises, but do have eggs for brunch).  Make sure you don't miss their orange blossom lemonade, it is amazing! I recommend the bbq jackfruit and vegetarian italian beef (which is a little salty, as a heads up). Their brunch is also very good, but only available on Sunday for a few hours.  Their desserts are all vegan and made from scratch. Their cheesecakes are to die for."}
{"text":"Solid homemade-style vegetarian food. We LOVED the raw tacos made made with romain lettuce and filled with avacodo, salsa and walnut chorizo so much that we ordered them again for desert! :)  We also had the Gramma's veggie-walnut loaf which was delicious and the Madison Philly with thin-sliced seitan which was enjoyable but could use a little extra punch."}
{"text":"Great spot! Came from NY and thankfully it's one of the handful of places out here that serves awesome vegan fair. If I ever come back I'll know where to stop"}
{"text":"WOW! SO glad I decided to get some food here before leaving town.  I am a vegetarian but the husband is not so I rarely eat out at a place like this.  Did it ever exceed my expectations!  Lovely little space, amazingly friendly waitstaff, and the food was to die for.  I was actually full!  Most places have \"vegetarian\" food which is just bun and some lettuce...these were proper meals.  Even a meat eater could enjoy themselves here.  I will absolutely return here again next time I'm in town and the husband's coming with."}
{"text":"It's a sweet spot with so much potential.  I feel as though it falls into the stereotype of vegetarian food being boring."}
{"text":"The Green Owl Cafe might be my new lover.  I moved to Madison determined to be faithful to my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Boston (well, actually, it's in Cambridge - naturally). But I strayed over to the Green Owl today, and I have a feeling I may stray again.  Many of the dishes here are both approximations of items that include meat, but they still work with the texture and taste of the meat substitute. It's not just, \"Remove the meat and let's throw in some tofu.\" While my BBQ jackfruit sandwich did not taste *just like* pulled pork, the tangy sauce worked with, rather than against, the meaty flavor and stringy texture of the fruit. The \"crabby cakes\" (tofu and mushroom base, with a spicy chipotle sauce) were simply yummy (that is the most precise description I can think of). The TLT (read: BLT with tempeh instead of bacon) with avocado was divine.  We also loved our desserts (vegan vanilla cheesecake and vegan strawberry shortcake). It is still incredible to me that one can make vegan whipped cream.  Cute decor and nice outdoor seating. Our service was some of the best I've had in years. Our waitress was unfailingly cheerful and seemed to constantly be making the rounds to refill our water, not disappearing into the kitchen for 30 minutes at a time.  I'll be back to try the curry melt, the vegan schnitzel, the jambalaya, and the empanadas. Even the vegetarian meatball sub sounds good.  I also see on their Facebook page that they have monthly raw food dinners. The menu from last month's looks pretty outrageous: cucumber-dill soup, watermelon-tomato salad, hummus and crackers, \"BBQ\" papaya \"steak\" with veggie kabobs and corn on the cob, berry cobbler with banana ice cream, all for $25 prix fixe! I'm marking my calendar now."}
{"text":"If it were legal, I would marry the green owl and have little green owl babies and spread them all over so that more people could enjoy this fabulous place!  The bf and I were in Madison visiting his folks, and we wanted to try out a local veggie friendly spot. This restaurant not only met our expectations, but exceeded them.  Ordered: -\"Fish\" sandwich with vegan coleslaw and tartar and roasted potato for the side. -Vegan chili with cornbread -Kale chips  Dessert: -Raw Tropical Cheesecake -Vegan Chocolate Lave Cake.  I'm not blowing smoke up their ass when I say everything was amazingly delicious. My faux fish sandwich was so ridiculously good, and somehow fishy tasting! You would have never guessed that anything on the plate was actually vegan! My bf really enjoyed the chili as well. The kale chips were crisp and flavorful, but just a tad oily for our liking.  The real stars of the show were the INCREDIBLE desserts. The raw cheesecake had some much flavor and the texture was spot on. The vegan chocolate lava cake was heaven sent. Rich and gooey and delicious!  The servers were friendly and the food was served prompt. For those who have never been there, you should probably not be claustrophobic, as many of the tables are very close together. I didn't mind though cause I got to check out all the awesome food that people were eating!  I can't wait to move to Madison and come here on a weekly basis! And their website tells me they have a monthly raw meal dinner?! Sign me up!"}
{"text":"45 min for noodles and a quesadilla.  Slow service and overpriced drinks.  Once we finally got our food it tasted fine, just took waaay too long for our simple dishes to come out.  Not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying I'm not a vegan, but it was really eye opening to try some wonderfully DELICIOUS dishes from Green Owl! It definitely provided me with some inspiration to try to incorporate more vegan options in my cooking!!! went with a group of 6 and you betcha I sampled from each person's plate. I had never even heard of jackfruit before... as the name implies, it's a FRUIT!! BUT has the consistency of shredded beef/chicken and was used as such in my BBQ wrap and the quesadilla. I'm a fan!!! They also had house-made kombucha... I'm not a fan of this drink in general, but several people I was with ordered it and found it enjoyable.   My only complaint was when I asked for more napkins. See, my boyfriend plopped down at the table when we were seated and knocked over the little flower vase with water, so we used all the napkins at our disposal to soak it up. I explained this and asked if we could have more napkins. The waitress brought us THREE napkins for six people. Wtf... are we sharing napkins now? My sister assumed this was a waste-minimizing action, which I can understand to a certain extent, but Jesus..."}
{"text":"Great spot for a drink, vegetarian/vegan food, and to sit. They've done great work with the walls and space, and service is very understanding with customers with diet restrictions or allergies. I'll eat almost anything but my out of town visitor with severe food allergies was delighted with the service and quality of the food.  Empanadas are a little on the small side but taste good and are served with a healthy plate of beans and rice.   Their schnitzel is fast becoming a Madison classic. The potatoes are beautifully roasted, the daily vegetable is fresh from the market, and the fake schnitzel (tasted like a combo of gluten and soy, sort of like the Worthington brand meat replacements) was nicely fried in a rich breading and covered with an excellent vegan mushroom sauce. It's a veritable destination dish for local vegetarians.   The jackfruit barbecue was OK. I do eat meat and the texture and flavor was just a little too off for me, though I basically liked it. Kale chips are good but a little salty and dry. I make them at home sometimes so that's a complaint with the preparation in general; the Owl did as good a version as possible with such a dense leafy green, it's just not the most tasty baked vegetable.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have lived in a vegetarian housing co-op for over 10 years. I am not a rabid meat eater, I have plenty of experience cooking and eating vegan and vegetarian food.   This is not a good place to eat. The only thing worth buying is the vegan cheesecake, that bumps up my review from 1 star to 2.   WAAAAY to much emphasis on \"meat replacement\" dishes. No, I don't want fake crab cakes. \"devil wings\" are gross. \"unchicken\" is gross.   Their non \"meat replacement\" dishes are underwhelming and overpriced.   For Madison vegetarian options you are better off going to a Thai/Loas place, Himal Chuli, one of the many Indian places in town, ect.. and order vegetarian options. Or come by a housing co-op for a free dinner some time."}
{"text":"I just tried this cafe for the first time and fell in love with the food. It was amazing  to be able to look at the menu and be able to order every single thing! The Devil Wings were my favorite. I love how this restaurant caters to vegetarians and vegans. The service was a little slow, but everyone was laid back and nice. My Overall experience was awesome and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Updated my review because of excellent customer service from the owner. Went back to The Green Owl and the service and food were excellent. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ehhh its ok .... I have had better I got the jamalaya and I thought it wasnt seasoned well, also. But I did love the po' boy  it was GREAT .. SO I guess this place is a hit or miss... also I hate that its not open every day.. I think I tried to go on a monday and it was closed"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I had the TLT Avocado sandwich with Kale crisps and then the mocha chocolate cake for dessert. All vegan and all DELICIOUS. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty lukewarm about The Green Owl, honestly. And given my borderline veganness, it surprises some people when I tell them that. While I have to give it some credit for being the only 100% vegetarian restaurant in the area (That i'm aware of. Someone should holla at me if there's another), I overall have been to places that do vegetarian/vegan much better than The Green Owl in other cities.  When it comes to strengths, i'll tell you now that The Green Owl has very good desserts, including a vegan cheesecake that was delicious. It was good enough to motivate me to create my own, although that was a failure =/. I'll also say that the menu has a good variety going, so you can satisfy a wide span of cravings there including Mexican, Asian, or traditional American food. This makes Green Owl a pretty safe bet place to go to in certain situations.  On the other hand, I feel like Green Owl has a lot of room for improvement. First off, I'm usually disappointed with the size of the portions I receive. It's usually too small, and sometimes after eating an entree I feel like I could easily down another one, which is not how I should feel after a meal is over. Another critique I have is with the decor and furniture they use in the restaurant. It overall feels very kiddy, and somewhat tacky. I particularly am not a fan of the green chairs. The decor overall makes me feel like i'm in a space for children, which I personally do not enjoy much.  Finally, while I would say that most of the food i've had here is pretty good, it doesn't stack up compared to some of the other vegan gems i've had, like Soul Vegetarian, Native Foods, or Chicago Diner, all in Chicago. One example that springs to mind is comparing the nachos at Green Owl to the nachos at Native Foods. Native Foods nachos are just LOADED, and have very tasty substitute meats and cheeses. Green Owl just doesn't do it as great, and I think that they're both the same price too. A good start toward upping the ante for Green Owl would be completely ditching the Daiya cheese in favor of a nut based substitute. Even if it's more expensive, it would be worth it to be more tasty and healthy.  Overall, I would say that I like The Green Owl, but i'm a ways from loving it. I know that they have been tinkering with the menus lately, so hopefully with some more adjustments, they can turn into a place that I love."}
{"text":"My sister and I are vegetarians, the rest of our family and friends are not.  We've taken our parents, extended relatives and meat-loving boyfriends to this place more than a couple of times to open their palates a little bit. All of the food on the menu is approachable and nothing too \"out there\" for someone who has never eaten tofu before. The homemade drinks are great, as well as their desserts. The waitstaff are friendly and can answer any questions you have about the menu. When I go, I usually go full bore and order an entree, specialty drink and dessert, so it ends up being a little pricier than most meals. Generally $25-30 with tip.  I do wish they had a couple more menu items without all of the soy meat replacements, though. Some meals don't normally have meat in them in the first place and could be a great addition to their menu."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  So nice to have a great vegetarian restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Oooooo I love this place, I drive from White water at least once a month just to eat here.   I'm vegan and miss the options meat eaters have. This place gives me back that freedom I miss without having to harm a friend.  Thank you Green Owl"}
{"text":"Came here last night for take out. I got the Vegan Schnitzel=wow! Very flavorful and nice portion. The car was filled by the aroma and I was salivating even before making it home to enjoy. Glad to have a nice Vegan restaurant close by with a nice variety of options. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a vegetarian or vegan twist on usual favorites. We had the tofu scramble and the vegan huevos rancheros. Both decent dishes. The blueberry jalapeño waffle was a bit too dense and borderline hard. The best appetizer were the crabby cakes made with TVP and mushroom.   The service was a bit lackluster. They took a while to take orders. They were kinda slow to get the food out and when they did they forgot the crabby cakes. The zinger drink tasted bit soapy and disappointing"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write about this place for months...I was traveling the Midwest (live in California) for work and found this cafe using yelp. I was so excited to find a veg restaurant in Madison. It is located in a very cute little area in what looks like an older part of town. I arrived just after opening and the staff was so friendly. I asked my servers advice on what to have and her suggestions were perfect. The TLA sandwich was so tasty and the cup of chili went perfectly with it. The cafe is also very comfy and I loved the decor. If I ever make it back to Madison, I would defiantly eat here again!"}
{"text":"This was our go to restaurant every time we are in Madison, but I have to say, this last time we were very disappointed.  Went here this past Saturday.  Got there at 2:15 and were told there was a 15 minute wait.  No problems. As we waited the bartender asked the couple waiting next to us if they wanted something to drink while they waited, apparently we must have not looked thirsty, because we were never asked.  Finally they seated us at 2:50.  Was given a menu and water, but was not asked if we wanted drinks at the table. We were informed they were out of anything that contained a potato, mind you this was around 3 in the afternoon. So we ordered an appetizer then 10 minutes later we ordered our entrées.  30 minutes after being sat at our table, all we had was two glasses of water, with no ice and my husbands glass had a huge crack in it.  Nothing came to the table.  The couple that was offered drinks from the bartender was seated after us, and they had food and drinks.   Finally we gave up.  We had to be somewhere at 4:30 so we decided to get up and leave. Our Saturday from 2:15 till 3:30... complete waste of time with slightly rude and unorganized staff.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Maybe the best omelette I've ever had. The right proportions of everything-eggs, veggies, potatoes-and the seasoning was spot on. A relaxed but tasteful place with personality-and friendly college student wait staff. Whenever I'll be in Madison, it will be a priority to return."}
{"text":"Favorite as favorite can be. Loved the Kombucha Tea on tap firstly, and the mushroom vegan crab cake rock. Soups are also so delectable at this quaint little joint!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but I've enjoyed the food. Tried middle-eastern platter, crabby cake po'boy and tlt with avocado. We've also ordered 2 sides: roasted rosemary-garlic red potatoes and kale crisps. They did gave us 2 potatoes instead but once we brought this to their attention we were promptly given a free order of kale crisps."}
{"text":"The best place for vegan love in town!  had the meatloaf plate. SO GOOD.  and huge.  If you like coconut, you MUST get the coconut cream pie.   And their boozy drink specials are legit."}
{"text":"This is the first experience I've had at a (mostly) vegan restaurant. The places is small and very hipster. Our wait staff was nice. My father in-law was taking a long time wrapping up at the end, so we were kind of pushed out at the end because people were waiting. I mean, I get it, but still.  I had these noodles with a peanut butter sauce. Of course I don't remember the name. It was ok. The noodles were spaghetti noodles and I expected some sort of Asian noodle. The sauce actually tasted like peanut butter. My brother in-law has the dragon fruit quesadillas. Now those were awesome!   One thing to mention, for those of us who are meat eaters, remember, there is. I meat here. I recommend getting a dish that does not mock meat, so that you aren't disappointed. I say this because we had some \"chicken wings\" and while they did a good job, I was disappointed because they were not chicken.   For dessert I had the chocolate ginger cheesecake. AMAZING. Smooth and creamy. The finer not overpowering the chocolate! Yummy.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I want to give 5 stars but the food isn't that consistent. I usually love their daily chili specials. Nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I came back to the Green Owl this past weekend because I recently \"liked\" them on Facebook  and keep seeing updates (with drool-inducing photos) of their daily specials (also, the owner commented on my last lukewarm review and stated that an influx of Groupon customers may have been the cause of the subpar service we experienced).  Needless to say, the service this time around was very much improved. This time I tried the curry lentil soup, which was thinner than I thought it would be, but very flavorful. I got the eggplant meatball sandwich again (I came so close to ordering the vegan schnitzel but I caved at the last minute and went with a tried and true favorite). Oh my goodness, it was so good. I actually will be trying my hand at making my own eggplant meatballs next week because they are all I want to eat now!   I also ordered the roasted potatoes as a side this time instead of the kale crisps (I found the kale crisps to be a tad too salty). I'm glad I made the switch -- the potatoes are delicious. Usually potatoes are pretty ho-hum and are left behind at the end of a meal, but these were perfectly seasoned and cooked, and I love that the skins were left on.  I still have yet to try their desserts. One day I will have to trek over here just for a slice of their cheesecake."}
{"text":"This place made my day!  We ordered the vegan BUffalo Wings which were to die for. Truly fantastic. The waitress recommended the Blackened Tofu Cuban sandwich which, while spicy as hell, was one of the best meals I have ever had. Being a traveling Vegan, this place was an oasis. Can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"Popped in to TGO for lunch. We had our meal in less than 10 minutes, and it was amazing as usual. If you are looking for vegan comfort food in Madison, this is the place to go. Definitely choose the kale chips as your side. They melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Food was good (I had a TLT with Avocado, side of quinoa salad), excellent even, which is why it pains me to dock this place 3 stars for the service. I literally waited an hour for a SANDWICH. The waitress was pretty gruff and the place was maybe half full."}
{"text":"What a delicious meal for Mother's Day Brunch...can't quite get their timing of service down, however.  Seriously...waiting 17 MINUTES+ for my credit card and check to come back!  Not cool!"}
{"text":"Took a detour on i90 to come visit. Delicious. Absolutely delicious. I had a crabby cake po boy and it was the best thing I've eaten in a while... Friendly staff provided me with a few suggestions and directed me to an awesome local café so I could get my coffee fix before getting back on the road."}
{"text":"There is nothing so incredible as a full out veggie restaurant that serves a filling home style healthy and tasty meal and tops it with chocolate decadence like their Lava Cake! And I might add, great service/low attitude."}
{"text":"Very creative and interesting dishes! Like Switzerland, its a neutral zone where omnivores, vegetarians and vegans can relax and just get along.  I've been here several times and am always impressed by how flavorful everything is and the variety of entrees.  Some favorites: Vegan Schnitzel Shepherd's Pie- daily special"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and maybe i've just been lucky, but every time, it's been GREAT. And I pretty much thought most everything other people I was with ordered and I snacked on was great too. Last week, I had the avocado blt which was fantastic. I also had a cup of sweet potato chili... I guess it wasn't great... but it was decent. I've also had the crabby cakes and the jackfruit sandwich - both recommended.  Service is friendly. Interior is comfortable and casual. And they have a patio now too.  Note to self: go here way more often!"}
{"text":"Food here is amazing. The TLT (tempeh, lettuce, tomato and avocado) is ridiculously good. The staff is friendly, and happy to offer up suggestions. They also have great soup options every day, It is all vegan and vegetarian fare, but don't let that scare you away! The flavors will make your mouth happy."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of vegetarian, vegan and/ gluten-free.  I tend toward the vegetarian that isnt gluten-free  but have tried vegan that was gluten-free free all were wonderful good taste and texture not the usual mushy cheese covered vegs or oil dripping grilled veg  which is so refreshing"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Not much different than the blue plate diner sans meat, which is to say, not that it is bad, but nothing here is delicate. And why am I paying $13 for a meal with no meat that is basically diner food?  In my book this place needs to up its game, which basically means that it needs to cook better than I can cook at home.  Unfortunately we won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"If you like tasty vegetable/vegetarian dishes, The Green Owl is not the place for you. The owner stubbornly refuses to offer much more than fake meat entrees. I suppose she doesn't need to, as she seems to be successful with her would-be carnivore dishes. Not wanting one of those, I, as a vegetarian --near vegan-- ordered the Mediterranean plate/platter, which was barely recognizable as such. Much better vegetarian food can be found nearby at Bunky's, The Weary Traveler and Monty's Blue Plate. And at The Green Owl, you're going to pay inflated prices. Very dubiously, I gave it a second try, and my dining companion and I disliked it as much as the first time. I would never go back or recommend that anyone eat at TGO."}
{"text":"Honestly, the TLT avocado sandwich BLEW my mind. Green Owl, you have my heart."}
{"text":"My boys and I road tripped from Dubuque on Mother's Day to eat here, so there was a bit of anticipation built up, I didn't realize they closed at 3, but we arrived at 2:30 and stood in the foyer area waiting to be seated for what seemed like 4-5 mins, the girl behind the counter was wiping things down and refused eye contact, the hostess eventually came to say she be right back, no apology for waiting and no friendly gesture. I felt horribly uncomfortable and unwelcome. When we're sat, they explained it would be awhile before the waitress came, it was about 8 mins, she also had a strange unwelcoming attitude and at this point I considered leaving and if I wasn't with my boys I absolutely would have. My youngest is vegan and was so stoked to be there, I had to maintain my composure. There were about 4 other tables that we could see, and one waiting for food yet. We put our order in and had conversation while we waited. I ordered biscuits and gravy for an app which fully confused our waitress for some reason. After our food came she became really nice and easy going, not sure if she was feeling pressure from back of the house or what but the shift in welcomeness was beyond welcome and noticeable. Both my boys ordered the TLT and were beyond happy with it, biscuits and gravy a bit hard and bland, I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was delicious (pictured) overall, we paid and left adequate 20% gratuity and as we left no one said thank you or good bye (3:25) Certainly a memorable Mother's Day experience. The only way I'll come back is if my boys suggest it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my list for a long time. So happy I finally got to try the food. My waitress was super friendly. I couldn't decide what to order, so I asked for some help and she definitely had the right suggestion. She told me that the best seller was the Tlt, but she said her favorite was the Cajun Blackened Tofu. She also provided the disclaimer that this would be pretty spicy which was the perfect selling point for me.  I ended up getting the tofu with a salad as my side. She was correct that this dish had a kick to it, but it was just the right amount of spice. I would definitely order this sandwich again! The spice also paired nicely with the sweetness of the side salad. I was impressed that this was not your standard side salad. It was mixed greens, with shaved carrots, some quinoa, and a sweet dressing. Next time I would order the dressing on the side as some of the greens got a little soggy.   I'll have to get back soon to try more of the options!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times. On a note of service, some of their best servers don't even work here anymore and I can't imagine what it's like now. The last time I went my server forgot our appetizers completely. In a completely empty restaurant.  If you're a regular here, you're a regular. It's because you've came here from when it first opened and still reminisce about how things were.  For being so pro vegan, you'd think they'd buy food local. They don't. That Sysco truck is big and shiny and isn't doing much for it's vegan name.  There are more reasons that people don't eat meat than just morals. It's flavor, too. And this restaurant provides a lot of imitation meat instead of focusing on making food from scratch that doesn't include making food that tastes like roast beef.  The Green Owl, although thoughtful and a great idea, is poorly executed. Small portions and high prices. Anyone notice that the menu hasn't changed at all?  It's time for a new executive chef and new and interesting approaches to cooking cruelty-free and supporting local."}
{"text":"Me likey!   As a vegan I get asked my thoughts on The Green Owl all the time. It's the only vegetarian/vegan restaurant in town, so I'm bound to have a firm stance, right? Well... not really. Until now, I'd only been once and I had a salad, which is, like, the most snooze-worthy thing you can get.  I went back on a gorgeous summer night and grabbed a table outside. With a Bike Benefits deal I had the option of $1 hummus or a $2 beer. I chose beer. I will ALWAYS choose beer. I ordered a Furthermore Knot Stock to drink and Grandma's Veggie Loaf to eat. The vegetable-walnut loaf came with a tangy tomato glaze, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. The loaf was realllllly tasty and I scarfed it down in about 45 seconds. My dinnermate loved her TLT with avocado (that's tempeh instead of bacon, folks!). I had a super solid time and thought everything was tasty. ME LIKELY A LOT."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan restaurant. The coolest vegan place I have ever been. I wish there were more places like Green Owl in twin cities, MN."}
{"text":"Really yummy food-no wonder they've won best vegetarian restaurant in Madison a few times over.  The café was really cute, complete with owl decorations and green chairs.  We had to wait for a few minutes to be seated, as expected.  However, once we ordered, the food took ~45 minutes to come- but that was the only big downside.  I ordered the Brekkie sandwich and substituted the tofu patty for scrambled egg at no extra charge.  The sandwich was a bit small, since it was served on an English muffin.  I was a bit disappointed by the size, but the taste was absolutely amazing.  I have no idea what they put in the vegan aioli, but it was so GOOD and complimented the vegan cheddar cheese and ripe avocado super well.  Also really enjoyed the fake sausage patty, and I'm usually not one for fake meats.  It came with a huge side of red pan-fried potatoes, which were seasoned perfectly.  My only complaint is with the slow service-but if you're looking for amazing vegetarian/vegan cuisine, you absolutely can't skip out on Green Owl."}
{"text":"It was great to visit a place in Madison with a lot of vegan options. The portions were a good size and everything we had was wonderful. The outdoor seating is also dog friendly. This will be a stop I make anytime I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Recently went back and the service was stellar!  The buffalo wings and the southwest salad were unbelievably good.  Yay!"}
{"text":"7/13/11 Update:  I have gone back a few times now.  The desserts have improved quite a bit.  I've tried a couple of the sandwiches, and they've been on the better side of ok.  Unfortunately, I'm scared off of the schnitzel, so I don't know if it's changed or not.  Updating to 3 stars.  I'm still a bit disappointed by the offerings, as it's a fake meat inspired menu, and a bit overpriced for the portions.  ******************************************  Original Post************** The specials are FANTASTIC!  I have been blown away by every single special I've had.  They've had a fairly wide range, so it's fair to say that they put a lot of effort into them.  Sadly, the regular menu items have been mediocre.  I really wish they didn't have a menu that was designed around everything being 'fake meat', rather than appreciating the wide world of food outside of the tiny kingdom of meat for what it is and the flavors it offers. (Very sadly, as I was SUPER looking forward to it, the vegan schnitzle was so dry and hard, I couldn't even cut it).  Interesting drink specials, too. :D   I really REALLY want to like the desserts. However, they've been super hit or miss.  Example: 3 times I've tried the lava cake. It's one of my favorite desserts. 1 out of the 3 times it was palatable. The others it was a briquette. I recognize that could be restaurant staff overheating it before serving; but even then, it shouldn't be that hard and dry.  Of the cheesecake dessert specials, which they seem to have frequently, one was divine (cherry amaretto), the others have been 'meh'.  The S'more pie was fantastic the first time, and then I had it twice afterwards and it was completely different each time- only good the first."}

{"text":"First--I am not vegan or a vegetarian; I love meat as much as the next person. Prior to my first  visit, I was quite hesitant as you can imagine but decided to give it a shot. And...this place is AMAZING! A perfect and much needed restaurant for Madison. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious. (I've gone back quite a few times). My favorite dishes are the Groundnut Stew, the raw taco platter, and the crabby cakes. My suggestion: never leave without ordering a slice of pure heaven cheesecake/dessert. It makes me feel better about myself since it's vegan. ;) I usually dine on week nights since they're not as busy. Service is always pleasant and courteous. Needless to say, I will be returning for more vegan goodness."}
{"text":"There are few places I can go that I don't have to worry about gluten free and vegan options being a complicated order.  The food is made with heart and the wholesome goodness leaves you walking out with a positive energy and a full belly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I'm vegan, so I was super excited to try this place. My friend and I split the vegan schnitzel and got soup on the side, a tofu curry. The soup was good, but the entree was all kinds of wrong. The schnitzel tasted like they reheated a frozen patty and put some mushroom sauce on top. The potatoes needed lots of extra salt/pepper to taste like anything, and the broccoli was flavorless. ALL WERE COLD. We were going to get dessert, but decided to get some vegan cupcakes at the Coop down the street. EXCELLENT CHOICE. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"So they are not kidding, this place has no animal protein at all.   Does have a dog friendly patio and pleasant  service."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I almost always order something vegetarian anyway when I go out to eat. Naturally I thought then that going to a vegetarian place would be a good idea. I was disappointed.  Nothing on the menu was very tempting, mainly because it all seems to be classic meat dishes with meat replacements. I would've loved to see a list of interesting soups and salads.   The spinach artichoke dip tasted pretty terrible which I didn't think was possible and the crackers it came with tasted like cardboard. The other dishes went similarly.  I will say they had really interesting, delicious cocktails!"}
{"text":"Wandered in recently before a concert at the Barrymore. Place is absolutely adorable and the staff were so nice. I had a few fairly idiotic questions as there was plenty on the menu I wasn't familiar with. My server was happy to explain and even seemed really excited to talk about what they do.  The menu was so much more \"meaty\" so to speak than some other places that cater to the vegan/vegetarian market....Meaning you'll find some very filling and unique things like Vegan Schnitzel (Which was delicious by the way) and their take on pulled-unpork and uncrab patties.  Very local and fresh ingredients. Decent prices. Nice beer list and signature cocktails infused in house.   I am neither a vegan nor a vegetarian and I was very satisfied with my experience. It's work checking out."}
{"text":"Praise be, Madison finally has a vegetarian restaurant! Best of all, The Green Owl fits the bill as a go-to spot whenever you happen to be in town---it's casual, affordable and has a good-sized menu so you can try something new each time you stop by. About 80% of the menu is vegan and all vegan items are labeled. Green Owl also has rotating vegan dessert specials daily. If you're in Madison and you're vegan or vegetarian or just like good food, this place should be at the top of your list.  The space itself is lovely: bright; colorful; retro-mod with a bistro-bar ambience. The bar up front is a bit cramped and too close to the front door (a chilly spot in winter) but it'll be great in the summer. Green Owl has a good selection of unusual wines and beers.  I do wish that Green Owl was a bit more casual and offered original coffee & tea drinks, so that the space could double-up as a coffee shop as well. I think it would draw people in and (hopefully) steal away customers from less veg-friendly places in that area. It would also save me the hassle of driving a mile down the road to the Williamson Street Co-op to pick up a fresh chai for my frequent trips to/fro Minneapolis to/fro Chicago.  I first time I went I had a BBQ jackfruit sandwich with roasted potatoes ($8). The sandwich tasted good on a whole, but was not without flaws. For one thing, there wasn't enough jackfruit---it seemed like only a few small pieces. Secondly, I don't know if mixing coleslaw on the sandwich worked with the smoky-sweet flavor of the barbecue sauce. Lastly, the artisan bread was not toasted enough, and was too thick; I would have preferred a thinner, toasted whole wheat option. The roasted potatoes were a tasty side, though.  I also had a slice of coconut creme pie ($6) for dessert. This was spectacular. It was oh-so-subtly sweet, with wonderfully airy \"creme\" and nice crispy-crumbly notes from shaved coconut and a great crust.   The second time I went to Green Owl I had the \"vegetarian Italian beef\" (which is vegan; $9). This sandwich was excellent and tasted just like Italian beef sandwiches, though with seitan. The bread got nicely soggy and wet and brought back many memories. I think the seitan could have been marinated more in the sauce, but it was a great-tasting meal and much better than the BBQ jackfruit sandwich. I got it with a side of kale crisps, which were also awesome, and not usually seen on menus. The portion size could have been slightly larger given the price, but this was definitely a high-grade meal and well-executed.  For dessert I had a slice of New York cheesecake ($6) which came topped with strawberries, whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and one fresh mint leaf. This cheesecake was wonderful and one of the best I've ever had. It was rich, but not too sweet, and the interplay of the caramel, strawberries, mint and whipped cream was divine.  On my third visit, I had the vegan schnitzel ($13) which comes with either a soup or salad. The soup was an amazing winter vegetable medley that was quite spicy (probably too much so for most people, but just perfect for me). The schnitzel itself was also spectacular---I've never had real schnitzel, but this was a breaded, meaty marvel covered in a savory mushroom stroganoff-style sauce. I enjoyed the garlic green beans and roasted red potatoes that also came with the dish. For dessert I got a chocolate mousse tart ($6) which came with raspberry sauce and soy whipped cream; this was delicious and the chocolate had a slightly minty flavor. Green Owl consistently does excellent desserts.  For the fourth visit I had their crabby cakes sandwich ($9) which was tasty on fluffy white bread. It seemed a bit small for the price tag, but it was still good. On a whole, I would recommend the Italian beef or the schnitzel over anything else (I have yet to try their jambalaya, however). I also had a slice of key lime cheesecake ($6) which was good, and had a nicely browned/baked top layer, though it wasn't as good as the New York cheesecake I'd had a couple months back.  The service is always friendly and helpful. On at least two separate occasions my server also got me samples of the other available vegan dessert of the day, which was a great way to help me decide which dessert to choose.  Every town should have an all-purpose veg. spot like this one. I'm glad Green Owl is around, though I'm afraid it'll prevent me from ever trying other places in Madison!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here last night for a full course meal. We ordered the crabby cakes which took awhile (heard the kitchen was training new hires) and when they came out we were a bit disappointed. There was too much sauce on each cake that I scrapped half off. However, our entrees were great! We had the veggie loaf and the philly and finished off with the coconut key lime cheesecake. We'll be back for sure since the food and service was great!"}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite place in town! For me, part of the fun of dining out is deciding what to order, and the more options from which to choose, the better. As a vegan, I cannot overstate how wonderful it is to go into a place where the majority of items are vegan. When I go into pretty much any other restaurant in town, I scan the menu and the choices are narrowed down to one or two--that's like having my choice made for me! Plus, that also means that even if the dish is good, I won't frequent the place because who wants to eat the one same thing over & over?  That being said, the food at Green Owl is spectacular. Creatively & thoughtfully prepared, and whether you're looking for uber-healthful raw food or somewhat decadent \"comfort food\", you'll find it at the Green Owl. Some reviews on here have complained about the prices, but bear in mind that the Green Owl chef attempts to keep ingredients locally sourced, and the presentation is artful. This isn't some Sysco stuff slopped onto a plate!  In other words, worth every penny!  If you're vegetarian or vegan, this is the place for you. And I've brought several omnivore friends who loved it as well--and came back to the Green Owl on their own!"}
{"text":"Adorable! Great nice people, cutest anthropologie-esque decor, and great comfort food. The vegan schnitzel, bbq jackfruit sandwich, crabby cakes are all great, but the crispy kale chips were definitely the most addictive. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Mixed bag here.  To start the appropriate green meal, I biked here on a warm Thursday. And of course that made me very thirsty for a cocktail. I ordered their passionfruit kombucha (looove) and vodka drink. That was very very tasty. Just what I needed after a long day plus a bike ride.   I wasn't too hungry, so I just ordered a bowl of soup and kale chips to munch with my friend. While the kale chips was bit under my expectation, the curry cauliflower soup was very comforting to my stomach. It's the kind of dish you want to make and savor at home.   My friend ordered the same soup (ugh copy cat), and the stuffed bell pepper dish. Unfortunately the stuffed red pepper did not delight us in any way. The spaghetti sauce like thing strangely looking too stiff and sitting top of the pepper  .... not really appetizing visually, and didn't taste good either.  So on my first try, some hits and misses. I'll gladly bike to here again and sip a cocktail. By the way, check out the interior - it's lovely."}
{"text":"When it comes to vegetarian eating, this restaurant is one of my favorites. Whenever I'm feeling \"healthy\" and visiting my brother in Madison, this is my restaurant of choice.  The food is surprisingly delicious and the options are all tempting and deliver on that promise. Seriously, the jambalaya is one of my favorites here.  Although today I had the most delicious sweet potato meal. It had this wonderful crunch comprised of chopped peanuts. OMG  The restaurant is clean and modern inside, but when the weather is reasonable we like to sit outside under the umbrellas.  Get the coffee.  Comes in individual French presses and will blow you away."}
{"text":"From the outside the Green Owl Cafe looks like a hole in the wall bar. A kitschy place. Once you get inside, the clean sherbet colors immediately elevate your mood. I especially appreciated the back wall of the place which was painted with orange and white birch trees.   Our server was a kind woman who knew the menu inside and out, but didn't take it for granted when we needed a little extra time to drool over the many vegan and vegetarian options.  I got the roasted veggie sandwich which featured beautiful crusty bread, roasted beets and sweet potatoes and other goodies. It was marvelous. I shared with my partner who got a TLT with avocado. Again, the bread was beautiful, the avocado was ripe, and the combination of tomato and seitan was very satisfying. The kale crips melt in your mouth.   I eavesdropped on our neighbors who had a bunch of questions for the server which she answered with ease. She was patient and didn't make anyone feel dumb for asking what anything was on the menu.   Overall, excellent lunch stop in Madison. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not Vegan. I make this claim so I can convince you how awesome this place is. I've tried traditional Schnitzels of all kinds in the Midwest and Germany. I've made them myself at home. But the Vegan Schnitz at Green Owl bests them all. The Oven roasted potatoes were also superb. The Broccoli was meh, but frankly I was too busy enjoying the other stuff on my plate to fret about it."}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Madison's Green Owl Cafe, and I think it's a very okay vegetarian diner. I ordered the Cajun Blackened Tofu with a side cup of chili. The chili was awesome, just spicy enough and very flavorful. The tofu sandwich left me a tiny bit disappointed. It was surprisingly bland, and too \"mooshy\" to be held comfortably as a sandwich.  Lori ordered the Pesto Alfredo, which she said was very good. We ate outside on a sunny spring day, and that was very pleasant.  The wait staff was attentive, although a tad slower than I expected. Not bad, though.  I'll return for sure, I want to try something else!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my 4th time eating at The Green Owl since it opened.  As a vegetarian I really appreciate being able to go to a strictly veggie establishment.  Recently I purchased a Groupon for Green Owl and as a belated b-day gift, my friends took me there for brunch.    They had a good crowd that day when we went.  We were able to get a table right away.  The service was okay.  And I mean just okay.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and a mimosa.  Thank goodness me and my friends had stuff to talk about because it seemed like a long time for us to get our food.  When the food arrived I was disappointed.  Why you ask?  As I looked at my plate, I observed one ordinary sized biscuit with some liquid-y brown 'gravy' over it.  And not much gravy.  Along with the biscuit there was literally a small handful of red potatoes.  The taste?  A bit of overkill on the seasonings in the biscuit and the gravy was okay; the potatoes were good.  My friends tempeh bacon was overcooked but he ate it anyway.  As mentioned above, I like the fact Madison has a veg only restaurant, but there are better places for veg food that offer larger portions for the price you pay.  I really, really, really want to like Green Owl but the prices for the amount of food on your plate has me frequenting other establishments.    If you are ever visiting Chicago, go to the Chicago Diner.  They excel at vegetarian/vegan food."}
{"text":"i hate to admit it. but i'm more impressed with the seasonal cocktails, the charming decor and the waitstaff than the actual food the restaurant provides.  still, i think this place offers an excellent and much-needed service to the vegetarian/vegan crowd."}
{"text":"So I brought my big meat-eating boyfriend here him unknowingly that it was vegetarian:) and we were delighted! We both got the BLT with tempeh on gluten free bread. The favors were definitely there, the tempeh was very good, nothing like bacon, but that's ok! Where Green Owl fell short was the gf bread fell completely apart. The sandwich was comparatively small and very crumbly, we both had to eat with a knife and fork. The kale chips (also a small portion for $3.50 when it's just kale) and quinoa salad, also very good! Overall great flavors, would have liked to eat my sandwich with two hands."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that I've been back to The Green Owl a few times since my review, and it's gotten better and better each time. I would say that it is now a solid 4 stars. Their nightly specials have been more naturally vegetarian food rather than fake meat, and have been great! I had the \"vegetable strudel (vegan) with roasted red pepper sauce--phyllo dough wrapped roasted vegetables topped with red pepper sauce, served with rice pilaf.\" It was beautifully presented and tasty. The vegan phyllo was impressively buttery tasting. We also got the fish fry, which seems to be on the menu each Friday night now. I don't really know my Wisconsin fish fries, with the last time I had fish being 17 years ago, but it was delicious!  The vegan cheese cake was surprisingly tangy (in a good, cheesecakey way) and all around awesome.  I'm still not thrilled about the soups, which is surprising since the owner is pretty much \"the soup lady\" for Mother Fool's and other spots around town - the lentils in the dal weren't fully cooked, and my chili had so much tomato that I couldn't taste much else. They aren't terrible . . . but I would recommend a salad over the soup as a starter."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a groupon yesterday, and overall I liked the food and the fact that Green Owl offers vegan/vegetarian food.  I was a bit surprised at the prices of the dishes, especially because the portion sizes were not particularly big. I was still a bit hungry after our late lunch here, and I don't think I eat all that much. With the groupon we got a good deal, but had we paid full price I think I would have been less happy with our experience here.  We split the Mediterranean Wrap and the Tempeh Jambalaya. The wrap was delicious, with a very fresh tabbouleh and lots of hummus. I felt it was a bit under-stuffed, as I was left with a ton of empty wrap at the ends. We got kale crisps with the wrap, which were delicious. The jambalaya was pretty good, though it was lacking some of the spicy cajun flavor I expect from jambalaya. The tempeh in it was really delicious though.   The main thing I disliked about Green Owl is the fact that most of the dishes they have on the menu are vegetarian versions of meat-centric dishes, and therefore they mainly use meat substitutes. I personally do not care for most meat substitutes, and I think vegan/vegetarian food should emphasize the large abundance of vegetables and lentils/grains with which you can make delicious dishes rather than trying to imitate meat. This is obviously a matter of personal preference, but I have to say I was disappointed to find that Green Owl focuses so much on meat substitutes.  Long story short, this place has some yummy vegan and vegetarian food. I wish it was a bit less expensive or they served a bit more, but this is a good lunch spot...especially if you go in the summer and snag an outdoor table!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, but I requested to return to The Green Owl after a delicious meal 2 years ago (vegetarian is a hard sell with my friends).  The menu held several items I wanted to try, but I ordered the Cajun lemon tofu burger on the advice of the waitress.  My friend got the nightly taco special, and we started with the humus and baba ganoush appetizer.  The humus didn't have any flavor, but the baba ganoush made up for it.  My sandwich was delish and hardy, while my friend said her tacos were really good.  The disappointment came at the end of the meal, when I realized the desserts had not changed.  They offer fab desserts, but only 1 chocolate option.   I would go back in a heartbeat, because I feel good eating vegetarian, and the food is so darn good!"}
{"text":"I have been a vegetarian my whole life, and sometimes going out for dinner is a little bit of a struggle choosing something. I'm so happy to have Green Owl Cafe in Madison for this reason! It's so nice to find a place I can order anything off the menu and not worry if there is bacon in the salad or if the soups are made out of chicken or meat broth.   My favorite foods I have tried at Green Owl so far are their Dare Devil wings, which are their version of spicy hot wings. It comes with vegan ranch which is a delicious combo with their wings. Also their peanut noodle bowl is delicious and amazing. I devoured it in minutes and left me quite satisfied. The Madison Philly is amazing and it has a great taste as well! The sand which also comes with a side!  There are only 2 things that are stopping me from giving Green Owl Cafe 5 stars. First, it is the lack of available parking which can be somewhat of an annoyance especially when you are starving. Also the service can be somewhat spotty and not consistent."}
{"text":"The Green Owl is great, because it has all the ingredients that Madison foodies want, but it isn't pretentious. I love the TLT!"}
{"text":"Things that were really cool about this place: * It's all vegetarian/vegan. I'm a vegetarian. I rarely get this chance to have the WHOLE MENU!!! to look through (and vegans have it much worse). I was a little overwhelmed with the options, but don't worry, I pulled through. * It looks kinda dirty and dusty from the outside, but then it's beautiful, light, airy on the inside. * Alcohol! * You get a tiny French press for coffee  Not as impressive: * My food :( I ordered the nuevos rancheros, and it just tasted dry and bland. YOU CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER! The scrambled eggs were a little weird, and the kind I would usually make at home, because I fail. Derek's meal -- beer caramelized onions & cheese omelet -- was also pretty tasteless, which is hard to do with beer caramelized onions. Right? * We were seated three tables away from the front door/bar area. It wasn't a very busy Sunday brunch time, and there weren't customers around us (they were all in the back). So, no surprise that we could hear the \"super cool\" hipster kid and the other \"super cool\" hipster kid complaining about stupid customers in general. Things like how customers ask if they have dessert, which isn't listed on the menu but at the front of the restaurant. Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was common practice for customers to get up and look around the restaurant for dessert listings.  I was pretty disappointed. We'll try again, possibly for lunch or dinner next time. Please impress us then!"}
{"text":"SO .. I am not a vegan, but I have some family that is and when I am with them we usually go vegan and I don't mind.  I'll tell you what .... if this restaurant was in the western burbs ... I could easily go vegan and eat here daily.  I had the Vegan Schnitzel and the sauce on it was phenomenal for no cream or no dairy butter.  vegan protein is chewier, but when you get past that, and you have sauce on it, you can't really tell if you were eating a real piece of meat or not.  That is what makes this place awesome.  I would definitely come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was amazing! We had the avocado salad, kale chips, a mushroom soup and tacos with rice and beans! It all tasted delicious! Dessert: Vegan-GF-SF-Coconut Pie and a Mojito cheesecake! Incredible!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've come once before for brunch and did not leave satisfied. Wanted to give the green owl another chance because it's one of the few places in Madison dedicated to vegetarian/vegan food. My visit was average. Arrived at around 5 on a Tuesday and got seated immediately. They do have free wifi but I think they turn it off around dinner time--unsure about that.  I ordered the Buffalo wings and a side of the roasted potatoes. If you used to eat meat like me but no longer do, sometimes you may crave the taste of certain food you used to eat. For me, it's wings (more specially the Buffalo sauce). The wings are a decent fix for that craving, nothing out of this world but okay. It comes with 4 pieces, a side of ranch and some celery. The roasted potatoes were pretty disappointing. Just a bit chewy and not very flavorful. I ended up packing most of it to go.  The service was decent as well. It was nice to look at a menu and actually be able to eat everything on it, but I'm not too sure about how often I'll come back. I did want to try jackfruit in vegetarian food, so maybe I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Ok, this place looks and feels exactly like you think it would. Weird lighting, weird colors and no meat to be found.  There is an eclectic collection of owl art and the back room sports some pretty yellowish orange hues. The cute little owls help the ambiance a lot.  The drinks are pretty rad and the specialty cocktail for Halloween was super tasty. Can't go wrong with booze I suppose. My GF had the Brekkie sandwich and it was pretty yummy. My biscuits and gravy on the other hand were a bit concerning. The gravy was like a spicy mortar made for securing your adobe home on the playa, now for eating. I've never had hot gravy that you shape into other food... The biscuit below seemed nice but the spice in the \"gravy\" overshadowed it. I will say the potatoes were super tasty and should have gotten a plate of those as a meal... Service was ok but she was a little frantic in trying to keep up so maybe they were a little understaffed?  I'd like to return for the non brunch menu and give it another go but first impressions are that this place is hit or miss. Hoot."}
{"text":"After trying a vegan chocolate cake from Whole Foods and thinking it was absolutely disgusting, I wasn't sure I'd buy into the vegan deal again.  Alas, my very good friend love love loves this place, so I thought I'd try it with her.    I had the special that day which was billed as vegan, but I added cheddar cheese - fried green tomato sandwich with spicy aioli, with potatoes.  Woah.  So very very good.  I didn't think that vegan bread could be that good, but it was crusty, a little flakey, but soft on the inside... perfect really.  And... I got potatoes to make sure I was full, and they were pretty good, but I'd recommend the kale chips.  You can get potatoes anywhere.  The wait staff was wonderful - we were there at 3, with zero other customers.  The ladies were chatting and hanging out near the bar, but they were very attentive to us - I thought our server read my mind when she appeared with water just as I was thinking that I'd like more.  She was also gracious with my skepticism... not much more I could ask for.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is vegan (although he eats fish now, so what's that? pescan?) and so we went to check this place out shortly after the grand opening with some of our friends.  Tucked away in a cozy corner of Atwood St, the Green Owl definitely exceeded expectations. Specializing in homey comfort vegan/vegetarian cuisine, the meals there are simple but tasty.   My favorites:  The crabby cakes- rich, melt in your mouth flavor. It's hard to imagine that this actually doesn't have an ounce of crab in it. I'd say this is probably one of the best dishes on the menu.   BBQ Jackfruit sandwich- a refreshing take on the pulled pork sandwich. The combination of fresh vinegary coleslaw and the jackfruit was suprising but worked well.   The bread and spread- Green Owl features an appetizer special that features a daily homemade spread. The one we had was a beet and horseradish creation. The odd combination was delightfully tangy and spicy. I could eat tubs of that stuff.   I'm looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"We dined at The Green Owl for dinner on Valentine's Day (a Friday night) and for Sunday brunch.  On Valentine's Day, they had some fancier specials like stuffed shells with garlic bread (all vegan!).  Great spot for regular dining and for special occasions."}
{"text":"ALL VEGETARIAN AND MOSTLY VEGAN  Amazing!!!  Got the crabby cakes, fish sandwich special, and Schnitzel.   Also loads of free deserts. All amazing and great food and i can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"We stopped here for \"brunch\" in early May 2013 on a drive from Providence, RI, to Billings, MT after seeing yelp reviews for vegan/vegetarian places in Madison. The vegan sausage was delicious and the breakfast food in general was very good (I had vegetarian Nuevos Rancheros with vegan chorizo). The coffee was great after driving about 20 hours. The inside of the restaurant looks really cute, especially the paintings on the wall. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great vegan/vegetarian place, and look forward to going back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is the only dedicated, 100% vegetarian restaurant in Madison, WI. 90% of the menu is vegan, but they offer real cheese.  Some of their menu items are really delicious, but other items fall short.   DEVIL WINGS -  So good! I always ask for extra buffalo sauce in lieu of ranch.   RAW TACO PLATE -  Delicious! Their walnut chorizo bursts with flavor and their creamy cilantro jalapeño dressing is the icing on the raw taco cake. I would definitely order this again.   VEGGIE LOAF DINNER - I've been looking for a great vegan meatloaf. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of their walnut loaf version.  SOUTHWEST FILET - Delicious! I omitted the pico de gallo and added some of their chipotle remoulade  ROASTED RED PEPPER CORNBREAD -  Good taste, but my piece was a little hard.  MACHO NACHOS -  I don't like cheese. Didn't like it before I was vegan and I don't like vegan versions. Usually, I can still get some awesome tasting nachos sans cheese. This was not the case at Green Owl Cafe. They were boring and lacked flavor. I wouldn't get them again.   SANTE FE SALAD -  I felt like I paid $11 for a head of iceberg lettuce with a few sprinkles of veggies. This salad was a joke and my wallet was the punchline.  It is over-priced and I would not order this again.   CHERRY CHEESECAKE -  Sweet and decent. Not the best vegan cheesecake, but it's ok.  Despite me not loving everything that I've had, I can't give them less than 4 stars. The good items are great and they get an extra star for being the one and only dedicated-vegery in this town. I'll be returning here on my next visit to MSN."}
{"text":"If your vegan, and you are in town, this is a must visit spot!  Awesome choices and desserts are tasty!! TLT With Avocado.  Was really really good!! I totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"Good but not great vegetarian food. It seems to be more tailored to the vegetarian who is looking for a meat substitute than the one who is just looking for a hearty vegetable-centric meal. As more of the latter, it's never called to me very strongly. Be that as it may, I am always happy to go as the food is perfectly decent, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is cute. Also, they have outdoor seating in the summer which is a plus."}
{"text":"I stopped at Green Owl Cafe for lunch and was not disappointed.  I had the TLT (Tempeh instead of bacon) with Avocado.  The sandwich was very tasty.  The portion was a bit small and left me wishing I had a little more food.  For my side, I got the quinoa.  The quinoa was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.  I'm not even a huge quinoa fan and really enjoyed this side.  We also tried a side of their kale chips for an appetizer.  The chips provided that salty crunch you're looking for and are definitely worth a try.  Overall, this was a good lunch experience."}
{"text":"While in the land of Dairy, figured I'd struggle finding a compassionate place to eat.  A friend of a friend happens to be a vegan chef in Wisconsin and recommended this restaurant to me  Small, but packed full of personality.  The menu was loaded with options and variety.  I ordered the \"crabby cakes\" for appetizer and the Jackfruit quesadilla (vegan cheese and sour cream) for dinner  Smooth, creaming and satisfying flavor - best of all nothing was killed and my dinner guest (a meat eater) experienced satiety without a traditional \"protein\" from a \"Being\".   Service was top notch and when in Madison again, I'll return for sure"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a road trip to Madison this weekend. Honestly, to eat. Vegnews magazine featured Madison to be super vegan friendly, and it did NOT disappoint.  Green owl was lovely. I had the meatloaf dinner which had a lovely tomato reduction sauce, mashed tatoes and gravy, and roasted broccoli! Our app was the crabby cakes. Damn good. Vegan cheesecake for dessert? OK!   Vegan friendly cocktails? YES! I got the strawberry cheesecake martini made with coconut milk. DO NOT SKIP THIS DRINK! Yum!  The service was good, too! Our waitress was very patient. I was overwhelmed to have so many options, something we all know isn't a typical luxury at many restaurants.  Thank you green owl, I can't wait to drive back just to eat your treats!"}
{"text":"Green Owl is out of this world. I could not believe how big their menu was and how delicious each item was!  Green Owl is located in a string of other bars/restaurants in the heart of the Atwood neighborhood. It is a full vegan or vegetarian restaurant, but non-veg friends that have joined me have been very pleased as well.  On our most recent visit, we ordered the raw taco plate as an appetizer. It was good, but not very filling. I was intrigued and also very much enjoyed the \"chorizo\" filling in the lettuce cups.   For dinner, my friend and I both split the jackfruit quesadilla and the TLT (tempeh lettuce tomato). A highlight for the TLT was the Madison Sourdough bread. The jackfruit quesadilla was also quite tasty; I'd recommend that as the best item I've had from there.   Pro tip: they make a homemade jalapeno hot sauce that isn't too spicy. Make sure to ask for it!  We didn't get a chance to try their desserts, but based on the other reviews, I really want to go back and try them!"}
{"text":"Really liked the food here.  Even though the portions are not huge, i thought it was worth the price.  I especially liked thr main courses I tried: the schnitzel and the 'pork' cutlet with spaetzel.  Both are rare on vegan menus, and both delicious.  The crabby patties were excellent as well.  Service was ok for me, but a large group there seemed to have some difficulty."}
{"text":"Road trip weight gain is real, and my efforts to curtail the circumference of my belly during my travels led me to the vegan Green Owl Cafe, where I sought a reprieve from my usual diet of animal products. The Cajun-seasoned tofu and roasted potatoes were delicious, and for a brief moment I felt free from my dogged hunger to feast upon that which was once living. The awkward one-sided date spiraling into the ground next to me couldn't even disturb the peaceful vibe of the cafe. It was a bright summer day, and the server was gracious enough to turn down the sun for those of us seated outside, something I haven't seen accomplished in many, many years. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food for most vegetarians.  I just ate here and had the \"BBQ Pork\" sandwich.  It was a little too sweet because it had too much coleslaw on it, but once I took it off the sandwich, the two separated were delicious!  We tried the curry and bean (or lentil, can't remember) soup that was their soup of the day, and it was extremely addicting, and so was their vegan ranch dressing I had on my side salad.  I honestly can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches there.  The only 2 reasons I only gave this place 3 stars, though, are:  1. Price - $9 got me the sandwich and a side salad, no drink.  When the sandwich came out, I was pretty disappointed in the size of it.  Sure enough, even with the side salad and half of the soup I split with my husband, I wasn't full after my whole meal.  They need to make these portions bigger, give you more sides, or drop their prices.  2. Service - the place was only half full, and there were 3 waitresses.  Ours was nice, nothing overly friendly or rude about her, just nice.  No one seated us right away, nor was there a sign saying if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, so my party of 4 just stood around trying to figure out what to do for about 3 minutes before someone even noticed we were there.  Once we were seated, we had enough time to look at the menu, and our waitress took our order.  The food didn't take too long to come out, but once we did have our food, I asked for more water and my husband asked for some hot sauce.  She only came back with the water after taking another table's order, cleaning the men's bathroom and cleaning 2 tables, by which time I was almost done with my extremely dry meal.  She then came over like she knew all along with the water, didn't apologize for the wait, and filled our glasses and dropped off the bottle of hot sauce (also after my husband was nearly done with his meal).  Lastly, it took her 20 minutes (I'm not kidding) from the time we finished her meal for her to clear our plates and get our checks to us, and that doesn't include running the cards and bringing back our receipts.    Basically, this is a delicious place for extremely good vegetarian and vegan food, and I'm ecstatic that Madison has this cafe here, but in the future I think I'll just order things to go instead of suffer through 2 hours of my life trying to just eat a quick meal (with nothing to drink)."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Were visiting from the Twin Cities and stopped here fora quick dinner and cocktail before a concert. Service was quick and courteous and the food was excellent! Flavorful and fresh. Lots of diverse choices. Our favorite dish was the devil wings, as being a vegetarian doesn't allow us to get anything like that at a restaurant, typically, and they were SO GOOD. Cocktails were wonderful as well."}
{"text":"This place is great, had a veggie loaf dinner and it's bomb. Also had a blueberry lemon poppy seed cheesecake. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"There are many places to eat like this one in Los Angeles...eco-chic decor, funky service staff, eclectic diners...but thus far, this is the ONLY place in town that I have found a place where I can eat ANYTHING on the menu!!  Being in America's Dairyland, I suppose I cannot complain at the scarcity of vegan fare, but finding a place that was created specifically to fill that untapped niche is absolutely fantastic.  I have tried numerous things on their menu, with my favorites either being the BBQ Jackfruit sandwich or the Crab Cake Po'Boy sandwich.  I'm also a fan of their empanadas and gyro specials...and let's not forget dessert!  I don't even care if I'm completely stuffed...I always have to try a new dessert when I come here.  Vegan marshmallow creme?!  Vegan grasshopper cheesecake?!  Yes, please!"}
{"text":"My wife saw a news piece on this restaurant, so we thought we'd give it a try.  I have never eaten in a vegan restaurant before.  I tried the Meatball Sandwich, which had no meat.  My wife had the TLT with Avocado sandwich using gluten free bread.  My sandwich was excellent.  My wife enjoyed her meal as well.  The bread on her sandwich was baked in house, not frozen.  She was amazed at how much it tasted like regular bread.  For dessert, we had Coconut Cream Pie that was Vegan & gluten free and was wonderful.  They really seem to take pride in what they serve and the waitress was very knowledgeable and answered all questions regarding the menu.  We are adding The Green Owl to our list of eateries."}
{"text":"It's always a great find when you encounter a restaurant that looks for inventive ways to serve delicious, healthy food - and The Green Owl Cafe does just that.  My husband loves the BBQ jackfruit sandwich (which on a blind taste test, can be mistaken for pulled pork) and I enjoyed the stuffed red pepper.  Simple in design and flavor, I am also a huge fan of the kale crisps appetizer and have incorporated it into my repertoire of good eats."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great veg/vegan food! And great waitstaff."}
{"text":"Not a vegetarian.  However, decided to try this place.  Had the vegetarian chili and it was mediocre at best.  Tastes like it was made several days in advance.  Salad was good.  The meatball sub was o.k. too.  However, I didn't see much inventiveness.  It was all imitation meals made with fake meat products.  Why no eggplant parmesan sandwich?"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with vegan food. It was EPIC! I had the BBQ Jackfruit sandwich with kale chips. The kale was made perfectly and not burned (according to my companion this is difficult)   We finished with the chocolate lava cake & coconut cream pie. Both were AMAZING! As a non-vegan I was impressed at how much it really tasted like chocolate. I would say these desserts tasted better than any desserts I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I had asked to see 3 items from the dessert menu and they said refused to bring them for me to see. It was a little annoying bc the place was empty but I went ahead and ordered a pistachio cheesecake that was not bad or fantastic. I unfortunately left feeling a little grossed out because when I grabbed two spoons from the utensils section, they were very visibly dirty. I told the waiter at the bar and he noticed that all of the spoons there were dirty and offered to grab me one from the back but I wanted to leave quickly. I am not sure if I will be back, at least not soon."}
{"text":"Awesome! As a vegetarian it's really nice to know you can eat anything and everything off this menu. The buffalo wings are perfection. The meatless loaf and mashed potatoes are great. The brunch sandwich is delicious. Even my meat eater uncle loved the crabby cake poboy he got. Desserts are fantastic. And the drink menu sounds great but I haven't had the chance to try them yet."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I've had dinner here more than a few times and it's such a pleasure to be able to close your eyes, point to the menu and know that whatever you hit upon is going to be not only a vegetarian dish, but tasty and delightful. Stocking local ingredients (and liquor) is a huge plus. Every time I've eaten their food I come away feeling like I've done something good for myself."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best kept secrets in Madison. If you have any food allergies or food preferences... this is the place for you. The waitress can help you make food choices. I am amazed at the delicious food and so many choices! The pastry chef makes gluten and wheat free desserts that are unbelievably delicious. Please try this restaurant, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Green Owl doesn't advertise as a caterer but I wanted a vegetarian wedding and was struggling to find caterers that offered vegetarian cuisine besides pasta and various meals with portabella mushrooms substituting for the meat dish. I asked them on a whim and they agreed. They were very casual and we usually had to remind them about deadlines and things but they got everything done we needed in the end and were very pleasant to work with. Unlike many catering companies, they were extremely accommodating with menu requests through the wedding planning process. They worked with us on the many ideas we had for the menu and also provided great suggestions. For instance, my (now) husband loves beets and wanted to add them into one of the dishes but we weren't sure it would go well. A few days later I got an e-mail from Jenny with an appetizer suggestion -- crostinis with goat cheese and heart-shaped roasted beets (get it? heart-beet! I uploaded a picture because they were so darn cute). They were a total hit at the wedding and super delicious. In fact, we got rave reviews on all the food from our guests. Prices were similar to other caterers but we think we got more bang for our buck than if we'd gone elsewhere (ex. way more variety on appetizers). If your wedding is 100 people or fewer, Green Owl can also provide dishware and glassware which was much more convenient than having to rent those from another company. Overall, we really enjoyed Green Owl and would definitely recommend them for your vegetarian/vegan catering needs!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this place out and I must say, I am impressed!   The restaurant was super cute. It seemed to be well laid out, I liked the bright and fun colors of the walls, and it was super clean which is always a good sign. It was pretty warm inside - they had the front door open (it was a beautiful day) but the fresh air didn't quite it make all the way in to the place. I would have preferred it to be a bit cooler inside but that wasn't a big deal.   The food was great! We started with the devil wings. SO GOOD! I would absolutely order these again.   I went with the jackfruit quesadilla and my mom went with the pesto alfredo.   The quesadilla was really yummy. It was a little dry - I would order it again, but I would get a sauce to dip on the side for sure. It was really filling. The rice that came on the side was really nice as well - it was a light and fresh flavor. Paired well!   My mom said her pasta was also super yummy. It looked really good, and I think I might try that next. It came with garlic bread as well. The bread was tasty!   Overall, I like this place. I will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Was good...TLT with avocado delish.. Reasonably priced.. I just went there again and had the jackfruit BBQ which was good along with the kale chips as a side that was surpassingly good."}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seating. Specializing in vegan and vegetarian cuisine. Plenty of variety. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Best vegan options that I've found in Madison.  I will travel for good vegan food, and this is worth it.  I wish there were more places like this in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Best Sandwiches- actually, in general best vegan dinner spot in town. I never have to worry if there's meat or dairy in my food :) and raw food nights are amazing!"}
