{"text":"Fortune Food is right on Centre Street and 23rd Ave N. It's a tiny shop with freezers full of frozen dim sum products for you to buy and take home. They also have a full menu for take out. It's more of a grocer and take out place rather than a restaurant. They have about four tables and no one really uses them.  I was sent this way because my reliable mother recommended it, and you know, mothers know best. It went like this:  Me: Mother, I have a dilemma. Mom: What is it, dear? Me: I have to bring dumplings to a pot luck. Can you tell me where I can find good frozen dumplings? Mom: Lucky Supermarket has great frozen dumplings, but dumplings are only good if they are hot and crispy. You should go to Fortune Food and ask them to make them hot and fresh for you.  So I took her advice and called Fortune Food, placed an order of 40 dumplings, and asked them to pan-fry them so they would be fresh and crispy when I pick them up. I arrived to pick up my order and sure enough they were hot and crispy and fresh. They recognized me right away, and I think they gave me a discount because it was a lot cheaper than I expected.  I was reading forums online and some people said the quality went downhill. From my recent experience, the shop was cute, the service was great, and the dumplings were delicious. I couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"Your run of the mill hole in the wall Chinese dim sum place. The food is only average. The wonton noodle soup was merely average at best. Not very flavorful and quite bland. We ordered a side of gai lan with oyster sauce and it was quite difficult to eat since the stalks were left whole and not cut in half. I'm not sure why restaurants do that. The chiu chow fun gor had a nice filling however the skin was too thick. It had a nice chewy texture but too thick and doughy. They have a decent selection of frozen dim sum items for you to purchase to steam at home. Service is pretty much non existent though so don't expect much in that respect."}
{"text":"Very reasonably price for the quality.  I like the early hours. Quick and friendly service. Good is good.  There's frozen dim sum as well."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from Fortune so when I get a craving for Dim-Sum a visit to Fortune is a must. It's not the greatest dim-sum but when you're by yourself and just need a Har Gow or Siu Mai fix then this is the place to go. They have frozen dim-sum that you can take home and finish cooking yourself or you can take home freshly cooked items or even stay in and get table service. At lunchtime the kitchen is open to take orders for fried rice and fried noodle dishes or bowls of wonton soup. This service ends by 2 p.m. If you like Canton Chow Mein or wonton soup then be sure to try it here. They do these dishes well. The Har Gow is on the tiny side but still a decent version; so is the Siu Mai, I often also get the Lor Mai Kai which is the glutinous rice with meat wrapped in lotus leaf. The staples of dim-sum are well done here. The portions are smaller than you can get in bigger establishments but you're not fighting traffic and trying to find parking in Chinatown. The Singapore Fried Rice noodles are also a good option. Prices for dim-sum are around $3.50-$3.95, fried rice and noodles are around $9-10.  There are only about 6 tables in the place so it's first come first-served. The parking lot can be busy depending on times; there is a registry office and a couple of other businesses sharing the lot."}
{"text":"One of those great when you just need some simple dim sum and noodles kind of places. Very small but good food. Had some dumplings, singapore noodles, broccoli with garlic, soup dumplings, rice rolls, congee and a few others.  All items were solid. Definitely one of my go to simple chinese places."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for decent dim sum at a small mom and pop restaurant without the lineups and the fuss. The restaurant is small and only has about 6 tables.  You can order most dim sum dishes and they also have noodles, congee and veggies. We found they had lots of vegetarian items compared to other dim sum restaurants.   Sometimes, when I have a craving I stop by to grab the bbq pork buns that they make fresh everyday - they are mini and they come in a tray of 6 for under $5. My favourites to order are the har gow, siu mai, dumplings, rice rolls, singapore noodles and the siu gow. They also have a bunch of stuff that they sell in the freezer so you can make a lot of the food at home. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars: 1) food is de-li-cious..... Uber yummy 2) dim sum.......all day...yahoooooo 3.)

Coz I thought for the longest time I thought they only sell frozen dimsums....No No..No.. Was I wrong! They serve dim sum all day. Your typical kinda short order Chinese food...simple..almost like noodle house. I have some pics their very simple menu. Sorry its kinda blurry.. I would say it's a hidden jem.  The place is small. They sell frozen dim sum as well to bring home. They cook the food fast and good.  Its by the Registries plus I think and there's comic bookstore, insurance place. Its in a small plaza.  Go in, check it out specially if you love dimsum..boy was I glad when I did..."}
