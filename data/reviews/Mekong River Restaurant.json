{"text":"the food at this restaurant is authentic, and delicious, more than i can say for some other neighborhood favorites. what this restaurant lacks is atmosphere. it is gloomy and uncomfortably cold. there is nothing worse than having to eat dinner with your coat on. so, i don't eat here as often as i would like, i  do take out."}
{"text":"good authentic food, huge menu, good service. great for Thai or Cambodian. the food  can get pretty spicy so be careful when ordering. they use a scale of 1-10 for spiciness i think  I ordered a 8 once and it was way too spicy and i really like spicy."}
{"text":"This Thai place is quite good. Food had: Tom ka Khai (spelling might be wrong - the coconut chicken milk soup) , shrimp rolls, and Yellow Curry with Chicken.  Everything was good, and the curry was very good .the shrimp rolls were a bit small for the price.   Place would have gotten 4 stars but the service was just barely average. No reason for this, we were the only people in the place, but food took a while, menu recommendations were nonforthcoming (and when I asked if they had larb, a classic thai dish, she laughed) and the waitress didn't check in to see if we needed anything as often as she could have given that the place was empty.  Overall though, food is very good for the area and service may be better on a busier time"}
{"text":"I ease recommended to this place by a friend and so I went thee looking for high expectations, after all my fried claimed thaythid was the best place to get Thai food. Truth be told I was a little disappointed by the food which admittedly I only tried the Thai food and only once. However I thought that the way they had made the tastes was not that impressive nor was the presentation or anything else really. Not to say that this place is bad really, its just that if you want some good Thai food you can look towards Lemongrass or Map of Thailand instead. Based what I saw at that restaurateur I don't think that I will be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I've been here many times over the years, but the food seems to be getting really good lately. Do yourself a favor and skip the chain Asian food at Legacy Village and support a local place."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but service was absolutely abysmal!  Worst I have ever seen in America.  Our server seemed like a 15 yr old kid, and he didn't shy away from making us feel unwelcome.  I got there several minutes after my friend did, and soon after sitting down, got asked my this juvenile if I was ready to order.  I wasn't and he was displeased.  He rarely came to our table the whole night, and completely lacked patience and manners.  Even worse, a second much more chubbier shorter round faced balding waiter got into a fight with an older middle-aged customer.  This customer was mad that his party had already waited for an hour or so to be served dinner and were never told to expect that kind of wait.  The chubby waiter got mad at him in return and said he would call the police if this customer did not pay up for what he had eaten so far (I assume the customer already got his appetizers).  Customer and his wife then got into an argument with each other.  The now stammering customer got mad at the waiter and at his wife.  Customer got up to leave, but his chair fell down with the jacket on it.  Customer attempted to pick up his jacket, but it fell down and he had to redo the pickup.  I forgot to say that this customer was very tall, but he was clearly not co-ordinated.  The chubby shorter rude waiter was somewhat scary looking, but still not Mike Tyson scary.  I was on the customer's side, but not because he had to wait for the food.  More so because both the waiters were terrible.  The only other waiter was quite nice, but they clearly needed more waiters on this busy night.  All in all, an entertaining change of pace in my generally safe suburban life, but not fun for many customers who were there.  Some left because they realized that dinner would be served an hour after they ordered, while others felt uncomfortable after the scene."}
{"text":"Best Thai/Cambodian restaurant I've been too, and I have been going to it many years.  As another poster posted comments about the waiters...I have been waited by all of them, and all of them have been kind and friendly, and the best part, personal.  I always tip them pretty well, and the food is wonderful.  Any curry is great, and try the bubble teas they are awesome.    My fiance likes to try different restaurants, and we actually went to another Thai restaurant (Ty Fun) for her birthday.  Ty Fun (somewhere in Cleveland) didn't compare to Mekong, but it was pretty funny, it was like a house that had a restaurant on it's first floor, and a complete rip off.  Ty Fun is one of those places where it pretends to be fancy (even though the restaurant is in a house), but the tables are wobbly and you end up paying $$$ and you are hungry after dinner.    I'll be going to Mekong River as long as I'm in the area."}
{"text":"my favorite asian spot in the heights is now closed. where is thaf family going im following them."}
{"text":"Mekong River serves both Thai and Cambodian dishes, but go for the Cambodian for a more unique experience.  I've been many times and have always been pleased.  The place seems to do more take-out business than dine-in, so don't be put off if you're one of the only ones in the restaurant.  Also, don't expect it to have ambience. The interior is spare, even ugly.  A TV over the bar always seems to have Cambodian programs on, and I've never seen anyone other than staff in the bar area.  A combination of live and fake plants and some paintings of Angkor Wat complete the scene.  It's all about the food, which is just fine for me.  I think the location hurts it.  Except when nearby Cain Park has summer concerts or other events, people who dine out just don't seem to venture north of Cedar Road, opting instead for the strip of popular restaurants just south of Cedar. Well, they're missing some great food!"}
{"text":"I love a family owned business where the owners take pride in servicing the customer. The menu is interesting, the food freshly prepared and tasty and the service friendly and quick. The ambiance is not much to speak of but that can be overlooked. With a lack of good Asian food in the eastern suburbs this place is a top choice. Try the crystal noodle soup. It comes with crunchy fried garlic on top. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. I was a bit bothered by the cleanliness of the place. The table was sticky and the menu had some food residue on it. But it didn't stop me from chowing down on the large portion of pad thai.   The decoration inside is very informal, heavy on imported thai and cambodian kitch. So I think next time it will be just right for takeout."}
{"text":"The best Cambodian restaurant in town. If you like Thai food, you will like this restaurant. They have a very big menu and a good selection of vegetarian dishes. The dishes are so big,  I guarantee you won't be able to finish it. When I go, I like to go with a large group so I can  try different dishes."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. Tasty food, reasonably priced, and gracious service."}
{"text":"Like a reviewer said before me, the more popular Lemongrass (located in the old McDonald's building on Lee) truly pales in comparison.  Here it is not only authentic, but the menu is extraordinary in size and quality. Try the samlaw machu kati....your choice of meat with eggplant and peppers in a savory green tamarind curry. This place has the usual red, green and yellow curries, but it has both thai and cambodian sauces as well, all made by the family that runs the place. They have pad thai (excellent!) but also have many other pasta choices.  It is quiet and a good place to take a date or your family. Be adventurous....order a dish you've never tried and you will be back to do it again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 15 years. It has consistently offered yummy and authentic Thai/Cambodian/Khmer food. They make the beast Pad Thai in Cleveland, hands down. The curries are good, the jade noodles, the soups, the spring rolls and Mango with sticky rice all great. Tonight I picked up a Green Papaya salad and, for the first time, was a bit disappointed. In fact, it had so much raw garlic (which I believe one can never have too much of) that I could not eat it. I'll try again tomorrow, but that's a salad that really bites back. I also got the Mekong Garden, a vegetable and tofu medley topped with a peanut sauce. Nice, the vegetables were perfectly cooked,. but the sauce was a bit sweet for me.   Yum! Pad Thai! And did I mention the portions are HUGE?"}
{"text":"I must say that this restaurant has some of the best Thai food ever.  I will admit the decor is a bit dated and worn, in dire need of an update, however the food will put your mind at ease.  I ordered the Mekong Jade Noodle and the Thai curry puffs and they were cooked to perfection.  I believe each time I go, I order the same thing and I am always very satisfied.  I went on a Monday evening and there were no other customers while I was there and it appeared maybe the owner was doing double duty at the server, so I didn't see him much.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. We found it by Yelping and thought we'd try it out. The food & service were great.  We ordered the Papaya Salad and Vegetarian Rolls as appetizers. They were great. The papaya salad had great flavor and the vegetarian rolls were perfectly crispy with minimal oil.  For our entrees, I ordered the Panang curry with shrimp and my friend ordered a scallop dish. They were flavorful and the seafood was cooked well. The portions were large so we had lunch the next day too.  Our waiter was kind and made excellent suggestions for what we should try in the future."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area from the San Francisco bay area where Thai and Cambodian restaurants are very common due to large communities of immigrants from those countries.  Therefore, I have been able to sample many throughout my lifetime and find some of the best the country has to offer.  Also, having eaten at the Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas, which is often regarded as the best Thai in the country including their secret North Thai menu.    The Mekong River Restaurant is one of the best places I have had these cuisines at.  They make legitimate Thai and Cambodian dishes and will make it properly hot if you ask.  I'm not sure what sort of background the rest of the reviewers have, but it seems they are looking for the very Americanized style of large portions and bland flavors - they should stick to Stouffers.  Since Cleveland is being regarded now as an upcoming \"foodie town,\" if you truly want to expand your palate, you should try this place.  Also, take the owner's recommendations for authentic Cambodian dishes.  He recommended the Samlaw Machu Kahti (no oil) with beef, and I could actually taste each ingredient even though there are 12.  I also had their Green Curry and it was delicious as well.  If you haven't had this type of food before, I would start with the Pad Thai, but you have to go beyond that because it is a pretty novice dish.  Their website is actually: http://mekongriverinc.com/  Also, it seems they have remodeled since the \"dirty\" reviews.  It was actually pretty pleasant inside."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Mekong River last night. It was really crowded due to the Cain Park art show across the street, but we only waited about 10 minutes for a table.   To start we shared the pot stickers which were light and crispy served with a flavorful sauce. My friend had the Tom Yum soup which we seemed to enjoy.   Entrees were large, flavorful, pungent (in a good way) and hot!  I had 63 (don't ask me to name it) and I loved it. I really enjoyed the amount of veggies...more veggies than meat. One diner had the green curry which he loved. It was a bit different than other green curries, but he liked it. The other person had the pork and eggplant which she enjoyed. The flavors were out of control and everything was very fresh.   We will definitely be back.  Glad we stopped. Oh, and we will be eating the leftovers for dinner. You can easily share a dish if you like."}
{"text":"I was a little underwhelmed by my visit to Mekong River.  I've always heard great things, and I finally got the chance to go for dinner with a friend.  Like the other reviews here, we dined with only a few other tables of customers.  The restaurant is indeed too cool for for comfort: I ate my meal with my North Face winter coat on to stay warm.  The service was not great.  There was only one waiter, and I'm inclined to guess that he was also doing some work in kitchen preparing food.  He was very polite and very helpful when he could come to the table, and he was very apologetic about the service being so bad (his words).  The food was pretty good.  My dish, a run of the mill noodle dish with veggies, was okay.  I asked for level 5 (of 10) spiciness, but it came to me with what tasted like no heat added.  I was a little disappointed.  I would've asked the waiter if he had any chili or hot sauce, but as I said, his infrequent visit to the table prevented me from doing so.  My friend ordered curry, which was very delicious and hearty.  The portions made the meal a good deal.  We also ordered a pot of tea for the table.  It was brewed strong and had s delightful flavor.  If I were to eat here again, I would probably just get takeout and try one of the curry dishes (my review would probably raise to 3 stars in that case).  The price is good for the portions, which are very big."}
{"text":"Mekong River is the best!  I've been going to this restaurant for years---it's family owned and I've seen the entire family grow up with the place.  The massaman curry is amazing and I have trouble ordering anything else. There are plenty of other great things to order, though, and I don't think you can miss.   The atmosphere is very quaint but the staff is attentive and remembers repeat customers."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the only thing thats really worth coming back for is the Thai food.  The portions are huge.  Pad Thai and Thai Currys are great.  And you can ask them to adjust the spices to your level."}
{"text":"4 stars for our first visit to this hole-in-the-wall restaurant!  Mekong River was recommended to us by a friend who is Cambodian as one of the areas best Cambodian restaurants. Though I live really close to Mekong River, I've always been a little skeptical of it as a suburban, Americanized Asian restaurant. It turned out to be really good!  We asked the waiter what he would recommend as authentic Cambodian food, and he mentioned #59, Chha Kreoung. He also mentioned #63 and #64, Samlaw Machu Kreoung and Samlaw Machu Kahti as close favorites that had really good flavor. We ended up going with #59 Chha Kreoung with shrimp and tofu. The flavors were really good - sweet, sour, and spicy with plenty of basil, and the spices were right on. (The beau used to live in the Bay Area and ate regularly at a Cambodian restaurant.)  We also got the Cambodian Curry with tofu. I really enjoyed this one. It was more on the sweeter side and had lots of veggies - potatoes, yams, green peppers, onions, etc in a really good peanut curry sauce. Yum.  The portions were pretty big, and so we had lots of leftovers! Good stuff. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went for dinner there. My son is in Cambodia, he suggested a dish called Loc Lac. I tried it, very flavorful and light sauce your choice of meat or vegetarian served on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes. I will definitely go there again and take out."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've had so far in Cleveland! (This is saying a lot considering I used to work at a Thai restaurant!) I'm a huge fan of their garlic fried rice and beef pad see ew.  One thing to remember is that their spice levels are pretty intense. The scale ranges from 1-10, and a 5 will get you a reallllllly spicy dish!   Something I don't recommend getting are their bubble teas. The taste was just so off and the boba balls were too hard to chew :( But otherwise, service is GREAT and food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant meal and I'm certain to return to explore the rest of the menu. The food is fresh and tasty. The service is prompt and friendly. And the restaurant is affordable.  I had the Vietnamese spring rolls which were a revelation. I never understood the appeal but these were delicious. Dessert was a home made coconut ice cream. It was very good but gritty. It was Mekong River's bad luck that I'd just recently had a far superior home made coconut ice cream at a different restaurant.   My entree was seafood green curry. The shrimp and scallops were nice and the mussels were wonderful but my overall impression of the dish was that it was mediocre.  Hence my reserved rating."}
{"text":"I was being adventurous and decided to try this place out.  I got there early since I went straight from work and there was only one other table occupied when I sat down but it got busier as the hour went on.  I wanted to try a few different things so I ordered the vegetable Thai curry puff (basically a potato samosa with sweet potato. Good but I was hoping it would have been more like the Indian samosa.  The puff was served with peanut sauce. I got the vegetable coconut soup which I thought was really good and not a very strong coconut taste.   This was my favorite dish of the evening. I also ordered vegetable nam chao which is veggie rice paper wrap.  I told you I wanted to try several different dishes!  The wrap had fresh ingredients with a good dipping sauce. And to top off the meal I got a thai coffee to go which was really good.  Wait staff was ok but apparently one guy was handling the floor and seemed to get stressed when tables started to fill up, but since I wasn't in a hurry I didn't mind.  It was a good dining experience.  I only gave 3 stars because reserve 4 and 5 stars for amazing meals and don't give those out very often.  I would recommend the place."}
{"text":"I love this place. And ive been coming here for many many years and each time was perfect. The food the service everything. I got the Crepe with beef and it was so flavorful and delicious and the chicken Satay was outstanding as well. i highly recomend it. The only suggestion that i have is that they should switch to cloth napkins or atleast a better kind of paper napkin because the ones there are really flimsy and thin."}
{"text":"Came here over and over and over throughout grad school.  The portions are generous (especially compared to other Asian restaurants in the area), the service is always great, and, most importantly, the food is delicious.   I have several favorites, but I must admit I like every dish I've tried here.  My favorites are the Mekong String Beans with Tofu, the Panang Curry with Tofu, and the Mango curry with Tofu.  Make it spicy and the food is undeniably awesome, especially because the prices aren't sky-rocket high."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying what this place is not: pretentious, too chic for you, expensive.  Rather this place is everything that is good about Cambodia, especially when you compare it to Thailand: it's down-to-earth, authentic, AND family-friendly.  I went there with a group (and one baby) and every single person enjoyed their dish.    I got the spicy squid (there is also a Thai version of this dish) and I enjoyed it tremendously.  It was spicy enough (hard to find in the U.S.) and also not over-cooked (very easy to do with squid). My husband had the curry beef and he enjoyed his dish as well.  How do I sum up this restaurant?  It's not really a place you would want to take a first date to, instead, it's where you take that very special lady that you've been on many many dates with (and maybe have a baby with) and you two order something that you know the other person will want a taste of.  We've already been here twice in one month!  Side-note:  We loved our waiter!  He's this punk Cambodian kid with cool tattoos who sounds a little like Keanu Reeves.  What's not to love? :)"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Mekong River today, and I liked every dish we ordered; Samlaw Machu Kahti with Beef(We ordered it because someone recommened this dish on the review!), Melong Jade Noodle and Cabbage Fried Rice w/Tofu. Samlaw Machu Kahti is Beef, Green Beans, Eggplant in a Coconut Milk Curry sauceI which is intense and very tasty. They seasoned it just right. I like the Jade Noodle from a Thai restaurant on Coventry, so I tried it out the one here. This one is more wet and has intense flavor. I kept saying GOOD like 20 times. The highlight of the dinner was Cabbage Fried Rice. Instead of ordering a regular House fried rice, we tried out this SPICY fried rice and we customized it with spicy level 6! It was way too spicy to eat. I probly shoud've chosen level 2-3. This restaurant uses fresh ingredients like Green beans, snow peas, onions, shiitake mashrooms etc... the taste is real. (Again, not like most of Chinese restaurants where they use frozen veggies on their fried rice). They have 94 dishes on the menu to choose from and their Fried Rice and Curry variety are impressive. Though maybe the atmosphere of this restaurant is not ideal for a date night, their great tasty food will definitely make a great conversation for sure."}
{"text":"I only tried the thai food here, so i cant comment on the cambodian dishes.  We ordered the green curry, beef with vegetables, basil noodle.  The curry was above average and the other 2 dishes were below average.   I thought the food was pretty good, but about average.  Nothing to brag about, but it does fill you up.  Portion sizes are generous, and they refill the rice whenever you wish.  The thai tea is about average as well.  By the time our food arrived, most of the ice had melted in the thai tea.  I am not from the area, so cant comment on if this is the best thai place in town or not.  But overall its decent, especially if you are hungry"}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, the best Thai restaurant on the east side of Cleveland, although it pales in comparison with Thai Kitchen, the hole-in-the-wall in Lakewood on the west side.  I want to give this restaurant five stars because I feel like it is a five-star restaurant, but I hold back because it is really not in the same category as Thai Kitchen, which I gave five stars.  I think that this would easily be a five star restaurant in any city other than Cleveland, but here the standard is too high.  The food here is always good: the flavors are vibrant and the prices are very reasonable, relative to what you get.  The atmosphere is very dark...perhaps a tad gloomy, but nice.  Service is good.  This place also will make a number of dishes that are not on the menu, if you come with guests that know how to describe them!  And I can say from experience that although I cannot pronounce the names of these dishes, they were all quite excellent!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Unlike anything I ever tasted, but delicious, no matter what I order off the menu, it's good. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I used to think that Lemon Grass had the best pad thai in town but after trying the pad thai at Mekong River, I've seen the light. Somehow they're pad thai tastes light and delicious but it's definitely filling. It's chock full of bean sprouts, chicken and shrimp. Every dish I've tried I've been extremely satisfied with. If you like spicy food they have some great dishes. Just be warned that if you ask for it hot, it will really come to you hot so be prepared for some spice and have a glass of water handy."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. The service was top notch the two times I've been here. Very well-mannered, attentive, fast, and they know their way around the menu. Good enough for me to bump the rating to 3 stars from 2.  Now for the not so good. The first time I came here I decided to pop my Khmer cherry. I asked our waiter for a recommendation and he pointed out two dishes I can't remember the name of (or chose to forget). They were both \"samlaw\" dishes... curries with a variety of veggies in a tangy brownish green sauce. I have a fearless appetite and can devour almost anything anyone throws at me, even the most authentic, stinky, unappealing dish that exists... but these were two dishes I just could not gulp down. The brownish green poo-water appearance didn't phase me. It was the funky smell and taste. I ate enough to curb my appetite and got a to-go box for the rest, which I ended up tossing.   On my second visit I got their pad thai, which everyone seems to rave about and claim as east side's best. Eh. To their credit, it's probably the hugest portion I've seen anywhere, and I know you read that everywhere, but here it's actually true. It was ENORMOUS. Still though, that wasn't enough to make up for its shortcomings: very little meat, too many bean sprouts, and not enough flavor. Bangkok Thai still claims the title as east side's best.  So yeah... impressions are not so great. I can't really hold the funky samlaw dishes against them because maybe it just wasn't my kinda thing. I am determined find a Khmer dish that I like, so I may return eventually."}
{"text":"I never noticed the restaurant until a friend recommended coming here for dinner one night. I go down Lee road all the time, but somehow kept missing this place...silly me.   I've eaten here twice so far, and had good food both times. Sometimes with Asian restaurants you worry whether they serve authentic Asian cuisine, or a more Americanized \"fusion\" version of Asian food. Luckily, this place serves the former rather than the latter.   I came here both times with a group of friends. Their menu is quite big, so there are plenty of dishes to choose from. Some of my friends are vegetarian, and it's great to see a good number of options for them besides the typical salad! The servers are very nice, and if you have any questions about any of the dishes they are more than happy to answer them. I couldn't make up my mind about which dish I wanted this time around, fortunately, our server was kind enough to list some recommendations for me to try. We ordered the following: papaya salad (this has a good kick to it!), veggie rolls, seafood dynasty, samlaw korko- tofu (#61), samlaw machu kahti- tofu (#64), mi chha noodles- shrimp, veggie pad thai, and two soups- tom yum goong and mekong soup. We tried each others' dish, which is the great thing about dining out with a group of friends! My favorite was the samlaw korko! The sauce was delicious with zucchini and rice. With southeast Asian cuisine, it's a great mix of sour, sweet, citrusy, salty, and spicy  foods. They often use pungent fish oil, shrimp paste, garlic, and ginger etc. to make their delicious dishes...and I must say I love every bit of it! This place is worth a try if you haven't been here already! Warning, the portions are pretty big, so remember to share...sharing is caring!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Thai food, but this place has some delicious food.  I've only been here a handful of times and each time I've gotten the Pad Thai.  SOOOOOO GOOD!  I don't want to try anything else for fear it will make me not want the Pad Thai anymore.  The staff is very attentive at making sure your beverages stay full and your meal is good.  It is also very reasonably price and you'll probably end up having leftovers (hello, late night snack or lunch for the next day)."}
{"text":"Heard some good things about Mekong and I'm a big fan of thai food.  I dug the soup I got (veggie coconut soup), and my veggie and tofu masaman curry was pretty good, but my dude got some kind of shrimp special dish and that's was not that great.  Overall pretty good, but not entirely sure that I'm dying to go back."}
{"text":"Great Cambodian cuisine.  Big portions, and service was pretty good (then again it's hard to mess up service when there is only one other couple in the restaurant).  I usually do not know how to pronounce the name of the dishes, so I just point and say the number on the menu, and every thing I've ordered has been delicious.    Plus they have bubble tea!  I do like Phnom Penh on W 25th street better but Mekong River takes credit card which is a big plus."}
{"text":"I had thought I tried all of the Thai restaurants in the vicinity of Cleveland Heights - Tree Country Bistro, Lemon Grass, and High Thai'd.  So I was surprised when my friend told me that there was yet another Thai restaurant nearby which I hadn't tried.  I  like Thai food with a moderate level of spice and a good mix of flavors.  I ordered the salmon choo-chee, which is a dish with salmon and vegetables in red curry that I've also had in High Thai'd and Peppermint Cafe.  The food was okay, but I wasn't super impressed.  The standard spice level was not terribly spicy and I thought the salmon was a little better in the other Thai restaurants that I usually go to.    One plus was the enormous portion size.   The dish I ordered could have fed two people who are moderately hungry."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Khmer (Cambodian) and Thai food. Don't miss the coconut ice cream. Really enjoyed the Cambodian dishes."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorites, but I can't go back. They've fed me a lot of meat without telling me! (I'm vegetarian.)  They have a \"Vegetarian\" Menu but almost all of the items on it have fish sauce, which is not stated anywhere. That would rate 3 stars for me since at least I do like the dishes I CAN eat. Plus they have some unusual bubble tea flavors.  But I subtract another star because they don't give a straight answer about which items are mis-labeled vegetarian and which truly are (or which can be modified on request). They are always VERY friendly, understand the question, and go back to the kitchen to find out. No complaints there.  But... On three different occasions I was give three DIFFERENT answers (always with confidence and reassuring details) on which dishes I can eat. So, even after becoming aware that their vegetarian menu is mis-labeled, I was apparently still served meat two times. Which of the three times did I get a truly vegetarian meal? I will never know.  So that's that. Sadly, they must be crossed off my list."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Always the same, courteous service. Have had about 15 dishes and only one was sub-par. The Coconut Chicken Soup is always ridiculous and the Cambodian Crepes are an amazing balance of textures and flavors.  This place is my first choice of foodie friendly restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out from here on a Monday night. I ordered the Samlaw Machu Kreoung and was told it would take 20 minutes, but it was ready when I showed up in ten. The place looks pretty run down inside and smells a little funky, so I don't think I would choose to dine in. Service was very polite and super-fast. The food was awesome and unique, but be warned-- when they mark something as spicy, they mean it! This is not toned down for American tastes, and it was a bit too hot for me, and I do like spicy food (I ended up picking out about 2 peppers worth of slivered jalapeño). Still, the dish was complex and aromatic, and I will definitely order from here again! They only lose a star for the unappealing interior."}
{"text":"I'm slightly bemused when people offer strong opinions about Thai food and then take me to their \"favorite\" Thai restaurant (such as High Thai'd), where the food is invariably too bland for my palate.  Not so at Mekong River, which is just a few blocks away from Coventry central.  In terms of spice level, Mekong is pretty on-target, and the portions are indeed kingly.  We had the Pad See Ew with Chicken and the Pork Fried Rice.  Both dishes gave me the distinct feeling and comfort of eating in someone's home.  Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I honestly did not expect to find Cambodian food in Cleveland Heights... I don't even really know what sets Cambodian food apart from other types of Asian food, but this place is quite good.  The actual building itself is pretty crappy looking, which usually means that the food is good.  There is a nice freshly paved parking lot around the back of the building which is good... I hate having to find quarters for the meters.  The decor is pretty interesting and pretty typical of most Asian restaurants.  The place was very empty, though we did go on a Sunday evening.  There only seemed to be one guy working, but he was very friendly.  I had the green curry, which was just the right blend of sweet and spicy.  It was among the better green curries that I've had.  It was also among the most expensive, which is one of the few downsides of the place.  There doesn't seem to be, at least from my perspective, any reason why this place charges at least a few $ more per dish than most Asian food places.  The portions are typical and the ingredients don't seem to be overly special...  Id give this place 3.5 stars, rounding up for the good service.  I might come back again to try something else, but I don't think this place will become part of the regular going out rotation."}
