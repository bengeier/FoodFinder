{"text":"I'm way into this spot. Flatbreads and kale salad delivered what I needed before a night out. Decor is thoughtful and hip. Would return, especially since the hotel itself is great too."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had, so tender. Also tried the Buffalo chicken sandwich which was excellent. I wasn't too impressed with the chicken bacon club. However, I got onion rings and they were the best onion rings I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Dead as a cactus in here. Food was bland or too many flavors all mixed together. No need for a box.. No one seems to know what's going on here? Is this even a restaurant? Did it exsist before today? Who knows."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my first visit to this restaurant wasn't excellent. Our party of 5 decided to eat at the hotel restaurant for breakfast unstead of trekking out to Old Town. Upon arrival, there was a wait to be sat even though we were the only guests there. It was extremely chilly inside so our group asked if we could sit outside and were denied with \"It's too hot outside, you might not make it.\" Which we found odd. The server, while nice, needed to be trained more. He was very slow and unsure of what he was doing. The food took way too long to arrive and when it came, it was either cold, missing ingredients that were listed on the menu, or didn't taste good. The 5 people in my party left hungry. Needless to say, we won't be back for breakfast.

The only reason I'm leaving 2 stars instead of 1, is because of the cute decor."}
{"text":"I ordered carnitas and chicken tacos. Tasted delicious but parts of the pork was dried out like it had been sitting out all day. Not good!"}
{"text":"Great place to have some breakfast after a long day at the pool the night before! Freshly squeezed orange juice combined with eggs, toast and bacon is a must !"}

{"text":"Simple, honest and fresh food!

Great crab cakes,
Delicious sweet potatoes fries,
Proper Club sandwich ( with thick bacon ),
Nice spearguns, 
And good cocktails."}
{"text":"I had lunch here during my stay and the food was so good!! The guacamole was amazing and so were the sweet potato fondue fries - we ate them so quickly we didn't get a picture!"}
{"text":"Great back patio - tucked away from old town. Enjoyed the mushroom flatbread and big kale salad. Spicy margarita is recommended! Excellent service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food menu is scaled down delicious.  Modern fare with a few comfortable staples.  

Avocado toast was perfect!
Ceviche was fresh and a nice combo between slaty and sweet 
Cookies and ice cream was yummy!
Mac n cheese was pretty nice too except we had a bit of a sharp piece of clear plastic in the dish which caught us by surprise.  The hotel did not seem to care about that. 

The chicken club was more bread than anything else."}
{"text":"Well we gave it two chances as we were staying at the hotel. 

Breakfast- fake eggs from a carton, unbuttered room temp toast with a side of cold butter, potato so salty you need a glass of water with every bite and bacon that seemed or possibly was microwaved. All this can be yours for $16 or you can go to a franchised breakfast place and pay $4.99. I'd choose the franchise if this meal is what you desire. 

Lunch- French fries so salty you can't eat them and a burger ordered medium and delivered rare. Best part is after it's dropped off no one ever comes back. So you don't even get the opportunity to say something.

The cook clearly smokes and has lost the sense of taste which is so critical to cooking. The heavy use of salt is a dead giveaway. No one in the kitchen is inspired. 



Menu says it opens at 6:30am and website says 7:00am"}
{"text":"What a great spot to grab a cocktail and some lite bites! Highly recommend!"}
