{"text":"This is absolutely the best restaurant and grocery for Jamaican food. Since moving here from New York last year, I've been on the search to find good Jamaican food and I'm so glad I found this place. It's a half hour drive from my house and it's well worth the drive. The service of the staff is great, they make you feel so welcomed in their store. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Jamaican beef patties here are really tasty! The service is ok, and the stew chicken is fall off the bone tender. I've eaten here a few times and the service tends to be friendly, but the food is what keeps me coming back. The cabbage and rice are a little plain, but when you mix everything together: YUMMY"}
{"text":"Real Jamaican Here, Food is official !!l... You lames get over yourself, its a mom and pop so enjoy the experience good or Bad.. You go into Walmart and any supermarket and deal with the same issues... Human interaction... Facts.. Love this place, Food and all the Yard grocery a Rude Buoy Need..."}
{"text":"I'm from Ft. Lauderdale, FL and miss having several options in regards to where I can get authentic Jamaican food. My boyfriend and I found Island Grocery on the Internet and decided to give it a try. The fact that they have a jamaican grocery section in their store AND served prepared food made me excited to stop by. We went there to order lunch to go and the staff was very rude, it felt as if we were bothering them by being there. I ordered the stewed chicken and my boyfriend ordered the oxtail. The oxtail was good, however the stewed chicken was terrible, too much  cloves in the stewed chicken for my taste. Before we even ordered, the rude girl behind the counter informed us that they were out of plantains. No big deal, I'm just wondering how you're out of plantains when you have a grocery store inside of your business. We've found better Jamaican food restaurants in Charlotte and will not be back to Island Grocery."}
{"text":"The best dish I have had to date from Island Grocery is.... Well I can't say. Everything is fresh and delicious. I have had their Stew chicken, Jerk Chicken and Oxtails and each time I get the steamed veggies with rice and peas. The place is small but clean. The ladies are always friendly and have a smile."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Don't buy groceries here because you'll be stuck with stale and dry products that they refuse to exchange (not even asking for a refund).  They don't even have a non-return policy posted but yet blame the customer for having \"unrealistic expectations\" of their products. Not worth it. Never again."}
{"text":"Delicious Rotis! It's like taking a trip back home, this is the only place in Charlotte that I can get pretty much everything that we have/use in the Caribbean. Love this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been wanting to bring me here for a while so I was very excited to give this place a try.  The grocery part of the store has a great selection of Caribbean food, seasonings and drinks. But the most exciting part to this store is the restaurant. Which offers a huge variety of Caribbean food that they prepare fresh daily. They have everything here from jerk chicken and oxtails to chicken and beef patties.   I let my boyfriend chose our meal and as previous reviews have mentioned the portion sizes here are huge! So you are safe to order something and share it with a friend or two! We we shared an order of stew chicken, rice and peas, veggies and of course a chicken and beef patty.  The stew chicken was soooo tender and full of flavor! Mixed with the rice and peas and veggies it was absolutely delicious!!! And those patties were outstanding! I only tried the chicken but it was huge and so packed with filling and flavor, all I can really say is Yum...Yum!!! Highly recommended!  I definitely recommend this place but just make sure you are hungry when you go!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some Caribbean food and it's also a store so if you need to pick up some island products that u can't find at other stores u can probably find them here also."}
{"text":"Nice caribbean grocer on the east side, I found some great curry powders and other items for a recipe.  I also tried the food since it was around lunch-I tried the curry chicken with cabbage and rice ...it was just ok so I'll stick to buying their curry powder for now."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. Very crowded due to size and it took a minute to the get the food because the lady at the counter was dealing with a customer on the phone. When you go to Caribbean spots, you don't expect speedy service so that's a given. Decided to order two patties and the mac and cheese. The patties were decent and the mac and cheese didn't have much seasoning. I've never tried the jerk chicken, roti, or oxtail so I can't give an honest answer on that."}
{"text":"They have a Caribbean grocery store with a peculiar selection of herbal remedies. That is not what I went there for. The main attraction is their restaurant. A friend recommended the jerk chicken, and he warned me that I wouldn't be able to finish my plate in one sitting. Challenge accepted, I set out on my own personal Man vs Food bout. Long story short, the food won by a knockout. Best guess is that in a large plate they serve about 1.5 lbs of food and for under $10! But this isn't food you could easily replicate at home, their jerk chicken is perfectly seasoned. Enough heat to make you sweat, but not so much that it numbs you. The sides are all solid too, and so are their beef patties. If you're in the area, treat yourself and get a Ting soda, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm in here at least 3 times a week now because I can buy lunch, dinner, tea, cold drinks, vitamins, soap, spices, snacks, desserts, etc. Plus the staff is so nice. I visit chain grocers alot less often"}
{"text":"Island Grocery and Carribean Restaurant is small in size but very well stocked with all the Carribbean Food Provisions most people would need, and it is a great place to get a cooked meal as well.  I ordered a small oxtail plate with rice n peas and cabbage and 2 codfish fritters to go and was very satisfied with my meal.  It was hot , fresh and authentically prepared.  Their prices on hot meals are subject to change without notice, depending on what they have in stock, so ask before you order.  But the food is great.  I will definitely go back and try their other dishes. And for all my carribean product needs."}
{"text":"The best goat roti in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place, bc I love Jamaican food and finally found a place near my place.   It's in the middle of a strip mall by the interception of albermale and central ave. they have a lil grocery inside and good price lunch special.   However, I was not impressed by the food at all.the chicken is super dried!!!!! I was the first customer, bc I called in my food at 9:45am, and they open at 10am. Somehow i feel like they have served chicken from the day before. I mean the jerk chicken flavor is good but the texture is just not good! The filling in the patties are groovy, and there's no meat taste at all.   I do want to go back and give it another try before I give up on this place"}
{"text":"I've been to every single Caribbean restaurant in Charlotte and this is by far the best one yet!  Authentic taste and great service. Not to mention they have a little grocery store with all of the West Indian necessities. Most of the Caribbean restaurants I've been to in Charlotte taste like frozen or canned food with no seasoning or flavor- no no not Island Grocery. The ladies behind the counter are friendly and don't frown their faces when ordering (like a lot of Caribbean restaurants). Oh, their homemade desserts are freaking delish! Especially their carrot cake and rum pound cake. They even have frozen patties for you to take home (veggie, spinach, beef and chicken). It's a bonus that they have vegetarian options!!! Love this place. Will definitely be back- they remind me so much of the the authentic Caribbean restaurants up north!  I can't wait to try the roti and sorrel. Next paycheck I guess!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Jamaican food in Charlotte. Been coming here for a couple years now and the food is amazing. I always get the jerk chicken with a side of rice and beans, mac and cheese, and fried plantains. You could sit inside and enjoy your food but the grocery is pretty small so i wouldnt recommend it. The people who work there do have a bit of an attitude but i dont mind it when the food is this good. I recommended this place to everyone i know!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny. Had the beef patty. Oh my GAWD. Legit beef patties! And the jerk chicken is awesomeeeee. Almost Looks like they took a whole chicken cut up there is so much meat. They don't skimp for sure, and I got a small. Can't wait to try the oxtails next time. So happy!"}
{"text":"Good Caribbean food.  Two items I felt calories worthy. Coco bread, very good sweet bread. And Escovich fish, I had red snapper. King fish was the other option. Fried whole fish with a spicy pickled vegetable  (chow chow). Get three sides. I love greens, so it's what I got. It's okay, too much stalk and not enough leaf. Best green is still at Soul Central.  Curried Goat roti: good but just slightly missed flavoring. Goat soft and not gamy flavor. Roti is very thin flour tortilla with mashed mung bean in between. Good, just need touch of salt.   Jerked chicken patti okay in flavor but nice flaky crust.   Sweat potato pudding dessert very dense and bland flavor. Would not recommend. They have other desserts like rum cake. Will have to try next time.   Overall would recommend and come back."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place! I am Jamaican and appreciate finding a place like this. They have great food. I had the brown stew chicken and my husband had the jerk chicken. Yum yum!  All the grocery items I need are also here. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am from Guyana and I am glad this place exists. I am able to buy what I need without having to wait for someone to travel back home and THEN bring the items back.  I have had some of the food there before and I thought it was pretty good.  I will going there to pick up some Casareep and some  Pholourie Mix."}
{"text":"Great little place! Went there strictly to eat. Ordered the jerk chicken with fried plantains and white rice and a ginger beer. Delicious! Got a small portion and definitely thought they had made a mistake and given me a large. This is a great little spot for lunch. Not a lot of room though."}
{"text":"My family is from Trinidad so I LOVE trini food especially Roti, doubles, palorie etc. I recently moved from NY to Charlotte and NY has the BEST food hands down from all cultures. It took me a while to find a place with good authentic Roti but I can finally say I found the best Roti in Charlotte at Island Grocery. I was so shocked when I took a bite because it taste exactly like the roti I would buy in Brooklyn and Bronx NY. If you are trini and you need a good roti shop I am telling you to come here for sure. I wish they had beef roti as well but other than that I am a new customer  My Mom no longer has to bring me Roti from NY when she comes to visit."}
{"text":"Had lunch special. Jerk chicken with 2 sides fur only 5.50 and includes a can soda. Chicken was good but not as spicy as I would have liked. Store also has many authentic Caribbean food and spices. I would go back again."}
{"text":"When I moved to Charlotte I was craving some patties and this place has the best ones I've tasted here (so far). The curry goat is very good, too and I LOVE that I can buy my packs of  sorrel here. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fresh carrot juice Home cooked, authentic jerked spices! This place is great.... it has all of your authentic Jamaican foods-THANK GOODNESS. Convenient location, but look for the oil station for the U turn into the shopping center or you could miss it."}
