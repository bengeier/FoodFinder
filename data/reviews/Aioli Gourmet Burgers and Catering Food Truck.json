{"text":"We tried this truck at the DC Ranch Community Center Food Truck Night. We were really excited to try it based on previous reviews.   Then we got there.   The wait was over 45 minutes and what we received was far from what I'd call good. The burger tasted like it had been pre-made, It was thick and dry. It definitely was not cooked there. Or maybe it was and the meat was super poor quality. I've had better at Five Guys I'm ashamed to admit, and the Aioli was bland and tasted like nothing.   We tried 3 different burgers and while the toppings on the Pancetta burger were at least somewhat good, the burger itself was a grave disappointment. The trucks service was painfully slow and they were out of a lot of things despite us arriving relatively early. I love supporting local businesses especially food trucks but this one left us all underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I was at a Phoenix Fire Department event and tried the burger dinner...I bought 6 dinners of various selection for my family and everyone was very pleased with their meal! There was a line, but moved VERY quickly and efficiently!! The food was absolutely delicious, and would recommend any burger lover to try it!! Even the fries were good!! My 5 year old grandson ate his whole burger(and bun) he left a few fries (he is a good eater). Later that night we ask him if he wanted a treat before bed and he said no I'm full of burger!  The following day I realized I misplaced my credit card. I reached out to Kyle and received an immediate response they had not located any lost card. He even checked with additional staff and gave me a follow up email ... I later realized I put it in my coat pocket.   I was so excited to dig into my juicy hot black and blue burger which was absolutely delicious I misplaced my credit card.  I am always glad to find a conscientious business...the service didn't stop because the meal was over--they seemed truly happy to help me verify I did not leave my card! I will definitely eat with them again!! Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!! We hired the truck for a baby shower with a group of 60. Everyone raved about the burgers and fries. My veggie friends said best veggie burgers ever. Not one complaint from any one and endless compliments.  And.. at the end of the shower, I had no clean up! I highly recommend Aioli Gourmet Burgers to anyone that is thinking about catering an event. The burgers were truly delicious and and the crew a delight to work with."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!!! This has to be one of the best burger I have ever at. So much flavor. So juicy, the sauce choice is great and simply delicious!!! hands down this place is a must go!!! Great Work Keep it up! I ordered at Aspire at Pinnacle Peak."}
{"text":"Tried Aioli's for the first time tonight in downtown Gilbert. I am so glad we decided on this food truck over all the others! I'm not a burger person at all but the Aioli Burger was amazing!! I would definitely order this again."}
{"text":"I've had just about everything on the menu and I gotta say this truck is awesome!! They started coming to my apartment community Aspire Pinnacle Peak and I LOVE IT! Keep it up Aioli Burgers."}
{"text":"Yesterday this company came to my place of employment for lunch. Great food for sure.   Both Aioli and Modern Tortilla had a surprise visit and inspection. You guys still remained calm and cool and threw down on that food."}
{"text":"Our office hired this food truck for lunch today ! Hands down one of the best burgers I've tried ! Had the white truffle !"}
{"text":"This is soo awesome! I knew they had a truck out in the tempe/Scottsdale area but now they have one covering phoenix too! Delicious burgers and great fries too! If you want some good grub this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Tremendous. Stunningly great street eats. These burgers are perfectly cooked, the toppings perfectly accent the meat, and the juices and flavors combine into an amalgamation of goodness in every bite.  The California Burger is king. The egg and avocado make the dish. Use the fries to sop up the extra. So frigging good I could eat it twice a day. I'd have a heart attack in a week but...yeah.   The Italian one is amazing too. Honorable mention must be made. All said, these guys are delivering better-than gourmet burgers that make for a meal well worth chasing across the valley."}
{"text":"A fantastic burger!  They showed up at our office today, hope they come back soon!!!    Burger: A Cooked just right, juicy and delicious Bun: A+ The best buns since Richard Simmons  Toppings: A Perfect ratio of musrooms, cheese, onions, and mayo Fries: A+ Really great fries to complement this tasty motherfworder Price: B $8.69 for a burger, &10.69 for a burger + fries.  Not cheap, but convenient and delicious.    They were out of sweet potato fries, but the regular ones are great.  I had the Mushroom & Swiss burger.  I would recommend this to anyone who is there when the truck shows up.  If they are driving by, I would recommend trying to grab onto the truck as it goes by, hold on for the ride"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!!! This has to be one of the best burger I have ever at. So much flavor,So juicy,, the sauce choice is great and are simply delicious!!! hands down this place is a must go!!! GREAT WORK KEEP IT UP! i ordered at Aspire at Pinnacle Peak."}
{"text":"Tom and his team does a phenomenal job in creating the most delicious burgers.... Had an awesome dinner experience last night. Tom was gracious enough to wait the extra 15 mins before closing so we could get our meal. Thank you!!! Your kind heartedness touched us last night and will touch many more... God bless you and keepdoing the rok, you will see success big time!!"}
{"text":"Its surprising that food this good could come out of a truck. The Aioli Burger was so delicious that adding any conventional condiments could only take away from the taste. The flavors in the burger were perfectly balanced. The white truffle fries are the best fries I've had ever since I've moved to Phoenix about 10 years ago. Surprisingly they stayed crispy even after I realized I was spending too much time snapping photos of it. The caprese salad also looked surprisingly fancy coming out of the side of a truck. Unfortunately I am unable to comment on its taste since it wasn't mine."}
{"text":"The veggie burger was fantastic!!!! Way to cater to the veggie crowd. Loved the food."}
{"text":"Aioli Burger- Not that great...  I've had better burgers off job site food trucks or at a county fair.  Fries were flat and without substance, burger was underdone and tasteless. If you want a patty from Costco that's underdone with some fru fru schmutz on it, give it a try. Carl's Junior is better... I don't get how people are 5 staring this..."}
{"text":"So, I had always been a white truffle swiss burger guy myself, but I asked the folks at Aioli Burger to surprise me with anything but the falafel Burger. They gave me the \"Aioli Burger\" and it was awesome, only problem is now I don't have a favorite burger I have two. These burgers are out of this world."}
{"text":"That was one hell of a BURGER!! I randomly came across that truck one day and ordered a burger and some fries.. after talking to Chef Tom, I found out he was part owner. I let him make me a custom burger and pick my fry sauce (no more boring Catsup). He went with their classic Black and Blue (which was amazing!) and chipotle aioli fry sauce (which also was amazing!).  Overall great food and a great experience meeting a local business owner and entrepreneur. Thank you Chef Tom and Team!"}
{"text":"Burger was over cooked, sloppy dress up. I also waited 20 mins with two other customers.  I should of went to \"Whataburger\"."}
{"text":"The food truck was at our work location this week and I thought it would be worth a try based on all the positive reviews....and all the menu options sounded really good! I ordered the black and blue burger in a lattice wrap. The toppings were good but that was about it. I really did not like my burger, it was sooo dry that without a sip of water I felt like I was about to choke. I can't even imagine how dry it would have tasted on an actual bun.   I wanted to like this food truck, but it fell short. They were out of a few things by the time I ordered too, so that was a bit disappointing. I ordered my food around noon. On a positive not, the staff seemed really nice though."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaazing!  I went to their food truck for the first time today, and the workers are so funny and personable!  I had better service today, than I've had anywhere for a very long time!  I enjoyed the white truffle burger today, and it is sinfully delicious!  Mmmmmmmnnnnn!!!!!  I would have taken a picture, but I devoured my food before I even thought of it!"}
{"text":"Eating the White Truffle Swiss burger in front of someone should be banned as a form of torture as per the Geneva convention.  It's THAT good.  I've also tried the California burger, and it impressed me as well.  It wasn't as much of a hit as the White Truffle Swiss burger for me, but that comes down to personal taste, some of my coworkers preferred the California.  The burgers are so filling you COULD skip the fries, but they're the perfect accompaniment to the burgers so that would be a mistake.  They offer a variety of aiolis for dipping and a house-made ketchup!  I'm working my way through their menu as quickly as possible, their calendar makes it easy to track them down.  But I'm crossing my fingers that they make my office near University and Elwood a regular stop!  ;)"}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time today and word's cannot describe the joy this food gave me! Burger was cooked to a perfect medium. The thought of applewood bacon onion jam scared me a little but as soon as I took my first bite all of my fears went away. I highly recommend the chipotle aioli dip with the fries. Fat Kid Tip: Make sure to save some of that aioli to dip in your burger as the two compliment each other very well."}
{"text":"This food truck came to my work and I'm hoping they return! Loved that they had a vegetarian option at a burger food truck! I had the falafel burger with a lettuce wrap instead of the bun and it was amazing! I absolutely loved it! The sauce they used was fantastic plus the fries were yummy! If they return I will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Best burger of my life! Seriously. I had the Black & Blue and it was simply delicious! Brioche bun, blue cheese, caramelized onions... So good! I can't wait till I eat their food again. I guess I'm gonna have to track them down since they're a food truck..."}
{"text":"I first tried Aioli Burger at First Friday last month. The line felt like it took forever, probably only 10 minutes, but that tells me something, that the food must be worth it. I got the White Truffle Burger, HOLY MOLY IT WAS AMAZING!!! I am obsessed with Truffles and I love mushrooms and swiss, so this burger was perfect for me. I highly recommend it! I will be returning to Aioli Burger this month for first Friday again! I also hope to check out the pop up restaurant on Mill Ave! Thanks for making such amazing burgers guys!"}
{"text":"This food truck is fantastic!! Every thing I tried was excellent!! Service was great! I'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"What a fantastic idea!  A food truck serving gourmet burgers was the highlight of the birthday party.  The presentation was fun, but the delicious burgers and fries were a huge hit.  Will definitely recommend your catering for fun parties."}
{"text":"I had heard of this truck but never tried it. Another truck was parked near and I was heading that way, but my wife convinced me to trust her and try this one. She ordered the white truffle burger, knowing my tastes.   She's a smart woman. It was an excellent burger. The only thing was the bun could've been a little warmer. Seriously - the only downside was the bun not warm enough? It's a great burger!"}
{"text":"Tried this at the Scottsdale Food Truck roundup last night, and ordered the Aioli burger.  The first thing they said to me is if I wanted to change the cheese to something else, which confused me.  If this is your signature burger, why admit that you should change something about it?  The burger was okay, even though I picked it up right away it seemed like the patty wasn't hot.  I wonder if they actually make the burger or buy it premade.  It was pretty bland.  I also ordered the fries, and asked to get the \"House Made Ketchup\" as per a menu option.  When it was time to pick up, the prep guy pointed down to a table outside the truck and told me the ketchup was there.  It was packets of Heinz.  Really?  I will pass on this truck in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great atmosphere. They cater to kids appetites and adult pickiness. Serve yourself sodas and amazing fries!!"}
{"text":"Black and blue burger was excellent! Most food trucks are overpriced, but this is certainly worth it. Fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Wow....... best burger I have ever had! The aioli sauce is delicious and their grilled vegetables are the perfect side! You have to try this place as every burger on their menu is to die for!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. I checked out this little truck at the Saturday night gathering of trucks in Scottsdale. I order a truffle burger it was cooked perfectly and was rich and full of flavor. The perfect burger to go with a cold beer. Kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"As a general rule I avoid food trucks. I prefer healthier fare. We had a luncheon cancelled at work and I was left without a lunch. I was getting in my car when I saw the food truck across the parking lot and decided to give it a try.  I ordered the the Italian burger and it was the BEST burger I have ever had. I hope our employer brings this truck back soon."}
{"text":"Aioli Burger always brings their best when they come to the Weebly office in Scottsdale! Friendly, good food, good vibes. Their unique menu items they create for us are always on point, too!   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Super WOW,  I have now been back to Aioli Gourmet Burgers, like 6 times and every time it gets better.  I think I can cook and most will agree, and I really don't like to go out but I can come here any time and it tastes and feels like the BOMB home cooking off the grill everything has that great BBQ cooked feel and tasted, everything every time has just been over the top.  And you have a great staff too, the last few times we have been helped by Hailee and she seems to be having fun and it rubs off and makes coming out to eat a little better.    Luv u guys keep it up,"}
{"text":"After a long wait an Aioli truck came to Gilbert  and we were able to catch it. We ordered the California, Italiano and truffle burger with fries side. The burger itself wasn't good at all, it was missing everything and it was overcooked as well, but the sauce was one of the best I have for a while but unfortunately it wasn't enough to cover that tasteless piece of meat. Lastly the fries which was cooked with a really old burned oil.  So overall a two star will be good, since the sauce deserve a 5 star, 1 star for the meat and 1 star for the fries."}
{"text":"Burgers are sensational.  It's nice to have something different other than plain cheddar and bacon burger.  I've tried the white truffle and the bleu and bacon.  Both tasty, but the white truffle burger is way better.  Give it a try.  Guy behind the glass is super friendly too."}
{"text":"The Burgers were cooked fresh. I got the Fresh Prince burger which was a special and I wanted to order another but I was so stuffed! Will come back in the future!!! The atmosphere almost has a 1950s burger shop feel! If you're daring try the Triple Threat Challenge!!!"}
{"text":"Only two stars becuase they ran out some burgers. He only had the aioli buger. =(  I wish i can join in on all of the awesome reviews. They came to my job for \"Food truck thursdays!!\"  So I ordered fries and garlic basil aioli. It was just an order of fries nothing to go crazy about but man I wanted the burger so bad!! Hopefully I encounter the truck again to take advantage of those specials!"}
{"text":"Truly a hot spot in hiding! I've seen their food truck around the city, but finally went in for some burger grub. I ordered the green chili burger, with sweet potato fries and lemonade on the side. DELICIOUS! Juicy and flavorful patty, the aioli paired great with all the flavors. And the lemonade emphasizes how comfortable the atmosphere is. Oh! And the owner is so friendly and attentive! Great service, great meal!"}
{"text":"Best food truck around! If I was able to rate two thumb up in addition to 5 stars, I would.    I tried the California Burger, very tasty; avocado, pickled red onions, pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli and a sunny side egg to top it all off... If that's not a flavor blast in your mouth I don't know what is.   I invite anyone, whether you have a sophisticated pallet or not, to indulge in the deliciousness that is Aioli Gourmet Burgers.  Great food,  great staff what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Aioli catered our wedding in January and they did a fantastic job. We had tried the truck a few times at various food events and when it came time to choose a truck we went with Aioli. I will admit though, that they were not our first choice, we had an absurdly difficult time trying to book a few other trucks but after haphazard communications and insanely high prices that didn't justify what they were offering we turned to Aioli and they came through.  We are not a high maintenance couple and they were overly helpful at every turn, from suggesting menu items to organizing day-of preparations everything was smooth. They were even kind enough to accommodate me changing the time of the event a week before the date!   Another thing that impressed me was their punctuality and meticulous planning, we got married at a residence and they planned to arrive within minutes of the ceremony concluding, I didn't even think to ask about this but I'm glad they did.   If you're considering Aioli for your wedding I can confidently tell you that I plan to use them for my next 3 weddings..."}
{"text":"This was a really good experience.  Let me start with the negative. The truck was out of sides except fries, and only had one salad choice left. Okay, now let me tell you how this is my fault.  The little kitchen on wheels was only scheduled to be at this location for 3 hours and we got there later in those 3 hours.  Oh, and I wasn't planning on salad anyway. Now let me tell you about the food. My wife got the Aoli burger, son the White Truffle and I got the Black and Blue, and we all got fries. We all murmured good things as we bit into our burgers, as the meat was crusted with goodness and still juicy inside. The fries were really good too.  I normally prefer crispy fries, and most of these were crispy indeed, however these fries had a different vibe, to where both the crisp ones were fantastic, and the softer ones were...fantastic. The burger I had was really good with bacon and bleu cheese. The flavors worked well together and the bleu didn't overpower the sauce or meat.  I'm now trying to think of an event to put on so I can have them over to cater.  The guys running the show were polite and friendly as well. Aoli Gourmet is a hit with my family."}
{"text":"Living in N. Phoenix, I'm not privy to the fascinating world of food trucks so I had never heard of Aioli Burger before last night. After looking them up, they seem to be pretty well known in the valley thanks to appearances on all local news programs and winning a best burger award earlier this year. I decided to go with the falafel burger, but next time will definitely order a regular burger. The falafel wasn't as crispy on the outside as I prefer and the pickled onions and mango sauce just didn't seem to work flavor wise with the falafel. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad burger by any means it just wasn't what I had expected. I'd definitely give this truck a second chance given the opportunity. The fries were delicious, and I like that they offer their burgers on a brioche bun OR wrapped in lettuce. I like options :)"}
{"text":"Sorry guys  but my first experience was not good. I used Uber eats to order from you guys. I ordered the Aioli Burger Medium Well. I'd say it was more Rare/medium or rare. Even at that it wasn't cooked enough. Since I had ordered from Uber eats I could not send it back to get it cooked a little longer. And another thing that I was looking forward to was your house made ketchup, I was given 5 packs of Heinz. Don't get me wrong that's a good brand but it's no house made. Overall I'd say it has potential but get your orders right."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to make the trek over to Scottsdale JUST to give these guys a try, but as luck would have it, they were parked right outside my building downtown this past Tuesday, so I had to take advantage.   CON:  Standing in a super long line in at lunchtime on the surface of the sun *cough* I mean, in downtown Phoenix during the summer *cough*  That, in and of itself, could be enough to make me grumpy and perhaps a little critical of their supposed deliciousness (I've read the reviews, folks. I had high expectations).   However, there was no grumpiness. The guys were hustling. The line moved at a reasonable rate. Somehow, I made up my mind (too many delicious things to choose from).   And then, the moment of truth...  At the end of the day, it's a burger and fries. But, HOLE-EEE COW, that is the juiciest and most flavorful burger I think I have ever had. SOOOOO GOOOOODD!!!   The fries were crisp and warm -- just like I like 'em. My only regrets -- not trying more than one aioli to dip them in (totally delish!) AND passing on the mango lemonade. (Don't make my mistake, folks. Just order the lemonade. Trust me. Your friends don't want you drinking theirs. Order your own.)  I will definitely be back. And will bring friends. And tell everyone along the way that they need to come too."}
{"text":"I follow these trucks everywhere they go.... I'm so excited to see that they expanded to two trucks!!! Friends have used them for catering small to big events with full menu choices too. I was also lucky enough to be at The Burger Battle of 2015 when they won out of all those other restaurants and it was 1st time they had a truck enter!!! Way to go Aioli......"}
{"text":"Burgers are the Bomb here and WAY tastier than the burgers at Burger Rehab, Desoto Market downtown and The Vig!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was blown away by the burgers! If you are lucky enough to run across the Aioli Gourmet food truck, try a burger whether or not you are hungry. You will not be disappointed! Their food truck schedule can also be found on their website: https://www.aioliburger.com/calendar/ Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. For $10 the burger was pretty cold and had onions on it that I asked for to be removed. Being that I was at work with a 35 minute lunch I didn't have the time to tell them this. It would have been better for me to go to In n Out Burger. Sorry but I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"holy shit best idea for a food truck. I had the white truffle swiss burger and was in actual heaven. can't wait to come back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Awesome food truck I highly recommend for graduation parties I hired them for my wedding on New Year's Eve and my gas still talk about the hamburgers!"}
{"text":"just ate their food outside of Zapcon 2016 and it was delicious! extremely happy that they had a legitimate vegetarian option to eat! if they were parked anywhere else I was at I would definitely eat their food again."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!! Cannot wait to see what they cook up in their restaurant space opening soon! Love the fact they partner with UberEats. And they package to go orders so effectively with everything separate so your burger isn't sloppy or soggy. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"They catered our work party and it I got a white truffle burger that was SO good.  Their fries were super tasty as well, some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"They were catering for a prom event for a business that I attended to. When I heard there was going to be a food truck that was catering to the event, I was a little hesitant. Once I walked in the venue and saw everyone with their burgers, I was really eager to try the food. I ordered the White Truffle Swiss burger with the lettuce wrap (I can't have the bun because I have celiac disease and can't have the gluten). My goodness it was such a delicious burger! I'm not a big burger person but I will definitely go back and have more. It was cooked to a perfect medium and the fries were so delicious! Normally when I have a burger in a lettuce wrap, everything slides around and it's a disgusting mess. But not with these guys. They wrapped the lettuce with the burger in such a way that I was able to enjoy my burger without making a mess. Great food and will highly recommend anyone to check them out. Amazing food."}
{"text":"Okay these burgers are life changing! I know it sounds dramatic but I'm serious. The homemade Aiolis are incredible!!! I like to order extra to dip my fries in them. The burgers are full of flavor! The meat is great quality. I'm kind of a burger snob and this is my favorite place to grab lunch. Also, Chef Tom and his staff are super friendly. I hired Chef Tom to cater my bridal shower and it was a hit! I will be hiring them again to cater my next big event. I'm so excited they are opening a restaurant on 32nd and Shea!! No wonder they won the Arizona Burger Battle. These guys know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"OMFG!!!!! I just had the best veggie burger of my life! You must try the falafel burger with arugula! I can't even tell you how amazing this masterpiece is! Thank you Chef, for creating this amazing, mouth watering, joyful experience!"}
{"text":"These guys are amazing!  We hired them to cater our wedding a month ago, and our wedding guests are still talking about the food!  We absolutely love their burgers and when we found out they also do catering we could not pass up the chance for all our family and friends to try their food too. They served chicken pacata, lasagna, bruschetta, and caprese kabobs, and everything was delicious! Our only regret was we wish our wedding guests would've left us alone so we could eat ALL our food! These guys need to open a restaurant, Chef Tom nails everything he cooks! If you haven't tried Aioli yet, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Was rather disappointed in the burger I got today.  The burger itself was pretty dry.  The cheese and bacon were cold... Pretty sad that I spent $10 while 'cheating' on my diet for a cold tasteless burger. The staff was friendly, and the fries were GREAT... I am hoping it was just an off day for them.."}
{"text":"This food truck was at my apartment complex last night. Normally I don't eat red meat so I didn't plan on going here but the leasing office gave me a $5 voucher. I handed it over to my boyfriend because he loves burgers! He ordered the aioli burger and regular fries (they were out of sweet potato fries). I took a few bites of his burger and really liked it! I thought the fries were GREAT though! I never order fries at restaurants because the taste of oil from deep frying them is always too strong. I couldn't taste grease AT ALL on these. At first I assumed they used really clean oil but they may have been baked? However they were cooked, they were really good! I am really curious how they are cooked though..."}
{"text":"My (now) husband and I booked these guys for our rehearsal dinner! We were having a lot of people fly in from all over the country and wanted to invite them into our lives in a way. We love going to the local food truck in Phoenix, and this is honestly one of the best. We worked with Kyle and Chef tom to create a custom Taco Menu (yes, tacos from a burger truck!). I honestly expected just to have like pre-made meat and all the fixins just out on a table for everyone to get, but they cooked everything to order and had a gourmet toppings bar, tiered with things like pickled onions, jalapenos, guac, multiple kinds of salsas, Mexican egg rolls, etc. We wanted to make it southwestern and he nailed it. It really made our wedding weekend that much better!!!"}
{"text":"A quality burger is all about the meat.  At first glance, Aioli Burger seems to be focused on creating unique burger experiences with clever condiments and other interesting toppings. The menu is fantastically diverse and thematic for a burger joint, but don't let that put you off. Aioli is the real deal.  I have one or two other favorite burgers in town, but this is in the top five.  I've been in several times and have tried three or four of the choices, but I keep going back to the mainstay: the Aioli Burger itself.  The meat is fresh.  The cooking temperature is perfect. The seasonings are a compliment, not a distraction.  My motto is always, \"food first\" when I dine, but Aioli's service has been second to only a few.  We've made large orders for pickup.  I've eaten at the shop. Each time, service has been nearly perfect.    Stop in. Find the truck. Do what you have to do to get an Aioli Burger.  Now."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. Great friendly service. We don't buy burgers anywhere else. So good!!"}
{"text":"Aoli burger did my wedding in my backyard as a late night \"snack\" for guests The food was excellent. People couldn't stop talking about it--even to this day! I've tried a couple different burgers ---they were both SO good. It's hard to choose from their list. My guests had all fabulous things to say, and the crew working the truck were just as awesome. Very Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices, nice atmosphere. Unique burgers and the service is always good. We hit this place up regularly. Mac-n-Cheese bites are addictive."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. The young man helping us was polite and awesome, a future Wildcat!   The food was ok. Was not bad, and was not amazing. It was a good burger. Did not see anything special or amazing for what you pay. The fries were pretty darn tasty.   Would pass if I had other options to try, but would try out if it is your first time."}
{"text":"My first interaction with Aioli Burger was at the Sail Inn on Mill. I enjoyed the food soo much I decided it would be the perfect addition to my my fathers 50th birthday party. We were planning a Casino night and originally just doing a BBQ, glad I changed my mind and had Aioli Burger take care of the work so I could enjoy the night!  They are mainly known for their burgers but they also worked with me to create a custom menu offering several types of sandwiches, sides, and of course their world famous burgers! Kyle and the Chef Tommy were easy to work with and really made sure I had no worries! Will definitely be using them again!"}
{"text":"YAY UPDATE!! Second chances for the win!!! I'm so glad to be updating this review for two reasons. 1. The amazing customer service and acknowledgment I received after writing my first bad review and 2. Because the food was well deserved a 5 star rating.  I am still being health conscious so today I went with their caprese salad but they did have a much better menu and options this time around which I was happy about. I'm hoping they bring the Italian burger on the menu next time they come to USAA! Been dying to try it!   The caprese salad was amazing!!! Seems so simple but it had such great flavor. The greens and tomato were so fresh and crisp and the mozzarella was to die for. Not sure if they home make it or it was just a really good fresh mozzarella cause it was rich, creamy and just crumbled with each bite. The basalmic reduction was super tasty too. They give you a good amount so it was perfect for my lunch and I was fully satisfied.   I thank the amazing owners of this truck for being so kind and addressing my concerns. I talked back and forth with the owner Tom and he was nothing but nice and open ears. Looking forward to trying a burger on my next cheat meal. Thank you (:"}
{"text":"They catered an event we attended and blew us away with amazing food. Amazing truffle and swiss burger with fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Delish!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Starting with the friendly staff that invited us with a welcoming smile. They helped answer all of our questions and their suggestions did not let us down. WOW....the burgers were juicy, flavorful, and more than we had hoped for. The bread was crispy and soft....with a generous portion of toppings on the perfectly cooked meat and we did not want to put the burgers down. The fries also hit the spot and we loved the variety of dips. PERFECT meal....and we will definitely be going back! Great team-Great service-Great food-and we are excited for more!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner Sunday evening at the Tasting Room on Wilson where their food truck was set up.  After hearing great things about their food and seeing the delicious looking photos, we decided to give it a try!   The prices are very affordable here, which honestly surprised me.  I ordered the Aioli Burger with fries and my boyfriend ordered the White Truffle Burger.  After we each took the first bite (while still chewing) the first thing we both said was \"oh my god, this is so good.\" These burgers were as mouth watering as their photos.  Incredibly juicy and tender with obviously fresh ingredients.  My salted fries came served with both a home made ketchup and a garlic dipping sauce; I wanted to just drink them by themselves, that's how good they are!  Every aspect of our meal was amazing and we are so glad that we found this gem.  I keep track of their calendar to see when they will be around our neck of the woods so I can grab another Aioli Burger (see ya 4/17!!).  Wish I could have one right this second! I highly recommend this food truck; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is Aiolis Second truck and its just as great as the first. Their menu is the same but they are starting to do a monthly burger. This months the Arizona its spicy but its good. The fries were awesome they had a chipotle aioli to go with it as well as a housenade ketchup."}
{"text":"We used the Aioli Gourmet Burgers food truck to cater our wedding and I can honestly say that it was a smash hit! The food was excellent, the service was great and the team was very personable. Some of our guests even liked it so much that they went to their bricks and mortar location the day after our wedding before they left town. I have nothing but enormous praise for these guys and can't thank them enough for helping to make our day so special. I highly recommend them for any of your catering needs or just a good burger out with friends and family."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Taste like a backyard burger.  Everything made to order and the have gf buns.  Also I love a good Aioli mmmm yum !"}
{"text":"Food on wheels gets me every time. I love the idea of being able to occasionally try out a new place without having to drive to the other side of town to get it. The Aioli Food Truck is no exception. They occasionally drove out to the side of town I used to work in and it was a great treat to be able to hit them up for a work lunch.  I'm a fan of the white truffle & swiss burger. It has a great savory taste and is just the right amount of food for a lunch. The fries are crisp and tasty.  Staff is always friendly and moves through orders quickly to keep people on time for a lunch. Be sure to check their online schedule for where they will be and when.  Overall: A Great lunch offerings. Give the Truffle & Swiss a try!"}
{"text":"Their food truck was at our company picnic. Although the wait for a burger was very long due to the crowd of people it was a DELICIOUS burger!!! Fries were perfect too"}
{"text":"There have been some great burger places opening in the Phoenix area as of late.  I would say my top 2 favorites are Aioli Burgers and Ingos tasty burgers.  Both are special in their own way.  This food truck recently took over the spot at Urban cookies that has been occupied by short leash for years.  I am a big fan of short leash and the transition to this food truck has been great.  I always get the white truffle burger because who doesn't love that flavor!  It was fantastic and went well with the ice cold mexican coke.  I will make it a habit to visit them every Tuesday at Urban Cookies.  The tradition of great food trucks continues!"}
{"text":"The burgers are great with several intriguing options. Good neighborhood but the center it is in has gotten a little crowded. I've enjoyed the food but the prices are slightly higher than some of its competition, similar to the prices of the food on the truck, but with a physical location so seems like it could come down slightly. Overall great food with great options."}
{"text":"Tried Aioli Burger for the first time last night and thought it was pretty solid. I ordered the signature burger - the Aioli burger and fries with chipotle aioli for dipping. The woman taking orders was very friendly and made the ordering process very easy. The burger came out in just a few minutes.  The burger is a pretty big, loaded with cheese, aioli (of course) lettuce, tomato and bacon onion jam. The burger was cooked to order (medium) and had a good flavor. The toppings were tasty and a good compliment to the meat. The bun was fresh, which to me can really make or break a burger.   The fries were good, they had a little bit of seasoning on them that for me did not pair well with the chipotle aioli. They were much better with just regular ketchup.  Overall I enjoyed my meal and would go back."}
{"text":"Hooray for Aioli!  I ordered the black & blue burger and it was amazing!  The burger was juicy, despite the fact that I ordered it well done with no garlic aioli (nothing personal, I just don't like aioli).  The fries were perfectly cooked, crispy wonderfulness.  The house made ketchup was a perfect, zingy accompaniment.  I love the little bit of spice at the end.  Come back soon Aioli!  I'll be waiting."}
{"text":"During the Scottsdale Food Truck Caravan, my husband, sister-in-law, and I decided to try Aioli Burgers. Both my husband and I ordered the black and bleu burger - bleu cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, and a pepper aioli sauce. My sister-in-law ordered the mushroom and swiss burger. We also ordered some Golden Fries to split. Honestly, the fries were the best part. Don't get me wrong, the burgers were good - medium rare and juicy. I would order them again if I was at a food truck gathering and craving a burger. However, I wouldn't hunt the truck down just for a burger. Maybe for the fries... I mean, those were good, like really, really good. The truck has some other interesting burgers and a lot of different sauces to try. They even had some freshly prepared lemonade that sounded delicious. Overall, check 'em out and definitely get the Golden Fries."}
{"text":"To Die For! This is what a food truck should be!  Food was delicious and creative and priced very reasonably.  I purchased their signature salad that was enormous for $7, white truffle burger that is delicious and again, $7.  The sauces for the fries are AMAZING!  You can absolutely tell the pride they take in their business.  It was well over 100 degrees inside their truck and yet the chef still wore his impressive chef's coat.  There was no pre-packaged food being served here (like on some food trucks) .  Down to the home made ketsup, these guys are AWESOME!  Thank you for a great lunch....please come back soon!"}
{"text":"I ran across this dream machine while yelping a restaurant my buddy said we should try.  When I seen the Aioli under similar restaurants I checked out their website and saw their calendar had them in my neighborhood today so we patiently awaited the double bonus payday and Aioli Burger truck day.  They had a nice little nook under some covered parking spots in the Choice Hotel parking lot on Mayo in N. Phx/N. Scottsdale.  Since it was our first try, we went straight up Aioli burger, fries, and a coke.  Me and my buddy have eaten our share of burgers, and have had some really good ones.  We both agreed the Aioli Burger, as well as the fries, were incredible.  The texture of the beef was perfectly seasoned and dense like sirloin.  It was cooked to a perfect medium, and adorned with fresh and flavorful condiments.  The hint of garlic and the bacon and onion jam was a symphony of yum.  The fries were crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside and hot but not 300 degrees hot and lightly seasoned.  Washing it down with a MexiCoke was the only way to go.  I will be watching their calendar and seeking them out whenever they are in N. Scottsdale.  If you think you've had the best burger possible and have not tried Aioli, well, you might be mistaken."}
{"text":"I had their aioli burger and aioli fries at Phoenix Comicon. The truck had the longest line and the shortest wait. The food was better quality and cheaper than most sit-down restaurants. The burger was tender and juicy. It also had a very unique taste that wasn't overcomplicated or stacked with veggies you've never heard of. It wasn't messy -- which is important when you're probably sitting on a curb or standing to eat, as is the nature of food trucks. I've been craving aioli burger ever since. I'll have to check their menu again next time, but honestly I'll probably get the same thing; why mess with perfection? If you happen to see this truck serving food in your area, don't hesitate to try it out."}
{"text":"I hired them in May for my daughter's graduation party. The staff was very friendly and professional and the food was fantastic! Burgers were amazing and cooked perfectly. Our guests loved it! I especially loved the convenience. I would definitely do it again!"}
{"text":"These are the BEST burgers in town. Smash burger and all the other burger parlors  need to take lessons from these folks. Great tasting beef and cooked to order- We ordered rare and that is what we received.  Could only eat half so the rest is for lunch today.  Now--- French fries- OMG-right amount of salt,  thin, really crispy . That is why we only ate half our burger. The also have sweet potato fries but we had the regular. Good menu and  a comfy little place.   I noticed liquor license in process.....  Please go and have the Best Burger in Phoenix......"}
{"text":"02/16/2017:  Aioli Burgers food truck came to our apartment complex to help celebrate first day opening of the renovated pool.  (Annual pool renovations occur in January each year.)  As part of the scheduled monthly food trucks that visit the complex, we get a $5 voucher, and Aioli Burger posted its full menu, which consisted of seven burger varieties, two fry varieties (white and sweet potato), and a drink menu. https://www.aioliburger.com/menu/  I don't recall seeing their salad choices and specialty drinks, but I wasn't interested in any of these, so I didn't pay attention.  I wanted to order the Black & Blue burger, but another tenant suggested that I try the Italiano, and when I asked one of the two men manning the food truck which were his favorites on the menu, he only offered the info that the Italiano won two food awards.  I didn't want to take any more time, as there were people falling in line, so I went with the Italiano, with sweet potato fries and asked for extra lettuce on the side, in case I couldn't eat the toasted brioche. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aioli-gourmet-burgers-and-catering-food-truck-scottsdale?select=wc2tO5ichoQfWtR_JN9GUA  (Some bakeries add cornmeal and/or corn syrup in their brioches.).   I should've gone with the Black & Blue... After two bites and feeling a little queasy, I decided to ditch the bread (and some of the balsamic reduction and basil-garlic aioli) and just wrap the tiny patty, tomato, mozzarella, and crispy pancetta with the lettuce given to me.  Much better!  The sweet potato fries stole the show, though.  I thought they were coated with too much salt, so I just brushed some of the salt off before eating them...  Would I try another burger from Aioli Burger?  Only if I could use another $5 voucher!  (For the record, I used the voucher, and paid the $5.40 balance- originally $10.40 with tax- with a $10 bill and let the two guys keep the $4.60 as a tip.)  $15- with tip- is, in my opinion, a bit overpriced for genetically-modified fare that was just OK, even with those delicious and crispy, yet over-salted sweet potato fries.  (If Aioli served organic food, I would say the tab is fair...)  If they come back again, I might give the Black & Blue burger a try!"}
{"text":"First Friday - stood in line for 20 minutes waiting to order the falafel burger (I do not like beef but love the buns and fixins of a burger).  When I finally got to the girl who takes the orders, she informed me that they were all out.  CROSS IT OFF YOUR BOARD IMMEDIATELY when you run out of something!!!!!!! Enough said, worst food truck experience ever!  I was so darn hungry after that and ended up at a fast food chain, now that really sucks!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Italiano burger with sweet potato fries and the cannoli shake....So good! Friendly service great experience all around."}
{"text":"Aioli came to our work again and gave us the same excellent service they always do!  Always consistent great tasting burgers!"}
{"text":"Every burger 5stars!! I used this truck for my wedding reception and their were a few issues with the truck BUT their customer service was beyond imaginable. AND it didn't comprise the quality of eat an every order. I would recommend this business to anyone hungry!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I have ever had. I would highly recommend the California. It is amazing!!!   The staff is also really nice. The owner and chef, Tommy, is very personable and really takes pride in creating a great meal for every customer.   I will definitely be going to Aioli when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"It is not often anymore, that I tuck into a real burger but after a long walk around the Tempe town lake area this Sunday morning, the burger truck was a siren song that I could not resist and, I'm glad I did not resist, what a burger!  The cost is surprisingly affordable at $7 for a fully loaded burger and an additional $3 for some of the best fries I've had in a long time. They had the texture of a Belgian fry so I knew these had been through an initial fry and cooling, and then fried again in the truck - crispy all the way through and you can get them with a number of hand crafted sauces - the one I tried, and liked quite a bit, was the handmade ketchup.  As for the burger, I'm a bun fan and this was a hell of a good locally made bun. As for the meat, they aren't stingy on the patty - hand formed and with enough fat in it to meld all the ingredients together - I had the signature Aioli burger with lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and bacon - I can't eat those often anymore but when I do, I would gladly eat a burger here.   For my more constrained moments, when I want a burger without shooting up my cholesterol levels, they do offer a veggie burger which I look forward to trying - the security at the Sunday farmer's market in Tempe said they generally come every other week.  All in all, probably the best burger I've had in a long time - if you are a burger fan, this is one you need to try - and then you can eat it and people watch the people at the market - a great way to spend the first part of your Sunday! :-)"}
{"text":"After retrying Aioli Gourmet Burgers, I found the burger to be amazing! Their Aioli Burger was juicy and extremely delicious! I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I ended up at Sandpiper Elementary to try the burgers here after looking at their calendar and seeing that's where they'd be on my husband's birthday; turns out it was the school's art fair and that's why the truck was at the school! But that didn't stop us from eating one heck of a delicious burger. We both had the Aioli burger and fries. The burger was absolutely fantastic! The aioli is fresh made, requires refrigeration, and is truly gourmet. The fries were a little salty, but the burger is really why you go to a gourmet burger place, so who cares? The only thing is that it was quite a bit of a wait because it is so small in that little truck and there was only the one guy cooking."}
{"text":"Great food truck! They came to Old town Scottsdale last week and the chef Austin did a great job explaining the menu and what makes aioli burger special. Would definitely recommend aioli burger if you want a unique burger!"}
{"text":"I had the black and blue burger with sweet potato fries. It was all excellent. Just wish my burger would have been cooked more. The chipotle aioli dipping sauce goes great with the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Thanks for catering the Skirt Chaser 5K in Tempe! The burger & fries were delicious!! The bacon in the burger was definitely an awesome surprise!"}
{"text":"I had an aioli burger from the food truck at Kierland (yay for coming to Kierland!). I tried the Black and Bleu burger, it was good. I got the burger without a bun (lame). My only complaint is that it was loaded with sauce and very, almost overwhelmingly 'peppery' I guess that's to be expected with a 'black and bleu.' The fries were outstanding! I got a side of the truffle aioli to dip them in and I was in heaven. I definitely recommend those fries and that aioli."}
{"text":"This truck was at the Glendale Glitter and was one of the more appealing options besides the fry bread, lobster mac and turkey leg there when making our rounds to see what we should try to stuff our faces with. The bf and I ordered burgers and got the free fries for checking in. He got the cali burger and I got their aioli burger. The garlic aioli we asked for on the side for the fries was yum. My burger was a bit dry and bland for me. I ordered medium for the patty but it was dry so I know it was well done. Couldn't taste the aioli in my burger either. Could have used some pickles or something for a kick in your mouth factor. I don't know. This place had a lot of potential to be really good and I really wanted to like it because who doesn't like aioili  but sorry guys- you failed miserably at it in my case.   p.s.  there was a hair in my fries too :("}
{"text":"First time I tried Aioli Burger I had the California burger. It was delicious, I HIGHLY recommend this food truck to anyone! I also had them booked to have their truck come to my work for lunch. I can't wait to try other burgers they offer."}
{"text":"Great black and blue burger at a very friendly food truck.   The sweet potato fries were spot on.   I don't know how it is price wise because I got a free burger.  But I would have paid a premium it was so fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow!  The only reason I tried one was because they came to my apartment building. I'm not a big Burger fan.  However- I am now a big fan of this tasty treat! I think I'm going to have to hunt them down to try that same yummy burger just one more time!!  I had the Black and Blue burger.  Two big things: The bun. Perfection !!! Thin.  Crispyish Delicious!  Never had one better. The beef. Smooth and very fine texture. Delicious- like gourmet steak. What is this beef?  Is it the prep? I don't know- but it made a believer out of a 95 percent non- beef eater!  Those sweet potato fries were no slouch either. After this- I went to a local joint with the word Red - and a bird in the name. I never go there. I just wanted to see what they offered in the same price range.  Ya know- apples (and burgers) to apples. Ok. Edible. But good? Not quite. Close to this baby they serve? Not even!  You guys rock!! I'd better stay away- you'll have me eating beef again!  That's saying something ! (And I swear I'm having one more before I stop) Sorry- no photos. All gone too fast!!!"}
{"text":"So delicious, I had the aioli burger and sweet potato fries.  Didnt care for the bun or the butter or whatever they brushed on the bun, would probably get lettuce wrap next time.  Also very generous portion of fries,  could only eat 1/2 of them.  Truffle oil aioli was recommended but didnt have much flavor. However the sweet potato fries were very tasty without the aioli, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  You gotta get your aioli on!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Yum Yum Yum. This place has really great burgers!!!"}
{"text":"I tried to get a simple menu for a upcoming event  And after a week of asking for something to be put together for me and even a phone call NOTHING!! I understand people get busy but a simple return call or email would have been nice. I went with another food truck for my event Thank you"}
{"text":"It's food truck day at the office.  I wasn't sure what to expect but I ordered the FALAFEL burger and the Caprese salad. Wholly COW. AMAZING. Like, I want to stalk the truck amazing. Like, if it wasn't 1:00 and the trucks were leaving, I would run back out just to get another so I could have it for dinner tonight. Literally, the best burger I have EVER  eaten (outside of home of course lol) And the caprese salad was made perfectly. I'm in love."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying Aioli Burgers at a catered event (so while I did not pay for my burger directly, I paid for the event). I had the California burger and it was good, but maybe not as good as I would think it would be considering the ingredients. The egg was overdone... it said it was sunny side... it wasn't. Regardless, the burger tasted good and the different aiolis were tasty. The fries were crispy and pleasant and the Husband enjoyed his burger (Italiano). I would give them a shot if I were to see them out and about."}
{"text":"The truck was at the Scottsdale Date Night event at the Scottsdale Stadium on a Saturday. Their burger's ingredients caught my attention. I got the set burger, fries, and a drink for $11.   White Truffle Swiss Burger - I chose this trying to go for a 'healthier' option, and I love mushrooms! It's a big burger. You can definitely pack half of it for dinner especially if you got fries. The burger had plenty of mushrooms, but it could've had a bit more of the aioli sauce. Still, it was a delicious burger. I finished it and the fries.   Fries - I normally wouldn't have ordered fries but I needed water. It was a better deal with the set. I'm so glad I did though. These were cooked perfectly! These are the type of fries that have that crunchy-ness but not because they were over fried. It has that kind of 'coating' and flavor. It's hard to explain, but I would want my fries cooked like this every time. I would give it a try or share an order with a friend. The fries complemented the burger well.   My review sounds like I enjoyed the fries more than the burger, but I just wasn't expecting the fries to taste so good."}
{"text":"This place was extremely busy & crowded. Although the flavors were nice the food wasn't actually that good. The burger and fries were not bad. The presentation is  tacky, but this is a new establishment so it's understandable.  Worth giving it a try for sure though."}
{"text":"Aioli burger is the best food truck that I have eaten at. There food is fresh and their customer service is amazing. One experience in particular really stood out to me; they had come with their food truck to a collegiate sporting event and one of their employees, Alec, was friendly to everyone even though it was extremely busy and not every customer was nice to him. I would definitely recommend Aioli Burger to other people, you should definitely try them! And, if you need a recommendation, my personal favorite is the Italiano burger with fries and basil garlic aioli!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger, fries, friendly staff and quick service only problem I had was the bun was a little stale. I will give them another try for sure it was at the end of Lunch."}
{"text":"Disgusting burger ever, we had this at an company event recently and ordered 4 aioli burgers, all of them were still raw and greasy. Not a medium rare either, completely raw and went into the trash. I wasn't the only one with the same problem, lots of others who ordered from this food truck had the same issue."}
{"text":"I have an extreme aversion to mayonnaise and aioli. Not only do I dislike the flavor but also it just plain grosses me out. I guess because I don't eat eggs that often. Needless to say, I really did not want any aioli on my burger. So even though I felt a little silly about it, I walked right up to the truck and ordered their signature namesake burger without the sauce. \"OK, one aioli burger without the aioli\" the guy confirmed with a smile. \"Anything else?\" Why yes, I'll have some french fries for free with my Yelp check-in please. Another smile. \"No problem.\"  Great service and reasonable prices had made me happy with this food truck already. But a few moments later when I tasted my burger I was even happier. It was very juicy, perfectly cooked with a great flavor. I loved the toasted bun, it was somehow both soft and crispy at the same time. The cheddar cheese added a lot of flavor without too much greasiness. Similarly, the shaved onions were a welcome addition without overwhelming. It was just a really tasty burger. The fries weren't bad either. And I loved their house made katsup. Most places make theirs too sweet but this one was perfect.  Good job aioli burger! Looking forward to seeing your truck again soon."}
