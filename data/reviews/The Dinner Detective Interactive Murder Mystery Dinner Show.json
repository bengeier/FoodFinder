{"text":"I experienced this dinner for the first time a few days ago and I thought it was amazing! It was a birthday gift and I thought they did great with the entire show, from the actors, to the clues, and even involving many of the people there in their show! I gave 4 stars only because for the price of the event, I feel soft drinks should be included, but you have to pay each time 3 dollars for a glass that could be compared to a child's cup! Other than that everything was great,even the food! I ordered the chicken meal it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to personally thank you for everything you and your group did for our group Saturday.  The actors and Jamie went above and beyond and were nothing short of amazing! Everyone had an absolute blast! Your actors were awesome and you can tell they love what they do! They explained everything before the show to us, insiders and really helped with the story line. We had so many in the group tricked. The looks on everyone's faces through out the show were just incredible. Everything from smiles, confused, shocked etc. After the show, your actors even stuck around to talk to my group. They were so personable and a lot of fun to be around!!  We cannot thank you all enough! I would recommend this to family and friends hands down! I'm still getting compliments from my coworkers! Please pass along my gratitude!"}
{"text":"Holy cheese balls!   I don't even know where to begin with this one.  Overall, the entire thing was super cheesy - essentially a bad community theater performance.  Let's start with the venue.  I had originally thought the Omni would be a good venue for this - sort of upscale and historic and fitting with an elegant murder mystery.  In reality, it was a boring conference room with boring conference room tables and boring conference room food.  Instead of mood lighting, there was work lighting.   Anyway, I dressed up as requested and arrived at the conference area for check-in and a pre-dinner cocktail party.  Check-in was a the far end of a very crowded room and you had to ask in order to know that.  I made a special effort to print my confirmation page as required (because who prints that kind of thing now?), but no one even looked at it.   Then back across the room again to wait in line for drink tickets.  Then to the actual bar to wait in line for a drink.  Cumbersome at best. To top it off, it was HOT - we were all sweating because we were packed in there like sardines.     On to the table...we sat down in the conference room with maybe 90 other people.  Slightly wilted salads with soggy croutons were at the table already and we got started once they brought some extra dressing (both options were empty before they made it all the way around the table).  The waitstaff service was good throughout - what I would expect of the Omni.  The meal was fine, but nothing to write home about.    The show stopped and started throughout the evening and was again, just super cheesy.  After salads, we were given a list of questions and asked to awkwardly mingle with the other guests.  I knew it was coming, but didn't love this part.  I just felt like I was at work event making small talk.   The rest of the clues came out over the course of the dinner in the form of an introduction scene from the detectives and then a couple of laminated sheets of paper that each table had to pass around and share.  We had a guy at our table who was really into it and sort of monopolized the clue sheets, so I didn't really bother to spend any time on them.  The whole thing just sort of dragged on and on, especially at the end when they had to read and evaluate everyone's guesses.  I won't ruin the mystery for those who want to give this a shot, but the answer was pretty obvious.     Next, let's talk about value.  I paid almost $70 (really almost $90 since they charged a $20 change fee to change  may date more than a month in advance).  $18 or something to park in the garage. Plus four drink tickets for around $10 a piece (needed every one of those drinks to get through the evening).  Even if I hadn't been drinking alcohol, I'd have still had to pay for soda and such.   Several people in the room paid extra to be suspects and participate - I'd have been really peeved if I'd done that because all it gets you is a chance to stand up and answer a couple of scripted questions.   At the end, they ask you to tip the actors; so all told, I was into this for over $150 - way too much for the experience.     In the end, I really expected an elegant evening with a good show that made me think.  What I got was a muddled conference charade that made me feel like I was suffering through yet another work conference event."}
{"text":"Reservations were easy to make and I enjoyed the whole experience but definitely felt like it was more amateur-level for the high price. There are no discounts or specials so it's $60 a person for a simple 3-course meal and a mildly amusing show. The main actors needed some more practice with their lines. The one detective was really good though. The story and evidence pieces were not very good. There needs to be better writing. The food was just okay. I got the fish with Asian glaze and the chocolate cake dessert was amazing but none of it felt very fancy or worth the $60. You'll be full but not impressed. I thought soft drinks would at least be covered but they weren't. You either get water or coffee.   I didn't mind the hotel venue but it would have been more atmospheric to rent out an old mansion or Victorian house or something. The single conference room felt cramped and small. I still had a good time but would not really recommend it for a second time. Perhaps in another city with more reviews?"}
{"text":"I appreciated the effort in this show. I overall had a great time. Just a few constructive tips... upon arriving, I was completely overwhelmed with how many people were tucked into a tiny room. The check-in and process, name tags and getting drink tickets was totally disorganized and hard to handle. There should be either lines set up or some way to make it better. The drinks were severely over priced. $9.75 for one drink?! We paid $58 to get in! I know that the hotel is nice and everything and the downtown Pittsburgh atmosphere has higher priced drinks but... when you pay $58 to get in, there should be some value in pricing on drinks. $7 is a lot easier to swallow. Dinner good. Chicken was tasty and I liked the desert. Overall, I did have a nice time!"}
