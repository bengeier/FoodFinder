{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants to take special friends.  They have a counter where you can eat and watch the cooks work GIANT woks under a whimsical dragon head.  The real fun happens if you can snag one of the sit-down tables, since you have to take your shoes off, step up onto tatami mats and then sit cross-legged while you munch.  How fun!  The restroom is always clean and pleasant smelling.  I recommend the Gado Gado, for the peanut blast."}
{"text":"Used to be such a great little restaurant but it has gone down. Food is tasteless, portions are small, service is ordinary. Don't know what they did but it ain't what it used to be."}
{"text":"What a great, charming little place! I've visited it about 5 times and each time I order a new great unique tasting dish ( so far all were great!) I might not be a food expert but i know what tastes good- not a professional (ahem, snobby review). For a small place, my expectations are perfectly met by friendly staff, warm amiable atmosphere, quick service and an inexpensive meal. TOTALLY AUTHENTIC."}
{"text":"If you go there, you absolutely need to try the \"grosses nouilles de farine blanche avec gros légumes dans la sauce sonya\"! Seriously, one of the worst pad thaï I've been eating ever. Chow Mein was just ok. Service was, hey, terrible."}
{"text":"Tampopo used to be a good place but now is really disappointing. The pad thai is extremely blend and barely has any taste and same goes for the soup. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. As mentioned in other reviews, the green Buddha is an initial magnet to the walkers-by on Mont-Royal. Then, at the threshold of the restaurant, the inside decor is beautifully Asian-inspired, very warm and soothing to the senses. Upon getting our food however, my two friends and myself were either underwhelmed by a lack of flavour, or overwhelmed by too much salt. If they could get the food right, this place could have a line out the door, I'm certain."}
{"text":"Restaurant qui pourrait être très sympa en terme de cuisine.. nous avons commandé une soupe tonkinoise et un pad Thai au poulet. Nos plats étaient sans goût.. nous n'avons pas réussi à terminer nos assiettes. De plus, la cuisine ouverte était très sale. Nous ne recommandons pas cet établissement !"}
{"text":"Noodles are quite enjoyable and varied. There are three  (or so) tables on the floor + pillows. The rest is bar seating."}
{"text":"They say you can't judge a book by its cover . . . turns out you can't judge a restaurant by its decor, either. I will start by saying that my boyfriend and I really wanted to like this place - It's so cute, and we love pad thai. How could anything go wrong?   We went to Tampopo on a Monday evening, and it was as crowded as a Friday. This seemed like a good sign to us. The waitress was really friendly, and she apologized profusely for the fact that their beer tap was broken, which meant they only had bottled Tsing Tao. This turned out to be the best thing about the meal. We ordered appetizers which never came. When we were finally presented with our main dishes 30 minutes after ordering, I asked if the appetizers would be coming after the main course. The waitress seemed shocked and brought us our ticket to show that our appetizers had been \"checked off.\" I get that this wasn't her mistake, but where did the appetizers go?  I ordered the vegan Ramen, which was decent, but it . . . wasn't really Ramen? More like straight up noodles in a coconut broth. My boyfriend ordered the pad thai, which was a bit strange. It looked kind of green. He says it tasted \"like someone tried to make pad thai out of lipton chicken soup.\" People kept pouring in. The staff kept telling them they could squeeze them in even though they were clearly understaffed. I was so confused. Boyfriend wound up taking his beef dumplings to go, which he says taste as if you drenched chef Boyardee ravioli in peanut sauce (i.e., weird). I decided to forgo my appetizer because I just didn't have any confidence that it would be very good at that point, and we really wanted to leave this inexplicably crowded place.  I agree with some of the other yelpers who have pointed out some obvious red flags, like why would you trust a bunch of white people to make Asian food? And too many items on the menu is a serious red flag. It's a shame, because the environment and location are really great."}
{"text":"What attracted me to this place is the traditional Japanese style cushion on floor seating arrangement. We weren't able to score a table so had to sit at the bar,  but it was configured in a way that allowed for good conversation dynamics between 2 couples. I ordered the Bami Goren and it was BANGIN GLORIOUS. Classified as Indonesian cuisine I found the flavours to be just that and the serving to be generous. My husband got the Toban, which is a Szechuan noodle dish. I'll be going back for a donburi sometime soon and it's my mission to be seated on the floor!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this yesterday and were absolutely delighted. We got the vegetable ramen soup, gado gado, and ravioli appetizer. The place was charming and we wished we could have stayed but were with our dog. They had our take out ready in five minutes. We want to go back and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Service absolument inacceptable,  J'habite à 3 coins de rue et la livraison a pris plus de une heure 45 de livraison, j'ai appelé et je me suis fait dire qu'il etait désolé mais normal...."}
{"text":"Toujours sympathique, toujours aussi bon, toujours autant dans l'assiette, ...et toujours un lunch pour le lendemain !"}
{"text":"I'd been curious about this place for a while, because of the big, green Buddha mural on the outside, visible when you're walking down Mont Royal. We decided to go in for a dinner tonight and were not disappointed!   The vibe is great - walk in and seat yourself, either at the counter overlooking the tidy kitchen, or at one of the traditional-style settings where you remove your shoes and sit on mats at low tables. It reminded me a lot of my experiences of dining in Bali. Our server was extremely attentive and on the ball, and quite friendly without being obtrusive.   We chose to sit at the kitchen counter, which was actually really fun. We watched the kitchen staff prepare our meals with a little bit of showmanship, craftfully flinging vegetables into the two large woks. Everyone in the kitchen seemed to really like each other, too.   The wait time for our main dishes was really reasonable and the serving sizes were EXCELLENT value for the cost. I also asked about whether or not they use MSG in the food, and to my delight, they do not. Our food was served steaming hot and was very good. I ordered the Tampopo noodles, which come with shrimp and a black bean sauce, and there were tons of shrimp in my bowl, which was great! I'm used to restaurants skimping on the shrimp, but not these guys.   I left with a very full belly and a good feeling about coming back again. They do delivery in the cute takeout boxes, too, so maybe next time I'll order in just for kicks."}
{"text":"Noodle time! I came for noodles and I was not disappointed.  I'll admit that I came here for ramen and accidentally ordered not-ramen. What's more, I didn't immediately realize that the Udon noodles I ordered actually came as soba noodles ... I'll have to update my review once I've tried the ramen properly, but in the meantime, I'll comment on the noodles anyway! NB that the ramen is not listed in their menu but rather on signs on the wall and chopstick tins; the Japanese soup on the menu is *not* ramen.  Vegetarian options here are fairly good; the ramen broth is vegan, and while the other soup broths are omnivore-only, they'll switch out meat for tofu in any of the other dishes. My partner got vegetarian ramen which came with copious amounts of noodles plus mushrooms, corn, green onion, and a tasty egg that had been marinated in a slightly sweet sauce. The broth was a coconut-tahini broth that was rich like you'd expect from ramen, but had a Thai vibe. I ended up eating a lot of his noodles and they were tasty!  My Japanese noodle soup came with a bunch of veggies including mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots, in a shiitake mushroom broth with bonito flakes. I liked the broth but there was something a bit off about it ... possibly the bonito (which I don't especially like), or the fact that it wasn't the ramen broth I was initially expecting. Nevertheless, a decent value at $12 including tax/tip.  We also had vegetarian spring rolls which were pretty good, and dessert including crème brûlé (great) and lychees in syrup (mediocre).  I'm not usually a big décor woman but I was a big fan of the décor here as it created a nice, cozy Japanese vibe (including the tiny space).  Overall I had a four-star experience but I will mention that some of the cons listed in other reviews are legit: it's not the best or most ramen-y ramen you'll find in town, and it is pretty small and crowded (we went on a Thursday evening).  As for those reviews casting aspersions on the chefs for their Euro ethnic background, this seems more to do with hipster anxieties about how \"authentic\" something is being indicative of, or more important than, its quality. (Presumably they'd find the food better if it was cooked by people with authentic Asian DNA.) An interesting, and in this context ironic, factoid: the restaurant's namesake is a 1985 Japanese comedy film about a(n ethnically Japanese) woman, Tampopo, who owns a struggling ramen restaurant and must learn how to make good ramen noodles."}
{"text":"Hey Tampopo, plusieurs fois que je viens te voir et je t'ai jamais rien dit de ce que je pensais. Mieux vaut tard que jamais :) Tu nous fais goûter des bons plats asiatique que cela soit des soupes, des plats à base de nouille, etc ... Je suis déjà venu plusieurs et tu comprend pourquoi, car je suis satisfait de mes expériences et discussion avec toi. J'aime notamment t'appeler en amont de ma visite pour que tu me prépares tes plats et que je les rapporte à la maison ou dans un parc limitrophe. Je pense qu'on va continuer à se voir dans le futur, cette petite touche d'Asie que tu me fournis je l'aime bien ! A la revoyure poto"}
{"text":"I expected it to be somewhat inauthentic, but the result was even below my expectations. The tom yum soup reminds me of coconut-flavoured instant noodle broth, completely missing the hot and sour elements, and the yakisoba resembles chowmein, and was broken-up and too salty. I couldn't finish my food and I'm the type that always cleans the plate! However, service was friendly, the idea of sitting on the tatami mats a cute idea but felt gimmicky when you took in the rest of the restaurant's decor."}
{"text":"While perhaps not the best Chinese food I have ever had, I often frequent this really cute little restaurant for lunch when I am shopping on Mont-Royal and in the mood for Chinese. I love the ambiance. I have often thought about dining at one of the low-riding tables and sitting on a pillow but since I am always dining alone and I don't want to take up a whole table by myself; I simply ensconce myself at the bar. The lunch specials are reasonably priced and the service is quick and I am sucker for when restaurants have a big and inviting open-kitchen, like the one at Tampopo. Also, I love the warm towelettes that are given before the meal. What a nice touch! It's a keeper!"}
{"text":"Service rapide et livraison par vélo (très Plateau ;) ). Bonnes portions servies dans les fameuses boîtes comme dans les films à New York. Les plats de nouilles sont délicieux, mais très salés. La soupe tonkinoise n'a par contre peu à voir avec la vraie chose. On dirait plus une soupe repas d'inspiration asiatique."}
{"text":"This place doesn't really deserve a thorough review... It is simply not an authentic asian restaurant. You can tell by the menu when they offer thaï, chinese, singapourian, malaysian and indonesian, it certainly is not a good sign! The only positive thing was that our waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the place is cute. The food? Not so much. Their ramen version taste anything but ramen. Also, I'm not a fan of grounded meat in my soup, although the soup base was quite interesting, tasted more like a spicy coconut laksa."}
{"text":"They are trying to do too much: worst laksa i ever had, worst tom yum and singapour noodles. I live literally 1 min walk and never go there except twice to give them a second chance, actually 3, mistake. Maybe there pho is good i am actially willing to go back for that, but frankly when there's only white people behind the counter making all the asian country noodle with an asian cashier looks just wrong. For white people it may seem like an attractive asian noodle place but really when you try to cook all the asian country food your being too unrealistic. Like the master of none.I do like the decor and set up, sitting on the floor with cushions very original, it feels very zen."}
