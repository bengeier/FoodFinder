{"text":"I always go here on lunch for a quick salad or wrap.

Beware though, its very easy to overload your salad and get charged more (its per weight)

For the wraps, I've had chicken and vegetarian and both are really good. (Go to is wrap with Asiago, Hummus, Portebello and Grilled Red Peppers)

They always have around 2-3 soups on hand too.  Most are gluten and dairy free."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch for the salads. I've never had any of their cooked foods, soups, or sushi. 

Salad is charged by the weight but they have absolutely everything. The two basics are romaine lettuce and spring mix. Then they have grilled asparagus, mushrooms, avocado, nuts and dried fruits, different kinds of cheese, grilled chicken, tuna, just to name a few. It's great for salad lovers who enjoys premium toppings but don't want to pay $1-2 extra for a quarter of an avocado or a sprinkle of cheese. My biggest issue here is the fact that the Caesar dressing is a bit spicy/tangy. So I tend to put a small amount. .

It's a sit down place and obviously gets busy between 12 - 2pm. There's also free cold water!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They have a fantastic salad bar. Sushi is ready-to-go, but they will also prepare it to order for you. They have brown rice and white rice. Prices are good."}
{"text":"The only time I've ever ordered from this place they got essentially every aspect of my order wrong. When I called to let them know I was passed to the owner, who, despite my being completely polite and reasonable about the situation, proceeded to berate me and acuse me of basically trying to pull one over on him. In his mind, there was absolutely no way he could have made a mistake (I had confirmed the order multiple times). Basically the food is okay, the service is awful."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing salad bar. It's seriously awesome. super awesome.
It has all the usual things you'd expect of a salad bar and in addition some awesome toppings. Awesome toppings include (but not limited to) olives (green/black - and the good ones), roasted garlic cloves, HUGE pieces of avocado, mango, spicy chick peas, tofu, all the nuts you could ever want, sunflower sprouts. 

They do breakfast/egg bagels etc but are sorely lacking is the sweet stuff (no muffins or croissants or anything like that at this place).

They have a nice selection of loose leaf teas.

The place is super clean and neat and if  I didn't work above this place I wouldn't even know to go (it seems kinda hidden in the back of the first floor). It's  good for a to go lunch or with coworkers as this place has a very cafeteria feel to it.

MINUS - the americano sucks big time,  super weak and barely coffee tasting. :(
PLUS - they provide soy milk."}
{"text":"Had their sandwich special. Was chicken breast with grilled eggplant and zucchini. Comes w a side of salad. Was really good. A really big real piece of chicken breast sliced before you. Will go back"}
{"text":"Sushi and Salad Fresh to Go is a small simple place that delivers (no surprise) Sushi and Salad and additionaly they also do paninis and soups. Their sushi and salads are fresh and clean which is very important with raw food.  Most of their sushis revolve around the basic ingredients of salmon, avocado, cream cheese, and imitation crab.  So they vary with california and philly rolls, along with salmon sushi and maki.  Although not a huge selection, it is a convenient location for office dwellers nearby to get their quick sushi fix to go."}
