{"text":"Pretty good, I really liked the chicken salad, a lot if flavor, but the service isn't too great. They aren't that friendly, but the service isn't too great."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was very bad. Chicken was dry and tuff. Mac and cheese was tasteless. Mashed potatoes were similar to KFC but a little more tasteless"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the friendly guy at the register and the speed with the which our Bacon Cheese Monster fries came out. But, they are not good. The cheese is fake of from a can or something and it looks like they gave a single slice of cheap bacon. I'm drunk and it isn't even that good. Such a let down."}
{"text":"Booked at Venetian and it's a 3 minutes walk towards this place, very close. Ordered 5 piece tenders with 2 sides for $12 after we left pool. We're pretty much filled up and it's pretty tasty. Price is fair too."}
{"text":"The tenders are super moist and the sides are decent.  One must eat the Texas Toast while it's still hot."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. They suckered me in with a chicken tender sample and I was too tired to hunt for something else more \"quality\". I had the 3 tender basket with Mac n cheese and cucumber salad. The tenders were juicy, but kind of bland by themselves. Definitely needed the buffalo sauce. The Mac n cheese was pretty standard, but the cucumber salad was not good. It was very bland and the cucumbers had a very thick chewy skin. Overall not bad (and cheap for Vegas) but don't get the cucumber salad and be sure to get some sauce!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, juicy, crispy chicken and sandwiches. Reminds me of Chick fil a. Bread was soft and fresh, and fries were fat and extra crispy. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I saw this place and decided to stop by here with my luggage before i flew out. Best chicken i had in my life when i was at the airport.  The last person i met worked there, She's cool and we still keep in contact. Thanks for the Friend and Awesome chicken strips.  Note- The Grandma sauce that I did not want accidentally spilled on my chicken when going to the airport. That was the best thing to happen to them.  Heading back to vegas again just for the strips. (chicken strips)"}
{"text":"Worth every penny staff is super nice and food is amazing my man and I loved the sauces they have. We sampled some and when we sampled other foods we came back to them. Amazing food amazing staff great service."}
{"text":"Slow but chicken is tasty. Expensive. Located in the Venetian food court. We ordered the Caesar salad with tenders.  It was very tasty and juicy."}
