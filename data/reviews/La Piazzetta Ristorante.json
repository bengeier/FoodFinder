{"text":"Going there for dinner and it is a Hong Kong style upscale Italian restaurant.  The food is average and relatively the price is expensive.  We have Seafood Combo that comes with Lobster bisque, Seafood pasta and tea/coffee that costs $35.99.  Changing to a different dessert Tiramisu or Cheese cake added another $3.  That is almost $40 dinner combo that you can go to a real Italian restaurant.  The other combo we ordered are 6oz lobster $33.99, 10oz steak, sole fillet, pig knuckle. The steak is ok.  The pig knuckle expected to have more meat but the one served has more skin than meat.  They have other set dinner that ranges from $20 to $30+  There is a live singer all the way singing all the various Asian songs.  If you consider the restaurant to be a sing and lounge, may be it can justified the price of the meal."}
{"text":"So when you book a room here, it comes with free breakfast. The FREE breakfast includes.., CEREAL, TOAST, FRUITS ... And that's all.   If you want a hot breakfast, aka 2 eggs, fries (home fries?), and either bacon, ham or sausages for $4 per person.   Okay yea I know it's free and all for the cold toast and fruits but still... I would expect more from a hotel breakfast.   Ps it's crazy empty inside. No shitz, I mean who would want this??"}
{"text":"Quality is below average and the prices do not reflect that. I ordered the salmon salad ($13), the salmon was good but it's quite evident that the salad base was very cheap - 90% iceberg lettuce. The coffee was stale and it didn't taste like coffee at all and their HK style cafe wasn't very good either.   I would say, however, that their pork cutlet looked worth getting, it was $14 with two pieces of large porkchops. Service overall was meh."}
{"text":"La Piazzetta Ristorante is a Hong Kong style cafe serving a Western menu located in a smallish Hotel in Markham.   But everything is much more upscale than your typical HK style cafe except the pricing.     This is my go-to place in the region when wanting a pleasant sit-down, but non-Asian and casual meal at reasonable prices.    I've yet to come across a close 2nd...thus the 4 stars here."}
{"text":"It was okay - this is more of a Chinese Western restaurant so don't expect anything authentic. We came for lunch and I got the meatballs with linguine in tomato basil sauce. The sauce was very very bland - like no flavor at all. The meatballs were alright. My boyfriend got the German sausage with pork chop and that was pretty good - much better than mine.   The restaurant looks a bit old school but service was friendly and pretty quick."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for lunch and it's not bad considering the price. Lunch meals come with a hot beverage, soup /salad, main and dessert coffee/tea. Price range is good and the portions are decent depending on what you get. The chicken steak and pork chops are by far the best value. One large chicken thigh deboned and butterflied is quite large but I have to say the pork chop meal comes with TWO large pork chops! Just don't expect anything to blow you out of the water. It's mediocre food for a good price.... Not as good as HK cafes. Their starter soups are nothing special, choose from cream of mushroom, borscht or add $2 for French onion - but trust me when I say this, don't bother. Most of the patrons are over 50 LOL"}
{"text":"The food was not really good. As another reviewer said, it unfortunately tasted like food from a can. It's more if a HK cafe style. Way over priced for what you get but I did enjoy the karaoke. People here seem to be regulars and also quite good singers. :) the dessert was pretty good as a panacotta."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and dinner before.  It's more of an \"upscale\" Westernized-Chinese cafe offering pastas and meat dishes.   For dinner, they have set menus: appetizer, main, dessert, drink for 16.99-29.99. I ordered the Honey Mustard Pork Chop - two HUGE pieces of pork served with choice of potato/vegetables or rice/vegetables. I always worry pork will be dry and hard but this was okay. The sauce was pretty good - a sweet honey sauce, couldn't taste the mustard. For appetizer, I chose Lobster Bisque, quite heavy and salty for my taste. On the other hand, the salads looked much better! Spring greens with raspberry/pink dressing, onion, cucumber, tomato, and smoked salmon or parma ham.  Dessert was a icy-tasting chocolate/cream cake.   When I went on Friday night, it was \"karaoke night\" where they had someone perform old songs for the duration of our meal. Sitting right beside the 'stage' area, it was too loud for our group, but I guess older guests would enjoy this type of entertainment."}
{"text":"Hong Kong style western restaurant, not quite Italian nor French restaurant.  Environment is nice, Staff are friendly, and service is good.  But not the food quality, and it's a bit over-priced.  Good for large group of people tho."}
{"text":"I have only been at the Monte Carlo to eat at this restaurant and each time the quality of food disappoints me.  Staff: Friendly and helpful. They usually get our food and drink orders quick and they come in a timely manner.  Ambience: Nothing special to note. Each time we come it is a larger party and they give us a long table, but they don't have long tablecloths so there's a lot of overlap of small tablecloths on the table making it lack that professional touch. On this Halloween occasion they did decorate with Halloween items, but it was odd to see a bloody machete prop dangling above your head while you eat.  Food: Everything seems like it comes out of the box. The fish and chips is the saddest plate I've ever seen. It is a square piece of fish with fries all lackadaisically placed on the plate. Someone I knew ordered the pizza and it was very soggy on the bottom and the pineapple tasted like it was from a can. My friend had the pork chops and they have a nice sweet glaze on it which wasn't too bad but the side veggies look like it came out of a frozen bag. I had the pasta linguine with meatballs and it tasted good but I wish the meatballs were homemade.  As a hotel restaurant they need to step up their game a little. I suggest sticking to the pastas and/or pork chops!"}
{"text":"3.5 With all the negative reviews, I was prepared to be super offended eating here, but I was in fact quite pleasantly surprised that I very much enjoyed my meal. First impressions of this place is weird, it's located inside a local inn and you access the restaurant through a back door. Because we are Chinese, wait staff greeted us in Chinese and told us to sit anywhere. It smells a little funny in the restaurant and the ceilings were quite low.  I ordered the Chicken Steak in a baby spinach cream sauce (even its naming convention is so Chinese Western food lol), which in essence in a huge piece of boneless, skin on dark meat in creamed spinach sauce. Chicken was well seasoned, skin was crisp and meat was tender. Baby spinach was soft and not over cooked. Mash and grilled veggies on the side are also tasty. My sister had sausage and pork chop and it was also quite tasty. Portions seem reasonable for the price. Overall, I don't think it's bad food. It's a different style of food that most Chinese kids will feel nostalgic about, since this is the typical \"White food\" we know and love from back home. No, this is no milestones and will not offer you the chicken breast or steak you were looking for, but the quality for those prices, I'm not mad."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst communicating I've ever seen in my entire foodie life. I'm not usually this mean, but from stepping into the restaurant to getting seated was the worst!   The lady decided to put us at the back of the entire room while there was room at the front to watch performances. Note that we did do reservations for a Father's Day event. Why should my father and his family be sitting in the back where there is no lighting, while you have tons of tables at the front where there is sufficient lighting to see what you're eating?!   As I got seated, I realized I had this candle sitting in front of my face and it was really starting to burn up and i just have smoke running through my nose. I blew it out and the waiter decided it would be fun to re-light it again. I told him that it has been smoke up my face for a very long time now. He finally understood the hint.  The food was not really great and the soup tasted like it was from a canned soup. I had the Clam Chowder while my family got the Lobster Bisque. Tasted really thick and just didn't like it at all. The food was overpriced for what you get.  One positive mention is that they had Karaoke night on a Friday and the singer was really good. It seems that there are the many regulars who come here to eat and then sing after and have a good time. The atmosphere after the dinner was very nice and relaxing.   Not recommending people who want to have good food to come here."}
{"text":"I could not stop smiling when I read the description on their website about  La Piazzetta Ristorante, \"Exploring Fine Italian, French and Mediterrean Cuisines\".  The La Piazzetta Ristorante is located inside Monte Carlo Inn.  The deco of the restaurant is quite nice and charming. I was there for lunch and they do have set lunch for $6.99.  I ordered the Set Lunch A Meat Ball Linguine. The price is great $6.99 includes soup, garlic bread and drink.  Please beware you are not eating in a \"fine\" Italian restaurant. You are eating in a Hong Kong Style western restaurant....  then you will be ok.  The Russian Borscht soup is good and steaming hot! There are tons of fresh vegetables inside: cabbage and carrots. This Borscht does not really resemble any authentic Russian cuisine.. if you been to any Hong Kong Style restaurant you will know what I mean. I think they better off naming it as vegetable soup!  The pasta at least is Al dente. The sauce tastes like something you get from a can, same with the meat balls, some frozen ones you get from the supermarket. I have to give them credit for putting in fresh green/red pepper, mushrooms and onions in the sauce.   For the price and the environment as a Hong Kong Style Western restaurant I will give 3 stars. But as a Fine restaurant it is a 2 stars.  The service is nice and friendly and prompt!  They accepts all credit cards. Though there are some dinner specials are cash only."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Hong Kong westernized style restaurant.  Not many selection.  Baked pork chop in tomatoes sauce w rice was ok.  But the shrimp pasta in lobster sauce was bland.  I expected better food quality from a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"This is located inside Monte Carlo Inn. The restaurant is relatively smallish.  I only saw 2 waitors/waitress and the manager/ owner. There was a 4-course meal that included soup (lobster bisque/ clam chowder) or salad (cesear salad or smoke salmon salad), an entree from the menu, dessert (daily) and coffee/ tea.   I ordered the Clam Chowder for appetizer and Atlantic Salmon with Terriyaki sauce. The chowder was kind of fishy cause of the clams i guess. I have never had that happen to me before. The Atlantic Salmon took over 30 minutes to come after finishing the appetizer. When it finally arrived, the salmon was small. Rice/ pasta was available with the entree. I chose rice but never knew it would be that little. Also, the salmon, in my opinon, it was seared a little too long for my liking. The sauce was not Terriyaki. It was more soya sauce then sweetness.   Dessert was a mango mousse cake. They used have panna cotta but they didnt have it tonight.   Btw, if you plan on going frequently, then I recommend you getting the 10% discount card. The only bad thing is that you can only pay cash and not credit when using it."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who suggested going to Monte Carlo.  I was thinking that was a hotel and thought the price would be exorbitant.  However, I checked Yelp! before and they did say it wasn't too bad price wise.  I have to say ambiance and food quality was relatively hotel level.  The price isn't though.  If I had to compare against Firefly which is close to this restaurant in terms of food, this is SO MUCH better and surprisingly CHEAPER for what you would pay for at Firefly.  Although the food was good, it's still too pricey and far to be a default restaurant, but don't let that hold you off, it's still good and I would take friends and clients there.  As for food, I had the standard HK cafe multi-course meal: soup, salad main and dessert with a side of coffee/tea and bread.  I spent about $25 with tips.  I started with a lobster bisque which is pretty much water with a little bit of lobster chunks.  However, it is still quite flavorful if not filling.  It made me hungrier though, good thing there was a side of bread to tide me by.  Then I had the abalone salad.  I doubt it's one of those high grade abalone, but it still has the texture and the salt-watery after aroma I expect and like from abalone.  It was also given in reasonably sized chunks so it's not too bad.  For the main, because I was feeling cheap, I opted for the cheapest thing on their multi course menu which was the Crab Meat Pasta.  Oohh that was yummy.  Maybe because I had a hankering for mac and cheese with some shellfish for hte past few days and this just hit the spot.  For dessert we got pina colada pudding.  I never had pina colada pudding before.  I do like it.  Especially since this had no extra charge compared to the standard cheese cake.  For tea, they provided us with proper English tea.  So we assembled our own HK style milk tea.  It tasted so much better than the ones you get from the other HK cafes.  The waiter service was good, not super duper good, but good for the price range you are getting into.  However, it's more expensive on Friday to Sunday so I won't bother going at those times (plus I hear there is Karaoke at those times ugh)."}
