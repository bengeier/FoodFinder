{"text":"We are from California where we have our share of great restraurants. Viana Sol is superb! We lingered (for 4 wondrous hours) over steak tartar, kangaroo, salmon, rack of lamb, medallions of filet mignon and liver and onions.   We were greeted very warmly, never felt rushed, the staff was very attentive keeping wine and water glasses filled and bread baskets refilled without being asked. So very surprised to see kangaroo on the menu - Portuguese French restaurant in Canada! - Jose, the co owner offered to bring us a dish as an appetizer as we were hesitate to order as a main dish.  Omg!!!!!  It was outrageously delicious - presentation, the aroma, texture, taste all an absolute 10! Delicious! 
Kudo's to Miguel the chef and co owner who took the time to come out and greet us and the other tables.  
This is a small, quaint restaurant located in a little nondescript strip mall. A hidden gem.  
Two thumbs up.  Thank you for a memorable meal on our first evening in Canada."}

{"text":"Restaurant Viana Sol is AMAZING! I've been here about six times. Every time, I was waited on by co-owner José and my meal was expertly created by co-owner Miguel Almeida. The food is so good here, that I have  stopped ordering from the menu: I simply trust José and Miguel to make for me the most amazing culinary experience I've ever had. 

By the way, I've been to Portugal. The food here at Viana Sol is as fresh as, and even better than, the Portuguese food I had in Portugal. 

I'm from California, and I'm just blown away by the quality of the food and the service. Another thing: this restaurant is quiet and peaceful: it's good for a date, for good friends (and better wine), and family (including elderly family with hearing loss).

I cannot give them enough stars.  JUST GO!"}
