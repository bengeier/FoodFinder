{"text":"Thank God for EBN Vegan Cuisine. My wife and I are very busy during the week, and we have a very active Son. Hiring EBN Vegan Cuisine to help make our meals has been one of the best decisions we ever made, and the food is delicious. When I evaluated how much we were spending on eating out, I determine we could  afford it and actually save a little based on our past spend. But more importantly the food is so good. If you're thinking about transitioning to a Vegan diet Chef Shonda can help you. If you need help with meal prep Chef Shonda can help you as well. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hard to find. Don't give up .... it's on the backside. Just pull into the gravel parking lot and you'll see all the business doors. 

We ordered 1 breakfast platter, 1 nacho, 1 chicken teriyaki wrap with siracha on the side. 
Everyone enjoyed everything. The nacho's were nice. 
The wrap was big enough to enjoy 1 now and 1 later. 

We all surmised that bigger portions would have been had if we dined in. Only reason we didn't: the kid wanted pancakes. 

Weekend hours 10a - 2pm. 
Enjoy~

P.S. Very clean and gloves were utilized the entire time."}
