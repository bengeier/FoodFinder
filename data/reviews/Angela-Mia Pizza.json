{"text":"So far I've had their pizza, chicken parm, and their pasta.  The standard pasta is the least noteworthy; inoffensive, and a bit boring. the pizza is really very good.  The chicken parm was great. 

The most noteworthy thing about this place, though, is that if you take into account the prices, this is hands-down the best value I've ever encountered anywhere for prepared food.  the meal deals start at like $20, and really is enough food for at least 4 people!"}
{"text":"Best pizza value in Cleveland, hands down. Pizza is delicious and tasty, the chicken Parmesan is excellent, as are the pasta dishes. You can feed a hungry family of 4 for less than $20.

Service here has always been polite and reasonably quick. Prefer delivery because I honestly don't like driving through East Cleveland. Those cops are thirsty."}
{"text":"Much doesn't have to be said about Angela-Mia. Best pizza I've ever had, and I've had the best of NYC and Chicago. Simple as that."}
{"text":"worst service ever. This place used to be a favorite of mine until a recent unfriendly incident. After traveling all the way from the west side, i arrived at the door at 12:01, one minute after they closed. The door was locked so i called, and then i saw an employee in the back. I flagged her down to let her know that my order was already called in and she shouted 'we're closed.' Seriously, one minute after close? They would rather throw my food out (or take it home for themselves to eat) as opposed to accepting my money one minute after close? She already had her coat on,  I worked at a pizza place in high school, you stop accepting orders at close. Not allowing someone in one minute after close to ring up a 20 dollar pizza? I hope it was worth losing a customer forever Angela Mias. Horrible."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone thinks it's good at all, pizza was lousy and I didn't get half of my order- ghetto as can be and a total rip- off. Save your money and eat a pile of garbage instead of Angela Mia/ it's just plain rotten and gross- don't do it!"}
{"text":"This place is an E.C. staple. I loved it as a boy and someone had a pizza on Xmas eve and I had a slice. I decided to order for the fam and me. I took away one star because they got toppings on one of the pizzas wrong and the cut on the small pizza was terrible. Had I not been busy being such a fatty, I would have taken a picture. Even though the toppings were wrong, the pizza was still fantastic. Better than I remember. I got some buffalo wings. They weren't exactly crispy but they were good. The buffalo sauce was really good. It wasn't a perfect experience but it happens. I'll definitely make another visit. Service was great too!

Pro tip: If you get a dessert from there, skip the sweet potato pie. With one bite, you  can tell it's made with oil rather than butter. Not horrible but noticeably inferior to a pie made with real butter."}
{"text":"AngelaMia Deluxe was above par. Not your cookie cutter \"authentic\" frozen dough. Sauce slightly sweet and the flavor came through past the not-too-spicy italian sausage. Did the delivery, which arrived 65 minutes from time of order. Salad was good, fresh and not packaged. The delivery person was very nice. Ordered an apple cobbler, which I thought was slightly uncharacteristic for an italian restaurant.  The top of the container was dated 12.2.15. Today is the 13th. Either really old or frozen and reheated...didn't taste old. I would order again. Love that they have their own online ordering."}
{"text":"I have never been so happy to say I was glad Grovewood Tavern wasn't open for lunch.  There I was in the middle of Waterloo, by myself, ready to eat my arm from hunger.  A quick Yelp search turned up Angela Mia pizza and handful of glowing reviews.  Pizza.  Yep sounds good.  So.....this place is not in a sweet neighborhood AT ALL.  When was the last time you placed a pizza order behind a plexiglass window?  Exactly...you catch my drift.  Return in 30 minutes to pick up your pie.  And pick it up through a plexiglass window that is barely wide enough to accommodate a large pizza box.  This pizza knocked my socks off.  It is the closest to NYC pie I have tasted in years and it is flat out great.  The pizza is similar to Tasty Pizza in Lyndhurst but way better.  And the garlic roll was kickin', too.  I will go back for sure to get pizza from here but next time I won't go by myself and I may go armed in case some Jamoke tries to steal my pizza out of my arms before I get back to the car.  Kidding about being armed.  But seriously I would steal this pizza off someone.  Yeah, it's that good.  8 slice pizza with 3 toppings and a garlic roll $13.25."}
{"text":"So my husband and I decided we wanted to try Angela Mia's pizza because we're in Richmond Heights and there's a new one opened in town. We went on the website and only after we placed our order did we realize we ordered from the East Cleveland location. Our order came about 2 hours later, but it was a Saturday night so I expect they were busy. Phone service wasn't great, I was on hold for a while, but again, it's a busy Saturday night. However, once the pizza came, it's honestly so amazing. First the pizza had like a triple layer of pepperoni under the cheese. Then the garlic rolls have butter on both sides. I couldn't even tell where the lasagna began, it was so meaty and cheesy and saucy. The food is amazing. I would highly recommend this place and this location. I hope to try the Richmond Heights one next, but I am so glad we ended up with pizza from this location."}
{"text":"the pizza here is GREAT! it's flavorful but doesn't taste \"commercially\", like a lot of other popular pizza chains. it's not in the greatest neighborhood but it's definitely worth the drive and the wait, make sure you call aheeead of time because it takes about 45mins to just make a SMALL but again, it's so worth it. the only thing i didn't really like is the price, i would say it's pricey, i ordered a small pepperoni and sausage pizza and it was about $12 when i could get a large from surrounding chains for about the same price but as i keep saying, it's worth it lol."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to Angela Mia' Pizza.  Lots of fond memories from my teens. I miss the dining room.  I had the deluxe pizza minus the anchovies.  It lived up to my old memories of the best pizza in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Never again I ordered a pizza for my family on 8/09/16 i ordered a large pepperoni and sausage it cost me $ 17.50 and took a hour before my pizza was ready. My pizza was soggy and had no flavor i called back to complain and was met with disrespect was told they would do nothing to correct this never again will i waste almost $ 20.00 of my hard earned money at this dump management keep up the good it wont be long before you have -0- customers"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best pizza spots back in the day but the last couple of pizzas I got from them have been sub-par!!! Found out that the business was sold so it seems that the new management is cutting corners. Skimping on the cheese and toppings. Not worth the price anymore."}
{"text":"These people are rude as hell. I called to place an order they let the phone ring. Until they decided to pickup and hang up the call. Their pizza is good but it's definitely not worth that ignorance. It'll be a cold day in hell before I order from them.


Update: The next day I call around 7 pm they tell me \"We're no longer taking delivery orders\". I call today to see if I can order before delivery is finished. They girl I spoke with says \"we don't take delivery orders until 5:30-6pm\". Really!"}
{"text":"Good prices and comprehensive menu. Thin crust pizza was a bit bland, Buffalo wings nice and juicy and good spice, popcorn shrimp mice and crisp. Would go back."}
{"text":"Wow I'm blown away on why I waited so long to order from this place. 

I got delivery and they said it would be an hour n a half and I got kinda sad but 45 minutes later my door bell rang. Service was great, very friendly driver. 

I give 4 stars because I ordered Chicago Style and half of the pizza dough didn't rise or they didn't put enough or something. The sauce is amazing just a tad bit salty but man ooh man.... this pizza is good. Best sauce my hubby n I have had in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great local place great pizza, great spaghetti. They do Italian right. Delivery or pick up Angela Mia is worth the drive to EC."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to write this review without sounding like I either work for the place or own it.  This is hands down my favorite pizza.  I've been eating it for 27 years and it hasn't slipped in quality.  I've never had a bad experience here.
Thick crust pizza? Check
Regular crust? Check
Pasta? Check
Lasagna?  Double check
Hot sub? Check, Cold sub? Check
They keep expanding their menu to include more and more diverse dishes and normally this would spell doom for a restaurant.  Too many dishes is usually a sign of lean times but the place has never been busier.  The sauce is perfect, the portions are ridiculous and the family meal packs will feed an army - AND THEY'RE REALLY AFFORDABLE.
Warning: The food is great but if you want it fast - go to mcdonalds.  If you want to be coddled or pampered - go to Pier W.  But if you want some banging food at a fair price (not cheap but fair) go to Angela Mia.  Throw a dart at the menu if you want because there are no bad choices.  Oh yeah, and they're the only place in the hood that takes an AMEX without throwing a hissy fit"}
