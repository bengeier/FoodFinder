{"text":"Simple flavors that taste home made. Nothing special but it tasted fresh. There was tons of meat on the Turkey Sandwich and we left paying $25 for lunch which is pretty good for restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review of my favorite brunch spot ever, but I had such a bad experience last time I went in. The place was dead and we waited 25 minutes for our food. There were two of us. The chorizo was burnt and the portion was about a 1/4 smaller than normal. When we said something to a food server, he said that we needed to specially request it not be overcooked at time of ordering. And we could replace the meal next time when we first try it. Apparently we had ate too much of it. Really? Ask them ahead of time not to burn it? I love this place but this guy needs to go."}
{"text":"Everything is fabulous especially there monsoons!!! Also ther specials for the day are always really tasty! Love the coffee shop atmosphere as well"}
{"text":"a nice place for breakfast outside on a fall morning. Had the All America (it was Veterans Day) and really liked the bacon. Didnt get to try the baked goods."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop.  The coffee is good and my wife really likes their vanilla latte.  Their food is outstanding.  Yogurt with fruit and granola rocks!  They make their own granola and you can taste the difference.  Breakfasts are solid form their All American to their San Diegan.  Their waffles are great too! The wife loves their sandwiches.  Always fresh.  This place gets crowded and seating can be an issue. The staff is always nice and in a good mood.  Great local coffee option in a town where there is not enough good options."}
{"text":"I really like the breakfast items and the hot chocolate is good too.  The atmosphere is intimat and much like a coffee house.  The MOMS group meets there, so they could use more high chairs and a kids menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  But, I too was grossed out  by the flies crawling on all the pastries.  I have been in there 2 separate times to see if they had done anything about the flies -- nope.  I would love to try one of their award winning cupcakes but not while the flies have first dibs."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop I've been to in the Phoenix area.  I guess I'd call it more of a \"cafe\" since they serve (delicious) food in addition to their coffee.  The coffee itself is not as good as someplace like Cartel, but the atmosphere, wait staff, and food are superb.  Situated in the middle of an agricultural center, the grounds are kept very lush and green, which is a great reprieve from the desert-scape we're surrounded by.  It's my favorite place to come and read or get work done, and has been a fun place to meet new people.  On Saturdays and Sundays, especially in the morning, the place is packed and lively, generally with a \"younger\" crowd."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what really sells this place.  There's something about it that just feels kind of homey and inviting.  The outdoor patio is a great place to relax with some coffee and friends.  The indoor area is nice, too, because of the large windows that let in a lot of light.  However, if the place is full, especially if there are kids, it can get kind of loud.  I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed various iced coffee drinks.  The last time I went, I ordered food as well.  I had the Papas Grande which is scrambled eggs, cheese, potatoes, and bacon served inside a thin flour tortilla.  It also came with salsa which I asked for on the side, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not chunky and had just enough spice to make the meal interesting.  Not giving 5 stars just because of food service timing.  We waited quite a long time for our food and when the food finally came out, two of us were served while our third person had to wait even longer for his food - so long in fact, that the two of us that had food were almost halfway finished by the time the third dish was served.  Other than that hiccup, we enjoyed the food and the coffee.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome breakfast here this morning! Great food, busy atmosphere. Tippers beware however, you do most of your own service, stand in line to order, pick up your own drinks, clear your own plates and go find your own to go boxes, etc. No real sit down service to tip for except delivery of food. Food and drinks were really good, definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Just casual dining experience for the late nighters. Service was a bit slow but that's because they had a skeleton crew and it was 4 am in the morning. Wished they served Pho around the clock though. That would've earned them another star for a total of 4."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE! Vegan cupcakes to make anybody's taste buds smile :)"}
{"text":"I went there because they won cupcake wars, I honestly thought they were a cupcake and coffee shop.. no no.. they are soooo much more.  I fell in love with the place  The staff is so friendly, the cupcakes were divine (yes I said divine, nothing bad to say at all) the place is was clean and very urbanesque (I just made up a new word)the coffee was really good.  If they were not clear in Gilbert I'd go there often. They are next to Joe's which the lines are insane, but the hidden gem is The Coffee Shop."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place :) especially the fact we can ride our bikes here! The only downside is there is not a lot of indoor seating. The breakfast and coffee are great you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop, love the area, love the location, love the vibe and love that they have vegan options for food here !!!  My go to items are the iced teas, Americano and the cubano ( but be aware its like liquid crack, holymoly !!!) My son loves the mansoons here too !!!"}
{"text":"Lost 2 stars yesterday 6/17/17  1. way too many people occupying tables before ordering food. I ordered my food then had nowhere to sit - too hot outside. This is not the first time that's happened, it's a regular occurrence, but it was the first time it really interfered with my experience.  2. napkin dispenser and milk containers empty; I took the milk container up to the counter myself and waited for someone to notice me, but three servers were chatting - more senior person in the kitchen spotted me and had to interrupt their conversation to help me.  You guys serve great food in a cool atmos, but don't get sloppy. Pay attention to what's going on. Too many young kids working as servers who don't seem to care enough."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Phoenix!!!!!!!!!!!! The food quality is what separates the coffee shop from everyone else. The menu is simple, but the food is amazing! Try the all American breakfast which is what I get every Sunday. The potatoes are so good I asked the cook how he made them...he told me a really vague answer (I don't blame him), then he told me to just come back the next day and and he'll make me some more lol!"}
{"text":"Overrated pastries. Joes farm grillenid one of out favorite places so we decided to try these desserts that were supposed to be amazing. Simply disagree. Tasted dry and uninspired. Could Make better at home.  The coffee is good however as is the ambience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great coffee, good cup cakes, nice wi fi connection. Great place to relax and enjoy with the family or a friend."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! i had a hard time finding this place due to the trees covering its entrance, but it was worth it!   the service was friendly.   they had free wifi, but they have very limited outlets for laptop chargers. you can also sit outside and enjoy the quiet evening or inside where comfy chairs are provided for your pleasure. it's great for meeting with friends or a study session with your group.   it got kinda hot in there which was the downside to my visit, but other than that it was a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have only eaten here during the wee hours of the morning (think 5~6am) as an attempt to somewhat sober up before heading up to my room so I'm giving this place one more star than I normally would have.   What we've ordered:  **bacon, cheddar broccoli omelet - lots of ingredients, the bacon overload makes it slightly salty.. perhaps a little too salty **mushroom, swiss cheese omelet - i'd say this is your best bet if you're okay with mushrooms  **chicken fingers - steer clear, there's not much chicken in the chicken fingers, just really thick breading   Cons: Prices are steep for Denny's caliber food, about $14-15 for an omelet but portions are generous so they can be split (unless you're a lumber jack).  Bottom line: Would I ever eat here completely sober? No. Is this a good place to get your grub on after a night of crazy partying and drunken debauchery? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"I haven't had an opportunity to try the desserts yet, but breakfast was really good. I think I actually like more of the options than at Joe's Farm Grill.  Parking was tight (ended up in the dusty unpaved area), but the atmosphere and food was really great. I had a breakfast burrito and plan to return again!"}
{"text":"Great little fun place with awesome Atmosphere, great coffee, Danishes, and other real good things!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast/coffee stop in the East Valley! Love the atmosphere, and the outdoor option of letting the kiddos run around and play while we eat.  Don't pass up on their cupcakes... They're to die for!"}
{"text":"Eh it's ok, I was hungry needed coffee....it did the job. Hollandaise sauce tasted a bit off, pancakes were good though but I wouldn't come back, Denny's food is probably better."}
{"text":"We walk here as a family of 5 EVERY SATURDAY (literally) and usually hit it once or twice more during the week for a coffee or tea. Easily the best breakfast place in the east valley. The pastries are unreal, all freshly baked. They have vegan and dairy free options all over the place. The owners didn't win the show \"Cupcake Wars\" for nothing. The baked goods really are over-the-top good. I go with the TJ open face omelet, no dairy typically and I'm never disappointed. My wife likes the Papas Grande burrito and our three kids usually devour the chorizo breakfast burrito. Very unique vibe, tons if outdoor seating, and fantastically fresh, organic coffee. Just go here and you'll be hooked...and we will see each other on Saturday's!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the cupcakes here, but they are so incredibly good! Especially the mixed berry and cherry cupcakes...beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"Just a quick coffee rant now that I'm all jacked up on caffeine....the drink \"Cubano\" may be just a tad misleading, just a tad. So please be patient with someone when they ask if it is indeed Cuban coffee. Please don't get a slight hint of attitude, someone could easily think just by the name alone they would be getting actual Cuban coffee that they adore and not just 2 shot of espresso. Other than that, it is adorable in there! Time to go chase squirrels."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Agritopia in Gilbert, you'll love this cute place. With the most delicious cupcakes you'll EVER taste (winner of Food Network Cupcake Wars!), and a vast assortment of healthy, fresh menu items, this is the place to be! Free wi-fi and great garden view! Located next to Joe's Farm Grill and very affordable. You'll feel like you've spent the day in the countryside as you sip coffee, browse the web, chat with locals, munch on delectable sandwiches and enjoy a relaxing outing!"}
{"text":"Been there twice now, once was late evening and the other mid afternoon. I had a chicken salad and the tomato Florentine soup, both were delicious. I had the nachos on the second visit and I liked them as well. No problems with service that others have mentioned. My husband got the baked chicken, however, and it was lukewarm and served with cauliflower that was quite awful. Too bad, I would have given four stars on my choices."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat probably ever! Best sandwiches! Best pastries! The birthday cake whoopie is to die for and the cupcakes are the best I've had. And of course the chicken and honey mustard sandwich! It has fresh mozzarella and thick carved chicken! Amaze balls!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast burritos and a nice place to hang out. Slow service, though: I'll usually get my food long before getting my coffee. Even when it's not busy, it takes much longer than it should to get a drink made."}
{"text":"I love me some fresh farm food! This place is soooo good! The coffee is legit & surprisingly fairly priced. I got the San Diegan which was so good! Add avocado if you want to take it to the next level. Also tried the blueberry white chocolate chip coffee bread! So delicious!! The only thing about this place that wasn't so stellar was that it was packed inside so we had to sit outdoors....in the heat...with no fan or misters....it was almost unbearable"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning at 9:00.  It was busy, but there were still tables available.  By 9:30 there didn't seem to be any tables left and was a long line to order.  I sat outside, it's peaceful and tranquil out there.  I ordered a medium cafe mocha and the Papas Grande breakfast burrito.  It was huge and very delicious!  The coffee was made quickly and the burrito took no longer than 10 minutes and was brought out to me.  Service was friendly and quick.  Next time I'll have to try the cupcakes as they are supposed to be the best cupcakes around!"}
{"text":"This place is actually a cafe with a good selection of breakfast and lunch sandwiches (really good) and breakfast burritos (huge but I haven't tried them yet). Pretty fun atmosphere and fast Wi-Fi so I usually sit down and work a couple hours.  Minus one star for the plague of flies in that area. There are often 3-4 aggressive flies buzzing around the place. If they could get rid of the flies somehow (lasers perhaps) it would be a favorite place of mine."}
{"text":"Super chic cafe, the mocha chip monsoon is so good!! Also it's on a farm so it's really fun to walk around! I went on a Saturday morning so it was pretty crowded."}
{"text":"First let me start out by letting you, the reader, know my qualifications and why i never write review on servers or service professionals.  I have owned my own business and managed others.  I have worked in the food industry many times over the years. Both as a bartender and waiter.  I have plenty of certifications to do other things but my current job is wonderful and it's why I love being a waiter now at this point in my life.  We serve 25-35 people all at once during a 2 hr window prior to a show at one of the top fine dining dinner theaters in the world.  I've also waited tables at quick dining and fine dining  restaurants where people come in and eat and they leave.  Which is why I understand the issues behind dealing with shitty customers who don't tip, are obnoxious, unrealistic, bitchy, demanding, and downright rude mother fracking cheapskates. 18-20% people. That's what you need to tip.  Waiters remember the assholes they serve. If you don't tip they remember you and trust waiters give a shit who you are when you come in every time every day or once a year.  We always remember.  And don't give us a damn religious pamphlet because you're cheap and WONT tip. (Not cant but WONT). ----------- Now.  I sat at THE COFFEE SHOP/PHO RESTAURANT for 15 minutes before I was asked for something to drink.  Then it took the waiter another 20 minutes, (yes) I watched my phone timer, to come up to my table, open his book and stand there without saying anything as if I'm supposed to read his mind so I just started giving him my order and then he simply walked away.  It took another 25 minutes for the food.  The place is worn out, the booths are hard as a rock and the cushions on both booths I tried out were so bad the springs could be felt when sitting.  At least I hope it was that or it was a dead animal.  ----------- It made me itch just being there.  The walls and ledges are dusty and dirty they look like they get cleaned about 2x a Month.  ---------- The food is amazing.  Huge portions.  The Chicken Pho soup is fantastic.  Great portions of chicken, noodles and pea pods.  The Club sandwich is absolutely the biggest club and fry platter I've ever seen.  Amazing turkey and tomato and bacon flavor.  Unbelievable.  Love the food.  But the staff... The staff is unfriendly, unhappy, rude, not welcoming, and they DO NOT SMILE.  There is NO WAY I would EVER allow anyone to work the floor  if they can't even smile and act as if I'm the first table of their day and I happen to be their best friend.  These people all over the casino need a lesson in customer service.  Treat us like gold or you'll lose a lot of money.  Food-fabulous, 4 stars.  Staff in restaurants. Rude. Staff in shops and pool area. Super friendly and fabulous.  I'd love to help and do more to change this because I love this Hotel and would love to call it home someday.  It's just too dry in Vegas for me to live there right now.  Maybe one day."}
{"text":"I had the pastrami sandwich, it was very good. Actual slices of thick pastrami. It had sauerkraut and horseradish sauce, tasted so good. It is super busy, so go early for lunch. Great place during the the winter months to sit outside."}
{"text":"Best local coffee shop in town! When I go there I order the vegan taco wrap and it is so delicious! The staff is super friendly and helpful! I come here on the regular and I have yet to have a bad experience! Anytime that I need to have a coffee date or work this is the place I go!"}
{"text":"Service is always so dang slow here. Food is pretty good yet overpriced. I think I keep coming back out of convenience and the nice outdoor seating area"}
{"text":"Ich kann mich den anderen Bewertungen nicht anschließen!!! Wir waren hier während unseres Aufenthaltes zum Frühstück und vietnamesischen Abendessen. Wir haben immer sofort einen Platz bekommen, die Bedienung war immer freundlich, verstand auch einen Spaß, dass Essen kam zügig. Alles schmeckte gut und wer günstigere Preise direkt in einem Hotel am Strip erwartet, kann ja mal die Umgebung abklappern, ob er fündig wird. Von uns gibt es 4 Sterne."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is the BEST!  AMAZING food, service, and ambiance.  Our family and friends always love every visit, and can't get enough of this little escape!  Everyone can find something to enjoy, and everything has a rare personal touch. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I love vermicelli but there was too much going on in their menu. I got some spring rolls and the peanut sauce was really watered down and the fried spring rolls in my vermicelli tasted bad. My wife got a turkey sandwich and they put no mayo or cheese or flavor for that matter. They should probably cut down on their menu and focus on making a couple of things really good instead of making allot of things  really shitty."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little coffee shop. They use fresh and local ingredients. Besides serving some delicious breakfast foods and lunch sandwiches, they also have a nice and tasty selection of cupcakes and baked goods. Oh, and I can't forget their blended Monsoon coffee drinks. Couldn't get a enough of them. Came back here for 3 days straight to try out new items during my recent visit to Gilbert."}
{"text":"One of our very favorite spots! The Papas Grande burrito is incredible. Amazing pastries as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast here twice while staying at TI and haven't been disappointed. You get full and if you add some salt and pepper to your entree it's pretty tasty.  Service was good and the food came quick.  Typical breakfast for 2 including juice or coffee ran about $55 with tip, which is pretty steep.  I'm not kicking myself - my company paid for it!"}
{"text":"Gilbert is cool.  Yeah, that's right, I said it.  Gilbert is the coolest town in the valley and this is one of the places that makes it so darn cool.  The atmosphere here is perfect for hanging out and relaxing with a hot cup of coffee or, better still, a cup of cowboy cocoa.  Be sure to also check out the restaurant next door, Joe's Farm Grill.  Another amazingly cool place to hang out and enjoy great comfort food in a friendly setting."}
{"text":"Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast on a Sunday morning. We expected it to be busy, but we didn't expect such a long wait as we'd been there before on a Sunday morning and the wait wasn't excessive. We ordered to-go and waited almost an hour, standing up, for our food. We finally got it and went home ready to eat. We sit down full of anticipation and starvation. My boyfriend opens his to-go box and finds a weird little brown oval thing. I thought it was a coffee bean at first, or some food piece of some sort. He did a quick search for \"cockroach egg\" and what-do-you-know it's an exact match. Now I'm sitting here, still hungry, but not wanting to even open my box.  Won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"Food and desserts are great. Have been disappointed the last few times with getting coffee. The drinks have been mostly milk and very sugary. Will go back for sure but only for the food"}
{"text":"Heard that their breakfast burritos were amazing so we went there for one. We ordered 2 of them but the cashier said they were out of tortillas so we settled for something else. Not even 5 minutes after receiving our food the table next to us got delivered 2 breakfast burritos. Pretty upsetting I doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"Since I'm a visitor to Arizona, I always ask my sister in law for recommendations to awesome finds. So when I asked her for a quaint eatery, she recommended the coffee shop for it's food, coffee, and atmosphere.  Upon arrival, I was very impressed with it's greenery and ambiance. Their pastry display, variety of lattes, frozen drinks, and meals were very impressive. I decided upon their pumpkin spice latte (I know it's August but it's my favorite flavor) with a chocolate chip coffee cake as a starter; both were equally impressive. When my friend arrived, we ordered breakfast: I ordered the San Dieagan (open face omelette) and she ordered a chorizo burrito (I think it's meant for two people or someone with a big appetite). We both concluded that this was a great find. Their prices were reasonable, location was great (I loved the drive from Mesa to Gilbert), and I'm absolutely looking forward to another visit when I'm back in town.  P. S. If you go on the weekends, go early and save a table. We noticed groups came in waves and dominated areas of the shop. Although the atmosphere shifted slightly from chill to kinda hectic, the staff remained upbeat and hospitable."}
{"text":"I love this place! Green tea with mango is absolutely fantastic! Great cupcakes and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great coffee, cupcakes, & whoopies! Love to grab a treat and sit outside on their patio."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast on a Friday morning.  The service was TERRIBLE.  We only waited a few minutes to be seated, but getting someone to come and take our order took almost twenty minutes.  Water refills took forever as well.  When the restaurant is full of empty tables this shouldn't happen!  The food was standard breakfast fare, and the quality was decent.  However, with two entrees and coffees, the tab was over $50.  I expected as much for Vegas, but if I'm paying that much for food I could get anywhere, it would be nice if the service was top-notch."}
{"text":"Didnt make it to breakfast. Had pesto chicken sandwich. Had high expectations, the garden was nice. I honestly didnt see what everyone else was talking about. Maybe I was just having an off day. Although, I think over priced, I will return. Cupcakes were hypnotizing!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do. We're fans of Joe's Farm Grill (only for takeout, though--too crowded and touristy otherwise), and this is on the same property. We can walk there from our house, which is great on a crisp winter morning.   The spot is very cute, love the decor and the patio, but would it kill the staff to SMILE once in a while? Everyone looks so miserable and/or angry. You can't get them to smile if you tried.   Now the food. Don't bother. I've given it a couple of tries and it's just impressive. Today I tried the veggie scramble. The menu didn't say it had cheese on it, and I would have asked to nix it if I'd known. But it came out with a big pile of shredded cheese on top. Ok, fine, not what I wanted, but if you are going to do it, you couldn't put it under the broiler for like 30 seconds to melt it and heat it? Lazy. The flavor was NIL. Zero. Like eating cardboard. No salt, no pepper, no herbs or spices of any sort. And just thrown on the plate. You eat with your eyes first. Fail. Then you expect to have flavor. Fail. And for it to be hot. Fail. I added hot sauce and salt and it was fine, but not worth buying. My daughter had a hot chocolate that was lukewarm at best, and clearly Swiss Miss from an envelope. Another waste of money.  The cupcakes? Yawn. Overpriced for small cupcakes that are dry and crusty. They're pretty and well decorated, but not much beyond that.   Sorry to be so harsh, but I'm done giving this place a shot. I might be more inclined to go back just for a cup of coffee once in a while, but the staff's attitude has made that impossible too. I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I thought I'd sneak in here on a weekday, grab my stuff and go. But no, the line was as long on the weekday as it is on the weekend.  This place is the best and totally worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious cupcakes!! Reasonably priced, very nice place. Nice and friendly staff, quick and clean. Red velvet and coconut cupcakes are amazing! Yummy vanilla iced late."}
{"text":"Today was my first trip to The Coffee Shoppe as a new mom, meeting another new mom there who had never been. To say we were excited to be out of the house would be an understatement! After raving about how amazing this place was (the waffle and coffee were amazing btw), I had to go to the restroom for an unexpected diaper change. MAJOR FAIL...no changing tables??? Seriously, I was shocked! To me, Agritopia is a neighborhood and should be family friendly. I really hope you get with the program and add a changing table so next time I don't have to put my baby on the floor!!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is great if you're a vegan living in Gilbert. Their vegan cupcakes are good, but a little pricey. However, their vegan taco wrap is just awesome! It's typically packed on the weekends so be sure to plan accordingly. During the week, it's a great place to study and you can usually find a seat. Maybe they could expand the back porch and put fans in or A/C? Also, when its busy, you have to be sure to keep an eye on your drink order as it may disappear. The employees are always nice! For a local spot in Gilbert, its pretty neat hangout!"}
{"text":"Located right next to Joe's Farm Grill, this little cafe is as quaint and as charming as the rest of the Agritopia community. Posted up in a small wooden house, The Coffee Shop is home to Cupcake Wars winners and rightfully so. I ordered a Pink Glam and my friend got a Devils Food Cake cupcake, both were washed down with some very delightful iced coffee with vanilla. Never have I seen such nice wait staff at a cafe, these gals were so pleasant.  The cupcakes were not your average cupcake either.Instead of one heaping lump of icing on top, frosting was swirled into 5-6 petals and dolloped on top and sprinkled with glitter on some. My cupcake was fit for a Barbie.  The Coffee Shop had plenty of seating perfect for a solo wifi user, afternoon coffee date or a group of people gathering to catch up and enjoy a great lunch. We choose the outdoor seating which had a beautiful wooden canopy with vines and flowers.   Everything was so picture-esque and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a unique and cozy place, this is it.  I love this place for it's atmosphere. The cupcakes are delicious and vegan. The only thing is they are little pricey."}
{"text":"Obviously the cupcakes are famous- but I come here for coffee and a quick bite to eat if I want to enjoy the trees and shade. The building used to be a post office, and now it is surrounded by farming, and different types of flora and fauna. I enjoyed a spinach, feta, and tomato omelette the last time I visited. Tasted fresh. There really is a difference in taste when you buy local, compared to an omelette at Denny's. The coffee shop has good coffee, but you can expect prices a little higher than Starbucks. Most of the desserts are delicious. I still haven't tried a cupcake, but that's because I don't care for sparkly cupcakes... Just not my thing."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy.  They serve lunch type foods too which are pretty good, but it's the cupcakes and atmosphere that you need to go for!  I took my friend the other day and she doesn't even like cake, and hates frosting and she devoured two cupcakes!  Only real complaint is the parking which is insanely tight in front, my friend parked in back though and said it was fine so I guess I need to start parking there."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money. Terrible service. We had 3 orders of toast and they gave them on one plate. Waitress was so rude and did not provide any service what so ever."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite coffee shop.  I love coffee, all things coffee and I could be in a coffee shop all day if I could.  It is cozy, intimate, the owners are very friendly and inviting.  You don't feel rushed if you take your time there reading a book or blog away on your laptop.  The muffins here are simply divine and addicting.  The cran-orange muffin is SOOOOOO moist and prefectly sweet and tart, it's totally worth a few extra inches around the waist.  Something about the head Chef (Jean I believe is her name) dressing up in her professional chef garb is so cool.  I don't care for their plain coffee as much but their lattes and espresso drinks are well made.  They can do whatever you want...bring on the 16 worded drinks you order at starbucks and they can make it for you sans \"tall, grande and venti\" of course.  Great breakfast on weekends and the fruit plate lives up to is $5 charge.  Love this place and so glad we have such a eclectic coffee shop amongst all the chains that have dominated the east valley."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere with amazing cupcakes! I first tried their cupcakes at The Nordstrom Cafe probably 8 years ago! So sad they no longer carry them but the coffee shop is now closer to our new home!"}
{"text":"The show \"Cupcake Wars\" has lost all credibility with me!  Perhaps today was an \"off\" day for the Coffee Shop, or perhaps the judges on the show just have bad taste, but I find it hard to believe this place won $10,000 for their cupcakes!  After seeing this place on tv, we were in the area today and decided to stop in.  The staff wasn't bad, but not good either, and they seem to be bothered and annoyed by customers, rather than grateful we are keeping them in a job!  On our visit today, there were about 7 or 8 flavors to choose from (however, as a chocoholic, I was disappointed there was only chocolate coconut and a not really chocolate, cookie dough cupcake!).  We decided to try a few out, since none of the flavors were really that enticing.  We got Vanilla Glam, which seemed to be vanilla cupcake with cherry frosting, Lemon Glam, Lemon Raspberry and the Cookie Dough.  All of them were very, very disappointing, borderline gross!  The frostings, with the exception of the Lemon Raspberry, were ok but a bit on the sweet side and way too much artificial flavoring and coloring.  The Lemon Raspberry however was grainy and had a very bad after taste.  The cupcakes themselves however were awful!  They had a very heavy, dense texture,  and they were pretty dry to boot!  And for 4 different flavors, they all had a very similiar taste, the very slight exception being the Raspberry had 2 small bits and the cookie dough with had 2 tiny bits of \"chocolate\".  I'm not sure what they used for chocolate but it tasted cheap and artifical, and not at all like a chocolate chip.  The cupcakes were bad enough as it was, but then the added sting of $12.85 for 4 of them made it even worse.  I will stick with homemade or grocery store cupcakes!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Just make sure you understand there is limited parking.  But if you love good coffee and a cool atmosphere to hang out, this is the place.  They also have a great menu for food."}
{"text":"Ok, I broke down n decided to go spend over $3 ea for a cup cake, one vegan (double chocolate) n a cherry ..it was good, but nothing to go back to."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoy this place. Setting of location is beautiful. Beverages and food are all super tasty. Free wifi. Favorite new place!!"}
{"text":"they have horrible service! it took really long to get our food... we came to eat here because it was the only thing open at our hotel at 4am lol..but anywhoo there wasnt alot of people ...how long does it really take to make a grilled cheese sandwich?? and to top it off the food wasnt that great!."}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with chris, but this place has the best coffee in town. Always fresh, robust and flavorful. Great bakery items. I've tried the boston cream cupcake - excellent, and the chocolate chip cookie sandwich - chocolate lovers dream come true.  A bit pricey for a sandwich. The breakfasts are big and delicious."}
{"text":"I have always loved The Coffee Shop, although I think they are overpriced.  I would come here more often if they were a bit more reasonable. Today I purchased 4 cupcakes (Birthday, Choc.Chip, Vanilla Glam & Banana Split).  Yes they were good... but not to die for like most are saying. Come on people, they were NOT worth the $3+. No way, no how. Could they be any smaller? Felt ripped off really.  They won the Cupcake Wars?  They were tasty, but I expected way, way more.   I have tasted better from AJ's Finer Foods and got more bang for my buck. I would put the price at $1.50 each max.  All the Cupcake Wars hype is what is pricing those things. Make them larger for the $3+ and then you are fair.  I'm not denying they were fun, flavorful and pretty, but I will def. warn people about the $$ and size.  Sorry.  I do like The Coffee Shop, but the cupcakes are hardly worth it.  Will I return, yes... for good coffee and good sandwiches only."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome for breakfast - great coffees, coffee cakes and burritos and open faced fritattas. Or enjoy a fantastic sandwich at lunch and by the way, these guys rocked Cupcake Wars when Cupcake Wars was cool. Great laid back vibe, great food, great people."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good!! Love their chai tea latte!!! Best I've ever had! We go all the time. Breakfast is awesome and every coffee drink is amazing!"}
{"text":"My favorite local place for espresso, breakfast with friends, or a lunch date with my sweetie and pooch (porch is dog friendly).  My favorite coffee drink is their Scotch Kiss Latte and my second favorite is the Caramel Macchiato.  Their cupcakes are also a fun treat!  We really like their Red Velvet.  Great place and very friendly!"}
{"text":"I stopped coming here after all the flies and unruly children but since it has been about a year, came back to see what may have changed.  Still has flies, children running between the tables, and it looks like there must be a discount if you bring a large stroller to take up what is left of the space between the tables.   Don't get me wrong, there are some quiet patrons here having lunch or whatnot and a few older children who remain in their seats but just a few.  I can't imagine getting any laptop work done at all in this place let alone read a book or study. Food:   It is nice that they bring it to the table, may take a while.  Nothing spectacular, a little pricey.   Cupcakes:  fly-ridden.  Cake part is not much to brag about, the flavor comes from the thick icing.  They look very pretty.  Have tried my fair share and still just meh. Ambiance:  nice patio, loud indoors and out.  A little quieter on the couches but not much. Service:  why is there always a line extending the length of the building, even if it is only three people ahead of you?  Really, you can stand closer than a car length to the  next person.  This is Gilbert, after all. Parking:  goodluck.  Don't even bother on a weekend. Overall:  if you want a place to let your toddlers run free then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Ordered a caramel macchiato and a bagel. I have to say this is the absolute best bagel I have ever had. It didn't look like anything special but 1 bite told me this was not store bought.  It was soft and fluffy almost like a croissant.  It did take around 10 minutes to get the bagel but after tasting it I didn't mind. The staff was courteous and polite. I will definitely be bringing my friends here."}
{"text":"Located in Treasure Island, and is opened 24 hours a day, is this American Diner Theme Eatery place. It's convenient diner food, which is all that is remarkable about this facility.   The service could be better, it was slow during my visit. The dining hall is dead on 0630 on a Tuesday morning, and it took us at least 15 minutes to get our place mats, additional flatware, and water? And then another 15 minutes to get our meals? Some how I think the staff needs caffeine injections.   Food is ok, it's swimming with the heavy use of butter on everything. It's a diner place after all - don't expect anything healthy from here. Just fill you up and then rush to a tradeshow."}
{"text":"Mediterranean scramble is the perfect gluten free brunch. Baby lettuce was fresh with a tasty light dressing. Took a star off for delayed mocha arrival and lack of coordination between barista and kitchen. Delightful patio. Pet friendly (unless your dog hates the resident cats!) located adjacent to Wednesday 4-8 pm Agritopia farmers market. Locals and locavores gather here."}
{"text":"The cupcakes are better than Sprinkles, it's not too dense and not too fluffy. Something about the cream cheese frosting feels like bliss. The vanilla cupcake is my favorite, such a delight! Why did you stop putting glitter on them? Oh, and try to keep the flies out of the case."}
{"text":"I stopped in here before a meeting to grab something to eat with my husband. We love the concept and the design is wonderful. The cupcakes look great but the vanilla one I had was awful. The frosting was made of cream cheese (they should have mentioned this somehow) and was a gorgeous sparkly pink. It had been in the fridge and was hard and stale and tasted like it hadn't been made with cake flour but all purpose, heavy and gluey flour.    My husband got the cobb wrap and it was sweet and he didn't care for it. I got an egg salad on a croissant, and the best thing about my lunch was the Frito's they added to the plate. They put in all kinds of stuff in the egg salad (were those dates?) and  I regretfully had to throw it away, along with my cupcake.  The cupcakes look great, but save yourself the trouble, and don't."}
{"text":"To say the food is bland here is a complete understatement, Seriously, how can you have a cheeseburger with absolutely no flavor?  Went there last night before seeing a show. My daughter and myself ordered cheeseburgers, and my wife got the pho.   A cheeseburger with the works (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions) should have some kind of taste, but nothing! I took a bite, and couldn't taste anything at all. My daughter said the same thing about hers, too.  My wife said the pho was okay, but she loves that watery crap, no matter how it tastes. They didn't seem very busy, but the service was really slow. Also, they charged an additional $1.50 for a little side order of ranch dressing for the fries....seems slightly outrageous for a couple ounces of salad dressing.  Needless to say, not going back."}
{"text":"I vaguely remember trying to find this place in a drunken frenzy in the wee hours of the morning after a ridiculous night of drinking. Sadly, the alcohol got the best of us and we failed to find it. HOWEVER, we were still craving it the next day and sobriety was on our side and we found it! I had the eggs benedict, but instead of your ol' run of the mill benedict w/canadian bacon...it had filet mignon! OMG. Heaven in my mouth. Really. Enough said."}
{"text":"The hostess Katheryn was a total fucken rude bitch! She has a bad attitude and a problem with her eyes since she kept rolling them. The food was good but the bad vibes from the hostess made this a bad experience. Hopefully next time she'll have a better attitude and make this a more pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite some time as it was the only coffee shop in this area.  The atmosphere is AMAZING!   It is located in Agritopia next to Joe's Farm Grill and the gardens and orchards of Agritopia.  The surroundings are very calming and serene, especially for Phoenix.  The patio is very nice with shaded areas and tables with umbrellas, there is a lot of seating available outdoors for when the weather is nice enough and also inside seating is adequate. The music is luck of the draw.  We are here sometimes when the music is more main stream and it is good, but depending on who is working, you make get the worst mix of music you can imagine.  There have literally been times when the music was so depressing and electronically mind numbing that I have had to get up and leave or try to find some ear plugs.  I am not talking about standard coffee shop music either!  I have definitely had times when I needed to plug into my own tunes when I am there alone.  As far as being there with someone you are trying to converse with and not having the option to close off from the music it is all I can do to just try to tune it out.  Now for the coffee and food portion of the review.  The coffee is very average, in fact the it is luck of the draw also as to if the espresso drinks are going to be bitter and burnt.  Most of the barista's have had little to no training and are just guessing at correct method on pulling the espresso.  I have had a couple who obviously knew more about it and can make a great espresso, but unfortunately, that is not usually the case.  So as far as the coffee portion of this place, I would give a huge thumbs down.    The food on the other hand is quite good.  I have had many items from both the breakfast menu and the lunch menu and I am always happy with the food.  Most of the prices are in-line with similar restaurants, but a few things are a little pricey in my opinion.  My favorite item on the menu, along with many others is the Santa Fe, and the Friday Fish Tacos.  The baked items are very good, with the exception of the cupcakes.  Don't get me wrong, they are still good, in fact very good flavors and choices.  Also the cupcakes are far superior to most of the ones I have tried from the local cupcake shops!  Occasionally they are not as fresh as I would like.  When they are fresh they are superior to most that I have had.  They have real flavor in both the cupcake and the icing, where I think some cupcake stores rely on the flavor of the frosting carrying the cupcakes.  Bottom line is if you are a true coffee connoisseur, and you are looking for a good coffee drink, this place is a no good!  If you are looking for atmosphere, good food, and average coffee, then this is your place.  Good luck with the luck of the draw on both the barrista and the music choice of the moment."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a relaxed environment. Not a lot of seating for the big crowd that was there but not a huge deal. I got the mocha malt and it was very delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have vegan options!! Thank you, Coffee Shop for including some vegan options in your menu. The tofu Benedict was so delish! I also had the Oreo vegan cupcake (super yummy). I will be coming back to enjoy your delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, greasy cupcakes. Good coffee, crappy customer service."}
{"text":"Just went to the Coffee Shop for the first time and it was ok. The chai tea was better than I thought it would be and the waffle was fine. It wasn't great but it wasn't terrible. My boyfriend got the papa burrito and he said he really liked it. We also got a side of potatoes and they were horrible. They were incredibly dry and overly seasoned .I even tried dipping them in salsa but they were still too dry, that was a little disappointing. We sat outside and there were alot of cute stray cats that came up and we got to pet them:)"}
{"text":"I take my friends and family here when I want to show them the best of Gilbert. Really a gem. Back patio surrounded with roses, and Indio breakfast sandwich is delicious. Large portion so hubby & I share it. Highly recommend for families and couples. Can also go for a stroll in the community garden after breakfast."}
{"text":"If I was reviewing only the sandwiches here I'd give them a 5 star review! The sandwiches here are the best. They make them with super fresh, the breads are great, and they simply put together great combinations of ingredients. You cannot go wrong with the sandwich option. The pastries are also fantastic! Everything from the scones to muffins are delicious!   Unfortunately, the breakfast burritos and coffee are just mediocre (ironic when it is called the coffee shop).  My recommendation is to come here for lunch. It is a wonderful spot for lunchtime!"}
{"text":"12.15pm Visited the Coffee Shop based at Treasure Island for a light lunch.  Service    Server very and friendly however on seeing my almost full plate of the left over food she did not question as to why or ask if I wanted something else. My thoughts were perhaps  she was used to people leaving full plates of food which is very worrying and disgraceful for a coffee place/restaurant in a hotel.  Food  Ordered the Qusedillas which came with Pico De Gio and Sour Cream.  I asked for no sour cream. When It arrived it was poorly plated, soggy and tasteless. It was not at all crispy or fresh tasting. The chicken was hard to find and what was in it was stringy and there was lots of onions and what i thought might be stringy green pepper stuck on the cheese. Quite frankly the worse ever one I have tasted anywhere and considering i was starving this tells you a lot."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! It is super clean and the staff is friendly! I had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast sandwich that both were outstanding. The inside seating area is limited but I love all the windows that let in great light. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We stopped bothering going on weekends due to the mass crowds that fill this quaint spot.  I wished they would add more tables inside, maybe even expand! It's def a local favorite.  During the week is nice though no problems w finding tables"}
{"text":"I just moved here around the area and some friends came to visit me from out of town, so we all decided to get breakfast! We had such a good time here! The food was delicious, the tunes were awesome, and our drinks were great too! Thanks for such an awesome memory!!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit and talk with your friends. I wish their coffee was good as McDonald's......."}
{"text":"Mushroom omelette and crispy hashbrowns. The service was prompt and delightful...especially the attentive Keno girl. Gotta love winning money over eggs and toast. If you stay at treasure island and want a quick breakfast without leaving the casino, I recommend the coffee shop."}
{"text":"This is my local coffee shop but not just for the coffee. They make great cup cakes & the breakfast is simple but awesome. Plus they have free wifi!  Small town meets big city with a laid back family feel very cool."}
{"text":"Standard diner with easy access. Good size portions, but a little overpriced. Omelettes are all priced over $18."}
{"text":"Si mangia discretamente l'hamburger è buono ma non è sicuramente il migliore che io abbia mangiato negli Stati Uniti .  You eat the burger is fairly good but definitely not the best I've eaten in the United States"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service is god awful. We stayed at Treasure Island for my bachelorette party and every staff member at the hotel was phenomenal but we ate twice at the coffee shop due to its convenience and the waitresses there are horrendous. Nohemi was beyond rude to us. She took over 15 minutes to even greet us and get us beverages. Was snotty when we asked for ketchup and pepper. And took forever to get our checks and never brought to go boxes when we asked. When she brought our checks back, she had given us someone else's card and my friends was missing!! Duane was not our server and he was very nice and helping us a lot, he got us the boxes and stuff we asked to let him have the tip not her! Don't sit with Nohemi, her manager should be ashamed he hired her!!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best! I had dinner as well as breakfast, it was awful. The bread was stale on the burger. The breakfast eggs taste like powder eggs and food was just not appealing physically either. People were nice, service was fast."}
{"text":"A regular stop for me thanks to the coffee and consistently good food. The burritos are my usual go to dish, although I always ask for my tortilla grilled. I've learned that without that small request you risk getting a slightly raw tortilla. Note to the cooks: the tortilla, a Mexican staple, is useless (some would say blasphemous) without that slight char on each side.  For lunch, the veggie sandwich is a favorite of mine thanks to a generous portion of veggies, the pesto mayo, and fresh mozzarella cheese."}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is that they are open 24 hours. The best time to go is breakfast, rather than late night. We went late night and it took about 40 minutes to get our meal. The prices are ridiculously high, but it's super convenient for people staying at TI."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops I've ever been to. The outdoor sitting area is splendid. Birds everywhere, and a beautiful little garden area to look at. It's absolutely lovely. Tried their cinnamon roll cupcake and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent coffee shop around Mesa to do some studying and unfortunely still have not found it in The Coffee Shop. The store is trendy and spacious but came off as more of a sit down and eat cafe rather than a study place. First off there are no outlets in the main dining room so you have to go to a fairly dark room in the back to find outlets. Instead of tables though, it's filled with sofas so it's even harder to stay awake. The wifi is fairly choppy too so it kicks you off every so often, with a big suggestion that they don't recommend you staying on for more than 2 hours.   But if you're not looking for a place to study, the coffee shop is good for chit chat and food. There is plenty of room to sit, talk and catch up with friends. There is also a nice patio outside.  I ordered a vanilla cupcake after hearing that they were on cupcake wars back in 2010. The frosting was sweet and creamy. My only complaint was that the interior seemed a bit dry. It's a fairly big cupcake for $3 though, perfect for sharing.  I would return again to try out all the delicious items I saw on the menu and just catch up with friends on the nice patio outside. However studying for a long period of time is probably not a good idea here."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is a nice spot to relax and have a hot drink. Weekends are a bit hectic but the food is great across from Joes farm grill but still get a lot of crowds. I usually get the Papas Grande burrito and the TCS Waffle. Never fails they are great every time. The hot chia tea is amazing.  The garden around the place is nice as well if you want to walk around and relax with your latte."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to spend time.  Large coffee shop with seating inside and out, free wifi so I can study or get some work done.  Drinks are good and like the rest of the menu on the high end price-wise without being ridiculous.  This place has been featured on Food Network for their cupcakes and they are indeed delicious.  The menu ranges from breakfast items like burritos and omelets to sandwiches at lunch.  It's usually busy but not chaotic and even the occasional longish lines go fairly quickly."}
{"text":"I really liked this place but goodness the wait! It's a great place to like hang out at on a Sunday morning with your friends to just sip on some coffee and catch up. You'll need the friends tho to forget about how long you're waiting. In other words, don't go alone ha! Or while in a rush. It's a nice place to grab some coffee while taking your kid or dog on a stroll too"}
{"text":"We love this place but have been disappointed the last couple of times we've been here. The last time we were ordering some baked goods, one of the employees was cleaning the inside of the baked goods case with some chemical spray. The case was full of baked goods. This last time we went to get coffee and some goodies. We were in line for 40 mins waiting to order and when it was our turn, we winded up only getting one cookie because we saw the employee dump the coffee filter into the garbage can and pound it out against the can. That grossed us out. We think management needs to train the young kids they employ to pay attention to detail and follow correct sanitation protocols."}
{"text":"Vegan tofu Benedict with potatoes was perfection!!! First time here today and I was impressed. Didn't try the coffee but my meal as well as my mother's San Diegan scramble were on point. I look forward tk going back here soon to try their other delightful creations."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ambiance is perfect and the place is very well kept and clean.   Not to mention the coffee there is delicious. I will go in and order something new all the time. On top of the fantastic drinks the food is also incredibly yummy.  If you in the area, you have to stop by! One of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"The chorizo omelet was incredible! It tasted fresh and healthy! As for my boyfriends breakfast sandwich, I believe it should be served with something else on the side (fruit, corn beef hash, potatoes). Not just the egg sandwich only. The plate did not look that appealing.  My side was a bland/simple salad but it kept me interested in my plate and added color. I would recommend this place if you are celebrating an important day and trying to spend a little bit more money than usual."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is a great place to hang out and have a drink and a bite to eat. Great food and the coffee is fantastic. Very kind employees as well. The free wi-fi is nice to have as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best waffle I've ever had!  Great coffee!  Love the fresh ingredients!  Breakfast burritos are good as well.  My favorite breakfast spot in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Two stars for late night convenience. Negative three stars for how cheap this place is. And by cheap I don't mean price wise. I mean low quality and bad service wise. It's a shame that its come to this. I understand I could easily cross the street and grab a super bird from dennys. But sometimes, that just doesn't cut it.  There really needs to be more open, late night. When it comes to Vegas. No one minds forking up a few extra bucks for some late night breakfast. But this is ridiculous. I think the only item I enjoyed while dining here. Was there 7$ orange juice. Which again was overpriced. But that's just vegas for you.  I think treasure island all around is a bad hotel. They can't get anything right. Not even a damn cafe to serve some decent food. Just save your cash. Cross to Denny's. Or some other restaurant."}
{"text":"Just 3 Words....  Strawberry Champagne Cupcakes= Yummy!"}
{"text":"I would eat their supreme burrito every day if I could. It's seriously that good! Pair it with their iced chai tea, and the day can't get better. My young kids and husband love this place too, family friendly -- great for grabbing food real quick or hanging out!"}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming, so maybe the store has changed. I visited once after the owner's first appearance on Cupcake Wars. I was looking forward to trying one of her cupcakes and was disappointed when the restaurant was unusually warm and was filled with flies. I noticed that all the cupcake holder/plates that are featured in the photo section as \"pastry case\" were uncovered so that flies were landing on many of the displayed cupcakes while many of the staff stood around in a daze. It was unappealing and the cupcakes looked dried out as well.  Fortunately there was a larger, sealed display case with shelves, but it had a smaller variety. I chose a flavor (lemon) that was less appealing simply because I didn't want my dessert to have been exposed to farm flies. It took some effort to get attention from the staff and a girl begrudgingly helped me. After several requests, I got a \"to go\" container.   The cupcake was good enough and moist enough and the price wasn't bad for a cupcake these days. I wouldn't say that it lived up to my expectations. The frosting had almost a floral or pledge-like note, and while I tolerate butter in buttercreams, you can actually see the oily sheen of butter in the swirls of the Shop's cupcakes. I realize that this is a personal preference and that most people really like lots of butter in their confections so you can take this criticism with a grain of salt. In spite of the floral, stick of butter taste, I appreciated that the frosting job was very cute. The store itself was cute too. Hopefully the A/C works better now and my experience was an anomaly."}
{"text":"Cute little diversion from the busy world. An all American breakfast never fails and their coffee is strong :)"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the cutest spots in Gilbert. I am surprised to see that it has some reviews under 5 stars!  Quality food a drinks in a very cute a hipster setting. You walk into the main dining area with the ordering area on the left and cute wifi nook on the right. If you walk straight though there is great patio seating in a beautiful garden setting.  Offering a variety of breakfasts, brunch & lunch options along with a wide variety of pastries and baked goods that change daily and some of the most yummy coffee drinks in the valley.  Recommendations:  Breakfast: The San Diegan Lunch: The Turkey Club Baked Goods: Peanutbutter & Chocolate Chip Scone, Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake, Red Velvet Cupcake, Carrot Cake Cupcake Coffee: Black & White Mocha, MochaNut (Mocha w. Coconut) or Vanilla Americano  This place can get SUPER busy just like Joe's Farm Grill depending on the time of day and day of the week. Although they seem to pack in the business just about any time that they are open. This is a great place to bring friends or visiting family as it has WAY more atmosphere than you average coffee house! Everything that I have ever had is amazing!   The Coffee Shop has also been featured on Cupcake Wars and was voted Best Cupcake in the East Valley. One thing is for sure the quality & consistency will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  A group of us went in for breakfast and ended up trying some of the desserts.  Fabulous!  Pumpkin whoopie pie will haunt me and I may have to have my friends figure out how to mail me a dozen.  The red velvet cupcake, which I love anything red velvet, was very good.  I had the chicken breakfast burrito - very good, but what made it was the salsa - excellent."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is amazing! The coffee is great and the lunch options are pretty yummy. Only complaint is that finding seating can be a bit of an issue. Weekdays tend to be better!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay to me. I have been a few times and always found the service pretty rude and slow. The only times the service has been good have been when there have been guys working behind the counter. The women who work there seem to always be kind of...eh...annoyed? Cranky? Unhelpful?  I am always excited to try the cupcakes because they look so pretty and they carry that whole \"won something on Food Network\" badge of honor. But honestly, I don't think they are that great.   Unlike others here, I think they are better than  Sprinkles (not a big Sprinkles fan, personally- I bake!) but they are not as good as homemade. They use a lot of cherry or almond extract without labeling the items as such and I find the flavor off-putting to say the least. Nothing like biting into a vanilla or \"birthday cake\" cupcake only to taste...blech...artificial extract flavoring! Chocolate seems to have it, too.   Not awful, not great. Just eh. It's a cute place, though, and I love supporting a local business...so I pop in now and again :)"}
{"text":"The chai tea is sooooo good. Love their breakfast burritos and the rosa breakfast sandwich is way delicious. Lunch is great too."}
{"text":"This adorable little coffee shop is right off Ray road. If you blink, you may miss the turn!!! Lively environment with Wi-Fi internet makes this a great place for study groups. Only bad thing about this place is how small the parking lot is because most times it's full!  As far as food goes-they serve breakfast omelettes, burritos, and sandwiches. The club sandwich is DECLICIOUS on wheat bread (I haven't tried anything else yet because I'm stuck on this one for now). This club is loaded with avocado, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and thick turkey slices.  All of their vegetables come from a local farm and are fresh & full of flavor :-D  As far as cupcakes-I've tried the birthday cake, chocolate chip cookie dough, red velvet, and the chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. My absolute favorites are the chocolate chip cookie dough and the chocolate peanut butter cupcakes.  The chocolate chip cookie dough has mini chocolate chips throughout the cupcake and the cookie-dough frosting!! SO GOOD!! The chocolate peanut butter cupcake's frosting tastes similar to the inside peanut butter of a Reese's peanut butter cup. Every cupcake I've tried from here is always moist and delicious!"}
{"text":"Such amazing little place and the food is amazing and I love the staff... I go there everyday and  its always the same....GREAT....The bake goodies are like heaven....."}
{"text":"I love the coffee shop! It's a great place to relax on the patio & have brunch. The san diegan & TJ omelettes are soo good!"}
{"text":"Great place to hangout or come to work! Super friendly staff, great coffee, and lots of seating.   We stopped in during a Tuesday afternoon to get some work done and it was an excellent environment to focus and get some stuff done. Lots of other work meetings or interviews happening here and there, as well. The breakfast food is real good too!  10/10 would come back to visit!"}
{"text":"A really trendy and seemingly popular place since every time I have gone there, it's filled. It has outdoor and indoor seating. I love the coffee as well as the cupcakes. They do offer salads and sandwiches, but I haven't eaten them, so I can't give an opinion on this. It's a great place to meet for coffee."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast.  A few of us had the pancake tower - pancakes are good and fluffy, and they were nice enough to put the eggs, bacon and patties on the side. Huge portion for a good price - $15, especially since it is in a convenient location. Service was very kind and fast and they accommodated all our needs. Would definitely recommend and also go back for a huge breakfast!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. The food was rich and included high quality ingredients. We also enjoyed the ambiance. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Staff was polite and professional.  My friends and I all enjoyed our food quite a bit, and I had a HUGE smoked salmon plate with bagel, red onion, tomatoes, capers, cream cheese for $17.50.  It could have easily fed two people.  My buddy had the Chilaquiles with fried eggs, tortillas, rojo chicken, ranchero sauce, jack,  cheddar and cotija cheese, onion, cilantro and crema for $17.95.  Would go back.....wanna give it another shot...but gotta say, on this day, at this time, this food and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This breakfast was such a disappointment. Over priced, canned sauce, salty, made with a Doritos kinda chips, not fresh cut tortillas, also had  chicken, chilaquiles do not have chicken. Would not recommend this place at all, not even if it's the only place in the whole strip. Friendly customer service, too bad the is not a review for the staff."}
{"text":"Picture the least attractive person you'd settle for if you were drunk and desperate.  Replace 'person' with 'restaurant' and The Coffee Shop seriously tests this minimum standard.  Open 24 hours, this place has a comically bipolar menu.  Hmm, how do I decide between Trout Almondine, Teriyaki Glazed Pacific Salmon Bowl, and a Stuffed Philly Cheese Steak Potato?  Yeah...I didn't...I chose the pancakes w/ bananas and caramelized almonds.  Not bad.  Factor in the lame Denny's like atmosphere and you should really avoid being drunk and desperate enough to eat here.  Note:  They have an offshoot neighbor that specializes in Pho.  Weird.  But I would try that in a hearbeat before going back here.  That's open 3 AM on Friday/Saturday and midnight on Sunday-Thursday."}
{"text":"Love this place, yummy BIG breakfast burritos!!! Friendly staff and fresh yummy food. The only thing I wish theyd do is to get fly/bee traps, not fun swishing flies and bees off your food the whole time out on patio. Other than that its a nice ambiance and we will go often."}
{"text":"Ouch, overpriced food! But hey, it's Vegas, I guess!  Ate here with Erica C. and as she has already said, indeed it was the most expensive chicken strips ever! Was really good though, it was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. The honey-mustard dip was delicious! I ended up dipping my fries in it too.  Got the Cheeseburger, which was alright. The fries that came with it was the star of the dish, they were so good! extra crispy and still tasted like potatoes.  Expect slow service. There was about three people in the restaurant and the server took at least 10 minutes to greet us."}
{"text":"Food is great and the drinks are yummy too. Ordered egg salad sandwich on croissant and their iced coffee & Arnold Palmer. I would have given this place 5 stars except there are SO MANY FLIES in this place!!! I can see the flies crawling on all the pastries and that was a negative. Other than the flies, everything else was great :)"}
{"text":"Found this cute little cafe on my way to the ticket booth in treasure island.  Decided to give it a try and I was pretty happy here. I got the southern comfort and it was just ok but with some hot sauce, it really spiced up the dish and gave that umph that I wanted. My boyfriend got the country fries steak and eggs and it was pretty good. I loved that the steak was still crispy, despite the gravy on top. We were both pretty satisfied with our breakfast. I took off one star only because the service was so slow and the meal was pretty pricey but hey, you're in Vegas. Other than that, if I'm I'm the mood for brunch and I'm on this end of the strip, I would definitely stopped by."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and the food was more than decent, but not spectacular. VERY SLOW service. Our server was horrible. She had this funky look on her face. We thought that she was making faces, but realized that was her natural expression since she was like that with everyone else. Weird.  Had the sirloin benedict (instead of canadian bacon, it has sirloin pieces) which was different but still tasty. Hash browns were yummy. And the pancakes? I don't know what they did, but they were the tastiest most fluffiest pancakes I've had in awhile. Really great pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Good coffee house. They variety of selections, great services. Although, sitting can be a challenge during lunch hours. I recommend the Spanish coffee, it's good."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from here and love Joe's Farm Grill so figured we would give this place a try since they are known for their sweet treats. I couldn't wait to grab a few desserts for the family to try. I was so disappointed because it all looked so good BUT there were flies inside the dessert area just having a field day with the sweets! They were all over the desserts. We had to walk out because of this. Disappointed that the glass sliding door could have just been kept shut so this could have been prevented. This was an automatic turn off."}
{"text":"This place is great! A hidden little gem in Gilbert. Love the cupcakes! To me it's moist and love the buttercream icing they use.  The ONLY thing is during the intense summer months of AZ they do leave out cupcakes and whoopie pies on the counter. With the sweltering heat, I just don't think it's a good idea. The flies are also a fan of the baked goods, beacause they are all over them. Swooning and landing on the deliciousness. I bought one of those counter cupcakes and my tummy did not agree. So now I only purchase the ones in the cooled display fridge. But over all we love this quaint coffee shoppe :)"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Way too expensive even for Vegas. We waited for about 12 min minutes before our server came to greet us. She wasn't very friendly when she did come..Food was just ok. Chipotle is way better and cheaper. Kahunaville is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop! We used to stop by at least once a weekday when the kiddo was going to school at GCS. I still stop by for a Scotch KISS Latte whenever I get a chance (and a white-chocolate-mixed-berry-muffin)."}
{"text":"I love it here, been coming for years. The food is great, the coffee is wonderful and the staff has always been friendly. The one hangup I've always had is the lack of enough indoor seating . The back room has so much potential for more seating, there's just so much wasted space. If they could at least provide misters/fans in the summer and space heaters In the winter for outdoor seating I know I'd come more often and it would be more comfortable for the guests"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Good food, cute ambiance and lovely cupcakes, who could ask for anything more?"}
{"text":"For sure a 3 star location - no more, located within the treasure island hotel.   The food gets the job done, but very mediocre - service also is choppy, during my several visits, we were serviced by various people and with that, one would forget to come back with our request, so we'd need to ask again. They operate as if they're short staffed.  My first visit they forgot to bring the table the requested coffee, tea and water, and on my second visit I made it clear to substitute the hash browns for fruit, and that just didn't happen.  If you're looking for an \"OK\" breakfast, enough to get your tummy some food, then by all means eat here especially considering the wait at other well known breakfast places (we were time sensitive due to a convention we were exhibiting at the venetian)."}
{"text":"Nice place. Outdoor seating is great under trees and surrounded by birds. It gets very crowded on the weekend. This place offers food ad well as drinks. The music on Saturday mornings trends to be a bit hip hoppie. , if you wait a little longer, you'll enjoy the relaxing atmosphere and worry music once the crowd leave"}
{"text":"Ambiance: very clean beautiful indoor and probably one of the best outdoor patios in all of Phoenix. But the only reason for 4 stars and not 5, was the flies. They we're everywhere and we had to wave them away while eating. Maybe it's the trash tank right next to the back patio. I just Hope they do something to get rid of them.   Breakfast and coffee: All of our breakfast was delicious and fresh. Coffee was hot and freshly brewed. You taste the the flavor in all the ingredients.   Service: Great service and very friendly. It's self serve when u order but they bring out ur food.   Price is really good for the taste."}
{"text":"fantastic service, fantastic atmosphere, fantastic espresso.  plus they offer free wifi, woot! i love it there. i will say the website could be more user friendly, and perhaps a street sign would be helpful?  hard to find for a newcomer.  once you discover the place though, you're hooked.     :)"}
{"text":"I love the Coffee Shop!! Such a great atmosphere and the food is fabulous. I love the waffles with the whipped cream and fresh berries. They have great sandwiches too and their pastries are just perfect. Make sure to sit outside while you hang with your friends or family!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here! The location is beautiful; right on a small farm with lush foliage and large outdoor patio. I had an iced coffee and split both a vegan, double chocolate cupcake (couldn't tell it was vegan!) and a gingery type of cookie. Really, the only down side were all the flys outside, but I guess that's what you get for being on a farm. Also, while the cupcake was good, they're not the reason I would return. For me, the pleasant atmosphere was the winning feature!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for late dinner during a recent stay at Treasure Island. Gotta say, i loved the food. The burger i got was really good, tasted so good with avocado and the grilled onions. My gf got a Taco Salad, which i liked, but she thought was decent as best.   The only issue i had with this place was the lack of staff in the restaurant to keep things running efficiently. The people who work there are great, very friendly and courteous just like you see all around TI, but when i went they were seriously understaffed. It seemed like they were packed but only had the host and a couple waiters/waitresses and a manager. Things could have been a lot more efficient had there been more staff. The wait to order food was a little longer than i'm used to waiting, same with getting the check. The food came out in good time though despite it being pretty packed. There were two couples behind us complaining about how long they had to wait despite there being open seats, but it seems like the host was explaining they can't seat people if they don't have the right amount of staff to serve everyone.   It's a great place to grab a bite, they just need a little extra help though when its busy time. i will definitely go back next time im at T.I. cuz the burger was seriously delicious, hopefully by then they will be better prepared to handle more customers and i'll update my review. For now its A-OK!"}
{"text":"Coffee here is really good and its always clean here i would go everyday if i lived closer! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Would probably never come here again unless I absolutely had to.  Service was extremely poor, food was overpriced and not that great.  I had a veggie burger and fries which was okay.  Friends had nachos- the cheese on them was kind of funky but the toppings of beans, jalepenos, olives, etc were okay.  Originally we were going to get the appetizer platter but after hearing how many pieces of each item were on the platter, it was way to overpriced and didn't seem that great.  Good: not much...standard cafe fare Bad: service, price, food  Overall: Like I said, I probably wouldn't come back here, it's really not worth it.  It is the only food place open late at TI but the menu is pretty limited.  Don't expect great service...I waited forever to get water refills!!"}
{"text":"Day 1: After clubbing at TAO, we come back to the hotel and we go... \"What should we eat?  Nothing is open... Coffee shop is open? LET's GO!!!\"  Day 2: After another night of clubbing... \"FAWK we are back at the hotel already... sooo hungry.. should we walk around the strip? nahhhh lets just go to the coffee shop :(  Day 3: Cracked out after 2 days of clubbing and a full day of pool party... \"F*ck it.  Coffee shop it is\"  Ok... We ate at the Coffee shop 3x while we were in Vegas for the weekend.  Not because it was good, but because we had no choice...  They trick you with convenience... This place is open 24 hr and is located right next to the elevators.  Service is bad, the food is bad and overpriced!!!  Can we PLEASE remember to get food before we come back to the hotel next time?!?! This place is so not worth going to.  With the amount you spend here, you can get better food elsewhere. Here's a good example: Their spaghetti with meatballs is like $18 and it tastes like chef boyardee spaghetti with meatballs http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/rLhc543pshadqbfgelyHiw/l (which you can get for $1 a can when you buy 10 at Ralphs) UGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  *edit* NO THERE WERE NO OTHER OPTIONS I SWEAR!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! If I could own a coffee shop it would be this one. Every time I go I wish I could buy the place! The food, drinks, bakery items, atmosphere- all just fabulous!!! If you go for breakfast you HAVE to try the Papas burrito. It is just SO good! I also think their scones are the best around. They are never dry and slightly sweeter than most scones.  I know they have had huge accolades for their cupcakes and while they are pretty and I think they are good I don't know that they are the best ever. I would pick a scone or the burrito any day over the cupcakes.  The best thing is to get a seat outside when the weather is nice and just relax, watch the  birds and drink a coffee with breakfast!"}
{"text":"You know this is a great spot before you even walk in the door. The parking lot is always packed and the patio is jammed with people. It has a great community vibe, and is always filled with smiling people.   The smiles are surely due to the great coffee and amazing food. This morning I went with the San Diegan egg scramble and it was an absolute breakfast masterpiece. I highly recommend this awesome spot!"}
{"text":"After partying allllllll night, I was getting hungry.  Not to mention, it was 7 o'clock in the morning.  At that time, we were drinking at Breeze Bar, so we just took a few steps over to The Coffee Shop for breakfast.  I don't know if it was because I pretended to be blind and asked the waitress for a menu in braille, but the food and service totally sucked.  I was looking forward to some hearty eggs and bacon, but all I got was dog food.  It made me sick.  Fortunately, I had some beef jerky in my room that helped calm my stomach."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I think it's the location that really does it for me. Every time I go there I always have to do a drive through Agritopia. I love looking at all of the bungalow houses and taking a walk along the gardens.  Ok, back to The Coffee Shop. This place has a cute modern feel to it with plenty of seating inside and out. I really enjoy their turkey & havarti sandwich and surprisingly their fish tacos on Friday at quit delis! The only think I do not like about this place is all the flies they get inside and out. It is a little off putting when trying to decide if you will take a bagel with a fly or a cupcake with a fly- so sadly I cannot comment on any of they backed goods since I am not big on flies."}
{"text":"So, finally made it to the \"Agritopia\" farm area of Gilbert... We originally went for the food truck night, and ended up dining at The Coffee Shop. The decor and ambiance is super cute, cozy, and still has the barn like features. We didn't get any drinks, only sandwiches. But... Their drink/coffee menu looks yummy! We tried the California Club and the pastrami sandwich. They came paired with a side of Fritos chips. The meat on both sandwiches were decent sized slices. We ended up having dessert with one of the food truck vendors, but we sat on the relaxing outside patio of this place. We would definitely return back to this little gem."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a weekday. The wait time for food is average (15 minutes). Prices are too high for me. I ordered an eggs benedict and milk. The milk put my bill ($24) to be a little higher than the Treasure Island buffet's breakfast price ($23) down the aisle. For breakfast at least and if you want to order a drink, it's better to just go to the buffet where it's faster (food is already made so you don't have to wait for it) and more food's available.  The eggs benedict tasted good, and there was enough for two meals. Service was good. My waitress was attentive; two seconds after I was ready for the check, she asked me if I wanted the check."}
{"text":"Love this place. I can come here and get a quality meal with fresh ingredients. I have used them as my study haven. The San Diegen is my favorite breakfast item, but I have to admit I have not ordered much else since I love it so much. I have never had a bad sandwich from here either. When I have reached my study milestone I will treat myself to a sweet treat. They are a real down home establishment."}
{"text":"This place is so flippin' cute! I'm having a hard coming to terms with the fact that a place with such personality is located in suburbia!  The open, farm-like, garden landscaping makes for a magnificent morning sitting on the patio and the decor has a lot of style and character.   My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the flavor of our lattes drinks, even though they could have been made hotter. The Pumpkin Spice is waaay better than Starbuck's version!    The pastry case was beautiful and filled with cupcakes (many vegan), but our cupcake did not taste as beautiful as it looked.  The icing tasted like cheap, sugary Safeway icing and the lemon cake was artificial tasting.  The cupcake was a bit of a letdown since the baker/owner/whatever has signs all over the place exclaiming \"omg! I won a cupcake TV show!\"   I wish it wasn't out in the boonies, I would love to hang out at this place more often."}
{"text":"The place is awesome in that it's the only nice place around open 24/7 and very conveniently located next to the elevator. The bad, SO overpriced! The food was good, but not amazing nor worth the price. But hey when you're tired/drunk, it'll do wonderfully! Staff isn't very attentive either..."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here optionally but if it's 2 in the morning and the rest of your group is incapacitated to walk anywhere but your own hotel at TI, then this is the spot.  My friend was craving the steak and eggs (which came with toast and hashbrowns). This was about $20+. The steak itself was cooked medium rare as requested but was severely bland- I'm not too privy on adding salt to my steak after it has been cooked.  What made this trip quite unpleasant was the long wait. 4 out of 5 people at the table fell asleep (I survived!). I thought things could have moved along, but not sure if me being tired made me more impatient. Nevertheless, I would avoid unless you don't have any other choice!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing - I've always known The Coffee Shop to serve Pho! It's super convenient after a night out on the Strip to order a hot bowl of Pho - it is also convenient to have it the morning after! HOWEVER, they do not serve Pho until 11am!! We learned the hard way as we were so excited to have a bowl of Pho first thing in the morning to help cure a headache; however, we were informed that Pho wasn't served until 11am. So disappointed but so lazy to go anywhere else so I ended up getting an omelette. Obvi, everything is super overpriced (it is the Strip, duh!) but the service was great and the food came out hot and fast!   Another plus is that the food here can be ordered if you're staying at the TI for room service... :)"}
{"text":"Such a great quick place for a yummy breakfast sandwich! The cupcakes are amazing too! And great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My good pal recommended this place as our next brunch date. I was a tad bit skeptical because I HATE breakfast foods and I honestly thought this place was gonna be like IHOP but whateva. BOI was I wrong. I got the San Diegan w/ extra avocado and once I took the first bite It was like angels were singing to me. I was shook to the core and It got me wanting more. This place was so good that I went back here another time! I am so sorry that I doubted the Coffee Shop's potential... please forgive me"}
{"text":"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  WORST place I've ever been to in Vegas, right when we walked in we were VERY rudely greeted, lady right away told me that because our group was large if we don't split up we'd be charge a 18% tip, (which I appreciate her telling me) but I was caught off guard and I said excuse me could you repeat that? she rolled her eyes at me and repeated herself.. okay whatever hoe, I let it go.  We were sat fairly quickly, my group was a table of 4 at a booth, I was on the outer side, I'm a decently tall guy (about 6 feet) so when you sit me in a booth the size meant for midgets my legs will stick out a bit on the edge, the server came by and kicked my foot.. \"HEY MOVE YOUR FOOT INSIDE\" I obeyed her orders, a bit shocked but whatever YOLO HO, so I did. after she walked away I discussed it with my friends we agreed that maybe English wasn't her first language so just to let it go.   but of course my leg slipped out a bit again, she walked to our table and kicked my foot again- \"REALLY? AGAIN? YOU REALLY PUT YOUR FOOT OUT AGAIN?\" I replied that I'm a bigger guy and I can't keep my leg inside completely under the table (mind you I wasn't STICKING IT OUT, and nobody was going to trip over my food) then she starts to lash out at me about how I can't keep my foot inside, so I finally got fed up and said \"YOU REALLY ARE GOING TO KICK ME AND YELL AT ME?!!?\" she said \"YOU KICKED ME, YOU JUST KICKED ME\" wtf r u serious?!?!?!?! I wasn't even moving my foot the whole time we were talking, she accused me of kicking her when my foot wasn't even moving?! go lick a nut lady, you're effin crazy!!!   I made it a point to her that I wasn't going to take her yelling at me and she replied \"OHH I'M JUST TEASING YOUUUU\" then walked away, yea no lady, this shit ain't going to fly in my house. I'm usually VERY courteous to my servers and I know they have a tough job, but when you're going to YELL AT ME?! and accuse me of doing something I didn't do you can suck it.   got up, went to the rest of our tables (we had 3 tables total) stood up and left, we're not BEGGING to eat here, you can take your peasant food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love stopping by here for the relaxing casual atmosphere and for a nice cup of coffee. I finally came to try the food during my lunch hour and had the vegan taco salad wrap. It was really delicious and I could tell they use only the freshest ingredients! There is ample seating area either in the trendy and chic indoors or outside on the patio which is also dog-friendly. After eating, it's fun to walk next door through Barnone (a craftsman community) to check out all the independent shops and restaurants as well as the farm store to buy some fresh produce!"}
{"text":"I have been back to the Coffee Shop several times now with my husband. He can't go there enough! He loves the Papa's burrito filled with cheese, potatoes, and egg (he does not like bacon so they give him another salsa instead!) and he is a happy camper! He would go there every day if I would let him! We both get the Chai Tea Latte's and enjoy the full, creamy flavor! It has become a favorite spot to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful AZ weather even in the summer (early morning of course! They open at 7AM and yes we are there!)."}
{"text":"If I lived down there, I would go here so often!  Great selection of baked goods/food ... and of course, coffee."}
{"text":"Most expensive Chicken Strips ever! They were $16 and only came with four strips. That's $4 a strip! I mean, it was hella good, but definitely not worth the price! We also had the Cheeseburger here for $14. The fries were on point and the meat in the burger cooked just the way I like it!! Everything was delicious.....BUT then again I was drunk. What doesn't taste good when you're drunk and starving?! The food is definitely WAY overpriced here which is why I took one star away. Another star taken away for it's slow/bad service."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee - love the Spanish Latte and the Black & White, hot or iced.  Breakfast was delicious, haven't tried lunch yet.  Cupcakes are beautiful, but I've had better tasting ones.  The only downside is that the coffee sometimes takes a very long time to make, especially the Spanish Latte, it seems.  Overall, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I used absolutely love this place, and used to come here all the time for the vegan cupcakes. It is really hard to find a delicious vegan cupcake in the valley and it is one of the things they are known most for but in about six visits over the past month they have stopped carrying their vegan cupcakes. They really need to bring them back! Or take them off their website as well. BRING BACK THE VEGAN CUPCAKES!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Saw them on Cupcake Wars so had to try their cupcakes out.  I thought it was a bakery but it turns out they're more like a restaurant.  They sell brunch items like sandwiches, omelettes and burritos.   They have a pastry section of cupcakes, cookies and whoopie pies.   Tried their mixed berry cupcake and a strawberry whoopie pie. Unfortunately, we came around 1:30pm and some of their more original flavors were already sold out. :( So I guess I gotta come earlier next time.  Our Turkey club sandwich was HUGE. It was enough to share with my friend. They have several tea selections too. I had the pomegranate tea on ice.   They have register screens that the cashier will swing around if you want to add tip to your meal.   Parking was a bit tight but there's a lot of space to let your kids run around.  They're located next to Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"A wonderful quaint coffee shop in the heart of Agritopia. The desserts are delicious. I wish they would come up with a vegan dessert (at least one or two) to give plant-based folk & dairy-intolerant people a chance to enjoy! But whatevs... The coffee is yum. I get Americanos, so I can vouch for the deliciousness of their espresso.  The menu is varied. I have tried the vacation bagel (the yummy goodness with honey and almonds), and a few bites of random desserts that my hubby or kids would order.  But my absolute hands down favorite was discovered yesterday when I tried their taco salad wrap. This is such a fantastic blend of flavors. Definitely recommend it. I wish I took a picture but I was too hungry ;)  Anyhow, the more stuff like the taco wrap and vacation bagel they can come up with, the more of my business they'll see.  A great place to come hang out with a friend and chat over a cup of coffee. The area is beautiful too. I've walked through the citrus trees before and it was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Gilbert."}
{"text":"Oreo cupcakes, taco wraps, tofu benedict, and vacation bagels. I think I've tried every vegan option they have and I've loved everything I've ever tried. They only have vegan cupcakes in stock sometimes when a local bakery supplies them but the rest of the dishes are menu staples. It gets pretty busy here but it's a fun spot to hang out with friends and family or to have a meeting or study session. Like the whole area, there's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. It has a chill vibe and I can never tell what kind of crowd will be there. Sometimes it's stay at home moms or families and sometimes it's college students. Everyone's super friendly. You order at the counter and they have their menu on a huge board plus a selection of pastries on display. Once you order it can take a while to get food orders, drinks come through pretty quickly. If I come alone I bring a book or some work I need to catch up on. Or I love to have coffee dates here and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Holy shit! It's not a Starbucks! This is a rarity in the Far East Valley. I didn't think this was possible. Granted, the surrounding neighborhood (Agritopia) creeps me out a bit (all I could think when I drove here was \"little boxes, on the hillside...little boxes, made of ticky-tacky...\"), but cute little shop.   Good (and cheap!) coffee. I also had an excellent chai latte here. The one sandwich I had here (the chicken honey mustard) was also tasty. The scones were to die for (and the flavors rotate in and out). The cupcakes are pretty (and glittery?), but I was kind of underwhelmed by them (but all cupcakes just kind of taste super sugary to me).   Now if only the wi-fi was a bit more reliable and there were more outlets..."}
{"text":"Had the rosa breakfast sandwich and it was amazing!!! shared it as well as a donut thing... (Fo-nut ;)) that was awesome with my mom! Very relaxing atmosphere and very nice staff"}
{"text":"Before I go any further, this is a 3.5 rating, not a full 4.... I did enjoy hanging out here, but a few things could be improved.  Arrived on an early Sunday afternoon and it was quite busy... long line to order food.  I had a plain bagel with cream cheese and it wasn't anything special.  I *was* going to get coffee (duh, I'm in a coffee shop) but I'm trying to take it easy on the caffeine.. so I had a pomegranate tea.  We were here for quite a long time, so before I left, I took a cupcake to-go.  Price to Flavor: for a local, family run, coffee shop, they are on the not-so-cheap side... 3$ for a cupcake, just under $3 for a single-refill tea and about the same for a plain bagel with basic cream cheese... that's a lot for what I got.  Granted, their cupcake was freaking delicious and the tea was tasty...  Staff: fast, chipper, but with an air of \"you're not cool enough to be here or for me to acknowledge you\".. yeah, I think that's what stuck to me the most.. it was a bit of a snobby staff.  Maybe I'm just used to more down to earth service from the family that runs these businesses.  Everything else was nice.. ambiance is nice and relaxing.. open.  The back room has couches to lounge in and that's nice, but the place is supposed to be a coffee place and it felt pretty crowded and noisy with families and couples eating and not necessarily relaxing and having a coffee.  You get a more 'coffee shop' feel from other area coffe shops...  I think the staff attitude and the \"hipster\" air they put out just was more off-putting than I expected from a local run small business that is NOT in Tempe or Scottsdale.. come on, gimme a break."}
{"text":"I glanced through the other reviews, and I agree that it is overpriced, but, with the exception of the buffet possibly, I think everything at Treasure Island is overpriced. There were a few things that irritated me. I am not one that needs to be given free things (though I do love free!). However, the server forgot to put in one of our orders (there were only 6 of us), and then my other friend's food was cold, and so she asked to have it heated. The server left to do something and forgot about her. The next time she saw her, the server remembered, and took it to get it reheated (finally). The place was dead at this time, by the way. So with both of those incidents that were the fault of the server, it would have been nice to be offered a discount, free dessert, something, but we got none of that. Overall I think we were all fairly satisfied with the food (though mine was a little too oily). My friend had a breakfast sandwich at Denny's the night before that she thought was DISGUSTING, and the one at The Coffee Shop made up for it. The server, while slow, was very nice. The selection was good, and we got seated right away (thank goodness because it took us forever to decide where to eat). I would eat there again in a pinch, but it isn't my first choice."}
{"text":"This place is a very good choice for breakfast or lunch! I've been for both and their breakfast burritos are so delicious. Big enough to share with someone too. For lunch, I always get the egg salad sandwich. Absolutely mouthwatering if you love eggs. I actually have cravings for it and I'm picky about egg salad. Their coffee is pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but there is a ton to choose from to change it up. I have yet to try their pastries but they look so good in the window. The only thing I dislike is the seating. Not a lot of seating inside and it's very open and everyone's conversation can be heard around the whole place. That's if you're lucky to get a spot inside. On the weekends it is very crowded and getting a seat is difficult. Sitting outside there in the summer with no misters on is very HOT and uncomfortable. The crowd tends to be quite hipster but based on the area it's not something I'm surprised about. Definitely worth giving a try because the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Locally owned and always friendly.  Great fresh food and an awesome relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"After a night out in Vegas, the last thing you want to do is travel far to find breakfast so you make your way downstairs and voila! The Coffee Shop greets you near the base of the T.I. elevators. I never expect great things out of the casino's cafe but it usually does enough to hit the spot. The Coffee Shop lived up to my expectation and neither impressed nor irritated me.   I ended up deciding that a sandwich sounded more appealing than breakfast since it was after noon by the time we stumbled downstairs. I chose the French dip with a side of fries. The sandwich was good but not the best I've ever had. I asked for a side of ranch and our wonderful waiter, whose name I meant to remember but have now forgotten, brought me a huge bowl of ranch. He knows the way to my ranch-loving heart!   My friends ordered an assortment of breakfast and lunch items. I heard that the omelette wasn't great but the oatmeal was pretty good. Our waiter further impressed us by offering to split the bill five ways, which made our lives much easier.   At $21 with tax and tip, it's way more than I think the sandwich was worth but I guess that's the price you pay in Vegas for convenience."}
{"text":"Since I didn't get to have my steak and eggs for dinner the night before we made it a point to come down for breakfast. Prices have gone up and we didn't realize it till we got the bill. $20 for measley steak and eggs plate. Nice buttery eggs and crisp hashbrowns but the steak was sinewy and rimmed with gristle."}
{"text":"I'm teetering between a 3 and 1/2 and 4. Pushing it to a 4 because of the food! Well one dish that I can't seem to stray from.   My fiancée and I probably frequent this place 3-4 times a month for breakfast. Cute neighborhood coffee shop feel. Very \"friends\" -esque.    I always get the SAN DIEGAN open faced omelette with avocado and a side of salsa. Light egg pancake smeared with sour cream, crispy bacon, caramelized mushrooms, crisp browned potatoes, topped with cheddar cheese, super fresh feta, and green onions!!!! Adding avocado is extra. What makes it is smothering it in their house made salsa. BOTTLE IT!!! I will take 10 cases please. Perfect amount of acidity, slight heat, and a surprising sweetness!!   My fiancée has the same dish cling problems with the TJ open face omelette. Same idea but with a tasty flavorful chorizo! (He also avocados and salsas it)   The only downside to this place is the seating. We come here on weekends and even weekday mornings and find it hard to find seating inside. A lot of patrons linger with laptops or books. But it is a coffee shop so I guess it's understandable. Just a little inconvenient during the summer but we have no shame and will eat in the car! Outdoor seating is available on their cute patio which seems to be dog friendly :)    I have tried a sandwich before but nothing extraordinary, would really recommend breakfast though, just save a seat for me! :)"}
{"text":"Another great coffee shop :)   This one is perched amidst the fields of Agritopia, and the building itself is actually an old tractor shed. Once more, a \"Joe's\" project that has a retro/modern industrial feel.   The dining room has a nice amount of tables and chairs and there is a sitting room at the back with some comfy couches and coffee tables - definitely a cozy spot. The large patio is lovely when the weather is right and the surrounding foliage keeps it from befalling the \"parking lot effect\" that so many Arizona patios face (parking lot effect definition: a great patio that is spoiled by a view of parked cars, smells of exhaust, and sounds of traffic - those things the Coffee Shop is NOT, thank goodness)   They have an awesome bakery counter (My favorite thing!) Try to get there in the morning for some DELICIOUS muffins, which are shaped like little loaves instead of like traditional muffins. I always try to find random seasonal flavors that aren't always there - the best one I've had was a strawberry lemon poppyseed muffin - to die for! Also high marks to the cinnamon roll, a peanut butter chocolate scone, and any of the cupcakes. The cookies and whoopie pies are hit and miss - they look adorable but don't quite stand up to the other offerings.   The food-food is also great - again, my preference is breakfast and we always share the Papas Breakfast Burrito (with eggs, bacon, potatoes, and salsa) as it is HUGE and definitely large enough for two, particularly if you're also getting a pastry. I've tried the Turkey Cranberry sandwich at lunchtime and it was tasty as well.   I have not actually had their coffee, but my sister and grandmother, who are both connoisseurs, swear by it so I feel comfortable recommending that as well. As for me, I'm usually ordering a big glass of fresh OJ.   I wish that they were open later (they close at 8 or 9pm most nights, 4pm on Sundays) - its the type of place I often think of for a late night snack and coffee once I've put the little one to bed and I'm always disappointed to remember they're already closed!  Lastly, as of my last visit with my son they did NOT have a changing table in the women's bathroom. Considering the large numbers of families/moms who frequent the shop, it really seems like a given and I was a bit shocked that they didn't have one - I ended up toting my son and what was left of my meal out to my SUV to change his diaper in the back, which doesn't exactly match up to the serene coffee shop experience I'm planning on when I come out to the Coffee Shop :)"}
{"text":"I don't really want to write a review because I want to keep this gem to myself! Their coffee, their breakfast, their chicken salad sandwich, he garden out back....perfection on perfection"}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Great place to come with the kids,  so much grass around here for them to run around and enjoy coupled with the delicious cupcakes!    I tried the San Diegian today and it was so good!  A must try for sure. Just love coming to this place, foods has NEVER  been a disappointment."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is a unique local place in Gilbert which I originally learned about it on Cupcake Wars. My favorite item there is the iced chai tea latte. I could have one latte after the other! I try out iced chai tea lattes at a lot of different coffee shops ... Definitely recommend trying it out here.  Otherwise, the breakfast food is decent. I've tried out the veggie scramble, one of the burritos (can't remember which), & also the all American breakfast. Nothing to write home about but satisfying.  Since I did see them on cupcake wars, I tried a couple of their cupcakes & other sweets. While really pretty looking, they're not that tasty. The cupcakes are really dense & the frosting is too sweet.  I'd say the best part of this place is the ambiance especially when the weather is nice. There's a lot of outdoor seating with a bunch of greenery surrounding the area. The only problem is there are always a lot of flies around. I've seen them sitting in / around the food area & the employees don't shoo them away.  If you're in the area, stop by and give it a shot."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of different drinks to choose from! The cashiers and baristas are always so warm and welcoming, never made me feel rushed when I wasn't familiar with the menu.   Personally I find their drinks can be on the sweet side but that can be easily modified! :)"}
{"text":"Didn't have the pleasure of dining at this place because the service was horrendous and we ended up leaving before we even ordered. A waitress came to take our order and gave us our drinks quickly. She didn't explain to us that she was taking drink orders but was not the waitress. When I asked her to make an order, she told me she would send over the waiter. I was totally fine with that.  The waiter was gentleman that had been standing there looking at me for 5 minutes. And I saw him waive the woman off and continue to do nothing after she had told him about our request. I complained to the host and he was completely unhelpful. He simply said that the server had a big table. He handled it completely wrong and passed the buck to the manager. It was an overall lack of teamwork on their part and terrible customer service."}
{"text":"When you've had a little too much to drink the night before, you need to come to The Coffee Shop to bring you back up to speed. Located in Treasure Island (TI) hotel, it has a homey, diner feel. The restaurant is open concept and people from the TI lobby and casino can see you and you can see them pass by. The waitresses are like second moms, always checking up on us and making sure we're doing ok. I love when a restaurant doesn't rush you to leave and allows you to take your time eating. \"Take all the time you want, Hon.\" Did I mention I liked this spot a lot?  Well, I already wanted to kiss this place because of their coffee. It wasn't because it was anything special, but because they gave you a cup of coffee and an extra pitcher with enough in it to refill your cup at least four more times! Can I get a \"what what\"! Seriously, we REALLY needed the caffeine! But, they don't stop there. We ordered their Italian omelette, and this was served to us in large portions, with a side of hash browns and generously buttered, toasted wheat bread. I knew we didn't have to eat anything else until dinner. The food was delicious too! Not to mention they had Tapatio sauce! My friend introduced this to me recently, and I got hooked. It's similar to Frank's red hot sauce, except it's spicier. I doused my entire omelette and hash browns with Tapatio sauce! Heaven! Surprisingly, their diner also served Pho and other Vietnamese dishes. So, if you'd rather eat this the morning after too much drinking, then by all means! Next time, we'll definitely give this part of the menu a go.    Overall, we really liked this restaurant. It's relatively affordable (it's still Vegas), serves up good brunch food in a comfortable atmosphere, practically gives you several coffee refills, and allows you to sit for long periods of time while people watching. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Everything I've had is delicious. My favorite is the Yountville omelet  (chorizo, avocado, sour cream and cheese) and the iced green tea. We love getting a cupcake to share too."}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered a veggie scramble with the side salad and it was a well balance of flavors (particularly love the vinaigrette dressing on the salad). Also great coffee, excellent service and a very trendy/cute ambiance."}
{"text":"LOVE the Coffee Shop!  Breakfast Burritos are delicious! Too big for one person to eat, so plan to share. Pretty outdoor patio, cozy neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"Been going to The Coffee Shop since it opened.  We go there less frequently now as the customer service levels have dropped drastically and the noise levels have increased.  I keep trying to write more but can't.   It's just not a place that I'm driven to go to anymore.  They are within walking distance but now that there is another shop which also has fresh-baked goodies, I think that's the spot that I'm going to be patronizing."}
{"text":"Here - there is delicious chai tea and other wonderful hot and cold beverages.  The food that is served looks delicious.  The people who have developed this concept are respected food entrepreneurs and social venue inventors.  I can't wait to see what they develop next.  This establishment is so apropos; one of Joe's seminal work was the Coffee Plantation (an organization still in existence today)."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The food is on the pricier side but keep in mind you're on the strip. This restaurant is clean and they're fast.The entire staff were friendly and very accommodating. Our favorite waiter is Arron and we always asked to sit in his section.  Arron highly exceptional customer service skills and friendly, positive personality is the main reason why we kept going there for breakfast. Arron made us feel at home and was a wonderful host and waiter. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Only tried the espresso. No need to try anything else. Rich, nutty, not bitter in any sense of the world, superior to the pencil-shavings tasting, dirty water that Starbucks is serving."}
{"text":"Since this place was in our hotel, we came here a lot for the pho. One of the nights, we had missed the window to order pho because it was part of a seperate menu. They had literally just served the last bowl. We were so heartbroken. I don't remember what time they stopped serving pho, but if you wanted some the next morning, it was available after 11 am.   The bowl of pho itself was a very generous bowl- coming from Texas, that says alot. There was also a lunch special that offered pho with an appetizer, but the waitress said the bowl was alot smaller than just ordering it by itself. Anyways, the one night where we did not order pho, I ordered french toast and hated it. The egg taste was way too strong. Hence why we only ordered the pho."}
{"text":"My wife and I did a stay at Treasure Island and had breakfast at the coffee shop we shared a Swiss mushroom omelet and coffee the food was hot and good. the hash Brown's for crispy everything was great. good friendly service."}
{"text":"Pho soup here not flavorful and needs improvement. California roll rice is hard and refrigerated. Service good. Clean environment  Food not a good value with so many other Cafe to eat at. Ate breakfast here. Sandwich and pastry average."}
{"text":"Best coffee, pastries and sandwiches in Gilbert!    Their coffee is consistently good, made by experienced people behind the counter. Every day they're baking up something different and yummy.  Some times it's worth the stop just to see what they've cooked up that day. For some coffee places it's too much to ask for great coffee AND great pastries, but this place offers both and more.  We've tried several of their sandwiches and each was perfect. They're great at everything they do.   On top of all that their well-manicured garden patio is a lush oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and food. The wait can get excessive at times and the place is really small so standing in line and eating indoors during the busy periods can get pretty claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! Went for Father's day and they had fresh banana pancakes yummy!!! Def must have breakfasts good portions."}
{"text":"If I were to base my place of residence on adorable, warm, and friendly coffee establishments, I would without a doubt move to South East Gilbert. It's a shame I live so far from this place.  The Coffee Shop is tucked into Agritopia (directly across from the farm stand and across the courtyard from Joe's Farm Grill) and has a good amount of seating inside and out. In addition to their coffee menu, they also serve breakfast and lunch, and have an awesome pastry case.   On this trip we didn't have a meal, just iced coffee and a huge chocolate chip cookie. The coffee was awesome and the cookie was soft with gooey chocolate chips. The line was pretty long to order but seemed to move quickly (even with some large, indecisive groups ahead of us).  Although there are numerous places between where I live and Gilbert to grab my daily iced coffee, whenever I am headed out that way I'll most likely just hold off so I can stop here and enjoy the surroundings."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere -- very retro modern, clean, bright, airy. And the (smallish) coffee cake is outstanding, flavorful without overdoing it, though at $3 seems a bit overpriced.  Coffee is very good -- not the best I've had, but certainly better than overly-bitter Starbucks, and reasonably priced at $1.80 for a medium (I think).  My 4-year-old daughter loved her pink cupcake ($2.75), though she mostly just ate the frosting, so it's a little hard to give a recommendation one way or the other.  (I'm sure they're great, at least based on the \"Cupcake Wars\" video, in which Coffee Shop wins.)  My daughter said her hot chocolate was ok, but claimed it tasted a little like coffee -- though I'm hoping she doesn't really know what coffee tastes like.  All in all a nice place and worth a return."}
{"text":"v. charming cafe, complete with beautiful pastry counter, excellent java offerings. quiet, spacious seating area inviting to catch up w/friends or curl up with a good read.  conveniently next door to Joe's Farmhouse Grill."}
{"text":"I frequent this place 3-5 times a WEEK. Doesn't help that I live so close :) I can't seem to get anything other than an Iced Chai Tea Latte. They are so good here... Definitely different than a Starbucks Chai but OH SO GOOD. And if you are there for breakfast my recommendation is the PARKER burrito - its simply amazing."}
{"text":"Get their sandwiches!! You won't regret it! Good selection of baked goods too. The scenery here is beautiful. There is a ton of eclectic seating inside as well."}
{"text":"A few of us tried The Coffee Shop this weekend for the first time. It was probably the best breakfast I have had in a long time.  I had an omelet that had bacon on it. Because of the bacon, I was fully expecting it to be on the greasier side. Not at all. Perfection! The bacon was crisp, meaty, and not greasy. The egg was done perfectly. This came with diced potatoes, seasoned with something, and not greasy at all.   What sealed the deal was the best blueberry scone I've ever had. I saw it in the case and tried to resist. However, after breakfast as I was sipping my coffee, it called to me. This thing was not too dry and loaded with blueberries.   I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to stop coming here on weekends..with the added businesses next door almost impossible to get a parking space...add to that 15 mins in line just to order and another 15 (at least) to get your food, it's just not worth it...I like this place but will only come here during the week. P.S. with such limited seating it is really irritating to see two girls taking up a table but not even eating...so inconsiderate!"}
{"text":"Probably my overall favorite coffee shop in the Valley.  Wonderful atmosphere in an inside cafe, inside lounge, and outside patio.  Amazing homemade muffins, scones, cookies, pies, and sandwiches.  Wonderful owners and employees.  Great coffee from the serious (they have a cubano actually written on the menu!) to the crazy, fluffy, lattes and mocha combinations.  Great for a quick snack, or lingering to chat or surf the web on the free WiFi.    Located NW of Higley and Ray, behind Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. Sometimes their food is really good and sometimes it's subpar. And they are constantly running out of food. Restaurant 101- don't run out of food! I like the ambiance of this place, but parking is terrible and the weekends are crazy. Go at odd hours for a cupcake, but until they are a bit more consistent, I can't give them a high recommendation."}
{"text":"over priced for sure. Checked out at T.I - came here for bfast before the road and it was blah- my dad was raving about it as we waited but it was just eh....  i ordered the Fresh Market Skillet- eh- it came with soggy hash browns and eggs that i could totally tell where powdered - kinda disappointing - wasnt salted.. i mean blah"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered breakfast and coffee. I got the TJ and Spanish latte. Both were delicious. My girlfriend had a Carmel latte and an omelette. I don't remember which one. She enjoyed it as well. Everyone was kind and the setting is very relaxing and very clean. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"i think i ordered the \"salmon platter.\" i forgot what it was called. but everything was presented beautifully on a platter. it came with:  -cream cheese and chives  -a bagel cut in half -TONS of salmon -capers -red onions -and tomatoes  whew! all that hard work just to make a lox sandwich! it was really good! but for $13?! i dont think its worth the price...  oh and dont forget to play KENO!! =)"}
{"text":"On the pricey side for your standard cafe.   We ordered coffee, which came on a huge pot left on our table to refill on our own. The \"Columbian\" blend was on the watery and light side. So I was practically drinking hot brown water with cream.   The mushroom omelette was good. It comes with hash browns and toast. The hash browns are on the dry side, which is a good thing because its less greasy. The short stack pancakes tasted too battery so I returned them.   Service was okay, and overall I'd say, it's a good place to eat at least once if you're staying at TI. Otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"I am delighted to have this place within walking distance of my house. It's a great place to have brunch with the neighbors, meet a friend for lunch, or just kill some time while you wait for your cleaning ladies to finish up.  I get iced coffee a lot, and I appreciate the stevia packets nearby since they dissolve quickly. Their chai is very good, more sweet than spicy.   Breakfast is wonderful especially since they added some new menu items like the rosa sandwich with egg whites and pesto. I also love the vegan benedict. They really know how to season and cook tofu properly. The San Diegan is everyone's favorite; I sub avocado for bacon.  Lunch is great too. The tomato basil sandwich is one of the best veggie sandwhiches I've ever had. I often make my own version at home during the summer. The vegan taco salad wrap is killer too. I gave half to a meat and potatoes coworker, and he loved it! My husband and neighbor both love the turkey cranberry sandwich and order it almost every time we go.  They are known for their desserts for good reason. Scones are my favorite, perhaps because they contain an almost lethal amount of butter. The vegan red velvet cupcake is much better than the one at Sprinkles. I'm sure that it helps that it's made by an actual vegan (one of the co-owners).  I was hesitant to try the coffee and cigarettes cupcake, but my curiosity finally got to me. I was surprised how much I liked it. It was like a more flavorful and complex vanilla. I've never smoked so I couldn't taste the tobacco, but my husband said the tobacco flavor is there."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place? If you're hungry in the middle of the night (and you're staying at TI), this is probably the most convenient place for you to satisfy your hunger. Unfortunately, that's just about the only good thing about this place.   In the middle of the night, there is a limited menu with a few breakfast selections, as well as a few appetizers, burgers and sandwiches choices. And as most, if not all, previous reviews have stated, all overpriced. But hey, it is Vegas... and when you're hungry, you're hungry, right?  My friends and I ordered the wings and Clubhouse sandwich. The wings were on the larger side, however, the sauce tasted a little odd. It definitely wasn't just buffalo sauce... that's all I have to say about that. The Clubhouse sandwich was good... and was great for sharing! It comes with a small order of fries and lots of ketchup. Great for munching. :)  Oh... the service? Eh.   Five minutes after we sat down, a woman came by to take our drink orders. She then, let us know that she wasn't going to be our server and that he'd be around shortly. Ten to fifteen minutes later, our server arrived. Normally, I don't have a problem if our server takes a while to get to us... but when he did, he wasn't very happy about it. He was short with us and looked like he couldn't have gotten away from our table fast enough. He might have been having a bad day/night, but really... that's not a good attitude to have, especially when you're in the service industry. (-2 stars)  Hm... I'm not sure if I'll be back. Maybe I'll order room service the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Service was so slow/nonexistent that we left after 15 minutes and a server still hadn't stopped by even though they weren't busy. I would rate the night staff negative stars."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is the place to find the most beautiful, delicious cupcakes in the east valley. What a great way to put a smile on your face: get yourself a gourmet cupcake and a cup of coffee and relax in the rose garden for a nice break.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Rujee is so rude she ripped the food from my hand because it wasn't cooked right I couldn't even finish my fries because she took it off my bill ? I won't eat at this place again"}
{"text":"Normally it's a pleasant experience.  I ordered a veggie omelette that was delivered with a bug in the greens. When I brought it up to the kid at the register he replied with,  \"Yeah, it's because we pick them fresh...it happens\"  I agreed, it does happen.  No apology given though.  I was asked if I'd like something else, I ordered a sand which that never came but my girlfriend had the same sand which so we split it, and it was tasty.  But, mine never came.  I went back up to ask about it and was met with,   \"well we made it\"  Ok great, congrats...but where is my sandwich?   At this point I am HANGRY (hungry+angry).   After some shuffling around the same kid from earlier grabs cash from the register and says,   \"here's your money back, have a good one\".  Still no apology...  From a person who dines out often and is a proud foodie...just offer an apology and ask for an opportunity to get it right.   The food and ambiance is enjoyable, but not enough to make up for a lack of basic manners and personality."}
{"text":"Love the location and the concept! The people are very friendly and the coffee is scrumptious."}
{"text":"I have frequently Joes Farm Grill, last week was the first time I tried the Coffee Shop next door. The selection of items is great! I was pleasantly surprised to have Vegan options. My vegan bagel was delicious ! I'm definitely going back to have this again. The creme cheese replacement spread they had was outstanding. And the almonds and honey made it perfect. (If you are against using honey, that can easily be left out) Only reason for giving 4 stars and not 5 is that the patio lacked enough shade for all the patrons. Being that it's 100 degrees in the morning, some of the tables were in full sun without umbrellas. We ended up having to move a table around to sit in the 2nd-hand shade of another parties umbrella. Which wasn't terrible, but being that the majority of the seating is outdoors, we got lucky we could do that. Also parking can kind of be a pain, with the main lot all the way on the other side of Joe's. The food made it worth it though, so A plus on having a diverse menu for people with special dietary needs. Also having a GF bagel option would be nice as well."}
{"text":"Spacious indoor dining and tables outside by the pool. They didn't serve pho till about noon n we were early so ended up ordering a ham n cheese omelette, though that wasn't preferred.  Service was friendly but the food took forever and a year and a half. The waiter felt bad and comped the drip coffee. Okay place to grab a bite but pricey and not a fabulous eat."}
{"text":"What I like about this lil cafe is that it's the perfect place to meet a friend for tea or a client for a business consultation.  It has a nice size patio with comfy patio furniture and is surrounded by rose bushes. It has a calm, cozy vibe. The small patio on the other side of the restaurant has small table & chairs and is perfect for twosomes.  Inside there is  a back room with leather couches & chairs and beautiful coffee tables made from tree stumps. The food is delicious and you can see the garden where some of the fresh ingredients come from.  I think it's smart that they put a big, square table in the middle of the room as I see small groups gather around it for their meetings. On my last visit I had a vegetable omelette that was pretty tasty. I will definately be going back."}
{"text":"I stayed at TI this past 4th of July weekend and I was happy at the first visit but not so thrilled the second time. First off the in room description says average cost per person is $12 ...um maybe like 10yrs ago cause both times I went my bill was over $20 for just myself. Which was in my opinion WAY too expensive for breakfast. I asked for cheddar cheese on my eggs and it came back with an square piece of melted American on it which i was disappointed with. I asked for bacon well done and it came out not well done. I had to send back my coffee because it was too watery. btw ---this was on the second day, if i had this experience the first day i would NOT have gone back. On the first day I was sitting next to a table of 8 people that were seated and then forgot about. The entire table ended up leaving and upset...that should have been a sign!! Too bad that every restaurant was so damn expensive at TI.....disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm back to visit the Coffee Shop for our spring training schedule..you must stop by here for a badge, cream cheese and coffee...I love breakfast here at the Coffee Shop..great service great food and indoors and outside seating too"}
{"text":"Nice place, nice atmosphere and fare, but then went there on a Saturday morning and they have this annoying yoga class right across from the front patio. Totally out of place and totally ruined the atmosphere which is normally quiet and peaceful, couldn't even carry on a conversation Over the instructor on the mic talking over over again about feeling your body? and then there was the guy flying a drone around to record all this, really? Why would you subject all of your customers to this I just don't get it"}
{"text":"Best iced chai around! Delicious muffins, mine was chocolate chip banana, yummy! Cute store within Agritopia. Nice location and pretty setting."}
{"text":"This was your average breakfast place but far more expensive. For my all American breakfast which included two eggs, toast, and hash browns was $17.95. I added bacon for $2. The food was standard. There was no real reason to be paying this price. I went once and didn't care to go back. Three for fine food, but don't come here to save your money."}
{"text":"Love the Coffee Shop. I stop by here on my way home all the time for everything from a drink to dinner. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but make sure to try a monsoon! Matcha and raspberry are my favorites, but I haven't found one I don't love. And the cupcakes - OMG. Best cupcakes I've had in AZ.   It gets busy on the weekends, so plan on a little bit of a wait, but worth it completely."}
{"text":"tried the the cinnamon roll and birthday cupcake, big fan!! highly recommend trying the red velvet was good too but my favorite so far is cinnamon! Also tried a breakfast burrito it was pretty good but the salsa wasn't and I need so good salsa for my breakfast burrito!! pomegranate tea is great and I tried the coffee of the day and it was my favorite! Wish I remembered what it was :( I just added a little cream myself but it was the perfect brew! This is still my favorite coffee place and now that I tried the food I can say this is the perfect little brunch place!"}
{"text":"I popped in real quick to get an espresso pick me up and much to my surprise found that they were serving Mr. Coffee from Oakland, CA. I like that a lot since I lived there for many years, it's always good to see local shops getting their name out there. The place is set up very nicely with plenty of seating for the entire group or family. I enjoyed talking to the ladies at the counter and they were very friendly as well. Since I only had the espresso, I give them 4 out of 5 stars but based on what I could tell this would be a go to spot of mine if I was local. The price was good for what I got, too.   I would recommend trying it out and also going to check out Barnone across the street from them. There is a brewery, a pizza place and a few other crafty shops located inside with great art and very nice people."}
{"text":"Honestly I love how this place looks. It's so modern with the design. You walk in and it's a chalk menu which makes it even cooler. The staff was friendly but could be a little more outgoing. I ordered a Carmel latte and it tasted so fresh and good. It wasn't too sweet so I was even happier. This place is cool but it's just boring. You walk in and walk out unless you're staying for HW or something else. It just doesn't have a welcoming feel. Add some TV's or some sort of entertainment. The outside seating is nice and I like how they have that. The place was also very clean. So if you're around and wanna walk around and enjoy the environment and have some good coffee this is a good place for that."}
{"text":"My family had breakfast and pho for lunch.  We really like the service and food. Love the American breakfast and Vietnamese pho in one place. They both very tasty and very original. I'm sure I'll be here again."}
{"text":"More than just a coffee shop!  Lovely ambiance on the outdoor patio surrounded by a flower garden or sit inside where it's set up with small tables, a larger community table or comfy armchairs.  Across the road is the farm that grows much of the food that's served here.  Yum, everything is so good.  Baked goods are scrumptious! Breakfast burritos or omelets are delicious with fresh ingredients.  All of the drinks are delectable and made consistently well.   Sandwiches boast fresh baked breads and ingredients.  Most people cleaned their plates!  That's always a good sign.  Can't wait to go back for my morning breakfast date!"}
{"text":"I used to really love this place! But honestly it's going down hill! The food is just ok nothing to do back flips over and the place looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a while. The coffee and cupcakes still kick butt tho!!!"}
{"text":"The service here always sucks. I think old ladies who are rejected as casino waitresses go here to die.  Most of the food is mediocre and meant to be eaten when you are wasted.  That being said, the stuffed baked potatoes are awesome.  And they always cook hashbrowns perfectly."}
{"text":"Lovely place with the best Mediterranean Scramble and Chi Tea. YUMMY!!  Beautiful place to meet friends and take a stroll after or before your meal or snack.  Highly recommended. I'll be back to enjoy the food and surroundings."}
{"text":"I usually don't write bad reviews, but I was very disappointed with the food and service here! My husband and I came here last night (Monday) around 8:00 before going to see Mystere.  I ordered the classic hamburger with cheese (for $16) and their $5 special margarita. The burger was VERY bland! It was under seasoned and overcooked. The margarita was ok. It was worth $5. My husband said his Philly cheese steak sandwich was good, but he ordered a coke which he never received until after he got his food because the waitress forgot. After we got our food the waitress never came back to the table and my husband needed a refill on his coke. We had both finished our food before she came back to the table and my husband had to ask for the refill and for the check. She never apologized for not refilling his coke sooner, just acted flustered when my husband asked for it. Btw, this was not a busy Monday night. When she came back, she refilled his coke and put the check on the table. And the coke was flat. Like it literally tasted like watered down syrup. I thought for sure she would have taken the coke off the bill, but she didn't. AND the coke was $3.75!!! I feel like we would have had better food and service for a cheaper price at Denny's! I guess we should have said something, but I hate complaining when I just want to have an enjoyable time. I understand that we ate at one of the \"cheaper\" places in Treasure Island, but for a $16 burger I felt like it should have tasted better than what you would get at a hospital cafeteria. And for a coke that cost $3.75, it should have been refilled when we still had our food, and not flat! And for a $45 overall bill, the waitress should have at least been friendly. We didn't tip and I ALWAYS tip even if the experience isn't that great, as long as the servers are nice and food is ok. I would have tipped if the coke had been taken off the bill. Also, as we were walking away from the table we saw the bus boy counting out the money we left right there at the table in front of all the other guests! Like taking it out and counting it out on the table! Seriously? Not what I expected from a restaurant in Treasure Island. They need to step it up!"}
{"text":"The food is really good! My husband and I frequent The Coffee Shop for breakfast and cupcakes. I wouldn't say the breakfast and cupcakes are amazing but they're really good and worth the money. If you want to stop by for breakfast on the weekends come early; I'm not the only one that thinks the food is good and is apparent by the lack of seating. Another reason I love this place is because it's comfortable to come with a group of friends/family or by yourself. My favorite place to sit is out back in the \"garden\" area, especially during cool weather.   My only complaint is that the service isn't good. I feel like I'm inconveniencing the staff by placing an order; they are very short and seem preoccupied with whatever else.   Go in knowing that you're going to get good food but mediocre service and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mid afternoon sandwich - green chile turkey Reuben- and coffee. A/C inside, shaded patio outside with lots of greenery. Arizona lifestyle as it should be, short the swimming pool for summer, of course"}
{"text":"This is a great little place with wonderful coffee. I usually go for breakfast and an iced dirty chai tea latte. The crew sandwich is amazing and the side salad has the best citrus dressing (I want the recipe!).   The patio is nice and the surrounding gardens are very scenic.   I have tried lunch here in the past and I would rate it as ok, but not the best. But if you are looking for a quick sandwich, it is a solid choice.   I removed a star because it is often very crowded and it takes a long time to order and then a long time to get the food. Try to come during off times."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. I come here to study or socialize.  If you are coming to study, make sure your computer has a full charge because the only plugs they have are in the back room.  When coming for food, especially at lunchtime, the line is usually very long. Not the place for a quick bite. Their coffee is really good and they have almond milk! I have never been disappointed by their food.   I would recommend the tomato basil or veggie sandwiches."}
{"text":"What's up with all the hype for this place??!   I mean...YES! It could NOT be more true! I gotta admit, I am another fan among your already-solid fan base, The Coffee Shop :)   What not to love about this place? Sleek and clean interior, amazing food and pastries, energetic and friendly staff, and a good variety of coffee drinks to choose from if you just wanna chill by the patio and savor a cup of coffee. This place is perfect for a coffee and pastries date with your girl friends, a brunch date with your significant other, or just some quality family bonding time in general.    So enough said, bring your children, your pets, your grandparents, your foodie friends, your first date, or whoever share the same love for food like you do. There is a little bit of everything for everyone. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Here's a tuna salad sandwich and a caramel deluxe from @thecoffeeshopaz. Not gonna lie, but I wasn't a big fan of the sandwich. The bread was a bit stale and the tuna was a kinda flavorless. Honestly, I think I'd prefer a tuna sandwich from Fry's. It tastes better and it's cheaper I wasn't completely disappointed though cause the coffee was pretty good! Overall, it was alright. I wouldn't order the sandwich again, but maybe I'll come back and try something else?"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE COFFEE SHOP! for a late night!  This might not be the best establishment for food in Vegas, there are plenty of better options.  However, when you hungover and its 5 am and you just want some hearty hangover food this is the spot when you're staying at Treasure Island!  I love the french onion soup here! It's my remedy."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop.  I only gave it three stars because the staff is less than friendly.  The dude helping me out at the register didn't say a word.  He just sat there and waited for me to speak.  I had to lead the encounter and he acted like he didn't want to be there.  I love Joe's Farm Grill and this little extension of it, but c'mon people!  I see Joe around town and have never said hi, but he is always chipper and friendly to anyone willing to talk with him.  I don't get why the staff can't take note."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance! Dog friendly and we love to ride our cruiser bikes over for the perfect morning!"}
{"text":"You know you're a Gilbert resident when you love the Coffee Shop. We live close to this restaurant and I cannot get enough of the atmosphere, service, food and clientele. Whether it's a Tuesday morning or a Sunday, the only thing that wavers is how fast the cinnamon rolls are gone from the pastry case.   The menu is made from local and farmed from the fruits and vegetables on site at the farm- the coffee drinks are made in house and the atmosphere is beyond welcoming.   You can sit inside and visit, read a book, work on a paper, or sit on the patio surrounded by gorgeous flowers and chirping birds and sunshine.  If you come to Gilbert, you better stop here!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located on Higley and Ray in Gilbert, The Coffee Shop has the best omelettes ever. I ususally get something like the Ham and Cheddar omelette.  The potatoes that come on the side are awesom and add some fresh oj and you are set.  It will cost you about $9 but it is worth it.  I go there once a week on Fridays to work and enjoy breakfast.  I will be Friday if you want to swing by and say hi Facebook friends!!"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place and wanted to try it.  Atmosphere is nice, seems like would be a great place to meet and hang out with friends for a visit and meal.  I ordered a breakfast special - a Chorizo, Egg and cheese burrito.  When I got my food, you seriously needed a magnifying glass to find the chorizo.  It was a very tastless egg and cheese burrito. Hubby had the open faced omelet, he said it was okay, but not great. (I had a bite of his, it had much more taste than mine). This is not a place we will frequent when we are HUNGRY. Guy F - you misled us this time!"}
{"text":"This is a really great place for a coffee. However, they don't make any effort to find you when your coffee is ready so you need to keep checking if you're sitting outside."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! The coffee isn't the best in Phoenix but it's not bad. It's the best coffee we have found outside of Central Phoenix.  I thought the staff was nice and friendly. They seemed like local kids.  The food was decent. It was a little bit oily but not bad."}
{"text":"Met friends from out of town here to catch up and was NOT disappointed.  Great coffee at comparable prices, and the fresh sandwiches and desserts were to die for.  I had the lemon and sage Vegan cupcake.  YUM.  The staff is only average - but heck its a coffee bar!    I'll visit again, and if you like coffee shops, you should try this place out."}
{"text":"I liked the food here but my wallet did not.  In Vegas, I was getting over some mild food poisoning from a different restaurant and my bf had a cold so our bodies couldn't really handle going out anywhere too fancy or even out of the hotel.  We definitely did not want buffet food and had already tried the pho in the hotel so we decided to give the coffee shop in Treasure Island a try for some simple food.    My appetite was coming back so I decided to get the fried chicken dinner.  it came with a choice of soup or salad - I opted for the French onion soup (which was a $1.50 extra).  The bf ordered spaghetti with meatballs with the chicken noodle soup.  The spaghetti was edible - nothing terrible but nothing spectacular either but I never find spaghetti spectacular anyway.  The meatballs were very large and it was plenty of food to eat.  The chicken noodle soup was not good though - very cold and salty.  My fried chicken dinner was yummy!  It came with four pieces of chicken, fried sort of southern style.  It also had mashed potatoes and veggies.  The potatoes were yummy..veggies were ok.  The chicken was really flavorful and juicy though.  I saw a lot of other tables also order this and everyone seemed happy.  I could only eat about half of that plate, so maybe the $18 price tag was almost acceptable.  The French onion soup I also ordered was delicious!  A little salty but I'd rather this soup be more salty than sweet.  It was really savory & I finished that bowl clean!  Food is decent here but sometimes you'll wait a long time.  Plus, prices are expensive for the food you're getting but I guess since it's open 24 hours that makes it's better than nothing.  I'd eat here again if I didn't want to leave the hotel."}
{"text":"Loved it!  My first time here and I loved the whole vibe.  It was really relaxed and there was even a barn cat that was just cuddled up on the chair outside.  I would go everyday if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Great coffee .. Very consistent unlike Starbucks... Their sandwiches are also out of this world ... I'm not a big fan of their cupcakes though ... My wife can make better cupcakes than theirs ... Nevertheless, their speciality is not the desserts .. It's the sandwiches and the premium coffee"}
{"text":"Nice and easy place for breakfast. Very good coffee and great options for food. You order at the counter and then find a seat. Both indoor and outdoor seating options. They also looked to have a great assortment of pastries and cookies that were freshly made. Definitely recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"Favorite place ever to take my family for breakfast! I have been here numerous times always get great service and food. My favorite sandwich is the indian  I never regret any of my visits."}
{"text":"It's not really a coffee shop despite its name. It's more like a Denny's because they serve a variety of American food and they're open 24 hours.   The food itself wasn't very good. 3 of my friends and I shared a chicken pot pie which was more like thick chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl, cobb salad, chicken caesar salad, and a quesadilla. The salads were okay, and the quesadilla was very average. Nothing really memorable. But it's pretty dang overpriced. I guess that's expected as a restaurant inside a Vegas hotel.   Service was super sweet though! Everyone from the host to the servers were really nice and always smiling. But all in all, I'd rather eat at McDonalds than this place to get my service with a smile."}
{"text":"Open late, but obviously they have to because this is Vegas. They have lots of types of food, from American sandwiches to Vietnamese pho. I feel like they are just trying to cater to lots of different demographics but aren't perfecting any specific type of food.  Our pho came with withered basil leaves... :( no bueno. The wait for our food was super long, about 20 minutes for only 4 dishes and hardly anyone else in the restaurant.  Contrary to the name, this is not a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Food is good when you can get someone to come help you. So many people not enough waiters. Today it took me having to go up front to see the manager to get someone to come and take our order. You can forget about being polite."}
{"text":"I found out about The Coffee Shop as they were one of the winners on Food Network's Cupcake Wars.  I've got a huge sweettooth so I was excited to try this place.    We decided to have a late breakfast so my daughter & I shared the San Diegan (an open face omelette with bacon, sour cream, potatoes, feta, green onions, cheddar and mushrooms.  This omelette had all of my favorite ingredients.  It wasn't too salty, maybe just a little too oily but the feta added a nice tang.  It kind of tasted like a baked potato with eggs and feta.  My husband had the Papas Grande Burrito (potatoes, eggs, bacon and cheese).  My husband said it was OK; pretty good.  We picked up a Bostom Cream Pie and MIxed Berry cupcakes to bring back to the hotel.  I was pretty disappointed with the cupcakes (the breakfast dishes were better).  Although the cupcakes were moist, they were just average.  Not exactly the \"wow\" factor I was expecting as winners of Cupcake Wars.  But don't get me wrong, they weren't terrible.  Just OK."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The breakfast is my favorite! I love their yogurt with granola and fruit. I also love their breakfast sandwiches. You can customize it however you want.   Now, let's talk about their scones, muffins and cupcakes. AMAZING!!! They are absolutely fresh and delicious!! I love the butterscotch scone and also the blackberry ones. My favorite muffin is their blueberry banana, delicious!!"}
{"text":"My first time walking in with my husband, it was a great atmosphere and a calming ambiance. When I walked up to the counter to order, I couldn't help but to browse at the different pasteries, cup cakes, and sweets they had displayed. As I took a closer look, there were a HANDFUL of flies landing all over the baked goods and sweets. I told the cashier who helped me first thing. All the cashier did was walk over, shoo the flies away, and proceeded to take people's orders. Not only did she not do anything to continue to repel the flies, but she failed to even let anyone know that they needed to be switched out. This is not only unsanitary, but it is a red flag to me that profits off of goods infested with flies is more important than  customer's well-being. I had to warn the ladies who were ordering in front of me to take a closer look at the display. They too, were disgusted and ended up walking out of the shop. Did the cashier or anyone in the back kitchen proceed to do anything? Absolutely not. It is astonishing that they would rather lose customers than to be concerned of the quality and cleanliness of their food. I hope that who ever decides to go into The Coffee Shop that they should keep a close eye on their food and the swarms of flies that land on it. So ridiculous and DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"Love the iced chai, and they have great food options. The energy of the shop is just MARVELOUS."}
{"text":"My husband says \"Yelp reviews are great at this coffee shop\". Let's Go - so glad we did. Good food, comfortable atmosphere- awesome."}
{"text":"I was just looking for a coffee shop from which to leech some wifi; little did I know I was stepping into an awesome cupcakery whose wares have won competitions on the Food Network.  Now sure, the competition in question was Cupcake Wars, another boring baking competition amongst many in the 2010-2011 season. I watch a crapload of FN programming, but even I couldn't put up with 15 hours of Food Network Challenge a week, much less three other shows that are the exact same format with mildly different food as the focus. It's some of Scripps' highest-rated shows, so someone's watching it, or forgetting they left the TV on while they went to go make dinner.   In any case, it shouldn't detract from the accomplishments of Flowers/Cuff, because they made the best cupcake I've ever tasted. It was a cranberry/lemon thing, and despite the large swirl of frosting that matched the quantity of the cake itself, nothing felt overpowered between the sweetness, the fruit, and the citrus. Beautiful inside and out - much like myself, if you were to ask my mother. A damn smooth cup of coffee, too."}
{"text":"If you want Denny's quality food for 3x the price, eat here. I got the ham and cheese omelet which was exactly that - egg, ham and cheese for $15.   bottom line: the food will hit the spot for late night (or should i say early morning?) cravings, but you might only want to dine here if no other options are readily available."}
{"text":"Getting off the plane (very early in the morning), I wanted a cup of coffee and some breakfast.  In the lobby of the hotel we stayed in (Treasure Island), the wife and I decided this would be our best bet to start off our honeymoon together.    This is where things go bad.   1. The service was not as good as we expected for an eatery in Vegas.  The server was a little impolite as he gave us our menus.  The waitress came and gave us so-so service.  She was not nice when I asked her questions about the menu.  She didn't want to help me make a decision.  Instead, she seemed annoyed of my questions.  If I had paid the bill, there would be little to zero tip.  2. The food was not bad, but it was not as spectacular as posted in front of the cafe and in some yelp reviews.  It was a little more expensive than I expected for the food they served us.  My omelet was pretty good.  The size was worth the price, but I expected a bit more.  It being a Vegas restaurant, but maybe, I had expected too much.  That was probably more my fault; if anything.  However, my wife's waffles were not good at all.  This dish was definitely not worth the price.  Too dry and I believe my wife complained about the overly sweetness of the food.    3. The coffee SHOULD be better.  If coffee is in the title, the customer would probably think that the coffee is superb.  However, the coffee was not as good as the stuff I make at home.  Sure, I have both 100% Kona, Ka`u, and darker Italian roasts at home to spoil my tastebuds.  However, I expected a good cup of joe to start off my honeymoon with a soothing bang, but the old grinds the coffee tasted was from, ruined that morning until we went out for dinner later on that night.    Las Vegas restaurants should be more up to par.  However, some places I will never patronize again due to these bad experiences which I have encountered during this trip.  Cheers to you all yelpers.  Have a good one!"}
{"text":"Typical cafe in the casinos. I came here with my parents for lunch and ordered:  -Caesar Chicken Wrap (ok, not exceptional) -NY Steak and Eggs w/ Rye toast (wanted medium-rare, but came out medium-well) -Chinese Chicken Salad (Got the ingrediens, but didn't taste as good as elsewhere) -Buffalo Wings (Too Salty) -Coffee (bad)  Check came out to be about $71.  Wait time: 40 min. Waiting was too ridiculously long!  There's a Pho right next to this place which is better but not 24hr."}
{"text":"The blonde girl at the register was rude. Did not greet me as I was ordering just stared at me, did not say a word and gave me dirty looks, don't care how good your food are, costumer service sucks! Thanks for starting my birthday morning awesome, I'm being very sarcastic!"}
{"text":"what's with all the sad reviews?!?  we ended up at ti after listening to my big bro jabber about leaving downtown and coming to ti.  i believe this is their only spot that's open all night.  they have a special late night menu that they serve from i believe 12am - 6am.  eggs benedict is not served until 6am.  my sis was quite disappointed.  she almost waited to wait the 1.5 hours to get them.  she was happy with the hot coca and whipped cream.    i ordered the french toast (which is something i don't order too often) and i must say that it was freaking delicious.  melt in your mouth type french toast that just mad hit the spot.  they actually give you three generous slices of some sort of thick bread.  i'm not sure if it's the same as the toast that comes w/ other meals, but it's freaking good.  i tasted the french onion soup and true to form it was a bit too salty for my palate.  my bro seemed to enjoy it though.  he also ordered a mushroom omelet.  the other sibs got the eggs, bacon and hash.  oh and it wasn't the measly two strips of bacon.  it was more like a pile of bacon.  from what i heard....it was quite tasty.    so all in all.  we had a nice late night meal after a night of gambling.  the coffee shop was definitely a nice finish to it.  oh and the service was good.  very attentive and helpful....even went to the kitchen to figure out what kind of syrup was provided with the french toast.  that's what i call a good server.    so go visit when you're at ti.  i don't think the french toast will disappoint."}
{"text":"Yes, I do agree.  The service here is pretty bad.  Everyone seems unhappy.  Prices are fairly high, but it is a casino.  Lets talk food.  My family and I were on comp and so we chose to give this place a try over canter's (better place).  We came for breakfast; american breakfast, steak and eggs, philly cheese steak, chicken club, and egg chicken skillet (can't remember all of them).    Food was decent, I don't think you can screw up eggs scramble or over easy.  Grandma didn't like the steak; she felt that it was over cooked and to me it looked like cheap meat.  I couldn't go wrong with the all american, but I do wish that they would give me 2 sasuage and 2 bacon instead of one or the other.  Seriously, for over $10 and you can give me both?  Uncle made a poor choice on getting the philly.  Just looked like stir fried beef, onions, and bell pepper on bread.  Nothing special.  Gf didn't even finish her club, enough said.  Aunt didn't complain about her skillet, but then she hardly complains when it's comp on T.I.   Overrall,  service would really kill you mood.  Back to Canter's from now on.."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast, right before 10:45 AM.  I had to check-out by noon so I was concerned I wasn't going to make it.  First, there's always a line at this place, even though the restaurant has a fire capacity of 500 occupants...  I was seated right next to a bussing station, so there were always people walking by.  It took me 10 minutes to get a simple glass of water, and a bus boy brought it to me.  It was a full 15 minutes before I even ordered; the corn beef hash, eggs, hash browns, and toast.  The food was only mediocre, at best.  The toast was burnt, the hash had too many red-peppers to the point it was over-powering.  The eggs were the only highlight as the hash browns were so brown, everything was crisp, not a soft potato part left.  I didn't bother sending it back because I was in a rush to check out.  By the time I left the restaurant, it was 11:40 AM and I still had to go back upstairs, to the 26th floor, and gather my things to leave.  Even though this place is open all hours, is overpriced, and there are plenty of better places to eat, I might come back if I was in a hurry, only because it takes so long to get anywhere on the Strip.    One odd thing was, they don't do take-out, they make you order room service if you want something."}
{"text":"What you won't guess from the name is that the Coffee Shop is actually on a community farm called Agritopia. The farm has a story and has been there a while. The original stone farmhouse buildings are now used for it's restaurants, the Coffee Shop and The Grill.   For the Coffee Shop, definitely farm fresh and organic, simple and tasty, not fussy. Everything we ordered was very good. This is not a gourmet coffee shop, to me it's more of a farm styled urban café.   And they have cupcakes... I'm a fan of a good cupcake. My shock was seeing that in fact, the lady working the kitchen line, was a face I recognized from Cupcakes Wars. She was very gracious and came around to take a picture with me. I had a lot of fun with that encounter since I'm a big fan of the show and had seen the episode she competed on.  Besides The Coffee Shop and Joe's Farm Grill (which I only saw walking past, separate building, same farm) , you'll see the community gardens, labeled plants growing everywhere, paths to walk on, very nice. They also have farmer's markets twice weekly.  I found the place to be charming, the food tasty, and the people very nice. Go visit the farm for breakfast, sit in it's historical buildings, admire the cool urban garden concept. You'll be glad you did.    Eat well and prosper!"}
{"text":"I love supporting local places like this one. Cute atmosphere, with a nice patio. It's crowded on the weekends (which is to be expected), but the line moves fast. This place is consistently good! I love the San Diegan with a nice cup of coffee. I just wish they had some gluten free baked goods!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in Agritopia, The Coffee Shop can be hard to find.   Maybe that's a good thing.  I found The Coffee Shop because I like the restaurant next door -  Joe's Farm Grill. And when I found out it had free wifi, it quickly became my office away from home (of note, as appears to be typical everywhere else, there can be a shortage of electrical outlets at peak hours. Just club someone over the head and take theirs. A more sophisticated approach may be to hand them a five, tell them to go buy one of the DELIGHTFUL pastries and take their plug while they are at the counter).  The coffee is great, the pastries are to die for and the patio / garden area makes you say, \"Toto, we're not at Starbucks anymore\"."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is my favorite café in Gilbert, near the San Tan Mall. They were featured on The Food Network Channel and won \"The Cupcake Wars\" TV contest. The cupcakes are to die for and well worth the visit. The menu is constantly changing along with the other breakfast and lunch menu items.   The most unique aspect to The Coffee Shop is the location in Agritopia, a farming community, situated next door to the most famous Gilbert, AZ restaurant, Joe's Farm Grill. Joe's is ALWAYS PACKED FULL and it's hard to get a decent outdoor table. All of their menu items are farm fresh and the produce is picked right next to the restaurant. Talk about organic! It's an amazing experience to eat outdoors, next to the view of the farm where the food is grown.   After your meal, go next door to The Coffee Shop for dessert. The only issue I have with The Coffee Shop is that it should be bigger inside with more tables. There are some outdoor café tables, but of course it's just too hot in AZ in the summer to eat outdoors! It's always a surprise and a pleasure dining out. Here is a great Gilbert landmark restaurant to take visiting out of state friends to eat!"}
{"text":"Good place to wait to meet people at Joe's farm gill.  Good ice coffee that's what mattters !"}
{"text":"I stayed here recently for a conference across the street. After checking in we wanted food and decide to go downstairs to The Coffee Shop. We were seated right away and given a menu for the Pho food as well as the Coffee Shop menu.   After having a hard time deciding, I got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries. It was a hefty sandwich packed with flavor. I enjoyed the fries as well. Seems like everyone was satisfied with their lunch.   I didn't get a chance to return after staying for a few days, but I saw other items I would have tried."}
{"text":"This is quite literally the worst restaurant I've ever been to. We waited in line to get seated for 30 minutes when we could clearly see open tables available. Once seated, the drink and food orders took forever.  Our waitress only checked on us one time throughout the course of our meal. So much for those bottomless mimosas! The pho was absolutely terrible. Basically undercooked noodles in hot water. The prices were outrageous. Maybe double what one would expect to pay elsewhere. We came back again for a late night snack (apparently I hadn't had enough punishment). I ordered the BBQ pizza. When it finally came, it was cold. Basically just a piece of bread slathered with BBQ sauce and raw red onions. I ate a few bites and gave up."}
{"text":"Caramel macchiato is to die for! Sometimes it takes a while for a drink to come out but it's worth the wait. I always pair it up with a cupcake. I've yet to try their sandwiches but definitely next time! I do prefer this over Starbucks or any other local coffee shop in town."}
{"text":"So after going on a week long binge consisting of caffeine and Easter chocolate, I decided that I needed a little break and eat something relatively healthy for me.  Being the indecisive little thing that I am, I had no clue where to go or what I wanted to eat.... but thanks to yelp! I decided to check out this place. (Thanks yelpers!)  The Coffee Shop is cute -- there are lots of windows filling the place with natural light and it also gave the place a more spacious feeling. It wasn't too crowded when I went there but there were enough people where you could feel comfortable and not have to worry about feeling suffocated, or even worse, being watched by employees (paranoid, much?)  I ordered the tomato basil sandwich, which also came with mozzarella, onion, avocado, and feta cheese. The tomatoes that were in my sandwich were one of the best tasting things I've ever had. Other than that the sandwich was kind of salty (because of the feta cheese I think?) but the amount of tomatoes they added helped balance the overall flavor.  I also got to try the pesto chicken sandwich, which I thought was even better than the sandwich that I ordered. The pesto was SO GOOD!  I would (and will) order that sandwich next time I am here.   The best part about the sandwiches is that they tasted so fresh that it almost made me think it could offset the load of processed crap I consumed this past week (damn you, guilt).  I didn't try any of their drinks or cupcakes (see: binge) but I do plan on coming back to try them out because they looked really good. They had an interesting selection of cupcakes with plump frosting tops that came in cute names like \"lemon glam\" and \"sweetheart cherry\". Some of their cupcake selections were vegan too!  Thank you for the awesome food Coffee Shop! :)"}
{"text":"Best start to my days and always a favorite amongst visiting family and friends. Can't beat the cupcakes or breakfast! Also a great place to drink coffee, relax, hangout or study."}
{"text":"Love this place. My morning haunt. Great coffee. Amazing food. Get the San Diegan burrito style."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here a few nights ago. It took about 5 minutes to get served and the food (omelets) were mediocre at best.   Tonight we decided to give it another shot. This time we waited close to 15 minutes to get served and once again the food wasn't that good.   By the way, a side of ranch is $1.50 and a side of parmesan is $2.00.  We will never come back regardless of how hungry we are at 3am."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience, my husband and I are vegan and this place has lots of options to eat.  The vegan pho is an excellent choose.  The noodles were tasty and broth was on point.  All the veggies inside and this meal amazing.  Another meal we had was the beyond burger, I had to confirm with the waiter it was not a real beef patty lol.  Add avocado and you have a perfect meal.  Another meal we had was spaghetti with marinara and for an added touch, we replaced meatballs with beyond burger patty.  They need to add this to their regular menu because it was perfect.  All the waitresses were very nice and helpful.  For vegans it's not always easy to customize and order.  Everyone had patience.  Will come back over and over."}
{"text":"Of equal or lesser quality to Applebees and overpriced. Stay away. There is not much more to say, but Yelp needs more characters for it to be a review, so here I am... typing away."}
{"text":"This is a really cool coffee shop / restaurant hybrid. It has the quaint feeling of a local coffee shop with a full service restaurant and bakery menu. There are several other restaurants and shops located next to it in a unique tree-lined area -- it really has a \"farm-like\" feel. I had the tofu benedict and a cupcake (both vegan) to eat and my friend enjoyed the San Diego omelette. The prices are very reasonable and food is very fresh. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Seriously, one of my favorite places to eat in vegas. Breakfast, appetizers, lunch and dinner here, and you can order pho too! The pho i had here was amazing. As was the turkey club sandwich i ordered. Perfection with both orders! The pho i ordered had thinly sliced beef, the broth was super flavorful and had a sweetness to it which I love. The sandwich i got had the perfect amount of high rated turkey slices, bacon, mayo, and came with crunchy sliced pickles and kettle potato chips. Awesome place, good options and you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and boy was it packed. I was surprised to see so many people here before noon in the middle of the week. It's a super cute coffee shop with really pretty cupcakes. I think their breakfast menu is better than the lunch menu. I had the harvest bowl- it was super filling but I wish they gave you the option to have it with poached eggs rather than fried."}
{"text":"Now that I live in Gilbert, I am here everyday! Still just as amazing as the first time I made it here a couple years ago. 5 stars easyyyyyy"}
{"text":"I stumped upon this place after I picked citrus at the local farm. I am so glad I came in when I did as they serve breakfast from 8-3pm on weekends and the crowd came after I placed my order. I can see why as I look over the breakfast/lunch menu.   I ordered a Supreme burrito, as I am always down for good breakfast burrito especially with \"local pork chorizo.\" My burrito came cut in half and I can see why, it's loaded with pork chorizo, fresh eggs, potato, sour cream and cheddar cheese. As I took my first bite I could taste the pork, cheese and potato in one bite! Amazing! The burrito was stuffed with goodness and I have left overs for later. I can not forget the delicious homemade salsa to compliment your burrito with hint of sweetness. I would recommend you try anything on the menu with local pork chorizo on the menu. Thank me later.   The restaurant has plenty of sitting inside and outside so you can enjoy your meal with family and friends. I also saw nook in the back if you need to escape the crowd to study or work."}
{"text":"Love love loved the coffee!  I got a caramel deluxe and it was amazing. The reason for the 2 stars though...in the baked goods case, they had a pumpkin walnut loaf so I ordered it to split with my friend.  When we sat down and cut into it, I took a bite and realized they gave me the wrong item. They gave me a banana loaf and I'm extremely allergic to banana. My friend went inside to explain what happened and they were not apologetic at all.  They just asked my friend what we wanted instead.  I'm happy that I didn't have a severe reaction as I didn't have my epi pen but when it comes to food allergies, they should be a bit more concerned. An apology. Something!"}
{"text":"I love trying new coffee shops and found this one on yelp and decided to stop in. I typed the address into my phone and when it said I arrived I couldn't see it. It's find of hidden off of Ray rd but it is where it says it is. The mixed berry cupcake was delicious and the sandwiches are a good size. I ordered an iced caramel latte, it was good but a little sweeter than I like. The atmosphere is perfect and I loved the outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"This is a totally solid bfast spot.  Though I do think that the items here are one or two dollars too expensive, everything I had tasted good. One thing I did particularly LOVE were their scones.  They weren't as dry as scones usually are, but were moist and kind of like muffin tops. Yum."}
{"text":"It's okay the last couple of times I went in for cupcakes they were not good. I think they are overrated."}
{"text":"Reached here on a whim, trying to find a not so expensive spot while I was in the area. I was pleasantly surprised that they were willing to serve the breakfast items well after the breakfast hours per their menu. The person who took our order was really pleasant and willing to help us pick our items.   I got the Burrito supreme and loved it. Lovely juicy chorizo, potatoes, eggs and sour cream. I forgot to have the sour cream removed and it would've been awesome with some guacamole. It came with a side of salsa. The tortilla wasn't my favorite though. My wife got the Tofu Benedict which she also liked but to my taste the tofu was a little bland and there were too many potatoes on the plate.   They have a great selection of not too expensive coffee.  A must visit and I will eat here again even though it's out of the way."}
{"text":"Have spent the better part of three days here while a friend (who lives nearby and needs to be near his house while we work) developing some Social Media webinar material.  Haven't found anything about The Coffee Shop that I haven't loved.  Have had the coffee (very good), the muffin/coffee cakes, a lunch and now an award winning Boston Cream Pie Cupcake.  Oh, had the Chorizo Burrito the first morning.  Their sweet tasting salsa was a great compliment to the spicy but very tasty Chorizo Burrito.  If I was here I may never step in another Starbucks again..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Coffee Shop! The breakfast and sandwiches are so tasty and fresh. The desserts are amazing and I love the variety. To top it off, the coffee and drinks are great! Plus, the atmosphere is super chill."}
{"text":"Vegan breakfast have always been available to me at this friendly coffee shop upon request, but now they have incredibly tasty options on the actual menu! Their vegan cupcakes are one of my motivational tools, when I need an extra push forward I allow myself one after the goal is achieved.  It can get busy so if you are in a hurry, don't panic at the line, the friendly and efficient service staff will get everyone's order taken and made before you can absorb all the local color on display."}
{"text":"I admit it, I have a Pho addiction, and after a long session at the poker table I was hankering for some!  Even though I know there's a perfectly good Pho 88 it was unfortunately off the strip, and I was already stuck in the TI Poker room.  I'm accustomed to paying less the $8 for a fully loaded meaty goodness bowl of Pho and to pay $12 was a bit steep (well for Pho) but I'm an addict and what was I supposed to do?  So I bit and went in.  It was easily the worst bowl of Pho I had ever had.  The broth was essentially salted hot water, with a bowl of noodle and a few slices of flank tip beef! Where was the meat?  Where was my flavourful broth?  And to make it worse, it didn't come with all my condiments that I'm accustomed with.  Where's the cock sauce (the not so affectionate name for the rooster brand hot sauce)?  Where was the lime and some fresh basil?  Bah.  Should have just stuck to a sandwich or the buffet."}
{"text":"\"This will be the longest you've ever waited for a mediocre cup of coffee.\"  Kind of the best way to put it.  A place with the noun \"coffee\" in their name is expected to serve excellent coffee, at least in the books I read.  Joe is brilliant, don't get me wrong.  I just don't understand the Mr. Espresso beans, moderate machine and undertrained baristaing that occurs from time to time.  Perhaps when he debuts his roaster and revamps the shop, things will be different."}
{"text":"What? They have coffee here? Really, folks, it's all about the cupcakes. BEST. CUPCAKES. EVER.  These little treats are like beautiful works of art (who ever thought you could actually eat sparkles?) and very creative with flavors - my personal favorite is the cookie dough cupcake. They like to use almond extract in their creamy frosting which adds that little extra. Also the cake itself is a bit heavier than your typical cupcake which can be too light and sometimes fall apart - these babies hold up well which seems to also contribute to their flavor.  Be prepared to shell out the dough, though (no pun intended). They won a Food Network cupcake challenge and unfortunately they now have the prices to match. Still, for a special treat these are worth it.  Oh yeah, and I hear they have coffee and sandwiches too, but why bother with those?  One tip: The selection of cupcakes are at their peak at 10-11am. Get there too early and they won't be out yet, too late and the pickings will be slim."}
{"text":"Pros - Open late night, good service  Cons - Terrible tasting food!"}
{"text":"Very average restaurant inside Treasure Island. The name throws you off because it's not a coffee shop and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have American food and Vietnamese food. Again a random combination of foods. The serving size is very large. I ordered a tuna sandwich with French fries for $2 more. Normally it comes with potato chips. I ended up eating only half the tuna sandwich and came no where near finishing my fries. If you have an appetite and don't care for average food I would give this place a try. The service was very nice and our waitress was super friendly and very busy as well. She was all over the place taking orders dropping off food etc. The meal came out pretty quick too, so if you are in a hurry it's an added plus."}
{"text":"A nice alternative to Joe's Fresh Farm Grill.  Excellent place to visit for breakfast or lunch.  Food is delicious and prices are reasonable.  Yes, Cupcake Wars brought them some claim to fame but I think cupcakes are over-priced and unsatisfying.  Shall we have a tea party next?  This is a coffee house with a comfortable atmosphere, if somewhat crowded at times.  The patio is nice on a cool morning or evening.  Like most places in Gilbert that have staying power, your experience will be judge on time of visit.  Service suffers as each place gets busier."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cute as a button and the coffee and food is great. Very fresh.   I have had casual business meetings here over coffee as well as hung out with my kids. Chill vibe:)"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this coffee shop. We've gotten coffee numerous times and the coffee is excellent! We started coming here on Sunday's for breakfast. Love the food. The egg white sandwich yummy. It's called the Rosa which I my name Also. Friday my husband & I went in for lunch, I love the Chicken pesto sandwich so tasty. We will be back frequently, my son loves the whoppie cookies. So tasty. (Try the caramel macchiato so scrumptious . My favorite, iced) my husband likes the Spanish latte iced."}
{"text":"Need to study, but don't want to be in a library? This place is a good one - as long as the sun is still out. I'm not sure if they are just super energy friendly or they can't afford the electricity, but this place is always so dim once the sun goes down. If you have a laptop, then not a huge problem, but if you want to read or study a textbook, just realize it might get a little hard on the eyes.   Oh, you want to know about the coffee? Yeah, its coffee. Nothing that blows me out of the water making we want to drive miles and miles to grab it, but its decent cup of joe that will keep you awake and go down smooth. I prefer the hot chocolate over their coffee. But honestly if it came down to having choose between starbucks coffee and the coffee from here, I would be indifferent. They are best known for their cupcakes, I am best known for not paying $3 for cupcakes, so no opinion here.  This place is spacious, tons of seating and always friendly employees. Free wifi and a really comfy patio area. A really good change up from the traditional coffee shop in terms of environment. And if you have a pimple or you rate a 4/10 on the hot or not scale, just take your date into the back couch room for a nice relaxing chill area."}
{"text":"There is something about his place that I find relaxing and charming. I can't quite place my finger on why, but it's a place I enjoy scheduling meetings or stopping in for a quick bite. Their pomegranate tea is unsweetened and tastes fantastic. I could easily become addicted to it. Ice also had a cooper sandwiches and they were good too. Usually it's filed with people on their computers, but I prefer to step outside and relaxing in the sun. Definitely worth trying if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Best cupcakes in the world. The cherry cupcake is sooooooooo good. They end up at every celebration we have"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this cute little place! It's part of Agritopia so there's lots of plants and foliage in the surrounding area. Lots of indoor seating, occasionally it's busy but there are tables outside as well! The staff are always nice and both the food and drinks are great; I especially love their chai. Try the waffles if you're there in the morning!"}
{"text":"Compared to other 24-hour casino cafes, The Coffee Shop at Treasure Island does a decent job with quick service, presentation and quality of food.  The fruit plate was overpriced as expected, but the variety was good and came with three slices of banana bread.  We stopped here at 5:00 am and our server was chipper and upbeat, quite the opposite of other diners who either had been up all night or were trying to wake up."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have the best mocha monsoon I have ever had and the best coconut whoopi pie - simply amazing.  The atmostphere is just as weonderful, quaint little gem to stumble upon.  A friend of mine brought me here a few months ago for the first time and now we are hooked!  We go all the time!! Fantastic little place, you wont regret going here."}
{"text":"Love this place! The environment is awesome and you can't go wrong with the food here. I especially love to come here with friends and have coffee and a dessert. The salads and other items are just as awesome. They have specialty drinks that I can't find elsewhere in the valley. The perfect place to come and read, write, or just hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Love the coffee and pastries, the lemon basil scone is my favorite although they don't make them as often as they used too. My son's on a very restriced diet so the vegan cupcakes are his favorite. I never been disappointed by any of the lunch sandwiches. I usually go mid morning through the week to meet a friend or just take my Kindle and grab a table outside in the shade (during the cooler months). Nothing beats sitting on their patio with a great cup of coffee and a good read."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly & the atmosphere is wide open. The tables are right by all the traffic in the casino. We ordered a beer & then realized you can do buckets, so we asked if we could just do a bucket and of course that was a big deal. We couldn't add on to our previous purchase. The food was alright but definitely not worth the price. We had two beers each, and we both got sandwiches  with a small sack of chips and all together it was $95! It's convenient when you're staying at the hotel, but you're better off going to the buffet!"}
{"text":"After the Rock n Roll Half of a Half Marathon we were hungry and didn't want to go too far so we ate at the coffee shop, ordered chicken with glass noodles soup, beef pho, open faced turkey, green salad and All American breakfast and the portions were hefty!  Service was good and friendly and my fellow diner said the pho soup was tasty and authentic.  So for some good comfort food in the Treasure Island Hotel, The Coffee Shop makes the grade!"}
{"text":"Best coffee...try the breakfast burrito supreme....amazing!!!  Check out the farm....so adorable!!!"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed... have been here once and even after the girl repeated my order still got it incorrect. Because of that I probably will not go back again especially since the line was long and I had to wait 10 minutes for coffee."}
{"text":"Had the most charming lunch with my mom here. It is a unique setting. If I were a local it would be my go to place. The grounds are so beautiful and the food is amazing. I had the tomato basil sandwich and savored every bite. Topped that off with a luscious strawberry cupcake with decadent cream cheese frosting. Can't wait to go back and try one of the amazing breakfasts and coffee!"}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem! Great place to bring family and friends to just relax and hangout. They have a killer chorizo breakfast burrito and their whoopie pies are to die for. This place is a regular stop for me. Must go!"}
{"text":"Had the Papas Grande and it was delicious.  The only reason I did t give it 5 stars is that we had to sit outside and there were tons of flies.  Little surprised they didn't have fly zappers outside to try and control the flies."}
{"text":"We all know that eating on the strip can be expensive but just for the record, I will definitely not eat here again. Service and food was just ok, over priced by $10/$15 (OJ was $7.50 for a small cup too).  Take a drive away from the strip and you'll find very yummy food for a good price. Best place I found was The Egg & I."}
{"text":"How did I miss this place for so long??  It's right next to Joe's Farm Grill, perhaps I was always so stuffed after having lunch or dinner there I payed it no mind.  However, next time I'll stop here FIRST for some amazing cupcakes.  They have a lot of unique flavors (a lot of them vegan) and all I have tried so far have been very yummy and light.  The coffee is very good too, they have some unique latte flavors.  Fruit loop cupcake?  I'm still waiting to try it!"}
{"text":"I love Joes Farm Grill so I thought this would be just as good but it was alright.    We checked this place out for my friend's birthday. She had heard they had the best cupcakes in all of Arizona and I had to see if it was true. I ordered the berry cupcake for her and I. The cupcake itself had lots of fresh berries inside and the frosting was light and decadent. The cupcake was amazing overall.  The inside of the coffee shop has a homey, modern vibe to it. There are wood tables, fresh flowers and even the coffee bar is made of wood. The inside vibe is relaxing and your typical coffee culture you have come to expect. Plenty of patio seating outside and lots of free parking of course.   Now for the coffee...I am a coffee snob. The coffee that my husband and I ordered was not very good. It was alright but some of the flavors just did not blend well. My husband ordered a cinnamon flavored one and it was terrible. It just tasted like strong coffee with tons of sugar and syrup. I was not impressed and would not go back to get a coffee.   Sadly this place is called \"The Coffee Shop\" and the only good thing I consumed there was a cupcake. I would not recommend the coffee. I'm sure the tea is a lot better and don't forget a cupcake. You won't be disappointed with that. The scenery and the cupcake is the reason I gave this place a higher score."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. First of all, the service was honestly so damn horrible. There was only 2 nice people there. A younger Hispanic man and an older African American man. This mid-age white man was honestly the worst. He was huffing and puffing about everything. He had the WORST attitude. Idk if he was just racist because he seemed to give an attitude to me and my asian family and the Asians family behind me but didn't with the white family next to me. NEVER eating here again"}
{"text":"The food and service we experienced for a hangover breakfast were on point. Not too crowded and they also have keno. Easy option if you happen to be staying at TI."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop has a great atmosphere in a really gorgeous location. The Indio Panini is my personal favorite breakfast item to order. It's comforting and flavorful, but balanced with the greens that come on the side. Ironically, the coffee is nothing special, particularly if you're going to drink it black. You may want to just skip it. Their dessert case is always worth perusing though. Their cupcakes come in fun flavors and they're dusted with edible glitter, which adds something extra memorable."}
{"text":"Initially I was hesitant on the $9 sandwiches but the sandwiches are actually quite big and definitely worth it. The breakfast burritos are definitely worth the price and wayyy good."}
{"text":"very nice setting, right next door to Joe's Farm Grill (previously reviewed and raved about). Friendly, cozy and crowded. Great, huge sandwiches and good coffee. I am picky about coffee though. A lot of places have coffee that tastes good but for some reason makes me very thirsty. Such was the case here, but it was ok. The absolute standout for me was the peanut butter scone. Never had one, or even heard of one before. It lived up to my hopes and I enjoyed every moment I spent eating it.   Added bonus, the fresh dates were out at the farm stand. However, the plastic thing on the wall that was supposed to hold the cash for the honor system was empty of envelopes. I asked at the coffee shop but they didn't know. Said it was a different place. Well, ok, I went back. Stuck my money in the plastic thing. Figured even if someone else took it at least I did my part. It wouldn't be on my conscience. Had to have those dates.   All of Joe's stuff - you're great - I hope you stay in business forever! or at least a really, really long time!"}
{"text":"Whoa! What happened? The service at the Coffee Shop used to be so great. It used to be nothing but friendly, helpful people giving \"service with a smile.\" But today? The exact opposite.  So, to The Coffee Shop employees, in case you don't know this already, this is how it works: when you forget to put in an order so that only one of our meals comes out to us, but the other meal does not even get started until we ask where it's at 15 minutes later...that is YOUR fault. You should apologize; and you should not look at me like I'm being a trouble maker. [I'm still waiting on an apology, by the way.]  And when a customer has a complaint, do not stand there doe-eyed and silent hoping that the problem will just go away if you stay quiet enough. That's not how it works. Instead, address the issue: admit the mistake and correct it. And when you deliver the missing food -- the mistake YOU made -- do not drop it on the table like you're doing me a favor and I'm lucky to be sitting there.  And no, it wasn't just me having a bad day or something. The table next to us overheard our complaints, and chimed in how appalled they were at the horrible service they received today too. In fact, the palpably bad attitude left such a bad taste in all of our mouths, I don't think any of us could really appreciate how good the flavor of the food was. I know I couldn't/didn't.  I hope the owner/manager checks up on their reviews. Because if the service to be expected is anything like what we received today, we will not be back."}
{"text":"mehhh I've had better for less.... I'm talking about the food and service(lack of) Go to Mcdonalds or dennys instead. It's just convenient but then you wait 45 minutes for chicken tenders that are mediocre at best"}
{"text":"This is where I get my gourmet cupcake fix!  Love the cupcakes, lots of unique, delicious flavors!  The edible glitter just speaks to my inner girlie-girl and makes me happy!  The coffees are great- I calorie splurged and had a Spanish Latte on my last visit.  It was the perfect sweet-bitter combination!    I've only eaten breakfast here, but the menu looks great.   I love the atmosphere-very industrial meets antique meets country.  It can get a little loud, but I blame that on the rude people who don't watch their children and scream into their cell phones more than the business.    Staff has always been friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 3/19/17  Honestly I really WANT to like this place because the cupcakes and drinks are good but every time I come here there's always something wrong. Last time I ate a chunk of dirt from my salad because it wasn't washed properly. This time, I found hair in my food. This has actually been the second time I've found hair in the food. I don't know if it's because they are always busy but come on.... tie your hair up or something in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We decided to have an EARLY start to our day and were looking for a place to eat stuff like EGGS and BACON to give us a boost of protein.  We planned to get to the pool first before the crowds.  So we took the tram-thing over to The Coffee Shop next to Pho in TI and the menu was just like what we were looking for. Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Potato, Toast, Pancake.  But then a quick breakfast pit stop became a LONG and drawn out morning with minimal and very poor service by ladies in a very bad mood. It was not even that early! Like, 9am! Come on! They were so bitchy and unfriendly and had the most sour looks ever! I know this is not Disney Land, but do you have to make it a bitchfest so early in the morning???  People came into the cafe and then people who came in AFTER us started to get their food BEFORE us. It was not complicated food we had ordered. And Egg is and Egg really. You just crack it into a pan and watch it fry up and throw the hashbrowns onto the oil and whatever.  The bitchfest was contagious and we started to get bitchy and restless too, starting to join the mood of our servers. When the table that had the baby at it got their food at the same time as us - but had come in the restaurant an HOUR after us -- that was THE LAST STRAW.  We ate in bitchy silence fuming, having waited like 2 hours for a simple meal of Eggs. And the hashbrowns were tasteless and limp. Even I can make better hashbrowns than that.  To top it all off, the waitress LIED on the bill about what time we actually came in the restaurant, putting down a time, like, 45 minutes later.  I exited to the casino (and got hit on by a disgusting drunk man) while my friend bitched it up to the manager.   So we got some discount. But we couldn't bring back all that extra time we wasted sitting in that blah place on the hard chairs in the middle (not even a booth), with growling stomachs and missing swimming pool time.  Another bridge burned in Vegas..."}
{"text":"YEAH!!!  AGRITOPIA!!!  In case of zombie apocalypse I will be setting up my KINGDOM here. After wandering through BARONE and Joe's and the lines being SUPER long we decided to get a sandwich at the coffee shop.  Awesome and cute little place, GREAT CUPCAKES!!  Me and my daughter split the veggie wrap and a couple of beverages from the cooler. I loved the place. They had a great pesto aioli on the wrap that we were scooping up with our chips. ONE SUGGESTION.......with such a great menu, I think they could step up the wrap selection instead of using a plain ol tortilla, I think you guys are better than that."}
{"text":"This is place is in the middle of Agritopia, which is a very nice place.   FOOD - lots of choices. mostly brunch meals. They are very decent  COFFEE - one of the best here in the valley.   SERVICE - real and genuine service. Polite and answers the needs of the customers accordingly  AMBIENCE - very trendy considering that is in GILBERT where everything is made to look feel and look like the great \"AMERICAN SUBURBIA\"  PRICE- same with any coffee shops here in Metro Phoenix. $7-10 for brunch and about $4-5 for a cup of coffee. Average.   RECCOMENDATION- I highly suggest to check this place out. Nice people, awesome ambience and LEGIT food equals GREAT TIME."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite...nothing fancy. Prices are high but the foods pretty good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are good. I had the breakfast sandwich. The coffee tasted burnt and a bit bitter. The service at the register was sub-par."}
{"text":"The coffee shop has the best shiiii in town. Their pastries are so soft and good IVE NEVER had a bad one. Also the cuff cake americano is soooo good. Love this place."}
{"text":"We came here in 2011 and had the best wonton soup ever. Fast forward to 2013, tried the wonton soup based on previous experience and it was definitely a let down, not even close to what we had in 2011. If you remember great soups at this place be careful you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's been unusually cold and it's April!!  I don't mind since I love coffees and teas.   I'm on my way to meet up with girlfriends at Agritopia.  Glad I was unusually  early enough to pick up a cup of Cappuccino at this cool little hidden gem.  Opposite from this coffee shop is the farmstand.  On the off hours they usually have an honor system, depending on what is grown each season.  This time there were bags of oranges sitting on the table outside.   I go inside the coffee shop to find a  couple of friendly young girls tend the register while a couple of guys are busy cooking and prepping in the kitchen.  I really want to try their breakfast one of these days, but Joe's Farm Grill keeps me from it.   I got the last of the coconut cupcakes.  They have about 15 different cupcakes such as horchata, red velvet, boston creme, etc.  Surprisingly, there were not much choices left considering it was only 6:30pm.  The buttercream with coconut frosting was delicious.  The cake itself was supermoist. The cappuccino was a little weak for my taste, but still enjoyable.  Cartel's is hard to beat when it comes to cappuccinos.  The extra star rating would be for the cupcakes and ambiance. I was taking my sweet time when I looked at my watch!  Crikey, I'm gonna be late and holding the sleeved paper coffee cup, my friends would know why."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Vegan Cupcakes = Dee-Lish!"}
{"text":"If only it were closer. Or if only I was. I would marry this wonderful gem of a business and call it a day.   The cupcakes are delish. The latte is as close to on par as I suppose I can ask for. The ambience is stellar. And the line was in direct relation to its awesomeness.  I cannot go often, but if I could, I would.  Oh, and I asked if they could make gluten-free cupcakes. They said they could make any flavor gluten-free, though I am not confident in that, it still cracks the whip on any other cupcakery out there.  Now if only I were rich and well, had a car, I would move there in a hot second. Too bad for me. Good for them."}
{"text":"I love this place for the food and environment. It's also a great place to meet people in the community. Gorgeous outside and friendly staff! Good place to work on my laptop during the week as well!"}
{"text":"Coffee was good. Prices very expensive for small breakfast meals. Service took very long even though it wasn't crowded., overall I would rather go to a Denny's"}
{"text":"Great coffee (latte for me), yummy scrambles and breakfast burritos, and tons of indoor and outdoor seating. So far, this is my favorite coffee shop in the area. Also the prices are reasonable and the staff is really friendly. It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but it's a quiet and cool place to relax during the week."}
{"text":"The taco salad was huge and very good! I wasn't expecting it to be so big and the taco bowl was a great touch. My husband ordered the club sandwich which came with kettle chips. The club sandwich was huge as well, which makes the pricing of both not so bad. Both were close to $20, which is about the average price of any restaurant along the strip. Our waitress was friendly and very accommodating. Great place to go for quick food."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Worst service ever and my order was wrong. The waiter acknowledged it was wrong and basically told me it is what it is. Asked for the manager and he had even worse customer service skills. Came here because it was the only place open at this hour, should have gone to bed hungry. Don't waste your time, just go buy crackers, it'll be an overall better experience."}
{"text":"I thought the food was okay.  We ordered breakfast.  Just like everything in Vegas though, we felt the food was overpriced for what we got.  It's basically a convenience if you're staying at TI."}
{"text":"Well, if you want to stay in Treasure Island and really don't want to spend toooooooo much on food, I guess this is your only option.  Do not try and use your MGM Mirage player's card here!  They only accept the comps that are issued at the player's club!  MGM Mirage casinos are notorious for being un-user friendly when trying to redeem your points.    The restaurant has two sides: one side is American'ish cuisine; and the other an Asian'ish cuisine.  The service is much better on the Asian side, however, the menu is MUCH SMALLLER!  When we dined on the Asian side, I ordered chicken pho.  It was okay to good.  The vietnamese coffee was excellent, but the only way you can screw this up is if you get the coffee grounds in it or if there's not enough sweetened condensed milk.  On the American side (as I call them for easier reference), the menu is quite large!!!  The prices are moderate to high for the type of food you are ordering.  For instance, I think the 2 egg breakfast w/bacon is around $10.  You can go to a \"local\" diner and get the same thing for $6.  Anyway, the breakfasts look great!  The eggs are done to perfection and taste as good.  The breakfast potatoes need a little help and I would say they are bland and mediocre.   On another trip, I got a dinner salad which was very good!  All of the ingredients looked and tasted fresh.  I asked for some things to be omitted on my salad and the server got my order correct!  Kudos to her (I really thought she'd eff it up)!  Though I did not ever try the burgers, fries, waffles, or pancakes, they all looked scrumptious (I was admiring them from afar).  The service on this side of The Coffee Shop is in need of some serious help.  They seem to have enough people working, however, the staff need a bit more direction.  On our second visit, we waited at least a half-hour before our order was taken; we saw two different couples who were seated AFTER us, get their orders taken and food served to them BEFORE we even ordered!  Oh well, life goes on...  Overall, the place is clean with a cozy/inviting decor.  It can be loud at times since it sits next along a main walkway with lots slot machines at a stone's throw away."}
{"text":"2 stars for service 3 stars for food  The Coffee Shop offers decent drunk/hangover food at high prices. We came here after a night at the clubs and had \"hungry eyes\". We were seated quickly and I had my mind on one thing - a sandwich and fries.   Their late night menu had some good options but the prices were ridiculous. $14.95 for a club sandwich and fries?! That's a little much don't ya think? Anyway, it did the job and soaked up all the alcohol from the night. The boy and I shared and the sandwich itself was actually pretty good, but the fries could have been better. I would have much preferred McDonald's fries!   My friends had the french toast and the BLT sandwich with fries and they both said it was good for what it is.   My only real complaint, aside from the prices, was the service. Now, I know at 4 a.m. the last thing anyone wants to do is deal with drunk people, but none of us were obnoxious, belligerent or puking everywhere, so what's with the sass?! When our server started to bring out our food, my boyfriend politely asked for an extra plate. Her response?: \"Why don't you let me bring out everything first before you start requesting things!\" WOW...awkward! It was really rude and unnecessary and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Not sure if I'll return here on future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of my favorite coffee shops in town. I love the vibe of this place and it's a great place to study or do work. It can get pretty busy at times but for the most part it's not too packed. They have seating outside but it's usually too hot because you know, Arizona. However during the cooler parts of the year, it's a great place to chill outside."}
{"text":"Good food great atmosphere. Home made salsa goes great with Papas Burrito.  Relaxing back patio under the trees in the midst of a huge farm. Community garden across the streets   Pastries are made fresh daily and their cupcakes are award winning ."}
{"text":"Had the California club and it was amazing. Also enjoyed the home fries! Love the quaintness of this little shop! Highly recommend it. It has ample parking, outdoor patio, small kids menu."}
{"text":"After seeing the horrendously expensive restaurants at Mandalay Bay, we came here to have an affordable dinner. Not only was it adorable, but the quality of the food was very good. There was a wide selection of Vietnamese pho, staple foods, and rice plates in terms of the Pho side. For the American side of food, hamburgers, taco salad, and breakfast foods dominated the menu and from the look of other tables in the restaurant, people were enjoying everything.   The service was fast, friendly, and efficient. If you're looking for a good value and a good selection, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop has become a Sunday tradition to the ladies in my family. It reminds us of all the things we love; the beautiful weather of Arizona, the hip indoor rustic décor that reminds us of San Diego or Santa Monica, and the beautiful farm outside. We love sitting out on the beautiful patio surrounded by lush greens and flowers, at times it feels like I'm sitting back at my family's home in Michigan.   I typically order the quiche which is fantastic and comes with either fresh cut fruit or a spring salad which is a perfect combination to the fluffy quiche. The coffee is good; I have yet to try a fancy coffee drinks since I typically prefer iced black coffee.     If you are ever in the area or want to try something different, I would highly recommend a stop to The Coffee Shop. If you are ever there on a Sunday and see a group of ladies (we all look alike) laughing, chances are that's us...stop by and say hi!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Vegas hotel diners that I've been to. Service was super slow and it felt like our food took forever. The menu is small and way overpriced. You're better off heading next door to the Fashion Show Mall food court."}
{"text":"This place has so much charm and is delicious. I can only speak for the coffee and pastries because I haven't bought food here yet. I make an effort to try coffee where ever I visit and this place is the best place I've tried. It was their monsoons that won me over (the mocha coconut monsoon). Also, their drinks are priced a lot more reasonably than other coffee shops. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Oh I wish that this place was closer into town ...and even dare I dream in North Phoenix...Joe has a fun style that I really relate too. His coffee shop has many elements that I can't resist ..coffee drinks, great baked goodies , fun vintage feeling decor and a \" farm stand\" out front.   Unfortunately the only time I get to stop by here is on my ventures to The Pork Shop .."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and converse over coffee, breakfast, or lunch. It's a local favorite so be prepared to wait - to order and to sit, especially on Saturdays. But it's worth it! Healthy options, Midwest/retro feel and outdoor seating. Rose garden, farmers market and room for kids to run outside. The only con is that I don't think the baked goods live up to the hype. Overall one of my favorite places & the San Diegan is as good as the reviews say!!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! I love the concept behind it, I love the coffee, food, service, atmosphere, you name it- I love it. They have wonderful seating outside, beautiful gardens, and a 24 hour farm stand outside! That's right! A 24 hour serve yourself farm stand. I work from home and often take my laptop and head over to get some work done. I have always had great service, and it's my go to spot when I have family in town. Everyone that has visited has loved the area and it has a feel that says \"come on in and stay awhile\" Joes Farm and Grill is next door- which is good as well!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Gilbert for a delicious meal, pastry and drink. Yesterday I ordered a turkey and Havarti and added avocado, it was so delicious. I also ordered an iced green tea and it was very refreshing. I was greeted and served by friendly staff and that alone makes experience that much better."}
{"text":"5 stars easy... A friend of mine turned me on to this caffeine heaven. I'm from Chicago but visit AZ often. Every time we visit we make it a point to stop at The Coffee Shop.  The Joe is out of this world and the Bakery items look like they came of the pages of a magazine. The atmospheres is pleasant and the staff is friendly.  We ate there for breakfast was wonderful as we sat outside enjoying the flowers and weather. You cant go wrong going here."}
{"text":"Favorites: vegan taco salad wrap (even if you love meat), bacon breakfast burrito, the breakfast sandwich with avocado and onion, butterscotch and Spanish lattes! There's so much good stuff here :)"}
{"text":"We had a $50 food credit from staying at Treasure Island and we decided to use it up by getting breakfast on our last day in Vegas at the Coffee Shop.  We had to wait a bit for a table but the more annoying part was after we were seated we waited forever for our waitress.  I understand she was swamped but argh.  I guess it would have been less annoying if we weren't in a rush...but we were.  Ha.    I ate my weight in pancakes.  And I am a big girl.  So that's a lot of pancakes.  I ordered some pancake stack that also came with sausage, bacon AND eggs.  Yep.  And I ate it all.  I swear.  Okay, I am lying, I shared the sausage with my boyfriend, but only because he always shares his with me *eyebrow raise*.   I got my own pot of coffee which was a nice touch.  Kind of dangerous because I have this well documented problem where if a drink is in front of me, I can't help but drink it.  Quickly.  I drive servers crazy with how many times they have to refill my water glass.  And so it went with the coffee.  I was so obsessed with drinking as much of it as possible (the goal was ALL of it but that was unattainable) that I used up all of my (and most of my boyfriend's) ice cubes trying to cool it down.  That's how they trick you! They make it so hot that you can't chug it.  But I got around that! Joke's on them!  So the pancakes were yum, the sausage and bacon were good, the eggs hit the spot, the coffee was...plentiful, and then we ran for the airport because our waitress was so damn slow.  Good bye Vegas! Thanks for the last minute chow down!"}
{"text":"1st drunk night in in Vegas we came here around 5:00 AM hoping to get a quick snack before we head back to our rooms to crash.  That quick snack turned into an additional 2 hours.  Our waitress even actually scouted me over so that she can sit down to take my order since she was tired.  For three girls we only had an omelet and chicken noodle soup. How does that turn into a 2 hour ordeal?   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   2nd drunk night in Vegas - this place got an additional two stars for the service we got the 2nd night. Maybe it was because we came around 2:30 AM instead of 5:00 AM. There were no lines and we were seated right away. All the food came pretty fast and the service was friendly and efficient unlike the night before. They even gave my friend a piece of cake for her birthday.   Coffee shop you really picked up your game the 2nd night."}
{"text":"The food is ok...its typical diner food...but they are way overpriced...My husband and I only went here because it was in the Treasure Island which was the hotel we were staying at when we were at Vegas.  But there are so many better places you can go to for much cheaper.  I mean...$12 for a turkey sandwich...I don't think so..."}
{"text":"My cousin and I just wanted to grab a quick breakfast before we headed back to LA. We ordered their 3 stack pancakes with strawberries. It was good, and how I would expect it to taste. There was not anything that special about it, but it was still enjoyable. The only frustrating thing was that when we asked for to-go utensils they advised us that they only had spoons and knifes, no forks. 0_o.... fail. Butttttttt, its ok, we made do and it was fine. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Blah blah blah. Not much more to say. Very attentive staff that wants you in and out!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say to all the lovers here, this place is not that great! I have been to plenty of other places that were better. Especially in San Francisco!! But the girls wanted to try it out. Now my wife went home and made some that were a lot better! And we didn't have to deal with the flies!! Jen! please the Best cup cakes ever????? You need to get out more?"}
{"text":"What is up with all the restaurants closing at 10? I was planning to go have dinner at ISLA in the Treasure Island but we got there at 10pm (closing time) I had a few other places in mind but I called before and they were also closed WTF!!!  This was the only place that was opened late at TI. Didn't feel like getting our car from valet and looking for another place so we settled here. We had to wait in a line outside to get seated for like 20+min. There seemed to be only 3 people waiting on tables so it took a long time to get our drinks, food,etc.  Heeelllooo mgmt, if this is the only place that's opened late and is obviously crowded, why are there only 3 people serving?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Another hipster coffee shop - cute atmosphere right next to Joe's Farmgrill.  Decent regular coffee."}
{"text":"A pretty sad effort from Treasure Island and I will be sure to take my $$ elsewhere, than eat at the Coffee Shop again. Firstly, making me sit and wait for 14 minutes for a table to open up (there were at least half the tables empty). The greeters and servers were third rate, unfriendly, old and bitter. Here is a suggestion if you do not enjoy customers find and an alternate career to service. The food matched the service. Overpriced and below average. A miserable experience."}
{"text":"This is actually my favorite coffee shop to go to! There is always a very nice environment there and the decor is truly unique! The food and coffee are both great! I especially love their cupcakes! It does get a little noisy at times which makes it hard to stud, so I use it more of as a hangout spot than a study spot."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre along with the service. Employees don't seem happy to be working. Very expensive for the quality of food. I had the taco omelette. Nice idea but bad execution. Also had the mocha. It was a powder mix. Spend the same money and go to Starbucks right outside the hotel."}
{"text":"Despite all the low reviews, my meal was delicious.  The BF was very pleased with his simple breakfast as well.  I had the Southern Comfort skillet and it was beautiful looking and delicious tasting.  I ate every bite, along with the buttered toast with strawberry jam.  Our waitress was a bit of a biatch though.  But what else do u expect from a woman over 40's working in Vegas, crabby.  Its typical."}
{"text":"Surrrounding areas are beautiful...Flies inside the bake goods display...tasteless food...overpriced...never again."}
{"text":"3:30am pit stop before heading up to our rooms..  Lack of staff members that night. I believe there were only about 2-3 servers which slowed down the line and food service tremendously.  It was so cold.  Ordered buffalo wings.. yes alcohol snack food is the way to go guys! It tasted good :) while i was mooching off of my friend's french onion soup.... yummmm..  That's all i got from the Coffee Shop!"}
{"text":"Yuuuuup!  So good, we did it again (literally, twice).  Amazing home cooked food with an amazing menu and amazing coffee and amazing experience.  How can I explain this for some of you who don't know me....I love breakfast and I gave The Coffee Shop 5 stars (which I don't do often).  With such a wonderful and helpful staff, the food to energize you for the day and coffee that will make you melt, you cannot pass the opportunity by to visit The Coffee Shop (they have way more than just coffee)."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Their food is great. San Diegan is a must. The chai tea here is fantastic. All their food is great.   One downside is their seating absolutely sucks. If you go when it's busy you are probably better off going somewhere else. People are pretty cut throat there about stealing tables. It really sucks standing in line to order and have all the seats taken from people behind you. There are no heaters or misters for the patio.   Overall I love this place and think it's one of the best places in Arizona to eat"}
{"text":"Studied here for a couple hours in the back on one of their couches. Their green tea is one of the best I've had at any local cafe's; it was a tropical mix, but I think they need to go to the loose leaf teas and incorporate that art. Outdoor and indoor was great. They had plenty to choose from with drinks, breakfast/lunch items, and pastry like items. The only down fall was that their WiFi was only half reliable while there... But hey at least it was free. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food and service is SO not worth the price!  There was a line when we went, and that moved quickly, which was nice.  That was the last upside to our visit.  After we were seated, it took 10 minutes for anybody to come by with water.  And then it took another 10 minutes for our surly waitress to ask us if we wanted anything.  Ummm, yes, that's sort of why we're here, right??  So among three of us, we ordered french toast and a breakfast burrito.  The breakfast burrito was just ok, and the $12 french toast came with a slice and a half of bread.  So after 75 minute breakfast that should have been around a half an hour, our wallets were FORTY FIVE dollars lighter and we were still hungry.  Don't bother with this joint!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Arizona last year. I am a mile or so away from this place I love the ambiance, the streamed music (though sometimes loud for the acoustics), the wiFi, and the food. Oh, wait. I love the Cafe Mochas too. The people who work here are the greatest, and the whole experience is of a nice little coffee cafe where you can get breakfast, coffee, lunch, and dessert, all in one place. My favorite coffee spot since I moved here due to the overall experience and convenience of being so close. Now all I need is a Scooter so I can hook up on weekends for rides.   The food is pretty good. I like the variety, and thankfully they have added to their menu recently. I would still like to see more options though, and if they offered more specials it would be a breath of fresh air. I would also like to see a few salad options. I know I would love to forgo the bread many times and just have a large salad with fresh organic ingredients. Maybe one day they will add salads to the menu. The fact that they add almost vegetarian options is wonderful. With all of the fast food and chain restaurants around, I'm happy to frequent a place that tries to serve healthier, fresher, options.   One thing they can improve upon is the fly situation. The flies do make contact with the cupcakes. If they were to keep the cupcakes in the display sealed, this would resolve that issue. But realize the fly situation is just as  bad at Joe's Farm Grill. It's due to the openness of the buildings, so there's no getting rid of them. But, you can cut down on them making contact with the food by keeping the desserts in a closed display. That little investment alone will put people at ease. Again, I've been to Joe's Farm Grill next door where I had to leave due to the flies. It's those open buildings. The best they can do is cut down by being extremely clean in picking up debris and adding a sealed upper display case so the flies don't have the opportunity to land on the desserts.  As for the complaints about the kids from someone above, there are days that the kids are all over the place, which is what kids do. I don't have kids, so that can be unnerving. Depends on the time of day. It's not like that all the time. Also, this is a neighborhood of families, so what did you expect? Although it's wonderful for you to have this daydream of studying here or doing your business, it's a restaurant/coffee shop. It's going to have noise and activity. Frankly, I hate it when I see the place crowded and find that the students or business people with their laptops have monopolized the whole area though they are no longer eating or drinking. That table you're hogging could be used for someone else who will actually be eating their meal there. So, do your studying at home if it bothers you, or better yet, the library.   All this being said, I still love going here as the people who work there are very nice and always greeting you with a positive vibe."}
{"text":"My $15 belgium waffles had lots of berries.  However, Hubby's Club Sandwich had lukewarm fries.  Chinese wonton soup was good.  Service was ok.  We had a lady who must have been a server for a LONG time.  We asked for red vinegar twice, but we got white one instead.  You go there for the convenience (of not having to leave the casino), but not for quality or price."}
{"text":"Great Vegan Cupcakes and Rich Delicious Coffee  What makes this  place great? the ambiance  The coffee shop provides customers with a peaceful, easy going vibe. It is the perfect place to study or meet with a friend. Outside their is a community garden, which is a great place for a stroll   Highly recommend this place for a Lunch/Breakfast or just a quick coffee fix."}
{"text":"Overall this place hardly deserves one star. The late night menu choice was terrible.  Service was terrible.  In one of our orders (club turkey sandwich) had a BUG crawling in her plate. The manager was very nonchalant about a bug moving on the plate. I would never come back nor would I recommend this place to anyone visiting in Vegas, especially speaking that there is plenty of places near by that has exceptional service."}
{"text":"Pretty good service & food - ate here twice while we stayed at TI. The entrance has two different lines, one for VIPs and the other for the lowly sucky people...like me and the BF!  It's hard to tell which line is which, but don't worry.  Someone may scoldingly ask you if you're VIP and when you say \"no.\" They'll make you stand in the other line - even if you're the only one up there.  It didn't happen to us, but my BF and I were sitting right by the entrance area and I saw it happen.  Anyway, we ate here twice, during our stay.  The first time, was on our first day - I had the Lox and Bagel, which was very good - the smoked salmon was cut pretty thick and there was more than enough cream cheese for my bagel.  My BF had some sort of fritata thing that was pretty good.  Our second meal here was a shared clubhouse sandwich which was very much needed after a night at PURE. It was good, or we were drunk - but we ate it up!  We also ordered room service twice, which is where the food comes from.  We had to get room service, after arriving back from our overnighter to Disneyland and the lines for both the Coffee Shop and the buffet were crazy long.  BF got the Prime Rib (whaaaaaat?!) and I got a Veggie Burger, mainly because it had avocado on it!  The food came in about 30 mins (which we were told it would be that long), the man that delivered the food, was very nice - setting up the table and what not.  Our food was good - the prime rib was huge!  So was my Veggie Burger - it was good though!  The other time room serviced was used, was after a night at LAX.  I didn't want anything to eat and passed out while the food was being delivered.  The burger my BF ordered was supposedly good, but there was a lot left over when I woke the next morning!  Haha..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Try their red velvet cupcakes to die for! As for mom and pop and not every Starbucks on every corner this is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I was starving on a Sunday night, and everything else at TI was closed.... so this place was my only option.  The night before, I had a carrot cake from here. It was alright, but I expected something better for a $7 carrot cake. The desserts at the Aria and Bellagio brunch buffet tasted much better than the carrot cake.  Anyways, I ordered a french onion soup and my boyfriend order a mango smoothie. It took half an hour for the soup to come out, and they still did not bring out the mango smoothie... My boyfriend asked to cancel the smoothie and the waiter said \"it is done, we are looking for a glass for it.\" My boyfriend and I were confused.... is it that hard to get a glass? in a casino? where drinks are served EVERYWHERE?  one star for the french onion soup... it was okay, a little bit too salty though."}
{"text":"This place was really disappointing.  I ended up eating here twice because I had bad jet lag and it was the only thing open so early.  While the service was fine they food was bland and overpriced (expect $20+ for eggs an a cup of coffee)   The toast was burnt black both times I ate there, the second time I didn't even bother sending it back.    AVOID wait for the cheaper Buffet to open"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, super rude waitresses. The cappuccino was terrible, apple pie was good but I can't get over the unbelievably rude staff. I was hoping to come back the next day to try their pho but there goes that trip. So not worth it."}
{"text":"The breakfast was great here. A little on the pricey side though. The Mushroom omelet it delicious. $14.00 for an 8 oz. orange juice is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The cupcakes!  Oh, the cupcakes.  I frequent Joe's but always passed over this place.  I work at a coffee shop so I just wasn't interested.  I'm so glad I stopped in...  the red velvet cupcake was to die for.  Seriously.  When I think cupcakes, I think airy and light... super sweet.  This one was dense.  Every bite made me so happy.  My little sister & I split one... I really didn't want to share, it was that good & rich.  I also had a Spanish Latte... which was delicious.  I'm sort of an annoying coffee snob so I was surprised that I liked it so much.  Yum."}
{"text":"Very convenient when staying at TI. The food was good, fast, and the service was pretty good as well. But the cost is ridiculous. 18 dollars for a ham and cheese omelet? No. I'll walk down to Denny's for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with a friend here today. Cupcake game is on Point!! (And Yes cupcakes are an acceptable breakfast food). After seeing this place featured on cupcake wars and being a die hard sugar feen, I knew I had to try this place. Beautiful landscape, friendly service and breakfast ( had to get some eggs to balance out that sugar) was yummy. There was a long line, not surprising for a Sunday morning, but it moved pretty quickly. It's a bit far of a drive for me so probably won't be here on a regular basis but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love coffee. I love coffee shops. My secret dream (not so secret now) is to one day have a coffee shop of my own. The Coffee Shop, across from the Agritopia gardens and Joe's Farm Grill, is what I aspire to.   The coffee selection is vast and everything I've had tastes delicious. And if you, dear reader, do not like coffee and feel that one cup of coffee is indistinguishable from another then you would be very wrong.  Some establishments are very capable of making bad coffee. However, and thankfully, not The Coffee Shop.   While I'm not the biggest fan of sweets I would still recommend partaking in one of the beautiful cupcakes offered here. Did I mention they are award-winning? Cupcake creators, Jessica Cuff and Jenna Flowers (sisters), won Cupcake Wars.   I'm a creature of habit and so you'll find me sitting in one of the retro couches with my laptop, sipping a Spanish Latte and noshing down on a Tomato Basil sandwich (Mozzarella, mayo, tomato, basil, onion, avocado, feta, and Italian dressing on 9 grain bread)."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to stop here because of the few vegan items on the menu my wife was able to eat. The ambiance was great but man the Flys all over the cookies and pastries. I saw three Flys having a picnic on one of the cupcakes in the window at the register, I watched Flys land on every single item, NO covers on the trays! Maybe the regurgitated fly saliva is the secret ingredient on the sweets, but for a group that made to to a TV show this mistake is novice. I had the chorizo omlett it was over salted and the cheese wasn't melted. My wife enjoyed her tofu scrambler. The waffle that came for our son had previous burnt waffle residue all over it. Come here to pop open your laptop and take advantage of no table service which equates to no one bothering you while you sip coffee and hide from the sun."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times and always liked the atmosphere.  However, the coffee has really gone downhill it seems.  Not sure if the beans are over roasted or the baristas just don't know what their doing.  Incredibly bitter coffee drinks during the last month or two.  Go to Cartel is you want to see what it should taste like.  The baked goods are tasty but they always have a serious issue with flies.  Get a handle on the flies please.  It's just disgusting, especially with cupcakes sitting out in the open."}
{"text":"We were craving steak and eggs and considering it was new years eve, it was hard to get from 1 side of the strip to the other side especially since it was like 40% outside at like 1a.  So we just figured, let's go eat at TI since they had to have a place that serve steaks and eggs.  Yes, they do but it was like $19 bucks.  No $5.99 deal here.  Yes, the prices on the menu were pretty pricey.  That's why I stuck with the burger, which was a great choice since it was huge (the patty didn't even fit the bun since it was huge) and the fries were really yummy.  They did forget my ranch sauce but that's fine since I just used the ketchup/pepper sauce mix instead.  Friend ordered the regular eggs, bacon, hash browns, which were filling to him but of course, was a little pricey.  It didn't help that the restaurant was next to the pho place since going to the restrooms, you can smell it and we were thinking about changing our minds and leaving but didn't.  Service was good when we went and since it was open 24 hours, that's a plus especially with huge portions."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe. Love the patio area. Ordered the coffee cake for my son & the bacon/cheese/spinach/mushroom omelette with a side salad. Plus a triple latte. Food was delicious and the coffee was perfection. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"*note, sleepless night, just finished my first pot of coffee, so this review might suck*  Hard to find, no sign visible from the street, most people rush past ignorant of it's existence... Even my Sons family who had lived here a year before us had never been there, and he married a coffee person.   Welcome to my \"Third Place\" I make a fine \"cuppa\" at home, but a day I don't stop by here is a day that I feel a lack in my life.  By far, my favorite coffee house in years, and here it is in Gilbert Az?  Really? Here? Thank you Starbucks, for convincing the Masses that paying more than a quarter for a cup of Joe was acceptable, even mainstream!   Lovely space, well decorated, by a person with taste, flair and fun, NOT by a committee or a panel or by customer survey. , lots of wood, with a sitting room in the back for your lazy hanging out needs.   Ratty recliners? Not here, Nice... VERY nice leather chairs and sofa with driftwood tables scattered about. Nice artwork on the walls, mixing family photo's, nature photography with understated rock and Roll pictures. (having a pic of Jim Morrisons grave is cool, having a UNPRETENTOUS picture of Jim Morrison's grave is worth a star of its own, there is a fare farmers market out front, but for myself, I like to park in the rear and walk through the garden and patio... It's a oasis amidst the sprawl, the explosion of colors and aromas are a extra treat that shouldnt be missed.  This family understands that the atmosphere, the music, the creation and integration into the lifeblood of the community is what makes a coffeehouse so effen awesome. and effen awesome it is!    And probably most importantly... full of the exact friendly faces you need when getting your java on.   Homemade sugar goodness is available. It's the sort of thing that one dreams coming from your own kitchen, but with a tad more color and odd combinations (Coffee and Cigarettes cupcakes anyone?), to intice you in. Displayed in the front case, drawing you in like a moth to a flame,  like Teri Garr in Young Frankenstein... wholesome goodness you want to introduce your Mom to, yet you know it's soooo bad for you... It's gonna kill you, but your urges make it impossible to say no.  *ahem*  Did I mention awesome cupcakes?  Oh, I guess I just did.  The \"real\" food is quite wonderful as well, and worth the trip on its own, you simply cant go wrong, the open face omelet is magnificent, sandwiches quiche, burrito's etc, all normal food, but with a flair and style that make every bite full of extra-awesome.   One downside... success.   Alas, they were discovered and won a much deserved \"Best Of\" award for Phoenix, since then they have had to hire more  people and the family has had to move into the kitchen to keep up.  The service has not diminished, the only downturn is has been in my beloved coffee.  they still remember my families order, but sometimes its not as good as it was, and I view that more as a sign of how much they spoiled me before than anything else.  Business is booming, and they couldn't keep up so they had to hire. It's normal that new people need to be trained, and that any amount of training will not equal years of experience. As other coffeehouses fight and cut corners in these tough times, it says a lot that The Coffee Shop is growing and healthy.   Still, with that all said, this is my favorite coffeehouse in years,   This is a perfect companion to Joes Farm Grill next door. (many reviews on Yelp and elsewhere) Together, they are reason for my Bride and I to want to move to the Agritopia subdivision they are a part of, just to be able to walk there in the morning, along the tree lined streets (rare around here in a work of cactus and ... dirt)"}
{"text":"We were staying at TI during our recent visit and we went here for breakfast purely for the convenience of it. We were looking for vegetarian recommendations and the wait staff did their best to give us suggestions and were able to get the chef to make a simple sandwich with cheese and tomato for my parents who are vegetarian. We ordered pancakes, a fruit bowl and the mushroom spinach omelette. Everything was tasty but nothing spectacular. While the wait staff was helpful in picking the food, they seemed to forget us when they had to ring in our payment. It was ironical as the waitress had provided our check quickly saying that she wanted to make sure we could go out quickly if we were in a hurry to start the day off. Overall, average experience"}
{"text":"It is certainly no secret to anyone who knows me, reads my blog, or follows me on Facebook or Twitter, that Im a foodie at heart and will go to great lengths to try new restaurants, dishes or types of cuisine I've not previously experienced.  All of that having been said I have a HUGE food crush on a little gem hidden in Gilbert, Arizona at a place called Agritopia, I'm speaking of course of \"The Coffee Shop.\"  With such a simple name you would be tempted to assume this was a mere coffee shop slinging run of the mill or even above average coffee drinks and you would be WRONG.  While The Coffee Shop does in fact serve up coffee drinks as expected, it is not caffeine which drew me in or keeps me going back.  Lets begin with how I found them and what has brought me to today.  A few weeks ago Joe's Farm Grill was having their 5th Annual customer appreciation day (they served in the neighborhood of 4000 free cheeseburgers but more on that later) and trusty pal Mikey and I dropped in to have a burger and fries.  As we were leaving, I decided I wanted to stop by The Coffee Shop (which is on the same parcel of land) to see what It was all about. Upon walking inside, the salivation began.  There, arranged before me was just about the most mouthwatering display of cupcakes and whoopie pies I have ever seen.  The first thing that caught my eye were the Coconut creme whoopie pies, seemingly very plain but with the promise of greatness if done well...and they were!   These Coconut creme whoopies are just about the best things I have ever eaten (and Ive eaten a LOT).  Unlike many of the whoopie wannabe's I've eaten in the past, the pastry chef here achieved the perfect balance of sweetness, moisture and density with the most pleasant, light crunchy outer texture.  So flavorful was the shell that I was almost taken aback by the creme filling that was obviously made with absolute care and devotion to the craft.  Simply incredible (I feel like there should be a new Food Network show called \"Whoopie Pie Wars!\")  On to the next bit of tastiness in the form of a tray lined with cupcakes whose sign read \"Chocolate chip cookie dough,' YES please.  They looked simple, well decorated but not overdone and I was keen to try one. No flaccid, tasteless frosting here, there's butter creme on that there cupcake.  Sprinkled with chocolate chips and what looks like chocolate Disco dust was the best tasting buttercream I can remember having eaten.  They've somehow been able to create the essence of cookie dough in cake form, a bit of gooeyness, great flavor and yes, i'd eat a whole bag of them. The PB&J cupcake found its way into my mouth next and took me back to my Grandmothers kitchen with her homemade bread, peanut butter and preserves only BETTER (sorry Grandma), it was deliciously dense, the peanut butter buttercream (say that 5 times really fast) was sweet, creamy and perfectly accompanied but a little dab of jelly on top (along with a generous squirt in the middle of the cupcake.) I highly recommend this one.  I did grab a few other cupcakes before lapsing into a sugar induced coma including cake batter, coconut and a strawberry one I got pictures of and ate but whose clever name I cannot remember (terrible journalist...oh, wait, as a Blogger I admire recently wrote, I'm not a \"professional journalist!\").  Everything i've had so far has caused me to make the 40 mile trek from home to The Coffee Shop for a treat I just can't find anywhere else in the Valley.  If you desire a creative, perfectly made treat, get into your car and make the trip from wherever you might be to THe Coffee Shop at Agritopia.   Check out the Chefs responsible for the creations I've mentioned and more on their recent winning episode of  Cupcake Wars on the Television Food Network."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place, but I am continuously dissapointed.  I can not understand how a coffee shop that has a bakery can never have baked goods at breakfast.  This morning the have about a dozen cupcakes, not one was chocolate.   The only other options were their mini loaves(think muffin flavors in loaf form).   I asked what the cookies were, the server replied those are scones.   Have never seen a flat scone.  They offer a menu item called the Yountville.   I always order it burrito style.  Side note to that, it never comes the same way twice.  Sometimes I am charged for burrito style, I'm ok with that, sometimes I am not.  Sometimes it comes with mixed greens sometimes it doesn't. My favorite..mixed greens come with dine in but not to go???  Today I was informed they can only do that when they are not busy.    I have given them multiple opportunities,  I have called but the phone just rings, last visit I left a note asking to speak to someone, no one called.    In fairness, it's a great environment,  good coffee and love it being neighborhood.   Maybe I just don't understand their business model but I'm on my way to the new coffee shop down the street."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Great ambiance amongst nature We had a veggie omelet & rosa breakfast-wich. Would recommend both. Comes with a nice side of fresh salad.   OJ was delish. Not sure if it's freshly squeezed but we liked it.   Would come back next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"Have been literally coming here for years. Always loved the owner Jessica Cuff and her sis. Well i have been in about three tomes in these last months, bringing new people with me each time. Again, the staff seems like they are doing you a favor by serving you. Great food and drinks. So its sad. But i thought at least the owner was nice. But now even she seems unfriendly and sour when I have said hello. Maybe the attitude is pervasive? I don't know, but this place needs a new vibe of the warm friendlies. Customer service is everything, not hipster snob..... Too bad. Great little concept, great products. Maybe they are all just really burnt out or bored? I dunno but it definitely is sad to see the change. You'd think if you'd been going somewhere since day one they'd be excited to see you????? Adios coffee shop. There are too many other places with less attitude."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the morning for a coffee and a few hours later for a sandwich for lunch, all was great! I just really wish they would keep the kale and quinoa bowls as a healthy option for lunch! Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"No complaints here. It is your basic diner in a casino.  I got breakfast (pancake tower) and coffee. It came out fast and hot and tasted good.  I thought our server was very attentive and friendly.  They sat us at the back near the windows so we could look out at the pool, which was way nicer than the casino seats up front.  It worked!"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience here. Food is fresh and light, the artisan pastries are fantastic. Kid friendly and comfortable. Usually a big line but they are on their game and move it fast as well as get food out fast. A nice change from the usual big chain manufactured food joints all over the valley."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local businesses! Great coffee and food. Perfect atmosphere for reading or working. Dog friendly patio too."}
{"text":"Okay, it's official... I'm dropping out of Journalism school & opening a cafe! I fell head over heels in love with this little gem back in April when my mom&I stopped in for coffee on her birthday. I'm a total Starbucks junkie (Gold Card holder since 2010, baby!) and frequent it on the daily, so I really am skeptical when it comes to getting my caffeine fix anywhere else. However it is safe to say that The Coffee Shop makes the BEST dang chai that has ever graced my perfectly glossed lips, Y-U-M! But the loveliness sure didn't stop there. I couldn't believe my eyes as we walked outside to a patio enveloped in a gorgeous rose garden!   I took my mom back for Mother's Day & one of the adorable waitresses told me it was supposed to be the busiest day of the year. There were 15+ guests in front of me in line, but of course I was willing to wait. I ordered skinny soy caramel macchiatos for the two of us, as well as a strawberry scone & blueberry white chocolate coffee cake. My mom loved her pastry (the coffee cake) but my strawberry scone was really salty :( I'm positive that it was just a recipe fluke because of the Mother's Day insanity, and a little salty scone will not stop me from a 5 star review!"}
{"text":"Unless you're desperate for Vietnamese wannabe food on the strip or don't know a better hangover cure than pho, come here. Otherwise, treat yourself a trip to Vegas Chinatown for better pho with cheaper price!   Location (4): This restaurant locates inside Treasure Island. It's right by the path to the lobby and concierge. The restaurant is spacious because it's a joint restaurant between the Coffee Shop with American cuisine and the Pho shop with Vietnamese cuisine. However, the Pho menu isn't available until 11am. This restaurant is the only restaurant on the strip that serves a full menu of Vietnamese food. If you want to have pho at a buffet, I know the Bacchanal has it!   Service (2): If you stay at Treasure Island, you can order food from this restaurant and they would charge some fees for it. Inside the restaurants, most waitresses are hnmmm... not the friendliest type of people! I once saw a waitress pouring water and hot tea on the table wetting the guest's Iphone. She walked away with a bad attitude and never came back to help the guests clean... I was lucky that I was not that girl who had to go through this. Precaution: If you want to have hot tea, they will only serve one teapot per person and give you an attitude if you ask for an extra cup to share with your loved ones. Who does that!? Well, they do :(  Food (2.5): Since the restaurant offers two menus, you can order whatever. For breakfast, we ordered the chicken wonton soup from the Coffee shop menu since pho isn't offered until 11am. Overall, it's edible. For dinner, we tried the beef noodle, rice dishes and the chicken curry noodle. The beef noodle was the ONLY legitimate dish out of all the dishes we tried. Cos they charge around $13/beef pho, the size was HUGE! You can easily share among two people. With the rice dish, their marinated pork chop is not very good... I'm sorry but their attempts to make Viet food doesn't deserve the price they charge me."}
{"text":"More of the same... What ever has happened to America? We don't even need to talk about the price. Assinine. What a bunch of crap. This is Las Vegas is falling on deaf ears here.  The food was horrific. I have never in my life had such horrifically bland eggs. We both ordered omelettes.  How one can screw up a ham and cheese omelette is beyond me. I never thought it was possible until I ate here.   I am done with this one. The food was absolute shit. I don't eat at McDonald's. Haven't in 16 years. I will go there before I eat the shit this place produces."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome cupcakes. Great location. The food is to die for. The cupcakes are amazing. You just bit into them and it's creamy. The bread in the cupcake is just right. I got a tuna sandwich. Soo yummy. I recommend this place if you love cupcakes and mellow atmosphere. This is your place. Did I mention their cupcakes won cupcake wars on the food network. Everything is just amazing here."}
{"text":"\"This girl's here to say.. with some luck and love life's gonna be so sweeeeeeeeeet!\"..   I was actually surprised.. based on the name you'd think some big haired red head would scream out \"Kiss my grits!\" at anytime. Not at all! Its actually kind of romantic in there sans the dead animal head on the wall. Its cozy and a great place to have a cup of coffee and a sweet snack.  They make desserts like your mom would have made.. cookies, brownies and fridge pies.  Ah, I forgot, they don't use those click click turbo-spresso machines here.. each pulled espresso shot is hand packed and is very potent.   If it were closer to me in Scottsdale I think me and the Mr would hang here all the time.. but its \"country, when country wasn't cool!\""}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for coffee and sweets after enjoying a nice breakfast at Joes Farm House. As we walked in we were overcome by the delicious coffee aroma! It was my moms birthday so she picked out a beautiful looking expresso cupcake. I asked the women working the register what I should get and she picked out a coconut cookie thing, I don't really remember what it was called. But it was GREAT. Coconut is my favorite and it also had chocolate chips in it! I also order some chai tea. It was so lovely and refreshing!  All in all, this place is a perfect for a nice, relaxing morning with a cup of coffee and tasteful pastry."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and you're at Treasure Island, make this place your LAST choice! First of all it's way too expensive for what it is. $16.00 for a B.L.T? Are you serious? So I ordered a cheeseburger. It comes with lettuce, tomato, two burgers and fries. I was expecting the waitress to ask me how I wanted it cooked but she didn't. When I asked why, she told me that they don't ask anymore because the pattys are so thin they always come out well done. When I got the burger it was tasteless...salt, pepper, ketchup...nothing helped. So I finished my $4.00 small glass of Pepsi and left. Never again! Totally should have gone to Gilley's instead!"}
{"text":"REALLY impressed with this place.  I showed up on a weekday around 10 and there wasn't a place to park and a long line.  I highly considered coming back another time but really liked the look and wanted to try it out.  The patio is awesome with tons of shade and seating.  The line moved quickly and I grabbed a great iced coffee and the basic American breakfast.  Every bit of the food tasted crazy fresh and was perfectly cooked.  I'll be back...frequently.  Shudder to think of what the place looks like on a weekend though.  Worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, I have tried nearly every cupcake place in the Phoenix metro area and this place takes the cake..no pun intended.  It puts Sprinkles to shame.  They are not too sweet and the frosting is perfection.  I have a hard time eating one, I always have to order more.  There are two cupcakes that are worth the trip to Gilbert, the rosewater and raspberry and the lemon lavender blueberry.  They will be the best cupcakes you will ever eat, I can assure you.  The owner doesn't make these two everyday but if you call ahead she will make them for you the next morning.  I'm not as big of a fan of the vegan cupcakes they make, as they can sometimes be inconsistent, but the traditional cupcakes are D-lish!  I always order a pomegranate iced tea to accompany my cupcakes as well."}
{"text":"Nice little spot....they serve breakfast all day! so i was just in time when i woke up t 11 am ;)  Noticed the prices were a tad bit higher than what im use to paying..but i know they were gonna be good sized portions...and they were!!! The Service was pretty slow....and it took awhile for us to get our food..but its all good.  My plate was Big and soo good, three of us got teh same plate, i forget what it was called, but its basically a Italian Skillet...i dnt know about a 6 dollar large orange juice, thats the size of a small though."}
{"text":"It is such a cute place with great coffee! However I was not impressed with the food quality. Also we were not aware we could have fruit or greens as a side. We received broken Ruffles potato chips instead. The bread was also very hard and there were a lot of flies."}
{"text":"Ew. There's always a blonde girl working in the kitchen with her hair down and I found a piece of hair in my food. I'm sorry but that's just gross. Also there was flies everywhere. The place has potential but needs to work on a few things"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Tried this place for the first time and ate their vegan cupcake (I'm a vegan)-was so impressed! I'm definitely coming back to try their chai latte.. and hopefully in the near future, they will have a vegan option on their breakfast and lunch menu because it is so close to where I live!"}
{"text":"I actually thought this place was okay.  Vegas is actually pretty reasonable and not crowded and you can get good/decent service at most establishments when you run on business time rather than on party time.  I ate here recently while staying at TI during a work trip (seriously...people do go to vegas for reasons other than partying).  Anyways, my boss and I stopped in for breakfast before checking out on our last morning.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The portions were big, but not outrageously so. Good value (of course). Not too greasy. Above average diner food.   The boss had french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast came with all the fixings - powdered sugar, syrup and butter.  Boss-lady enjoyed her morning heart attack meal.  The waitress only flinched once when she asked for MORE powdered sugar to accompany the already powder-white french toast.    I had a standard 2-eggs, bacon, hash brown and toast meal.  Everything was pretty good for what it is. It was surprisingly (pleasantly so) not overly greasy. I was pleased to find my scrambled eggs were fluffy and not over-cooked, and not covered in grease. The bacon was also crispy and not too greasy (I wonder if they are actually cooking their bacon in the oven and letting the fat drip off).  Toast was standard. Nothing was overcooked which is surprising in this day and age of hypochondriacs and under-developed food palettes. The coffee was a tinge stronger than one would expect.  Prices were fair (although my boss did complain that her side of bacon was about $8...but she did get like 6 or 7 pieces of bacon with that order...which seems fair since most places charge $2-3 for a side of bacon with 2 pcs).  The service was good. We never had to ask for coffee refills. Out waitress was nice enough.  She wasn't speedy but wasn't slow either. No complaints here.  The place is decent and convenient if you are staying at the TI or are in the TI and happen to be hungry at that moment. There's no reason to go out of your way to eat here but it will do when you need a bite."}
{"text":"I crave their iced soy lattes, I dream about them, I wish everywhere else made them as spectacular as The Coffee Shop, and I wish even more that there were even more of these places (for my convenience of course!).  I would go here every single day if I could.  I love everything about this place, the atmosphere, the drinks, the everything.  Ok now I probably need to get in my car and go get some coffee...."}
{"text":"I loved The Coffee shop especially knowing everything they sold was fresh produce.  I ordered the turkey cranberry sandwich and it was phenomenal. The red onion on it gave it an unusual but wonderful kick. Atmosphere was great and would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Being winners of the Cupcake Wars, I had to try this place.  I had their lemon cupcake and it was very yum!  I also had their chocolate mint whoopie and that was good too!  Can't wait to go back and try more flavors!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! There's a large outdoor patio  in the back and a few tables out front.  I had the Papas Burrito- delicious!! It was huge, stuffed with potatoes, bacon, cheese and eggs. The salsa it came with was spot on too. The tortilla tasted homemade   It was busy even at 7:30 but the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Coffee Shop tonight around 7:30pm and the cashier was extremely rude to us. I guess maybe we were there close to closing but we were being very nice and had easy drink orders. My husband had asked what a monsoon drink was and the cashier failed to explain it. My husband didn't really get what he ordered but he did like his drink. The cashier was in a hurry and I feel like she didn't want us in there. I don't think I've ever written a bad review on Yelp but I just felt her attitude with my husband and I was uncalled for. If you value customer service, like I do, I would maybe consider going else where."}
{"text":"Only place in TI to get food late, they are open 24 hours. We ate there three times our servers were good, food was excellant but damn it's expensive. Makes it hard leaving a good tip when you are paying 2-3 times what you would normally be paying. The drinks we had here were some of the better ones we had while at TI"}
{"text":"I have been several times to The Coffee Shop and every time, it's a treat! Literally! The coffee is really great and the atmosphere is totally comfortable but to be blatantly honest, it's really all about those cupcakes. Holy amazing cakes, Batman! That's some serious greatness packed into that little bundle of dough and frosting.  I hosted an event here not too long ago and it was so fun! The service was perfect, the atmosphere was awesome. It really set the stage for a great evening. We packed the inside out and just had an evening to remember. I suggest you do the same. Come, hang out, chill and soak up all that is The Coffee Shop. You will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. My favorite place to have breakfast. Food is consistently good, but always takes a long time to receive food and coffee. Take your laptop and enjoy the free wifi in their living room after eating."}
{"text":"This place is great. I had breakfast here and service was quick! The food and pastries were good. Everyone was friendly. If I am ever in this side of Arizona, I'll make sure to drop by again! I would recommend it."}
{"text":"As far as food and coffee go, I give this place a 4.5 / 5, hands down. I got there too late for breakfast, which was a bummer. But the Club sandwich was amazing.  Thick cut bacon and plenty of avocado slices.  I'm 6'3\" @235lbs. And as a full grown man this dish was just right. The sandwich was a little tall so I imagine for non-giant people it would require a fork. The guy who brought me the food even asked if I wanted a fork.  The cappucino was tasty as well.  Good balance of espresso and milk.  I'm curious who provides their beans?  Now to the three stars... I know it's a little coffee shop, but the crowd was mostly hipster college kids (ripped up, overly tight clothes talking about their Apple Watches). I got the feel that a lot of snobbish kids living on their parents money were in there. I actually moved to the patio (which is very nice) because one of the fellows I was sitting across from was having a conversation loud enough for the whole room the hear about his trip to New York? It's a small joint. I recommend the patio as it is a shaded, open space with music that isn't to loud. Comfortable seating as well.  ."}
{"text":"One of the many great places in the ever expanding Agritopia neighborhood. Perfect patio spot for a coffee and/or breakfast when the beautiful Arizona weather hits. A real change from all of the strip mall coffee joints and chains. I usually stick to the house coffee and it's more than decent. Only thing to watch out for is a crowd. Weekend mornings can bring quite a long line, but if you find the right spot, especially on the newly expanded patio, its worth the wait. Extend the coffee shop break into either lunch next door at Joes, or beers at 12 West!"}
{"text":"The portions here are really big. It's pricey though. Everywhere in Vegas is! The corn flake French toast was delicious & my boyfriend loved his club sandwich. We were seated quick & our waiter was really nice."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. I use to live near by and the only thing stopping me is the distance. I like their coffee, desserts, and food! They were on Cup Cake wars a while back and their desserts is amazing!!! Try them when you want something sweet."}
{"text":"The line was long but it was worth it for the delicious pastries and the smiles on my grandkiddoes faces!"}
{"text":"ive never had a bad experience. small menu but everything is amazing. the urban atmosphere is my fav. customer service is good. coffee drinks and cupcakes are perfect."}
{"text":"The best Breakfast chorizo/egg burrito ever.  For lunch fresh veggie sand is amazing. Every sandwich is amazing, veggie is just my favorite."}
{"text":"Service is bad, very overpriced for it's value. If it was better service I'm sure the food would've tasted slightly better. A second cup of water would be nice too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is a bit slow but otherwise good, solid food especially after a long night, the clubhouse sandwich is great!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim for some much needed coffee. We're from Chicago and were in town for a memorial service, so we needed something to perk us up. When we got there we saw a gorgeous display of cupcakes. Since we were heading over by family next, we decided to grab a dozen. Everyone loved them! I usually hate cupcakes, but even I enjoyed them. Their coffee was great too! I only had an iced coffee, which was delicious, but they had a whole wall of tasty sounding concoctions that I would've liked to try. Their breakfast and lunch menu looked awesome as well. If I had had more time, this is definitely the kind of place I would've wanted to chill at and get a few more cups of coffee. Check it out."}
{"text":"service was rude , the food Is not good . i do not recommend this place. dEbbie the waitress was not nice at all. very dry attitude."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast one day. No issues with the food it was standard diner fare but the slow was not even the word for the service. Needless to say we wound up walking the few extra minutes to Starbucks every other morning for the remainder of the trip and grabbed breakfast there instead."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and prompt. The drinks are def on the sweet side, but all of the cashiers and baristas are familiar w the menu and are amazing at recommending tweaks to their drinks to fit your taste.   The food is pretty good - from the Omelets to the Friday fish taco special (which is a Must Try!), delish!"}
{"text":"I ate here before and the breakfast was really good! I had eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrown and it was good. The coffee and service was really good too! I would definitely return next time I stay at Treasure Island."}
{"text":"The wait probably should have been a deal breaker because we could clearly see empty tables. Regardless we decided to stay and eat and that resulted in us ordering Beef Pho, Beef Bahn Mi, and Chicken fried rice. The wait wasn't too bad and when the food came out it was hot. Everything was okay but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place calls itself \"The Coffee Shop\" but let me tell you, its far from being a coffee shop. We stopped in to order some coffee and what I got was something that taste like instant coffee. It was so weak I asked the waiter if I could get a fresh cup. He said it was fresh and that if I wanted something stronger I should order the expresso. I kindly agreed to the expresso and after a few minutes he came out with a cup. He was very nice and waited for me to taste it before he left. But in reality, even the expresso was very weak. It wasn't that dark color nor was it in a small expresso cup that you normally would get when ordering expresso. It was again weak, more like a tad bit stronger coffee and in a normal coffee cup size. So I kindly nodded a \"no\" with the waiter and he told me he'll be right back with a double shot. Once he returned with another coffee cup sized expresso, a little stronger than last but yet not expresso. I just kindly nodded a \"yes\" to him and we both smiled. But let me tell you, if you are thinking of going to \"The Coffee Shop\" for some coffee, don't be surprise that the coffee isn't up to par with it's title name. Also note that I have not tried the food so I can not express my opinions for that matter. So if you are in a dire need for good strong coffee go outside TI and look to your left you will see STARBUCKS."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of LA without the LA coffee shop BS! Friendly service, amazing atmosphere. This is our go to place for breakfast or lunch. My wife and I love the vegan Benedict. One of the only places in the area that accommodates all sorts of dieters restrictions. I also love the Tuna sandwich, super fresh and always good. Sitting outside with the birds around if it's not too hot is also amazing.  Only downside is seating, people come and sit there for hours to study and grab a cup of coffee so some days even though we would love to eat here, due to the heat outside and people just studying at the tables we pass on going. All in all one of our fav spots in gilbert."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often as this is a great place to get some work done and have great food and drinks.   I stopped in here this afternoon to get some out of the four wall office time and was going to treat myself to one of those amazing whoopie pies. Coconut it was and it tasted very good until I came across the red hair that managed to bake it's way into the side of the sweetness. (I am blond, not naturally, but still blond )  I brought it out the counter and the young man was very apologetic. I sat back down and he came over shortly with a $15 coupon for next time.   Because they are local and because they took care of their customer, I will be back."}
{"text":"This is based solely on an order of avocado toast! Lol while basic it really hit the spot on a night that I wasn't really feeling well. The place is a full mix of all sort of things, I'm assuming to pacify as many people as possible. All in all, if for some reason your are staying at TI and don't want to leave the premises there's def some sort of option here for you. But the price tags are hefty even for the basics."}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful, very quaint coffee shop that just happens to have wonderful cupcakes. The location is great. It is in a quiet neighborhood by Joe's Farm Grill and The Farm at Agritopia. The atmosphere of this place is very welcoming. It has very big windows that allow a lot of sunlight to come through. There are tables indoors and outdoors for eating and couches for lounging. There are many varieties of people who come in, from friends wanting to chat, to students meeting for study sessions. (The have free wifi.) The only downside is the lack of wall outlets needed for charging electronic equipment such as computers."}
{"text":"Stopped in late forna burger after a very lively evening at Gillys. After a short wait we were sested and our drink order taken and promptly delivered. I ordered the double cheeseburger with fries. Surprisingly itnwas delivered fast and looked pretty good. Well to be honest it would have been probably alot better except the bun itself tasted like dry cardboard.  Upgrade the bun folks and you might have a winner burger here. Also prices here are absolutely ridiculous for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I had one of the best breakfast croissant sandwiches here. The bacon was out of this world...like from mars or something...I mean...what does \"out of this world\" even mean...  I digress   I have never really had a coffee drink I enjoy here...but I also do not drink milk, and prefer coconut milk in my coffee, which they do not have. I know they will jump on the coconut train soon...I hope....please read this. Thank you."}
{"text":"I avoided this place for a long time because I assumed that since it had the generic name and seemed to be part of the community center that it couldn't POSSIBLY be good - and how wrong I was.  This place is awesome.  It's one of two places I've been where the toddy is ALWAYS smooth and delicious, no need for cream!  I usually grab an iced coffee and a pastry of some kind on the way to work and have never been disappointed.  I've tried a breakfast sandwich as well - very good.  You can always taste quality ingredients.  I wish I could go here one morning without having to go straight to work, because the ambience is amazing.  Lots of windows, surrounded by beautiful foliage and huge cactus flowers, cats walking around.  I love it and want to stay all day.  The only downside I have is it's definitely on the pricey side - my morning routine of iced coffee and one pastry sets me back about $7 to $8... so I have to cut back.  But long story short this is a standout cafe and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We were seated right away and a waitress took our drink orders. Be warned: they don't serve lunch items before 11 am. I was really in the mood for lunch instead of breakfast, but we were there at 10:30 am and had to order breakfast. A different waitress took our entree orders. I ordered the continental breakfast, which came with coffee or tea and juice. My boyfriend ordered a western omelet and added onions & peppers ($1.50 up charge) and it was served with hash browns & toast. His juice was $6. The portions were large but for the prices they are charging, I would expect the flavor to be spectacular. I would maybe try this place for lunch but I would skip out on coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. The very young girl taking our order was not very friendly and seemed annoyed that I wasn't familiar with bread choices for my sandwich. I ordered an over-priced BLT with a side of chips. It was only over-priced because turns out their idea of a bacon sandwich is to take one piece of bacon and crumble it up and spread over the whole sandwich. They should really call it a tomato sandwich because they put about six slices of tomato on it. My side of chips turned out to be the crumbs at the bottom of the bag of Ruffles-type chips. Seriously-not even one whole chip, just crumbs. The only reason why I give 2 stars is because my wife's wrap was decent and they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"I am a fan and love the concept however the owners aren't as kind and outgoing as I thought they would be, to be fair they are usually pretty busy! I consistently go in there and never even get a smile. Love the freshness and the food. Wish they had pancakes, waffles, etc. Pricey but cute! I used to love the way they operated with post it notes, etc. keeping it simple but noticed they have iPads now :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, not the best but not the worst. I got the turkey and havarti sandwich, wasn't very good at all. I don't know what type of lettuce they use, but it was awful. I got one of their red velvet cupcakes that several people told me are \"better than sprinkles\"....lies! They were ok, but no where near sprinkles status. I liked the ambiance and the outdoor seating, it's a cute little place to grab a coffee, but my husband and I won't be going out of our way to go here again."}
{"text":"We come here every year when we visit Vegas for our anniversary just so my husband can get the corned beef hash for breakfast. Now I know why! Gave it a try this year and it is fantastic!   Service is a bit slow which is why we give it 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Only reviewing the 2 cupcakes I bought here. One was the red velvet and the other was the lemon. They just didn't taste fresh at all. The lemon one seemed like it was still in the process of being thaw.   My sister enjoys the coffee here, but I'll definitely be back for the food and give it a fair review."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast in Gilbert.  The San Diegan is to die for.  This place is a going little shop that is always busy."}
{"text":"Great place to sit on a quiet patio for breakfast/brunch. It's casual and affordable, quick and yummy! Try the San Diegan omelette! I'll be back next time I'm visiting Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Just enough food. We split a Denver omelette, lots of food on the plate! Food was good. Service was fast! Came here because we are staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"Most locals know about this place. Owned by \"Joe\" known for Liberty Market, Joes BBQ, and Joes Farm House. This place meets the standards of the others. Great menu and great drinks. I went with the basic drip coffee tonight. It defiantly did not disappoint. I normally go with the iced green tea. You can't go wrong there either. Pastries are awesome too. Basically, go and hangout at this rare coffee shop. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Well this restaurant is all over the place. The meal that I had last time was definitely much better than their breakfast. I came in here Christmas Eve morning and there wasn't much of a wait, which I appreciated.  I was seated along the wall which was fine at first but then I could feel the cold air coming in from the outside. To top it off, there was some kid behind me yelling on an outside bench. That's not the fault of the restaurant, it's just a poor design.   i got a Denver omelette which is pretty hard to mess up. It wasn't the worst that I've ever had but the omelette wasn't very hot and there was way too much cheese on it. Also, the hash browns had a weird taste that I can't explain. The toast and coffee was good. And so was the service for that matter. Actually, the waitress was the highlight of my morning...super sweet and friendly.   The meal ended up costing $30 with tax and tip. I really didn't get a $30 meal though. But you're trapped in the hotel and they can charge what they want and they know it."}
{"text":"Date visited: 2008-07-05  Needed a simple coffee shop for breakfast... save the good stuff for lunch and dinner! hehe  I ordered something I have never ordered before - eggs benedict. Not bad. My mom ordered blueberry pancakes. They gave a lot and it was pretty good.   I am not a big breakfast fan so not much of a review here."}
{"text":"Good food and a really cool atmosphere. The breakfast burritos are really good but pretty pricey.   Local haunt always busy but worth the wait. Bring your dog to the patio as its pet friendly."}
{"text":"I moved to Gilbert about six years ago and was in search of a local coffee shop and much to my surprise this business popped right away.  It is tucked away in Agritopia right next to Joe's Farm Grill.  Don't let the name fool you because they have wonderful baked goods, breakfast, lunch, and of course assorted coffee drinks.  I have tried an array of items on the menu and my favorite is always the San Diegan.  It is an open faced omelet with potatoes, bacon, cheese, tomatoes, onions, sour cream and feta.  I know I know...that is a lot of food but it is darn good.  It is definitely something that you can split with someone as it is very hearty.  I go back and forth between the scones and coffee cakes.  The scone flavors vary day to day but my favorites are the butterscotch and chocolate chip peanut butter.  I've never seen a blueberry white chocolate coffee cake and they make one that is out of this world.    They were also featured on cupcakes wars a few times and were also featured on Check Please, AZ.  I may have reviewed them on Check Please, AZ....maybe   This is one of my favorite places and I go back there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Again, it's a coffee shop people so please don't complain about the food or service!!!  IT is what is is....you get what you get with a smile.  Most importantly, they have KENO!!  One of the few places on the Vegas Strip where you can eat and play KENO, old-school style.  And you only know what I mean if you love playing KENO!  Have a milkshake, pick your numbers and toast my late grandmother who could play for hours!  xoxo"}
{"text":"Way to go, Joe!  You did it again!  We love Joe's family of restaurants, so why did we wait so long to try the Coffee Shop?  Well, we finally did, and that's what counts.  Now my quad of Eating at Joe's is complete.  My sister and I rode our bicycles over to The Coffee Shop one morning for coffee and breakfast.  We opted for indoor seating in the a/c since it was pretty hot outside even at 8 am.  We shared the Veggie scramble with egg whites.  It was chocked full of mushrooms, spinach, tomato and topped off with just the right amount of swiss cheese.  We add a small fruit which was sweet red strawberries and tangy sweet pineapple cut up into tiny pieces.  We completed our meal with an iced black n white mocha and iced caramel macchiato.   We then brought friends and family to eat breakfast here.  We have tried the breakfast burrito that is so huge you better share it.  It is stuffed full of potato, egg and cheese.  Dad had an omelet that came with home fried potatoes that were sooo yummy!  This is a MUST if you like fresh made to order food and delicious coffee.  Forget Starbucks, this is way better! The place also offers sandwiches and salads for lunch, so if you don't have time for a stop in the morning, make time for lunch!  And if you don't have time for lunch, grab a yummy cupcake, cookie, muffin, or whoopie pie to go!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend after a drunken night at about 4am.  We were seated in less than 5 minutes, and a waitress arrived to give us menus and take our orders almost immediately.  We decided to get the chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce and the burger, and split both.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium: juicy, with good grill flavor, and complimented nicely with crunchy onions and fresh veggies.  The fries were okay- they were of the thicker Wendy's-style variety.  The chicken fingers were clearly dumped out of a freezer bag into the fryer, but good nonetheless.  The coating was thick and crunchy, and the honey mustard they served with it was certainly homemade. They also gave us several crunchy, fresh celery sticks as an accompaniment.  I can't complain...this meal saved me from what surely would have been a raging hangover the next morning."}
{"text":"The problem with this place is that they are serving ok/ pretty good food and charging & acting like it's gourmet. It isn't.     $17.95 for a simple omelette and hash browns? $16 for French Toast? $8 for a plain glass of orange juice? This food isn't bad but it's pretty similar to what you'd get at Denny's or a standard breakfast joint. The service is okay but $58 for this breakfast for 2 is silly . . . . especially where, again, it's not really better than a regular restaurant breakfast."}
{"text":"#49/2016  One side breakfast, the other side Pho and Americanized Cantonese dishes.  We had both meals and dishes that were good. You won't be blown away but then again, TI doesn't seem to be trying all that hard  (Other than housekeeping- those women should be scooped up by the Four Seasons!)  A blueberry muffin and granola/yogurt/berry parfait, me a mushroom and Gruyere omelette (asked for half the cheese) were fine. I appreciated the never-ending pot of coffee on the table.   For dinner two nights before, Cantonese classics: sweet and sour pork and honey walnut shrimp.  Breakfast and dinner were neither bad nor excellent. They were all okay dishes, mostly for their convenience and that they were served hot.  Wait, but their Imperial rolls were very good: the kitchen went all in for the fish sauce and I said yeaaaasss!   Okay everything: food, service, ambience. It won't knock your socks off but it'll satisfy and that's alright."}
{"text":"So wanted to like this place. Ordered pastrami sandwiches. When asked what kind of bread, my wife and I said rye but were told they didn't have it and that everyone gets sourdough. The sand which was incredibly dry. We also ordered cupcakes that were pretty good. The worst part came when we went to order a sandwich a cupcake to go. As my wife stood in line to order, I used the restroom. While in there, I noticed something on the floor... several somethings. There were two dead cockroaches and a what I thought was a third one... until it started to move. I came out of the restroom and my wife, who was ready to leave without the food, simply pointed at the cupcake display and then I noticed the flies. Completely disgusted!  You can tell it's bad when you don't even want your money back, you just want to leave!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing staff. Great food and amazing coffee!   I work from home and have started using this as my \"get-away office\" so I can be around some people and good energy.   Great wifi service.   It can DEFINITELY get a bit crowded but if you get a chance I'd definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Great food, simple menu, fast service, cheap prices. Fresh ingredients. Where do they get their avocados from?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Good coffee, fresh food (the eggs were delicious), great selection of pastries and vegan options too. The location is a nice change from the desert scape with lots of trees and grass."}
{"text":"I love this little coffee shop next to Joe's Farm Grill.  They have a nice patio that is dog friendly and can accommodate a lot of people.  They have different sandwiches and breakfast items than Joe's Farm Grill and the quality is right on par with JFG.  I had a delicious breakfast burrito there once.  I love the creaminess of their lattes and they don't over sweeten them.  Take a stroll through the community garden after your meal for an all around great experience."}
{"text":"Pretty ok, standard eggs Benedict. Eggs were nicely over easy, the sauce could be improved with a free seasonings. The staff is friendly and courteous. Our meals would be $3-4 less anywhere else, but you expect to pay more on the strip."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I waited so long to write this review. Maybe because the line is long enough to get 1 of my favorite breakfast meals that I don't want the line to be any longer. Unfortunately, the word is out because this place is action packed even on the weekdays. I found this little gem while eating next door. It sits nestled in a quaint garden of flowers and greenery. Open patio seating in the front and rear. So beautiful and serene, It's easy to imagine yourself anywhere but Gilbert, AZ. Ordering takes place inside. Step up to the counter and the entire menu is chalk boarded on the wall. Delicious baked goods taunt you from the display case. Gourmet coffee harmoniously filling the air tempting your taste buds. If your not excited let me know and I'll grab the defibrillator.  I've tried several items on the menu but the 1's that impress me the most is the San Diegan. It's an open faced omelette with mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, feta cheese, Shredded cheese and I think a couple other things. Delish!! On the weekends, if your lucky you can catch an amazing biscuits and gravy or an eggs Benedict. Mind blown! Tempt your taste buds with a baked delicacy, my advice the faux doughnut. What does that mean exactly.... The doughnut is baked instead of fried. Now get your self into the coffee shop and see for yourself what a breakfast bliss can do for your chi"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I'm giving a 4 to a Coffee Shop...not something I usually do. However, my husband and I really enjoyed our breakfast here! The service was fast and efficient and the food was delightful.   I got the Huevos Rancheros...and I consider myself an excellent judge of this since I get it everywhere. OMG it was REALLY good, perhaps the best I've ever had! And it was gigantic!  My husband got the breakfast sandwich and he loved his too!  It's a coffee shop, so if I wasn't staying TI or Mirage, I probably wouldn't get out of bed and walk down the strip to go back, BUT if I was staying at a hotel near it, I DEFINITELY would return!!"}
{"text":"Coffee - cheaper and better than the competition.  Americano is my go-to.  Food - I've only had the club on sourdough(!) and chocolate chip cookies - both are excellent.  Atmosphere - nice.  Couches inside and a great patio overlooking the farms at Agritopia.  This is my favorite coffee shop in the east valley - hands down."}
{"text":"If you are hung over, tired, and don't have it in you to man the strip, then go here.   The menu selection is plain and predictable, but I hardly think predictable is what carries over to a good meal. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich was heaven as a welcome meal and a scramble for breakfast the morning after I danced my butt off the night before. Our waiter was funny, and having the traffic he does everyday, refreshingly polite and happy.  The fries are something to be talked about: thin, crispy, and not greasy. Perfect with a sandwich or as a side for a snack. Helpings are more than average-sized so if you're not too hungry, sharing is caring, as my kids would say."}
{"text":"I love the coffee shop!!  A perfect place for breakfast!  The tj omelette is so delicious, a wonderful blend of chorizo, potatoes, cheese and tomatoes!  It tastes like a taco in omelette form!  The sitting area outside is so nice, I love it. The imperial is also a good option, can't go wrong with it. The bacon is so crispy!  The brownies are so moist, I couldn't get enough. I wish I could eat the whole pan!    Bird enthusiasts also come there every weekend with exotic birds and you can even get a picture with a parrot on your shoulder!  How nice. I just feel that the sitting area inside is very limited, not too happy with that. But the food is great and the ambiance is nice!"}
{"text":"Love this place! First time I was here was because we were looking for a place who had gluten free breakfast pastries for a friend of mine. The pasteries were amazing. They had a variety of options from coffee cakes to cupcakes, cookies to bars. Some gluten free! I loved this place so much, I returned with my hubby but this time we had a burrito. LOVED IT! I had the chorizo and recommend it to everyone! Piping hot and eggs were nice and fluffy. Mmmmmm! The atmosphere is nice and staff is very friendly. All over great experience."}
{"text":"Saw this place on cupcake wars and decided to make the 15 minute drive out to taste the cupcakes.... was pretty disappointed overall. Parking wasn't simple, parking lot is a bit strange.. was looking forward to  trying the cupcakes, selection was not really there but we did go a few hours before closing so maybe that was it? I did like their icing because it wasn't just pure sugar, it was a cream cheese nice and light icing.. the cupcake on the other hand I was not what I was expecting, and not in a good way. The cups and itself, as in the flavors, was good, it was just so dense and thick that my 4yr old didn't want to finish her vanilla one and I had trouble finishing the berry one. I'm not a cupcake expert but I was pretty sad with the cupcake:/"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Cutest farm to table lunch spot. Food is delicious, cupcakes make you dream about them!  Food takes a while but well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Its open late! And i love late night food to settle all the alcohol in my blood, or should i say blood in my alcohol. Its not expensive (compared to Vegas prices) good portions. Hey if your staying at TI might as well eat here! We did at like 5 in the morning."}
{"text":"I love The Coffee Shop!  I stop in weekly to relax for a few hours with my service animal.  They are so kind, the coffee is fantastic, and their breakfast burritos are prime!  Great energy and I'm genuinely happy to be there.  Thank you for providing such wonderful service in Gilbert! :)"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with chips. Asked if they would cut the sandwich in half and an extra plate. They brought out the two halves on their own plates and split the chips for us. A nice gesture and the main reason for the 5 stars. Excellent service! Our waiter was on point!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from the Food Network Cupcake Wars.  I promised my girls to take them for a treat so this was the place I picked. I thought for a $3.00 cupcake it would be spectacular, but it wasn't.  It was - - a cupcake.  I frankly could make 12 cupcakes at home for the same price and the same taste. One of my daughters didn't like it at all. I wouldn't go back for the cupcakes.  I haven't tried the other stuff they offer.  It seems like they specialize in vegan cupcakes.  Which I could care less about."}
{"text":"I had the Tj omelet. It looked and tasted so good that a lady at another table made her son come over and ask me what I was eating."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab one of my favorite breakfast burritos this morning. Chorizo and egg burro at The Coffee Shop is delicious.  Place was buzzin this morning as always.  I passed on the blended monsoon coffee, which by the way is also spectacular!  Recommend you try it for yourself.  Great place to hang out with ur wife and relax."}
{"text":"It was ok not the best breakfast and coffee ive had but overall it was good thanks for the coffee"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, the baked goods are some of the best I've ever had.   I come here for my morning coffee often and love it.   I only wish they would open earlier... 7am is very late in my morning"}
{"text":"Best coffee and atmosphere around! The Cuff Cake coffee is my go to, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Not to mention their sweet treats are to die for! Their breakfast and lunch options are fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to coffee shops when I want to stay in Mesa/Gilbert area. I love studying here but for others looking for a study spot - there aren't many outlets!! And the brunch time rush on weekends can be really distracting if you're trying to get some hard core studying in, because the line will be huge!   Aesthetics - this is why I come here. I love every bit of Agritopia, and The Coffee Shop is a perfect addition. Something about being here with natural light of Arizona sun flooding in just lifts my spirits. Exactly the mood booster I need when getting ready to *hit the grind* (heh pun intended) or just get brunch with a friend.  Caffeine - pretty wide range of options, both coffee/tea/more!  Cupcakes - I personally don't love cupcakes, but for the sake of Yelp, I took a bite of my friend's red velvet, and I have to say it was pretty good! And honestly, the display is so enticing I actually think about ordering the desserts even though I don't have a huge huge sweet tooth. Everyone I know enjoys it though, so definitely worth a try! (Especially bc they were featured in Cupcake Wars!!!)  Food - every time I come, I have a dilemma with what to order because everything looks so good and FRESH. I got the Turkey and Havarti sandwich the first time and loved it so much I sometimes have cravings for it. Next time though, I'll be sure to try more of their options - because there will certainly be many more next times to come!"}
{"text":"This was a weird place. Located in the Treasure Island Casino they served just regular coffee, dessert and Vietnamese food. I get a little miffed when a place that just serves regular coffee calls themselves a coffee shop.   One our first night in Vegas we came here for dessert but we were seated at a food table anyway. I had the chocolate ice box cake and hubby had the ice cream Sundae. He didn't the Sundae, the cake was good but too much chocolate.   I think it was pretty overpriced too but a lot of Vegas is overpriced."}
{"text":"Kind of like a more expensive chain breakfast/lunch location, I wasn't too impressed with this Vegas cuisine. Also random that they served a separate set of Vietnamese food if you don't feel like eating American. Average price seemed to be around the 15$ range, which was way more than it should have been. I split one of the omelets, and it was served with toast and a heaping of hash browns. Hash browns were alright, not that crispy, a bit mushy. Omelet was okay, but I wasn't that excited about it. Service felt a little odd, our server's sarcasm or the way she jokes threw me off a little bit. But at least we kept ourselves entertained by playing Keno!"}
{"text":"So many things are done right at this great little shop. The atmosphere is inviting, the baked goods are amazing and their meals are delicious. The sad irony about The Coffee Shop is they do everything right except for the coffee. It's awful and has been consistently awful through all my visits.  There is a marked difference between a cup from Liberty Market, one of Joe's other fantastic ventures, and The Coffee Shop and I don't understand why.  Don't get me wrong though, The Coffee Shop is really more of an experience or an ideal. They've done a fantastic job creating an environment that is comfortable, relaxing and fun. The kind of place where you can hang out with a group of friends and never notice the hours slip by. It's the neighborhood coffee shop we all wish we had around the corner.  The amazing quality of the baked goods far outweighs the lack of quality coffee. The red velvet cupcake is a masterpiece and the homemade scones are outstanding.  The food and the atmosphere are the reasons I like this place. If they started serving Cartel coffee, The Coffee Shop could become nirvana."}
{"text":"I think we have tried almost everything at this place.  From the cupcakes to the coconut cream moon pies.  Not only is the food really good, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed."}
{"text":"This place. Just adorable. The atmosphere is amazing and the company is even better. Everyone is so friendly and the coffee is very good."}
{"text":"the four stars are strictly for the cupcakes and the service. $2.75 for a small iced tea is outrageous and while the field veggie sandwich was good- it wasn't worth the almost $8.00 i paid for it. the cupcakes, however, were amazing-the boston cream and red velvet were SO good and the fact that they held them in the freezer for me until i got there was great. i would recommend you call ahead and find out what flavors they have-they are more than willing to make suggestions and give reviews. the place is nonsmoking inside and out, which is a plus for 99% of the population."}
{"text":"I dont understand why this has such low ratings ! I had excellent service, delicious steak and THEEE BEST BAKED POTATO EVER! I got the prime rib and it was perfectly cooked, with delicious au jus to complement the MEAT. I ate allll 12 oz of it and managed to demolish the baked potato with almost 1lb of butter and sour cream. HEY I WAS ON VACATION!! Dont judge me! For $32 well worth the cozy ambience."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the overpriced food is a close second. Best thing about this joint was it was located in the casino where we were staying, and it was open late."}
{"text":"Here's a fabulous tip: they serve breakfast ALL DAY on Sundays. Yes, you saw that right, alllll day.   Boyfriend got the papas grandes burrito and I got the waffle with fresh cream and berries...and here we have discovered the miraculous and satisfying pleasure of getting to half both savory and sweet. Perfection.   Also, try a monsoon. With almond milk if you dare. Seriously the creamiest, tastiest coffee confection you'll ever try.   The atmosphere is casual and cozy and everything you could possibly order is wonderful. You can't go wrong here folks!"}
{"text":"This cafe is really nice! There are windows everywhere and outside they have a patio and grass! Their coffee is a hit or a miss (depending on who makes it), the cupcakes are good, strawberry smoothie is great, and the sandwiches are delicious!   Food 4/5 Atmosphere 5/5 Service 4/5  The best part of this place is the atmosphere, it's very pretty. They also have wifi, making it a nice study spot."}
{"text":"I love The Coffee Shop! I have only been for breakfast, but everything I have tried has been delicious.  It is a little noisy on weekend mornings, and there are a lot of people there. However, they handle the large number of people efficiently and are super friendly.  I recommend the Indio and Baby Got Jack breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Location is convenient if your staying in the hotel. Food is blah nothing special. Way overpriced for what it is. Just blah."}
{"text":"The food was okay and wasn't under $40 for breakfast or dinner.  $15 wonton soup was a stretch but it was the largest bowl of wonton I have ever had.  I didn't get a chance to try the Pho but I can live with that decision."}
{"text":"I went to the coffee shop at TI today.  It sits next to the Pho place, they are basically the same place with a different host desk.  Same table areas and I'm sure the food comes out of the same kitchen.  My husband and I entered through the coffee shop entrance and even though they were semi-busy it was still a wait to get a table.  There were at least half a dozen empty tables waiting to be cleared.  The hostess looked upset and kept coming to apologize for our wait, as a huge line began to form behind us.  I mean show some initiative and grab a bucket instead of freaking out about it.    We were seated at a table next to the service entrance which was annoying, but at least our waitress couldn't duck and hide.  I asked if we could order off the Pho menu.  I only wanted some spring rolls, no weird shaped spoons, tiny bowls or fancy condiments required.  I was told they could not accommodate my request.  We both ordered \"The biggest burger on the strip\" which I'm sure it's not.  Ten ounces the menu claims, I doubt it, but whatever it was edible.    The bill came with our order, no upsales there.  I did order a soda when my meal came and it must have been too much of a choir to re-do the bill, so I got my beverage for free.  Not once were we checked on during our lunch, but we got a re-fill when the waitress brought back the reciept to sign.  Not that we really needed it, we were done.  Not bad if your staying at the hotel I suppose, a bit over-priced.  Just remember if you want pho or any asian food you better damn well enter at the pho side or your sh*t outta luck."}
{"text":"Taste like crap on crap. Reheated over price frozen food? Is this even Vietnamese food?"}
{"text":"Love this place, have been coming here for over a year and coffee and staff are always great!"}
{"text":"So I came here about a year ago for breakfast and since I don't live in the area I kind of forgot about it. One day my husband's comes home with some cupcakes and it completely changed my life!! He brought home a chocolate chip cookie dough cupcake and it really tasted like one! It wasn't dense or heavy feeling and amazing! He also got the lemon one and I was thinking ehh once you've had one lemon cupcake, you've had them all but boy was I wrong!! This was the best lemon cupcake I've ever had! I used to be crazy about Sprinkles cupcakes, but they got nothing on The Coffee Shop's cupcakes! You definitely have to try their cupcakes at least once!"}
{"text":"A well balanced coffee shop, with good drinks, amazing pastries, local community, and hidden surprises.  It's built in an old tractor shed, located on at Agritopia, an urban farm and neighborhood. During the day, you'll find plenty of moms with their kids, a few coworkers with their laptops, and one or two of the hard-to-find Gilbert hipsters.  Oh and did I mention surprises? Keep an eye out of mahi mahi fish tacos, Coffee and Cigarettes cupcakes, and a local cigar group on Friday nights.  Other notes: Beware laptop users, limited power outlets; Vespa/scooter owners, there's a reserved parking spot for you; Produce stand (seasonal) is across the way"}
{"text":"I like the Coffee Shop. If you are a fan if sandwiches, coffee and tea, then this is your place. They also have good cupcakes. I do think it's a little overpriced. But it's the atmosphere and the atmosphere is fabulous. I love to meet with friends and enjoy coffee together there. It's a great place."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I was so hungover I wanted a steaming bowl of pho. However, once we got there, to my dismay, they did not serve pho before 11AM. I know what were we doing up before 11 AM anyways especially after a long night of partying in Vegas? The answer... We had to drive back to Cali and we wanted to avoid the traffic madness. So we decided to eat the breakfast menu instead of the much needed pho.   I sat down, looked at the menu and I knew I wanted the eggs Benedict. When the eggs Benedict came out, I thought geez this does not look so appetizing. Maybe it's better than it looks... Boy, was I way wrong...   This is by far the worst place I have ever gotten an eggs benedict. The eggs benedict's hollandaise sauce was so thin and had an odd flavor. It wasn't creamy and fatty like I am used to. The eggs were way over cooked. The eggs were poached hard. When I cut through the egg it was literally a hard boiled egg. Like what the heck? That's the worst thing ever. The ham was deli meat... Oh my, what a fail.   Although their eggs Benedict was gross, I think I would go back for their pho one day... But now I know I have to go here after 11AM."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and whoppie : )  It was too hot to sit outside, but I saw many local still enjoy outdoor sitting.  I have the IMPERIAL OMELETTE, and my friend have BURRITO SUPREME and a lot of whoppie. Life is good with great food.  I enjoyed the outdoor sitting, but a little too hot.  The staff was friendly and many cute girls."}
{"text":"Every single item I have ordered here has been delicious and consistently made well! The drinks are very flavorful and the food is fresh and filling."}
{"text":"We recently moved out of Gilbert and this is literally the only place I miss. We would come here weekly for their fantastic sandwiches and savory breakfasts. The California Club was always a standout. All of the ingredients taste so fresh and so well put together. And I love that they always put chips on the plate! The selection varies, so you never knew if you were gonna get Fritos or Ruffles that day. The TJ omelet with its chorizo, sour cream, and potatoes was so addicting! My other faves were any of the breakfast sandwiches, the breakfast burrito (must get!), and the turkey havarti sandwich. Really, you can't go wrong with anything you order here.   I haven't tried many of the coffee drinks because once I had the Spanish Latte, I was hooked! It's really better warm, though, so I had to miss out on it during the summer months. But it's so sweet and delicious!  The cupcakes are phenomenal too. Order one. You won't be sorry!  This place is ALWAYS busy (and for good reason). I just wish they had more registers open and more people to help out because the line can hit the back of the restaurant. There never seems to be any urgency in the staff. It's also a little frustrating when you place a pickup order, you have to get in that line to pick up your previously ordered food. So your food could be sitting there for 10-15 minutes just waiting for you to get to the front of the line. Not really convenient when you're in a hurry and just need to grab-and-go. Sometimes the water jug is totally empty and there's no one available to refill it. Hence the need for more help. You have to keep up with the demand!"}
{"text":"Located within treasure island. It's an odd combo a pho shop and coffee shop. I only ordered a Cobb salad $15 and service seemed good, unlike other reviews.  The salad was decent and serving size was large. We spilt the salad between two people  and it was enough food.  I can't speak for the pho, but the bowls seemed large and people around me seemed to be enjoying them."}
{"text":"This place is trash. The restaurant was packed because it was 5pm. I expected a long wait, but I noticed a lot of table were empty in the middle.  Their were more then enough waiters to seat more people.  I counted 7 waiters and about 20 tables that were occupied.  I dont know any waiter that would work with only 3 tables to make a decent pay for the night.  We got seated after 45 mins of waiting.  Our food took an hour to get out, and we still didnt get our drinks because the waitress never came around after we ordered.  Maybe she was on her period.  THe food was actually really good but it was way over priced for the small portion, and after 2 1/2 hours its so not worth it."}
{"text":"Why are you so far from my house!!!!!!!????  I love this place.  Great coffee, amazing pastries, and a really cute ambiance.  I can't wait to go when it's not a thousand degrees to enjoy their farmer's market area and possibly even sit outside (what a novel idea in Phoenix!). On second thought, it's probably better that you're so far from me...my butt would be huge if your cupcakes were any more convenient."}
{"text":"I'm freakin' DONE with this place.  Every time I come here I get above-average food (good!) with poor service (bad!)  Last time I was here our server never came back to pick up our check and it took so long that i had to get up and go looking for someone else to get us some change.  This time I ordered the soup-and-half-sandwich plate. I was offered chicken noodle or French onion. I went with the onion. When the check came, I was charged extra for the soup. When my server came back to pick up my card (and she took a LONG time to come back around and wasn't even the same server as the time before... is this protocol at this restaurant?) she said \"oh, yeah, that soup costs extra.\" Interesting, as the surcharge isn't noted on the menu and as a former server myself, I know I should have been told about this when given the choices.  I won't lie: the food is pretty hearty. But is it worth the flippant service?"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like the coffee shop!  I've been going here for years, as a Gilbert resident, and this place still hasn't shaken it's aloof, hipstery barista vibes. Oh well. The drinks are fine and it's a cool little meet-up spot next to the equally cool agritopia.    Give it a try.  Also, their cupcakes were featured on the Cupcake Wars TV show on food network (if that means anything to you)"}
{"text":"The coffee and the food are good here. I suggest the breakfast burritos! I agree with most other yelp-ers. The service isn't great. They are not overly friendly. There is always a long line and it's always very crowded. It can be hard to find a seat inside and it can be very noisy inside. I prefer to sit outside on the patio when it's nice out!  Also, they frequently get my coffee order wrong (wrong milk, wrong syrup, wrong size, etc) but they will fix it if i tell them. They just aren't super nice about it.   I like coming here because it's close to my house, but it's not worth driving out of the way for."}
{"text":"Looking at all the other fantastic reviews for this place I was really hoping for a better product. I bought 6 cupcakes for a birthday dinner (chocolate, chocolate oreo, red velvet, lemon, mixed berry, and coconut). I have to say that I was extremely disappointed by the taste, and texture of all of the flavors. The cupcakes were dry, dense, and had very little flavor. The overall presentation of the cupcakes was very cute, and they were decorated wonderfully, however that did not make up for the taste. After paying over $3 a cupcake I was really expecting something better. I was almost embarrassed to serve these to my friends and family. I will give it two stars because it was a nice little coffee shop in a great location. I can only base this review off of the cupcakes, I haven't tried any of their other food, but I sure do hope that the rest of their menu tastes better than their cupcakes."}
{"text":"at 3pm it was nice. coffee was good and the eggs were good. the lox or \"salmon platter\" was surprisongly good."}
{"text":"The food is good here. If you are waiting in line at Joe's, try this place. It is just as hip and the food is good. Why not eat in the garage."}
{"text":"I love this place, I eat here at least once a week. Great food, drinks, ambience, and the best cupcakes you will ever have. The only thing they need to change if their ordering system. They hand write your order on a post it note and then walk the note over to the kitchen and then ring your order on an ipad. They need to get a pos system so they can simply ring the order in on the ipad and it goes directly to the kitchen. The current process takes way too long and is seriously frustrating since there is always a long line of people waiting to order."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are always busy, which is ok because I think it's well worth the wait. The Coffee Shop has a good atmosphere, and the outdoor seating is nice. They are known for their cupcakes (even featured on Cupcake Wars) but I have not tried them yet. As for the breakfast, I love the San Diegan- yum! The coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - Great!  Service - Great!  Veggie Sandwich! - AMAZING....hands down the freshest sandwich I have every eaten."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I was excited to come here and try the party punch and a small lunch with my niece. I got there and told them it was my first time here. I tried to order a party punch but they were out of that. Then I chose another tea and they were out of that AS WELL. I got their pomegranate tea and a club sandwich. Tea was okay and the sandwich didn't have much flavor plus a slap of ruffles on the plate. MEH. I was better off going to s-bucks. Maybe I happen to go on a bad day? I'm not sure, money ain't a issue for me but it wasn't worth the 16 dollars. =("}
{"text":"We tried this place out because it was the only one (besides Kahunaville) that was open in the morning at TI. It's also open for 24hrs. We had wonton soup, teriyaki salmon bowl, and one of the breakfast skillet. The food was delicious--the salmon was fresh, the broth of the wonton soup was non-greasy but the wontons were more like dumplings...the breakfast skillet was also good. Everything was served in large portions. I would have to say that it was a bit pricey though. We also had the carrot cake which was deliciously moist and not that sweet. Our server was great but I would have to say that the lady who brought us our drinks (not our server) could have been a little bit happier :)"}
{"text":"A new place that I was recommended too! I'm glad I came. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted. They have so many menu options and dairy free options. I didn't eat here but the food menu had many options. I did get a cookie that was yummy! To drink I got a matcha tea latte and it was one of the best I've had. The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food , great coffee and unique environment. One of my fav places for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd Strip property coffee shop/cafe I ate at this week. I was with some of my family as we were doing some sightseeing, and we needed some reasonably priced grub. We weren't going to shell out $20 for an entree, and we were pretty hungry so we stopped here. I thought the menu was pretty decent for a cafe/coffee shop, and because it was dinner time, we had our choices of food. I was excited they had a veggie burger, even though I didn't get one. It is hard for me to understand places like this that don't carry veggie burgers, not just vegetarians eat these...anyway...I had the nachos. They were $13 but the plate was massive and there was no way I could have finished these bad boys if it weren't for the others at my table.  Service was pretty decent, we had a couple awkward moments with the server, but its Vegas, so it happens.  If I am in TI and craving food again, this won't be a bad stop."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it was disgusting. Ordered the eggs Benedict and the hash browns had so much oil I could only take a few bites and even then at the end of the meal I felt globs of oil hanging out in the back of my throat. The hollandaise sauce tasted like whipped cheez whiz. I wouldn't care as much if it wasn't ridiculously overpriced. $16 for that mess. The person I was with had a similar experience with her all american breakfast. I get that Vegas is the land of indulgence but damn, son. Maybe the non breakfast stuff is better?"}
{"text":"I stopped at the Coffee Shop this morning after reading the yelp reviews.  I was torn between The Farm next door and this place since they were right next door to each other.  For whatever reason, I chose the Coffe Shop.... I had already been to Starbucks and had just a few sips of my iced coffee left.  Rather than let it melt in the car, I decided to put the cup in my handbag.  While waiting in line to order several breakfasts to go, the owner came up to me and said I was not allowed to bring in any outside food or beverages, as she had seen my straw sticking out of my handbag!  I found that to be EXTREMELY POOR customer service!  First of all, had I planned to finish my last few sips in her restaurant, would it really have made an impact on her business?  Secondly, I wasn't planning on drinking it in there, I merely didn't want it to melt, so I stashed it in my own handbag!!! Really???  I promptly left the restaurant and went to The Farm, which was absolutely delicious!!!!  The breakfast tacos are to die for!  In addition, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  A bit of advice, if you're ever faced with the decision of breakfast at the Coffee Shop or The Farm, don't hesitate.... GO TO THE FARM, you won't be disappointed:)  Vicky, Scottsdale AZ"}
{"text":"Love it! Everything here is great. The coffee, the cupcakes, the food, the atmosphere. I come here as much as I'm able!"}
{"text":"I came in to this place last Friday night. I had been there before and the food was good so I decided to go again but this time was awful. I ordered a Caesar salad and many pieces of lettuce were soggy so Bad they looked moldy already of course I send it back and didn't ordered anything else. My daughter ordered a cheeseburger medium well and the meat was so read blood was coming from it. My mom ordered a noodle soup since this is a Vietnamese restaurant too and it tasted so bad and smelled like they just threw water in uncooked chicken. Brother ordered chicken tender and they were dry and cold. All the food was so bad. Out waitress was giving us a good service but as soonest I pointed out the problem with my salad he took the plate got upset and never came back it took forever to get our check like it was our fault they're serving bad quality food. Never going back for sure"}
{"text":"Maybe it's my red velvet southern roots, but gourmet cupcake my ass.   Credit due for the fresh salads and garden. Cute place!"}
{"text":"Breakfast 24/7 is great. I love the French Toast and coffee.  Service is always gracious."}
{"text":"After watching her win on Cupcake Wars I was determined to find this place (It's very well hidden)and sample the cupcakes.  I have to say I was not impressed; i make better cupcakes on my own.  More creative and not so sweet you'll go into a diabetic coma.  i did have a California BLT as well and it was a good sandwich although the bread was a little too toasted for my liking.  The staff was friendly, the ambiance was very pleasant and it was clean.  But the cupcakes...really not all that.  Sorry...."}
{"text":"OMG this is horrible, I should have gone to Denny's. Their omelet is worst than the free breakfast from Hilton, latte is just stale coffee with froth, and pancakes... the only thing good about the pancakes is the maple syrup. I feel like I just got robbed after eating here. Probably not gonna eat in treasure island again."}
{"text":"My friends and I were plagued with some serious munchies after a long night of clubbing in Vegas and were on the verge of death by starvation when we decided that there was only one thing to do...yelp! Surprisingly, there weren't that many places open past 4am, which is when the clubs start clearing out. However, thanks to The Coffee Shop, which is located in Treasure Island (where we we were staying that night), we were all able to go to bed with quiet, content bellies that night.  I ordered the All American Burger with cheese (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dqSDQSjp4SjzYUYUFuj0gw?select=pNBSY2PapXDp4yFHvOmPGA#0N739LEDPk5Zrq-axukSMw). It was a good thing I was famished because that burger was ginormous with a mountain of fries piled next to it on the plate. I had the burger cooked rare and it was perfect. The fries with thin and crispy, but I wish there was a little more starchyness in the middle of the fries.  All in all, good place to grab some late night food, but it is on the pricier side. My burger plate cost $14 (and cheese cost extra...what?!?!), which I would not have been willing to pay for a burger had there been other cheaper food options around the area."}
{"text":"Amazing, especially for the East Valley. Their coffee has always been great - and they're one of the few places I've found that has butterscotch syrup! Butterscotch iced lattes are dreamy...  The Field Veggie sandwich is equally delicious. And their cupcakes are always dependably yummy - I tried the coffee and cigarettes one when they had it...so strange, but really good!  A really good find in the sea of Starbucks stores that is Gilbert.  Awesome atmosphere, too!"}
{"text":"Food is really good. It does get crowded on the weekends. I especially love the little farm stand outside of the coffee house on Saturday. Try the oro blanco grapefruit from said stand."}
{"text":"This is mine and my wife's new favorite place! Wonderful environment, amazing food and kind staff. I couldn't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Burrito Supreme-one word. Amazing!!  The combination of potato, cheese, chorizo, an egg is just right. My first time here and definitely no my last. The employees are pleasant and good vibe. This place is more than coffee. It is an experience."}
{"text":"I've seen some crappy reviews for this place, but we had a stellar experience. Is it overpriced? Yes! It's the Vegas strip! You could pay $46 for a banana here. So get over it and roll on. The atmosphere is simple and clean. The staff? Some of the nicest, most genuine folks I've found yet in Vegas. We came for dinner because we love pho noodles, and got a great meal, with tons of food. $5/beer with a bucket (ok prices for the area), and an appetizer of spring rolls with the shrimp and peanut sauce. They were decent, not really worth the $$ but still ok. We got pho with tendon, meatballs, and beef, which was awesome. Really pretty good food, with lots of basil and fresh jalapeño. The broth was tasty, not too salty. We also got some vermicelli noodles with egg rolls, which was not bad either - we were too stuffed to eat all of it.   At least for the pho, check it out."}
{"text":"Typical 24 hour diner-style restaurant. And this place is in connection to Pho at The Coffee Shop next door...Oh gosh I can't imagine how awful that would be!   Anyway it is good The Coffee Shop is at the TI. My girls and I stayed here and whenever us and our new found friends wanted to eat we just came here because it was open after the club !   The food options late at night are limited...I guess breakfast is what everyone goes for! Got the Ham & Cheese Omelette and was sort of disappointed how the cheese was literally a slice of Kraft's Cheddar Cheese just placed onto the omelette...It didn't even melt all the way....  The taste of the food is so bland. Lacks tons of flavor and I didn't feel like anything was wow about this place.   Mehh.... Go to the Grand Luxe Cafe across the street! Much better."}
{"text":"So why have I been to The Coffee Shop on so many occasions while in vegas?  Well: 1) I tend to stay at Treasure Island a lot, 2) I am usually drunk when I go here after partying, 3) It is on the way to the guest elevators, 4) it is open 24 hours.  Beyond those reasons, it is decent, greasy food for those late night drunk munchies.  Honestly, I am not too sure what I have tried here (hazy hazy nights that were mostly fun I think), but the one item that I remember sticking out the most, and my friends and I fighting over, were the fries.  For some reason, they were insanely good the many times we ate here post 3 AM.  If anything, get some 3AM fries."}
{"text":"My review is limited to breakfast only. Oh, and the cupcakes of course- that's what brought us to the Coffee Shop in the first place. We heard about the owners winning Food Network's Cupcake Wars and had to try them out. The interior is minimalistic, but works. The patio is excellent but a little on the small side- grab a spot early when the weather is nice because it fills up fast.  The cupcakes are excellent- my wife loves the classic vanilla and the strawberry. I prefer the red velvet. The frosting is light and sugary, the cakes balanced just right. Don't pass these up when you're visiting!  The breakfast is great- we've tried most everything on the menu and you cannot go wrong. The classic egg breakfast is a no brainer. The burrito with chorizo is also superb. The portions are enormous so come hungry.   The coffee is stellar- always spot on. I go for the iced caramel mochiatto. My wife likes the vanilla lattes.   What a great way to support local business, eat a great breakfast and hang out in the Agritopia neighborhood. The Farm Grill next door is another popular spot, and it's walking distance from the Coffee Shop."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast in all the land! Go for one of the breakfast plates, like the All American, and you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for something a little lighter, try one of their coffee cakes warmed up. The coffee is great, staff is friendly, and you won't find a cooler coffee shop anywhere in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Came here because of the convenience, it's right next to the elevator. The food is alright, but them prices...geeez...I mean I get it's The Vegas but come on! I got a plain waffle, by itself, side of hash browns, & coffee; my fiancee got pancakes (smaller than your hand)  with eggs, bacon and coffee our total was like $50! The service is alright also."}
{"text":"I really love me some cupcakes. So when I found out this joint was serving cupcakes made by winners from cupcake wars - I was like HELL YES. So were they nice looking cupcakes? Yes. But you know they were just not that tasty at all. kind of dry. I got a coconut and got the birthday cake for my daughter since we were sampling to possibly purchase for her birthday party. I really wanted to love them. But I didnt. I might go back for some coffee but for the mean time im sticking to Sprinkles for my cupcakes."}
{"text":"Adorable little spot, but was slightly disappointed in a few aspects.  Overall, It comes highly recommended, however I didn't notice the staff to be particularly friendly and the vegetarian options were almost non-existent. I ended up with a pretty expensive veggie sandwich that was nothing to write home about.  The atmosphere made up for it and the music was pretty decent!"}
{"text":"Nice cafe tucked away in a housing community. A few friends & I stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it wasn't very crowded at all. The place had a home-y vibe, with couches and books lying around. I got the San Diegan omelet, which was good, but a bit pricey. I also got one of their red velvet cupcakes, as I had seen that they were featured on Cupcake Wars. The frosting of the cupcake was perfect! The cake itself was moist, but it had a weird flavor to it, that I'm not sure was accidental or on purpose. I think if I had tried a different flavor, it would have been ok."}
{"text":"Service has been a lot better the past year or so."}
{"text":"We checked in to our hotel really late Saturday night and this place was the only restaurant still open. The cafe actually has two different menus. There's the typical diner food and a Vietnamese menu. We ordered the black bean burger, salmon, and vegetarian pho. Hands down the pho was the best choice. The portion was huge and everyone at the table loved it. The salmon and burger were just alright. The reason I didn't give this place three stars was because the service wasn't great. They definitely weren't understaffed but it took forever to get our waitresses attention."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their blended Chai lattes! The coffee shop's is probably top three on my list. It is such a cute little shop owned by two sisters (not a chain) and has so much to offer."}
{"text":"\"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world...\"  Oh, wrong movie.  This wasn't a gin joint, but a coffee shop.  THE Coffee Shop.  Kudos to TI for coming up with an interesting, creative, and artistic name for their joint.  Of course, if they knew what a coffee shop was in Amsterdam, they might have re-thunk it.  Having skipped dinner before going to the 9:30 Mystere show, it was bordering on 11:30 when we got out of the theater, and this Cinderella was hungry.  Not wanting to wait any longer, we learned that our choices at TI were pretty much limited to a hot dog place or the coffee shop.  With a heavy heart, we chose the latter.  I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't too disappointed, but sticker-shocked at the prices compared to our locals casinos.  And we were elated, yet wary, when we were seated and handed the regular menu along with a Pho/Cantonese one.  (Should that be faux Cantonese?  You decide).  Prince Charming and I both opted for Asian.  He chose a pho, thinking it came with shredded chicken.  But when it was delivered, it was filled with pieces of chicken on the bone, which he detests.  Our server, Phyllis, explained that he had confused the chicken in the pho with the one in the noodle dish, and cheerfully offered to have it redone with shredded chicken.  I ordered the noodle dish with beef.  I was expecting a nice, hot dish to stop me from shivering under the blasting a/c all over the restaurant, which was 20 degrees colder than the casino.  But what was served was cold noodles over a bed of lettuce, with room-temp beef.  Does the Board of Health know about their beef temperature?  Once again, Phyllis came to the rescue, offering to bring me a bowl of hot broth to dump my dish into.  That helped warm me up, but it wasn't until I stole the basil, bean sprouts, and lime from my husband's pho, and added a spoonful of the nam plak that came with my dish, that it had enough flavor to satisfy.  The Coffee Shop served its purpose.  The service was terrific.  It isn't terrible, just the equivalent of \"any port in a storm.\""}
{"text":"07/07/10  Had coffee and some sweets here w/ a friend, and after much anticipation on trying the fare here, I was a bit disappointed w/ what I found :(  I decided I'd try a couple of scones and a berry coffee cake, and a cup o' joe.  I really enjoyed the coffee, but the pastries?  Not so much.  The coffee cake wasn't sweet enough, and I found it to be too greasy.  The scones, also a bit on the greasy side, were so flat, they looked like cookies!  Out of the two, I liked the butterscotch best.  However, I wouldn't order these again.    A few hours later, I decided I'd go back to write some reviews and have another cup of coffee.  I went back up to see if there were new additions to the display, but was turned off when I saw a couple of flies crawling over the cupcakes.  (((shudder)))  The clerk manning the counter followed my gaze and saw the flies, but didn't shoo them away.  Tsk, tsk.  Turned me off on trying anything new.  I am a big fan of Joe's Farm Grill and The Liberty Market (a little less of Joe's Real BBQ, but I've only gone there once, so a return visit may change my mind), so I'd like to give their sister company The Coffee Shop another try.  The sandwich and salad menus look delicious, but most of the selections are off-limits to me.  But... flies in the sweets counter?  I don't know if I can stomach another visit :("}
{"text":"Service was not the greatest. We received the check after 2 bites of our food, which took some time to come out. Menu was a tad bit pricey, but it was delicious. We got the cheeseburger with fries since it was the best value item for a late meal. It was a good eat, or it could have been because it was about 1am"}
{"text":"Me and my husband are visiting from San Diego and coffee shops our favorite places. Finding this place was a true reward. Everything about this place was amazing!! I loved the lay out of how it was decorated and how much space there was even the outside seating area was nice. The food is truly fantastic their breakfast/lunch even their pastries I would recommend this place to any one to have an enjoyable time with friends and family. For food options I would suggest getting the breakfast Barito's they are my favorite and for a vegetarian get the vegan bagel"}
{"text":"Share the Indio on a croissant with your favorite person! It's the perfect portion to share and super delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hours and was our only choice after 2:30am at treasure island...the menu options were horrible and EXTREMELY OVERPRICED! service was super shitty and I kid you not once they saw me open the yelp app and start writing a review they bent over backwards to appease us...my one friend ordered the chicken strips and they were okay..the ranch was good. Unfortunately my other friend ordered the club sandwich which should be one of the easiest thing to make since almost none of the ingredients are cooked. It took 30 minutes to get our food (the restaurant was practically empty). When the chicken strips and club sand which were out the club was incorrect as we ordered it without tomatoes and it had tomatoes . It was sent back and took another 20 minutes to get back out to us. While waiting we tried to talk to a manager who said it would be right out even though at that point we just wanted to cancel the order.he basically ignored us.Next we tried explain that situation to a waitress who promptly ignored everything I said and walked away. The only saving grace this place gets is they did in fact give us the free sandwich but it was only after we repeatedly voices our annoyance at the       s$$$ty service. Maybe we caught them at a bad time but it was not a fun experience.  Plus it took forever for them to take the card so we could get the heck out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice spot for lunch!  The atmosphere is cute - a nicer coffee/sandwich stop!  Plus, they have great outdoor seating.  Very pretty outside - flowers, trees, cactus, etc.  For food, I had a breakfast burrito - it was tastey!  I would highly recommend this spot to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"My cousins and I all ordered the grill cheese with tomato soup and it had Gouda cheese and the tomato soup was just gross. Not worth the $16 plate each. The server was polite though I'll give you guys that. But let's just say I won't be back."}
{"text":"was staying at TI, ordered a $16 burger and frys here, soggy greasy fries and a steamed tasteless burger, would feel used if this was half the price, now feel both used and foolish for even going to this place"}
{"text":"When you're staying at TI and need something 3 in the am this is the closest place to grab some grub.  They have a limited menu; mostly breakfast foods and a couple burger/sandwiches.  The staff is friendly for it being 3 in the morning but the prices are a little high.  My girl and I needed something to put in our stomachs late at night / early in the morning.  Went down to look around the casino and found that this was the only open place.  She got the burger and I got the mushroom and cheese omelet.  Both dishes tasted pretty much like Denny's food.  That is no complaint tho, seeing as it was a spur of the moment, late night meal.  Pretty much its a place with decent food that is overpriced.  Don't really find ourselves frequenting this place during normal hours, just a place to grab something to eat when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the coffee shop! I've had several different coffee beverages and they've all been fantastic....and recently I had the devils food (I think that was the name) cupcake.....absolute heaven in a cupcake. It was so moist and the frosting was delicious. Highly recommend this place. Great for meetings as well."}
{"text":"The other reviews are right about the mediocre service and long wait to get in.  Sitting here now in a half empty restaurant with a long line to get in.  I arrived at 6:15 am and got right in. People have been waiting on average 15-20 to get seated.    I'll be hiking to the Pepper Mill the rest of my time here."}
{"text":"Love the location, staff is friendly and if you don't know what you want. Cashier would really help you out on what to choose. Outside seating is very clean along with interior.  Got the California Club sandwich and strait delicious. Can't wait to try their breakfast again."}
{"text":"This review is pretty much only on the cupcakes-- which are good. I have also had an iced coffee, which was really good.  So, the cupcakes are pretty good with some interesting and fresh flavors. But nothing spectacular and some are too plain. If I had the ambition and time, I could make better cupcakes myself. But they are still good. And still good enough that some of them are worth the 10 mile drive and the price. Good flavors included strawberry (with fresh strawberries), pina colada, and cinnamon bun. But the vanilla, which I expected to be awesome, was so-so and the frosting tasted mostly of food coloring. The red velvet was okay, but I won't get this flavor again. And the coconut was a bland vanilla cupcake with coconut sprinkled on top.    We eat next door at Joe's all the time, so I plan on going back for more coffee and other treats and will revise my review after more tastings..."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say the food was awesome, but they serve a decent BLT.  They must have stuffed in a pack of bacon in the BLT because it was stacked with that hearty pork goodness.  Don't order the clubhouse (same thing as BLT but with the added turkey) bc it's an extra $3 and the BLT will suffice.    Breakfast was alright.  Hash browns were too burnt for my liking.  Yes, yes, service is slow.  However, on my second time here, Marcel (i think) was quick to get us menus, take our orders, bring our food, and grab the check.     Also, if you sit in the back room, you can look outside the windows and watch the people at the pool."}
{"text":"I love the Coffee Shop. It is atmosphere mixed with food mixed with efficiency perfection.  Yes, there will always be a line but it's a Gilbert line so you're 7 people deep and thinking, \"Oh my gosh, this is insane! I'm practically out the door!\" but just hold up and hang in. It is worth it. The coffee drinks are great - iced mocha is my jam. Breakfast dishes are delicious. I recommend the Veggie Scramble. If you're feeling a sweet is necessary then definitely do not skip the cupcakes. Amazing! So, so good. Also, really cool people stop in....like probably everyone you know. I can never leave there without seeing a friend or friend of a friend. It's a good place to be!"}
{"text":"Cupcakes = amazing. This is the main reason I go there.  Got lunch once, and it was good but a little pricey for an ordinary sandwich.  Love the atmosphere and outside seating."}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 14 on a Sunday early evening. Although the place was half empty, the service was very slow. It took a loooong time for the food to be served. Looks like a good amt of reviews stated that as well, so be prepared to wait. The food though is actually good. Everybody enjoyed what they ordered: Beef brocolli, pho w rare beef, chicken pho, one of the pork Vietnamese sandwiches, spaghetti, pancakes, and hamburger and fries. Try the seared salmon, it's excellent! The prices are pretty high for the kind of food ordered. It's probably typical hotel pricing, and I saw a lot of these menu items on the room service menu...but even more expensive!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   The Coffee Shop opened when I was still living in AZ & was going to grad school in Mesa. Even though it was about a 15 min. drive from my school (and there was at least 3 Starbucks that were closer), when I had the time in between classes I would come here. I'm happy after all these years (okay...it's been like 5ish) The Coffee Shop is still around, and has actually grown. Not that I had doubts based on quality & service, but I still consider this location to be somewhat in no-mans land.   Even though I no longer live in AZ, when I come home to visit I have a friend who lives close by so I still try and drop-in when I go to visit them. Maybe I'm exaggerating this, but I think the place has grown over the years. There's tons of seating both indoors and outdoors, and there's even a cute little living room type area w/cozy couches. The atmosphere here is very clean & open.   Now for as much as I love coffee/espresso, I'm not a huge connoisseur of it, but that being said whether it be Chai or a latte the drinks here are great! What really sets this place apart from other coffee shops though is the food...particularly the baked goods! The scones, muffins, & cupcakes are all FANTASTIC! There's a huge open kitchen where you can see these delicious pastries being made! As far as the sandwiches, soups, and breakfasts, I can't really say much since I've never had any of that stuff but I'm sure they're yummy if they're anything like the baked goods!   The Coffee Shop isn't exactly located in the most central area, and I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here, but when I'm relatively close by, I make it a point to come here...even if it means bypassing other coffee shops along the way."}
{"text":"this place is just amazing! the owners are sweet and always remember our order. as someone from seattle, i'm thankful to have found a place with character and community that i can make a part of my daily rounds. i have yet to be disappointed.    top notch items to order:  san diegan california club lemon whoopie  they have great wi-fi, cozy leather couch and oversized chairs plus a dreamland garden in the back to hang out in. to top off the experience, their playlists are always impressive set with death cab, minus the bear, and the like."}
{"text":"$7 for a large orange juice. Ummmm...what?  That being said, pancakes, bacon and hashbrowns were pretty good, so we'd probably go here again."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is one of our two go-to breakfast joints when we're in Vegas. In terms of affordable and plentiful breakfast fare, The Coffee Shop can't really be beat. You can count on quick wait times and fast service no matter what busy weekend it may be. The staff may not be the most personable or the friendliest, but they are fast and have never messed our orders up.  I order the Downtown Breakfast Sandwich every time - I think the sandwich was personally designed for my taste buds, and I highly recommend it. My husband likes the Tower of French Toast, as it has different fruit varieties. They also have very inexpensive but heavily alcohol filled Mimomas.  We would never come to The Coffee Shop for anything other than breakfast because truthfully they offer standard sandwich and chicken tender type foods that we can find at home for a third the price, and there isn't anything memorable about the restaurant - it's very bare bones and diner-y. But breakfast? It fits right in and they do it well."}
{"text":"This review is for the Pho menu (dinner).  I love Asian pho and this place has it.  Aromatic and delicious.  The chef has got to be Asian to get it this right.  Loved my pho (say, \"fuh\") with tofu and vegetables."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Standard booth, table restaurant. Nothing really makes it stand out. No decorations.  Service: It was fine. Nothing special. They got you what you needed when you needed it.  Price: $16 for 4 chicken tenders. Biggest rip off in Vegas out of all the places  we dined. Note that they were frozen garbage.   Food: Nothing special about the food here. It was  bland, lack of flavor, and a lot of the late night menu is frozen stuff out of a bag. I ordered off their regular menu the Vietnamese spring rolls. The sauce had no flavor. Too much cilantro."}
{"text":"We come here almost 2 x a week and I keep forgetting to \"check in\".    Fresh baked goods everyday.  The best cupcakes that won Cupcake Wars.    This place is great for meeting your friends or clients.    Breakfast plates are awesome here.    Try the San Diegan omelette."}
{"text":"We were staying in the Treasure Island for our last night in Vegas so we wondered down around 7am before checkout. The place was not very busy and there was a hostess and what appeared to be a manager as we walked in.  Seated immediately but that's the only good part of the experience.  We waited forever for a drink order so we tried to just order our whole meal when the waitress finally appeared.  She said she couldn't do that yet but she'd be back.  Queue the Jeopardy theme song.....What is Piss Pour service, Alex?   We finally ordered and we both just got Denver omelets that came out slightly over cooked. It was still decent.  It came with hash browns that had no flavor except that of old cooking grease and sourdough toast which was a nice touch.  The cost for 2 omelets, 2 waters, and 1 coffee was 44.00. Ridiculous.  For a better meal and service visit any Denny's, Shoney's or Truck Stop in America at 3am."}
{"text":"Oh, The Coffee Shop. You have officially lost a cool point.   I usually get tea when I go here, because I am not an avid coffee drinker. My sister, on the other hand, is a coffee aficionado. She knows about different beans and flavors, and tries different cafes all the time. I've taken her here several times, and apparently The Coffee Shop does not make good coffee. Ironic.   The food is great though! But unfortunately they've started charging for extra salsa. I always used to get it for free.   A few suggestions:  1) Bring back free salsa!  2) Create a frequent cupcake card. I buy them all the time! It would be great to get a free cupcake with a purchase of 10.  3) Have a special price for a dozen cupcakes. My husband bought 12 for my birthday at $3 each. Do the math = $36 for cupcakes. Could you do a dozen for $30?  4) Pupcakes! Cupcakes for Dogs. I saw this at Heavenly Cupcakes in San Diego (which I also reviewed). People always bring their dogs to The Coffee Shop."}
{"text":"Good food, mediocre coffee (I don't understand the name) and really bad /slow service"}
{"text":"I was surprised, I thought this place would be a five-star yelp page.  We've loved every experience here.  Awesome breakfast burritos. A must try. Awesome cupcakes (they offer vegan and gluten free sometimes! Call ahead to see what they have that day if this interests you!) Awesome espresso and fruity/ smoothie drinks.  I use to love to come here on my lunch breaks to relax. Great atmosphere!! And I love the outdoor seating. On days with nice weather, it makes you forget you're in Arizona for awhile! ;)  Check it out, for sure!!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great. They won the cupcake wars.  The place is packed because the food is really good too."}
{"text":"$4 for a cup of coffee.... WoWWW.     I went with a minimal breakfast. Yogurt with fruit + granola.  Impractical presentation (beautiful but all the fruit was planted on top of the yogurt and it would spill out of the dish as I tried to eat the yogurt at the bottom).   Toast was a little cold...but I'll eat any bread and most of the time it will taste delicious.   $20 breakfast after tip... a little spendy even for Vegas."}
{"text":"I agree that the food is overpriced.  But this is Vegas...EVERYTHING is overpriced, yo.  The service isn't always great.  And although breakfast is served 24 hours, the regular dinner menu ends at 10:00p.  The ONLY reason I'm giving TCS a 4-star rating is because they have an outstanding open-faced turkey sandwich and mashed potatoes.  My wife and I love it.  We stop here every time we visit Vegas...sometimes twice.  Letter Grade:  B -"}
{"text":"Great coffee, tons of food options, indoor outdoor seating, great WiFi signal. Highly recommend as a breakfast spot for healthy (and unhealthy but yummy) options!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with my son and had a fantastic meal.  Yes, it's expensive, but food was really good, staff was so so friendly.  I came back a few hours later to have coffee and work on patio, and they kindly let me take a table for about an hour. Great staff!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little location. They have a small room where you can hold an event like a meeting or a baby shower.  Coffee was A+. I got a vanilla latte. Always hesitate to order espresso drinks at a new place because so many go crazy with the sweeteners.  The latte was perfect! No bitter, burnt coffee bean flavor and not overly sweetened.  Also ordered 4 cupcakes for a birthday. They were decent. Enjoyable but nothing stellar. The lemon and coconut were our favorites."}
{"text":"Oh my, I love the coffee shop! Best chai in gilbert and my has my favorite southwest chicken salad/sandwiche. SO good!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great coffee and breakfast plates. It's family friendly, but also a great place to sit down for a meeting or to get some work done. The Coffee Shop is always buzzing with customers, and has a good vibe. Plenty of outside seating. My only suggestion would be to try to create more seating inside because it can be hard to snag a table if you want to be inside with some AC.  Overall great experience every time!"}
{"text":"Best Chai latte with almond milk I ever had. Way better than Starbucks. Had breakfast here with my family just passing thru. My son and hubby loved the cinnamon rolls. Known for their cupcakes but I couldn't eat any being on a vegetarian paleo diet."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast there 5/10/16 while staying at TI. The first thing we noticed was the high prices. I had oatmeal with sausage and my daughter had an English muffin. The oatmeal was standard; nothing special. With it came raisins, whole milk and brown sugar. For $7.00 they should have included chopped walnuts or dried cranberries. The $6.50 sausage patties were horrible! They tasted like bland pork and one was overcooked.  The most annoying aspect of the meal was how the staff members kept standing behind me, talking. I got the distinct impression they carried little for the quality of the food or their service. We didn't go there again."}
{"text":"I would probably give this 3 and a half stars if I could. Wonderful atmosphere and I love the concept of Agritopia in general. The iced coffee was just decent. I'd like to come back and try some other drinks. The food menu looked good as well."}
{"text":"My friends and I were hungry after hitting up the club and surprisingly there are not many places to eat at that are 24 hours. All I could think of was Earls Sandwich but that was way too much work. Luckily we found out that Treasure Island has a place open all the time. The pho is only open until 2:30am or so but the american side is still open. The prices are jacked up cuz they know that at those wee hours, people are willing to pay. I got the club sandwich with fries and my friend got the chicken noodle soup. The food took forever to arrive and it wasnt even good. It was straight up average. The sandwich looked really good but after tasting it, the turkey was dry, the fries werent crispy, and the soup was just bleh. My sandwich alone was $15 so I thought that was overpriced even though portions were quite big. Well you cant really complain when you are starving and its 3am.   **TIPS** 1) Open 24 hours for the American food and located in Treasure Island. 2) Meh food and service but no other choice."}
{"text":"Damn the food here is disgusting. After a night out of drinking and clubbin at XS...  This was the closest spot open at TI. Opted to come here cuz they served \"breakfast food\" that was crap. It took forever to get seated even though there were plenty of tables. The server took days to get some water and get the orders down.  Then, the burger i got was dry and not fresh at all. Made me wanna yack ... along with 3 other dudes about 30 mins later. The omelettes look dry and chewy.   I can see why they're connected with the Pho place next door, no wonder both their service sucks, and so does their food."}
{"text":"Eh- pretty comparable to Perkin's, although not quite as bad as Denny's. I had waffles with caramel sauce and pecans. The waffle was hard and the caramel was too sweet.  Also, the service wasn't the best. I thought this was Vegas, not Laughlin."}
{"text":"Wowie, is this place difficult to find!  But it's well worth the journey of getting lost on my way there!  My friend and I went for lunch and we thought we had stepped into an alternate universe or the set of Desperate Housewives.  I had the tomato-basil sandwich and my friend the veggie and they were quite tasty (although we both agreed that the 9-grain bread really made them great).  The reason we stopped by the place was cause I heard that they had won an episode of Cupcake Wars and had to try them out for myself.  I got the coconut and lemon for my brother who loved it and he's not much of a dessert kinda guy.  My friend got the double chocolate-something-or-other and said it was good but too sweet for her liking.  Their frosting to cake ratio was spot on, I thought!  Their coffee was also very good, we both had iced lattes but will want to come back and try their \"monsoons\".  The prices are a tiny bit higher than my liking, but worth an occasional visit.  Overall fabulous place and will return with friends!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast and it was great. This place is top notch in my book I will have to come back here more often. Not to busy and a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"happened to be scoping out some dr's offices for my job in this area and stopped by this little place. The area first off is absolutely beautiful. It's in this fantastically gorgeous spot in gilbert surrounded by lots of greenery; trees, grass, flowers, all things that arizonans are not usually accustomed to. First impressions were that this place was slammed. Inside was rocking and it was a friday morning. Wide drink selection, good (not great) food. I had a supreme breakfast burrito. It wasn't the best, lacked some flavor, but the portion was huge and kept me satisfied. I sat in some cool upholstered chairs and just took in the ambience. Lots of students, but you see a lot of young families in there also. The place looks like it is being run by teenagers and the nicki minaj with +7 bass that popped on the stereo at 9 am confirmed that fact. Real cool place to hang out and get some work done. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a weekly stop for me.  I love the California club!  Coffee is great and the dessert selections are always amazing.  If you're in Gilbert off Ray and Higley you must stop here.  Off peak hours are the best times to go to avoid the long line.  Breakfast is also a great option here."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go after the Cosmo Dog Park. Love the San Diegan."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS GODAWFUL!!!!!!!! DO NOT GO....EVEN IF YOU'RE DRUNK AND DESPERATE....STAY AWAY!!   you're better off walking down the strip to the Denny's nearby if you're looking for a late night meal.  first, the wait can be a bitch since there are only a few waitresses working late at night. second, the orange juice is $7 for a glass!!!!!! WHAT THE HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL???  third, the breakfast plates are horrible...overcooked bacon and stale hash browns. luckily my friend was nice enough to get the bill for our table, but i still felt cheated and ashamed to eat such horrible food...and i was quite inebriated as well. definitely a PASS!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and a developed food menu! Everything a coffee and tea spot should have, with an elegant, windowy, and outdoorsy atmosphere"}
{"text":"I wanted to go to eat the Pho instead of the coffee shop part of this place, but it was noon and none of us have had breakfast so I just go with the flow. When we got it, they seated us far away from the cash register near the Pho side which I thought was strange. Got the menu and started looking at the choices and a lady came up to us to ask for our drinks. We all got water except my husband got an orange juice. She asked if he wanted a small or a large and he told her a small, but she then told him that a large was the size of our water which was probably less than 8oz. I was like what the heck, that's a large!?!? and it's $6!!?!?! What a rip off, but he got it anyway. I got some breakfast item that had meat in it. I don't even remember what it was and my friend got a sandwich. All in all, the food was basic and not good. Price was over the top and the lady who provided the drinks had an attitude. She dropped our water on our table and walked away and when she did take our water order, it was with an attitude. Two big thumbs down."}
{"text":"Opened 24 hours - had breakfast here before heading back to the airport.  Good breakfast food and nice service."}
{"text":"Came here to eat pho before we head to the airport because it was across our hotel. $12 for pho is pretty expensive to me but it was decent. My friend ordered a burger and the thin cut fries were delicious! The service is good and it didn't take too long to get our food."}
{"text":"Great coffee, breakfast and lunch. We visit this cute coffee shop often and hey are always consistent with food and drinks. Just watch what time you go because they get very busy and you could wait 30+ minutes."}
{"text":"Burrito with chorizo had far too much chorizo. I requested light chorizo yet it was so overloaded I couldn't see or taste the egg. Wondering why they say they will make it with light chorizo and yet they never do. I'd prefer you mention up front if there is no possibility in decreasing the amount used..... This prevents setting one up for disappointment."}
{"text":"I stopped here twice, since it was in my hotel and right off the casino floor. I had Spaghetti one night and it was delicious and breakfast the next time. Both were tasty and the coffee was delicious but not worth $4.00. Especially since you can't take the pot to your room.  My service was always phenomenal."}
{"text":"The only reason you go to coffee shop is because you have to. Either other lines are longer, everything is closed, or it's breakfast time. The service is kind of crappy. While the servers are friendly, they are always seem understaffed. The food is fine, nothing special."}
{"text":"Clean place nice to hang out. Chicken salad wrap was short on Chicken, would go back but insist on more chicken."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Agritopia neighborhood is this heavenly shop. The coffee is superb and the sweets are spectacular! It was worth the drive. Looking forward to more caffeinated visits."}
{"text":"We've eaten here for years at breakfast.  Breakfast and keno.  Never win but I play.  Started when this was Treasure Island and they served the \"bounty\" breakfast.  Eggs any style, toast, hash browns plus bacon ham or sausage.  We add a side meat and split it between me and my wife.  Usually got out for $25 plus $40 loss at Keno  $44.83 for the bounty equivalent with a short stack of pancakes.  OJ and coffee were $4, coffee.  It's got a little pricey for a breakfast.  Still good just more bucks and I still loose at keno.  We may find a cheaper place next time we visit."}
{"text":"Would it be to forward to say that I want to live here, on premises? I mean, is that allowed?  I love this place. How did I live before coming here?  Do you think Joe would care if I made this my new home?  Love love love this place.  I am currently sitting in the back writing my review and never want to leave.  Joe, if your out there, your awesome.  this place rocks!"}
{"text":"There is something about casino restaurants that I don't understand. Why, even when you're slow, only have one person serving food AND alcoholic drinks when you have 2 people manning the minimal entrance line, 3 people serving drinks and then letting you know they aren't allowed to bring the alcohol? What's the point of that? It slowed down our service by half an hour. What if a casino's goal is to get you gambling ASAP, but you're stalled by the terrible service? Hmm...  The food wasn't that great either. I expect to pay a lot anywhere I go in Vegas, but I at least expect you to go above the expectation of any restaurant. I might as well have gone to Fridays."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The atmosphere and layout is really cute, both outdoor and indoor. Their coffees, teas and food are so very delicious. Their employees are really friendly. This place is just great overall. The only single downside is the outdoor patio in the front tends to have a lot of flies and birds which can be annoying. Regardless, I've never been let down by this place and I've been coming here for the pat year. It's a must-try!"}
{"text":"I've been known to frequent the area here to visit Barnone (also 5/5 stars, FYI) for a late night out and have wanted to stop here for coffee for awhile. Well, today was the day and I wasn't disappointed.   There area here is beautiful. Agritopia is just north with their beautiful garden to walk through, plus the area has a Midwest farm vibe. With several places to eat and drink nearby, it's a great meet up spot too.   There's plenty of seating here both inside and out on the back patio. Parking can be tight. Free WiFi is also available (no password).   For this visit I ordered a triple chocolate brownie and a Cal-Cake* Americano iced. OMG - everything was great. The brownie was gooey and delicious and a good size portion. The coffee flavor was bold and not overpowered by any of the flavors. Even my girlfriend, who doesn't like coffee, tried it and thought it was bomb. Can't wait to try another drink here!   Had I known this place was known for the cupcakes I would have went for that but I wasn't disappointed. I guess it just means I'll have to come back again ;)  (*Totally forgot the name of the drink :/ but it's similar to this - comment if you know!)"}
{"text":"Finally, food grown on the farm and served up fresh, great coffee, free wifi, shaded outdoor areas for sitting and playing, all in one. I thought I was back in Portland for a minute. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I first heard about The Coffee Shop on The PBS Show Check Please. I decided that I would take the trip and see if it is as good as was stated on the show.  Of course I checked the Yelp reviews and they were very favorable, so my fiance and I decided to go for breakfast. The only downside was we didn't get there until about 12:45pm and they stop selling breakfast at noon Mon thru Sat.. Of course that was our issue. Sunday they serve breakfast all day.  Even though we were looking to have breakfast we got sandwiches instead. I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich on Sourdough Bread and my fiance had the Chicken Salad on croissant. Both sandwiches were excellent. Great flavor, fresh ingredients is how I would describe both of them. Now for those you folks that like loads of food when you go out to eat, these sandwiches were just enough, not too filling. Which left room for one of the incredibly lushish sweet delicacies that they serve.   My fiance had the Boston Creme Cupcake and I had the Lemon Cupcake with sparkles on them. All I can say is \"Forget About It\" these cakes were Fantabulous. You must get a sweet something when you go here. Finally, it's a little hard to find but it's in Agritopia subdivision on the north side of Ray. You will see \"The Farm Stand Market\" sign - turn here."}
{"text":"The honey walnut shrimp and beef chow fun was so good and the service was great there were so many people complaining while we were there about stuff being spicy. I guess wussies don't like authentic good food."}
{"text":"My family LOVES The Coffee Shop!   The San Diegan is sooo good for breakfast! Fabulous pastries and sandwiches, you really can't go wrong with anything they serve here. The turtle monsoon is one of my favorite things ever.  The atmosphere and service are amazing. It's a great place to just come hang out, have some good food and take in fresh air!   Can't say enough good things about it!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't need yet another review - it's awesome. We know. BUT I had to put a good word in for their FISH TACO FRIDAYS!!!!!!! Oh my oh my I long for Friday's 11-2pm ish.  I order Fish Taco's on many a menu and these rank in my top 3 of all time. 2 tacos, Special sweet sauce (lots), hot homemade tacos, crunch cabbage...FINGER LICKIN good.  $8.95 I think. It comes with a salad that I barely touched because it couldn't keep up with the tastebud party of the fish tacos. They should swap out the salad for something else more exciting like a summer corn veggie \"salad\" or something.    Anyway, my other MUST HAVE at The Coffee Shop is the scones! I've never ordered a scone in my life - but here they are unbelievable - soft - like glorified magic muffins.  The whoopie pies are pretty spectacular too.  I always get an iced mocha - and it's always just the way I like it.    P.S. The ambiance here rocks.  a great place to get some work done (wifi), chat with a girlfriend, baby-watch, or go on a lunch date with your 15 month old like I do (plenty of high chairs and nice people that say SHE'S SOOO CUTE!)"}
{"text":"I did not bitch it up to the manager. Just to clarify. I was very calm and spoke only the facts. That the bill showed we came at 945am when we were there prior to 9am because we had all looked to see how long before the Mirage pool opened (10am).   We were all having a good time, excited that we would get protein and I was going to get pancakes as well. Imagine, pancakes after south beach. I was working hard so this utlra-non food was going to be perfect to a day of lounging followed by crazy walking up and down the strip.   We started noticing that 3 tables who came later than us (way later, like after we had long placed our orders) were getting their food and exiting!  The server who gave us the liquids changed to another lady who seemed strung out and over worked but seriously, who complains before getting the food unless you're okay with spit and bodily fluids not from your own body. She had a stack of bills in her hands and were inputting info into the computer. We doubted that she even entered our order at one point.   Another lady from the counter got up to complain and it was obvious that we weren't the only ones fuming with empty stomachs.  To be honest, the food was pretty good except I recall someone complaining about some processed cheese but I was in already in food-coma to pay attention. After we ate, I was ready to complain. Two people of our party quickly made their exit but come on, I wasn't going to make a scene.  I found a manager who looked like she had something going on upstairs and explained all the facts. The waitress came over and confessed that she was having a hard time with ONE (1) customer (at the counter) and hence, she was slow in filling orders. ONE customer caused this.  The manager was only able to comp us 50% but that was good enough since our belly was filled.   No tips and we never went back."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Vietnamese food ever, the pho ga was cold and the bun bo xao gave me the runs. I highly recommend not going to this establishment."}
{"text":"What we have here is a fantastic uber chic coffee shop ripped right out a SoHo corner and slapped in a contemporary farm setting. The Coffee Shop offers a rapture of stupendous desserts and a massive menu of blissful coffee/ espresso drinks. The atmosphere and decor is smart and happening yet still keeping to its roots with exposed articles of the previous structure. I love love the ultra glamorous Jessica, all of that Chanel!"}
{"text":"My first coffee shop I visited since I moving out here and I loved it! The look was great, very diverse customers, and the food is really good. Especially the desserts! They have free wifi so I was able to get some homework done there as I drank my tea. Great vibe, great place definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I gave up coffee about 2 years ago.. most of the coffees I drink now a days make me jittery because its too strong.  The Coffee Shop has such good coffee, kind of like a mix between tea+coffee! I atmosphere is really nice and open.  We ordered their American Breakfast and chorizo burrito.    American Breakfast- eggs were cooked to perfection and the wheat bread was so good, not dry like most kinds.    Chorizo burrito- overall really good but too much potato.  Should opt for no potato next time.    I liked it so much I told my boyfriend we have to come for brunch this weekend!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place to enjoy a quick bite. Food was great. However did wait a little while to get a refill on drinks.  Othwer than that great stop"}
{"text":"*I've written a review for this place in the past, but that was about a year and a half ago, so I feel it's a good idea to revisit and revise.*  I've been frequenting The Coffee Shop for a year and a half now, at a rate of close to three times a week (sometimes more, sometimes less). Since becoming a regular, I've gotten to know the staff and their names, and they know exactly what I want every time I come in; although, that's pretty simple, as it's just a medium black coffee. Given that their drip system is a fairly standard one, you can expect the same brew every time. While I would love it if they went a bit more high-end in their regular coffee brewing, I can't complain too much. They source their beans from Mr. Espresso, which is based out of California. Would I prefer it to be something a little more local? Yes, especially given that most of their other ingredients for food is locally sourced; but again, this is a relatively minor quibble. If you choose to go the espresso route with a latte, cappuccino, etc., then you'll more than likely be satisfied. My guess is that most of the customers who frequent here wouldn't consider themselves to be coffee snobs, so I never really overhear much complaining on their part.   The Coffee Shop's ace in the hole, however, is their cupcakes. While I'm not a cupcake critic, I've never been anything less than pleased with what they have to offer. You'll find an assortment of unique and endearing choices, from Birthday Cake Cupcake to blueberry scones, and more. My personal favorite is the Red Velvet Cupcake, but I've also tried their signature item: Coffee & Cigarettes. While the name isn't the most appealing, it's what won them an episode of The Cupcake Wars, and I can see why.   Aside from sweets, they offer a pretty decent menu of healthy sandwhiches and wraps. However, if you can, go in the morning and grab something from their breakfast menu, such as The San Diegan. This open faced omelette will literally open your face with delight (whatever that means).   The only real drawback to The Coffee Shop can be summed up in the immortal words of Yogi Berra, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\" Given that it's situated on an idealic urban farm that tends to play home to the more hip and socially conscious crowd of Gilbert, you can expect to have to deal with long lines and relatively little seating due to the sheer number of humans. The inside decor and vibe is pretty open and rustic, as it's a converted tractor barn, complete with concrete walls, an open aired dining and seating area situated between two walls of near floor-to-ceiling windows, and a backroom filled with comfortable couches and chairs. The natural light poors in nicely, though it can create a bit of a glare at certain times of the day. Seating is available outside, but on hot summer days you'll probably have to fistfight someone for a spot indoors. Since it's also a coffee shop, you'll more than likely see idiots like me taking up a table for inordinate amounts of time while slowly sipping on their brew and typing away on their devices. That's just how it is, so be prepared and ready. Besides, if you're just getting a drink, you can always grab your beverage and take a nice walk through the beautiful urban farm area and enjoy nature a little. Your mom always says you need to get outside more.   In all, The Coffee Shop is one of the best destinations for food, coffee, and hanging out in the East Valley. Does it have its areas it could improve on? Of course; nearly every establishment does. However, there's a reason I come here most days to do my writing, so they're definitely doing something right."}
{"text":"We ate here twice while we were staying at Ti. The first time we were here the service was pretty slow on getting us our drink orders, they may have been understaffed though.  The food was good. One day I had a Ham and Cheese Omelette which was grea! I actually liked that they placed one of those pre-sliced pieces of cheese over the top of the omelette. Some people probably wouldn't like that, but when you've had a night of drinking, something about that 'fake cheese' (as I like to call it) is sooo good :)  Second time we were there I had the Cobb Salad, omg, fantastic! My husband had a Club Sandwich the first time and it was very good too. The portions they give you are hardy so you're payment won't go to waste. Defiantly give this place a try!  3 stars because there was some food on the ground and we had a sticky table one of the times."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and they have so many breakfast options and yummy looking pastries. Clean ingredients too which is very important to me. I had a breakfast burrito and my companion had a breakfast sandwich. Both were very good! It can get crowded and depending on the time of day the line can get long. Parking can be tricky too. Coffee options are great and their regular coffee tastes really good! Love the location. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Really homey and comfortable. Their food has always been good and same goes for the pastries. I keep trying to replicate the San Diegan but there's just something they do with it! Not much a fan of their coffee ironically, but for breakfast it's awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop to go to in Gilbert.  It's tucked in agritopia so it gives the feeling of a Midwestern small town.  Plenty of seating outside, not so much inside, but I have always found a seat.  It is usually busy, I have never been there when there has not been a line.  Friendly staff and great coffee!"}
{"text":"OMG stay away!!!  the restaurant was nearly empty but the service was sooooo slow. we waited probably over 40 minutes for our food. the server was always missing.  the nachos were salty. the cheese itself is way too salty. however, i did like how it had a slight kick to it.  my steak and eggs were horrible. i ordered medium rare but it came almost medium well. it was realllly hard to eat. it just didn't taste good.  i had to use A1 and ketchup to make it taste somewhat decent.  i heard from others that the french onion soup was super salty.  they added hot water (that was for their tea) to the soup to make it a little better.  never again!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. However we were treated very poorly by the manager in charge. Despite having more than 2/3s of the tables open, he refused to let people in. When I asked him about it, his response was \"this is my decision and you will wait as long as I see fit. This is how all Las Vegas restaurants works and you can leave and go wherever you want.\"  After waiting over 20 minutes to get to the front of. The line, a couple cuts in front of us and hands the manager some cash. They were promptly seated.  It is really unfortunate to see some mid level manager go on a power trip, abuse his powers, and accept bribes."}
{"text":"Went here twice for quick food. Seating took a while even though there were a lot of empty seats. Ordered the Denver omelette.  Not that good. I could have made a better omelette and I should have for the price I paid for it. The hash browns were decent. I did like the buttered sourdough.  Servers were nice enough but they disappeared for the rest of the meal and I couldn't even flag one down for water."}
{"text":"returned to The Coffee Shop at Agritopia today for the most perfect lemon cupcake I have ever seen and tasted. I will post a picture of my happy self eating it too."}
{"text":"Very very yummy!!! We ordered the papas grande burrito and it was absolutely delicious!!! The salsa that came with the burrito was to die for!!! We have also ordered lunch there and have been impressed with that also.  My only complaint would be the attitude of some of the girls that work behind the counter.  But other than that we have always been pleased with the food and coffee!!"}
{"text":"I just visited The Coffee Shop which is part of Joe's Farm Grill in Gilbert and it was awful. The service was terrible (couldn't make a sandwich correctly and the restaurant was out of meats and bread) and the cupcakes are no better than store bought or box mix cupcakes. The owners lost twice on Cupcake Wars and now I know why.   A tiny BLT and a Tuna sandwich (with maybe a tablespoon full of Tuna) with chips, two cokes and two small cupcakes were $30. I will not be going back to this place and I would recommend that you not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Love the location, but their coffee just isn't good. I have ordered iced mochas from here a few times and they are drinkable like McDonald's, but not good and certainly not worth the money you pay. Food is overpriced and again it's decent, but not good. Best thing here are the cupcakes and obviously location. Wish it were a better review."}
{"text":"mann what a bummer!!   this was the second time i came to this restaurant cuz i remember i thought it was delicious the last time i came to vegas... but clearly i must have been really drunk when i ate there the last time cuz the food was NOT as good as i had thought it to be.  i almost felt bad cuz i raved to my friends that this place was pretty good and even better cuz its right downstairs from our room.  i ordered the cobb salad and was SO shocked that they did not have honey mustard dressing.. who doesnt have honey mustard dressing??!  so i sadly settled for the balsamic vinaigrette which definitely...does NOT taste very good with a cobb salad.  i ended up mooching off my friends quesadilla and chicken caesar salad because i didnt like my dish.    the only good thing about this place was that i wasnt able to eat a lot.. which allowed me to get more drunk when the time came to pre-party before going out. haha."}
{"text":"Good location and good if you're dying for hunger. Place has an identity issue. It's an American coffee shop with steak and eggs and they also serve Vietnamese food and lot of fancy dessert.  I opted for their Vietnamese menu and. Their Pho was ok, but as expected overly expensive. The soup wasn't hot enough and the vermicelli was still on the raw side. You do get the standard assortment of meat, beef balls, tendon, etc and a big dish of bean sprouts with lots of jalapeno peppers.  Their fried spring rolls was overly greasy as you can see oil spots on the lettuce. Their ice coffee was strange. You would assume for that the ice coffee would be served Vietnamese style (drip style with condensed milk). Instead, you get regular coffee with some ice in it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Papa Grande burrito and their Waffles are to die for! Those are the only two things I've had from here but I bet you couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop is my favorite coffee shop in the valley, though I more often go to Coffee Rush.  There's now a plant nursery happening on the outdoor patio, which has been modestly expanded to include more seats among the plants in partial shade.  Excellent no-hassle wifi.  The Caramel Deluxe is delicious hot and iced."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now and it is a must when I go to Vegas for breakfast or brunch. The place is clean, roomy, comfortable, prices are better than Denny's, large food quantity's, and the food tastes good. They have the classic All American Breakfast items. This restaurant is Half the Coffee Shop and half the Pho restaurant so don't get confused when you go in. Nothing out of the ordinary which is what I look forward to after a long night in Vegas which is a good All American breakfast."}
{"text":"The coffee was good.  The coconut cupcake my wife and I shared was great."}
{"text":"Best Chai Tea I've ever had. So much better than any other coffee shop I've been too, even Starbucks. The staff is so nice. I attend bible studies here and they are very respectful."}
{"text":"We come here every Saturday morning..favorite breakfast place in Gilbert! Scenery is beautiful, located right next to a beautiful little farm. The patio is very nice and food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The coffee shop is such a cute little place! They have a nice atmosphere with top to bottom windows in the main area which is prefect for chatting and catching up with friends and a separate quieter back area that's perfect for working on something. They also have an amazing outdoor area, with plenty of seats and shaded/ unshaded areas. The workers are friendly and the coffee is delicious. My favorite drink is an Iced black & white. Their food is good too! They have a healthier styled menu with mostly sandwiches/ salads and wraps but there's still plenty to choose from. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I've had to send back my sandwich a few times when I've asked for no onion and have gotten it anyway, and one time they didn't switch the bread so I could still taste it, but it's always been a quick fix! Love it here!"}
{"text":"I come here because it is one of the few independent coffee shops around and the ambiance is really nice. The chairs in the back are comfy and I love the decor. The hot chocolate is great. The sweets also taste good. The only bad thing is there are ALWAYS flies on their baked goods. I have come in multiple times to get a cupcake or a whoopie saw the flies on them and turn right back around."}
{"text":"Rare find in the East Valley!  Cute Cupcakes and the place definitely has character!  I ate a coconut cupcake with sprinkled coconut and glitter on top. I only bought one cupcake and took it hope to share with my 3 roommates. It made me wish I had more cupcakes to share with the rest of them! We took our forks and gulped it down.   The pink frosting was delicious and melted right in our mouth. The cupcake itself was very rich and moist. They must have substituted milk for the water while baking it, I could tell, so moist and mouth watering.   I will be coming back here to eat for breakfast and lunch. Its a great place to study."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here right after clubbing.  We shared the spaghetti with meatballs dish along with the breakfast dish that included eggs and bacon.  Our food came out rather quickly, probably because we came during the slow hours of the day.  The breakfast dish was alright, nothing great about it though.  The spaghetti was good.  But the price for everything was not worth it."}
{"text":"We ate here because we didn't have much of a choice.  Our flight arrived late due to a delay and we were desperate for a hot meal.  Though we could've driven off strip to some place far better and cheaper probably, we just wanted something quick and within TI, where we stayed.  So that leaves The Coffee Shop.  The service was slow even though it was 4 AM and 75% of the restaurant was empty.  My husband ordered their club sandwich, which actually was not all that terrible.  I ordered the ham and cheese omelete.  It came lukewarm and with a slice of processed cheese on top.  It was bland and pricey."}
{"text":"Love love love coming here for breakfast and coffee just wish that had more gluten free options!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to checkout the cupcakes. We got the red velvet, mixed berry, vanilla and coconut. I got the red velvet for my son. I'm not a fan of red velvet but he said it was moist and the frosting was not too sweet. I had the mix berry which was also moist but tasted tangy at the end. I'm guessing from the frosting and berry which was different.   I'm not a fan of frosting especially on cupcakes because usually their too sweet and there's too much. This one was kinda gritty, don't know if that's how they wanted to make it. I did take some of the frosting off the top, which surprisingly was not overly sweet."}
{"text":"The whole area over here is awesome. The Coffee Shop offers delicious Artisan sandwiches and coffee/tea drinks. It can be very busy during lunch time, so be prepared for crowds."}
{"text":"Finding this place at the Treasure Island, I had no idea that it would sell Vietnamese food like pho! Apparently they don't serve pho until past noon. I did not have an issue, as I arrived around 2pm. It wasn't so busy when I was seated, and I was seated rather quickly!  The space is really wide, and they have an indoor and outdoor section with tables.   While the food took a little longer to come out, but not too long, the service was really helpful and friendly! They kept our waters refilled consistently and apologized about the wait times.  I like the Vietnamese drip coffee. Yummy and strong!"}
{"text":"The place is literally next door to Joe's Farm Fresh Grill.  I didn't see a sign on the building for it.  It has a hip and trendy vibe and sometimes long lines.  The food is good.  Even though they won a round of Cup Cake Wars, I didn't think they were great.  Also wasn't a big fan of their coffee.  The food was very good though and I loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would give the place (4) stars except for the fact that they do not have any gluten-free bread or cupcakes. If you do not eat gluten you are sorry for choices here. In this day and age there should be some choices for limited diets. Don't even get me started on the make-shift salad. The greens did not look fresh and the tomatoes were lackluster. The dressing was the best part of the salad. The tuna salad was good but it did not make up for the caloric difference of a sandwich at the same price. Love the staff but sorry management-owners, get some GF options!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. For the longest time it was like my second home, I could walk and be there in 20 minutes. Their food and pastries are always the same great quality, and their tea/lemonade is so refreshing. However I feel like the staff could all smile and be a little more friendly. Such an amazing place, the vintage decor and small succulent plants on each table really tie the whole thing together."}
{"text":"I have been going to The Coffee Shop since they opened their doors. I absolutely love the cozy atmosphere, and lively setting. I never have to give my name when ordering because they always remember who I am. The food is so delicious.,the cupcakes are unique in taste, and addicting! I love the breakfast burritos as well. My kids also love going, and have grown up enjoying all the different things they have to offer. you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"We love having a local coffee shop with actually delicious coffee drinks! The quality of the beans, correct preparation of the drinks, including the equipment used, and knowledgeable baristas to prepare the drinks is key. Garrett is the best- he makes them beautiful as well as delicious! The food is also incredible: homemade granola, pappas grande burrito with eggs, bacon, potatoes and cheese (and their amazing tortillas!), many sandwiches and wraps with your choice of breads.The sweets case is full of scones, cupcakes, and cookies, too. Sitting outside in cool weather is a treat, as they have a rose garden, and potted flowers, and it's quiet, as it's not right on the street like many coffee shops. The line on the weekend shows, it's worth the wait- so come early to avoid the line! Or come on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Time went: August 23, 2010 Monday 3:30 AM  Don't and I repeat, DO NOT ever go here!  Unless you love: -Ridiculously slow service -Crappy staff -Overpriced food  Yes, we are in Vegas, everything is overpriced, but the food here are like Denny's and iHop, but with a lot less variety. We went here because it was the only thing open in the hotel and we were dead tired with walking, so we settled at the Coffee Shop. First thing I noticed, there were 1 group of 3 in line waiting, but there were 4 staffs talking to each other by the cash register while 2 servers walking around getting stuff, and TONS of open tables. But we got in about 5 minutes. We sat and 1 minute later the waitress came and asked if we want anything to drink. We got water and was still looking at the menu so we left it at that. We waited for 15 minutes, but no water and no service. There were now 6 staffs talking at the cash register and the waitress just passed us by twice without looking at us. I tried to flag any staff down, but no one came, so we just left. When we left the staffs by the cash register looked at us with mean look.  We went to the convenience store in TI instead to get beef jerky water and chips."}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time and loved the concept and neighborly feel.  Then it felt like the owners started to not put in much effort in training the staff & caring about the customers.  Our orders were continually messed up and staff seemed clueless and sometimes rude. We felt it was too expensive to continue to be disappointed so we stopped going."}
{"text":"Had a double expresso was really smooth, not acidic, not pungent, and a nice well balanced expresso smooth roasted aftertaste, best expresso on the east side hence the 5 star"}
{"text":"Best local coffee shop in Gilbert. Solid selection of specialty coffee drinks if you're into that, and the food options rock. Their iced Americano MIGHT just be my favorite. Ever."}
{"text":"We ate there several times and it was very good. The food is really consistent. We experienced it different times of the day, night and very late night and it was great each time!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere to grab a coffee with someone and hatch out some conversation, and digging into your homework. Amazing food always being served here that the Coffee Shop.  The award winning cupcakes are a must have in every visit. I love the homemade touch and all organic ingredients that is in every meal here. The only downside is the attentiveness of the employees and friendliness as well. Other than that, another great experience at the Coffee Shop."}
{"text":"The almond chai is the best chai latte I've had. Their espresso is fantastic. I don't need to talk about the pastry selection here because it's fantastic and anyone could tell you that. I definitely recommend the San Diegan for breakfast. They also have a great tofu eggs benedict. Try out their prairie bread toast! Everything is always delicious."}
{"text":"Mmm. Breakfast at 4:30am. How fun.  After being out late and our bodies still not adjusted to Vegas time, some of my friends and I stopped at The Coffee Shop for some \"breakfast\" food. My experience with it wasn't as bad as some of the previous reviews... but I thought it was okay.  My friend got the gardener's delight and I chose the mushroom omelet. Both were pretty good and HUGE. Nothing too interesting, and for the price, I was hoping for something a tad more inventive? Nonetheless, a hearty breakfast- came with toast and hashbrowns... so not bad at all. I definitely felt the oil starting to sit in my stomach.. but what do you expect for a 4am breakfast?  The service was fast and we were seated quickly. However, as one of my friends was being a tad belligerent, the waitress was giving us evil looks as the rest of my friends were fine. Nonetheless, service was fast, and the food was okay. I guess with the name \"Coffee Shop\", I was hoping for something a bit more inventive?"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with my mom and I was pleasantly surprised. The food is really good and reasonably priced. Of course, we had to try a cupcake, so we split a cookie dough cupcake and it was to die for! I can't wait to go back and try another flavor. The staff is really nice, but honestly, my favorite part was the music - Elliott Smith, Beck, Radiohead, Beatles...it doesn't get any better than that for me. I could have sat there all day listening to my favorite music while eating delicious cupcakes :)"}
{"text":"When going in and seeing a fairly long line, I knew it meant that the food was going to be good. The service was quick, and they were flexible with my order to accommodate my needs. Cute area, amazing food, and great blended coffee drinks! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome patio (and super cool indoor seating) for enjoying a coffee with a yummy pastry."}
{"text":"Busy place and wish they would open earlier on weekends, BUT they have excellent coffee and my absolute favorite breakfast item is the San Diegan open faced omelette"}
{"text":"This place is a gem, and their pristine outside patio is perfect for morning lattes when there is a scent of chill in the air.  The wife and I popped in based on an article she had seen.  I know the following statement has no business being in a business review, but the cashier had the bluest eyes I've ever seen, and it took everything in me to refrain from asking if they were real.  The Lemon Whoopi was a great little cream-filled, sponge cake cookie.  But the real shining star was the Cinnamon Cupcake.  Amazing concentrations of cinnamon sugar were dispersed throughout the cupcake, delighting me bite after bite.  The frosting was creamy, with a little crust of sugar, adding to the consistency.  It was simply wonderful.  I simply must try to recreate this award winning pastry.  So Joe, if you're reading this, we can do it the easy way, or the hard way.  You could bestow the recipe for this little treasure, and I could sign an NDA, and it would be our little secret.    OR... I could assemble the greatest axis of cupcake aficionados this side of... um, a place that would be notorious for cupcakes?  Then, after purchasing hundreds of these treats, and returning most of them to my team for careful analysis, could come up with the same recipe.  The ball is in your court Joe, but be forewarned: I wont wait forever before soliciting my hench-women.  PS: Applications now being accepted for cupcake hench-women."}
{"text":"I went here thinking this was the Pho Restaurant. The website is a little misleading. It wasn't until after I ordered that I realized it was directly next door. The hostess did not point me in the right direction. Oh well, my loss.  This is just your average coffee shop with average food. I had 4 people in my group. We ordered: The rustic grilled cheese, 2 Clubs and french toast. All of it was good, nothing special. The service was good and fast.  I would return if I was in the hotel and needed a fast breakfast."}
{"text":"The worst place to eat! PERIOD! And let me explain why...  Went here 6:30 am, got seated quickly, lady asked us what we wanted to drink, got our drinks rather quickly.... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... ....  15 MINUTES LATER...WHERE THE F IS OUR SERVER?!?!  Finished our coffee, walked out...  Please do not eat at this overpriced shit hole! Go to Mr. Mamas outside the strip, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Really yummy cupcakes. That's about all I can really say for this place. Service has always been pretty sterile and very young. It's Gilbert so the personalities of most of the people there are kinda blah. Welcome to Gilbert.  This place keeps falling off more and more each time I go."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! They have a super veg friendly menu. I've been a few times and tried something different each time - always amazing. Their vegan sweet treats are delicious! Love the setting, super relaxed. Totally recommend this place. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Awful experience at the overpriced coffee shop at the Ti coffee shop. All the pricked were about $20 so I rested the $21 steak and eggs. The steak arrived burnt to a crisp even tho I asked for it rare. I tried to get some steak sauce to cover the Burmese but has to walk around the restaurant to find sauce since our waitress disappeared. Ended up sending it back but it took so long to find someone the rest of my party was done eating already. I don't know why they have to take the whole plate away when they can just try and cook a steak correctly only. So ended up leaving hungry and completely dissatisfied. Lots of cheaper better options out there. I will never be back here or back to the TI for that matter."}
{"text":"It was a perfect day to sit outside in the patio enjoying the Bacon & BBQ sauce cupcake from the Food Network \"Cupcake War\" Challenge.  The thought of BBQ sauce on a cupcake doesn't sound very appealing, but surprisingly it wasn't too bad.  Joe's BBQ sauces are good by itself.  The cupcake was moist and with some unique flavors.  I just couldn't resist not trying it.   The view of the farm was gorgeous too."}
{"text":"The food is great for a night after partying (or not). They have this chocolate cake...it is to DIE for! YUM!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place!!! My family and I love the Cup Cakes. My favorite is the chocolate peanut butter. The topping is a peanut butter frosting adorned with chocolate sprinkles. No mistaking peanut butter in this frosting. The cake is chocolate yum and super moist! I've also had the red velvet, vanilla glam and the coconut. All are great! They also serve other sweet treats which I'm tempted to try but the cup cakes always reel me in first! The atmosphere and friendly staff is great too! The only con is....it's super busy...hard to find parking on weekends but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Staff is super friendly. Decor and atmosphere are incredible and definitely a nice change from the usual coffee stops. Iced latte was great and less expensive then most places."}
{"text":"My family and I lived in Gilbert for two years and The Coffee Shop was our favorite breakfast place (although their sandwiches are equally delicious!). Consistently yummy food and beverages, the staff is always friendly and courteous. Very dog and family friendly. You must try their peanut butter cupcakes and Spanish lattes! I have moved to San Diego and while there are great places here, nothing compares to The Coffee Shop! We miss you guys!"}
{"text":"Pho was available at 11am. It was pretty good for Vegas. Our waiter, Justin was great. He was very accommodating.   I ordered pho Bo Vien and mein ga and shared both bowls with my friend so we can try both of the broths. I was impressed on the taste of the broths. They also have Vietnamese coffee too!"}
{"text":"That was the worst serving i got for my vegas trip.ive  been waiting to make a order for 15mins. ive been called waitress for 3 times. Her name is  Cristina.a oldder phillinos lady.she just busy with filling chopsticks n spoons on the table .i called her 4th time...finally she came...n 1st she said :u can not wait? i said im sorry i cant wait any more cuz ive been waiting for 15mins already .she got really bad attitude."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food..  The soup was so salty that the waiter had to bring out a kettle of hot water for all the guests and warn everyone that it was \"a little salty\". The chowder eventually turned to a broth. Also the main dish sucked too.. My dish came out cold.    The servers were rude and every time we tried to ask a question they would cut us off. They charged us extra on the bill without informing us either.   Seriously worst place I've eaten in Vegas. The buffet at Treasure Island is 100x better and costs about the same as well."}
{"text":"A+ place for a quick breakfast.  I had pappa's breakfast burrito with a whole slew of stuff in it. Eggs, potatoes, bacon, salsa, sausage maybe?  It was very very good.  Eggs were cooked well and that flavor was great.  Thick cut bacon FTW (for the win).   Also had a small cookies and cream monsoon (frozen drink) and it was good as well.   Service was quick and polite with the food coming out quickly.   Atmosphere wasn't anything amazing but it was clean and not too loud.  The small is a bit small and can probably get crowded if there at peak time.   My only complaint.. the place is clean.. however, there were flies, 3 or 4, all over us while we ate.  Just buzzing around, irritating the crap out of me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed here. Has the baker changed? Their cupcakes sure have. My 3 year old granddaughter wanted a birthday cupcake because of the sprinkles on top and the funfetti. That's where the magic stopped. The cupcake inside was bone dry! Do they don't make them fresh daily? This one was like day day day old."}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN my absolute favorite place for breakfast in Arizona. I was born and raised in the Valley and nothing compares to this spot!"}
{"text":"Yum! they have the best  chai tea latte i ever tasted...my taste buds screamed for more after every sip.  chai tea in it's basic form is black tea that is brewed strong with a combination of spices and is diluted with milk and sugar. next time i will be sure to try the coffee!  as for the food we have tried the papas grande burrito (eggs,potatoes and a little bacon) and it was fresh and delish. I have yet to try their desserts.  the cupcakes and scones are a big draw at the coffee house. in fact the cupcake wars will be making a stop at the coffee shop this month and will air june 29th."}
{"text":"Small breakfast menu....probably a better place for lunch due to more choices. I got the San Diegan omelet (which the cashier said was their best seller). It was nothing spectacular and needed more veggies.  I also got the iced coffee and thought it didn't taste that great. However, the cupcakes I took home to eat later were pretty tasty. I might return for lunch one day for a sandwich ."}
{"text":"Regret going to this place, it was late...we just got back from seeing a show and didn't really want to go anywhere else but stay in our hotel,  as we had to get up super early the next day.  The food was mediocre and service was weird!  They bring you the check before you're even done eating and our server did not bother to asked as if we wanted anything else.  I had their omelette and the egg seemed like it was just soaked in butter, almost made me want to gag!  Do yourself a favor...you're better off going somewhere else to grab a bite to eat...this place is not worth it...even if you're hungover and drunk!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Coffee Shop.  Nice atmosphere, some outdoor seating, the inside is very cute. I've been here before and had coffee and it was quite good.   I came the other day for lunch, and I had the vegetarian sandwich. It was excellent!  I believe it had pesto, avocado and other veggies, very good!  I also ordered a cherry cupcake. The cupcakes got five stars for the beautiful icing, but I was not as impressed with the taste. I have had better icing and better cupcakes. Don't get me wrong it's still good, but I'm a baker and a bit picky.   I do think the coffee shop is a great place to go and have some coffee and a little light lunch and relax."}
{"text":"The food is good (a little overpriced)...the sweet treats are phenomenal (fairly priced)! There have been a few times that I've been in and the customer service hasn't been the greatest, which is always such a turn off for me. The whole setting gives off a hipster vibe and let me tell you, they are overloaded with these folk! One other thing that really grinds my gears about this establishment is the seating situation. I've gone in and first hand witnessed individuals (WITHOUT food or beverage, not even free water) just sitting at a table meant for 4 working on their computers. GO TO THE LIBRARY OR YOUR OWN HOUSE! If I were the manager I'd make it a rule that the coveted tables are reserved for people that are actually eating! This isn't Starbucks after all! It's ridiculous to expect paying customers to sit outside in 115 degree weather because some yuppie is working on editing their Instagram pictures...(end rant)"}
{"text":"Food is amazing here. Love the omelette for breakfast, or any of the great sweets. Southwest chicken sandwich is one of the very best anywhere."}
{"text":"I can only attest to their iced coffee, but it was delicious.  The pastries in the case left me drooling and my eight year old begging for one."}
{"text":"Well now just conveniently located by joe' grill....a nice little coffee shop....the staff...well....good looking young kids serving you tasty cupcakes (one young buck had a crazy hairdo and seems like eye candy for the cougars). Anyways...gf and I got a whoopie cookie, red velvet, and a ginger cupcake......all delicious except i couldn't taste the ginger...she is saving it for work...booo. So good for family and emm...cougars and teeny boppers."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here all the time and have never had less than excellent food or service. It is our absolute favorite breakfast place and the bacon is to die for!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the inside seating is very limited, but the patio space is pretty big.  The prices are definitely on the high side.  Now for the quality of this place and for what they charge, and being in Phoenix, I'm extremely disappointed that they don't have misters or outside fans or evap coolers to keep their clientele comfortable.  I won't be going there again any time soon.  It's no fun to be miserably hot and today is far from our hottest temperatures here."}
{"text":"The coffee is pretty good and the place is always busy. There are always pretty girls here, but it can have the pretentious vibe too. The food isnt bad either, but i can only speak for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving TCS 2 and 3 stars: my breakfast sandwich was good and the music and decor were really good.  The 2 stars would be for THE WASTE: so many disposable containers and no recycle bin. Additionally, they still use styrofoam!  What's more, this is a coffeehouse and my latte was burnt and bitter.  I wanted so to love this place."}
{"text":"The Coffee Shop has the bones to be the best coffee/breakfast spot in all of Arizona--but it has one big flaw. The coffee.   Walking up to the counter, you'll see a mass of oily, dark black, oak-roasted beans from Mr. Espresso in the hopper, and they produce an espresso shot that can only be described as a punch in the face (there's a reason they're the only ones in America roasting \"coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood\"). Harsh is an understatement.   But the food really is wonderful. Seriously, if they ditched the coffee and renamed the place The Omelette Shop or The Pastry Shop, it'd be a no-brainer 4-5 stars. But it's The Coffee Shop, and as a place that serves coffee, it's just not that good."}
{"text":"What an adorable little place!  I received a gift certificate to this place and decided to use it and meet up with a friend for coffee and breakfast.  We both ordered the San Diegan open omelette.  It was delicious. The only complaint was the bacon was a little bit fatty but otherwise we both enjoyed it very much.  I also enjoyed my caramel macchiato. I will definitely go back to try one of the yummy looking cupcakes.  We enjoyed our meal on the outdoor patio since we are experiencing such wonderful weather at the moment.  Great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Okay, not sure if my review is going to be fair, because i just ordered hash browns (and who can go wrong with hash browns).  But this place did not look good.  There didn't seem to be anything on their menu that had any nutritional value and It was not difficult for me to order nothing else but hash browns.  Again, you've gotta take this review with a grain of salt cause hey ---- maybe you're just into food with zero nutritional value....."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not given enough credit! I can't believe it only has four stars. Every single time I come here I know my coffee will be fresh with great taste. Great coffee and great cupcakes made fresh with all organic products  So if you haven't tried this place before I strongly recommend you give it a shot"}
{"text":"I work from here a lot and love it, especially when the weather is nice to sit outside and look at the farm.   I'm not a coffee drinker, but often get a chai  or matcha with almond milk. The pomegranate tea is good, as well.   I recommend eating the Field Veggie sandwich on 9-grain bread with a side of greens.   Stay way from the desserts; they look pretty but most of them are dry and tasteless. Yes, some are gluten-free and whatnot, but still bad for that, in my opinion.   This place has friendly staff. Often they are really busy and the line/wait could be long.   For the love of all things beautiful, please bus your own table when you leave, as intended. Especially if you're outside, so the rest of us don't get attacked by birds. (From experience)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to kick up your feet, get some good coffee and read a book - this is it. If you're looking for a place to grab a seat, pull out your laptop and get some work done - this is it. If you're looking for a place that has some killer cupcakes - this is it (or so I've been told).   The only reason I'm giving this place four stars is because of personal preference. I'm not a cream cheese frosting kind of a guy and their cupcakes are almost exclusively frosted with that stuff. They do have other options for something to go along with your coffee, but I've only tasted the cookies, and they're just about ok.  I've also had lunch here on occasion, and although nothing I've had stands out, nothing I've had disappoints.  All-in-all, if you're looking for a place to catch up with a friend, catch up on some emails or catch up on some reading; look no further. Great ambiance, friendly staff and cool vibe."}
{"text":"great late night/early morning quesodillas quick service  they have fresh squeezed orange juice which is my no1 hangover cure.  comfy booths to slump in while nursing said hangover"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo yummy!!!!! Their vegetarian sandwiches just hit the spot! Their coffees are pretty good and their desserts are very tasty! I have been for both breakfast and lunch many times and always recommend it! There is indoor and outdoor seating. Parking can be a little bit of a pain in the butt. Very busy popular place, but still manages to keep a quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"The BF and I went out to this place this morning/afternoon to get some coffee and try some of their famous -ish cupcakes. The coffee was good, strong, but not too strong and the latte was prepared fairly well. The cupcakes, however, were nothing super special. I got the pina colada and the BF got the something glam cupcake (?)...the cakes were very pretty with glitter and sprinkles, but as far as flavor goes...it wasn't that great.  Definitely no reason to drive out to BFE....now, if you live in BFE, at least you have a coffee shop that's not starbucks and is fairly good. So there's that. and the surroundings are pretty and a nice change from Phoenix."}
{"text":"The chicken soup was great, and their cookies are warm and soft! I was hangry and needed a quick bite after my flight at midnight. The host was kind of rude, and kind of belittled the fact that I wanted something to-go. And despite there being over half the place with empty tables on a Friday night it took about 15minutes before I could sit. Luckily the waitress was great!  Be wary though, you can't get anything \"to go\" here, but you can sit and ask for a to-go container. So that's what I did. Chicken soup was yummy, perfect broth, veggie, chicken ratio! And it wasn't burning hot either, so I was able to scarf it down in the comfort of the hotel room.  And chocolate chip cookie was a perfect soft, warm, chocolatey treat. Either way, I gave it 4 stars for friendly waitress and made sure I had everything I needed to get out as quickly as possible, the chicken soup was surprisingly perfect (not salty, hooray), and this place is 24hrs--great to have in the hotel! One star off for having a petty empty place on a Friday night but taking long to sit and the jerky host.  I would come back here to try their other food options!"}
{"text":"I want to try their cupcake winner - the cigarrette/tobacco one.  So I called in prior of my arrival and asked if they have it. today The lady answers yes.  I arrive there and nopes, they don't have it. So I asked the guy at the counter that I thought they have it. He gave me the same talk as last time that the schedule varies. I was a little frustrated/disappointed that the lady told me they have it but maybe she misinterpreted my question. Maybe she thought I asked if they make it and not if they have it today. So I decided since I traveled to this location, I'll try a breakfast burrito and another cupcake.  Egg and chorizo breakfast burrito: Definitely huge. Lots of egg, very fluffy and lots of cheese. Lots of chorizo in the center but not towards the edge of the burrito. The salsa is sweeter than I expected. I think there's lots of garlic flavor in either the salsa or in the burrito because I realized I still taste garlic in my mouth. I would like the salsa spicier, personally because I like spicy foods.  Tirimasu cupcake: Good but I felt like it wasn't as moist as I wanted it to be.   Parking: this time I couldn't find parking closer to the coffee shop, I ended up parking closer to Joe's Farm Grill. Busy on a Saturday morning!  Service: They work fast and quickly. The guys delivering the food remind me of California SoCal boys, they are good looking and they seem nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great coffee and the waffles and breakfast burritos are great. Super packed on the weekends so sometimes it's hard to find a spot."}
{"text":"Quaint, eclectic and busy. Busy for good reason though!  Located in Agritopia of Gilbert you're surrounded by orcharda, gardens and green space. The building is new but, built from older and restored farmland building materials. Large pained widowed walls, wood and tin. Plenty of seating covered and not.  The food is excellent prepared, especially their sweets!  I'm an iced coffee man myself, so I enjoy the up and downs of traffic while working or reading.  Attentive and pleasant staff, clean environment and the occasional farm cat outside reminds me of the ranch lands back in Michigan, and that, is hard to do."}
{"text":"I am a coffee junky! I have only had the opportunity to try a few things from this gem of a place and everything was delightful; my fave so far is their iced chi (and the fact that they serve almond milk is a big plus too)!   Beverages aside, their food is to die for! A perfect haunt for breakfast or lunch; everything is so fresh and full of flavor. Whether it's a breakfast burrito, refreshing salad or a tasty bakery treat everything is perfectly prepared and delivered to your table with a smile :)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  They have a variety of food to pick from.  You can have a hamburger to a great bowl of chicken soup. American to Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Organic, locally-grown splendor with flavorful escapades through traditional fare.  This haven, amidst tree-lined streets and hand-tended floral gardens, is a weekend oasis. I chuckle at the pets and kids who wander in with their owners. My \"next time\" for the staff is making sure to grab the right order from the kitchen before plating it in the dining area . . . but they are eager to serve.  My absolute favorite menu item is the open-faced omelette: a foundation of three fluffy eggs, strategically covered with pan potatoes, tomatoes, scallions, mushrooms, sour cream, feta and bacon. It's a mountain of morning goodness, so be prepared to walk (or roll) around the grounds afterward. I pair it with a steaming herbal tea or, on guilty pleasure day, a mocha latte.  Oh, and certainly make time for the farmers' market next door. Why not take home a little natural nosh for later?"}
{"text":"Inside TI and open 24 hours! My friend and I grabbed a late night/early morning grilled cheese with a side of fries. The sandwich was deeeeelish, although it is definitely Vegas prices. (And charges for things like ranch, which kinda sucks). But hey, when you're hungry, you're hungry, right? Service was pretty good as well! Recommend for late night yummies if you don't mind spending a bit."}
{"text":"We had no wait to get in at 10:45am on a Monday morning. Walked right up and sat down. Or server was pretty nice, too. Came back and checked on us several times.  The food was good, not the best I've ever had, but certainly not bad. I forget what they called it, but I had the 2 eggs, hash browns and toast, with the added sausage patties. My only real complaint is that the hash browns could've been a little crisper.  All around an a-okay experience.  BTW, we really love Pho but I was honestly a little scared to try it here. The smells emanating from the kitchen seemed like they had Pho, but didn't smell like good Pho, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Ample seating! Love to sit on the back patio surrounded by exotic flowers.  I love the caramel macchiato. They make their own caramel and it is divine.  Located at the Northwest corner of Ray & Higley at Agritopia, just off the 202."}
{"text":"Meh! We went at 9ish this morning. Restaurant was packed. I was surprised there was no table service, but I can survive that. My friend ordered a breakfast burrito (not sure which one). I ordered the Baby Got Jack. We each ordered a wildly overpriced coffee. My Cubano Solo was teeny-tiny, but I did fill it up with free half n half, so I felt ok about it. We ended up having to take a table on the patio and, altho we actually got a table in the shade we had to share it with about 274 flies. The food: the burrito was at least 2/3 full of potatoes. What is cheaper than potatoes? Who puts potatoes in a burrito? My sandwich was good, but greasy...not that I'm averse to greasy food, but not at that hour of the day. And it came with a green salad which was overdressed with too much vinegar.  Not impressed and won't be back. You only get one chance with this gal!"}
{"text":"This morning was my first experience with The Coffee Shop. We got there early, and it's a good thing, because it gets pretty busy around 9:00. It's very dog friendly, so I was very excited to be able to bring Frankie for breakfast with my friend. We both ordered the San Diegan open faced omelet. It comes with potatoes, sour cream, cheese, and I had them hold the bacon, the mushrooms and add spinach. Dee-lish! I ordered a white chocolate mocha, and it was much lighter than what you would get at Starbucks. We sat on the patio outside which was beautiful. Lots of tables and comfy chairs to enjoy.  This is definitely a family friendly environment. Lots of kids running around, and people having family and engagement pictures taken. Everything is green and there are lots of shade-providing trees.   It's within walking distance of the Cosmos dog park, so it makes The Coffee Shop the perfect place to stop before you spend some quality time with your dog, running through puddles and jumping through the obstacle course."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow! You know a place is good when a line is it the door.  Can't wait to go again.   Awesome Spanish latte!"}
{"text":"I do love the coffee here- and the last time I was in I had their veggie omelet and that was tasty as well. Today when I was in I decided to try their yogurt parfait, which consisted of strawberries, blueberries, granola and a citrus flavored yogurt. It was ok, wasn't a fan of the citrus flavor. They ought to give a second option if you're not a big fan of citrus. It is definitely not worth the $6.95 I paid for it. The atmosphere is always good, though they replaced a couple tables with a huge ranch one so that made finding a seat difficult unless you shared the big table. Can't wait until it cools off so you can sit outside again. Definitely a good place to go if you want good coffee and also want to support a local business. Just watch your wallet- it adds up fast."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  It's nestled between Joe's Farm Grill and the Agritopia urban farm.  Small inside--tends to fill up rather quickly during peak hours--but there is lots of great outdoor seating which you can take advantage of during the 355/356 days of beautiful weather here in Arizona ;)   Pretty much everything I've tried here is good.  Great breakfast and lunch sandwiches, drinks, and baked goods.  The fo-nuts (baked donuts) are literally to die for!  They're my fave thing here.  I'm not a fan of the cupcakes, although they are adorably cute--all decked out with glittery frosting etc.  They were a bit too dry and hard for my liking...but maybe I just went on an off day.  This is a great place to study, meet friends to chat, or just sit by yourself and read the paper or a good book.  Cool, moody music is usually playing.  Young, hipster kids work the counter.  It's nice to have a local coffee shop/bakery that doesn't scream \"corporate America.\""}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Coffee Shop for a year now.  I first heard about this place from Cupcake Wars.  After many visits, I finally stumbled upon the legendary Coffee & Cigs cupcake.  This single cupcake is the reason why I'm writing a review.  The Coffee & Cigs cupcake actually tastes like hazelnut.  It was a pleasant cupcake, a little on the denser side, with fibers of nicotine or whatnot in it.  Upon the first few bites, it was a pleasant taste but as expect, my throat started hurting.  I'm not a smoker myself but it was still quite delicious.  Give it a try!  Also, their whoopie pies are quite delicious."}
{"text":"Huge portions , good food and reasonable prices. I ordered the farmer's market skillet. It came sizzling to the table brimming with veggies , potatoes and a crack-load of cheese. Halfway through my stomach started begging me to stop."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for breakfast. I decided on a simple eggs and sausage breakfast. Nothing super special about it. I should've had a cheeseburger for breakfast.  They left the much-needed coffee pot on the table....Yay!  The server, Mary, was very friendly.  The price for the meal at The Coffee Shop was about the same as the buffet at Treasure Island, so it was the buffet the rest of the week for breakfast.  I probably wouldn't come back here in the future. There are too many other places to eat inside Treasure Island (and the rest of The Strip)."}
{"text":"Simply put, it's the best independent coffee shop in the Valley. The atmosphere, especially on the outside patio is like stepping into another part of the country. They have flowers, upon flowers, upon flowers!  It's wonderful getting to sip coffee in what feels like your own private rose garden, while falling back into comfy patio furniture. All of this while looking out onto the organic farm in Agritopia. It definitely doesn't feel like Arizona.   I absolutely love how they've decorated the place. It's 50's retro mixed with modern design, all with a bit of country charm.  The espresso drinks are excellent and their baked goods are to die for! The staff is always friendly and helpful. One thing I really enjoy is the gigantic wooden table that seats 8. It's nice to sprawl out when studying, reading the paper, or just when you have a large group with you."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  I had no idea this even existed. What rock was I living under when I lived in Phoenix for 3 years? I mean, MY GAWD! This place is super cool. From the concept and vibe to the menu and coffee.... wowza. I was so impressed with this place, I could not be happier.   Their coffee is divine.  The veggie egg scrambler I had was beyond spectacular.  And just sitting inside, chilling on a summer morning, you felt like you hadn't a care in the world. It was so inviting, with open windows overlooking Agritopia.   I was thrilled when my friend took me here. I can't rave about this place enough.   Oh, except, where was the recycle bins? That's the only thing this place is lacking."}
{"text":"Food: So So, very Carrow's or Dennys like. I tried the chicken strips and the chinese chicken salad here. Both filled my stomach but thats all. Dessert here was actually good though. I reccomend the chocolate ice box cake. You can get a peek at them when you walk by this place. I would only return for dessert. Open 24 hrs though  Price: Cheap, dessert was only around $5 or so? Other dishes are mostly under $20 for sure.  Location: In Treasure Island right near the entrance.  Service: So-so. Nothing special but better than Pho next door.  Atmosphere: Its a coffee shop! Reminded me of a Bakers Square or Carrows."}
{"text":"Loved it! Stopped in for a quick lunch and I loved every second. I was surprised to find such good eats in the Mesa/Gilbert/Chandler area, as a lot of places are chain restaurants.  I had a veggie sandwich, which was light, fresh, and tasty. I also had a black coffee and a beautiful funfetti whoopie pie. It was such a yummy treat to end the meal. It was pretty decadent, so I split it with a friend and was still satisfied.  Restaurant is open, spacey, with nice seating both inside and outside. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. It may not be the most amazing sandwich of my life, but it was very good, and I'd definitely go back, especially for more dessert. Give it a go! I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but if you stay there on the patio past closing they play the most vulgar gangster rap- I guess that's how they shoo customers away."}
{"text":"I ate here a few nights ago and the service was very disappointing . Our server was Jose and he wasn't really friendly and when we ordered our food he brought it out and then never check on us again in the 30 minutes we were there till it was time for us to get our checks. It was kinda lame because it was our first night their at T.I and his attitude made it so we weren't as pumped up. Food was whatever, not too great . I wouldn't come back here again based on the service and food. But luckily Treasure Island has a few other choices that are way better."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else has reviewedm this place serves great sandwiches, excellent coffee and positively sinful desserts. It is always busy so be prepared to wait in line.   My husband and I like to go there to grab something light but the prices and portion sizes lead us to go somewhere else if we are looking for something hearty!   Overall, nice place and a great atmosphere. One of our favorites!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Arizona & ever since we saw the creator on \"Cupcake Wars\" we wondered how it was!   I had the gingerbread latte & it was yummy! We also got a few cupcakes as well!   My favorite two was the cookie dough cupcake (very tasty!) and the cinnamon bun cupcake.. It had fun glitter on the top & it was pretty good.  Looking forward to coming back here for lunch, as I saw a chicken salad sandwich brought out to someone & it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Hostess...requested seating booth or table where my Aunt can face away from public views due to an eye injury and embarrassed by people s stares and comments. Noticed a booth and other tables where it could work...but whoever was in charge of seating this evening (May 15, 2016 9:30pm) said, \"No\" and didn't even consider of taking heart to the situation. So my Aunt is now wearing her dark glasses in the cafe, and having a hard time reading the menu, not to mention eating. A little something goes a long way. Letter to management to follow."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced, worst was the service. For some reason a waitress was giving us dirty looks and dropping food in front of us like she was doing us a favor by serving us. Absolutely terrible service."}
{"text":"The setting was nice and the coffe was great. My panini was soggy and tasted like they used old dirty fry grease on the bread. Loved the atmosphere but the food could've been a lot better!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for the first time. Great omelette! The breakfast sandwich my girlfriend had was very large.  Too much for her.  Good place to meet someone if you are in the area as well.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Great place for a \"home office\" morning. One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating. Always busy - they offer breakfast & lunch, their food is awesome! Very generous portions."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a hotel coffee shop. Pretty expansive menu and apparently the only place to get Vietnamese on the strip.  I ordered the Tuna Poke and it was actually rather impressive. The portion was huge and the tuna tasted reasonably fresh. Unfortunately the wanton chips were so greasy that I felt full before making it half way through the poke. My mom's avocado toast was also really good.  If you're not willing to leave the hotel, this is probably a better option than many of the other Treasure Island restaurants. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I love this place and come here every week. They have the best breakfast burrito, the Parker, and the best, absolute best waffles. Go ahead, tell me you know of a better waffle! I am also a big appreciator of the quality of their lattes. The latte is bold and flavorful. I ask for extra foam, and they deliver. Another reason to come here: everybody here, both servers as well as customers, are good looking. I don't know why this is. There are just a lot of good looking people here. No joke."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to meet me here and I am so glad because I never would have heard of this place or come here. I don't live in this area of the valley but it was such a cool spot, especially with the surrounding outdoor spaces for kids to explore, and Agritopia and Joe's Farm Grill to checkout.   Order your food at the counter, take a number and find a table either inside in one of two small rooms or outdoor on their patio. The indoor dining areas are smaller and don't have a ton of seating. I would imagine it gets pretty busy when the weather cools down, especially on the weekends. I can't imagine there are a ton of places like this in Gilbert and it seems like it would appeal to a younger, more hip crowd.   I tried the San Diegan and it was absolutely delicious. It was an open faced omelet with all fresh ingredients. I would definitely order it again. My friend swears by the burritos and loved hers. Coffee was pretty good but I'd have to try another to really comment on the quality because I was starving and more focused on the food. Boston cream pie was ok but I don't think I'm a huge fan of Boston cream pies in general. To be honest, I'm not even really sure why I ordered it. Next time I'm going to have to try one of their famous, award winning cupcakes! I had no idea that's what they were known for!   I'm sure this place is making Gilbert more hip and trendy. I'd return and checkout some of the surrounding spots too."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing impressive with this breakfast. The prices are high and the food is mediocre. $60 for breakfast for myself and my husband. Meh... There are way better options in Vegas... Like the Denny's across the street."}
{"text":"Great coffee, awesome staff, trendy place. Definitely recommend the cupcakes and the cookies. The outdoor area is a nice little place that you can relax with a cup of coffee over a chit chat. Joes farm grill is across the greenfield which is also pretty awesome.   try the spanish latte"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop!! Staff is friendly, ambience is great and the food is out of this world!"}
{"text":"The blonde barista this morning made half my drink and then the phone rang. She answered it, then walked away and started putting together a dozen cupcakes. She just needed to add ice and hand my drink to me! I asked cashier & she said it just needed ice but did nothing to fix it. 3 minutes later cashier added ice and handed it to me. Blonde was still clueless. Now I'm late to work. It's still a great coffee and we patronize them. Just make sure employees are attentive."}
{"text":"I love love love their coffee. Their breakfast is delicious and ingredients are super fresh. My only complain is their dine in area. It isn't very well organized and some furniture can use some updates/cleaning. I ordered a tomato basil sandwich and it was very fresh. I do wish they put a little more sauce on it because it does taste a bit blend. Other than that, it was tasty. My friends ordered other sandwiches and a waffle. They definitely clean it.    Other than that I am looking forward to come back here again."}
{"text":"Cute location and the food was great. There was a long line to order when we arrived that I assumed would go pretty quickly - it didn't. No idea why it took so long for people to place their orders, but apparently, that is a super slow process for people who live in this area. : ) However, our food came out in about five minutes which made up for it. I got the Mediterranean scramble which was delicious and came with perfectly dressed greens. My husband had the Imperial omelette and it was also delicious. The side of fruit was wonderfully sweet and service was great. A great place to have a nice, inexpensive breakfast!"}
{"text":"Bland bland bland bland bland bland...  I ordered their deal of the day of Bowtie pasta with chicken in Alfredo sauce and all I can say is that Ragu Alfredo sauce tasted better than what they served me. It's just bland and meh.  Better options to eat in Vegas, just stay away from the coffee shop."}
