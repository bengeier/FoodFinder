{"text":"Literally my FAVORITE place on campus! Their falafel is hands down the best I've ever had, all their combos are so flavorful (I've still yet to try Vienna or Barcelona but I can NOT wait to go back to do so), & the staff is AMAZING! Gave me a sample when I didn't even ask for one! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent chicken, too expensive.

This place is refreshing as an alternative to the other places on campus, but their prices are more expensive than other options around. 

I had the Barcelona platter with a side of salad, and a small drink. Although the food wasn't bad, a little on the greasy side, for $13 I expected more than 4 1.5-2 inch strips of chicken. 

If you really want chicken, go to Canes or something and get double the food for half the price. 

If you want something more on the \"healthy\" side, there are better options within walking distance of campus."}
{"text":"OMG !!! Chick-In is amazing. If you luv Mediterranean food you won't be disappointed. The Falfel is the best I've had in AZ, soft inside and crispy outside. Everything is made fresh to order...... try the TLV chicken in pita pocket. It's the best !! Great job"}
{"text":"Growing up with Middle Eastern parents, I have had every type of Mediterranean food in the game. I can honestly say that Chick In is the absolute best, most delicious and authentic shawarma that I have ever tasted, even better than the one I grew up on! I was visiting Arizona for the weekend and came back here 3 separate times just to try something new that tasted better than a home cooked meal. Also, the friendly staff makes you feel right at home! I would recommend this restaurant to every and all of my friends and am already looking forward to the next time I can go back to Arizona and eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! So nice to finally find a place in AZ that has good middle eastern food. A real pita in AZ! Not that thin paper trash served at the chains. Real Hummus and Tahini that tastes as good as the best in Tel Aviv. Israeli Salad is awesome as well."}
{"text":"We were excited and grateful for this KOSHER restaurant to be open and available to us before Pesach. The convenience of it was a big plus.  We preordered as had my hubby pick it up. They said that they run out of something ordered and replaced it with Israeli salad and hummus which was very thoughtful of them. I unfortunately couldn't try many of the items a they were all in pita with carb and gluetin, but I did have some Israeli salad which was ok. I think a little seasoning would go a long way. Maybe just salt...however, the hummus was delicious! Could have eaten the whole thing myself. I did try a bite of a falafel as it was full of flavor.  Had a wonderful texture. My hubby tried the Cancun. It want really his cup of tea,  but I thought it smelled ava looked delicious. 
My kids LOVED the Schnitzel!!! Great go to item.  The fries looked very authentic to middle eastern food.  The kids liked them. Once my mother tries her items I will update this post.  Over all I good them 4 stars as if in ever in the tempe area may stop by Judy for hummus."}
{"text":"Underwhelming and overpriced.  I had the falafel bowl; it came with 4-5 small falafel, hummus and a tiny \"salad\" consisting of chopped tomatoes and cucumber.  The texture of the falafel was good, however, they lacked flavor, as did the hummus. There was no tahini or aoli or sauce of any kind. I got the combo which came with fries (just ok) and a small cup for a drink.  All together I paid about $10 which seemed overpriced. I have not yet tried any chicken or the pitas which have pretty good reviews so I may go back to try those just because Chick-In is close by on campus. Otherwise, I would definitely go elsewhere (Haji Baba!)"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place opened but when I walked by I saw that the doors were open.  The staff greeted me in a friendly manner as I walked in. One of them offered me a freshly made falafel as I looked over the menu. I got the falafel pita since it was on the cheaper side and I had been craving falafels for a while. The pita is a nice size for it being under $6. It was filed with falafels, tomatoes, cucumber, and sauce, and it was bursting with flavor. I would have come here sooner had I known it was open. I no longer need to agonize over what to eat for lunch as I plan to come back more often.  10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Brr the rare cold and cloudy day in Tempe is here. Luckily chicken soup was the special of the day. This is not your every day canned variety soup. It was loaded full of veggies (carrots, celery, onions) chunks of white meat chicken and other seasons. Just what the flu season ordered. The seasoning worked well and the veggies make me feel like I was being healthy. I would not mind a mazto ball option to make it more filling."}
{"text":"I am in love with middle eastern food so when I saw this was on campus I was excited to try it.

I got the Tel Aviv pita and it melted in my mouth. I loved the flavor that the onions added to the shawarma. This meal brought me right back to the meals I had in Tel Aviv. I also tried a sample of the falafel and they were nice and crispy on the outside while soft and delicious on the inside.

While the price was a little more than other places around here, I can appreciate that it is certified kosher and I know I am getting great quality ingredients!

I will definitely be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"First time trying their food today at the Israeli Festival at the Odysea in Scottsdale. Mmmmmm good!!  Their --yes capital F --Falafel brought me back to great place in Jerusalem.   What was that amazing green spicy sauce?  Unbelievable.  So please move out to Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my new go to place on campus. The folks that work there are great. The food is fantastic. My favorite item is the Arizona with the aioli on the side. Fries are great too but I just get them when I'm having a craving."}
{"text":"Beat Chicken Schnitzel in town! Period. I will highly recommend the Vienna Pitta. Great taste and very inexpensive. Place is nice and clean, representatives are always with a smile. I think they can do better with their Falafel, but other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"Located on the ASU campus, Chick-In has a delicious mix of kosher and vegan Israeli street food.  Loved meeting owner Yariv Elazar, a man whose passion is food and will travel the world for a good meal.  Visit today to try items such as the Cancun Pita, the TLV Chicken, the Falafel Bowl and the Vienna Sandwich.  The sauces on the sandwiches are especially tasty, like the Chipotle Aioli on the Cancun and the Horseradish Aioli on the Vienna."}
{"text":"Foods good, although expensive. 
I always get the falafel pita, comes to around $6 & is pretty much a large snack -quite tasty.

My 3 stars results from the service.

1st occasion- taller dude standing @ register to take orders was just standing there playing on his phone. I had my wallet out, ready to order & nothing.. I had to grunt to get him to look up & engage.. hella annoying 

2nd- the shorter dude was at the register talking on the phone for 5 mins while I stood there waiting for him to acknowledge me. After his conversation was finished, he then chose to take my order 

3rd- dynamic between the cooks & the shorter dude at the register was a little uncomfortable. He seemed to be talking very rudely to the cooks as if they were stupid & could not understand him... all right in front of me, the customer. Based on this blatant belittling I've chosen not to spend my $ here any longer."}
{"text":"Quick and simple lunch!! I always ordered falafel sandwich with spicy green sauce. It is so delicious. I think they have the best falafel I ever have. It is tasty, not just bland. I also love the size of their drink. It is not large like other place but it reminds me that  I do not need a super large soda for lunch."}
{"text":"I love middle eastern food and this place does it well! My favorite lunch is the falafel or the barcelona combo. Highly recommend chick in if you want a delicious meal"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best food you'll find on Arizona State campus.

The best part is it's not just for chicken eaters... They have incredible veggie/vegan options too! Best falafel I've ever had. There's also delicious hummus pitas, french fries, and more.

I would definitely recommend giving it a try. Just a heads up: It's a little pricier than other campus options due to the fact that everything is certified kosher, fresh, and healthy."}
{"text":"New spot on campus, while the food was tasty it was completely overpriced. The menu is a little confusing and ordering became a little stressful."}
{"text":"They catered dinner here at Maxx 159....and they were very professional and the food was delicious. From the salads to their pitas ....yum. And I never really had middle eastern food but the cooks really explained everything well. Thank you.."}
{"text":"This Kosher eatery is new to ASU's campus. They pretty much only serve 2 main protein, falafel being one of them. 

I got a Falafel Pita. There's no menu description to tell you what comes in the pita. I said I wanted hummus & tahini, and requested they omit any tomatoes. 

The pita is served pocket style, which is my favorite. The falafel balls were very crisp and flavorful. I cannot say the same for the hummus, which had no outstanding qualities. I also didn't taste any tahini. There was no lettuce in my pita, which I didn't mind, but the bottom was layered with cucumbers. I do not like cucumbers, so I spent a great amount of time picking out those pieces. A simple addition of item descriptions to the menu would've saved the food and time that was wasted. 

The girl at the counter charged me $9.11 for the Falafel Pita, which the menu board states is $5.50. A man, whom I believe was the owner, confirmed that I was charged the wrong price and offered to rectify the situation. I opted for making it a combo instead (since that's what the cashier charged me for) and was quickly provided with a drink cup and a fresh order of fries.  

The fries were simple; nothing fancy in the form of seasoning, shape, etc., but they were cool. The drink size is a little on the small side, so expect to need a secondary drink to wash down your meal. I'm not sure if they allow refills. 

There are no seats or tables inside this location and they did not seem to have bags, so be prepared to carry your take out in your own two hands (or bring your own bag if you have multiple orders).

The prices were reasonable and the owners were friendly.  They are 100% kosher."}
