{"text":"Great atmosphere! Owners Frank & Alicia treat you like a guest in their home. Happy hour 7 days a week! (I almost don't want to share what a gem this place is, so I can keep it to myself.) The meatball sliders are amazing, and there's a pork chop with polenta on the Happy Hour menu for only $7!! My parents are regulars here now, and I can see why. If I lived closer I would be too!   All in all, a great place for homemade Italian dishes (and desserts) that is perfect for the area!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service. First time to dine here, and we are very excited because of the high star ratings, but we are wrong. We felt unwanted and rushed. Our server made us feel that we are not welcome. When you go to this type of restaurant and spent $17-20 per entr√©e you expect to have a relaxing, not rushed dinner. The other servers were serving complimentary bread and checking their tables, we only saw our server 3 times; 1) took our order 2) serve food 3)give our bill. No bread, no water refill, no checking if we are still alive...nothing! So disappointing and disheartening, food is alright but nothing special. I think we would have a better experience if not for that particular server. Such a waste of money and time. Will I come back and give it a second chance, maybe, as long as we get treated well, but not for a while for sure. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"The mistake I wont make again, should have learned from our last visit. Friends told us the food and service was improved, so went to celebrate Valentines Day..Big mistake. Our waiter was a disaster he told us there were items in the dishes we ordered that did not appear when our meals arrived. I'm not a veal eater, but was assured by the waiter it was wonderful, it was shoe leather.We could not order any after dinner coffee, they had none, who ever heard of an Italian restaurant without coffee.We split the bill with our friends because we drink wine with dinner they don't.When the bill came it was creative my bill had items my friends ate and they had items we ate, they also got my wine bill. It all worked out in the end. it was kinda funny."}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti and meatball lunch special,  friend had the meatball sub, both were delicious!  Service was fast and efficient. Great place to spend your lunch break."}
{"text":"He who must eat and I have been to Pacino's twice and we are looking forward to the next time! The service is great, food is tasty with enough variety without having a cumbersome menu. Service  at the bar is friendly the Social Hour hummmms with happy patrons. The Live Entertainment on weekend is a real bonus.  The owner is there taking care of business and it shows.So glad they have chosen to be in the neighborhood and looking forward to enjoying many more tasty treats."}
{"text":"We held our daughters ASU graduation party here. They allowed us to bring in our own decorations. Frankie put together a fantastic menu that all our guests raved about and promised to return with their friends and family.  The service was top notch Zane & Jen made sure our guests had drinks and food through the entire event.  The fire table and fireplace on the patio only added to the evening ambiance. I would highly recommend Pacinos for special events."}
{"text":"The food was nothing short of phenomenal. The staff is nice, along with a great atmosphere and possibly the best happy hour menu around (3pm-close)."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss. I've been there four times now and the food is either great or lacking in every way possible from the portion size, to over salting the food. I am beginning to think of other Italian options as the bang for the buck just does not add up."}
{"text":"WOW - bad.  Party of 4, ordered salads and entrees.  Two salads arrive and are consumed before other 2 salads are delivered.  House salad bitter and just a mound of lettuce - not a tomato or crouton in sight.  Hot entrees arrive much later. Two are cold and the chicken one has obviously been heated up from frozen as is part frozen in center.  Appears no food is house made - all heated from pre-packaged.  If you want to pay $20 for package ravioli have at it.  Also the wine by the glass is awful."}
{"text":"We have been in the past and really loved it but this last time was sadly our last time. The food was lackluster and lukewarm. The service was not customer oriented   I don't know what went wrong but our experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Pacino's five times, both in the restaurant and take-out. The food is excellent. The staff is very nice and attentive, including taking take-out orders over the phone. We're really pleased to have a new high quality family-run local restaurant nearby. If you live in the Alta Mesa-Red Mountain-Las Sendas area we recommend them, including take-out."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at the rave reviews on here! I hope the restaurant reads this and takes what I have to say into consideration. There's a few things that they could change so my family and I would come back. I'm going to break it down so you can read about which part matters most to you.   1. The Atmosphere: The restaurant has a pretty cool atmosphere. It's modern and has some nice decor that fits the theme and name of restaurant well. There is low lighting, which I like, but it made it more than obvious every time the front door opened. Think about how annoying it is when you're at the movies in the middle of the day and someone uses a side exit. You can't help but notice. There are surrounding restaurants with even nicer decor and lower or comparable prices.   2. The Service: Our waitress was great. We were greeted right when we walked in and given the option of a table or booth. We chose the booth. The backs are straight up, which forces you to have good posture. Our waitress was very attentive, but at first I felt a little rushed to make a choice of which food I would order. I don't think she meant for it to come off that way though. Once she asked if it was our first time here she pulled up a chair and gave us a quick run down on her favorites. Our table was only set for two so we had to ask for additional silverware for the other two people. Not the waitresses fault, but something the hostess should have caught when seating us. The owner came around to our table and asked us if everything was good. We all nodded and smiled. I felt the urge to tell him how I really felt, but you can never tell if people will take criticism well. So, I just figured I was going to Yelp about it and they can read it there and decided what they want to do.   3. The Food and Options: OK, here's where we go down hill really fast. First thing I must say is nothing was terrible. Otherwise, I would've only given one star. When we got to our table there was a bottle of red wine that they had on special for the day. $15 for a whole bottle of wine. We were not able to taste it because they had no bottles of it open yet. Well, if you tell that to everyone who wants to taste it, then you will never have a bottle open. I understand cutting costs where possible, but with the prices this restaurant charges, they should offer a taste if they want us to consider paying $15.00 for what is probably a $7 bottle of wine. I started looking around for a drink menu and to my surprise there was not one. It wasn't just missing from our table either. I asked the waitress for a drink menu and her response what that \"We don't have one, but we have a full bar and can make pretty much whatever you want.\" So, I said (not in a rude tone, by the way), \" So, I have to think up a drink or use Google to figure out what I want?\" . I think I caught her off guard with my response and I can't remember if she responded because I was a little annoyed and just took out my phone to start googling drinks. In the meantime, my Mom had asked quite a few questions about the food on the menu. Their meat is all pre-mixed and it's 3 different meats mixed together. It sounded gross to me. The waitress left and came back again to see if we were ready to order. I was still googling away trying to find a drink . This time she asked me what kind of drink I usually like. I told her I normally like a cranberry juice with vodka and lime, but I was hoping to try something different. She suggested their Sangria that is \"made in house and unlike any other sangria\". That intrigued me so I ordered it. We then ordered food and I got some kind of Gnocchi Pasta in a white sauce. My Mom got a pasta with the word Funghi in it. My sister ordered Ravioli. A house salad was included with each meal. I asked if they have ranch dressing and to my surprise, not they do not. I was given the option to upgrade to a Caesar salad for an additional $2.00. Their house salad comes with a white wine vinaigrette dressing and seems to be a mesclun salad. I was delighted to find that I did like the dressing, but the salad was seriously lacking vegetables.  My meal was pretty good. The sauce was good. The fact that it was $15 and there was no meat in it is what baffles me. My sister was pretty disappointed with the amount of raviolis that she got. Normally she can share a meal with her daughter and they're both full, but they finished their plate and they were both hungry. I ended up sharing my Gnocchi with them. Apparently my family loves bread because we went through 4 different rounds of bread. It had a balsamic vinaigrette dipping sauce which I liked and the bread was pretty good. I had two and a half slices of the bread which is equivalent to about one and half Olive Garden Breadsticks , so you can compare size. The sangria that I had previously ordered was decent. There was nothing about it that seemed to make it special. Tiramisu was pretty good. I'm out of room to write. It's cutting me off. LOL"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here yesterday. The waitress was good, she forewarned us that she usually works nights and this was her first time on days. That being said, to the meal. I wanted the Veal piccata, but did not want the vegetable so I asked if I could substitute some macaroni as the side. She checked at the counter and said that would be fine - no up charge was mentioned.  The dish arrived with two rather small pieces of Veal and a small dollop of spaghetti as they don't have Angel hair. The Veal was on the tough side, but the piccata sauce was wonderful.  My wife ordered the Chicken Parmesan which was good. The sauce could have been a little Spicer, but that's personal taste. It came also with a brief dollop of spaghetti with Marinara sauce.   Overall the meal was acceptable.   BUT... then came the bill. The Veal  Piccata was billed at $17.00 not $14.00 as the menu listed it. We called the waitress over and questioned the charge. She stated that was the up charge for the spaghetti. We further asked why we weren't told at the time we ordered? She said \"oh that was my fault!\" And that was that.   We might have gone back, but not after that."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Pork chop Marsala and a side of polenta for $7 and draft brews for $3.50 for crafts and this is all day!!! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to get a slice of pizza, I had the pepperoni and my girlfriend had a cheese (both slices) my friend had the boneless BBQ wings. The pizza was decent and thin good taste too much grease. The wings were bland a little flavorless almost as of they just poured mcdonalds sauce on battered chicken nuggets...... Overall three stars"}
{"text":"After living in the area for many years, we finally tried this place. What a great find. First time was Valentine's Day and we only had the option to order the 4 course meal for two. It was great! So we looked at the rest of the menu and realized the Sunday happy hour was a great deal. $6 pizza was awesome and it is not skimpy. A full 10 inch. Fried calamari yum! My husband ordered mussels for $6 too. Wow, great taste and cheap for what you get. Quiet Sunday at 4 with peaceful music and the doors open. It's our new hangout I think. Trust me. We are foodies and this is every bit as good as RWB across the street and Got Sushi. So if you want equivalent food as those, try this place for a change. Glad we gave it a shot."}
{"text":"Our wedding reception was held at Pacino's. It was a last minute decision and Frank (owner/manager) was very accommodating.  It exceeded our expectations.  He had many great ideas in prepping for our 31 guests.  The food was fabulous.  The service was impeccable.  A good time was had by all!"}
{"text":"Tried it. Not interested in trying it again. Better spots nearby, red white & brew is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Saturday June 8, Celebrated our son Steve's birthday with a family dinner at Pacino's in Mesa.The food was awesome the service from our waiter Mike was great with loads of fun added. Frank and Alicia are the perfect host and hostess, greeting us at our table. I highly recommend Pacino's, as a 1st generation Italian raised on great Italian food.  Buon appetito e Mile Grazie"}
{"text":"On Valentine's day, they offer only a four course set menu. It was great. But under these conditions, I will need to update my review based on the normal menu. What did we have? Marscapone Bruschetta; Salad with gorgonzola, raisins and pine nuts; Hanger Steak, Salmon, and Airline Chicken Breast. For dessert we all shared a mixed selection: Mini Cannoli's, and Salted Carmel Cheesecake.  In technical terms, I would sum-up the meal as follows: Yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in N. Scottsdale. We came down here to meet friends who were in from Canada. The service was excellent. We loved our servers BUT when my chicken came out, it was about 75% raw. I kindly sent it back but asked for a different dish. This took another 20 minutes and everyone else was finished eating.  My only complaint was that no one, not even the manager, who helped our server tally up our bill (we witnessed this), never offered to take anything off the bill. Offer a glass of wine, take the replacement pizza off the bill. SOMETHING. We believe if there is a big mistake, comp something. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Never eaten here, but it looks better than Il Forno. As a matter of fact, the restrooms probably look better than Il Forno. If you want Italian food go to Pacinos and forget Il Forno--who put the 'ill!' in Italian!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian food, ambiance and a great selection wine. Friday and Saturday evenings live music kicks in around 6p'sh; nice compliment to the evening. Have to mention the great patio with fire-pit ambience as well."}
{"text":"Great food all homemade when you order, at least that's what it tasted like!  The bread that comes with dinner is wonderful.  The wait staff were awesome, very attentive but not hovering. The only complaint I have is I think they should include a salad with your meal.  We had one calamari appetizer, 2  pasta dinners, 2 glasses of house wine and the bill was $75.. A little over priced for the amount of food you get. I don't like eating in a restaurant where the overhead lighting is too bright, and it is here.  Just one of my quirks.."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. The fresh grilled salmon was perfectly prepared. A bottle of Malbec paired very nicely with the salmon and a lemon mascarpone cake for dessert.  They have launched a new menu, We look forward to trying some of the new items."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was top notch. Perfect day for an afternoon lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"Very surprising restaurant. Been looking for a good, non-chain italian restaurant since moving to this area and finally found it!  Service is fine and food is very tasty, seasoned well with fresh ingredients. The tiramisu is wonderful!!  Love a place that's generous with garlic and spice. Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"We went looking for great Italian food on the Eastside and this is definitely \"Little Italy\" what an amazing menu!  The Seafood was a real treat as well.  We were impressed with the d√©cor and it felt very upscale as well.  Thank you for bringing quality to the suburbs!  The Service was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Awesome location and I like the bar but that's about it. The service borders on atrocity. We went for the special \"wine tasting dinner experience\" but when we walked in, there were two long tables pushed together to accommodate about 24 people and there were 4 people sitting there in their sixties. So we decided to forego that \"experience\" and just head to the bar until the rest of our party was ready to sit down for dinner. The bartender was nice but a bit socially awkward it seemed. We got our drinks, socialized for 20 minutes then elected to grab our table. Moving 5 feet from the bar to our table was the least painful experience of the evening. We ordered our individual meals and all wanted the Caesar salads to start. They brought house salads (not a big deal to me, but my my GF's mom really wanted Caesar so she understandably asked to have them sent back). So the server brings the \"Caesar\" salads and they consisted of a pile of lettuce, a little dressing, and I think some pulled the 'loosen the pepper-shaker cap' trick on the chef....4 times. So, once again we sent them back and just conceded that we'd get a half decent salad so we gave up on them. The waitress apologized again and offered  the excuse that \"um, so our salad guy went, like, somewhere and another guy that doesn't do salads did them. So, sorry about that guys.\" Restaurant's have salad-guys? ***....I'm getting hand-cramps from writing this on my phone so I'm just going to skip to the end. My girlfriend ordered the ravioli and it literally was a plate with 5 ravioli on it. It was $16. Lastly, our cheesecake was seriously some sort of Costco packed puck of cheesecake slapped on a plate with a caramel sauce squirted across it. $7 including the little wax-paper coaster that it sits on while in the freezer. So yeah, 2 stars for at least having cold beer and a decent bar. Sorry, but it's not enough to get me back there though."}
{"text":"Food ok at best. Pizza was not very good, bread tasted stale,Very small portions high prices. We will not be back this was our second time there we figured we would try it one more time and nothing has changed Italian food should not be that expensive. And should not still feel hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant. The service is great and the ambiance is exceptional. Can't say either about the food which is bland and unmemorable. Have tried it at least 4 times over the past 2 years and my experience has been the same. Too bad."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  My wife and kids took me to Pacino's for my birthday.  They told the hostess making the reservation that it was for my birthday - nothing was said upon seating, during the meal or after dinner.  My chicken parm was flavorless (they said it was their best seller), my wife's Bolognese was watery and my daughter's pasta tasted anything but fresh.  Thankfully, our little guy had decent chicken fingers (frozen of course).  It took nearly an hour for our food to come up!  I am really not sure how anyone can say that they had a good experience after the lousy night we had here.  I guess it's possible to have an off night, but how does it happen in every aspect of the experience?  Oh well - we will NOT go back for another shot....there aren't many Italian restaurants worth a damn in the greater Phoenix area, but this place is not worth wasting your money on."}
{"text":"Our evening was perfect. We loved the Calamari right from the start, our entrees were delicious and we finished with the fabulous dessert.  The restaurant is themed after Al Pacino, so look forward to going back in time with the appropriately outfitted staff to the music, the beautiful paintings and hospitality.  The hostess, the entertainment, waitstaff, appetizers, entrees, dessert, Frank & Alicia, we couldn't have asked for a nicer evening. Looking so forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch here. There is a good lunch menu but they had removed the lasagna from it. Instead two of us split the dinner sized. It was ample food for the two of us and decent lasagna. Another ordered spaghetti with meatballs and it was a very large portion for a lunch sized item. The fourth had a salad and it was disappointing--way too much vinegar in the dressing. I had the same dressing on my house salad and agreed it was not a very good salad (nor even good Balsamic vinegar).   The place was surprisingly empty for the noon hour. The server was OK; the manager was also on the floor but made no attempt to see how we were doing or even make eye contact with us going in and out the door.  If it had been busy I could see that, but given there were only a few tables he could have made an effort to be a bit more professional given the stature of the restaurant and catering business."}
{"text":"Welcome to the east valley!!  So glad to have a real Italian restaurant nearby - it's about time.  Visited Pacino's for lunch today with my son.  My son ordered the pasta in vodka sauce with prosciutto and peas and I ordered the lunch special Stromboli.  Both dishes were recommended by our server (and owner we later found out) and she was so right.  The pasta dish had plenty of delicious creamy sauce with plenty of crispy chunks of prosciutto.  The stromboli can only be described as layers of flaky pizza dough stuffed with pepperoni and homemade sausage filling topped off with cheese garlicky goodness.  The stromboli was served with a nice bowl of red sauce for your dipping pleasure.  Both dishes were large portions, not the standard lunch size, and could have easily been shared by two along with a side salad.  Didn't have room for dessert but can't wait to come back for dinner and try more.  The owners Frank and Alicia were so friendly and the service was excellent.  Thanks again for a delicious lunch and introducing Mesa to real Italian food."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law took my husband and myself here for his late birthday dinner. My husband says we are definitely going back.  He raved about it the whole time. As you can tell from previous reviews, he's not always a rave every restaurant kind of guy.  The portions are, as expected, Italian kitchen big. The food was delicious.  The ambiance was nice, yet casual.   Overall: Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I live in central phx.....this place can't compare to the pizza joints in that area, but for the suburbs i was impressed but still couldn't get passed 3 stars. The pizza was average and the vibe was a typical suburb vibe. The server was fantastic and very friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted pasta for dinner.  My boyfriend suggested Pacino's based on his mom going there and liking it.  They had music tonight - was ok.  A little loud for my taste.  We ordered calamari and eggplant involtini to start.  For some reason our salads came out before our appetizers -which was fine because we were hungry anyway.  But I noticed while we were eating our salads the appetizers were done and on its way to our table....but then the gentleman (I assume the manager or owner) took the apps back and put them under the heat lamp.   We finished our salads and our apps were brought to us -about 5 mins or so later.  Now the calamari was cold and some that were overcooked were now rubbery.  The eggplant involtini held its heat and was really good.  Halfway through the apps I noticed our main course was done, but again because we were still eating our apps, they sat under the heat lamp.  When we were done and our server came over, I told her to please bring our entree's over so they didn't continue to get cold.  My boyfriend got the Tour of Italy, it looked good. But he said it was just ok.  The chicken parm was somewhat dry and over seasoned, lasagna was just ok and fettuccine well....it's fettuccine.  I ordered the spaghetti and mama's meatballs. Had good flavor, meatball was a little dry but seasoned well.  Overall our experience was just ok...wasn't that impressed.  We weren't even offered dessert or asked how things were when our bill was dropped off.  Pretty much the best thing we had was the eggplant involtini.  Pretty sure we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't recommend this restaurant!  Napkins smelled!  Water glasses were dirty. Mine had something sticky on it.  The wall alongside me had stuff splashed and dried on the wall that wasn't cleaned up. The supposed Pacino's Amber ale was served in a ghetto Bud Light glass. My wife had a beer salad I could have thrown together better.  Service was good, but all in all, don't waste your money here.  D-vine or red-white-brew is much better."}
{"text":"Tonight was an amazing night. We decided at the last minute to stop and have a glass of wine and an ice cold beer at Pacino's. We are so glad we did. From the minute we walked in we were welcomed and taken care of. The house wine was great, beer was cold. But the best part of the evening was how welcomed we were by the hostess Brenna! She showed us to our table, gave us great suggestions on the menu and made us feel right at home. Our server Shannon also took very good care of us! All in all a great night. Again a big thank you to Brenna for going above and beyond. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere+great wine+delicious food.  Recommend reservations, going to be hard to get a table once word gets around."}
{"text":"This location seems to be a jinx after years of f failed restaurants and hope the Pacino's would break the curse!  The food is pretty good I've been there several times, the service is awkward at best!  There's some guy that's been there every time I visited that appears to be the owner or manager, He's a real creepster and always makes my dates feel uncomfortable. Really sad I would like to see a great restaurant show up in that location"}
{"text":"great place to go and have  cocktails and wine, but as a restaurant in this building that has failed in the past the owners are not very outgoing to new guests, have gone to this establishment 8-9 times in the past 2 months and not once have either of the owners acknowledged us by saying hi or how are how are you when walking by. they seem to greet patrons they know .  but as someone that is in the hospitality industry, I would want to make every guest that steps into my establishment feel special by greeting them with a hello or shaking hands making sure I appreciate their business getting to know them. The bartender/manager in charge when Alicia and Frank are off is more accommodating and welcoming than they are. One of the reasons I would return. not the owners"}
{"text":"We hosted our wedding rehearsal dinner here. We can't say enough great things about the food, service, and how the evening turned out.  They were easy to work with arranging the menu ahead of time, the food was perfect! We had bruschetta, salad, pasta, salmon, and dessert. Our server always kept the food coming and drinks filled.  The patio was perfect on a early November night. They even allowed us to rent lines to dress up the table. I would highly recommend this places for a large event or casual dinner."}
{"text":"We've been here 2-3 times and only repeated hoping the previous bad experience was a fluke. No more. Poor service, cold food that should have been hot, slightly wrong orders, and the list could go on. The owner typically is just sitting at the bar looking dejected and the live music they have is subpar and loud. No more tries."}
{"text":"Thanks again to Amanda, Angela Amy amd Mia for outstanding Friday night service, we asked for a reservation for 20, and brought 38, they still delivered on exceptional service and excellent food!  Thank you Frank!"}
{"text":"WOW!  What a find.  The food is delicious and the service is superb.  Meatball sliders, pizza, and bruschetta were all delicious, and NOT over priced. Try the canoli. It's absolutely divine.  They have a great \"Happy Hour\" menu."}
{"text":"First time to Pacino's. Recently moved to the area and looking for neighborhood restaurant with charm, patio and of course good food. Chose Pacino's to try. Not disappointed! Staff was exceptional from wine choosing to food suggestions. Patio was perfect, soft music and sunset. Definitely will be back. Great time of year because you can get a table and enjoy Az!  Thank you Pacino's."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Pacino's for 2 years.  We can always count on this restaurant for great food and great service.  The owner and staff are great to work with.  They always make us feel special.   I highly recommend Pacino's.  You will love the great food and great service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for New Years Eve. What a disaster! For starters, the waitress spilled approximately a glass of wine on the table from our $100 bottle. Got up to use the restroom where paper towels are left just sitting on the counter instead of putting them in the dispenser and the handicap stall toilet doesn't flush (leaving someones fecal matter for all to enjoy). My husband ordered pork medallions and I the lobster ravioli. The pork was served rare...WHAT???? My meal was served room temperature. The owner came over after we sent the pork back sporting a sweat shirt and baseball cap. He stated that \"this is the way they serve it otherwise it will be tough\". Again, WHAT??? I guess the restaurant owner has never heard of food born illness. Stay clear of this restaurant for heavens sake."}
{"text":"Although I was put off by the open space concept and cement floors once the food arrived my mind was changed. The calamari was outstanding , more than enough for two to share. My wife had the Taste of Italy enjoyed it very much. I had the pork osso buco portion was very large and excellent. And best of all my Martini was perfect."}
{"text":"Love happy hour all day every day! Love it out on the patio and salmon salad is delish. Great value! Neighborhood friendliness. Great service today."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, wonderful atmosphere, excellent service and incredible weekday lunch menu...one of my fave places for sure! Close to my house but definitely worth driving to."}
{"text":"I met a group for lunch here just today!  I didn't have much time to look over the menu so I ordered what a few other guest at our table  ordered.  I had the most amazing salad with mixed greens, black and green greek olives, red onion, tomato, cucumbers topped with a large piece of grilled salmon. The seasoning on the salmon was the absolutely delicious and the price was just right at $9.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  The pasta dishes looked so yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on Saturday.  The food is very good (yeah ). The space has great ambiance.  Staff were smartly outfitted.  Open kitchen. There was entertainment -a great Jazz player. It was the  right volume to allow for conversation .   Only drawback was the service. It was rushed.   They presented the meal while the appetizer was only half done, asked about dessert while we were still eating the main course and presented the bill while we were still eating.  The food is worth a return trip. Hopefully the wait staff  will learn how to pace the meal service so that the food can be enjoyed to its fullest.  Then I can give it a fourth star!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Pacino's. Went on a Friday evening. Was seated immediately. There was a nice jazz duo playing. Our waitress was warm, and attentive. We planned on a dinner and appetizer. But the warm bread (my hubby indulged) the breaded zucchini was so large and delicious we ended up splitting a pizza. We had a GF with fig balsamic, artichokes and other delicious veggies. The crust was amazing. I had a delicious Pino Grigio recommended by our waitress. She gave a good pour and we tipped her well for a great meal and service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I sat here and read some of the reviews, wondering what restaurant they were talking about...because no way were they talking about the restaurant that I went to and the restaurant where I held a birthday party for my mom.   Frank was wonderful from the first call right through the event, extremely responsive, accommodating and an all around good guy.    I read that the food had no taste...these people must be used to over salted food from your local chain restaurant, none of that here.  The food was fabulous!! We are still hearing from people how great at food was...  The salad was a real salad, not iceberg lettuce but real greens with a delicious white balsamic dressing. Eggplant Parmesan was so delicious that even people who swore they didn't like eggplant ate it and raved about it. Vegetable lasagna had fresh veggies, and there was no skimping on those. Penne ala Vodka... all I can say about that is YUMMY!! Chicken Piccata ... Delicious, flavorful and the chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork. We had small pizzas for the kids and the adults all wanted a piece it was that good!  I highly recommend Pacino's and can't wait to go back.  If you want real Italian food  come here otherwise go to the places that they call \"Italian\" restaurants run by a large corporation that is over-salted, over-garlicky and disgusting.  This is the real deal...mangia bene!"}
{"text":"Relatively new to the area, my daughter and I had driven by Pacino's many times and thought we'd give it a try. We were seated rather quickly, and the hostess took our drink orders. Eventually another waitress came to our table apologizing profusely saying she had just arrived to work and she was sorry we had to wait. Our order was taken but I waited a long time to get my salad. I specifically asked for no onions and no cucumbers however the waitress was already at our table when she noticed that they were onions and cucumbers on the salad, so I had to wait for her to return the salad to the kitchen. While waiting for our food I noticed that they were miscellaneous items in corners behind booths, etc.  This definitely ruined the ambience.   I ordered eggplant parmigiana. The portion was huge and LUKEWARM at best. The shredded mozzarella cheese did not even melt. The plate was cold, my daughter told me that the warming lamps were not lit (my back was to the kitchen), when I complained to our waitress she informed me that the heat lamps were broken. The \"eggplant\" was apparently stuffed with mozzarella, I literally could not see the eggplant. I was so disgusted that I just had her bring me a take out box. The waitress again apologized profusely and took 20% off our bill.   My suggestion:  shut down the restaurant for a thorough cleaning, redecorate and hire chefs that know how to cook. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was bland and not fresh at all. Chicken parm was absolutely hideous, no flavor, breading was old, stale and soggy. I have never had chicken parm served with meat sauce that tasted like it was made from a ketchup base. I don't think Al Pachino would approve of this food. Some of the worst Italian food in the East Valley! Also extremely overpriced."}
{"text":"Pacino's is a good neighborhood place. The food is always good. The wedge salad is one of our favorites. Service is sometimes a little lacking."}
{"text":"My mother had a ladies lunch here, and recommended it. We decided to give it a try for dinner. We started with the Eggplant Rollatini, and even my 5 year old child tried it. It was super good, and tells me that next trip I'll be trying an eggplant dinner. I tried the Alfredo pasta, with the special Gorgonzola Alfredo sauce. My daughter loved the kids spaghetti. =) The best recommendation was the Lemonchello cake - had a real lemon taste. Yum."}
{"text":"We went last Saturday night and it was awesome. Place was packed, live music, food was great. Bartender was sssslllllooooww, but we let it slide, we realize they are working out the kinks, we get it.  Decided to give it another whirl tonight, as it was getting late and we wanted to stay local. My husband and I arrive at 9pm for reverse happy hour. They have a simple but great and reasonably priced happy hour menu. Caesar salad $5 truffle fries $3, artichoke dip  with crostini bread $4, marguerita pizza $6, salmon salad on a bed of greens ( really good) and a burger, ( didn't love) . Anyway, this place has awesome owners and the wherewithal to succeed, however, Leon, the \" bartender\" is gonna take em down if they keep him behind the bar.  He seems super sweet and genuine, but the worst bartender on the planet, it's almost comical. Also, after 9pm, dim the lights a little and invest in a sound system. I felt like I was sitting in my house at my kitchen counter. Its all about Ambience ambience ambience!  Also, the eggplant parm $14 was delicious and my husband ordered the meatball sliders both times we've been. That means he likes them a lot.   I am excited to have a local place that caters to the hip 40's crowd who don't always wanna go to Scottsdale when we want a nice upscale dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday. Was blown away by the home cooking and choices. Lemon ricotta pancakes, bruschetta, bacon, fruit with home made whip cream, egg dishes, and other brunch type items. Really great you much check this out. It is also not pretensions. Great drink specials ($5) and brunch is about $15 per person. Mom and pop type place where you can tell the owner is behind ever recipe and in the kitchen.  Will be back and bring friends!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now.  I've never been disappointed. The food is fantastic every time.  For the money, you can't beat their happy hour. $6 pizza, $6 burger, $6 salmon. Great food and affordable in Mesa that's not a chain place!  Sign me up!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went in hoping for great Italian food. Had friends  recommend it.  Service was good. Friendly and attentive, restaurant was clean and well appointed for its size.  The food we found lacking flavor.  We found the pastas sauces very bland. I had the Pomodoro and hubby had the Linguini Pescatore and we found both to be lacking seasoning or flavor.  Overall we walked out feeling let down based on the reviews."}
{"text":"After being seated we didn't see a server til we got up to leave and that was at least 20 minutes after we sat down. Patient hubby but I would have left after 5.  Food mediocre at best.  Owner said so sorry as we left but no other admission of terrible service. Stay away."}
{"text":"Awful food, meatballs we're still slightly cold and frozen. Brought 2 other people with me and we all got sick. Will never return!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food and many GLUTEN FREE options!  I waited to write this reviews to have the opportunity to have visited Pacino's multiple times and have tried many of their entree's. Their salad dressings are homemade and most are gluten free.  The salads are outstanding.  Our favorite is the mixed greens with goat cheese, strawberries and grilled chicken with a white balsamic vinaigrette.  The chicken is always grilled perfectly and incredibly tender.  The pear and gorgonzola with arugula and pecans is another winner.  you really can't go wrong with any of their salads.  The  sauces for the pasta are made from scratch and the flavor and quality are way above average.  Some restaurants when you order an alfredo sauce you feel as though your eating a somewhat flavorless lump of flour.  Not the case at Pacino's. Not pasty at all.  They even have a pesty alfredo sauce. They have lobster raviolis, portobello mushroom raviolis, both not only have an amazing flavor, but a beautiful presentation. The  three meat lasagna,  tortellaci Di Carne (beef stuffed pasta) with a brandy cream sauce, and chicken marsala are also not to be missed. We have tried many of their dishes and they do not disappoint.  Since I have to eat gluten free I really appreciate that so much of their menu can accommodate gluten free.  They also have a very good gluten free pizza.  They don't really have any gluten free desserts, but if you don't need gluten free their desserts are excellent!  We have tried the chocolate cake, the lemon cake, and cannoli.  All are full of flavor and delicious!  We will definitely return to this restaurant and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The only reason I started  going there though was because of Robin of Robco entertainment.. Robin hosts karaoke and it was awesome!  I found it abhorrent the way that the owner treated Robin.. He lead her on saying that it was a permanent gig and then last night, the owner left and then texted the bartender to tell Robin that it was her last night.  Robin had over 25 singers last night!  I will not return."}
{"text":"So shocked this place has an average 4 star rating. Real simple the food was bad and the waitress made us feel like we we're annoying her. Maybe the cook was off and she doesn't work there anymore....."}
{"text":"My husband and I made our way over here after our original choice of Red, White & Brew was insanely busy. I looked up the reviews quickly before we got there and figured we would give it a try. Let's just say the reviewers must be overly generous or just like okay food. We were sat right away as there were only a few other tables sat, the bar area was full though. We got out bread which was just ok, came with a little side of olives. My husband always sticks with pretty basic stuff so he ordered the lasagna and I tried the spicy marinara pasta with shrimp. The salad that came with our meals was basically just some greens with onions and a few tomato slices but the white vinaigrette dressing made up for the lack of veggies in it. My husband said his lasagna was good but just very very rich and very very cheesy. My pasta was pretty good but the sauce was really watery and not as flavorful as I had expected. The shrimp were grilled and did have quite a good flavor to them. The decor there is lacking and they need something to make it seem more warm and inviting, feels a bit sterile. Our waitress was wonderful and stayed on top of us and was very friendly. Overall, the food was average and our wine was just ok. Basically for two meals and two glasses of wine, I wouldn't spend $55 plus tip there again. I wanted to like it more but it was just missing something for me."}
{"text":"We love Pacino's! Frank helped us host our event to help raise money for the Mesa High School's 30th Reunion! Everyone loved the food and we had a great time! We go back time and time again for dinner or just to listen to music and relax! A great local place! :-)"}
{"text":"Cool Place! Great food with great service. I loved how the owner Frankie is hands on and really good with the regulars. Zane behind the bar is a true Gem. I found them on Facebook and love the fun posting that they put up. Have been back many time and will continue to return. Our Favorite Place!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had an impromptu date for dinner and ordered a nice wine and the Tortellini with veal, pork, beef and covered with prosciutto in a white sauce ala Alfredo with side of their special meatballs. Brian, our waiter was superb and patio dining was comfortable but the food is delicious! Been here for lunch, dinners and found service, quality and taste consistently fabulous!!"}
{"text":"A new favorite!   We went in for lunch today for the first time with another couple.   I ordered the Devil's Avocado pizza which was amazing!  It had artichokes, olives, tomatoes, and beautifully displayed avocado.  It looked like there were not enough artichokes on it, so I asked the waiter for more artichokes (before I even tasted it which was dumb).  He accidentally brought me extra avocado.  :-)  But it was actually perfect as is.  I ate the avocado anyway because extra good cholesterol is always a bonus.  Next time I will eat it exactly as made because it was PERFECTION!  Too bad I did not take a pic.  :-)  The tiramisu was very good, and I took a piece to go for my daughter to sample too.  It was definitely delicious, but I am not sure if it was light or \"airy\" enough for me.  Not sure, but it was a little different than what I usually like.  However, the flavor was perfect.  I like a fluffy, mousse like texture.  It was very light, but I am not sure....  Still good and would order it again.    My husband ordered the chicken parmigiana.  He thought it was delicious, and he could not even eat half do to the humungous portion.  I only managed to eat two of the 6 slices of my pizza, so we have left overs for our teenage kids which will be gone soon.    Service was wonderful.  Our waiter, Jimmy?,  was great!  It looks like we have found a new Italian place.  I am definitely going back for the best pizza ever, Devil's Avocado.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"First time there. Food was really good. We got the lobster ravioli and the Gorgonzola steak. Both were good. I would highly recommend the lobster ravioli. Stuffed with real lobster. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Pacino's but did not want to deal with a bust Friday night so I decided to order online. The online ordering process was the start of this bad experience. I got an email notification 20 mins after my order was placed saying it would be 30 -45 mins.  I headed in around the requested time and picked up my food and went home.. My order was 60.00 we got the spinach dip, taste of Italy, the risotto and the kids spaghetti. All of it was completely underwhelming. The meatball tasted like dog food. The risotto was overcooked and lacked flavor and the taste of Italy was just bland and did not have nearly enough sauce with the fettuccini. The bread that came with the spinach dip was stale. I would have expected more and would take Olive Garden over this place any day. I will not be back! Side Note** the photos is of the food an hour after I got home clearly it was not consumed!!"}
{"text":"Go with 4 1/2 stars out of 5. Been there twice. Food's been great, portions large, service good, prices fair. We've tried the butternut squash ravioli, mushroom ravioli, gnocchi, mussels, lasagna, and bruschetta. Looking forward to going through the menu. Surprised it hasn't been crowded. Parking is ok, not a lot, but we've been lucky. Service is a little slow at times, but always friendly and knowledgable. Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"I thought the place was classy, food: outstanding! The waitress behind bar was nice and attentive as I ate at the bar. The staff was very nice and I like it way better than Red White and Brew because the ambiance and food is better. I will go back and am telling all of my friends to eat there!  Thank you for all of your hard work! They are new, and as  they are getting the kinks out and I am sure they will be the best N/E Mesa has to offer!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite with my Beautiful Wife. The service was quick and the food tasty. We shared Calamari and bruschetta. I was impressed with the  on draft. We would go hear again."}
{"text":"Waitress was constantly apologizing, but it didn't change the fact that the restaurant was filthy and the food was bad. This place needs to change their decor and do some cleaning. The food portions are generous, but the entrees were lukewarm. The chicken in the chicken fettucine was burnt and somewhat rubbery. The menus were huge as well."}
{"text":"We read all the reviews, were in the area so we thought we'd try it. We started with the breaded panko mozzarella. It was very thick so that the cheese did not completely melt. Pretty bland with little flavor. The marinara was good though. I ordered the sliders since I read so many good reviews on them and my husband ordered the lasagna. Our salad was all lettuce and four little diced tomatoes in the corners. The dressing was flavorful but I would have liked some Parmesan or something. Our meals came and the lasagna was lukewarm. We sent it back to the kitchen and it came back a few minutes later... Same piece of lasagna. They must have microwaved it which is completely tacky. Sauce was bland and it was mostly cheese. My sliders were also disappointing. All I could taste was the burned charcoal flavor of the inside of the bread.  The server was wonderful however. She was super attentive, apologetic about the lukewarm meal, and quick to refill our drinks. Of course, there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. Overall, food was bland and lukewarm, and my husband's rating is Blech."}
{"text":"Pacino's fell short on all requirements of a good restaurant. So it is Valentines Day night. I called in ahead of time and asked about the wait time, a discombobulated hostess shouted about in my ear trying to find out who could clean tables and how long and finally tells me they have one table open. We were there in a matter of only 5 minutes and saw plenty of open tables but shrugged it off. We waited while the table cleared and were sat down. After waiting nearly 25 minutes I finally caught the attention of a hostess and asked when we could expect to see our server and if we could see a menu. It is only now that I am told no menus are available that I can only opt in for their $40 per person 4 course pre fixe meal and neither one of us are 4 course hungry. I just asked that she have the server come over to the table to talk with us. *now quick side note I am an extremely observant person so when we were waiting for a table to clear earlier at the hostess desk I noticed the woman who should have been our waitress crying and being consoled by a girl near the front desk. Now I also have an empathetic heart and had felt sympathy for the woman when I saw this but if she had something going on that was interrupting her ability to work she should have gone and spoken with her manager for a solution*  Our waiter finally did come over and asked if we had questions about the pre fixe, I mentioned that we had never been told it was the only option and asked if we could order al a carte from the options available for the night. I was very kind yet firm in my request and before I even finished I got an onslaught of excuses, \"the computers can't input that\" \"we don't have the capability\" he even went as far as to begin to explain their food coding system and then finally did the right thing and said \"let me check to see if that is possible\" his frustration showed through his voice and eyes but he came back and let me know they could and then inflated the al a carte prices pretty exorbitantly $25 for 5 shrimp raviolis $23 for their chicken with squash and scalloped potatoes on the side. His service got better as the night progressed and as he understood that my appreciation for him accommodating the request was not fake. My date said his food was good and mine was seeming the same until I bit into the middle of the ravioli and found that the center on each of them was still ice cold. I should have said something but I didn't, I was just tired from the day and the escapades already so I ate them avoiding the center on each. The food was good, minus the frozen centers, but I have to be honest in saying that Alessia's Ristorante Italiano down the way is of much better quality, taste and most importantly service. I also wanted to discuss the attitude of the owner, or at least I assume he was an owner or manager. He wore brightly colored red/orange pants with a striped orange shirt and graciously greeted every guest around us except our table. This was absolutely appalling! He even stopped by a table of what appeared to be regulars several times, laughing and personally removing their finished plates. I have a background with customer service and so I decided to give him a chance as not to misinterpret the body language of our table and looked him dead eye until he saw me and still I got nothing, not a polite head nod or a simple thank you. You really can not treat your guests like that, they have chosen to devote their time, money and valentines day to your restaurant and that is how you treat them? I think he is forgetting that his guests are who create their success, without us there won't be a need for what you have to offer. Any way, the only two good things I did experience were this, our waiters attitude finally turning around midway through our meal and I wish we would have been seated outside because I watched another waitress in a red dress hustling back and forth from the kitchen to the outside without skipping a beat giving her guests a great experience on their valentines day. I could tell because each person I could see through the open doors had a bliss filled smile on their face, the way everyone should have been made to feel that night."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is the welcoming service from the hostess to the server to the bartender.  The food is wonderful and happy hour is the deal of the century. Homemade lemoncello shots are heavenly!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. I was nervous coming here originally because this area has historically just been okay. This was a mistake. I had the buffalo blue burger and was amazed by the quality of the ingredients. Very pleased by our experience."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Pacino's. We love this place. Great food, service , and lots of fun. Very thankful for having this establishment close by. Frank and staff....thanks again!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly environment, reasonable prices. And i think I even met Mr Pacino! :) I recommend the crispy calamari and bacon wrapped shrimp."}
{"text":"We now have the real deal for Great Italian food right in our backyard of Las Sendas-Yippeee!!!!"}
{"text":"Difficult to give an accurate rating until I try some of there other dishes. I had the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli for dinner. I would give it a C+ based on having the same entree at Italian restaurants in La Jolla CA and NYC NY.  Yes  I understand this is Mesa Arizona and not a thriving big city with higher expectations. My first impression is that this establishment does not cater to the discerning foodie of Italian cuisine. The typical clientele are very casually dressed locals and seniors. My wife and I felt like one of the younger couples at Pacino's  My wife had the chicken Marsala and enjoyed it. She gave it a B for flavor and presentation. next time we visit Pacino's i will try the Chicken Cacciatore or Marsala and see.   Overall, I would say panino's is worth a try. The atmosphere is pleasant and they had a live band playing 60s music ( Van Morrison and cat Stevens)  The servers are pleasant and accommodating which is important for customers experiences. All and all it was a pleasant evening dinner with my wife, which is most important."}
{"text":"The house salad and dressing was good, my husband had the Oso Bucco and it was fantastic, I ordered the Carbonara and was disappointed, the pancetta(was it?)was extremely smoky --I never knew pancetta was smoked, cured yes but not so smoky ---it was even smoky for bacon.  Lost my appetite and didn't have dessert or even finish my meal.  The service was great and the waitress was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Reasonably priced foods!"}
{"text":"The service is pretty good.   Very nice man sat us, very kind.   The stars are for the food.   I requested light butter and the pasta was instead dripping with it.   When offered cheese on top,  I must have hit the threshold of the waitresse's 5 turns on the grater as she decided that was all I was going to get.  No salt and pepper but I hunted it down at the bar.  Great cocktail though.  The white vinegarette was the consistency of a hair product,  very little vinegar.  Made for a pasty salad and a shirt now stained with butter drippings.    Last but not least,  on my water refill,  I evidently got someone else's glass as it had lip prints on it and a mystery lime slice added to it, already squeezed. ... sweet!  Probably not coming back.   Looks like a popular place,  maybe just not my night to be here.  I do have an even disposition from the good cocktail and a nice waiter, just cocktails in our future."}
{"text":"The  owner  Frankie  is  on his game ... Food  is fantastic   And in spot ... Can't go wrong .. 5  stars !!!"}
{"text":"It's our go-to wine bar when we want to chill. Frank is so friendly, and the bartenders are all awesome. Definitely has a neighborhood feel to it. Be sure to sit on the back patio with the firepit table...very cool!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were there on a Saturday night.  The bar was full with quite a few folks outside on patios.  We decided to sit at a high top in the bar area to be able to see game 7 of the ALCS.  We were greeted warmly when we walked in and our server (Amanda) immediately took our drink order.  After order Inc our food it arrived within a very reasonable amount of time.  Quicker than we expected for a Saturday.  I had the Veal Parm which was very good.  The sauce was perfect with an almost smoked tomato flavor.  My wife had the Fettucini Alfredo.  Both of us left our plates empty but not wanting more.  I did leave just enough room to share the Salted Carmel Cheese Cake.  Perfect end to the night.  Amanda was great and hope to get back there soon."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill and FAST! Popped in for afternoon appetizers  Nothing special Sure do miss those meatball sliders! This restaurant was filthy! When did they deep clean last? Or sweep at all ? Walking out of the bathroom there were a pair of sunglasses in the floor tucked underneath a shelving unit by the bar Each corner is dirt and debris infested The women's room garbage can hadn't been emptied since ?  They must of had a sale in red, white and blue chairs for the patio which clearly taken away the original Tuscan Feel from the original opening.   Not sure if Frank is still there and if so, he doesn't care.    I am looking forward to the new Italian  restaurant that will be opening down the street.    East Mesa has been struggling for new choices in restaurants    Pacino' needs new management that care"}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere ! Great people there even great karaoke ! Bartenders are great with great service even tho it tends to be super busy , love the wine displays in the wall even the Italian gangsters are awesome !! Go there if you're looking for some good beers n good music"}
{"text":"The food was really good. My husband and I got the tour of Italy and the lobster ravioli and shared. The lobster ravioli was my favorite, yummy ravioli tossed with shrimp in a delicious creamy sauce, but all 3 entr√©es on the other plate were good too.  Our waitress forgot to bring us bread, so I'm hoping it's good, because we'll definitely be back.  We finished our meal with a lemon cake that was light and easy to finish off... all by myself...  Our waitress said they have Karaoke on Tues and Friday nights, so we'll be back with the teenagers because it's hard to find family friendly karaoke.   There was a guy tuning his guitar and playing a little at the end of the night. My little ones got up to dance to the music and he was so nice, he let them come up and play with him."}
{"text":"I tried the gluten free Dog Days pizza and it was one of the best gluten free pizzas! It had a very unique flavor because of the balsamic fig reduction. The crust was pretty good and had a slight sweet taste. I also tried the gluten free Scent of a Pizza which was just ok."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for a birthday lunch/dinner and I thought the food and service was outstanding. Shannon took very good care of us. I started off with the antipasto salad which was fresh and tasty. I really liked the balsamic dressing and the lettuce greens. I would have like more meat and cheeses but I still enjoyed it. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and it was delicious! The pasta was cooked perfectly (and I'm a snob about el dente pasta) and the chicken was cooked perfectly with a nice mixture of crispy outside and moist inside. They didn't skimp on the cheese either; melted to perfection and lightly browned. The sauce was a chunky tomato with just the right amount of seasonings. My husband ordered the meatball sliders which are a combination of pork, veal and beef and they were outstanding! Large enough that with the sliders and a salad he was full. I would order either of these dishes again next time I visit. And oh yeah...there WILL be a next time!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars cause every time I come I have exceptional food and service except for this new server. He basically got offended that the owners fianc√© gave us extra bread since we were out and grabs my moms arm all pissed saying \"I'm your waiter I'm supposed to get that!\" Like sorry someone beat you to it there's no reason to get mad like that especially to a customer. He's been giving off a bad attitude every time he's our server. Other than that I love coming here."}
{"text":"Huge shoutout to MEGHAN at Pacino's!! Our No Snow Paddleboard crew roll onto the patio every Friday night and she has provided nothing less than  exceptional service. People show up at random times and sit at different tables, yet Meghan manages the chaos seamlessly. Thank you Meghan and Pacino's for embracing the No Snow team!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - I live nearby and was happy to see that we had another locally owned restaurant in NE Mesa. But....the food and service just really weren't very good. The table was sticky, the service was VERY rushed (pressured to order, and then salads were brought out about 30 seconds after our appetizer) and the food was just \"meh.\"   We started with the brushchetta - which was incredibly dissapointing. The toppings were good enough, but it was served on flatbread which was cold and tasted rather stale. I prefer it on sliced bread like its made at Postino or D'Vine.   My husband had the orichette with sausage - it was oversalted and the sausage was pretty bland. I had porcini ravioli with a tomato cream sauce, which would have been much better had the sauce not been so oversalted.   The ambiance is ok - large TV's in the bar, which I guess are fine if you are sitting in the bar, but they were kind of distracting from the dining room.   I doubt we'll return, it just wasn't good enough for the $$$ spent."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food, we have always had good meals at Pachinos.  We were there again this week and enjoyed ourselves.  Only three stars because there always just seems to be something off about the service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was OK. First impression is ambience... and there was none. A few gangster pictures hung kind of hap hazardly about. Music was light rock?? Come'on..... it's Pacino's! No candles on tables. Just a neighborhood blue jean bar feel. Other than that, the food was OK. I hot the Cioppino. Salmon was very good, only 2 shrimp. Better name would be Calamari Stew with some salmon   Wanted to come here for a long time. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"As my husband and I sit here and eat our leftovers, I was inspired to write this review. Aside from the ambiance and people being so great, the food was outstanding. We had the calamari which was perfectly cooked and had a delicious sauce. Yum!  I had the Little Ears pasta which had great sausage, olive oil and pitted kalamata olives. My husband had the Tour of Italy with tender chicken parm, fettucinni, and lasagna. Initially they just brought out a serving of lasagna which was wrong so they boxed it, gave it to him, and brought him the correct dish. Cool! Huge portions, excellent food and a classy place, in a fun place.  I will admit the service was pretty slow but they were busy and good food takes time. Don't be in a hurry when you come here. Well worth the wait!  We will go again and again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Italian Mammas are whippin up old family recipes in the kitchen.  Pachino's portraits all over the walls.  There's a young guy, David; he doesn't have too many other tables to worry about, yet he manages to give your four top the perfect amount of attention.  Then you get your food, and it tastes great!  Very pleased with the food and service.  Will come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I love Pacino's happy hour! Great prices for drinks and a good variety of food. The staff is friendly and prompt.  They usually put on special entertainment events too."}
{"text":"The Meatball Sliders and the Bolognese was off the chain. Service, quality, and value well worth the visit. Perk"}
{"text":"Dear owners a) thanks for coming to ne Mesa aka restaurant waist land ... Ok we've got a few good spots out here in this beautiful corner of the valley but our visit today for lunch was excellent!!!! Our server was a delight . The beet salad was delicious as well as the mussels in a nice spicey tomato broth service was good as well"}
{"text":"Great Real Italian cuisine with great service. Combined with the atmosphere of music. Definitely coming back to Pacino's."}
{"text":"Best place to have a romantic meal!! The staff are wonderful and feel like family!! The food is as a five star restaurant should be, but with a casual and relaxing environment!! Absolutely the best Italian food I have had in twenty five years!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for HH.  They have a nice bar with plenty of wine and beer to choose from.  The food was good and they give you bread to eat when you sit down.    We had calamari and it what you expect.  Fried rings and bodies.  The marinara was good, had a little chili pepper i think which made it good.   The pizza was alright.  We ordered the margarita pizza.  Nothing special but it was what you would expect.    I would recommend this place over the wine place across the street.  This was our second time here and it was a lot busier."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. Absolutely terrible service there. We didn't even get to order our food because they sat us down, ignored us for 30 minutes and we walked out. The place was only half full so there was no excuse for the poor service."}
{"text":"Nice from outside and nice inside. We went for lunch. The food was excellent. We had chopped antipasto salad, chicken piccata, and chicken fettuccine Alfredo w basil.  The plates were large even at lunch and barely fit on the table. Outdoor seating area also. Prices at lunch were very fair. Service was great.   Restroom needs some help it isn't too appetizing."}
{"text":"Pacino's is home to my favorite bartender, Billy Zane.  Great happy hour, delicious food, and convincing specials that keep us dropping by just anytime we can find an excuse.  Treat yourself to some meatball sliders or calamari and a Peroni from the tap and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! It has a great atmosphere that is inviting and friendly. I love that you can come in here, have a few cocktails and feel comfortable and welcome. The food is good and you can tell that the owners really appreciate your business which I love when I visit local places. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Great menu across the board.  The meatballs are some of the best around, the sausage tasted homemade, the bread is all homemade...and the tiramisu was perfect.  The place has live music and the patio will be perfect once it cools down a bit."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is still open?  Depressing atmosphere and poorly managed.  If you advertise for an event you probably should see the event through even if you don't have a lot of people in attendance.  I'm adding that the bartender specifically told us around 11-11:30pm that the manager decided not to hold the event because there were not a lot of people."}
{"text":"Went with my gf, and ordered the fetuccini with shrimp and scallops. Plates a bit cold and way to much oil on the pasta. The vinegar salad had no vinegar, it just plain lettuce with a couple of onions, I would not recommend this place to any of my friends. I spent a couples of days in equator and had the same dish for 8 dollars, the plate was made with fresh ingredients and the plate didn't had as much oil."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite spot for my wife and I for a little over a yeae. We are never disappointed with the food or the service. Pacinos has 2 customers for life!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we felt like family. Frank, the owner adopted us and Brian our server/sommelier could not have been more attentive and humorous. We loved the attention we got and how the evening was made extra special with the personal attention we received. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place has changed dramatically. First, the menu is new and rather bad. Their osso bucco is gone. The new version are braised ribs which are disgusting. Terrible consistency and the sauce was terrible. My companion tried their scampi pasta, which was her favorite, and she said it now tastes disgusting. My bet is they're cutting corners with poor ingredients and it tastes like frozen food. That or the chef was replaced. To this add a band setting up and doing sound check for half an hour while we ate, and you can imagine why we felt terrible when we left. And we actually felt sick."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome food and concept. Their Risotto is off the wall, either with the seafood or mix grill. Highly recommend and I will be back."}
{"text":"Don't come here. We waited over 30 minutes for our food and my fianc√©'s steak was COLD! NOT edible..."}
{"text":"New Chef food is very good. Does a great prime rib. Osso Bucco is tender and delicious. Check out the specials. Had a bone in Ribeye with a sauce that was just amazing. Been there for lunch also. Calzones are big and delicious. Had the sausage and chicken pesto, both were awesome. They do Nice pizza also, thin crust, crispy and flavorful.  Great happy hour menu."}
{"text":"My family and I went for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious. Meredith was our waitress and she was amazing. The atmosphere was nice. The only issue was some of the food was a little cold."}
{"text":"This is a review of ordering take out. After the website prompts you to use full screen for online orders, you navigate the slow loading menu, and place your order, only to be it told that they don't accept online orders yet. So, I called. After twenty rings, they finally picked up and immediately put me on hold, where I have been for twelve minutes and counting. Finally, picked up again and they complained they could not hear my order because they have a live band playing. Really? How about moving the phone? It would have been quicker to go in and order and wait. I put up with it because the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening on June 1st, and loved it!  I was very glad to have an Italian restaurant opening up nearby, and was looking forward to getting in there and trying the food.  First off, the appetizers made the meal for me.  I got the meatball sliders, which were topped with pecorino cheese and arugula--delicious!  My boyfriend got the seafood plate (the name of which was in Italian of course, so you will forgive me for not remembering it), and it was even better.  The squid especially was cooked to perfection, and was probably the best I have ever had.  The sauce on the side paired with it perfectly, and the breading was superb.    The main dishes didn't disappoint--I got the funghi pizza and was blown away by how great it was.  The crust was perfection.  We had a slight hitch when the server brought my boyfriend the wrong dish (Pomodoro instead of Vognole), but it was quickly remedied.  He ended up eating most of the Pomodoro, and really liked it--the sauce was light and fresh.  When he got the Vognole, he said it was exceptionally good.  Dessert for me was only so-so.  They ran out of gelato (understandable given how busy they were), and we ended up with Panna Cotta, which I am not really a fan of.  Boyfriend ate it and loved it.  I also have to say that their bar prices are really reasonable.  Two beers and two amaretto and sours came to just over $15 with tax.  Overall, a great experience, and we can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I had the Cioppino special and it was delicious! Tender mussels, clams, calamari, flavorful scallops, shrimp and salmon chunks in a savory tomato based broth - the presentation looked as wonderful as it tasted. By far my favorite dish as Pacino's. The linguine was the perfect al dente and the fresh basil was a very tasty touch. As close to San Francisco or Boston style while in the desert.  Not to be left out - but I forgot to take a picture of it, I don't know why :D Hubby's Whitestone pizza with arugula kept him pretty quite until the pie was almost gone :)  We're lucky to live nearby and with food like this we'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and live band tonight. Food was yummy and friendly service. Love having them in our NE Mesa corner!"}
{"text":"Went to Pacino's for the first time yesterday. The food was really, really good. The wait staff was fabulous.  The so called jazz/entertainment left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't that the gentleman performing was bad, but it was so loud for such a small space on the patio.  There were four of us and we had to raise our voices to be heard by each other.  We had expected jazz or a more calming line-up of background music.  We will definitely go back but will call ahead to make sure it's not during a time they have entertainment.  This restaurant leans heavily on Italian influence... maybe some nice Italian background music would work better."}
{"text":"So we got here without a reservation about 40 minutes ago we're finally seated. We ordered the calamari. Horribly rubbery and well over cooked. Not to mention our poor server was WAY in the weeds. We then ordered Ceasar salads that we literally watch them sit in the window for 27 minutes....While watching the \"manager/owner talk to his buddy the whole time. Finally we got our salads. I ordered the \"chefs special\" the prosciutto wrapped filet....what a HUGE disappointment! Not only was it wrapped in BACON but the veggies were COLD! I mentioned this to the server who was way too busy to do anything about it. It was also covered in mushrooms which it did not mention in the menu...I HATE mushrooms. I have been a server for 22 years and was so disappointed in this place! Felt so sorry for the wait staff with not a manager in sight to help deliver food!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. We live nearby and we thought it would be good to try. The service was absolutely horrible and the food was even worse. I don't know how they get so many good ratings. We only ate there once and it was horrendous."}
{"text":"The Chef here is amazing!! If you want authentic Italian this is the place! Live music is always great as well!!"}
{"text":"We have been looking high and low for a good Italian restaurant since moving here to AZ and we finally found our Italian home.    The service was awesome, the owner Frank seated us took our order, delivered our food and even cleared the table. That tells ya something about his level of customer service and how he cares about his customers personally. The food was even better.   Love the Al Pacino movie history and art work too!  The spinach artichoke dip was very yummy I had chicken pacatta and my husband had chicken parmigiana....Ohhh my!  Anytime we want italian this will be it.  So yummy!!!!  Thank you Frank  Sam and Joel"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Pacino's! From the excellent hostess to the way they box your extra food for you away from the table, everything was fabulous!   We were greeted by a fabulous hostess and seated on the patio by Frank, ordering house wine and a delicious cheese and olive board from the Happy Hour menu.   We followed that with salads. My Roasted Beet Salad with Almond Crusted Goat Cheese was ridiculous! My SO who 'doesn't like beets' tried a bite and had to have more. The peppery greens and light and fresh dressing were topped with a little patty of goat cheese that looked lovely but small and inconsequential until I tasted it and realized how unbelievably rich and delicious it was.   He ordered and loved the Kale Caesar Salad with chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the house made Caesar dressing and croutons were amazing. I don't like creamy dressings but this one is so fresh and flavorful that it is used minimally and packs a huge taste. I even loved it!   We initially though about sharing a generously portioned pasta dish but were too full to eat any more and both ended up bringing home salad.  We have a menu full of reasons to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to meet for happy hour.  I always try to support the local businesses.  Their happy hour menu is actually now an all-day bar menu, meaning the specials run all day provided you sit in the bar.  They have a great outdoor patio space and often have live entertainment which adds a nice touch.  I have yet to order a dish that I didn't like.  I ordered the bruchetta and wings, but have tried many other dishes in the past.  The inside is nicely decorated and has an open feel.  They can accommodate groups with ease."}
{"text":"Great Experience....Went with my husband & teenage son, food was delicious.  Started with the meatball sliders, they are so tender, melt in your mouth good.  I had the bolognese, lots of flavor and just the right portion size.  The boys had the little ears, can't find this dish anywhere else and the FraDiavlo-pasta with clams, shrimp &  mussels. They were so tender and everything was served hot...I loved the bread and olives they put on the table...  The staff is friendly & courteous, good ambiance and the decor is very nice.  Great locally owned spot, which I always prefer to support the locals... will be back again and again !!"}
{"text":"July 14th was a special event for me.   I was planning a surprise proposal with a twist....Once my girlfriend said \"yes\", my plan was to surprise her with a wedding right there in the \"moment\"! Family flew in from Seattle, L.A., New Mexico and Texas. I also had friends and family from the area. I needed a venue that in my mind would create a comfortable-family oriented atmosphere.   A friend of mine told me he knew of the perfect place....Pacino's.   My friend was beyond right! Frank the owner made me feel like I was part of his extended family. Him and his staff were beyond accomadating. The atmosphere that night felt like hanging out in a large Italian kitchen as family mingled and ate great food.   I mentioned great food, because it was exactly that. I had around 60 people at the restaurant that night and everyone of them went on and on about how amazing the food was.   Pacino's is not just a restaurant. Its a place you go have a special \"moment\".....amazing food, great atmosphere and best service around!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the restaurant itself is a very nice restaurant, the food is better than Olive Garden but isn't amazing. The services has been hit and miss, the first time I went into this restaurant let me say it's extremely upsetting and rude when you have been waiting for 15+ minutes to get a table and once your sat down your told there will be a charge for $10 of the entertainment that the restaurant is providing. Let me say YOU DO NOT tell customers this once they sat down you tell them when you first walk in the door, I didn't come for the entertainment I came for the food! So beware of a possible entertainment charge you didn't ask for. I've only been here three times but I was disappointed this past time with the food portion size. Your paying at least $17 for food so the portion size better be big! It's sad when you pay that much for food and my pasta bowl is barley filled that's very disappointing. It wasn't just my food it was also who I was with their food was very small proportioned too."}
{"text":"Went to try this place for a wedding rehearsal and the food was mediocre at best and the server,  who was the manager, was slow and forgetful.  There were 2 other tables when we got there and it took over 30 minutes just to take our order.  I would never recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful, tasty and fresh food.. Pacinos is such a welcome treat in NE Mesa. The food is amazing with a combination of flavors that say someone cares. The salads (i have had all of them), pizzas and pasta dishes are delicious. Everything is fresh and homemade (or appears to be). The live music has been moved to the bar area which is a great idea. Great location with indoor/outdoor area for seating.  Keep on doing what you are doing Frank and family! We want to see you stay in Las Sendas Village."}
{"text":"What a find! Not in my neighborhood so when friends suggesting meeting for 2 for 1 lunch, it was a win win! Small but diverse lunch menu, delish grilled salmon salad. Plan to return for all day happy hour and the bar which opens to the patio. Fun vibe, with TVs, Italian food, music, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Always love coming in here. Great food, great people, great live music on the weekends. Happy Hour is always good. Check heir Facebook page for better news and updates and events with this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food that's consistent time after time. The staff is incredibly friendly and very knowledgable. If they offer some advice on the selection of a dish ...it's advice to heed. This place is def a keeper!"}
{"text":"Incredible Italian food!!!  The majority of the service is excellent. However, there are a couple of servers who are not the greatest...slow, forgetful, and inattentive. The main complaint I have is my order is often a little messed up each time I place it because I make a small change but it's not a deal breaker. I always feel very welcome when I am in here and love the fact that most of the people remember us. Bartenders are also great at suggesting drinks to try!  I prefer this place over Olive Garden any day!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Over cooked my steak, but otherwise pretty nice atmosphere. Service was excellent other than a bit rude picking up water glass and slamming it down."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I are sitting on the patio now. It's a nice patio however would rather listen to the band at dvine next door than the girl singing with her ipod now.  We came because we thought they were still running happy hour till close on Saturdays but found out that ended last week.  We get promotions end but what disappointed us most was pacinos has an awesome happy hour food menu that is only available during happy hour. We ordered the salami Sam  pizza which is excellent.  Pacinos, please make a bar menu that's available all the time and just charge more when not hh. We will gladly pay a dollar more for truffle  fries any time of day! Oh and update your website to remove the hh all night promo."}
{"text":"With the low reviews, we have avoided Pacino's. After a great night next door at D'Vine last week, we saw there were quite a few people in Pacino's and decided to give it a try. Walked in to less than half full dining room and waited to be seated. By the time someone came to seat us, there was another couple behind us. Live music was nice, but the noise level was very high and we decided to sit as far away as we could so we would be able to talk. Took forever to get menus and water. I noticed on the wall that Wednesday was half price wine night, only we didn't get a wine menu. We asked our server and she said she couldn't find any wine lists, but would tell me what the had at half price. The half price is more like what normal price should be. We settled on an Argentine Cab, although I really would have rather look over the list myself. Bread was a focaccia bread that was not impressive at all. Walls have a lot of marks/dings that need to be repainted. The best item of the night was the bruschetta. Sampled three different types and they were all very good. Salad was standard and nothing special. The sausage and peppers with risotto is misnamed. It should be risotto with a little sausage, peppers, and mushrooms. It really was a plate of risotto more than anything else. The other flavors barely came through. Desert was cannoli. Three small cannoli's that were very good. Entire service was very slow and seemed disorganized. Much better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Live music on Friday and Saturday nights. A woman singing and a guy playing the keyboard. Current and classic music. Something for everyone. Nice family setting. Great place to go for a kid free dinner, also. Good service. Food was ok-I like the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Was not overly impressed. The food was good but the service was horrible. When we arrived we were seated and the hostess failed to tell us of the specials. The waiter showed up at our table about 15 min after we were seated. He got us our drinks and appetizer and then we sat for another 25 min before he took our order. Again he failed to tell us the specials so we asked about them as he wasn't going to tell us - the only reason we knew about them is that we overheard another waiter telling the table next to us. He brought out our salads, however my Mom ordered soup so he had to swap it out - the soup was cold. Our meals arrived and we had to ask our waiter to take our dirty dishes as he felt it wasn't his responsibility. Again the meals were good and were hot when delivered. Overall good food but horrible service."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian meals I've ever had! We were greeted by Frank, the owner, as soon as we walked through the door. Because it was a beautiful night, we wanted to sit on the patio, so that's where he took us without hesitation.    Our waitress was there within seconds with water and to take our drink order. She also explained the specials which made it harder to decide on what to eat. :)   Our drinks came super fast and were perfectly made. We started with the shrimp scampi as an appetizer and WOW! I could have eaten them all myself but the portion size on the plate was definitely enough for two.   My friend and I went with one of the specials, Scallops with risotto. It was amazing. The scallops were cooked perfect and being a risotto snob, I was impressed with this one!   Then came dessert....holy homemade Tiramisu! This dessert is the bomb. I would go back JUST for that and a cup of coffee. The waitress was attentive and checked on us often, as well as Frank.   There was also live music in the bar area which was a nice touch to the warm atmosphere, we enjoyed it.  Everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"As it is very hard for my wife and I to identify our favorite food, having palates for the diversity the Washington DC Region has to offer in cuisine - what we do like to do is compare and categorize the local ethnic eateries, with the final outcome being whether it is favored enough to provoke our return to that establishment.  Pacino's Italian is one we thought would be one of those 'return to' places we've in this region.  Although for the diehard Italian food buff, this may not be the best place - it does fair well in its presentation, quality and taste.  Its presentation and attention to the service detail seems lacking, both the prices and quality of the offering are worth returning - depending on who serves you!  But, after such experience, we were pleased with the dishes we sampled.  The Zuppa and Diver Scallops were very good! The scallops were fresh, and the ingredients well portioned and tasty.  Our fave ended up being their excellent rendition of meatball sliders, and a very, very good Avocado, Basil and Tomato Bruschetta.  Although on our second visit the service was way off we might be inclined to visit them again.  They do make a good Rob Roy and their Cannoli is pretty good.  Overall, this is the kind of place you can go to have a quiet meal, without hustle and bustle and have the choice to be by an outside fireplace, or inside quiet area.  Bon App√©tit from G√°stro Ecl√©ctico!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Arizona, hands down without a doubt! MMmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with my buddy from New Jersey.  He highly recommended it from his last visit with family when they were here. Packed for a Saturday night and should've called for reservations but they got us in quicky. The owner was out talking with customers and mingling which is nice to see. Ordered the chicken marsala and he got the pasta bolognese. The portions are huge and the dishes were tasty. Love the decor as well since I'm a huge AL Pacino fan.  I'd definitely go back when its not as packed. They also had a live performer doing a mix of songs that didn't sound too bad."}
{"text":"So nasty, had been craving pasta all day so ordered a take out order. Staff was yelling across the restaurant to each other asking where the order was, finally located. Came home, the sauce had all spilled out from not closing the container correctly and was a puddle that just smelled bad. Shrimp was so rubbery could not finish. Huge chunks of onion in my meal. The onions were not listed on the menu. Over priced for nasty food. Only good thing was the bread."}
{"text":"I used to come here for karaoke by Robin as  well as dinner.  Unfortunately the owner canned Robin, had the bartender tell her it was her last night after he had left.  I'm very disappointed because it was a great place to enjoy good food and great karaoke.  Sounds like clear communication on the business end was lacking.  There are far too many other great places to enjoy that are closer to home though, since Robin was my primary reason for coming there."}
{"text":"Second time we have been to this restaurant. The food was terrible. Service was ok. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I really do love going to this hidden gem in Mesa, Arizona. Pacino's REAL Italian is exactly what it says it is. When I walked in, I was greeted promptly and with a smile. I was given a menu that was in bigger print than most restaurants which made it easier for these aging eyes to see.  I went in at about 6:00 pm and thought happy hour was over. To my surprise it wasn't. I quickly ordered a a savory dish called, \"Eggplant Rollatini\"."}
{"text":"Things just have gotten worse over the years.  The owner takes care of his buddies and if you're not in his inner-circle, good luck.  Some friends were there last Sat Nite so I reluctantly agreed to meet them there.  Despite my better judgement, I ordered a Calamari appetizer.  It will go down in history as the worst food I have ever eaten in a restaurant.  Cold, devoid of any moisture, and tasteless.  Basically a plate of dried out warmed barely -from-frozen batter.  I advised the waiter, who got defensive and did not take it off the bill.  Mixed drinks are in the tiniest rocks glasses I have ever seen.  No wonder the place is barely afloat."}
{"text":"Wish I could give No stars at all.   There was a brown, animal turd-like substance in my pancakes at Sunday brunch a few weeks ago. I a showed it to the manager, who made a face and said he'd check with the chef. He came back to say the chef didn't know what it was, something must have fallen in the batter, but not to worry. I really wasn't expecting much more than an apology, but I didn't really even get that. Maybe my meal should have been free. I think other places it would have been. So the manager comes back with a $10 gift card that he wouldn't let me use on that meal. I had to come back. And it expired at the end of the month.   Bad form, Pachino. I will never ever ever go there again."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Pacino's for the first time because of a meeting being held there.  I typically avoid Italian restaurants, since I'm rather picky and don't eat meat, pasta, or bread.  I was immediately impressed with the friendly and efficient manner in which Frank and Amy handled the needs of our group of 40+.  I ordered the calamari - one of the few things on the menu I thought I might enjoy.  To my surprise, I received a HUGE platter of calamari that was steaming hot and absolutely delicious!  Not one piece was tough or chewy, the batter was light but flavorful, and the sauce was perfectly seasoned.  Although I may never order any other dish there, I will definitely return for some of the best calamari I have ever eaten, exemplary service . . . and I look forward to happy hour, as well."}
{"text":"Not bad service but extremely over priced. I got a penne vodka pasta to go and the container isn't even filled. Tastes alright but for $17 i would rather go anywhere else."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The service non existent. The waitress seemed like she had better things to do. I asked for fresh parmesan and had to ask twice. The check was prompt and then no one came back to charge our credit cards. My husband had to find someone. That's the 3 stars"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a dozen times and have had everything from the meatball sliders to the seafood ciopini and the food has always been great.  Drinks are inexpensive even when not on happy hour and the live music adds to the casual atmosphere.  Great food at good prices."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The hostess told us they didn't have any seats by the fire outside. Then when we questioned it, she came back and mumbled something about a table fire & not being able to seat us there. Then our server was awful, too. We ordered a bottle of white wine & they didn't bring anything to chill the bottle with; we had to get up & ask for it ourself. Then we told him we were going to leave without ordering anything else & the waiter responded, \"well, I hope your night is good regardless.\" Very rude all around. They get a 2 star because the wine was decent. Bummed because it's so close to the house. :/"}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit here and every meal was excellent, fair priced and service is superb. The owner and his wife always check in with the customers and are always very pleasant."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, both times food was good. Portions are nice.  Service was very good. I would recommend this place. It's not the Ritz but it was good."}
{"text":"Door was held wide open as we walked up. Service started out a little shaky.  We were brought water and bread immediately and we placed our wine order.  We waited and waited. At this point we thought about leaving. I finally asked another waitress what happened to our drinks and she asked our waiter about it.  He said the barmaid forgot the order so he got them for us.  From here on out everything went smoothly.  We ordered Eggplant Involtini and it was excellent.  Just the right amount of sauce and mozzarella.  For our dinner we ordered the Portobello Ravioli to split and again it was a hit.  Earthy mushrooms in a creamy sauce.  If we would have had room we would have ordered the tiramisu.  Can't wait to go back because everything on the menu sounded so good. ( I believe our waiter was named Zack and he did an excellent job.)"}
{"text":"We were greeted promptly and our drinks arrived shortly after that. I had a 1/2 chopped salad and shared the sausage and peppers pasta ( the portions are big).  In the mood for Italian - stop by Pacino's"}
{"text":"We were warmly greeted when we arrived and promptly seated. Our server was very polite, pleasant and attentive. I wanted a glass of wine but didn't have a wine list but our server brought one as soon as I asked.  We ordered a Cesar salad to share. My son ordered pizza & I had the scallops with mushroom risotto. Everything was very good. The scallops were perfectly cooked. My only complaint is that pizza came before we finished our salad and before my scallops.  One other minor point of contention; there was no-one at the hostess stand when we left; it sort of felt like our evening was unfinished without being thanked for visiting or wished a good evening. We will be back; hopefully the very small annoyances will be resolved."}
{"text":"-Outstanding pork shank. Didn't use my knife once to get it off the bone.  -The other people in my party had the seafood paella special. It looked amazing, and their comments confirmed that.  -Superb live music. Actually accentuated the ambiance versus detracting from it, as is so often the case  I will be back next time I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Pacino's might be the closest thing in the desert that makes authentic tasting 'Italian' food. I came here for lunch recently with my son and was greeted promptly by the hostess. I ordered a lunch sandwich called the 'grinder' and my son ordered a huge calzone (that Mom finished off that evening for dinner). As an appetizer we had some sort of seafood appetizer which had seared scallops, shrimp, calamari strips, etc....the seared scallops were awesome! f I could just get an order of that.....heaven. Moreover, our dishes were great tasting.  The decor in the venue is nice. a few murals to Al Pacino....which were kinda creepy, however, tasteful. I suspect someone has a thing for Mr. Pacino.....because I saw a guy walking around the place who even looked like Mr. Pacino, however, was NOT him. The venue is nice.   I will return here, however, not for lunch, and perhaps a 'date night' with the Mrs. We will leave the kid at home.   So if you venture off to these parts, do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool. I had the beet salad with goat cheese and salmon and it was great. Nice wine selection as well. Great date night spot or just s cool place for happy hour! We will definitely go back soon!!"}
{"text":"Service was great and it had a really cool theme - all the waiters dressed in Al Pacino costumes from the movies.  My wife liked her scallops, but I didn't care too much for my chicken saltimbocca.  I think the whole pieces of sage over the chicken was a bit overpowering.  The broccoli rabe, while cooked well, needed a bit better of a wash before doing so.  The burrata was nothing to write home about.  3.50 for a draft Peroni is not only a great price, but it's tough to find on tap!  We'll be back for drinks and to try the pizza."}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Saturday....mistake! Why do they have poker that takes up 4 tables?     Extreamly short staffed. There was only one waitress running the whole dining room AND the bar.   I felt so sorry for her.  Some guy in all black had to be told to run food, even though the food was sitting on the pass for several minutes and he walked by it several times.      The cook had to come out and run food, that's how short staffed they were and it showed in the quality of the food.  My husbands steak was not medium rare but almost burnt. The Penne Ala vodka was kinda bland.  If it wasn't for the ONE AND ONLY waitress working her ass off and doing a damn good job I would have only given one star."}
{"text":"Everything that we have tried here has been amazing. Our entire family prefers eating here over Red White and Brew and DiVine Restaurants.  We haven't tried the pizza here so I can't say if that is good but  the pasta is amazing!  The appetizers are also great!  We have tried the eggplant, artichoke dip, and bruschetta and they were fantastic.   We all have different favorites here when it comes to the pasta but you can't go wrong with any pasta choice as all of pasta we have tried has been tasty.   The service is always fantastic, however, the chef will not accommodate you if you come in to eat around the time the kitchen is closing.  Can't really blame him for that.  Also nice patio!  Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews, service is good, food is DELICIOUS, wine was superb.  The portions are huge.  Over all you get good value and good dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch menu! Super reasonably priced with delicious food options. And there is live music! Great place to eat and enjoy good company and good music."}
{"text":"We were super excited to Pacino's because our friends had recommended it, but it definitely fell short. The vibe was awesome with live music and dim lighting. Our server brought water over as he greeted us, which was really nice. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and my husband had the shrimp ravioli. Mine came with a house salad which was basically just lettuce. Our food came out an HOUR later (one refill during that time) and mine was chicken, not eggplant. Another 10 minute wait and finally my correct meal came. It was ok, but I wouldn't order it again. Too bad because we were excited when we first arrived."}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour!!! The food & drinks are delicious and the service is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have had dinner here multiple times,  every time we come the food and service is amazing. The owner is warm and friendly. . Great neighborhood restaurant. We recommend the pizza and pasta and salads.  Definite must stop in east Mesa."}
{"text":"Food was marginal at best and too expensive. Service was attentive but borderlined being pushy and oppressive. It was pretty clear they were trying to turn over as many tables as possible. I am not interested in going back."}
{"text":"My hubby, dad, and myself came here for happy hour and we loved it. It has this neighborhood bar feel with amazing Italian eats. My favorite small dishes where the fried mozzarella and meatballs. YUM YUM! My hubby and dad love the wings and house chips. Their happy hour prices where great as well. I did not know that they had bands playing during the weekends. We will definitely come back and eat in the dinning room next time to try more of their main dishes."}
{"text":"We love Pacino's!  We eat something different every time and we are NEVER disappointed!  The specials are always delicious!  Not sure why they have ANY bad reviews!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found Pacino's last November while in Mesa planning our move.  Love this place.  My meatball sandwich was the best I've ever had.  We've moved to Mesa this month and had to go to Pacino's.  I tried the braised beef short ribs and it was heaven.  My husband ordered the Tres Carne pizza and it was fabulous.  Everything we've had there is delicious.  Frank and his staff love their customers and treat them like family.  We've already made our reservation for their Valentine's Day dinner."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, live music was good because it was not so loud you could not still have actual conversation with others. Sat on the patio was very pleasant because it was all shaded, however the patio could definitely use a power wash. Food selection was good and it tasted fantastic however some of it was not kept hot enough. All that being said I would definitely return. Can't beat the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined here several times.  The   food & service are pretty consistent.  My personal favorite is the sausage & pepper risotto.  My husband loves their lasagna. They seem to have good variety in the nightly specials Sunday brunch with live jazz is a hidden gem!  I agree with other reviews in that their take out service & online ordering are their weak spots."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place.  We won't be back.  The stuffed dates were pretty good, and the house wines for $5 a glass were good as well, though apparently they don't know a merlot from a cabernet.  My husband's chicken marsala tasted good and the chicken was high quality, but frankly you can get good chicken marsala a lot of places.  But.....I had the special which was shrimp parmesan with pasta and broccolini.  The shrimp were deep fried and the coating was bland.  They tasted like something pre-made out of the freezer.  They were sparsely sprinkled with what looked like Kraft powdered parmesan from the green shake can.  Then we come to the red sauce on the pasta.  It seriously tasted like nearly unseasoned canned tomato sauce.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  Then we tried to pay and their credit card machine wasn't working, of which we had not been warned.  My husband had to leave, go get cash, and come back.  The waitress was very attentive and we gave her a good tip because nothing was her fault, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"First experience here was a Friday business lunch a week earlier.  The place was not busy and the chef agreed to make us Cioppino which is only on the dinner menu, and we gladly agreed to pay the dinner price  No problem, as everything was fantastic and we couldn't believe the serving size.  Returned the following Saturday with a party of 7 and a reservation at 5PM.  Tables had not been set up, but we let it slide and sat down for a great meal.  Took at least 15 minutes for our server to deliver all our wine / cocktail orders, she never brought an ice bucket for the white wine, and when the main courses arrived they were only mildly warm but fortunately still tasty.  Didn't complain as the place was super busy by that time, but then a girl singer showed up and set up a speaker about 6 feet from our table blaring out very annoying  popular music.  Couldn't carry on a conversation and it ruined our evening.  Before we left, I spoke to the owner Frank and suggested that it would be more appropriate if he had some nice Italian background music that fit the otherwise pleasant ambiance.  His answer was \"we only have live entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights\".  Hence, he certainly won't be seeing us again on either of those nights, and most likely never again. This experience explains why restaurants do not last very long..............."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Used to live nearby, and we'd come here when we had a hankering for Italian we can't make at home. I wasn't blown away by the food, but it's solid, traditional Italian. I was usually sad when the bill came,wishing I'd had a better meal for the price."}
{"text":"Take it from a Native New Yorker ..... Pacino's is the best spot for Italian food in the East Valkey... Great owner and staff, and the atmosphere is classy casual.... Alfredo sauce is the best I've had in a long time.... Check it out!"}
{"text":"After getting into it with the owner for a bit and told I was wrong and they have one of the best Pizza in the Valley. I still disagree... He gave me a gift card for the total I paid to try it again. My friend and I went back yesterday to give it another shot. Im rating it 2 stars because the service was great. The food however was still pretty gross and not consistent. I had fried mozzarella which was bland, and I regretted eating the meatball sliders at 3 in the morning. I tried my friends truffle fries those were bland. I also tried a slice of his pizza I still agree your better off with Red Baron Pizza from Albertsons. My buddy agreed. Total disappointment. I will never walk into that place again."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it more based off how good the bread they brought was. Took an hour before food was done. Had it put in togo boxes. Our 2 year old couldn't hang. Short staffed for sure"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on Friday night for dinner since it was close by their house and wanted to give it a shot. Our server was super friendly and did a great job. Food was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but definitely better than Olive Garden. The problem here is the insane amount of time it took to get our food. We waited almost an hour to get our food out, and we ordered pretty simple dishes. They are either short staffed or just incredibly lazy in the kitchen. The owner, or manager I assume had his wife or girlfriend there and she was all over him. That's pretty unprofessional in any kind of business. Maybe he should spend some more time retraining his staff or hiring rather than flirting."}
{"text":"Incredible. One of the best restaurants in East Mesa. Food is 10/10 I would recommend anybody coming to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pacinos has great food and friendly service.  Went last night to hear Journey and more tribute show. Was disappointed that there wasn't much of Journey being sung by David Alcantar. He does a great job as Steve Perry. Felt like I was watching and hearing the Wedding Singer. More Journey David!"}
{"text":"If you want Italian food with absolutely no depth of flavor or imagination then you've come to the right spot. The food is not what I'd describe as bad, but rather has earned the label of boring and tasteless. Service was good, food mediocre."}
