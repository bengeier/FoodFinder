{"text":"I'm conflicted with this place.  I was fortunate to have sampled the pork belly and flour less chocolate brownie on a separate occasion and they were phenomenal!  So I wanted to try out their other items, went for lunch and most tables were taken but we were able to find a seat.   Ordered the mac and cheese and fried green beans and number 1 burger with the regular fries.  Both the beans and fries were over salted and almost made it difficult to eat.  The Mac and cheese was ok, just had higher expectations for this dish.  Even the presentation was lacking, no garnish or garlic toast. The portion and price was right though.   The burger for me is what saved my rating from a 2 star.  Super flavourful, it could've been more juicy though as some part of it was over cooked but still a good burger.  One more thing about this burger, it comes with a fried egg, the yolk was cooked through and through which I don't like.  Should've been a little bit softer so you could get some runny yolk, sure makes it a very messy meal but IMO yummier!  Service was alright, the head server or bartender she could've been a little bit more personable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome selection of beer and wine. Staff is always happy and the patio rocks on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive and friendly. Wanted the 1/2 chicken entrée but they were out of it. At 5:30pm on a Thursday! Order the burger. It was very good. The patty was not too greasy and cooked just right. The fries were nothing special.   They claim to source locally whenever they can which is great. Prices are very reasonable.   The inside is well designed but a bit noisy. I guess that's to be expected for a pub.   I would go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went there two days ago, our server came to take our drink order & was pulling her shirt down while talking to my boyfriend, & then picked her teeth at our table !!! we immediately asked for the bill after we got our drinks, the drinks we had were absolutely disgusting, super watered down & didn't even taste like it was suppose too !!!!! horrible service ! & the waiter was so stupid she gave us back the money we gave her because she couldn't count properly."}
{"text":"Would come back to this place never. Bad service and the food did not taste very good and came out late.  Waitress made a mistake on our order and did not take responsibilty for it. We had barely touched our food when we asked for the bill to leave, the waitress did not ask us how we were or why we didnt touch the food."}
{"text":"This place is hype! They're daily specials are all great! Tuesdays oysters for a dollar , Wednesday half off ALL bottles of wine!!! And they have some BADASS Mac n Cheese !!! This is probably my new fav spot in the city  I enjoy the service , and they always playing the game! I'm going to try a bottle on Wednesday! I suggest u try this place it is worth it! There's A lot on the menu to choose from!!!  BOOM! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like that this place serves craft beer and has an \"eat local\" focus. I had the burger and fries. The burger bun was a bit greasy, but the patty and fixin's were super. You can taste the quality in this burger. It came with a generous side of fries that were cooked to perfection.  I had it with a sampler of four craft beers, two of which were very tasty and the other two, not so much.  I also had the ice tea, which I found pleasantly surprising. No artificial powder or syrup-based ice teas here, but rather the brewed kind, which they make fresh every day. It is hard to find brewed ice tea in Calgary and theirs knocked it out of the park for me.  The service was prompt and efficient. Our server was pleasant, laid back and what-you-see-is-what-you-get. She was genuine and you got the feeling that she liked working there.  It's a steep set of stairs down to the bathrooms. I couldn't help but wonder if that might pose a danger to some? Bathrooms were clean and modern.  The restaurant filled up quickly with the after-work crowed and it got pretty loud. As long as you don't mind the volume levels, this place is a must-try.  I am a fan and plan to return again soon."}
{"text":"A disappointing meal and service.  I ordered the Niçoise salad, which the menu says is potatoes, tuna, green beans, egg, and olives (i.e. a Niçoise salad).  When it arrived it was a plate of mostly mixed greens with two small potatoes, tuna, and some sliced egg.  Not at all substantial for an $18 main meal salad.    I called the server to explain that the meal was not as advertised or substantial.  She offered to bring something else, but I informed her that I don't want to waste the food; I'd eat the salad.  She confirmed that she would discount it.    After ordering dessert and having another drink, the bill arrived with a 10% discount applied to the salad - that's $1.80. I informed the waitress that this was not what I expected.  The manager was called and explained that because I had eaten the salad I had \"accepted it.\" I informed her that I don't like to waste food and I had told the waitress this.  The bill came back with 25% discount applied to the salad.  Insulting.  We paid, tipping the waitress since this was not really her fault, and left.    I emailed Ric the proprietor of Midtown and was impressed by the timely and constructive response.  In this end this was a mis-understanding that could have been handled better.  I will return and alter my expectations a little."}
{"text":"Came here for beer and oysters. Great beer selection. I like it over some of the other beer bars because of the size of the locale...it's cozy. I can see this place being my go-to place for beer in Calgary.   Food-wise, can't say much as I only had oysters. Buck-a-shuck Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I second one of the comments below mentioning the locale. Also being a resident of Kensington, I was excited for this place to open. However after two visits I have decided to not go back.   The first visit consisted of poor service and long waits. When the food eventually arrived it was sub-par at best.   The second time around the service was a little better - but we still had a long wait and again received our lunch that was nothing to speak highly of.   I'm not professionally trained in food preparation and have little culinary skills, so when I go to any restaurant I expect a meal that I couldn't prepare myself. If I know that I could make the lunch/dinner delivered to me at home and have it taste better than what is in front of me; believe me, that speaks volumes of the chef and kitchen staff."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and I've had good and average meals and service here. It seems like you'll get the best service and food during their busy times like weekday evenings vs weekend afternoons. They do have a lot of rotating draught beers which I appreciate but the last time I was there they seemed to have mostly IPA's then lagers, one Amber and no wheat ales. Sadly there wasn't anything on tap that looked interesting. The food is pretty good although I'd like to see more choices for brunch since there's usually only around four."}
{"text":"I tried this place about a week ago, I had the pulled chicken sandwich and French press coffee (I was driving so I wanted something other than beer). Food was great, coffee was incredible, but the staff were dry as toast. Highly recommended for food and drinks, I had a look at their beer menu and it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Had a flatbread and it had 8 slices; great portion! The service was slow. We waited a long time for drinks, refills, and food. Some of the services had enthusiasm while others were very cold and dry. This made the atmosphere uneasy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a weekend brunchy lunch while in the neighborhood. I really love the decor in here, its sort of modern rustic if there is such a thing. Lots of natural light, wood flooring and rich tones. I'd say Midtown is sort of a gastropub, but likely more than that as they have a well stocked bar.   On weekends they offer a brunch menu from 11-2, with some classic breakfast fare along with burgers, salads and a few sandwich offerings.We came around 1, and found the restaurant about half full, with a mix of clientele, including some young families with children.  I chose a pint of wild rose and the triple decker grilled cheese with the soup of the day, which was cream of mushroom. Our beers came out promptly, and our meal was only a short wait after that.   The food wasn't really up my alley, but maybe I made some bad choices. The triple decker grill cheese was just to much bread, I probably would have enjoyed a slice of tomato to cut the richness instead of more bread - but then it wouldn't have been triple decker. I also might have liked if it was a different kind of bread, maybe on sourdough or even a light rye, instead of standard, square loaf white bread.  It was also overpoweringly garlic flavored, which distracted a bit from the cheesy goodness. The soup wasn't for me at all, I had envisioned a classic cream of mushroom soup but their interpretation was a simple pureed soup of mushrooms and cream.   I'd like to come back for a casual afternoon pint again and to try some more of their offerings as I suspect there is more to them than what I chose. It's a bit to pricey to be a regular haunt for me, but at the same time it's a nice to have more choices in Kensington."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday morning around 11:00AM, there was no wait at all. Staff were quick and helpful. The ambiance is great, especially when sitting outside on the patio.   I ordered the eggs Benedict special, it was beautifully presented. (See attached picture) Overall the meal was good, however the eggs were overcooked. They should ask how we want the eggs done.   Interestingly, they could not prepare an iced coffee. Perhaps they are not aware of the logistics of preparing coffee and pouring it over ice?   Regardless of the eggs, I enjoyed the meal. Sadly I think the eggs really ruined the experience. The eggs are the star of the eggs Benedict, and were a let down"}
{"text":"Busy and upbeat pub with decent wine list, wasn't eating but good coming out looked good!"}
{"text":"Very good bier selection, very nice food presentation.  However poor service and cooking accuracy on the low side (insufficiently cooked Brussels sprouts, missing about 10 minutes) takes away most of the pleasure."}
{"text":"This is the old Broken plate location, the Midtown folks have done some great work renovating the place and with bottle house having changed management recently, we've been looking for a place with good beer selection and so far Midtown has delivered.    I recommend having a quick snack of their delicious grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It's in my neighborhood of Kensington so I'm a big proponent of all new businesses that open here.  The first time I went for dinner, the experience fell flat. I gave it another chance and went for beers another day. And blah, again.   My first time I had the mussels, rotisserie chicken and fried green beans. The green beans was the best item of the three. Crispy and tasty, but then again all deep fried food is tasty. Their mussels were presented in a shallow plate that was almost like a platter. This was ridiculous because anyone who has ever had mussels knows that you need to serve it in a bowl so that the SAUCE stays in one place for you to scoop. In this case, the sauce was running all over the platter, it was so amateur. The mussels themselves were not very good either. The chicken wad forgettable. Nothing extraordinary.  The second time I went for drinks I ordered a root beer float type drink which was pretty much undrinkable. They did change it for me upon my request though.  Service was impersonal and sparse both times. Too bad.  Disappointing that this place did not live up to my expectations, as we could have really used a good solid bar/restaurant in this neighborhood. I might go back to Midtown if I'm invited there by friends or whatever, but I'm not going to go seek it out myself. There are so many better places in town with the same concept but doing it 100 times better!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Midtown at the tail end of our YYC Hot Chocolate Fest tour around Kensington. Had head some mixed reviews on the place but their hot chocolate sounded good (plus there was hunger) so we stopped in.  2 of the group had the hot chocolate and said it rated right up there with the ones we had tried that day, they just forgot the cherry on the top - literally. It was meant to come with a cherry and they got none. Then saw another table get hot chocolate with cherrys.   It was really busy in there and they had 3 servers for the whole restaurant. Not sure if that is normal on a Sunday for them, but if so they need to add some more servers.  Food wise tried the fish tacos and they were ok. Corn tortilla and chunk of fish on top. They are little ones but it was an appetizer so that's ok. Just not blown away by the taste. It wasn't bad, but doesn't make me want to go back just to have them and fish tacos should do that. Other places get theres to make me want more so feel they can too.  The burger on the other hand looked awesome. It was really big and juicy with a good size helping of fries. Clear winner and my friend loved it.  Nice selection of local beers too.  Will I go back? Probably not unless I am walking by and I am starving. But then there are so many great food options in Kensington that I will probably walk on a little further to that other burger place (not name dropping) and stop in there."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of both the food and service. Although the drinks were good, I waited a very long time to receive a board of duck liver pâté accompanied by a near-rotten orange slice, waterlogged greens and rock-hard slices of garlic bread that resembled hockey pucks. After staring at the appetizer board for some time, longing for it to be taken away, a different waitress brought out our entrees. She had great difficulty setting down the two plates with the forgotten appetizer board still in the way. We both ordered pasta- the macaroni was extremely overcooked and very mushy, while the tagliatelle featured soggy, slimy mushrooms. After picking though our entrees, we looked up to ask our server for the bill and  much to our dismay we ended up watching her blow her nose into her bare hand.   I was absolutely disgusted by my waitress' actions and the poor food, especially for the heavy price tag at the end of the meal. Please save your money and dine elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Being a \"close-to-Kensington\" local, I've been to Midtown on many occasions. It's really great. Also sometimes it's not. Here's the deal.  I'm a fan because I feel like Midtown gives a damn about the local craft beer scene. ON first glance they're in the same vein as Kensington's OJ's or Yardhouse, but take a closer look and you'll see they're local. They've got a bunch of locals on tap and regularly hold cask nights where a local brewery bring in some sexy, new creation.   I'm a fan because the food is great. I've been wowed by their flatbread on many occasions, from coming in for a late night after plenty of drinks down the road at Oaktree and muchin' on a mushroom one. I can't remember what it was called because of those oak tree drinks, but it was the one with lots of mushrooms. To this brilliant sweet and savoury during Yelp's Pizza Crawl during YYC Pizza Week. Their kitchen staff have got some uber cool concepts worth paying close attention to.  The service can be rad here - I've had some great nights. But... Whenever things don't go the way in which I'm thrilled to get back to my computer and share my experience with the world it usually has to do with something here. Sort of a disconnect between between staff, bar, and kitchen. On new years I wasn't sure who was working and who wasn't. I get that it's new years and staff want to have fun, while pleasant when attentive, it seemed as if most staff committed to the \"it's slow tonight, so I don't have to do anything\" mentality. Which sucks. I feel I can relate to reviewers who have had 3 or 2-star experiences. I understand that right now I may be more in love with the idea of Midtown than the actual bar, but I really do think they have what it takes to pull it off and be a beacon of fun times in this city, and I hope they're willing to take some constructive criticism along with knowing that I think they're pretty damn rad. Glad to have you in my hood, Midtown."}
{"text":"Had the rotisserie chicken 1/2, ordered with skinny fries, came with southern gravy  Nice sized chicken but blood and raw near the bone at thigh and breast  Gravy sort of flavorless white paste, fries under fried   Service excellent  Maybe come and drink after dinner"}
{"text":"I go to Midtown A LOT as I live just down the street. I appreciate the location and the ambiance. I enjoy their wines (great Malbec) and their charcuterie selection. Their specials are pretty awesome too (taco Thursday is the best).   However, do not go there if you are in a rush!! I have never been there where the wait times have been under 45 minutes for our main meals. And as I said previously, I have eaten at midtown A LOT.   The staff seems to have improved from its early days where they were rude and unpleasant but the wait is still forever. Keep thinking it will change and it doesn't. I have complained about the wait, once specifically where it took over an hour and the waitress was a bit snotty and then gave us some free popcorn. Then I complained to the manager and they gave us our meals for free so at least that's something.  Foodwise:  Their pulled chicken sandwich is dry and disappointing Wine selection and general drink selection (especially local beers) are amazing Charcuterie is delicious and a lot of cheese/meat selection Tacos are generally very tasty mussels are good (lime cream sauce to die for!) but the bread that comes with it is disappointing (think a dry prison ration of wonderbread) Poutine gravy is delicious but the poutine always looks a bit dilapidated when it comes out. Put some more fries on there!   Overall, I will continue to go there, but I will complain about it."}
{"text":"Love the quality and delivery style of food. Very innovative. Place started as another pub but has come long way to establish a a go to place for lot of signature dishes"}
{"text":"Gave this place another try yesterday after having a bad experience years ago and never going back. I had heard they changed their menu and management but was still very disappointed. The service was bad, the drinks are over priced (I ordered a happy hour drink at 8:55 and she rang it in full price instead of just mentioning that it wasn't happy hour yet) then we went for the feature taco special. The pork tacos were practically empty and the fish tacos had zero sauce on them. The experience was once again very average and I wouldn't go back. Many other delicious places to go with taco features and happy hour specials that I'm sure you'd actually get a happy hour price on!"}
{"text":"Such a swanky place! (And I love swanky places)  Service: Services was just alright here. There were long wait times after being seated. We went during lunch time, so it wasn't too busy at the restaurant. However, once the server came around it got a bit better. She was personable, and she knew the menu well!  Food: I had the fish and chips! I was wanting something greasy, but delicious. The fish was a nice honking size. Tasty too!  Drinks: They had a nice cocktail list. Had all the classics, but they had good variations as well!   Atmosphere: They have a pretty cool atmosphere. Industrial, but has great windows to people watch.  Overall, I'd probably come back if friends asked me to come out there. However, wouldn't go out of my way to say hello!"}
{"text":"Picture a rainy Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend and I popped in here for some food. He got the brisket sandwich with fries and I got the steak sandwich. Hands down, the best meals we have had in a while and we have been to many restaurants around Calgary. The Brisket was full of flavor and the meat, just like the steak, melted in our mouths. The ratio of the contents of the sandwich to bun was on par. The Beer selection had a bit of everything from porters, Pilsner to lagers. The wait staff was extremely friendly and our wait time was next to none. They turned a rainy day into a nice one."}
{"text":"Some really decent food and a well curated tap list for your beer selections. They have wine and mixed drinks but I don't care about either, so I can't comment on how great a bourbon Manhattan they do, though I hear they're pretty tasty, nor how leather-and-dark-fruits their house red is, though I'm sure it's like eating a plum on a new leather sofa.   It's almost downtown without the pain in the ass that is downtown. Admit it, it's true. Downtown is a pain in the ass, we all know it. Easy access to the LRT.   They do cask wars on the last Monday of the month, so it's a great way to sample the best of two breweries. And whose Monday couldn't use a little jazzing up?"}
{"text":"What do you do in Calgary when the sun is shining and the weathers warm? You go for patio beers of course! On this particular occasion our end destination was Kensington. Rather than hit one of the usual spots like Molly's, Original Joes or The Yardhouse we decided to try somewhere new, this led us to Midtown Kitchen & Bar. We tried Midtown for dinner on a separate occasion and we were pretty happy with the food and service, so we were ready to give them another go.  The restaurant itself is quite nice compared to the usual options Kensington offers. Upon entering it's very clear that they've put in a fair bit of time and money to create a restaurant with a modern feel that really stands out amongst the competition nearby. What makes it really cool is they've incorporated shades of rural and rustic into the decor and atmosphere. It's open and warm but it can feel a bit hectic and busy when it fills up which takes away from the coziness you'd want in a place like this. As for outside, the interior appeal doesn't translate well to their small side patio; Kensington has always struggled in this area as their curb space doesn't allow for significant patios. The bigger patios in the area are always incorporated into the restaurant space rather than relying on the sidewalk; unfortunately the patio at Midtown was more of an afterthought. Simply put, the patio is small, plain and doesn't fit with the beautiful interior.   We were just happy to find a spot as all patios tend to fill up pretty quick on a Friday after work. The food and drink selection is more of your gastropub variety, a step above a conventional pub. They have lots of great and unique ingredients and also a strong selection of draft and craft beers, so on the surface they are quite appealing. Where I was lost is how everything came together, despite sounding good on the menu and even having pretty solid presentation, it just did not deliver on the high flavour and taste expectation the restaurant had set for itself. We both ordered Rueben Sandwiches and the Deep Fried Pickles to start. For drinks I had a beer sampler flight (restaurant preselects 4 beers to sample, 5oz each) and my fiancée had a Wildrose Wraspberry. She definitely won that round as I was given a pale ale, 2 IPAs and a porter, a bit disappointing as these usually aren't the kinds of beers I'd like on a hot summer day. Hopefully they update their sampler selection soon to something more summery. The Deep Fried Pickles were as expected, it's a dish that never blows me away anywhere and you usually know what you're getting. But of course I had to curb my fiancées craving as any good man would :). The Reuben is where things really fell apart for us, it tasted heavy and was greasy/messy, and it really did not deliver on expectation at all. The fries were a tad too garlicky, but the parmesan was nice. As for our server, she started off pretty unpleasant and did not seem excited to be there or serving us. She was quick with refills and check-ups, and her mood did progressively improve but the initial impression was just off and there was nothing wow with the experience overall.   So where does this leave Midtown for me... Honestly I'm conflicted, it's beautiful aesthetically but the food just really didn't impress and was a miss for us. The patio experience was meh and the service was so-so.  Overall it felt like an average experience that I could've got at any other pub in Kensington. I'll definitely give them another go, probably brunch or dinner next time. There are lots of other places to try in the area though, so this one won't be a rush return visit for me."}
{"text":"Service service service. Knock it out of the park everytime. Taco's on Thursday with social hour on drinks I'm a happy girl.   All while watching the street life in Kensington. Taco's a big dry but it's 2.50."}
{"text":"Gosh I've been here so many times I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. My first visit was for their grand opening, the most recent time was in December with a girlfriend. We landed here on a Wednesday evening and were thrilled to learn it was half price bottle of wine night - score.  I've always liked the food which is why I keep coming back. It's not far from where I live and has a cool bistro vibe. Prices are fair, food is good. Lots of great beers & wine to choose from. This last visit I tried the fish & chips. Being a West Coast girl I am very fussy when it comes to fish & chips...these delivered. My dinner date had the Roasted Root Vegetable Salad. She was also pleased.  A fun place to hang out with friends, a date or family. Oh yes they allow kids until 8 or 9 I think - another bonus!"}
{"text":"Usually order the chicken Take Home for 2 Rotisserie Chicken which includes a Whole Sunrise Farms Chicken, House Cut Fries, a large Field Greens Salad & Farmer Gravy for $32 which is a decent deal and good quality, tasty food.  Tonight decided to try the Take Home for 2 St. Louis Ribs with 4K Farms Pork Ribs, Apple BBQ Sauce (which is not a side but on the ribs - the chicken comes with a full container of gravy), House Cut Fries & Harvest Slaw for $35. I was shocked at the tiny portion sizes compared to the chicken meal for the price they are charging. Less than a 1/3 of a container of fries (with the chicken meal it's always been full & the salad came in the same sized container) and 1/2 a cup of coleslaw for 2 people is not a meal. I inquired with the staff and they were dismissive. The fries are soggy and undercooked and the coleslaw is tasteless. The ribs are cold and barely sauced.  To set the expectation based on what is served with the chicken dinner and then serve this seems wrong.  Don't think I will be returning here again."}
{"text":"I missed out on Midtown's opening night, but glad I got to make it up with lunch over the weekend! I'm enjoying this new joint that has taken the place of the old Broken Plate in Kensington.  What to expect: An extensive drinks list! It takes up the entire inside of the menu. Food items take half the space on the back. Also, local, local, local. You can call it a trend if you want, but I've been making a conscious effort to eat local produce even when I'm at home and what a difference it makes not only in taste/flavour, but in how I feel after eating my meal as well.  I would classify Midtown's food as comfort food. Some sharing plates, some individual meals... for lunch I thought I'd carb load. A pint, gorgonzola mac & cheese and greens on the side... ok, crispy green beans... deep friend in tempura. There's still green in there! Man were those addictive. Crunchy, salty... I ate every last one.  I learned a word while I was in Vancouver to describe restaurants like Midtown. Sophisti-cajz (there's an ongoing debate it seems on how to spell the abbreviation of the word casual). Anyway, it's delicious, gourmet food served up in a casual way!"}
{"text":"After working 6 days we wanted to relax eat a great burger and try a new place. What a mistake! My coke came in a PLASTIC cup, what am I 3 years old? The waitress hated that we ordered a bottle of sparkling water with ' limes on the side' why the disapproval when they charged $8.00? The food took 26 minutes to arrive and everyone but 1 table were already eating. Berger was incinerated, street tacos were cold, but the mac & cheese was very good. Our waitress was busy spraying and wiping tables and ignoring us. Another waitress delivered the food??  What happened to hot food, juicy burgers and HAPPY wait-staff?? Never again The one star is for the mac&cheese"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and a friend for brunch. We were surprised when it was empty.  The service was very slow even though it was empty.  The waitress didn't take our order with a pen and she messed up my order.  The food did not come as described, we were told the pancakes come with 4 and were huge. My friend got three medium sized pancakes.  The food didn't blow me away at all.   For the price it's not worth it. Don't think il return."}
{"text":"Midtown is my favourite local happy hour PLUS they have excellent daily specials and they're mega supporters of local beer. For that, they get my 5 stars.  As I write, happy hour (\"social hour\" to Midtown) is 3-6 p.m. every day, plus 10-midnight Friday & Saturday. The deal includes several well-priced snacks which change from time to time. My go-to is the parm truffle fries, though the tots are great too, esp. if you're sipping beers. Other happy hour snacks right now include pork sliders, deep fried pickles, chips and fish cakes. They've had mussels and fries on there in the past which is also so satisfying and priced right. Basically good stuff to pair with beer.  The daily deals especially bring me out. Tuesday is $1 oysters and $6 pints. Thursday is $2.50 tacos and $7 beer flights--those tacos make for a good, cheap lunch.   In addition to $1 oysters, their support of local breweries is a big part of why I choose them out of all the places to go in the neighbourhood. Keep it up!  I haven't sampled much of the regular menu. It's priced probably a few dollars more than I would expect to pay in a pub."}
{"text":"This place has a good feel to it, though I was a bit surprised at how much smaller it was than I thought it would be. Our waitress never gave her name but she was prompt and professional, but not overly friendly. I had a long island iced tea; stiff and delicious, no complaints there. My boyfriend and I had street tacos to share, which are not only adorable but delicious as well. The Mac and cheese was spicy and creamy, obviously delicious.   My only slight complaint is the fact that they let children in the bar. Now I don't mind kids at all, but I always go to the lounge side of restaurant when I'm enjoying a few drinks. Obviously the behavior of the kid sometimes can't be helped, which I understand as well. I'm just not a fan of kids in bars.   Overall, super great food and a pretty great staff."}
{"text":"First off I want to say that the waitress that served us was like a robot. No people skills at all. While paying for the bill she just stood there. Normally small conversation about the weekend or something. Not a word...I found that very strange. However the food was amazing. I had the fish & chips & my husband had the Italian burger. Both were very good. I would revisit & sit in a different section."}
{"text":"Buck a shuck Tuesdays! Need I say more? They only have 2 kinds of oysters (East and West coast), but they're both tasty. Instead of cocktail sauce, the provide a garlicy chive sauce, which pairs well with the oysters.  And they have $5 pints too, which is pretty dang good (not sure if it's just on Tues though).  We ordered the mediterranean flat bread, fish & chips, and grilled cheese. Pass on the flat bread - it was bland and boring. The fish was pretty good, and the grilled cheese w/ mushrooms was fantastic!! but the grilled cheese is super heavy and ultra greasy haha sooo if you're on a diet, then I'd forgo the grilled cheese.  This place has to do something about their fries. I think oil hadn't been changed for ages or something when we went. They looked so pathetic.  Anyway, great service at this place.  I'd come back for the oysters, beer, and the grilled cheese."}
