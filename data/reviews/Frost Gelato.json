{"text":"This little gem squeezed in between shopping stores in Gilbert is heavenly. The flavors are endless and I I love how they allow you to taste test the gelatos. My favorite is the sea salt caramel also the cinnamon apple pie. Even with this cool weather out there, I still crave a scoop of Frost. I wish they had a location in Mesa."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors and the employees are very friendly. They will give you free samples of everything. You have to wait in line for awhile but it's worth it. The salted Carmel is very good. They have chocolate flavors, fruit flavors, smoothies, coffee mixes, and pints of ice cream you can buy."}
{"text":"Seriously the best ice cream/gelato I have ever had. I like ice cream, frozen yogurt, gelato A LOT. I have tried a ton of places but Frost is the most amazing frozen treat I have ever had. I would give 10 stars if I could. Not to mention the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and extremely knowledgable. You can try as many samples as you want - and I have. Oh and its low calorie!!! Wahoo! I frequent Brio next door often for date night, but never get their deserts any more - we always head to Frost."}
{"text":"So I just held a contest in my head for my favorite dessert. It was a tough choice between St. Francis' Cheesecake in a Jar, Frost's gelato, and Province's Apple-Almond Wafer Stack. After an intense talent and speech competition, the gelato from Frost was declared the winner!  I've been to the store in Gilbert a handful of times. I'm always impressed that the service does not flounder when the line increases. What is the hurry when you're about to enjoy something wonderful? My personal faves are the mango sorbet, strawberry yogurt, and chocolate hazelnut crunch.   I took a few different flavors to be the dessert for a family dinner recently, and it was the talk of the meal! My mother is quite picky with desserts, but she gushed over the blackberry cabernet.  The employees are always friendly and engaging. The store has a shimmer about it,  like it has been freshly waxed and buffed by elves the night before. They allowed me to try several flavors before I made my decision. There is no \"omg this is going straight to my waist/hips\" anxiety like there is with ice cream. Frost's gelato is lighter and healthier without sacrificing on taste. It has flavor for days! I wish I could say that I knew Frost before it was cool, but it's too late, it already is."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It is a weekly visit for the spousal unit and myself. She gets a gelato and I have a shot of espresso."}
{"text":"I went with my friend to Frost last night. I've been to several gelato places before and I went to Italy a couple years ago and treated myself to gelato every day... so it's easy to say I'm a fan of gelato.  When we walked in, we were greeted right away. The super friendly gelato girl gave us the run down of questions: have we been to frost before, have we had gelato before, the perks of gelato over ice cream and getting samples is recommended.   They have more of a selection of flavors than any gelato store I've been to. Each flavor is decorated to make them even more appetizing. The gelato girl gave great recommendations and we settled on the tiramisu and salted caramel. They were both amazing.   The price is a little steep but for a treat once in a while, it is totally worth it. Also, with gelato a little goes a long way. That is why they give you the baby spoons with your cup.   The decor is very modern and the shop looks spotless. The owner put a lot of time and work into their shop and it shows. They even come about with cups of water to their customers. This was a nice little touch to show they care.  I will certainly be back with my boyfriend soon. It's a great location just outside the main strip of the mall."}
{"text":"O M G. Can you say heaven?? This was our first time here and boyyyyy was it yummy. I mixed the dark chocolate and peanut butter crunch which was delicious but I probably sampled about 20 different flavors and all are phenomenal. I think next time I might mix the dark chocolate with coconut or banana mmm. Definitely a good gelato spot!"}
{"text":"Good morning I am a customer from day one ..and everyone in your store that you have  hired, you've done a great job with the customer service that they provide.  I had a birthday dinner for my son last evening at Brio, walked over to your store to pick up my call In. Not sure, who took the order and hour before. But there's one particular person that stood out as I walked in to pick up my  call-in and her realizing that it wasn't there. She went over the call of duty to make me happy... I do spend a lot of money in your store... she didn't  know that and it really didn't matter..she just wanted to make sure that the customer in front of her was taken care of immediately . Of  what  they deserve.  Just want to make sure I get her name right and she's recognized for this great customer service that she provided.  I did ask somebody at the register what her name was. ... I think it was  ?Melissa. I hope I'm getting the name right ..  she needs to be recognized, and  for you, hiring the right person for your store. Great job!!!!?? Thank you Jan D  Gilbert resident"}
{"text":"Outstanding Gelato place!  We really enjoy it and find it as authentic and delicious as the gelato we first tasted & experienced in some of the wonderful Gelateria's of Italy. Love all their different flavors of Sorbet, too. Great staff & clean location. My favorites are the Espresso, Chai tea, Cardamom & Coconut in the gelato flavors. Limoncello, Tangelo, Passion fruit & Blackberry in the sorbets. Yum!"}
{"text":"One of the best customer service experiences I have ever had.  I was greeted by a young man in High School (Drew), this kid was the most personable engaging dudes I have met in a while.  The gelato was awesome and the price was great!  I got a large three flavored gelato for under $6. This place is legit they even offered to pack my to go bag with ice for the ride home!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area, you need to go to eat this gelato! They have a million different choices; all made by them. No matter what you get it will be delicious. Hands down the best frozen dessert we have eaten."}
{"text":"We use to live VERY close, and loved and endured the longer lines.  Longer lines because Yum!  So worth it.  We don't get there as often but top on our lists when we want a treat.  We'll drive because it's worth it.  So many flavors and so fresh tasting.  You won't want the dark chocolate  (ok you will but hoping to dissuade so it won't be all gone when I go)"}
{"text":"My first review was 4 stars NOW 1. The owner had my review removed citing I violated content guidelines. I find that a gutless move to address a concern I had as a customer. Let me see if Yelp removes this one.  I recognize that they are getting five-star reviews for a product that is fantastic. They will NOT get that from me because of two experiences I've had in their shop.   Yes they have really good gelato, dare I say amazing? But the owner (not an employee) needs better customer service skills. The owner yelled at one of my kids for touching the glass when pointing at the flavor they wanted. She had just had an employee clean the display. Sorry, ma'am it's an ice cream shop and your displays are at knee level for adults, eye level for kids. Get over it.   I removed the other part of my review which directly spoke about an employee.   What floors me is rather than the owner using Yelp to talk to me as a customer, they defensively had my review removed. If this one disappears, I will assume it's because FROST is a paid Yelp advertiser and they will bend over backwards for businesses that give them money."}
{"text":"Great customer service, delicious and unique. This place is amazing , not only is it the best quality gelato EVER, but they are clean, friendly and reasonable.  I had family come visit from California,  and being that we are regulars we wanted our family to try their deliciousness.  Well , it was close to their closing time, and 5 min before they closed , I called them and asked if they'd let us in a little past closing. Amazingly they waited about 5 min for us and our family got to try their Gelato.  They loved it and were very impressed with their service.  The owner is very humble and customer service oriented."}
{"text":"Bar none - BGE! Best Gelato Ever. A flavor for any palette. Try the blended drink. A bit more labor, but clearly a labor of love and worth the wait: especially if your hands are tied spooning gelato into your kids' mouths. Lol."}
{"text":"There really are no words for this, everyone has to try it once and you will always come back! Endless different flavors with a taste that can not be described, only experienced!"}
{"text":"Very good gelato, with many flavor options.  They also have sorbet and coffee, although we didn't try them.  The restaurant was clean and inviting.  I've had slightly better gelato in Europe, but I'm not aware of a better dessert in Gilbert.  A bit pricey, but the value is there.  I had a brief vision of opening my own franchise."}
{"text":"I always thought gelato was just gelato until I went to Frost. They have a ton of flavors, its always super busy but the line goes quick and you can try any flavor you want. My favorite is the sea salt caramel. Everyone that works there is very helpful and very nice which is actually rare at some of these types of places especially when there are teenagers working. Everyone is professional and friendly here. And the gelato itself is so good, I crave it. And from what I was told, gelato has less fat than ice cream so that's a bonus ;)"}
{"text":"The only downside to this place is that it's almost always busy, but that goes to show that it's one of the best Gelato spots on the east side. Even on the busiest night the staff is always super friendly. They have a ton of flavors to choose from and many are unique."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Frost I leave happy.  Not only do I never feel guilty about the delicious gelato I'm savoring, but every time I've been there they give away surprise freebies!  Last night as my husband and I were sharing our peanut butter crunch gelato at the counter, he said \"It smells amazing in here- like fresh waffles\".  A minute later the manager came over and handed us a fresh waffle cone.  FOR FREE!  She made our day.  Not only was it delicious but it made the gelato a million times more delicious.  Thank again Frost and Kristin (the manager).  We'll be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"We love Frost! The manager at the Gilbert location, Jonathan, suggested the Affogato - espresso poured over scoops of gelato - it was amazing! Frost never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The gelato was good, and so was the customer service. The only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because while an employee (very helpful and kind) was scooping my gelato, I believe she was a manager came over and just interrupted the conversation we were having. I love the taste but the lady with short black hair should be a little kinder to her customers."}
{"text":"Coming from Europe this does not taste like gelato. The texture is off and they keep it way too frozen in their bins. The lady serving had to dig for dark chocolate for few mintutes before she got a scoop... gelato should be creamy and smooth so you should get a scoop easily with a flat spatula (that's how they do it in Italy!) but the flavors are really good. So it's good ice cream but not quite the real italian gelato :) Oh also my scoop of hazelnut had 2 small pieces of foil in it ... not cool!"}
{"text":"Frost is by far my favorite dessert place. Every flavor I have ever tried was delicious. Of course I have my favorites like the Sea Salt Caramel and the Bellini! So good! There is usually a line and its usually out the door. It always goes very fast even though the employees behind the counter let you try as many flavors as you want. I love that they pass out cups of water while you are in line or sitting down enjoying your gelato. This place is always clean and well kept. A family favorite and we frequent Frost often."}
{"text":"I was given a gift card to this place and I like the gelato! The thing that truly made our experience though was the gentleman that helped us he was very friendly and let us try anything we wanted to before we decided. Good atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Frost is simply the best dessert choice you can make! My wife and I go here 3 or more times per week! I used to be a die-hard frozen-yogurt fan, but then I experienced the joy that is Frost gelato.   My top flavor choices: chocolate, cookie's and cream, peanut butter crunch! You seriously can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting my fiancé's family and we stopped here. It was so good! Definitely worth 5 stars. I got chocolate and mint chocolate chip but I really wish I would have gotten the sea salt caramel. I tasted it and it was delicious! We had a group of 8 and none of us were disappointed :) we will definitely be back next time!"}
{"text":"Best gelato in AZ!!!!!!! There is always a little wait, but the hype and wait for it is true because it is delicious! I have tried the dark chocolate, pistachio, and sea salt gelato all of which have been amazing!!! Plus they let you sample anything and never show frustration about you taking you time to pick and choose through there selection of dessert! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This place always crowded, you need wait by the line.  this Gelato is delicious , though you can choose with many samples as they give, dark chocolate is always my favorite gelato flavors.  you can come and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"HOT DIGGITY.... Wait should I say COLD DIGGITY!?! Ha ha ha  I was so excited when I walked in and found a VERY nice staff of Ladies looking to help a Gelato Newb! The ladies let me try MULTIPLE flavors of Gelato AND Sorbet!   Most of the time when you can sample at an establishment you get this vibe after 2 flavors that you need to hurry up... NOT HERE! They want you to be happy with what you purchase... at least thats was the vibe I got!   Whenever I try a new place I always ask \"Whats your Favorite or What do you Recommend\" & I got some FANTASTIC Recommendations!   My recommendation: Try, Try, Try before you buy!"}
{"text":"Best in town! The no sugar added flavors are indulgence without the guilt! They have a great bunch of people working there too (very friendly and extremely helpful)."}
{"text":"Amazing. I've been here about 4 times and each time it is heaven. The first time I went there was a crazy long line. We were rushed to pick a flavor and didn't get to sample much. The other times I have been I have been able to try many samples. All of the staff is super friendly and share lots of fun info about the flavors. The gelato is so delicious and creamy."}
{"text":"hands down the best gelato shop in az.  love gelato?  come here and experience the goodness."}
{"text":"I think I've been here 3 times already and just never got around to writing a review.  My wife found this place through Yelp, so we decided to give it a try.  The first time I had sea salt caramel and dark chocolate.  To this day that combo is still my favorite.  The other times I've visited I tried the mango, pineapple, and kiwi sorbets.  I loved all 3 of those as well especially the kiwi.  This is our family's go-to dessert spot whenever we feel like some gelato.  It's about 10 minutes away, so it's not from us at all."}
{"text":"Soo worth the wait when there is one!!!! Well deserved 5 star rating. Been coming here since they opened and have always had great customer service with my delicious gelato"}
{"text":"You have to try this place!  Once you do, you will definitely understand why.  They have a hug selection of flavors and some very unique things such as hot chocolate with gelato in it!  It also appears to be locally and family owned and I do whatever I can to support small business and the community.  Thanks Frost!"}
{"text":"Will be coming back almost every weekend now! loved it so much! Great family atmosphere,  many yummy flavors to choose from, you can mix and match different flavors to create some unique choices. For example I mixed the peanut butter crunch and the sea salt Carmel, tasted  like a  snickers bar!! Besides the yummy gelato, I really enjoyed the customer service, but the one person who deserves the most attention is the young gentleman named JONATHAN. Pretty sure that was his name, but he was so friendly, so patient, had a smile on his face the whole time.  Let me tell you, he had a lot of patience, because I sampled almost everything! Id give more than 5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream. The young lady coming around offering water was a very nice touch. Need to empty the trash can on the patio."}
{"text":"A gem in the desert!   I came here based on suggestions from the yelp community. I am not easily excited by food, but the coconut, mango, and roasted almond took me by surprise---in a pleasant way, of course.  They are distinctive in flavor, yet very agreeable to my taste bud. The service is outstanding; Kristy and her staffs are welcoming. The color scheme of the interior is cool---a great contrast to the scorching heat outside---and it made me forget that I was in the desert.  This place is definitely worth the trip. The navigation may not be up to date, but the place is located in the northeast corner of Williams Field and Santan, right behind Barnes and Noble."}
{"text":"I had the dark chocolate and raspberry! Amazing!!!! The customer service is top notch here too!"}
{"text":"I feel fine giving this place two stars. First, with the 30 minute wait to get to the front of the line, I was expecting the best gelato I've ever had! I was highly disappointed. The sea salt caramel tasted like it had no salt at all. The mint chocolate chip was chalky, and the straciatella was icy. Overall, the flavors I tried were bland. Second, they use very thin packaging, and so the gelato melts quickly. We took ours to go, and I was perfectly content leaving it in the freezer and pretending it didn't exist. Third, I've had a good amount of gelato in my life, and particularly in the last year. I went to Europe and had it in three countries, and frequently stop by the Gelato Spot in Phoenix. The Gelato Spot is substantially better than Frost. I recommend driving to the nearest Gelato Spot and passing Frost by. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, clean, cute, nice atmosphere, DELICIOUS, great for dates or a family night. BUT THE BEST PART is the staff. They are so friendly, knowledgeable about the product, they go above and beyond to make your experience a great one!!!!!!! And great music playing!"}
{"text":"First time here! I loved it! I just moved from Colorado and when I have people visit me in the future I'm going to bring them here for a treat."}
{"text":"There's always a line out the door but that is a good thing because the gelato is amazing! So many different flavors to pick from."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The entire staff is always friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The gelato - so many choices...My favorite is the seasalt caramel, and my daughters love the bubble gum flavor.  Truly a great place to stop, especially when it is hot outside!  The best around!"}
{"text":"If you have over 30 flavors, it is probably smart to have endless samples! So if you have a hard time making up your mind (like I do) this is the place to sample. :-)The staff is always smiling and friendly. Very knowledgeable about the product they are selling. Don't want gelato? Get sorbet instead. Mix and match flavors. The Rum Raisin, Carmello,coconut,  and some new flavor of the month are always my top picks. The flavors are always changing, and there are still quite a few I have not tried (yet). Bring some friends, and leave behind your guilt. This gelato is MUCH healthier than dairy queen or coldstone creamery's desserts."}
{"text":"Best gelato in the East Valley.  I look forward to each visit!  Way better than ice cream,  Our whole family is hooked."}
{"text":"To die for.  Really.  This is by far best gelato I've ever had.  It is DELISH!  And the flavors are awesome!  Most recently, I've had the blackberry cabernet and the spicy chocolate.  Sooo yummy.  The spicy chocolate was perfect - just chocolatey enough with a little kick.  The blackberry cabernet paired with it couldn't have been better.  I'm not a gelato expert, but I have had it before and I generally don't/can't eat a lot of this.  The density on this is perfect and I don't know...it was just like a party in your mount.  ;)  LOL.  The staff is friendly and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other flavors.  I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed if you give it a try!"}
{"text":"New favorite Gelato location.  I drive from Chandler to enjoy this experience.  Excellent selections and awesome customer service.  They even gave my dog a water bowl while we enjoyed our Gelato outside. Perfecto!"}
{"text":"It's the best in the US (that I've had). In Florence, Italy there's an astonishingly good place one bridge up from the Ponteveccio and in the Venice train station there's also a great place too. However, like I said it's the best in the States."}
{"text":"Every single flavor I've tried is delicious! The product is worth the line!"}
{"text":"Heaven in a cup with a little spoon! Amazingly delicious! The employees are great - so sweet and friendly and they never make you feel like you're in a rush even with a line out the door. They're gelato is made daily and is seriously the best gelato/ice cream I've ever had. They have a GREAT selection of flavors, so there is something for everyone. .Seriously love it here - and probably visit WAY too often (but trust me, it's worth it!)"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Can't get enough of Frost. It is always hard to decide on which flavor combination to get. Any choice you make you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I gave it 5 stars but it's a perfect 10! I have ignored this place since it opened although I am at Brio next door weekly. A co-worker gave me a gift certificate so went there after dinner and skipped Brio's rich desserts. Fell in love with the place after the first sample. The young staff is VERY patient and indulged me with all the samples I wanted. I now go every Saturday and get enough to take home for the week. I'm on a diet so I ration it out - it's my one indulgence but half the calories of ice cream.   On Saturday night there was a line out the door. The place is small so it gets a bit crowded but worth it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best dessert I've had. I think this is the only place in town that can try to compete with Churn in Phoenix. Customer service is awesome along with every flavor I've had. Lines a re usually long but worth the wait. Keep it up Frost!"}
{"text":"I love this place with all my heart. It's so delicious I can barely stand it. Not only is the shop cool, the service amazing, and the gelato not super calorie-laden; but the gelato here is just fantastic. And, if you come on your birthday, you get a free \"piccolo\" icecream."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have not been to a gelato shoppe as excellent as Frost. The range of interesting flavors with the classics is impressive. Plus the presentation is beautiful. And you can sample it all. Big samples too!    The service is impeccable. Super friendly. One of the ladies stopped cleaning to talk to me and my husband for 15 minutes about the products and the business. You can tell everyone enjoys working there. She even remembered what we both were eating 20 minutes after ordering. She was extremely knowledgable.   I WiLL be back"}
{"text":"Yummy gelato!! Friendly staff!! Open late!! What's not to love? Toasted Marshmallow and Chocolate is just like a S'more. Chocolates are all rich and creamy, but Panne cotta, Creme brulee, and Vanilla bean are my faves. Love Frost! Tip- call ahead for the mini-gelato tree (24 different flavors)."}
{"text":"We tried FROST fir the fist time on Friday. It is hard to figure out what you want when the line is right in front of the case, but the staff is friendly and willing to give samples to help you decide. I sampled the sea salt caramel and thought it was too sweet fir my liking. We got the pineapple sorbet, and it was fantastic! We went back the next day, and git a large cupwith three flavors: bubblegum, banana, and mint chocolate chip. The bubblegum is just what you'd expect, my 3 yr old lived it! Banana was fantastic, as well as the mint chocolate chip. I can't wait to go back and try the strawberry sorbet and orange sorbet!"}
{"text":"Lines are usually a bit long but the service is always great! The salted caramel gelato is delish (it's a must try!)"}
{"text":"BEST GELATO IN ARIZONA! They have so many good flavors and the quality is great! They even have a couple of dietetic flavors which are very tasty as well.   Give it a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"From the amazing service super friendly the staff knows the product and is proud to serve it.  Absolutely Deelish"}
{"text":"Best gelato ever! I'm not sure what I enjoyed more the gelato or the awesome employees. Made lots of yummy suggestions and let us try any flavor we wanted. We'll be going here again soon!"}
{"text":"My cousin took me here for my first time when I was visiting from Georgia. I have to say this way the BEST gelato I have ever had. The staff is very friendly about you trying as many flavors as you would like and they are very knowledgable of their products. I was even told that for the toasted marshmallow gelato that they toast a bunch of giant marshmallows to make it! My cousin had the toasted marshmallow and I had the coconut..of course we shared with each other and loved both equally.   I loved every sample I was given and it was very hard to make a choice. Awesome staff and even better gelatos!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Super friendly and they literally let me try 10 flavors.  Service was great too, they bring you water and are super friendly!  Check it out"}
{"text":"Best ever.  Salted carmel and toasted almond are my favorites.  What the store tells me 50% less fat than regular ice cream and 80% less calories than ice cream.  I'll check on that later, but for now I'm addicted to this gelato.  Their receipt and products are imported from Italy.  It's worth it to try just one scoop and then your hooked."}
{"text":"Exquisite taste. Not too much sugar content and a variety of flavors to choose from (I chose coconut and mint, my boyfriend chose toasted coconut and black cherry). It is in a busy plaza and it tends to be crowded. Customer service is exceptional."}
{"text":"We love this place. My family all loves the gelato and I love the sorbet. The flavors are delicious, which I can say from sampling each one, and the atmosphere is so inviting. The employees are so friendly and helpful. It is a hot spot but they bring out samples and water for everyone while they wait. The owners are always there and just as friendly as their employees. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really want to give Frost 4 stars just because they had great service and was so patient with us getting a million samples. But unfortunately I just didn't like the gelato...I tried at least 5 flavors and couldn't settle on any I liked too much so I stuck with the mango. However there was such an odd after taste after every bite, felt like milk/cream. I tried to ignore it but after a couple bites I couldn't handle the after taste anymore.  Since it got such rave reviews, maybe I should return and try more flavors... For now though please don't get the mango if you go."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST GELATO!! AND the servers are always super friendly AND the place is always uber clean AND they offer a free gelato on your birthday.  A+++.  Oh, and the Sea Salt Caramel is to die for. :) It just doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"This gelato is the best! They have every flavor you could think of and they are all so delicious. I remember the first time I came here and I felt like I was in Disneyland. I tried several different flavors but it was so hard to choose just one so I got two! This place is a dream and the gelato is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is the best gelato in the US..we were there in a Saturday evening, and the line was out the door! No worries though..it goes quickly, and is definitely worth the few minutes it takes to get your tasty treat. Don't miss this!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say but absolute perfection, from the gelato, atmosphere, service, even the little cookie they put on the gelato. I've had the salted caramel twice and it's wonderful, rich and creamy. But not as many calories as normal ice cream?? Hard to believe but I'll believe it eat more!  Expect to wait especially on a weekend evening after dinner. Yum!"}
{"text":"We hired Frost for our wedding and people LOVED it! It was one of the highlights of the night, that's for sure. Frost has always been one of our favorite places and we wanted to share that with everyone else. The service and price was excellent."}
{"text":"My family loves to go to Frost.   There are so many different flavors, and they all taste good.   They provide great customer service, and it's one of our favorite places to go!  Early Sunday afternoons seems like a good time to go when the lines are not too long."}
{"text":"Gelato is fantastic here. The flavor choices range from amazing chocolate to tropical delights!!! There is normally a long line but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and came back for more today! This stuff is deeeeelicious. I was shocked when I learned that this stuff is lower calorie and significantly lower in fat than ice cream. Its so rich and flavorful. It is on the pricier side but it is well worth it! The smallest size is definitely satisfying in itself. So far I have tried the dark chocolate (decadent) , pistachio (amazing) and mango (refreshing and creamy)! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love eating here.. like a nice piece of Tucson here in Gilbert! They give me extra cookies when I ask.. and alway such a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Frost!!  One of the owners, I believe her name is Christina always acknowledges us and takes time to talk!. Every staff member is pleasant and patient. The Pistachio Gelato is to die for and we buy it by the quart!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. We all go the bubble gum flavor. Wish I had a lifetime supply tub because now I'm stuck living 6 hours away."}
{"text":"In no way did they make me feel awkward about sampling all the flavors!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get gelato. All the flavors are all so good hard to pick just two. The price is good for the amount of gelato you get. I always look forward to coming and get my gelato fix."}
{"text":"The ratings on this place speak for itself. Definitely deserving of its 5 star rating. It is such a nice end to a meal,  or even just mid day snack! The only thing better then their gelato (sea salt caramel?!?!) is their service! The staff is practically shoving samples down your throat to the point you feel guilty for taking so many, \"Can I try the Tiramisu please? ... and the Limoncello? ... and the Chai Tea?\"  I don't tip places like this often, but always find myself placing a few dollars in the jar each visit."}
{"text":"Such as the great Santan Village Marketplace where Frost resides, this place is another neat place to bring out -of-town visitors. It looks modern, trendy, and clean on the inside. It's a fairly small place, but offers additional outdoor seating. The gelato is really good. My favorite and I think as in many others is the Salted Caramel gelato. It's creamy and has that nice taste mix  of sweet and salty. There are many other flavors as well. They have tasting spoons and it seems that anyone can sample an endless amount of gelato flavors (much to the annoyance of the people standing in line behind them.). The gelato displays are really creative with fruits, small coffee cups sticking out from the coffee gelato and other \"accoutrements\" depending on the flavors they are representing. It's a feast for the eyes as well as palettes. They also make milkshakes with the gelato. I've tried these too and they are great! The only negative thing is it is definitely over-priced, but again, it's trendy and you almost expect to pay a lot for a place like this."}
{"text":"My friends and I happened upon Frost Gelato by accident. From the moment we walked through the door, we were hooked. The staff is patient and friendly. The store is always clean and pristine. The music playing is always uplifting and popular. But most important: the gelato is to die for.   After day one, I could no longer eat normal ice cream without feeling disappointed that it wasn't gelato from Frost. The flavors are so spot-on and tasty that I couldn't help but try them all. Some of their seasonal flavors really hit the ball out of the park. Even their vanilla is a creamy delight that makes me want to go back for more. If you haven't tried this place out for yourself, you haven't truly lived and your tastebuds can't even fathom what they're missing.   They have delicious dietetic options and a large collection of dariy-free sorbets. Not to mention you can get them in drinks! Floats and shakes! It doesn't get any better than Frost Gelato."}
{"text":"Great gelato. The display is like art.. Refreshing and tasty. While at SanTan you must stop by."}
{"text":"Great anytime of the day month or year! Amazing flavor choices in sorbets and gelato. Had a nice tasting with the owner Kristen and recommend some amazingly delicious parings like dark chocolate and raspberry!"}
{"text":"Not only is the gelato amazing, but so is the service! Everyone was kind and the manager even let me try EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR!"}
{"text":"My first time to a gelato shoppe! The staff is VERY friendly and VERY customer service oriented. We have been 3 times in 2 weeks. They are very generous with how many samples you get also, with the kids also. This place ROCKS! My favorite is the Gel-latte (I think thats what its called)  Its like a milkshake but with fresh shots of espresso, no powders or ice used as fillers. Pure low fat gelato, milk and espresso! Its to die for!!! They do fundraisers also!"}
{"text":"A great place to go if you're in the mood for ice cream but want something a little different. The gelato here comes in a ton of different flavors, so there is definitely something for everyone. The staff is young but they're efficient, move the line quickly and always are upbeat & friendly. The place is always packed and there isn't always enough seating. An employee always walks around offering cups of water and extra napkins, which is really nice.   We ordered two ice cream (gelato?) cakes for my daughter's my daughter's birthday. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. Everyone loved it. The form online is kind of confusing so I went into the shop one morning. The staff was extremely helpful in making recommendations and filled out the form for me as I answered the questions. Highly recommend their cakes!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection and great flavors. Always busy and easy to get to if your already at San tan mall."}
{"text":"Best ice cream ever!  Not sure if this is ice cream...it's gelato.  Not quite sure what that means but they are proud if it and have a good reason to be.  Gianduia (chocolate with hazelnut) is as close to perfection as you can get.  Hands down the ONLY ice cream (gelato) place to go in the east valley."}
{"text":"SO good! There's a lot of hype about Frost & I have seen their catering cart at several events so we finally checked this place out. The line was out the door on a Wednesday night and there must have been 30+ flavors to choose from (I chose vanilla/coconut). Prices are super fair and staff was friendly and helpful. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an awesome treat! My partner and I stopped in on a nice Sunday afternoon after leaving a late lunch and shopping a bit. We've both never been to Frost Gelato so we were pretty excited.  The gentleman behind the counter was kind enough to let us sample any flavors we wanted with no hesitation.   We sampled the following: Pistachio, Amaretto, Green Tea, Nutella, Peanut Butter Crunch, Sea Salt Caramel, Roasted Almond, Honey and the Banana Sorbet. Yup, all those flavors :)  We decided to go with a Medium size to share and went with the Roasted Almond and Peanut Butter Crunch flavors.  We LOVED IT!    While sitting outside enjoying our gelato, the staff came outside about 2 or 3 times to offer the patrons cups of water.  That was really nice!  Next time we'll order something different and we will NOT be sharing :)"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Sea salt Carmel makes me salivate just thinking about it. Typically there are long lines Friday and Saturday night so make sure you plan on that. Unlimited tasting. I wish I could have this every day but I would be as big as my house. It's soooo good!"}
{"text":"Best Gelato in Arizona. There is a reason why the line is always out the door. We go back as often as possible."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than a star. It may be good gelato but there's this one manger that works there that is a total b. She's middle-aged, on the heavier side, and blonde. She was rude and very unwelcoming. On top of that, whenever people would go in, she would head to the back as to not have to deal with anyone. I have looked at some of the other reviews and the people who gave this place one star always had to say something bad about this manager. Unless Frost fires her, we will not be going back. We'll stick to cold stone thank you."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend while we were shopping in the area and we loved it! Everyone was very friendly, the place looked very clean, and they have so many different flavors to try! We loved it so much and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! We don't even think about going to any other gelato shop. There are so many amazing flavors are they are not stingy with the samples.  The salted Carmel is a must!!!  Lastly- the staff here is nice. The only reason I mention it is that there are many ice cream or yogurt shops  and most of the time the staff is poorly trained or just not friendly. At Frost they always smile and treat you like a person!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Flavors are all great and it is a healthier alternative to most other ice creams and even other gelato. I personally love the dietetic chocolate and peanut butter flavors. Only sweetened with natural sugar in the lactose!   It is generally a busy spot, so be prepared to wait.  It is well worth it though :)"}
{"text":"Yum!! Rich flavor! Salted Carmel was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Frost Gelato first caught my attention with their signage about being voted Phoenix's best dessert spot for two years in a row! After tasting their creamy concoctions, I have to agree that their gelato is pretty dang good. Great creamy consistency without any icy bits, and each featured flavor I sampled packed a punch.  Their Sea Salt Caramel is their best flavor, outselling all others at a rate of 5 to 1, and it was ultimately what I decided to get. I just rides the edge of being too sweet, with the salinity there to balance it out. I'm not much into sugar and couldn't even finish a small, but it was so good! Other flavors I enjoyed were their chocolate/hazelnut (like Nutella but not as rich), peanut butter chip (another best seller!), and coconut."}
{"text":"GREAT GELATO!! If you do not know anything about Gelato you need to check this place out!! It is some of the best Gelato/ ice cream/ frozen yogurt i have had in a long time! If you go on the Weekend Night you are going to have to wait in line! Last time i went it the line was out the door! We waited for 15 minutes, Well worth the wait! Do not be turned off by the line! You will be happy you waited!"}
{"text":"MY VERY FAVORITE dessert in the valley! Every flavor is delicious. The workers are always so friendly and helpful. The gelato is incredibly creamy and flavorful. The price is fair. The store is always clean and well-kept. I can't say enough good things about this place!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Frost randomly on the hot summer day while I was in the area. By coincidence, it was exactly what I was looking for on a above 100 degree day. I've never heard of Frost and as I entered I was so impressed by all of the different flavors with its decorative displays. The staff were all very friendly allowing me to have as many samples as I wanted. This is really nice considering I was having an overload of options.   I was delighted with the smore's and the green tea. As I took my first scoop, the delicious creaminess was so good, it tickled my palate! I've had gelato in Argentina and found this to be just as good if not better! Will definitely be bringing my friends here for nice icy treat in the future!"}
{"text":"How can you not give this place 5 stars?!  It is the best Gelato I have ever had, hands down! And there are plenty of places to go try in the Phoenix area... But if you're testing out yogurts & gelato shops, don't waste time anywhere else!  UHM and Helloooooo HOT CHOCOLATE!!  When it is in season (during cool weather) it is the best I've had... In my life!  Even the hubby who doesn't care for cocoa, drank half of mine! Thick, but smooth, not overbearing on sweetness, but made with gelato delicious! Oh, they also have Sorbet & this month features Margarita Sorbet... Hello! It didn't take us long for our little family of 5 to say farewell to Coldstone & their prices!"}
{"text":"This gelato is a MUST HAVE. Salted Carmel and mint chocolate chip is my favorite. So refreshing and light. I always get the two flavors in a medium sized up. Don't let the line to get in fool you! These employees work fast and efficiently with a smile the whole way."}
{"text":"Yep!!  Another great frozen dessert place that I can go to on my travels.   This was excellent.  Very rich flavor so a smaller amount was sufficient.  Be prepared to stand in line for a period of time.  They allow sampling so everyone has to try samples which takes more time.  Well worth the wait.  Pricing very comparable to frozen yogurt places."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Frost and I was really impressed.  First off, it was Sat night, so the place was hoppin' and crowded.  None the less, the line moved really fast and the staff offering samples/tastings of everything were helpful and nice (usually, some places are stingy with samples, but here they weren't).  We chose the coconut and espresso and couldn't help but moan with every spoonful - so impressive!  They also had a young guy offering small glasses of water (to wash down the gelato) to patrons - nice touch!  The place is obviously popular and for a good reason - it's damn good Gelato!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!!  Always a long line for good reason and worth the wait!  Goes faster than it looks because they are efficient yet don't rush you. Kristin, the owner, is so nice and always helpful!"}
{"text":"Good?  Yes, but not something that blew me away worthy of a 5 star review.  My preference for dessert is more geared toward refined and well balanced flavors.  I found that many of the Gelato flavors here hit me over the head and were too sweet or intensely flavored to have more than a few bites.  I tried three including the salted caramel which was way too sweet.  The espresso chip was a bit better but none in our party of three was able to finish a medium due to the richness.  I understand everyone has their own likes and many may love super rich flavors but after waiting on line for 15min to get some, I was not very impressed.   It is very clean inside and well decorated and there is some nice seating outside which is cool.  Unfortunately the flava-hamma was just too much for me.  :)"}
{"text":"I have found that most of the gelato shoppes opening up around the valley aren't really gelato. This is the real thing! The only place I have had better gelato was in Amalfi, Italy! Great service, they are happy to let you try before you buy, really good portion sizes, and great selection. Beautiful displays. I also like that they have charts showing how much less calories/fat that gelato has then regular ice cream."}
{"text":"A bunch of my favorite Sun Devils and I tried this yummy gelato immediately after opting out of dessert at Brio next door.  That turned out to be the best decision of the week!  The line-out-the-door is justified (there are about 37 favors to try before committing), but made palatable by the mini sample cups the delightful employees distribute while you wait.  We tried salted caramel and mint chocolate chip while waiting to approach the counter.  Both were magnificent!  Everything we sampled was delicious but we all found favorites:  Dark chocolate, coconut, crunchy peanut butter, marbled black cherry, Amaretto, and espresso.  All were rich, creamy, delicious and fresh.  Please support this Tucson family-owned and operated business.  The welcoming atmosphere and fabulous gelato make a winning combination--even if there really is \"red and blue in every bite\".  :)"}
{"text":"Across the nation our favorite gelato spot. The service is welcoming and cheerful offering you any sample of their beautifully displayed gelatos. One of the owners, kristen, is our favorite along with regular worker, marissa. Go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Frost is a fun spot to have close by! Located in the San Tan Village Mall, it is a quick jaunt from our house in Gilbert.   The shop is bright and clean and the gelato has been delicious every time. The staff are obviously trained to be outgoing and friendly, which shows.   I love that they have some great no-sugar added options like Banana and Peanut Butter, which makes for a guilt-free treat for my one year old :) I do wish that they offered a children's size option as my son never finishes even the smallest size and I hate to waste it.   They are almost always busy with a bit of a line, and their flavors change regularly. Herein lies one problem: their line runs in front of the display case for all of the gelatos, and the employees are stationed to help you as soon as you reach the beginning of the case. There is no way to see all of the flavors prior to an employee asking you what you would like, so its sometimes a bit stressful as a customer because you feel like you're behind the curve when you reach the counter.   We had a not-so-great encounter on a busy night with one male employee who seemed very annoyed with us that we were not ready to order when he asked us, and kept asking us if we \"wanted anything else\" while we were still deciding.   I think that this could be corrected by adjusting how the line is set up and/or by providing current lists of the flavor options either posted in an easily visible place at the start of the line or printed copies of the current flavors that guests can review while waiting in line. (they do offer a list of flavors, however it is a generic list that includes seasonal flavors that aren't always available, so this is frustrating because it is easy to pick out a flavor only to find out that it isn't available once you reach the front of the line)   Outside of those snags, it is really a great place and we enjoy going there regularly."}
{"text":"Such a fun and delicious frozen dessert! I love gelato!   The employee's are all friendly and happy to let you taste any of there delicious flavors. Personal fav's are the hazelnut, salted carmel and tangelo (which tasted like a tart orange creamsicle.)   MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Great gelato is to be had here. They even had non- dairy options for my wife. I personally love chocolate and there are too many flavors for me to try. The best part is they let you sample everything you desire. The three scoop option is the best priced for my tastes. It's one of the best desserts in San Tan Mall"}
{"text":"THE best gelato shop in town! My all time favorite is the mango with chili but that's a seasonal flavor! I also really like the raspberry mixed with the mango, sweet and tangy just the way I like it!  You can sample as many as you want and the employees are very friendly and patient with you.  It gets packed during the weekend so beware of a very long line especially in the evenings!   If it's your birthday, you receive a small cup of gelato! Highly recommend this for anyone who's craving something cold and delicious!"}
{"text":"Frost won my heart!! I was visiting my mom in Chandler and got a craving for some gelato. I did a Yelp search, and Frost popped up. I told mom,we put my kids in the car, and rolled out. It is located in the middle of a really cute outdoor shopping center, I'm not from there, so I don't remember what it is called, but anyway.....There was a line out the door...good sign...but it moved quickly.. even better sign. They even had someone going around giving out samples while we waited! Yes!! So, me, mom, and my 10 y.o. each got 2 flavors. I think I got Amaretto and Cherry.. this was last August..lol. But anyway, gelato was great! So good, my 10 year old wants to go to the Frost in OC. So if you are in the area, check them out. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Best Gelato in the valley. I love the blended Gelatte (coffee latte and Gelato). A must try."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  Great selection of AUTHENTIC Gelato!  Wonderful flavors, including seasonal selections that change frequently. The Sea Salted Caramel and Dark Chocolate are beyond delicious!  An Arizona company (based in Tucson) with local franchise owners. These people CARE about quality and their customers.... probably one of the reasons they won \"Best Of Phoenix\"  We no longer go anywhere else in the phoenix metro area for Gelato"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the long line was about. It then became one of my favorite gelato shop here in AZ. Unlimited tries for gelato flavors and they serve a cup of water to lighten up that sweetness.  Get the medium size which will give you two flavors of your choice with a good price of $5. I love the Pistachio and the Sea Salt Caramel, which I would always get, as much as I would say I'd try another flavor..eh I never do. :p"}
{"text":"The sea salt and caramel is to die for!! Yummy!! Even with the smallest size you get so much. And I love the little wafer on top"}
{"text":"Great Treats!!! I've been to Italy many times and have eaten A LOT of gelato- this is exceptional.  The atmosphere is really nice, super clean and the staff is very friendly.  You should give them a try- you'll go back. I had the dark chocolate combined with the cherry. Too bad I have to leave tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've been to that have frozen desserts that taste JUST LIKE the flavors they are advertised to. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Great product, great customer service. Smiles and super helpful staff. Free tasting and free water offered every time. Love the coconut flavor among others. We have special ordered the Frost Bites also it's a super treat and you can get any flavor."}
{"text":"I live in Colorado and somehow had heard about this place, so of course I HAD to try it while I was in town visiting.  I was not disappointed, this place is awesome!  The gelato is delicious, but also, the place is cute, the presentation of the gelato is gorgeous and the employees were nice, helpful and provided great, friendly service.  If you will be anywhere close to this place, you need to stop here!"}
{"text":"We ordered ice cream cake and Jonathan was great.  Great options  But be ready to stand in line as they always so busy :-)"}
{"text":"Frost wasn't on my radar when I saw it appear at San Tan because I thought it would be like all the other chains at the mall. Ice Cream/gelato/froyo places are a dime a dozen around here, and there aren't many that are worth the caloric indulgence. Luckily, a fellow foodie coworker of mine raved about and mentioned a few flavors worth trying.  The gelato here is very good; it's even better than some of the places I've tried in Italy. I tried the pistachio and chocolate hazelnut. Next time I'm going for the coconut or amaretto. My husband got the recommended blackberry cabernet sorbet, and I was very impressed how strongly the wine flavor came through. I hope the Mormons know to avoid that one.  What I don't like about this place is it still does have that chain feel to it. The TV showcases Frost franchise opportunities. They offer way too many flavors for me to feel confident that they can excecute them all well (and really?! bubblegum gelato...gross!). It's not a good value either. They won't let you get two flavors with the small cup. My favorite place in Italy let you get 3, and it was cheaper.  I'll be back to Frost because the flavors are great, and it's so close to my house. I'll just have to become blind to some of the chain qualities they exhibit."}
{"text":"Frost never disappoints. This location is always clean, the staff is always very friendly, and the gelato is delicious.   The shakes are also delicious and they are very creamy. These are always my go to when I don't want gelato. They have tons of different gelato flavors and they also have various sorbet flavors as well.   They also offer free small cups of water and they also sell coffee. Catering is available and they make cakes for special occasions.   Come here if you have a sweet tooth! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Frost Gelato is quite the desert hot spot. (No pun intended) It is a beautiful building placed right in the center of town. Although, there are positives and negatives to being in the center of town, and it is also the reasoning behind my 4-star rating. The lines build up quick during highlight times of the day, and if the building were placed in a less booming area of town, I really think that Frost could benefit greatly. Overall, Frost is a delicious gelato bar that easliy outshines it's competition whilst remaining tasty and beautiful.                -Justin C, aspiring food critic"}
{"text":"I love this place. The gelato is amazing and the sherbet is even better.  On weekends, you can expect the line of customers to extend down the sidewalk for quite a ways, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Line was not bad on a saturday. It moved quickly. Read paper on counter to see all the flavors rather than walking and trying to look at all the overwhelming colors etc. way easier to see what they have and make a decision. $5 for a medium which gives you two flavors. It was a little too much for me to eat. Overall it tasted great and I would go back."}
{"text":"Great place with awesome dairy free flavors and is open late. I really loved how flavorful the gelato  tasted. Cool thing about some of the flavors are that they are infused with alcohol like champagne and vodka. I tried the Bellini which is peaches and champagne and lemoncello is lemonade and vodka! I could a whole tub of this! So good!!! I recommend this place if you're in the area and want to splurge. We each got the medium size and 2 scoops of our flavor choice and it came out to 11.00."}
{"text":"No wonder this place is rated top dessert in the entire valley! High quality gelato, an abundance of flavor options(and products beyond scoops of gelato) and great service. The line on a Thursday evening was very long and extended down the sidewalk. Clearly the most hoppin' place at the mall. It was well worth the wait and while we were in line a sweet staff member brought out a tray with cups of water.   They are liberal with their samples so don't be afraid to try as many as you wish. I tried the cookies and cream, mint chip and sea salt caramel. Since I only wanted a small, I could only choose one flavor (2 flavors for med. Cup). Next time, I need to try Nutella and get the mint chip. I went with the cookies and cream this time, which was awesome. Hubby really loved his sea salt caramel.   There is a bit of seating, both inside and out and not too cramped next to the line. Family-friendly and worth the price, which was less costly for us than a trip to the frozen yogurt shop. We will definitely be back...probably sooner than our waistlines would approve. :-)"}
{"text":"The go to ice cream (or gelatto) place for my wife and I. My wife has nut allergies and they do have some gelatto flavors with nuts in it, but they will go to the back where they keep the surplus ice cream to scoop my wife's flavor to make sure there is no possibility of cross contamination.  They have a variety of different gelatto flavors as well as sorbet.  I usually end up trying about 3-4 different flavors before making the difficult decision and settling in on one flavor"}
{"text":"Best Gelato EVER. The sea salt caramel is their specialty and to absolutely die for. I also love the black cherry. They have many flavors plus the presentation of the gelato is phenomenal. The employees are helpful and always offering samples of anything you want."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight to satisfy a late night gelato craving. First time here was phenomenal. Staff was extremely friendly, prices were fair, selection was wide and the atmosphere was very approachable and comfortable. A modern and sleek look you won't find anywhere else.   Well, the gelato was fantastic and all but the only reason why I can't give this place a five star review is for one reason and one reason only- the portion sizes. Typically, when I order ice cream or gelato, I go overboard and get sick so instead of ordering a large, I ordered a medium. Well, the medium was more of a small. I mean, it was really small and was frankly surprised by the sizes they have to offer. I understand gelato is expensive and a hot commodity but for $5, I was expecting at least a little bit more than what I got. It was delicious until it was gone in about 3 minutes. It literally didn't make it home (and we're two minutes down the road). It was just a cup of sadness when I pulled into the driveway.  Other than that, it was great. Increase your portions even just a LITTLE bit and you have yourself an award winning gelato shop. Five star shop, hands down if the value is squared away.  RECOMMENDATION: Roasted peanut and peanut butter crunch. Together, it makes a combination of flippin' heaven. It is absolutely incredible and you're really missing out."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit the Gilbert area, a stop at Frost Gelato is a must. Its tucked away in a outdoor mall, and during peak times you may have to wait in line along with other Frost fans. But the line moves fairly quickly and soon enough you'll be in.   1. Samples - One of the nice perks of this place is the free samples - the servers are genuinely happy to give you as much tasters as you want. And its definitely encouraged to try as much flavors as you can, in order to get the complete idea of what Frost has to offer.   2. Dem flavors - Easily the top flavor is Roasted Almond (subtle and creamy at once, so good), along with Pistachio and blackberry. But there's so many to choose from, it'd take multiple visits to try them all.  3. Protip - ask for a cup of water, the gelato can get a bit overwhelming at times.  Easily the best place in Gilbert for dessert!"}
{"text":"Okay the gelato here is absolutely tasty! One small cup ranges between 132-160 cal! Had the biscotti flavor -- yum!"}
{"text":"FREE small gelato on your birthday!!!!!! Just show your id. Amazing gelato! My favorite is pistachio! The Nutella is axing as well! Must try the affogatto next time!!! Best gelato in AZ!!"}
{"text":"Decently good gelato, variety of flavors, would definitely come back here again. Went here on a Saturday night with family and relatives. The place is definitely NOT great for big groups, and expect a line out the door if you go during busy times. They do have some outdoor seating. Cant remember what flavor I got but it was good. Id rank them higher than gelato spot for sure. They should open another place between biltmore and san tan."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great. Typically long lines, but usually worth the wait. Try the roasted marshmallow gelato, one of the best kept secrets they have."}
{"text":"Awesome new gelato shoppe!! It's so delicious that we have been here twice already in the same week...and were recognized by the staff already. They even remembered what we ordered the first time we went. Impressed! Very friendly, fun and helpful staff! They offered tons of samples and suggestions for mixing flavors to resemble candy bars, desserts, fruity drinks etc.  I tried out their chocolate hazelnut, tastes exactly like those Ferrero Rocher chocolates [Heaven]! We also tried their dark chocolate and coconut ~ put it in the same spoonful and you'll be in Almond Joy heaven - sans almond [with a lot less guilt] :) They even offer a glass of water while youre enjoying your gelato, really nice touch!"}
{"text":"Best thing I have ever tasted.  The salted caramel is delicious.  My fave is the marble raspberry... Happy camper for sure!!!"}
{"text":"After visiting Total Wine, which is also mind blowing, we were driving by and I saw the magic words \"gelato\". HIT the brakes! We needed to park, and I needed to indulge. It was our first time at this joint and I wasn't dissapointed.   We walked in and were greeted with smiles and pleasantries. The girl working asked if we have ever been there before and I replied 'no'. So we got the whole run down, from ingredients to chef (both imported from Italy), to how many samples we could have (unlimited!) I think I tried 8 different kinds before going with the Amaretto and the Almond.   Creamy, smooth, rich and totally worth stopping. The flavours were out of this world. I usually go for Pistachio, and yes it was delicious. It even had real pistachios! I needed to break out of my box though. My mom had the Pineapple and the Almond, also very good. Next time, I'm getting Strawberries and Champagne!   So thank you to FROST and Kristin, it really made my day on this trip to Mesa. Hopefully I'll see you again before I leave on Tuesday!  PS. Totally worth the money!"}
{"text":"The best gelato this side of Italy. Friendly staff that will graciously offer to let you sample as many flavors as you would like."}
{"text":"I have been here a lot and this literally has the best gelato I have ever tasted. The flavors are very good and they have a great variety of them. The place is very clean and pretty. Their products are very fresh and I highly recommend it to anyone who has not been here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love us some gelato and have had a difficult time finding a top notch spot since our favorite shop closed a year ago. We didn't know of the hype surrounding Frost when we passed by it the other night, but were excited to try something new. We ordered the toasted marshmallow, banana and peanut butter. All were excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest where good gelato is hard to come by. Every time I visit AZ I have to get gelato! Frost gelato is the second gelato store I have visited as I've frequented another gelato place in old town-Scottsdale. Frost gelato was clean, the service was quick (w/ long lines), the staff were friendly, and I loved the location as it was in a shopping, entertainment, and restaurant outlet. I would definitely revisit frost gelato in the future"}
{"text":"Frost is the first place I ever got gelato that I actually liked! I think one of the reasons that this location is so popular is because it's a storefront that opens up to the outdoor mall. It's absolutely the best place to stop for something cool and delicious on a hot Arizona day. They have a huge variety of flavors and although the line is often out the door, the service is pretty quick and the staff is friendly. My personal favorite flavors are stracciatella and chocolate, which are amazing together. The gelato is cold and creamy and served with a little cookie to go with it. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great place! The Gelato is fresh and you can try all the different types! I am quite fond of the strawberry champagne myself! It is amazing!"}
{"text":"The best gelato around short of being in Spain - not as creamy and the selection seems to stay very regular vs. new flavored but still no better around."}
{"text":"Pretty good gelato shop with many flavors. They have a variety of classic flavors, like chocolate, pistachio, and cookies and cream, while they have seasonal flavors, such as cinnamon apple pie and pumpkin spice during the fall. If you are looking more for a fruit gelato, they have that too, from flavors like mango, raspberry and even pineapple. Diabetic or watching your sugar and wondering if they can accommodate? They have 2 flavors that do not have added sugar.  If gelato isn't your thing, don't fret. They also sell coffee and espressos. If you want a bit of both, they have specialty gelato shakes, with or without espresso. You have the option of a small to large, and have the chance to do a split scoop with the medium and large flavors. Feel free to sample different flavors if you can't decide. Additionally, they have some pre-packaged containers that you take home with you.  It is not a good place for large groups because there are few tables and seats. There is seating indoors and outdoors if you're lucky and want to chat for awhile."}
{"text":"So far, I have tried some certain flavors. Rum raisin, champagne and dark chocolate are two of my most favorite flavors. I really like that this place opens late until 10pm, so it would never be too late for me to drive 5mins away from my home to this place for a sweet cup before bed (yes, I do have sweet tooth). The portion is just great, and they surely let you know the calories you take in comparing to ice cream. Menu is easy to follow, and staff are patient while waiting for me to find out what I really want. And it usually gets pretty busy on Saturday night, so get in line and get ready for some of that yummy frost."}
{"text":"Very friendly, patient employees dealing with ridiculously long lines. They let you sample as much as you want Nd even bring samples and water to people waiting in line. The gelato flavors are robust and excellent. A fun stop post movie."}
{"text":"This place has the best Gelato I have ever had in my life, wide assortment of flavors, super fast service!!!! Wod definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love gelato and Frost never disappoints. With a large variety of flavors and the chance to sample before you order, you can't go wrong. So yummy."}
{"text":"In the middle of forsaken Gilbert there is a mall, and in that mall there is an amazing gelato shop.  Big line, bit of a wait, but very worth it on a semi-warm AZ day.  All kinds of super enhanced flavors, you just want to try them all and never stop eating.  The staff seems to get off on being super excited and friendly which is a fun enhancement.  The only disappointment was when I got to the cashier and they waited about 2 minutes fiddling about and cleaning things before they realized I was ready to purchase, even though I sat right in front of them staring in their eyes and waiting patiently.  They didn't apologize."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Their no sugar added chocolate is wonderful and I feel less guilty eating it.  Staff are friendly, they manage crowds well and when really busy they are out handing out water and visiting with people in line while moving folks through the process.     Their product is the best gelato I've found anywhere."}
{"text":"Finally a gelato shop that rivals THE Gelato Spot in Scottsdale. I went to the one in tucson years ago so its nice that they finally opened one up nearby.  Clean, cool, and fresh atmosphere. It's in a good location at the San Tan Village and is open late (well comparably late to everything else in Gilbert) til 10pm.  The service is friendly, samples galore, they bring you water and they KNOW their gelato. The service here tops that of the gelato spot.   As for the taste, it's pretty damn good. I really enjoy the stracciatella and hazelnut. Don't really care for the sea salt caramel or the amaretto. Either way, if you're in the area don't do dessert at any of the restaurants - come here instead. Great way to cool off with a treat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm not a big ice cream/gelato person but this stuff is to die for."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best gelato in the Valley!  So many delicious flavors of gelato and sorbet. Sugar free options as well. Friendly service.  Their shakes are the absolute best!  So worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and an extremely excited/friendly staff! I always get greeted the moment I walk through the door. The gelato hits the spot and they always have some new/fun flavor of the season. I loved the Guinness flavor and irish whiskey flavor for St. Patricks day."}
{"text":"The best Gelato ever...EVER!!!  Yeah I said it.  What?  Seriously, the best customer service I've experienced since the '70s.  By the time I ordered I was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything - easily 20 different favors to sample and choose from.  My favorites are the dark chocolate, salted caramel, peach champagne, and black cherry.  We've visited multiple times and have never been disappointed - same quality service and deliciousness every time.  My kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit - they appreciate their customers.  If your looking for your next vice, check this place out!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The people are always so friendly and the gelato is great. They have so many flavors to choose from. During the summer the line is usually out the door but the staff work fast so the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"I've had gelato here a few times before. I had a quick question about what flavors or new seasonal flavors they had available. I called him up and they had me stay on hold for a longer than five minutes ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it gets!! My in laws brought the hubby and I to this place to get an afternoon treat and boy where we in for a treat! Word on the street is that the line for this place normally wraps around the building, but when we arrived we were able to walk right in. The server allowed us to try different flavors before we made our selection. If you purchase a medium size you can get two flavors and if you choose a large you can choose 3 flavors. The medium size is more than enough to eat alone, but if your are big on sweets go for the large! All of the flavors I tasted were amazing!Once I tasted this place I had flash backs of when I used to live in Europe and had amazing gelato and ice cream there, this tasted so close to that! I wasn't able to finish my ice cream because my husband finished mine for me, but I really enjoyed what I tasted and would love to go back when I am back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If you hanging out at Santan Village Mall especially on a warm day there's nothing more refreshing than this gelato. My wife always expects that this is our dessert spot anytime we are anywhere close to having dinner near Santan mall. The ingredients are fresh, samples are free, employees are friendly and the gelato is delicious. Don't be surprise if you arrive in the evening and The line is crazy long but it's worth the time to hang out for the party in your mouth."}
{"text":"Best dessert place, hands down, that I have ever been too. The gelato is perfectly smooth and comes in an awesome variety of flavors. I come here every time I'm in Phoenix for baseball with my son. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Best in the valley for a reason. Helpful staff, they encourage you to taste it all if you want. Two thumbs way up from this fan!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! You won't want dessert anywhere else once you try Frost Gelato. Don't let the long lines scare you away. They do an amazing job of moving the line quickly without sacrificing customer service! Which, by the way, has been outstanding every time and we go quite often."}
{"text":"Love frost!!! I always get great service and the gelato is amazing. I love the seasonal flavors. You can try any of the flavors too."}
{"text":"I'm always at the San Tan mall and this shop is always busy. I have wanted to go in for the longest time but wasn't so sure. I went in tonight and got the sea salt Carmel. A must the best! I was very happy with frost and will be coming back every time I'm in the area. Btw there's a ton of other flavor that also look amazing. You have to check it out."}
{"text":"We have been going to Frost since they first opened their doors. They are by far my family's favorite gelato shop. We recently returned from Italy and tried many gelato shops. I have yet to find one that can compete with Frost.   The service is excellent as well. They are all very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening and waited in line for about 10 minutes and it was every bit worth the wait!! Wide selection for everyone and they even let sample before buying. The only tough thing is there's not a lot of outdoor seating but it's more for eating while on the go."}
{"text":"I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson. Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost. Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue.   The San Tan village location is 25 minutes away but the drive is worthwhile. The staff is friendly, helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish. I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel. Truly delightful! Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area. I think Tempe would be a great choice! Hint hint...."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good. Constant line out the door anytime of the day, but SO worth the wait. Much less fat and calories than ice cream and a million times better."}
{"text":"Always fabulous! It doesn't matter what sort of crazy long line there is outside this place (And there almost always is one late into the night) it loves quickly and the staff is pleasant and efficient!   Everything I've tried is great and they serve realistic portions."}
{"text":"Delicious. I tried more than 10 flavors and I liked them all. I wound up deciding on 3 scoops from roasted almond, French Vanilla and Salted carmel mixed into a coffee drink.  The young lady, Jess, made it not only an enjoyable experience but educational as she told me how they made the different flavors and how the ingredients are flown in from Italy. I was very impressed.  Thanks for the delicious treat!"}
{"text":"Frost is a cute, tasty, trendy place to go for dessert. They have a great selection of gelato to choose from and they let you have as many samples as you need to find the right flavor for you. This place is so yummy that it's no wonder why there is always a line out the door. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Frost Gelato for a while. Every time I've visited San Tan, I noticed the line was out the door. This time, it wasn't so bad so I decided to try it. They had a huge variety of gelato flavors. Some were fruity, some cake like flavors, some with alcohol and the most important, some were dairy free. They encourage you to try the flavors and pick your favorite. My husband and I both decided to go fruity for the day. I ordered a mango scoop and he ordered lemon. Both were very delicious. I usually don't like lemon but decided to try a spoon from his and it was amazing!! Like eating a frozen bite of a delicious fresh lemonade.   They have indoor and outdoor seating areas. The inside was not so busy but the weather was great we wanted to sit outside. The seating area outside was absolutely full so we sat on the bench facing the store.   They came out a few minutes later with a tray full of water cups offering them to all their customers, a very nice gesture we thought!   Nice place with good quality gelato and excellent service. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is brilliant. I read that they were one of the top places in the USA to get our nation's favorite chilled treat... So of course, like any reputable connoiseur  would- I had to try it out to scrutinize the product... ;) The staff was super helpful and friendly. They have so many drool worthy flavors to choose from and you get unlimited samples! :) The hard part is settling on a flavor because they are all so delicious. My husband and I both opted for Mediums so we could try two flavors (well- four if we share)- I got Armaretto and Tiramasu and he got their famous Salted Caramel (and he doesn't even like caramel!) and Coffee (which is lucky decaf for those who need it to be). O...M...G...! The gelato was gorgeous. I think our favorite was the salted caramel. Yum. Fabulous prices. Famous gelato. I would recommend you give it a try. And we also have other flavors to check out as well. ;)"}
{"text":"My sister says \"You know, I wish there was a place where they serve ice cream and coffee, so we can all be happy!\"  Her wish is Frost's command.   Open until 11pm...YES!  Their gelato is sooooo delicious, rich and creamy and almost half the calorie of a regular ice cream!  There were so many to chose from, I missed the ones with liquor (limoncello, strawberries and champagne, etc.)  Gotta try that next time.  Tantalizing display case that the owner, Rowena, is very proud of.  You have to go and see it for yourself.  I got a medium size with two flavors of pistachio and hazelnut.  Darn, I forgot what my hubby got, but he really liked it.  He also ordered a cup of cappuccino that he raved about, too.  My little cutie pie had his gelato bubblegum fix. \"Mmmm...this is soooo good!\"  He put a generous spoonful in his little mouth.  I still don't get why he likes that flavor so much.   The rest of our group enjoyed theirs, as well.  We want to try the 23 flavors gelato mini cone tree next time.  The service was impeccable.  Rowena does an awesome job at managing her employees.  They were all very personable and helpful with sincere smiles.  She told us that she gives them a bonus and/or incentives when patrons commend on their job well done.  So make sure you let management know how they do!  It was a beautiful rainy summer night so a group of us stayed for a couple more hours chatting outside while the kids enjoyed getting soaked .  The girls came out and offered us cold water.  They never made us feel like we've overstayed our welcome.    We have a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Still bomb! Additional flavors I enjoy are strachiatella (sp?) & biscotti de creme aka chocolate chip & cookies and cream.   If you enjoy mint & chip, you'll like theirs. It reminds me of a York peppermint pattie. Pretty legit.  But still - my all time favorite is the toasted almond!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and the gelato was amazing and the service was beyond extraordinary. They have a friendly staff that is ready to help and spread good vibes, they put me in a great mood for the rest of my day. We'll definitely be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Love this location! I talked with the owner's daughter and she was so patient and nice and showed us some cool flavors we wouldn't normally try. This place is the real deal - their ingredients are fresh and their flavors may be amazing but the customer service is just as amazing. Always a line, so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"Our family loves FROST!  I personally don't like how much it costs for the 5 of us to go so for that reason we keep it a special treat.  The staff is so friendly and sweet.  Always a nice touch!  I'm somewhat addicted to the cheesecake gelato with strawberry sorbet either in a cup, cone or shake I can't seem to order anything different!!    Their flavors are authentic and surprisingly low in calories and fat!  Bonus for the waistline!!"}
{"text":"Sea salt carmel + peanut butter=heaven!  Love it"}
{"text":"This place is soo good! You can try any flavor, they are super patient, great prices, haven't found a flavor we didn't like chocolates, coffees, fruits, caramels, all good! Been here a thousand times and just found out they mix awesome milkshakes from multiple flavors!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! So many options. Makes you want to come back time after time to try all the flavours! Friendly staff. Little on the expensive side for dessert but the experience was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Have you ever felt your skin after you just shaved with a new razor AND Exfoliated? Yeah that's how smooth this gelato is."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, they have so many flavors! if you like gelato, they have the best I have tasted, my husband likes going here ALL the time. Everyone is always so friendly when we go, and we go a lot lol"}
{"text":"I have always been impressed with this place since day one.  The staff here are friendly and patient, always making the customers feel welcome. They're helpful with great suggestions and don't get annoyed when I sample almost every flavor (I have a very grievous case of indecisiveness).  Gelato is smooth and light, with very balanced flavors. My favorites are the dark chocolate, roasted almond, alpen caramel, and toasted marshmallow. Even the bubblegum one is divine. But whatever flavor you get, I've yet to try one that wouldn't be worth the price. With that being said it is a little pricier. Although the owner told us that all the ingredients come from Italy to help make it a more authentic experience, so the cost is understandable.  The shop is always clean, neat, and orderly. Even the bathrooms. That's a plus.  Store owner and managers are kind, and not over bearing trying to sell you everything on the menu like some restaurants. It's nice to be able to engage in real conversation without it seeming like an endless sales pitch.  If you're ever in the area, give this place a try! It does get incredibly busy on the weekend nights, with lines out the door. I suggest going during lunch time on a weekday to avoid having such a wait."}
{"text":"Not only good gelato but great service! I picked up a chocolate and then got some mini sized flavor to go! I wanted to surprise my boys after school for being so awesome. The packaged them up in little To go containers and with a carrier and spoons. They really took the time to do it right! In a world where service just seems optional they made it a must! Great employees!    However, I will attach a photo for your review!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place!  It's a great date night place to go. They make the best Gelato that I have had in America. We went to Italy recently and that has been the only place that I have had better Gelato."}
{"text":"Simply \"Frost\"'is a family owned company. It's a local favorite. They let you sample \"or try before you buy\" so you know you'll like what you order. Always friendly, always delicious. This is a place I bring visitors as no one has had a bad word to say about it. Just a few steps away from a playground for the kids (and a splash pad in warm months) it's a kid- friendly place. Be prepared for a line though on evenings and weekends. It's a great place that the locals frequent!!!"}
{"text":"To be fair, we came here right after eating a large meal so I wasn't as hungry.  There were busy and I felt rushed in trying and finding something to eat.  My server was very helpful in recommendations and helped me pick something that tasted very much like a Creme Brulle.  I would recommend getting something rather small after a meal unless you have lots of room, it was rather rich."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I'm so happy this place opened close to where I live!  They have such great flavors, rich taste, and just the right consistency.  I like to pick one flavor to try and then ask the servers which other flavor compliments my chosen flavor.  They know what's good!  All of the servers are really nice and helpful.  Unique to Frost: They bring you water.  Awesome!  Flavors to try: Sea Salt Caramel, Strawberries and Champagne, and Bellini"}
{"text":"My favorite gelato is at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy.  My second favorite is Frost. Do I really need to say anymore?"}
{"text":"Very large selection of flavors.  Plentiful tasting spoons.  Helpful and informative staff.  Tasty gellato.  Get a scoop just about every time I am at San Tan Village."}
{"text":"Stopped into Frost after the movies at San Tan Mall it's on Painted Sky Drive next to Brio, Wow what awesome gelato!  Cannot wait to go back.  Very cool place with a great vibe, the staff was so friendly and kind.  They even gave us waters because it was brutally hot out and I just really am happy to see a gelato shop at our mall.  We had espresso flavor, they explained to us that all ingredients are flown in from Italy and have fewer calories than regular ice cream, I don't even care about the calories I just want MORE - I hope they do well at San Tan and are around a long long time I really can't wait to try more flavors."}
{"text":"After a dinner date this was suggested for a treat...so glad it was! The line was long but it was a Saturday night. I can understand why now too. Every flavor we sampled was so good and no guess about what flavor they were. I ended up with the chocolate hazelnut & raspberry. We will be back! We loved the smiles and the cashier was so friendly! As a business owner ourselves a friendly personality goes along way!!"}
{"text":"We have been faithful customers for years! The line moves fast, so don't let it scare you away! So many amazing flavors to choose from.  The gelato is to die for.  We have so many favorites, whether your in the mood for fruity or chocolate you will be happy. I love the salted caramel, my husband is a chocolate or Nutella guy and my daughter will go from salted caramel to other delicious fruity choices.   The staff is always friendly, I love that when the line is long they offer you water and samples.  Always pay attention to their seasonal options, toasted marshmallow or s'more is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Frost! Excellent service!!! Excellent gelato! It will roll your eyes back in your head, it is that good!"}
{"text":"Fabulous friendly place with a product \"to die for\".  Every flavor fantastic.They even had a non dairy item. Will surely return and it's not close to me at all.  Too bad not more seating. *****"}
{"text":"Frost Gelato Shoppe in Gilbert, is the best. The atmosphere's is awesome  and so are the workers. 1st they treat you like family 2nd remember your name which is unique, 3rd always welcome you to try numerous flavors of Gelato. My lil boy wants to come for his bday lol =). It's like 2 starbucks and you can't get enough of it, haha. Thanks Doug,Ro and Kristen you all are Amazing! Great Job =)"}
{"text":"Why doesn't Frost have a 5 star rating?   It does in my book. Delicious, always a line out the door.  Awesome flavors,  Too many to count. Gelato, sorbet, milk/coffee shakes...COME DOWN"}
{"text":"Delicious! And the staff is super friendly, courteous, and helpful."}
{"text":"Best gelato in the East Valley.  All of the standards plus a few unique flavors such as the salted caramel.  The gelataio behind this place has a great pedigree and the East Valley should cherish his craftsmanship."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  The staff is friendly and are happy to share flavor samples with the patrons. We were outside eating our Gelato and one of the staff members brought complimentary water out to us.  I will definitely add Frost to my short list of food places to frequent."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, great gelato, fun place....love it. Met the owner and they were out serving guests - which was nice to see."}
{"text":"After more than a year and a half this remains my favorite gelato place, bar none.  Based on the lines I see here most of the time, I'm not alone!  To their credit, they manage to move the line pretty quickly while still giving very good service.  Probably my only complaint is that their orange gelato is \"seasonal\", and so you can't get it all the time.  Tonight it was gone (though they had \"spicy chocolate\", which really was spicy...burning the throat several seconds after swallowing).  So tonight I got the limoncello.  Good stuff!  They also have a gelato shake (which my daughter says is great), and a gelato cake (which I plan to try sometime!).  And on your birthday you get a free small (piccolo).  Which is pretty cool.  I just keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Well Sir, this be a good place. You would think Gelato is Gelato and for most places that is the case. Here at Frost it seems they truly take the Gelato world by the horn and do their best to give you loads of amazing (and some not so amazing) different flavors. I am particular when it comes to my cold goodnesses of sin and Frost hits the craving on its head. The little chocolate sticks they place in the gelato add some needed crunch for the creamy goodness. We will be going again for the 3rd time in the next week for my birthday."}
{"text":"The gelato here is always fresh and always tasty! I have never been to this place when there is not a long line and there is a reason for this. It is great! You can't go worng with this place."}
{"text":"The hype is justified.  The most robust blend of high quality mouth watering gelato and excellent customer service.  The smiley, friendly and knowledgable young woman who helped us was quick to hand us sample after sample all while tossing a bits of knowledge about each flavor.  I sampled the Pistachio which was incredibly rich. She noted it was the most costly to make of all the gelatos (but the price was not higher).  After about 5 samples I settled on half cheesecake half black cherry at her recommendation.  I nearly inhaled the entire medium cup in 30 Seconds.  I found myself trying to slow down so I don't choke or die of a brain freeze.  Do they put crack in this stuff?!?  My wife got the cookies n cream... Though it's called by some super fancy shmancy name there.  So good, best she's ever had.    They also come with these little wafer cylinder shaped things that taste just like a fresh cone.  There was a super friendly kid walking around giving out samples to those waiting in the long line.  He was also passing out iced waters and making quick chit chat.  While we're gorging on our delicious treats they are playing a video of how they make their stuff.  We saw the espresso and gelato thing they make and decided we are coming back tomorrow!  So much to try!    Ok I'll shut up now."}
{"text":"Gelato Fun!  Cool little place in the San Tan Mall area in Gilbert.  Friendly staff and tons of Gelato and sherbet flavors.  I got the large which means I got 3 flavors since one is just not enough when they are all good.  I got Toasted Marshmallow, Peanut Butter Crunch, and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut.  Frost Gelato first off is super flavorful, dense, silky, and smooth.  Every flavor they offer tastes exactly like the description to the T.  The cool thing about Gelato is that it is healthier/less calories than ice cream.  So, if you are looking for a cool dessert on a hot AZ night check out frost and get some guilt free dessert.    BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"I've never considered myself a connoisseur of gelato. I've had it once or twice and never been bowled over. until i had Frost gelato. It's a heavenly flavor explosion in my mouth. I combined 2 flavors into a delicious mixture that tasted like creme brulee. But sampling all the other flavors was just as great! they have such a wide selection and deciding was really the toughest part. Their Bellini and strawberries and champagne sorbet was also to die for. They were creamy and rich, but contain no dairy! How do they do that?! I recommend trying a frost bite while you're there as well. A small dollop of gelato surrounded by chocolate. What could be better? I'm so excited the Frost is open in the Valley, i just wish they had more locations than just Gilbert. It's a far drive for me, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"5 stars easy, the staff, the gelato all perfection.  We sampled most every flavor, as the owner was excited for us to try each one.  Expensive? Maybe, but I will pay for quality.  Don't miss the SeaSalt Caramel!"}
{"text":"Simply the Best!  I must say if you are into Gelato or want to try it even once this place cannot be missed.   The Kiwi is absolutely ridiculously WONDERFUL!  Salted caramel is great too!  the staff is outgoing and it is clean.   The only bummer is that it is so popular the line is out the door and onto the sidewalk most of the time!"}
{"text":"The gelato is out of this world, service is top notch, love that you can sample flavors without a cashier rolling their eyes at me... Super friendly staff. Peanut butter crunch is my fave!"}
{"text":"I don't get the smug reviews that only give this place 3 stars.  It's not that special? yeah right, this place will knock your socks off.  We recently moved to the valley about 2 years ago, we make sure to take family when they visit, here, and they're all impressed as well.  It is a little pricey but that's what happens when you have exceptional quality.  I like how you can have sample after sample, and the cups of water is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. They have a good variety of flavors, I like to get their version of strawberry when I go in. Ive only been in a couple times, but its been pretty clean and the staff has been friendly. Sometimes it can get a little busy on the weekends, but thats understandable as its pretty good gelato. Overall its a pretty good place."}
{"text":"Cool blue atmosphere and amazing gelato! The flavors were sooo great and so much variety you can't go wrong! I'll never want anything other than this. I live an hour away and make it a point to come down for a taste, yes it's that good!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times lately and find myself liking it more and more.  I wasn't a huge gelato fan (I prefer yogurt or traditional ice cream), but I think I'm a convert.  I like the healthier concept and the flavors and presentation are very gourmet.  One thing that stands out is how incredibly sweet (no pun intended) the employees are here.  It is genuine too, not like a \"this is my job so I have to be nice to you\" nice, but like a \"I really do love working here and I want you to love your experience\" kind of nice.  I would give 5-stars but I've yet to find a flavor that I just LOVE (despite sampling almost everything, they love to give you samples!).  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best, authentic gelato ever! This place is amazing! You will not be disappointed with any of the flavors. Salted Caramel is my fav, though. Staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Friends told me it was healthy, so of course I got the most fattening largest gelato grouping I could get.  It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"The head Chef lives in Italy half of the year, and the ice cream tastes healthier and creamier than most artificial places out there. I love the ingredients and the price point is great for the high quality. Love the espresso, a little bitter with the sweet balances it out and provides a great energy boost :)"}
{"text":"Be careful, the \"diatetic\" gelato is full of fructose (which is sugar), even though they claim it's just \"natural sugar from the cocoa.\" Cocoa doesn't have any natural sugar!  Very dangerous and misleading for diabetics  :("}
{"text":"Frost gelato is served too cold and packed too hard to be called a real gelato in Italy, however it is still very enjoyable.  Great friendly service and nice clean décor."}
{"text":"So expensive, but so so yummy. The staff is very friendly and will patiently let you sample  anything you want- and they mean it, unlike some places where if you ask to try more than two you get an exaggerated eye roll.   The dark chocolate- which incidentally is the \"healthiest\" option as it has no cream or other dairy products- is very rich and indulgent.   I've been to the location in Chandler, but the customer service is much better here so I will continue to make the drive when I get a craving."}
{"text":"I wish they had one closer to Mesa. I love their gelato here. I usually get their hazelnut or their toasted almond, which goes well together. They can get very busy during the weekends, often times the line is out the door but they are very accommodating and provide water and samples for people waiting. The price is on the high side but worth it!"}
{"text":"Keeping this one short & simple.  I'm not a huge dessert guy, but they have an excellent variety of flavors, and the service was top notch.  Due to the gelato addiction in our household, we will be back, probably within the week."}
{"text":"Dark Chocolate... oh my! Great friendly service 24/7.  My tip, call your order in advance, to bypass the long wait line. They make it and hold it in the refridg for quick easy pick up."}
{"text":"Whenever I make my way out to Arizona, a stop at Frost Gelato is a must. It has become a staple into the travel itinerary and for good reason.   I discovered Frost a couple of years ago when I was a student out at ASU and was immediately floored. Not only does Frost have some of the most unique flavors, they have the best tasting ones for sure. My go to options are typically strawberry & champagne, sea salt caramel, cheesecake, and/or the limonchello. Equally as impressive as their gelato is the staff. They are always tremendously nice and helpful, especially on days when you just can't decide on what you want. They don't judge you for wanting to try literally everything on the menu and provide useful pairing tips.   I highly recommend Frost to anyone who appreciates quality dessert (especially on a hot AZ day). The unique flavors and great staff make Frost one of the best gelato places in the valley.   TL;DR Pros - Lots of options - Very unique flavors - Super helpful staff  Cons - Not too many locations in PHX area"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato but, personally, I think fro-yo is much tastier and CHEAPER. Frost is always packed with people! The serving sizes look mighty small, but turn out to be more than enough! It's a great dessert for a mall day outing."}
{"text":"Expensive for the amount of gelato you get and wasn't that good. Service was good but is was really loud in there which makes it not relaxing. I won't be back I would rather take the drive to Mesa or even Tucson for better gelato with larger portions"}
{"text":"Very very good gelato!!!! My favorite place to get something sweet!!!! Workers there are friendly and professional. We go there every time we are at Suntan mall. Please open in more locations."}
{"text":"Fantastic gelato!  If only I could bring it home to Oregon!  Best I've ever had!  Variety of flavors is wonderful and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not much to say other than if you're new try and go when it's slow & take advantage of free samples. I'm not a fan of every flavor so if you're like me ordering without sampling could result in a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The reason that I give this place one star is because, it's not actual \"Gelato\" it doesn't have the nice smooth texture that Gelato is supposed to. They say that they import their ingredients from Italy, but there is no way, it's just plain ol' ice cream that I could go to coldstone for.. The flavors don't have that wow! factor that gelato should. I have definitely had better!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get delicious gelato! I could eat here everyday! The quality definitely outweighs the price.  I cannot even remember the prices because it was so good that I did not care (it was not expensive though). To be honest, I had never tried gelato before going here, but I know what good ice cream tastes like. They have a huge selection of gelato and all of the flavors taste great. You are allowed to sample everything before making a decision. I have never had a problem with the service, rather everyone has been very nice. The owners are very down to earth and friendly. My overall experience was wonderful. I will definitely come here again when I want amazing gelato. Oh! I suggest salted caramel if you have a hard time deciding."}
{"text":"I really do not understand the hype.   I mean, it is good....not great. Not worth standing in a line stretching down the sidewalk.   A lot of choices, and super friendly.   Just nothing special."}
{"text":"the Gelato is actually pretty good and they let you sample pretty much everything. staff are very nice and really helpful. peak hours have waiting lines out the door and down the sidewalk but it generally moves fast.  I'd say the downsides are that it is way pricey for what you get and the place is usually bursting with hipster-types."}
{"text":"Trip to Santan isn't complete without a stop at Frost.  The staff is always all smiles. With the variety of flavor sand seasonal items it's never boring.  We feel so much better stopping here than for ice cream somewhere else. If you've never tried gelato you need to here."}
{"text":"Damn good gelato.  the best I've ever had and its 1/3rd the fat of normal gelato...don't know how they do it, but it absolutely ROCKS!!!  Love this place and the staff is the absolute BEST and FRIENDLIEST.  the other restaurants nearby should send their wait staff over to Frost for lessons in Customer Service."}
{"text":"Kristen deserves two raises. She was very helpful she showed us amazing combinations and made our day we are going to come see her every night. It's great to see someone so passionate about gelato!!   - Emily"}
{"text":"Great place. Lines out the door all of the time. Best time to go is around dinner time.  Great seasonal flavors as well. Never a bad time or a bad flavor. They have won several awards and deserve every single one. Will always come back to this place over and over. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of gelato until I visited FROST.  I convinced many who thought they had gelato to try this place and they are loyal customers now.   My sister even drives 45 minutes from Phoenix to get some on a regular basis.  I think another Yelper turned me onto this place and they said it was the real deal.  I have not had ice cream since and the flavors are so wonderful.  It is almost like you are eating whatever the flavor is.  Apple pie, roasted almond, caramel, chai tea, tiramisu cappuccino, etc.  It takes you on a journey of flavor that will have you leaving behind anything else you have tried before.  They even have fruit flavored sorbets that are wonderful as well.  I've had the strawberries and champagne, peach, limoncello, and margarita.    On the weekends there is a bit of a line but it goes pretty quickly so do not let that deter you from trying it.  I plan my week around when and what kind of gelato.  Crazy...I know but it is crazy good."}
{"text":"whenever we're over by san tan village, we have to stop by this place.  excellent gelato. very clean place and good services."}
{"text":"Best gelato ever! I have not had a bad flavor yet. I even catered an event with their awesome gelato cart and have been getting compliments for weeks on the tasty treats and phenomenal staff. Thanks FROST!"}
{"text":"Screw ice cream, I'm converting to Gelato! Always was a huge fan of gelato but to be honest, I have been disappointed to many times here in the States by little shops trying to get it right. FROST however hit the nail on the head! This place packs a bunch of flavor into one amazing product! All of the flavors I've tried, and believe me there were a lot, where outstanding.  So if your in the area, swing in and try some flavors. Don't be shy, they say you can try all!"}
{"text":"What can I say that others haven't.  Great gelato, plain and simple.  Line wasn't too when we went but I've seen it out the door many a time.  Seems to go fast unless you have people in front of you wanting to sample every flavor."}
{"text":"Three weeks later and I'm still dreaming about their gelato.  I ordered their espresso gelato and was not disappointed. With three cases full of gelato, I almost had decision paralysis if not for the friendly staff giving me more than enough samples to try. They even have rotating seasonal flavors, so don't hesitate if you see something you want, because it might not be there!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato! Usually a line out the door at night but go during the middle of the day and you'll walk in and out! A must in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is so good, everyone is so friendly, they ask you if you would like a complimentary cup of water and unlimited gelato samples, it's always very clean, and the inside is cute. It's always busy too! I try and make it here at least once a week it's so good!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We have tried numerous flavors and everything has been great. The employees are always friendly and helpful. The small cup is one flavor and with the medium cup you can get two flavors. If you haven't been here I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Little pricey bit amazing flavors made fresh everyday.  I had lemon and raspberry loved it. My daughter hat dark chocolate and oreo, very rich and yummy.  Clean,  great service."}
{"text":"Generous samples. Delicious gelato. Outstanding customer service. Restrooms clean. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Gelato I have had ever. I have not been to Italy yet so once I go there this statement will probably be retracted but for now it sticks.  My wife and I tried the Pistachio and Roasted Almond flavors and loved both. The pistachio actually tastes like pistachios (instead of most Gelato places making it taste like almonds). They do have somewhat of a line most of the time but it's tolerable. I would say that the way the counter is setup does not really help customers as it only lets you see the flavors right about when you are expected to choose. I wish the counter setup was different.  Overall if you want delicious Gelato this place is the shop to hit up, just expect a line and some frustrated individuals behind you as they can't see all the gelato they'll have access to."}
{"text":"Everything was great!  Awesome selection including flavors I have only seen in italy.  Quick in/out and seating if you need it.  Plenty of tasting and great location.  A must visit in the desert sun"}
{"text":"A great place with great gelato. The staff where very nice and the feel of the place was very welcoming. Meany variety's of flavors even I suggest if your in the area or just walking around the shopping center stop by Frost Gelato Shoppe."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, line was out the door, but it moved fast. Absolutely delicious!! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yes, it really is excellent. This is high-quality gelato!  I went here with a friend who swore up and down that it was fantastic. When we showed up, the line was out the door to the curb, and I was still skeptical. When we got closer and saw all of the flavors, I became hopeful. And when I got my cup and started eating, I was happy. This is really good gelato.  I had the peanut butter crunch and salted caramel. The salted caramel was delicious, but the peanut butter crunch stole the show. This stuff is delicious! My friend had the dark chocolate (and when they say dark, they really mean dark!) and almond. Both of those flavors were delicious as well.  It's a little pricey for the amount, but high-quality gelato usually is.  I look forward to coming back and trying this place again--different flavors, of course."}
{"text":"First time in & I absolutely loved it! The employees were so kind and gladly let me try any flavor I wished! The peanut butter crunch was to die for! The price was so reasonable! I cannot say anything bad about this place, the cherry on top (pun intended) was the service!!! Everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy their job and were happy to serve me. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The best gelato/dessert in AZ, not too far away from our home. Love the Salted Carmel and the service is great. They are always happy to let our little boy sample ALOT before he decides.....someday...maybe...bubblegum. Haha. We  love it."}
{"text":"Oh wow! Delicious! So good!  Randomly took the kids last night for a treat and apparently we have awesome luck because this is some of the best gelato I've ever I had. I got the caramel macchiato and the kids got strawberry and bubble gum. Flavors are fresh, bold, and well-balanced. They even put a vanilla pirroette on top. So adorable and I just love it when a place pays attention to detail! Then an employee came around with a tray of water. Awesome! Customer service was really great.  The only downside is that the place was so packed (on a Thursday!) that I didn't get to sample anything because I felt so rushed. Maybe I'll come in on a weekday morning so I can take my time sampling! Also, this is a total Mormon hangout. I'm not bothered by that at all but just so people are aware."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Gelato for a moment: sweet, refreshing, delicious. Okay. And let's talk about Frost: sweet, refreshing, delicious, AND THEY CAN MAKE IT INTO A DRINK. I'm totally in.  The staff at Frost are always friendly and are always willing to offer up suggestions about which of the flavors are their favorites. The seasonal gelatos they have are always good and I love trying them all. My favorite will probably always be salted caramel, though. Because if you know me, you know I am a caramel junkie.   In a busy mall, like San Tan, you will find that going here on any night of the week at any time of the year, you will have a line for this sweet, refreshing, post-dinner treat. Well worth it for the awesome staff interaction as well as the gelato itself."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I went to Italy and got homemade fresh gelato last summer and this place hits home for me. The best place in Arizona to get gelato as close as the  homeland. There's always a line that goes outside the door so be aware of that but the wait is definitely worth it. I always get the coffee gelato and its simply delicious. Will always go here again and again. They definitely got me to be a regular here!!"}
{"text":"So delicious!, so pretty! so fun!   I keep fantasizing that they will open a shop closer to  L A   The gelato is always super fresh 'cause it sells so fast, its all made in-house with primo ingredients. and displayed with Italian flair.   Very friendly vibe as well....all the flavors are delicious ...my faves are: chocolate, coffee, coconut, salted caramel, and the sorbettos .. lemoncello, raspberry, mango...FABULOSO!!!"}
{"text":"I added this company as a treat at my daughters wedding, What a great idea! Everyone went crazy over the wonderful gelato. This company was such a pleasure to work with, The staff was so pleasant and accomidating! Thank you so much! YUM"}
{"text":"I didn't even know what Gelato was till I tried this place.   Wow, Delicious!"}
{"text":"The Gelato here is better than all others I have tried in this area.  Most notably, the texture of their Gelato is perfect, which most other places screw up.  Also, the flavors are full and delicious.   If you go during the day or before 5pm, there is rarely a line. But later in the evening you may end up waiting 20 to 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been back here 3 times since my original review, and I have to revise my original comparison to Italy. I must have been too enamored with Italy the first time around, I really do enjoy this place. I will be going back again!  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  They let you taste a whole lot of flavors until you decide what you want."}
{"text":"My most favorite dessert place EVER! Love every single flavor I've tried. Pistachio, PB, salted Carmel and so many more. I usually do the smallest cup that you can put two flavors in. My ONLY complaint is that they do not have more stores. This location is always busy on the weekends. Service is always good."}
{"text":"What a great way to cool off after a warm summer day! The line looks long but moves quickly. I loved my Limoncello and Bellini combination."}
{"text":"Oooohhh my goodness!! Where do I even start? The employees were so sweet and patiently let me try allllll the flavors! I ended up with the strawberries and champagne and coconut! I wish this was close to my house! What a sweet treat"}
{"text":"We went here after dinner and the smalls were the perfect size.  I had the strawberry champagne gelato and my husband had the cheesecake gelato and we both enjoyed ours.  The line was pretty long but they had enough staff that it moved quickly despite everyone wanting samples.  The only downside is it wasn't too cheap, about $9 for two smalls.  But good for a nice treat!"}
{"text":"Wow!! What fabulous flavors. I could see this becoming a constant go-to place since they are always introducing new flavors. Great service and fabulous gelato and sorbet!"}
{"text":"Best gelato I've ever had! There isn't a flavor  that I  didn't love and what a selection. The staff and owners are very friendly and always introducing you to new flavors. The espresso and milk shakes are yummy,too."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've ever been for anything sweet, my personal favorite is the hazelnut followed closely by the sea salt caramel. I fully recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love the gelato here but I hate the long lines. So if I see the line, I totally pass. But the gelato is super tasty and good. I am always pleased with Frost! Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here at least twice a month for about six months and tried a different gelato each time. None better! Every flavor has satisfied. Still have quite a few to go before I've worked through the menu. By-the-way, the Vanilla is \"Indy\" approved.  Expect a line and a relatively short wait on weekend evenings. However, the friendly, smiling, staff brings out water to guests that are waiting to place their order.  If you don't want to wait ... use Frost's \"concierge\" service. The details are on Frost's website. Understand that using the service while standing in line won't cut it. No cutting in line, LOL."}
{"text":"This place is to die for! You can try any flavor - they have soooo many! The staff will take some much time with you even though there's a huge line to make sure you have the best dessert. They are so friendly! The line moves quickly though, I promise! Go and I promise you will be so happy you did! We'll never go to another Gelato place again!"}
{"text":"I come here WAY too often. With amazing staples and fun, changing flavors, who could stay away? My phone thinks I work here. It keeps telling me, \"15 minutes to work.\"  They are really patient about people sampling flavors. While you can only get one flavor in the small cup, you can get 2 (1/2 and 1/2) in the medium.  The displays are beautiful! It looks as good as it tastes. And, the restrooms are nice and clean."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato. AMAZING. Just like it tastes in Italy! Rich, creamy, wide flavor variety too..."}
{"text":"I originally reviewed Frost's Biltmore location, which I've always spoken very highly of. And this spot, located in San Tan, is deserving of equal amounts of praise.  There's a handful of spots in Phoenix for good gelato. And one would assume that people would dismiss a mini-chain like Frost in favor of a locally owned establishment. But when you take into account their variety of flavors, high quality, and well-trained employees, you really can't help yourself, dammit!  One of the things I've noticed is that Frost employees will consistently provide an \"opinion\" about every flavor you inquire about. It's almost as if they're all pre-programmed to spout a comment for virtually any kind of flavor you might consider. This is in stark contrast to a place such as Baskin Robbins, for example, where employees are only there to scoop the ice cream. Nothing more and nothing less.  It's also obvious that the employees are well trained in the area of customer service, taking a page out of QuickTrip's playbook. Fake or not, people always respond well to friendliness.  As for flavors, you're bound to find something that works. I've been experimenting with their fruitier flavors recently, but the seasalt caramel or nutella always satisfy a craving for something sweet. My girlfriend is a big fan of their Lotus cookie, which is only available during certain times.   Hell, they even include gelato with booze, including a recent limited edition Cristal, which I deeply regret not trying in order to further enhance my \"rags to riches\" image. There's also strawberries and champagne, which I'm a big fan of, as well as limoncello, which is allegedly made with four shots of vodka.  What's interesting is that they didn't so much as bat an eye when my 19 year-old sister ordered one, which makes me wonder if you'd have to consume the entire tub in order to get so much as a buzz.  I do prefer the Biltmore location, which isn't quite as congested due to the mall catering to a slightly different demographic. But regardless of where you visit, the gelato is excellent and I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.  Eventually, when I'm feeling wild and reckless, I'll try one of their drinks to see if they're as good as their gelato.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"YUMMM!!!!  Pistachio & Toasted Almond are awesome !!! Long wait line but it goes pretty fast. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Freaking amazing!! Salted caramel is the best but I really loved everything I tried. The girls that work there are extremely helpful and friendly. I was so impressed at their customer service. They offered tons of samples and hints and even brought water outside to us. If you ask for the toppings in each carton of gelato, they happily add them to your cup. They truly added an entire chocolate covered banana to my husband's gelato. Love them! So much better than any local fro yo spots."}
{"text":"I must say that I will no longer visit this location for numerous reasons: 1. A blond women on the sales staff ( heavy set in a black polo) rudely interrupted a conversation I was having with a friend while waiting for my gelato, just to ask what my plans were for the day . I was so taken aback, that I had to have her repeat her request. 2. I placed my order with a young helper and even while I was still having a conversation with this employee, she interrupted the employee to ask me what I ate for lunch also this same women in the black polo continued to try to talk me into a larger portion with a different gelato selection. Why can't I just receive what I request. I did not ask for recommendations. 3. I also have a gluten allergy and on a separate occasion a cookie was accidentally placed in my gelato. When I pointed it out, I was asked if it was ok if it was just \"scooped\" out. The person who asked told me she was a manager and owner.....what customer service from an actual store owner?! Is this how they train their staff.......what if They serve an allergen to a child?"}
{"text":"I had a terrible customer experience where one of the girls were very rude. The flavor I got tasted like frozen Sweet'n'low with a touch of mint and i was so unpleased. I asked for a different flavor and she literally rolled her eyes. I wish I had enjoyed my experience there, but i most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love it here. Don't be intimidated by the line, as it moves quickly. It can be difficult to tell all of the flavor options are without getting in everyone else's way but the staff is very patient and you can sample anything. I love the way the staff will bring out water and samples of their other drinks while you enjoy your gelato."}
{"text":"Seriously Delicious.  The line is long, and that is because 1) the gelato is red letter, and 2) the service is above and beyond.  And then there is the price... seriously I am not from Pheonix but where I come from you don't get this quality for such a good price.  I loved this place and am only dissapointed there isn't one in Orange County.    Top Notch!"}
{"text":"So good!!! The dark chocolate is a favorite of mine. There's usually a long line but that's because people sample way too many flavors. Went there last week and the girl taking our to go order left our bag with gelato on the back counter behind her to melt. She assumed someone else was going to give it to me. So after a few minutes went by I brought it to the cashiers attention and she apologized profusely. This was probably just a one time incident. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is easily the best gelato place I've been to. They have some great flavors like toasted marshmallow which taste like a marshmallow straight from the camp fire. Also cookie butter and Guinness like the beer and Irish Cream. They taste just like the real thing. It's the most creamy gelato I've had. They let you try any flavor you like. They also have shakes that you can create. Place is always busy and sometimes there is a line but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm search of the best gelato in Phoenix , I was stared to this place by yelpers. The staff was super sweet, guy helping us was chatty and friendly. We had few samples - my favorite were hazelnut & rum raisins. I got the picollo size which is one scoop of hazelnut for $4. While we were enjoying the gelato, the staff came around twice with waters as well.  Happy camper here."}
{"text":"Excellent place to chill and eat something sweet...ice cream haha i mean gelato...four people people working....very efficient...we had three larges i got the sAlted carmel...someone got a shake and one got \"Hot Gelatte\" piccolo..."}
{"text":"Try a lot of samples. The sea salt caramel is their signature flavor and as I'm eating it while writing this I can fully agree."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure nothing else I could say would be anything no one else has said about this place. Family-owned. Creative, delicious flavors. Fantastic service every time. I see people get intimidated about the line that you find on weekends/evenings but I don't get it. It moves quickly, and they often come around with samples and water. Plus the owners work the line to chat with people.   Why on EARTH would you rather go eat the powdery crap at DQ or that other yogurt place at San Tan?   We've tried the shakes, the frost bites, the coffee blended drinks, and even that fun cone tree you can get ($20, and you get 24 small cones of whatever flavors you want.. so fun for kids and has become our birthday treat tradition). Never once had a flavor or experience that wasn't totally worth it. We find ourselves making excuses to go to the mall just to get gelato.   The fact that it's lighter feeling than ice cream and other gelato places makes it a treat that I don't feel is a huge splurge. Plus they make the flavors using REAL ingredients. No disgusting syrup for the cheesecake, that's real cream cheese. And the crunchy hazelnut chocolate goodness that they put in many of the flavors is to die for. I seriously don't even get the same flavor every time. It's all that good. Even the dietetic flavors (no sugar added but DO NOT contain artificial sweeteners) are always awesome.   If you haven't gone there, get there. You won't regret it.   My faves? Too many to name. Try the whole list."}
{"text":"We brought our 3 year old in after reading Olivia visits Venice. Friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST gelato I've ever had!! I especially love their Peanut Butter flavor~ I found myself coming here for 4 consecutive days at one point, haha (you can't blame me; it was 115F)! A small is more than enough for me, and it'll run you about $4 for the smallest cup, but it's soooooosoooo worth it!   All the flavors are unique! It's not your typical chocolate flavors or coffee flavors. They have flavors I can't even pronounce! I've tried other flavors and they are equally as amazing in taste and texture! There's one that tastes exactly like Ferrero Rocher's but in gelato form :D YUM. and their salty caramel is amazing as well! Their sorbets are supahhh refreshing, and they bring cups of water to you to quench your thirst! The servers are friendly, and they don't look at you all awful when you want to sample the whole first row before you settle down on a flavor, hehehe."}
{"text":"Obsessed. My boyfriend and I eat here roughly once a month. Not only is everything made with fresh ingredients but they're flown in from Italy. We refuse to eat at any other ice cream/ dessert place because of their wonderful friendliness, unlimited samples and wide progressive menu. My boyfriend always gets fruity flavored and I opt for richer gelato. I've only been disappointed once and that's because I didn't taste their raspberry Chardonnay before I ordered my cup. It was pretty sad hahah but that's not their fault. Anyone who combines gelato and wine is a genius."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in the States that I can have gelato at without it upsetting my stomach. With ingredients imported from Italy, this is by far the best Gelato I've ever had."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The way they gave individual attention to each of my boys was stellar! When I called saying that I couldn't find it they acted like they missed me the ENTIRE time! The manager is adorable!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any more delicious than Frost! I highly recommend the dark chocolate and sea salt caramel. And it's shockingly low in calories!"}
{"text":"I really do like this place. They offer many selections that are all low calorie compared to ice cream. They recently got rid of their Nutella ice cream (I hope they plan to bring it back) which was my favorite, but still many other options to choose from. I really love the Biscotti flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place but the line is always so long no matter when I go! AHHH! But, it does move pretty quickly. Some of the staff is great, others not so much, but I don't really care... I just go for the gelato! :)  Haven't tried the Gelattes yet but I'm sure they are amazing.  **Espresso Chip/Dark Chocolate is my favorite flavor combination."}
{"text":"Sea salt Carmel is amazing!!!  I love this place. The line is always out the door but dont let that turn you away. It is absolutly worth it. The service is always great and they let you test however many you want. Love love love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Forget the hype! Again I said forget the hype! This place is good, but if you have it in your head that this place is going to blow your socks off, then you already set yourself up for disappointment.  The wait is worth it.  The gelato here is GOOD! Try all the flavors because they'll let you! Then pick one you want and stick with one scoop. If you get more than one scoop, be prepared to be eating way too much sweet stuff in one sitting. I enjoy the Stracciatella, but they're always selling out of it so you have to get there early to get some of it! Also, get yourself a cup of water! You'll want to cleanse your palate inbetween so you can relive that fresh new flavor with each bite.  Need ice cream? No! Get Frost Gelato!"}
{"text":"Best. Gelato. EVER.  Seriously, you will not find a gelato shop better than Frost. It's family owned, and the owners are always at the shop. Everyone is extremely friendly and passionate about their job and their product. The gelato is just absolutely outstanding. The flavors are unique and everything is very fresh. The owner mentioned to me that each flavor is less than 24 hours old. That's amazing!  Frost also does a gelato cart for your special events. I'm dying to have them at my wedding reception!  Thank you for the delicious gelato and top notch customer service!"}
{"text":"Meh. What's all the hype about? Sure it was delicious but at what cost? Personally I think you can get a lot more for your money at the self serve places. There are lots of flavors to choose from. The staff was friendly. Also, what's up with all the flies. I literally saw 10 flies all over the walls. I don't know if it was just this particular night or what but it was weird. I've never seen something like that before. The gelato/ice cream was good but for the other reasons listed I won't go back."}
{"text":"This is very close to the Scottsdale civic center. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the sea salted Carmel while waiting for his concert to start. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for a quick treat, I got pistachio and she got bubblegum in a waffle cone. Both were great, but after a few bites Hailee decided she wanted something else. We went back through the line to get something else, and although I offered to pay for a second cone the person helping us (maybe the owner) insisted that it was on the house. Great gelato and excellent customer service, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband is an ice  ream fanatic but tonight I wanted something a little different.  Wow! What a nice surprise.  The service was great - the girls behind the  counter were more than helpful suggesting ftheir favs and popular choices while handing out samples of whatever you wanted to try.  We both got the medium which had two flavors. My choices were tiramisu and pistachio.  They were both great but the pistachio was by far my favorite.  My husband got bellini and black cherry.  Again both were great as well but he felt the black cherry could have had more cherries.  Overall however it was a nice experience.  In fact, a nice touch was they brought around a tray of cups of water to pass out to customers.  Something so small makes a huge difference. We will definitely be back again to try more flavors."}
{"text":"I grew up in SF having \"authentic\" gelato in North Beach (Italian town); but this is by far the best gelato I've tasted.  The smell of fresh made waffle cone fills the store.  To top it off they have a wide selection and friendly staff.  There's always two or more low sugar flavors to choose from and up to 31 other flavors.  Shop is also clean and nicely decorated.  Wish they would open up one in SF Bay Area.  The only downside is that there always seem to be a line in the summer.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The owners are absolutely wonderful, very friendly and love what they do! Every time we come here there is a line out the door, but it's worth the wait and they work very fast to make sure the line is constantly moving! There are a ton of different flavors to choose from..... you cant come here and not find anything you don't like! There is something for everyone!  Absolutely recommend the Sea Salt Carmel...... never tasted another flavor of gelato better than this!  Keep it up Frost!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location three times and have always had a positive experience.  The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and patient.  The gelato is awesome and the place has always been clean, which I particularly appreciate.  I also appreciate that they allow you to sample as many flavors as necessary to help you make your decision."}
{"text":"I took my family here while they were visiting after having them over for dinner! They absolutely loved it. They thought I was insane when they saw the line but it moves fast and Is definitely worth the wait! You can try as many as you'd like and everyone is super nice!"}
{"text":"We have been there twice and tried different flavors. First was vanilla bean and the second was Bellini. Both were refreshing and not too sweet which I like. Our little one enjoyed his gummy flavored gelato. My husband's black cherry was also delicious. The nice touch was to have a glass of water served with the gelato."}
{"text":"A scoop of heaven or in my case three.  The owner let me try sample after sample until I settled on pineapple sorbet and coconut gelato.  Delicious doesn't convey how good it was.  The fact that it was also low fat and healthier than ice cream didn't even factor in the equation.  Lastly the staff were friendly and knowledgeable, we look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 plus stars! We love this place, and want them in California! The service was great and the gelato is beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love how they don't mind if you ask for more than 2 or 3 samples because they know how to appreciate customer."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here staff is always friendly and the gelato is always great. My recommendation is to get the pistachio it's mine and my wife's favorite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The flavors are intense and rewarding the staff is patient an fast moving. The only negative is that so many people love this place, making for a long line any time of day .It is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"\"Rated best dessert in Arizona\". And yep they do not lie.  Don't even waste your time at any other Gelato spots as Frost is in a league of there own. Every flavor no matter which you choose is outstanding.   My favorite is the Salted Carmel.  If you have a sweet tooth this is definitely the spot to ca that craving."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a good review because it will contribute to the longer lines! I had heard about this place through the grapevine. My husband and I wanted to make a quick stop specifically for gelato. We drove past Frost and the line was out the door and almost to the corner! I mean I'm sure at least a 45 minute wait. I'm pretty impatient so my feelings were crushed that we weren't going to have gelato. My husband and I happened to be in the area the next day and so we thought we would drive by and see what the wait was like. The line was not nearly as bad so we decided to take a chance...I was excited to see the different flavor options. The staff was friendly as we were sampling a few because it was hard to decide. I had decided on the marshmallow flavor and it was sooo yummy! (I'm craving it now!) I can see now why there was a crazy long line for this amazing gelato! I recently moved here from chicago and miss my favorite gelato spot. I've also been to Italy and have had the real deal...so I'm a bit picky. I'm very excited to find Frost and can't wait to introduce this wonderful place to my friends and family when they visit us!"}
{"text":"Wow! Now I understand the 5 star rating! This place is fantastic! It's was girl's night, so my bestie and I came here for a sweet treat after eating a yummy dinner at Costa Vida. The line really wasn't long when we entered the shoppe but there were tons of people outside and inside enjoying their cold gelatos during this blistering Arizona heat wave. We were greeted by smiling faces who offered us samples; the gelato was so airy! I opted for the mint chocolate chip and my friend had the cheesecake. We paid, we picked a table, and then we were in gelato heaven. I've had gelato at other places but theirs is at an entirely different level. It's extremely light in your mouth, and so airy and creamy. Another plus is they have a staff member walking around offering cold water to guests. I love this! Other ice cream, yogurt, and gelato shops purposely only have bottled water so you have to purchase it. Frost seems to focus more on their service, your experience, and their wonderful gelato. It's funny, because when other Yelpers mention you will never want ice cream again, it's true!!"}
{"text":"I must say, this place is delicious! It is always clean and the staff is always friendly. I really like that they go above and beyond with the case display! They also give you a small free gelato on your birthday which is very generous and appreciated. I don't go as often as I would like because the line is always out the door when I'm in the vicinity. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I always get the sea salt caramel, but the dark chocolate is good if you want a really rich flavor. They give you a free small one on THE DAY of your birthday if you show ID :D"}
{"text":"This place is great! I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees. Best customer service. Also, the variety of favors is fantastic!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic end tons wonderful day! We haven't had gelato as tasty as this since leaving Italy. We should have known by the length of the line stretching out the door and along the sidewalk! Fortunately for us, the staff quickly served up those in line in front of us - and what looked like it could've been a 30-min wait was less than 10! Great, friendly service, and incredible gelato! Can't wait for a Frost Gelato to open up close to home for us!"}
{"text":"Frost was great. I like good customer service and they were very patient. Frost makes you feel like you are fancy and healthy with all the gelato propaganda.   There is always a line- even on a cold night. There are alot of flavors but you can try as many as you like. The hazelnut choco is very much like nutella. The fruit flavors are sweet and fresh. I also like that they give everyone a cookie in the icecream.   I would come here again. I can see why its popular."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Frost now for over a year. The quality is consistently perfect. The service is always fast and friendly even when there is a line out the door in the middle of 100 degrees. They always bring around water to everyone sitting and keep the tables clean as soon as someone gets up. They have seasonal flavors that are always fun to try as well as sorbets. My favorite is cheesecake with blackberry. Always really good. I also highly recommend the sea salt caramel, peach, and raspberry.   It is very hard to go to San Tan Village and not stop here so I do all the time! Best gelato place in AZ."}
{"text":"If you have to ask how I liked my visit to Frost was then you clearly haven't been there. Even when there is a line it's no big deal... they hand out samples and cups of water and most people are polite and the line moves quickly. The gelato is amazing presentation and taste. Great setting too. Why are you still reading this.....GO."}
{"text":"Wide variety of flavors from super sweet to decadent to fruity. Great value - great taste. The GOOGLE MAP attached to the addressed is hosed. The Frost Gelato Shoppe is actually in San Tan Village mall next to  Brio Tuscan Grille"}
{"text":"Fave gelato spot! Awesome variety of flavors, unlimited samples,nice workers, and solid location. The seating is limited but there are both indoor and outdoor options. It's located right in San Tan Mall so there's parking available too.  After a long tiring day of shopping, cool down with this treat!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny day.. in need of a cool down.  Though I'm not a big fan of ice cream I asked my boyfriends opinion for this review.  The workers were super friendly and we got to try a couple of flavors.  The salted caramel was said to be their most popular.. it was yummmm but might be a little overwhelming if I got an entire cup.  My boyfriend ended up getting the strawberry sherbet because it was a healthier alternative, fat free + milk free.  It was good to me the first few bites but then it just got really sweet, he felt the same way.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come to this place but I would stop by if I was shopping around in Santan"}
{"text":"First time in was last night. Surprisingly busy for@ 9:30 PM. Excellent, delicious gelato! Toasted marshmallow taste exactly like the campfire treat. Little rich for my liking, but really good. The Peach & Strawberry Champagne Sorbets were outstanding!! Perfect cool feel on the palate for any occasion & a great indulgence during those hot summer months too! Tried the Frost Bite ( ice creamed filled chocolate covered candy) peanut butter crunch. It was yummy! Staff was pleasant. Can't wait to try more flavors of what they offer. We will be back \"for sure\""}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the gelato here.  They have a variety of flavors and the customer service is great.  This place gets pretty busy so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"definitely some good eats . Looking for that special ice cream style treat Gelato it is . This place is very clean organized with some great service. Free samples as much as you want to try and im telling you its amazing the flavors... Everyone that went that day all enjoyed it the Salt Carmel , Toasted almond thw in house made waffle cones it all comes thru in the flavor and experience. when people give a 5 they definitely earned it and I don't give 5 that often .. try it at least once to know what everyone is saying .. We have been back !"}
{"text":"My quick summary:  Ice cream will never satisfy you again.  That's right.  Never.  I'm sorry to say that for most of my life I had bad taste, and didn't even know it.  I loved ice cream growing up.  Who didn't?  Well, after discovering Frost, I can't eat ice cream anymore.  Gelato has only been in my life a few years.  But now I know what I've been missing out on.  If you've never tried gelato, there are some major differences you need to be aware of.  First, ice cream is packed with air, so it's not as great a flavor compared to gelato.  Second, gelato is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH (like whole freaking bunches) creamier.  And third, it has way less calories and fat.    Frost is a truly unique experience.  The creators tried to be authentic as possible.  The majority of their ingredients and all of their equipment is imported from Italy.  Their master gelato chef?  He's from Italy too.  And you can tell.  The flavors are amazing.  They even have an extensive sorbet collection.  When you first walk in you're greeted by a display with dozens of flavors, all masterfully decorated to look like works of art (candied sugar, champagne corks and flavorful swirls, oh my).  A couple flavors even change monthly, to go with the season.  Oh peppermint, how I miss you.  I ended up taking like a gallon of that stuff home to gorge myself upon...  But that's another story.  The staff are extremely friendly and polite.  There will wait upon you while you sample flavor after flavor until you find the perfect one to purchase.  Their best selling flavor is sea salt caramel.  And you can pair it with almost any other flavor to make your second choice even better.  And if you're not a straight gelato fan & want to get ll kinds of inventive treats, they accommodate those wishes as well.  You can get a milk shake, gelato infused coffee beverage, etc.  And their milkshakes are insanely good.  My fiance & I like to share a large one (more flavor combos available).  The best thing we've ever had there is a banana, chocolate, peanut butter crunch and seas salt caramel shake.  They even sell gelato cakes and other yummy treats for special occasions.  So if you're looking for a truly life altering dessert or sweet snack...  Go to Frost.  They will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The people are friendly. And they have a rotation of flavors each month! They also seem to have different flavors depending on the weeks. That said I'm sad when they tease me with a flavor I enjoy only to come back and not find it again. But that's ok because they have tons of other delicious flavors to try!"}
{"text":"Been trying to get in this place for years but the line literally wraps around the buildings.  Finally got in and I now understand why the lines are so long.  The lemon gelato has just the right amount of tartness and a balanced texture that borders on the smoothness and flavors of European Ice Creams.  The strawberry has the right amount of sweetness and the same smooth, creamy texture.  I even saw other flavors I am interested in trying such as the salted caramel.  However, the customer service provided at Frost will definitely ensure that people like me will return.  If I say I am going to look for a specific person to help me with anything, that means his/her service was THAT good."}
{"text":"Great gelato and lots of flavors.  A perfect way to wrap up an evening at SanTan Village. Don't let the line out the door turn you away.  It's worth it and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Went in for a little gelato with a friend of mine and I was not disappointed! Frost has a very family friendly environment. Apparently it's a lovely place to take the kids. I saw at least 5 strollers while there. I was very satisfied with the wide selection of frosty treats. I opted for an old favorite: pistachio! Having lived in Italy for two years, I know a bit about gelato, and in my opinion this is the best gelato to be found in town. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I am so lucky to live close to Frost. Everything I've ordered there is delicious. My son loves the sea salt caramel, which is their most popular flavor. I get a different flavor every time I go in. This is so far beyond a typical ice cream scoop shop. I like getting an affogato (espresso poured over gelato) or sorbettini (fruit sorbet blended with Pellegrino)."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I have never had Gelato with as much flavor as any of the options that they serve at Frost. The staff seems cheerful and extremely helpful every single time I have gone in with recommendations and knowledge of all of their flavors, which is abundant. I usually stick with the salted caramel but with unlimited taste testing I have a hard time picking which one I want because they are all insanely delicious.   The line wraps around the block but moves quickly and is worth the wait for the crazy delicious Gelato goodness that is inside."}
{"text":"Love the convenience! Love the service! They come around with samples and bring you water. Everyone is so friendly too! They have a nice variety of flavors that continually change. Their hours are perfect too as there is not much (nothing actually) to do in Gilbert at 10pm."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!! From the enthusiastic and helpful staff to the wide array of delicious gelato flavors, Frost is always a welcomed treat."}
{"text":"A definite fan! I love the samples! Pinapple, mango, and mint & chip are my faves! The atmosphere is nice and they're open to giving many samples! It's a great sweet treat for the weekend!! I saw a sign that they were best gelato in the Phoenix area for this year ~ The place is clean and delicious! =]"}
{"text":"So happy Frost Gelato came to  the San Tan shopping center in Gilbert.  There are many flavors all arranged in a glass enclosure for easy selection.  My favorites are the marbled black cherry, banana, strawberry and salted caramel, but all are excellent.  They allow you to select three flavors in the large cup, so you can easily pick three and narrow down your favorites. Although, it seems to always have a line....the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know where I'll be hanging out when I'm back in Gilbert and bored to tears. This gelato place is my jam. I just had lunch but was craving something sweet again*. It was 57 degrees which meant it's cold to the locals so I thought this place would not be busy. Boy, was I wrong. The place was packed INSIDE but luckily no wait.   The young woman who greeted me gave me the rundown of the place: gelato and sorbet flavors as well their drink menu.They had a lot of options and was a little overwhelmed. I tried a few gelato samples - peanut butter, pumpkin, and mint chocolate chip. I already knew I would get the mint chocolate chip before I walked in, but you know, I just wanted some options. Since everyone thought it was \"too cold\" to eat gelato outside, all the outdoor tables and chairs were empty. Uh, it was such a nice sunny day out so why not sit outside. I wasn't the only one with the same idea. A woman and her dog (who didn't go inside) sat out there too. I loved my gelato but probably not as much as the dog. He devoured his own scoop much to my amusement.   *I filled my sweet cravings with gelato and a cupcake from Caketini (http://www.yelp.com/biz/caketini-gilbert#hrid:W-hsyk_4inhaeT6YtJcBhQ), also in the same mall. I am not ashamed."}
{"text":"The people at Frost may not tell you, but Angels make the gelato. What you are actually eating is Heaven. If you listen closely once you have finished eating there is a holy choir singing. It's true. I heard it once myself.   Worth the hype, the price and the wait. Expect to wait 20-30 minutes in the late afternoon. The staff try their best to give quality service with such long lines. Just be patient and you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Wonderful! I'm not from Phoenix so when myself and two friends walked into Frost out of curiosity, we had an employee of the name Nicole come right up and welcome us. Well we were just looking at what was there, and she grabbed some sample spoons and had us taste the salted caramel. DELICIOUS! She gave me recommendations to what would go good with what, she had conversations with us. She was just wonderful! The gelato was wonderful! She knew all this information on the company.  And she was quick. Amazing service! We spoke to the manager that was there and even she was great. The other lady (I didn't catch her name) I was watching her with the other customers and she was as well. I love this place and wish I lived near by. OR that there was another one in LA. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato!  I always get the dark chocolate and almond.  The service is wonderful and the staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"This place has the best gelato I've had! It's also clean and has crisp wintery decor. Every flavor I've tried (unlimited samples!) has made it all the more difficult to decide what I want versus thinking what I thought I wanted before walking in. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable about the ingredients that go into the massive variety of gelato they serve. Each flavor has a custom carved fruit or whatever the main ingredient is as decor on top of the batch. I would recommend this place during hot or cold weather because you never know when you're experiencing a sweet and decadent craving! They also make milkshakes with your choice of gelato, smoothies, affogato, and fat-free sorbet (strawberries & champagne and blackberry cabernet are delicious). You can get a single or double scoop and they even have your everyday option to get a pint or bigger. Individual servings are topped with a mini pirouette which is a nice touch :)"}
{"text":"Best gelato spot in Gilbert!  I love how friendly the staff is and how cute the shop is as well!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. OMG!! LOVE this place. We went back home for a visit and my BF and I started at a sushi shop then Frost for dessert. First of all it's ver reasonably price for this high-quality daily made fresh gelato and sorbet. I'm so used to paying for frozen yogurt stores in San Diego which end up costing 7 to 9 dollars or more depending on your toppings. The small cups at this gelato place are four dollars and the medium cups are five dollars. They have some that are your typical traditional flavors they also have very unique combinations and some with alcohol wine or liquors in them. If you're ever in the San Tan Mall area take a quick break and treat yourself to a heavenly treat."}
{"text":"The best gelato shop Ive ever been to. I dont want to eat at any other place ever again. Im trying to convince them to build one in my garage."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Like REALLY friendly. So good. After gelato 62 closed down, I was really sad but I found this place.  One down side is that it's really hard to find unless you happen to be wandering around the area. Probably google maps fault but it took me almost a half hour to find the place."}
{"text":"My favorite Gelato place, yet!  I just want all the flavors.. But my favorites are the Salted Carmel topped with a sorbet. We usually go with the lemon, mango, or strawberry.   They have the Kiwi gelato over the summer, that one is my #1 favorite! It tastes like 10 kiwis in one...  It gets pretty busy here, every time we go the line is coming out of the building."}
{"text":"Now I understand the hype and all the amazing reviews. Excellent gelato! My favorite is the espresso. My kids love the bumble gum flavor. I also like the regular chocolate. I tried the salted caramel but it was a little Too sweet for me but still Very delicious."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing gelato place. The staff is so patient and energetic which makes the experience even more delightful. I tried it the first time two weeks ago and since have been in three times! The Andes mint and dark chocolate are my favorite however strawberry is high on my list as well. It's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"new gelato spot in san tan village! i did enjoy my gelato last wednesday night. It was creamy yet light.  we ordered small cups-for me sea salt caramel and the mint and chip for mr h. the gelato was good, the unique flavors were great but the price? $8 (7.93) a tad pricey for tiny cups.  it's an OK price for a couple but I imagine for a family it could get expensive.  anyways i enjoyed my treat and it's a cool little shoppe."}
{"text":"The gelato was really good I had gotten coconut the only thing I didn't like was the customer service the employees weren't really that friendly nor enthusiastic and there was hardly anywhere to sit which was kind of a bummer but other than that it was a good experience I probably won't go back but if the customer service was great I would of left a tip so step your game up"}
{"text":"Best gelato I've ever had! I could eat frost every day yummy. Peanut butter crunch gotta try. Great job frost :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I first went there with my mom to order a birthday cake for my sister. There was nobody in the store and the owner was there and she literally let us sample as many gelato flavors that we pleased before we made our decision. They have the coolest cakes. They are so unique. I ended up going back a week later and getting a cake for my son's 13th birthday. It was perfect for him. They decorated the top with candies and cookies. Everyone loved it. This place is top notch. The gelato is amazing the way they decorate all of the different flavors is beautiful this places over the top"}
{"text":"My daughter and I just went to FROST Gelato in the San Tan Village in Gilbert.(between Brio & Cantina Laredo on Painted Sky Drive)   If you like Gelato, you will LOVE this Gelato!  If you have never tried it, get ready to be addicted because this is at the top of the best Gelato I have ever tasted!  There are so many positives for this business:  the shop is beautiful; it looks more like a nice restaurant than a place to buy Gelato.  The staff is dressed in white and welcomes you when you enter.  The Gelato Case is filled with a vibrant, enticing assortment of flavors.  The staff was encouraging letting you sample before deciding, and I had to have the Sea Salt Caramel.  I rarely eat anything Caramel, but this is an outstanding flavor!  What I sampled was also amazing! My daughter chose coconut and loved hers.  Here is the best part:  I picked up a brochure and already knew Gelato is a healthier dessert than many other choices, but learned that Gelato is only 3-8% butterfat compared to ice cream which contains 12-25% butterfat.  Thankfully, there is no sacrifice in the taste!  I also looked in their dessert case which featured delectable looking treats!  We are looking for ward to going back...also good to note is that they are open Sun -Thurs 11am-10PM and Fri and Sat 11am until 11pm!  They provide inside and outside seating.  In the summer months it is great to have the option to go over at night and be able to sit outside enjoying something this refreshing.   We moved to Gilbert from upstate NY, for us this will be a fun place to visit again and again!  I would say...hurry up and try it!  I would select more than five stars for this if I could."}
{"text":"Frost is a great gelato shop that has a lot of unique and interesting flavors.  Sometimes, it's hard to pick just one or two, but I usually make up my mind pretty quickly.  Their best selling flavor is Seasalt Caramel and I have to admit it is one of my go-to flavors when I'm having a tough time deciding.  One of my personal favorites is their Dark Chocolate.  It's pretty thick and is almost like eating a cold brownie, but I think it's delicious and get it almost every time we go.  One of my only complaints about Frost is, as soon as you go through the line and get up to the counter, the employees ask what they can get for you right away without giving you a chance to look in the case to see what flavors they have.  I know that theer is a menu on the wall, but they do have seasonal flavors that are not listed on the menu and I usually need a few moments to browse the case to see what strikes me that day.  The other thing about their menu is that it is not always accurate.  As I write this review, I am looking at their menu online and see that they have Butter Pecan listed as a flavor but on one visit when I tried to order Butter Pecan they told me it was a seasonal flavor and they did not have it available.  This can be concerning since I cannot trust that the flavors on the menu are the flavors in the case.  They only have four indoor tables and during the busy times this are usually packed but there are a few tables outside and while it's not 117 degrees out, they are a nice place to sit.  Frost also has some great no-sugar added flavors which is nice.  I usually end up going to Frost with my wife and 18 month old so (who loves bananas) so its nice to be able to get him a no-sugar added banana gelato and not feel like I'm filling him up with terrible things that he shouldn't be eating.  Overall, Frost is a great place and we love going there.  When you go, tell the staff that you need a minute to look at the falvors they have and they will give you the time you need.  Frost is also open later than most of the other stores in the San Tan mall (10pm during the week and 11pm on the weekends), so it's nice to have a late-night place to hit before the day is done."}
{"text":"This gelato is amazing!  My fiance has a dairy allergy, and all of the dairy free sorbets are so rich and delicious!  I highly recommend the blackberry cabernet and limoncello!"}
{"text":"So perfect for being a lactose intolerant! Best stuff on Earth! Awesome and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We tried this place today after looking at all the raving reviews from Yelp. It was a big disappointment for me taste-wise. Service was fast and there are many varieties but the most important is taste!  I tasted sea salt caramel, mango and roasted almond, all turned out not so great. I just cannot understand how it tastes so good to all others 0_0. My boyfriend didn't like it either. We both couldn't finish our small cups. O wells ."}
{"text":"I love this place. After I went here, I can't eat ice cream  anymore because compared to Gelato it tastes like crap. Also, Gelato is much better for you than ice cream.  The employees here are always friendly and I have been here a lot. I recommend ordering the smallest size of Gelato because it is much more concentrated and denser than ice cream."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!!!! Sea salt caramel is to die for :).. my boyfriend bought me a gelato cake from here for my birthday and it was seriously so beautiful! i cant get over this place"}
{"text":"The very best of the best right here, staff is electric, friendly and very personable. Gelato is amazing and soooooo much to choose from, place is clean and the decor is very interesting...in a good way!!! Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love to stop by for a taste of Heaven!  It is worth the parallel parking on some occasion!  Ha ha"}
{"text":"Frost Gelato doesn't need my review because EVERYONE seems to love this place, including me.  I'm a sucker for good gelato and Frost has the best.  Great atmosphere and even worth standing in line (which is common but the line moves fast).  The staff is friendly and you can't beat the location (across the street from the Apple store).  My favorite is the Sea Salt Caramel which the staff says is their #1 seller. Around Christmas they also have Peppermint which shouldn't be legal because it's so delicious.  I once tried the hot chocolate...wow!  It tastes like a hot melted version of the chocolate gelato and warmed me right up the night I had it.  Keep up the great work Frost!  You deserve the praise."}
{"text":"Once again Frost lives up to their standards.  Focused on the customer and a high quality product!"}
{"text":"Very good gelato, but they need to manage and control the line better.  People will sample 10+ flavors, and crowd the small case, which makes it impossible for anyone else to pick a flavor.  The flavor selection is good, but comparable to other gelato shops."}
{"text":"We loved everything about Frost! The service was great and the Gelato speaks for itself, absolutely delicious! We especially loved that everything was made fresh on site and does not contain preservatives.  Friendly staff and a clean store. Definitely a place we plan to visit more often."}
{"text":"Best gelato you can find anywhere and price is reasonable for the size. In the little cup... They pack so much ice cream in there!!! Any other gelato places don't compare. love love love!"}
{"text":"We love Frost! It's always worth the wait for the gelato! There's also consistent friendly and fast service!"}
{"text":"So many great flavors to choose from, and such fantastic service.  The salted caramel and peanut butter crunch were my favorites, but equally as delicious was the Irish Cream!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Kristen is wonderful! She was beyond helpful and friendly! We were so lucky to visit one day with no lines and have a little one on one time with her! We learned a lot about the amazing gelato.   Just remember the line may look long sometimes but they are super quick! Get in line enjoy the samples and water they bring out while your waiting!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and surprisingly inexpensive! Best gelato ever! I recommend the strawberry champagne. Nice to come for a little dessert with friends. The workers are really nice and it is a clean place. It gets pretty busy but they are quick. Also don't feel bad for sampling the different flavors, there are so many and you will want to make sure you have the perfect flavor."}
{"text":"YES! Yum. After a friend recommended Frost, I was slow in trying it because it's pretty far from where I live. I was in the area recently so I figured I should stop in because I wasn't sure when I'd be nearby again. So glad I made some extra time.  It's located in a shopping complex behind an Italian restaurant. There's a lot of parking on the street but it's probably pretty full on weekends.  The shop is big, modern, and the staff are really nice and friendly. The case of gelato is huge, and I had to walk back and forth a few times. I finally decided to have one serving of my favorite: stracciatella. It was awesome. So creamy, wonderfully flaked and blended chocolate chips, rich, and delicious. They added a little pirouette cookie for garnish which I gladly ate.  I will be back to try the many other flavors."}
{"text":"Amazing! Was visiting family in the area and they introduced us to Frost. We went back the next two days for a total of three visits in three days! Flavors are amazing and spot on. The gelato is so rich and creamy. Tried the sherbet too but like the gelato more. Staff was always super friendly and let us sample anything we wanted. They get extra points for being so friendly to our kids. Favorite flavors were Gianduia (Chocolate with Hazelnut) and apple pie."}
{"text":"It's very yummy!! Very friendly staff and you get to try as many flavored as you want!!"}
{"text":"I like everything about this place, except where it's located. That's only because I choose to live near Phoenix/Tempe and this little gem is way out in San Tan Village (Cozy American Suburbia). If I don't hear gun shots at night, it's not home. But I digress...  This little shop is superb. From the carefully, crafted, creamy creations to the modern sleek decor - They had me. The staff is exceptionally nice as well, and will let you sample until your heart's content.  I just love all the little accoutrements that each tray has. Cute little bottles of champagne in the Champagne and Strawberry Gelato, beautifully displayed Mangos, in the rich sweet mango. It's a feast for the eyes, and your palette.  Highly advise checking them out if you're in the San Tan area. One word to a Gelato virgin: It's denser and more flavorful than regular ice cream. Trust me when I tell you a small is enough.  Enjoy! : )"}
{"text":"So so happy that I have it a try. Being dairy free I never thought I would enjoy a gelato shop, but it is possible. The ladies at frost have an extensive variety of gelatos which looked amazing but also offer an equally impressive sorbet selection.. Strawberry Cristal for V-day has to be the show stopper but at $25 bucks a serving I had to pass. The banana/Cabernet combo I conjured was by far the best sorbet I've ever had. All sorbets are made worn fruit (12 bananas in this case), sugar, and water ( or a whole bottle of Cabernet).. Delish, oddly Frost has warmed my heart. my only suggestions would be to play at the alternatives that they offer a bit stronger. Had I not been walking my child to sooth a pre nap tantrum several times and read the small print about the dairy-free deserts I would have never known, or stopped by.. Great work gals, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best gelato in the valley and competes with the best of Italy. I search for the best gelato places in Europe whenever I visit and Frost is my second favorite in the world! They keep updating their roster so you can always try something new. The workers are always very friendly and the prices for a large take home container are still reasonable.  The bathroom in San Tan mall location is actually really nice and clean (can't underestimate how important this is)."}
{"text":"Many delicious flavors, unlimited samples, friendly staff, clean facilities, and complimentary water!"}
{"text":"Clean, wonderful, delicious. The gelato selections are numerous and out of this world yummy. It's a must visit!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for dessert! Josh is an employee here and he was so friendly when helping me order a cake for my sisters birthday. Overall, amazing customer service and outstanding gelato."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week in the San tan village shopping center. There's outdoor seating and indoor. The service is prompt and the line moves quickly. You can sample any flavor but I'm dairy intolerant. So the lady suggested the dairy free options, later that night i was so sick. I can tell you that there definitely is dairy in the suggested non dairy options. I will not be back unfortunately. La dolce vita is the best around."}
{"text":"Why I only have one check-in here is beyond me.  I have been here at least 3 times (must've forgot to checkin), but I digress.  This is such an amazing way to have a treat.  The variation of flavors is great and I could eat Gelato as a treat every day of the week.  Frost has the variety of flavors to try and enjoy.  I love how pretty they display the flavors and it makes it fun to try the flavors you enjoy."}
