{"text":"Great original Mexican food; I love this place when ever I want to have a home made Mexican dinner or breakfast I come here.  Customer Service is great and super clean place. 100% recommended."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not the best in town. I got 2 tacos, one pastor and one barbacoa. Barbacoa was good but the pastor was rather chewy and greasy. My kids had cheese quesadilla with rice and beans, those were good, especially because of hand made tortillas they do. Aguas frescas were good too, we had horchata and guayaba."}
{"text":"New Restaurant.com merchant so we figured we'd try it and very happy we did. Seems to be family run, good service, very friendly.  What I liked about the food was the dishes we ordered were not drenched in sauce. The style is different than other Mexican restaurants we've eaten at and I really like the style they cook in. Everything seemed to be fresh and home made.  Chips are different, I think they are their homemade tortillas sliced and fired, I liked them my 13 yo son did not.  We had two bowls of menudo Cheese enchiladas Garlic shrimp  All were excellent. We'll be back even without the restaurant.com, although I'm glad they had one otherwise we would have never known about this great hole in the wall.  UPDATE: Shortly after our visit this place stopped taking restaurant.com."}
{"text":"Best menudo ever better than mom's and her menudo is bomb.com favorite place to eat in Vegas after a long night of drinking"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Las Vegas. Off the strip, reasonable prices, and the best Mexican cuisine I have had. Clean and family oriented. There's nothing like a DELICIOUS, affordable meal when you are in Las Vegas. Dine where the locals are dining."}
{"text":"The carne Asada Dona machi and cahuamanta sting ray soup is the best you must try"}
{"text":"Every time you visit Vegas you must have this Mexican food. It is amazing very delicious and good customer service. Go try it"}
{"text":"The service lacks ambition!  My waitress took our order after about 10 minutes of waiting. Not only are we the only ones here but after she took our order she sits back down 2 tables behind us and eats, I really hope she washed her hands.   There are no free refills and they carry mostly coke products out of a fridge.   Still waiting on my food. Will update after ward."}
{"text":"While needing something to eat before work, I came across this establishment while using Yelp's search function. It was one of the few decent looking places that were open early in the morning.  The first thing I ordered was the pastor super nachos.  I wish I could describe the flavor of this dish but it was hard to differentiate the flavors since everything was so salty. The nachos consisted of pork pastor, refried beans, cheese, some type of white sauce which I assume was sour cream, some type of red sauce, and guacamole. The best thing about the dish was the chips and guac. The chips tasted like tortillas that were fried, and the guac had good flavor with fresh onions, tomatoes, and chunky avocado.  I was still kinda hungry so I ordered three tacos: pastor, chicken, and beef. I almost ordered these from the jump, and I wish I would have. The tacos ended up being excellent. They weren't salty, all the different meats were moist and tender while having nice bits of grilled and crispy char, and were nice sized and filling. They were street style with onions and salantro on top.   I would give the nachos 1-2 stars, and I would give the tacos and the good fast service I got 4 stars. I will definetly come back for more tacos and since they are cooking fresh food early in the morning."}
