{"text":"We came to have breakfast. All the menus seemed delicious. We ordered a sandwich with our meat. It matched coffee and it was delicious"}
{"text":"I had the Hatch Green Chili Skillet and let me tell you some thing. It was the best thing Iv ever had in my life the potato's were cooked perfectly along with the over medium eggs. Very nice and delicious dish i will for sure come back again and definitely recommend this place for everyone out there SERVICE IS AWESOME"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in based on other reviews. Don't let the plan decor turn you away! The server was attentive. The food was delivered fast, tasted great, and was offered at a good price. The San Francisco French Toast was perfect and the blueberry and strawberry topping was flavorful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. We decided to come due to the high reviews. This is a very unassuming restaurant, but they know how to cook! J can easily say this is THE Best waffle she has ever had. The batter was just the right amount of sweet, cooked golden (not pale like some restaurants leave it) and the blueberries in the berry waffle were baked in not just sprinkled over top.  L had the California Benedict and after seeing a Benedict challenge on Masterchef this past week- this Benedict would live up to Gordon Ramsay's standards- the hollandaise was just right and the eggs were cooked perfectly. We have nothing bad to say. Service was fast and friendly and tables turn quickly so don't be put off if you have to wait a few minutes for a table to clear."}
{"text":"Stopped in as it was on our way. Food was good and filling. Friendly service! Will stop in when in the neighborhood again!!"}
{"text":"Went in shorty after the grand opening and I was pleasantly surprised! The food was delicious. Our order was correct, staff was friendly and organized and the wait for food wasn't long at all. They only have 2 high chairs so we had to hold our child on our lap until one became available but other than that we had a great experience! Very glad it's so close to our house."}
{"text":"I got the California Benedict cause for any first time visit, I get what's marked as \"most popular\" on their menu. I thought for what I paid, it was a very average dish. There wasnt anything extraordinary about the eggs. I think there was paprika sprinkled on it? But I barely tasted it. The biscuit that they used for the Benedict...I don't mean this in a bad way, but the taste of it reminded me of the biscuit McDonalds used for their menu. It just further emphasizes the \"average\" taste it has. The avocado slices were nice to chew on and weren't squishy so that was a nice plus. What I really liked about this dish were the potatoes. I recommend them as the potato slices rather than the hashed form (they give you the choice). They have such a nice crunchy texture and flavor too them. Not too salty either.   The service was nice, it looked like a family owned place so the atmosphere was very cozy and warm. They make sure that you're not sitting there doing nothing for too long.   Overall, this isnt a place I would recommend to my friends for brunch but it's a place that I wouldnt mind going to once in a while."}
{"text":"Not sure why others thought this place was so great.  Service was top notch, but the food is very average and forgettable.... coffee was horrible."}
{"text":"Had the San Francisco French toast. Nothing but good things to say about this place. Bacon was cooked perfectly and was nice and thick. Over medium eggs were perfect. Everyone in The family literally cleaned their plates. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This place was EXCEPTIONAL!. They allowed for a customized order and make their own country fried steak!  They quickly remedied a mistake and their food was sensational!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Cute little diner! Small but amazing menu! Unlimited refills on hot and iced coffee! Best iced coffee I have had in a while!"}
{"text":"Great little family owned local joint! Delicious food. Ordered an omelette and they were happy to make a couple mods for me! Very good!"}
{"text":"Generous portions along with fast, courteous service.  Pancakes melt in your mouth with a touch of cinnamon.  French toast was soft & moist like mom makes. Definitely recommend for a great breakfast with friendly service."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect as it wasn't very crowded but it was after golf and close to the golf course and needed breakfast. GREAT choice! The green hatch chili skillet was full of deliciousness! Had to bring half home. The traditional eggs over easy were fine but Ted skinned potatoes were delicious. The sausage links were the best I've ever had and browned perfectly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this brand new restaurant and I am really impressed. This is only their second week in business so I expected a few kinks that would need to be worked out.  They obviously planned things right from the start. This is a small place with a homey, country diner feel.  There was a nice variety of breakfast and lunch menu choices available.  I had the French toast breakfast with brioche French toast, eggs and bacon. The warm maple syrup was especially good- I wouldn't be surprised if it was homemade. My husband got a chicken fried steak breakfast and he liked it a lot. He was especially pleased that they offered a choice between hash browns or country potatoes.  The service was phenomenal. Everyone was friendly and our experienced server was attentive without being intrusive - that's sometimes a hard line to walk. I'm a die hard Diet Coke fan and I've noticed a lot of small restaurants choosing a cheaper option. It's a little thing to many, but I was very happy to discover that Coke products were available and the machine was set up and calibrated perfectly.  No flat or watery soda here!  This is a place we will visit again and again. I like supporting small, locally owned businesses - this homey little place is an easy choice!"}
{"text":"I just are there for the first time and it was fantastic! It has that old school diner taste."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this place!  For starters the staff is super friendly which makes for a good day when you start really early - they were open at 6.  I love corned beef hash and theirs is a unique twist on the classic.  A huge non-greasy portion that didn't have a single tough piece or gristle.  Service was quick and the waiters were very attentive."}
{"text":"Decided to try breakfast in Arizona since we were vacationing there and came across this place on Yelp after leaving another restaurant due to poor service etiquette! The Crowned Egg is a new restaurant but had excellent reviews, so we wanted to try! We were immediately greeted and seated! My fianc√© ordered the Cinnamon French Toast with eggs, turkey sausage and potatoes and I had the Berry Griddle Pancakes, eggs and pork sausage! The food was made as if you was eating at your grandmas house! It was piping hot, filling, just all around wonderful! If you are in the area and looking for a place with great hospitality, quiet, and great food- this is the place! Will definitely return when visiting Arizona!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's small and tucked away in a shopping plaza. Right next to Albertson's which is great because we ate before shopping!  THEY HAVE HOMEMADE CHORIZO! And it is delicious! It's not greasy and it's full of flavor. My mom had the chorizo platter with red potatoes pinto beans and eggs  I had the bacon avocado omelette with red potatoes, I couldn't finish it...I tried so hard to finish it. It was so delicious!!  Reasonably priced and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and very clean bathroom.... coffee is very good. Simply served like homemade."}
{"text":"My bf and I went in here about a week after their grand opening and were pleasantly surprised by the great food, good service and prices! Their menu has a variety of not only Mexican breakfast but American as well and even crepes. We loved it so much that we went back a week later and tried something different which was also delish. This will be our regular spot and I highly recommend it to anyone. You won't be disappointed! We can't wait to go back next weekend for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a nice family run restaurant. The service was awesome and the food was delicious (I had the Hatch green chile scramble). This is the type of local place that you root for to succeed. I will come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Just tried The Crowned Egg for breakfast this morning, the newly opened breakfast/lunch spot in Gilbert is small in size but big on flavor. Husband had the meat lover's breakfast, quite generous in portion and tasty, I had corned beef hash, also a generous portion and very good. We also ordered a side of chorizo to test for future visits, which is homemade and not overly spicy. I see a chorizo omelet in the future, with a side of hash browns and a tortilla on the side I support small business owners and I highly recommend you give The Crowned Egg a try too!!"}
{"text":"Clean and respectful! People are friendly and attentive! The avocado toast was excellent!"}
{"text":"We have been there 3 times for a total of 7 meals. We have enjoyed the food. Everything has been cooked to our taste. Service is excellent. Coffee is constantly topped up though you have to ask for another soft drink. We've tried the Avocado-Tomato-Egg on toast, bacon cheeseburger, corned beef hash with red potatoes, and cobb salad among others.  Their ranch dressing is made in house rather than packaged or jarred.  It is a small place and if it gets too popular I can see wait times soon. We have been there at \"off times\" and have been seated immediately.    It is open 6:30 AM to 2:30 PM Mon-Sat and open at 6 AM on Sundays."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed breakfast twice at this restaurant.  The service was friendly and prompt and the food was fresh, delicious and attractively presented. If in the the Gilbert area give it a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We visited The Crowned Egg for the first time in mid June.  First impression was very good!  The service was very good and the staff friendly.  I had the meat lovers platter, which included 3 eggs, ham steak, sausage links, bacon, breakfast potatoes, and toast for $10.99.  While all of the food was very good and served hot, the bacon was fantastic!  The eggs were properly cooked over medium.  The potatoes were delicious (I opted for the oven roasted potatoes rather than hash browns, but you do get to choose.)  My wife had the corned beef hash that she described as very good and large with tons of real corned beef.  We both brought home take home boxes.  Also, I thought the coffee was excellent as well.  The decor is fairly basic, that of a local diner that just opened, but was clean and perfectly acceptable.  We will definitely be back and highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely coming back.  This is a Breakfast Lunch only place.  The food was great.  Had the California Benedict and eggs were poached to perfection.  Wifey had an omelette that she loved.  Hash browns were golden brown and moist with crispy top!  Bacon cooked perfectly.  Service was prompt in a full place on a Sat morning!  Food took only 5-10 minutes.  The place is pretty plain but who cares when the food and service are fantastic.  Thanks Miriam for serving us so well :-). Our compliments to the \"chef\" also :-). Definitely will return for another breakfast and will have to try their lunch menu also!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic new local spot for breakfast and lunch! Spoke with the owners and they strive to make most items from scratch. Blueberry pancakes are phenomenal, large and cooked to a crispness on the outside with a fluffiness on the inside. Chicken fried steak and the sausage gravy is lit along with the breakfast potatoes. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Food was very good in friendly atmosphere. Breakfast yum yum ar a reasonable price. Will come back"}
{"text":"A bit off the beaten path but always got to try a place that has egg in the name. It's a quiet but very friendly place seemingly run as a family establishment. We partook in a variety of dishes including the Cobb salad, California Benedict and the Corned Beef Hash eggs. While the Cobb didn't have a hard boiled egg - surprisingly - it was still very good especially as they added some seasoned bread on the side. The two egged Benedict also was quite tasty and the corned beef meal was Huge and clearly made from quality ingredients rather than some canned stuff that is convenient but otherwise plain. As noted service excellent and friendly and attentive but not intrusive. Definitely would recommend if in the area - and they give a $2 coupon for next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal the food was fresh and tasty. The breakfast was great my dad and I both enjoyed the great food and also our service was excellent. Manny was our server and he was excellent. If you're looking for some great food great environment and good service I definitely recommend this place,"}
{"text":"So my family has found a new favorite breakfast joint in Gilbert. We went to a late breakfast today and I suggested that we check out this new place. We were pleasantly surprised and thoroughly impressed with both the food and the service! My wife and daughters are extremely picky as it comes to breakfast restaurants, so to get their thumbs-up says a lot. We met one of the owners, Jeanette and her brother Manny. They were both attentive and extremely friendly. We had a great conversation. I had that Chiliquiles and they were the bomb.com. The chips were still crisp and not soggy. It had onions, bell peppers, pork sausage, and an amazing green sauce. My family kept picking off my plate and it was annoying. My wife had the chorizo plate and we have never had such great chorizo. It was so flavorful and not greasy. My vegan daughter ( there is one in every family), had the veggie skillet (eggs on the side of couse) and it was gone. And my other daughter had pancakes and the bacon and eggs breakfast.  All amazing!   Try this place out and you'll understand what the hype is all about!"}
{"text":"Meh. I would say the service and the food were equally average. Yup let us now. We were expecting stellar food and service with foreign a half star reviews however that was not our experience at all. The host presented us with menus and water and hung around so I assumed he was our waiter and began to order and then he let us know that he was not our waiter so I apologized. He came back a few minutes later and said he would be our waiter. I was confused but OK. About 5 to 7 minutes later our food came out but no silverware. We requested it from our makeshift waiter. Three of us stoned. I ordered the California eggs Benedict and they forgot the avocado smoked pep Rica or whatever the seasoning is over-the-top as this picture. When I brought it to my waiters attention requesting the avocado, he said he should sure we could probably forgot it and came back with avocado. We also ordered corn beef hash which boasts of fresh corned Beef however it was quite lackluster and very dry. What's the name \"Crowned Egg\" you would expect the egg game to be on point play after our meals were brought out, the waiter delivered another egg over easy as requested because the chef messed up with the egg that was served with the meal. Quite a few blunders. The restaurant was very drab and had no decor. I felt like I was at a soft opening of a restaurant that's meant only for family and friends because of all of the errors and that three of the six on staff working on the curtain hanging from PVC rod that looked like it was being made into a backdrop for a quincinera in the corner of the dining room. Zero ambience as there is no music, no decor and no television. I would compare the food to a condensed knock-off version of Waffle House."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was a good experience overall. My waitress, Janet, I recognize from a place I used to eat and we had a pleasant conversation. There are some problems, but it is all the standard new restaurant problems like timing and newly working together things. The food was very good and made to order. I had coffee and carnitas chilaquiles with green sauce. I do recommend this place and will come again. They have a good amount of items on their menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"It's okay... if you don't know how to cook breakfast or just want a quick bite, this would be the place to visit. Staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean. I ordered the All Meat Skillet and what I got was anything but meat on it...  the hash brown was over cooked (too crispy and burned).   Also ordered the Hazelnut Crepe, but tasted more like chocolate Nutella which is not bad but was looking forward to the Hazelnut.   Wish them luck and hope they're open to suggestions."}
{"text":"We went here for Father's Day expecting that it might be busy, it was, but everyone was hustling around and got us in quickly. Each of our breakfasts were very delish. Bacon was thick and tasty. Eggs cooked perfectly. Employees were friendly. While there I found out this is a family run business, I am always happy to support small businesses trying to make it in todays big business world. With their service and quality I believe they will do just great!"}
{"text":"I arrived at 8:55am waiting by the desk for someone to come out. Went by the bug black door trying to get someones attention. No one helped me. I just wanted breakfast before work but i will never be coming back here i guess. I have a video"}
{"text":"An excellent, new mom n pop joint in Gilbert. Great, attentive service! I had the pork carnitas hash with over easy eggs covered in a Hatch green chili sauce. Big portion, resulting in a leftover taco later on. The crepes were very good as well. Will be back to try the chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict I've had in a long time. The staff was friendly and the service was excellent.  I would recommend it to my fiends and family and go back often."}
{"text":"We were greeted immediately the staff was very friendly and even though they were busy we got our drinks quickly and our order taken at the same time. Our breakfast came out soon after. My wife ordered basic bacon and eggs, the eggs we're done perfectly but the Bacon really stood out it was thick and very flavorful! I ordered the chilaquiles and they we're simply excellent! It's nice to have another option for our weekend breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"Good quick home cooked breakfast. This place puts focus on food and service. We walked up this morning and had a fun family breakfast. Good for kids! Good for groups.  This place is new and there wasn't a wait at 9am, but as people learn about it, they will get busy."}
{"text":"This is a great new spot!! It is a hidden gem with a great menu. I had the chorizo omelette and my boyfriend had the California Benedict! Both were phenomenal. The staff was friendly and we felt welcome.  Definitely a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"It's ok. The people are nice. Food was not too impressive, but if you don't feel like making your own mess at home, you'll get about the same here. We went on Mother's Day and they had chocolate strawberries for the moms. Nice touch. We ended up there because they didn't have a wait time."}
{"text":"First time visit  Water was obviously unfiltered tap water Food was average at best? Service was slow as they needed more help!"}
{"text":"We had really good basic breakfasts when we went. Looking around there were other more creative dishes but we stuck to the basics for our first time. The thought was if they can't do the basics well the rest might not be real great.  Food was really good. My Denver Omelet was on point. Veggies were perfectly cooked. Tasted great.  Diner os pretty small. Service was very nice.  They are new so it wasn't perfect but we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Little family owned restaurant. Good breakfast, good servers, good service!  We will definitely be back again! I had eggs benidict and they were so yummy. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Reasonably priced to for all the food you get!"}
