{"text":"i dont even live near this water place, but i make the trip from flamingo and sanhill (where theres a similar one but nasty water if they even have water.) to get water and ice when needed!  THANK YOU WHO EVER OWNS THIS!"}
{"text":"I love the fact someone built this place near my house. I use it often to get bulk ice, fill fauve gallon jugs of water. It seems like the filters are changed often enough because ice is clear. Great place. Great Price! Get your bags and bulk ice here!"}
{"text":"Love love love this water stop! I can get clean ice dispensed directly into my cooler or a bag if I'm running late to a party. The water is super clean and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I have been getting my ice and water from here for what seems like forever. The water is always cruelest and clean and delicious. The ice is even more awesome because it has a cooler dump and will dump 20 pounds of ice straight into your cooler!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We fill our water jugs up here and won't go anywhere else.  They have the best tasting water for a very reasonable price."}
