{"text":"Went there for dim sum with the family. Food was alright, fair price, little to choose from though. Service is alright. I would return."}
{"text":"I agree with Jennifer K.- Good Tasty Dim Sum!

I came before 11am on a weekday and I'm pretty sure each plate was $2.  I was here with 4 people and we got around 12 plates, including tax it was less than $30.  I would not say that is expensive (unless they mixed up the bill... )

I like that you get the entire menu that you can check off (with items in both english and chinese) so you don't have to wait for someone to push a cart with stuff that you like.  Some things they did right: sticky rice with chicken, tripe, sui mai, and mango pudding.

It was fresh and not too greasy which is a huge plus in my books."}

Good Tasty Dim Sum!!

But beware, please come before 11 or after 2pm for the special ($2.20 for any size) if not you will be so shocked at your bill during the regular lunch hour (my friend once went that for regular price for 3 dim sum order for 2 people costing her $19!)

Great selections of dim sum, you can order by checking off what you want and they will make that for you. Some of the items that are not on the list, they will be pushing the carts around.

Sometimes they do mixed up the bills, please check it properly! There are additional charges for table cloth! and of course tea is charged by the person.

I usually just order the dim sum for take out!"}
