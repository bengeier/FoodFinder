{"text":"If you are looking for chain resteraunt food using cheap, processed ingredients, then go elsewhere. Ordered family pizza. Was very tasty. Will be coming back when in the area."}
{"text":"Rude. The wedding soup is the only thing worth going for. The staff and owner are rude an act like you are an inconvenience to them."}
{"text":"This place used to have great food but it seems the management has changed and so has the food for the worse."}
{"text":"Vicinato Pizza is our favorite little local Italian gem. We eat there quite frequently because we live within a mile and it's a great place for comfort food. It's nothing fancy, the veal is all breaded as is most of the chicken and many of the appetizers. The marinara sauce could be better seasoned-it's pretty bland. But we still love coming here. I usually order the eggplant parm-it's delish. Hubby usually orders 1 of the veal dishes and is always happy with it. Our server seems to always be Stephanie and she's very warm and friendly. The service is great. Oh and the warm Italian bread-yum!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced cute little italian spot. Pizza was good however I got the veal parm and the sauce was horrible. The sauce is very sweet and not seasoned correctly. I would stay away with anything that has marinara sauce on it. Their italian wedding soup was great!"}
{"text":"Horrible un friendly and cheese and food all over the carpet. Maybe the health department should get after them. Cant even say hello and the waitress was horrible."}
{"text":"The prices are way to high. Good service from the waitresses but the owner is rude. Their sauce is pretty blah, tasteless.  I ordered 2 Italian wedding soup to go and was charged $11.00 . I thought a piece of bread would come with and I asked the owner and he said no, that's extra! Really?  Will not be going back..."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have expected this place to have really good pizza (though that just might be my bias due to its close proximity to Amy Joy and Boston Market). I went in here for a takeout salad and slice during the workday. The service was friendly and, while not exactly fast, it was adequate. There's a bunch of tables to sit down, which I'm not sure I'd ever have the desire to do, but which made this less of a pizzeria and more of a \"restaurant.\"  The salad was laughable - iceberg lettuce, ONE tomato wedge, and that's it. (I think it might also come with cheese, but I said no thanks to that. What's with the Midwest and their cheesy salads? Blecch.)  Anyway, what made the salad stand out was the amazing Italian dressing. Also, it came with a piece of soft, puffy bread that reminded me of what you'd get in a Brooklyn diner basket. Heavenly, with a little plastic/foil pat of butter thrown in.  The pizza slice itself was very large, filling, and good. I can't really compare it to anything in particular, so I'll leave it at that.  Now that I've read the other reviews, I want to come back to try the veal parmigiana!  Oh, one more thing: I think they stop selling slices mid-day, or I guess when they run out. The first time I attempted to come in for a slice around 3 pm, only to be turned away. Wah!!"}
{"text":"Usually love this place and walked in around 8:55 tonight.... but when yelp says you close at 10 on Saturday and you really close at 9 don't give your customers a snarky response when we just walked in to confirm your close time. Mind you there was a party of about 8 just placing their order (which is rude if you close at 9) but a party of 2 is much faster than a party of 8.. just saying."}
{"text":"Always good for delivery with fresh ingredients, though their salad is pretty disappointing.  Pasta dishes are quite good, and proportioned for about two meals, so this has become a take-out regular spot. The marinara sauce leaves a lot to be desired, but thats what fettuccine alfredo is for.  However, I'm not a fan of their pizza at all, and would actually prefer to have delivery.  Nice quick local italian. Nothing special, but its pretty reliable and consistent, making it a very... 'what do you want to eat?\" \"eh, i dunno. whatever\" \"vicinato's?\" \"k...\" kinda place."}
{"text":"Good pasta and pizza! Very friendly wait staff. Very tasty and fresh ingredients. Dinner salad is good size and cold.have come here for years and will continue. Eggplant Parmesan appetizer is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday.  Service was great and the bread is top notch.  Wedding soup is also excellent.  The cavatelli and meatballs were eh.  I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but I can't do 4 stars.  Didn't have the pizza so I can't offer comment on that.  Lots of regulars here for lunch, all of the tables were full.  I'd go back, would like to try the pizza.  The service gets 4+ stars! it was excellent."}
{"text":"Good service good bread, the half moon mozzarella is good, me being a jersey boy should have known better than get pizza from here , it's defiantly not like back home. Would I go again yes I would just wouldn't get the pizza!"}
{"text":"One star, why? First their service is lousy. Second the server referred to as \"honey\" when really l was \"Salty\" Third they let me sit an extra 10 or so minutes before giving me what l paid for, a super tiny pizza at a Lamborghini price tag No More."}
{"text":"I live in california but have relatives in cleveland, and every time i fly out to visit i always gotta make sure i get my vicinato fix. good pizza, good service, and GREAT veal parmigiana."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed eating here alot in my opinion it's one Of the yummiest pizza places I've ever had its so fresh taste like homeade pizza pricy but it is by far worth it. And they have those crazy flavored sodas loves it"}
{"text":"Ordered pasta dinners. The pasta was way undercooked and the sauce was tasteless. Couldn't finish our dinners. Advice to the owner: season your pasta and sauce while you are cooking it. Everything tasted like wax.   The prices are too high. $13.50 for pasta with a slice of bread and iceberg lettuce is nuts. Also paid $3.50 for a 2\" meatball.   Owner was rude when I questioned the bill. Heard him laughing at me with another customer who was standing there as I walked out.   Definitely won't return.   More advice: DRAIN THE PASTA! I had a half inch of water at the bottom of my plate."}
{"text":"Wednesday lasagna is amazing. Salad is just plain iceberg with cheese. Dressing is good, bread is amazing. Bring your own wine, but it is served in plastic glasses. Get glasses please. Family owned, never had a bad meal here. Service is good. Pricing very fair. Carryout is also a nice touch. The packaging is well done. Pizza is old school."}
{"text":"Food always good Need to upgrade silverware Forks are really bad"}
{"text":"I just love their Italian wedding soup. I've only been disappointed once even it lacked its normal flavor. Meatball sub wasn't bad just didn't care for the sauce. The owner was very present."}
{"text":"Great family Italian restaurant with an extensive menu. Staff is prompt and friendly. Food portions are generous and very tasty. Mandolin player on Wednesday evening is a plus."}
{"text":"FYI if you do not want to read this long winded  review the last paragraph  sums it up. I really hate to give a 1 star review to mom and pop type of place, but this was well deserved.   Let start this by saying there was a blizzard going on and we did not want to drive any further. Lets try and find that next  mom and pop gem.  Were seated and our server immediately greeted us and brings us water with lemon and  fresh warm crusty bread nom nom. nom. We look around and the place is full of older people and teenagers. Seems like the type of place for a high school 1st date.   We started out with a big bowl of pasta fagioli. After one  taste of this i kind of knew this place may not be one of those mom and pop gems.  There was no flavor to the soup and half the pasta was cooked and half was a bit less than al dente.  On top of that it lukewarm.    The salad that we ate was typical iceberg lettuce, mozzarella wedge of tomato, and an olive. The salad dressing was pretty good.    The chicken parm, it was about 16$ and we ordered a side of meatballs with the pasta.    Lets start out- the size of the chicken was easily half of what you would get anywhere else. That's would have been OK except the sauce that it was swimming in was like a watered down version of ragu and had a sweet but bitter after taste. Missing were chunks of tomato and or a hint of garlic that most decent sauces posses. Its like they were using some type of canned pizza sauce.   The meatballs also were void of any flavor, I could see a bit of what appear to be some dry herbs in the meat, prepackaged meatballs would have been better.    Lastly it came time to pay the bill. I had checked in here on Yelp and to my surprise there was a 5 dollar off deal for checking in!. I go to redeem this and whom I imagine was the owner tells me that this is not his website and he does not pay Yelp and the discount is not honored. No big deal only 5$.   Congratulations you  now have learned the difference between 1 star and 2. When management is  rude, have really below average quality, poor value you deserve a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Had Lunch on Sat. With a Friend here. Both of us had salads to start. Very fresh with a nice Italian dressing. I had the veal parm sandwich and my friend had the sausage. Both served on delicious thick sliced Italian bread with a side of Maranara sauce. A good size sandwich and the veal was tender. Overall a good lunch."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sold Italian meal in a no frills environment, this is the place for you.   I stopped in for a quick dinner with my fiance and a friend who loves this place because of their veal parm sandwich. We were immediately served some warm, soft Italian bread as soon as we sat down. I asked the server my standard \"what's vegan to eat here\" questions, and she was very nice and knowledgeable. I ordered rigatoni in marinara sauce and my fiance ordered eggplant parm with a side of spaghetti. He enjoyed the eggplant, because, what's not to like about deep fried eggplant, but he thought the spaghetti was just ok. I felt the same way about my rigatoni. It was good, but the sauce wasn't the best I've ever had. Our friend mopped up every morsel on his  plate with his sandwich bread, so I'm assuming he enjoyed his sandwich.  The crowd here is definitely...older? Seems like a great place to take grandma or grandpa for a Sunday dinner. The food here is a heck of a lot better (and fresher) than anything you'd find at a chain, though, so I'd come to this place again before I'd step foot in, say, an Olive Garden."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the Lyndhurst/Mayfield/South Euclid.   Crust is good, sauce is great, toppings used are top notch.  They're not blazing trails in terms of inventing new types of pizza.  But if you want a traditional pepperoni and sausage pizza you can't beat it.  When I was in Vegas, I went to Grimaldi's at the Palazzo which supposedly is one of the Top 10 pizza places in the country.  They have nothing on Vicinato's.  The one knock on them is they don't deliver so plan on picking up or sitting down and ordering like a traditional restaurant.  It is definitely more of a sit down restaurant with carryout rather than the type of place centered around carryout and delivery."}
{"text":"Good food. Great waitresses (especially Shannon). She is always friendly and helpful. If you want a good Italian meal, check out Vicinato's!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wedding soup is the best ever. Pizza was perfectly cooked and delicious. Service was fast, efficient, and fun."}
