{"text":"These guys charged me more and asking me to come again for my refund and also food not so good on that day when we had."}
{"text":"The biryani here is really good (both chicken & lamb), definitely best in the north/north-central Phoenix area.   Apart from the biryani I've tried the combo curry plates, served with 2 curries, rice and naan. The curries were all delicious & there is a good range of vegetarian, chicken, lamb & daal selections. Only downside was that the curries were drenched in oil, which would dissuade me from eating these too often.   Overall the quality, quantity & price point make this a great value neighborhood joint, perfect for take out."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food in north Phoenix. The people who complain about this food and experience are upset about the authentic Indian parts. The family owned restaurant is authentic, delicious and the sweetest cook (o assume is the mom). Yum!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I wish I could give them 4 stars but there is a few kinks they need to work out. Seems like maybe this is their first restaurant? Regardless, the gentlemen that always takes our order is always smiling, very friendly young fellow who seems to be doing his best. Their food is AMAZINGLY delicious. Anyone who's saying it's a bit oily, it really isn't, just more traditional than most Americanized Indian food (which isn't bad either, just different).   I really like this place and hope to see it succeed!"}
{"text":"Pathetic food quality .. Extremely poor service and typically worse behavior .. Had terrible stomach upset after eating chicken here .. Owner seems to be extremely rude .."}
{"text":"Best Hyderbad Biryani in Phoenix!  Small restaurant so don't expect anything fancy. But if you want great food at great price with friendly staff this is the place. Lamb Korma and red daal were good as well."}
{"text":"Chicken Biryani is better than many other restaurants in the area. Lamb biryani not bad either. Less spicy, tasty !! Just dont like raw onions on top of hot biryani for to-go. Because when I come back home and open it, the smell is not that good."}
{"text":"Best place in the valley for Authentic Hyderabad Chicken Dum Biryani and trust me i am a Foodie by birth . The Deserts are also authentic too, this place is saving me from not leaving phoenix :) . Keep up the good work folks. Highly recommend the place to all the Desi folks...."}
{"text":"We love our Indian Food and were excited about a new place close to home.  Excitement lasted about 10 seconds after entering small space.  We waited a few minutes until someone finally game out, greeting was not sincere, somewhat frazzled staff.  The place was dirty, tables, bathroom, windows, counter, uck.  We ordered anyway in hopes that the food would be good but that did not go so well for us, they did not have chicken tikka masala, yikes, what Non-Veg indian place does not have chicken tikka masala???  Curry puff was pretty good and they did refund our money so not all was lost except time it took to find a place, order, and become disappointed in our choice."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place. I understand theyre a small new business. But there used to be a Chinese food here prior that flourished without a problem with only 1 cook.   I called ahead and ordered the vegetable biriyani. Gobi 65. And Chicken Tikka Masala this evening.   The guy came off as a bit rude it seemed. Because I asked him to repeat himself a few times. And I asked for the Chicken Tikka Masala as it is displayed on their menu, but he didnt know what I was talking about. But I enjoy the food so I continued. He took my order and told me itll be ready in 15 minutes. No worries. Instead it took him 30 and he lied to my face.  After he made my chicken masala and veggie biriyani, he told me they dont have gobi 65. Okayy.   I get home after paying. And open the biriyani. There's cauliflower in it. Really guy?  I get it when things are stressful, but this place is kinda off to a rough start. They don't display their correct hours anywhere but on their FB page. And they have it plastered on the front of the restaurant that they deliver when they don't.   I'm not sure who the guy was that was working tonight, but they should really have at least 3 people working everyday. One to cook. One to take orders and a back up. So I'm trying not to put the blame on him, but don't tell me you don't have an item, when ultimately you just don't want to make it.   I want to keep coming here because the food is really good, but if this keeps up I dont see this place lasting when Saffron is down the road. Atleast my Chicken tikka masala was, and the veggie biriyani were really tasty. I wouldnt know about the Gobi 65... :("}
{"text":"Excellent food . Huge portions. Homely food .family owned restaurant. Small place. Location like a diamond in the rough."}
