{"text":"Saw  the restaurants website and it was so appealing that i decided to give this place a try. Ordered 3 Turkish cheese burgers, 2 fries and two pops via 'skip the dishes'. The order arrived within 40 minutes however the fries were missing. I called the restaurant and told them about the missing item. The person who picked up was very sorry and offered to deliver fries as well as 3 complimentary burgers right away. Not a lot of restaurants respond like this these days. Truly made me feel like  \"home\". Exceptional customer service! The Turkish burgers and fries were really good. Probably the best Turkish burger in the area. I'll be dining in at this restaurant soon."}
{"text":"This is my go-to when I don't bring lunch to work as it is just across the street from me. It is a quaint little place, with authentic Turkish dishes made fresh every day. I gave it 4 stars just because I noticed that the portions are much smaller now than it was when it first opened. They also stopped making the orangey rice that I loved. However, I love how tender the chicken is--the meat falls off the bone. If you're ever in the area, you should give this place a try. It is quiet, has amazing food and the servers are really accomodating. Plus, they have Turkish coffee!"}
