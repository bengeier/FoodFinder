{"text":"The phone numbers are all wrong. Therefore its not possible to call and make reservation. Going there without one resulted in disappointment , it was full and full of discourtesy."}
{"text":"Food was well made and tasty albeit overpriced but I didn't mind as long as the food was up to par which it was for me. We ordered the toofani shrimp, behari kabab and goat karahi. Portion sizes are pretty small to compared to other places.  The service needs a lot of work as we literally had to ask multiple times for things like plates, utensils and water even though one guy was taking orders and it was quite busy. All in all, the place will work because of the delicious food and more servers/trained servers."}
{"text":"I didn't like the food here...it was very salty and over priced. I wouldn't recommend this place at all....the only item I liked was the gigantic naan but other than that the meat items were very dry n salty. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Namak Mandi Goat Karahi & Till (Sesame Seed) walay naan ..  so far so good .. i was along with a white buddy, who loves Pakistani food. It was a pleasant surprise to see a known chef, and i have tasted the quality of his food previously, at another location. The actual namak mandi karahi does not have yogurt as the base for gravy, but nevertheless, i am giving 4 points for the taste, service and overall ambiance. Certainly a place to go back to, to try other items.  Price wise .. they are steep .. hope they keep up the consistency to match the prices they are asking for .. price for a goat karahi is somewhat understandable, but ridiculous pricing for a chicken karahi ..  I'd say my comments and rating so far, are interim."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I was hungry and wanted something Pakistani at midnight and this place was open, delicious food, friendly staff and very clean and upscale. The menu was what they called a \"mini menu\" because they said it's a soft opening and next month they will launch full menu, but either way it was very delicious and open super late!"}
