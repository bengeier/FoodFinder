{"text":"One of my fave places to go with great lunch specials. The Hainan Chicken, Beef Brisket Curry, Lemongrass Chicken or Pork Chops w/ Rice, Beef Curry Noodles, Tomato Beef Noodles are some faves.  Small run place and owners are very kind. But service and the kitchen can be slow though so this is not a place to go to when in a rush. For a small place in a commercial plaza, it's very nicely decorated in simple way."}
{"text":"Came here a few times with big and small group. Food is actually pretty good, char grilled meat is always very tender and flavourful. Price is reasonable too. However very unhappy with the wait time. We ordered green curry chicken and char chilled chicken. Waited 15min for the curry which is reasonable, but the grilled chicken took 40min! I understand that grilled would take longer but they really should have waned us..."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review, which speaks to the lengths I will go to save people from this restaurant.  Tried 5 different things on the menu only to be further disappointed with each new dish. Food is neither authentic or tasty - way over salted and in some cases, just a strange kind of fusion (and not in a good way).  Service is horrendous, with dishes coming in at all different times. Must speak Chinese to get any kind of service. Also, someone needs to tell the staff that knives should not be used for pointing, especially at someone's face!"}
{"text":"Waste of Money.  Despite my better judgement I ordered the Singapore Laksa. Basically a very pricey chicken soup."}
{"text":"Decor is A rated, but then for a restaurant that's so secluded, it's a bit weird actually. It doesn't match the exterior. And you are certainly paying extra money for the decoration. 4 stars anyway ok.   Location is bad. This plaza is hard to access. If you missed the intersection, there's no other way but U-turn. 2.5 stars.   Parking is really bad. It's a Wednesday night, I had to go around the plaza twice to find a spot. It's believed that the spots were all taken by Kim Tao's customers, a hot pot restaurant next door. 1 star. Or is there a \"no star\"?  Serving... Three of the four items came around the same time, the fourth item, a curry, came after i had finished the laksa (noodle soup). I think this is what everyone hates the most I assume. 2 stars.   The first impression from the menu is, WHOA EXPENSIVE!!! And then..... WOW REALLY EXPENSIVE!!! Value wise, this place gets 2 stars.  Food... Pad Thai 3 stars. Laksa gets 2 stars unless the name is changed to \"laksa wannabe\". Hainan chicken rice 3.5 stars. Golden curry brisket 3.5 stars. Ok so food gets an average of 3 stars quality wise, but when the prices are factored in, boing boing.... down to 2 stars.  So 2.5 stars in general, but with this system there's no half a star, and I really would lose sleep if I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the plaza across from World Bowl!! Amazing food and friendly service! Ordered the combo for 4, LOVED their Indonesian chicken! The yellow curry beef brisket and pad Thai are really delicious too! Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about my experience today. High level,  I would say: 1. Great flavours 2. Expensive 3. Slow service  Flavours are delish. The heat in the Indonesian rice was on point and keeps you warm inside. The dipping sauce with the Gado Gado was so good we wanted more!   East Asian food should not cost a lot of money - but this place is a little above comfortable. The price is justified by calling the platter a family share portion - and it was far from it.  Small business owners are definitely stretched and the staff are trying to turn dishes quickly onto tables but it felt like a drawn out experience. We ordered 3 dishes for dinner and each of them arrived with a 5-7 min gap btwn them and so they were not enjoyed together as a meal.  The food was great but the rest outwieghs the need to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Not good.   Called for take out. my order is 2x hainanese chicken, 1x laksa, 1x chicken wings, 1x indo fried rice and 1x stir fried veggie. I had to wait for 50 mins for my order and was told last minute that they didn't hv time to cook my fried rice.  Service was not the only problem. It's soooo bland, no heat, no salt just flat. And it's pretty over price consider its location and small portions. Won't go back."}
{"text":"S'alright  Friday lunch had only 4 parties, never a great sign. We ordered Red and Green Curry, they were a 6/10. The soup was pretty good, although a portion almost enough for a parakeet.  Service was very friendly, they definately wanted to ensure a good experience. So it all comes down to how you like your Curry..."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago, considering the lack of indonesian/malaysian restaurants in the GTA this came off as being good. It is a shame that their location is in a slight depression making it very difficult to notice this restaurant if you aren't paying attention.  I ordered the green seafood curry with a large spiciness factor, they managed to make it decently spicy. The distribution of seafood in the curry was good and the texture was on the firm side could have been left on the stove a bit longer but it is acceptable. I got the chicken skewers which were a modified form of sate. they claimed it would be very spicy, but I found it was maybe a medium at most. As for the drink I chose to get the mango milk shake (it was a while ago so I'm not sure what it was called on the menu) and I found this to be quite good if a bit too sweet.   Obviously due to the lack of density, the price of making these foods is higher considering the serving sizes. The overall price for the lunch combo was ~$15.   Overall, I would go here again. I can only hope that there is an expansion of this food niche to bring the prices down."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 6 and we were the first group to be seated. At around 6:30 we placed our order so granted we ordered late. We ordered 6 dishes in total and 2 soups. By 7:30 we only received 2 soups and 2 dishes. One hour after placing our order. The vegetable dish we ordered was wrong so we sent it back. They even told us to pay for the dish even though it was wrong. The curry dish had a HAIR in it. The roti came almost 30mins before the curry and in the end was cold. We sent that back to be reheated... Not a new one.   The first time we came here a year ago, it was fine. I really enjoyed myself. This place must have taken a turn for the worse.   It is now 7:45 and they finally got our vegetable dish right. All the other food was eaten so we're just eating boiled vegetables."}
{"text":"SERVICE : They're all fairly nice except for one of the older ladies who is quite rude and trash talks about the customers in Cantonese. If you don't know Chinese, communication is very hard as they'll try to ignore you because they don't know English.   FOOD : The food was very good! I got the dinner special for 2 for $30! I recommend asking to substitute the curry with their hainanese chicken dish, you just have to ask. I've had the curry before and it's only worth getting if you order their roti."}
{"text":"They have a decent lunch menu here, but the biggest beef is that they always seem to run out of their specials. They have a fantastic crispy chicken that is never in stock, and a really delicious coconut curry chicken that also is never available. When you can get it, it's awesome. When you can't, you wonder why you keep trying to come back to this place.  The laksa is decent, but they seem to use some pretty fancy looking dishes which immediately makes my meal look smaller than I'd like it to be. A laksa to me is a pretty homey dish, so for the portion to be small makes me sad. Same goes with their soups. The flavour is amazing, but the portions are small :( Their mango salad is pretty spot on though, and it comes with a lot of things as a small side.  Their lunch specials are a good price for what you get, and the service is very friendly here. The place fills up quickly during lunch and dinner, and it seems people call in advance to reserve some crispy chicken, so you best do the same when you stop by!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us came here on a Friday for lunch.  They had trouble getting all the orders served at the same time. Two people in our group had finished before the remaining 4 dishes arrived. Also, 2 of the starters arrived after the main courses arrived.  On top of that, they got two of the orders wrong after 40 minutes of waiting. The food itself was passable, but it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK! The decor is nice, service is alright, but the food didn't seem that authentic, more like a Chinese down-played version. The good thing is that they have these dinner specials that come with soup, app, entree and dessert. Which was a pretty good deal.   Let's just start of with the good. The soup: coconut chicken, seems good, good flavour, coconut milk, and some curry lemongrass flavour, have bits of chicken in it, a decent portion. App: chicken skewers, COMES with TWO! Juicy meat, but the satay sauce really lacking flavour, watery and tasteless, not like the traditional peanut sauce I'm used to. Mango salad was okay as well, except it had cilantro, which I hate. Okay, now for the entree I ordered the Singapore laksa. I love laksa, usually full of flavours, have curry soaked tofu, various meats and two types of noodles. I haven't had authentic authentic laksa in Singapore or surrounding countries, but I feel like I've had my fill of laksas to know what they should taste like. AND this was NOT it. The curry soup had no flavor, really no flavor not even coconut or curry powder nothing (It had colour though weirdly). Therefore the tofu and meat inside would not have any flavour either. The soup is the most important. The chicken and shrimp seemed like they were soaked in some chemical to either \"marinate\" it or preserve it and it altered the texture, tasted funny to me. The egg noodle was soggy. Overall I thought it was a terrible laksa, maybe it was a passable chicken soup noodle.   I mean overall the decor is okay, it's clean, the service was good. Although the food was really slow tonight. Also the meal comes with a small red bean, kidney bean, coconut dessert soup, which was nice. But if you like laksa, don't order it. I heard the chicken and pork chop rice was good, from my dinnermates."}
{"text":"I like how they make and present their Hainanese Chicken and Golden curry beef brisket.   Lunch specials include a choice of soup, mango salad or spring rolls...all well prepared.  Call me a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Walking into to the restaurant, you are welcomed with a clean, nicely designed and friendly staff. Compared to other restaurants at similar price points, this place was quite impressive in decor. In terms of food, I found it to be good. It wasn't spectacular, but I would come back again. I found that there wasn't too much msg in their food and it was clean tasting, though others may interpret that as being bland. I liked that the server took the time to wait to bring us our milk teas at the end instead of throwing them on the table like most places immediately. I ordered fhe beef and tomato noodles. The beef was tender and the tomatoes were actually peeled! I wasnt expecting that. Overall, this was a nice quiet place that was very comfortable and good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The Singapore Laksa arrived in a tilted bowl, which looked nice, but it meant that there were fewer contents in it because if there were a lot, it would have spilled out on the side.  There were two types of noodles in the laksa -- a vemicelli-type and a yellow thick noodle.  This wasn't authentic Singapore Laksa.  The broth was creamy but wasn't even spicy enough.  There was one shrimp, two pieces of fish, some chicken chunks, and tofu puffs in total in the bowl.  The soup broth also wasn't hot enough -- tasted lukewarm.  This was just not a good \"Singapore Laksa\" at all.  It was like a watered down and Chinese-style version of what the real thing should have been.  They ran out of the \"Aromatic Soy Chicken with rice\" so I ordered the \"Char-grilled Lemongrass Chicken\" instead.  The chicken was served separately from the rice and I actually really liked the Char-grilled lemongrass chicken.  It was very meaty, moist, tender, and crispy on its grilled parts.  It went well with the watery peanut sauce too.  The rice was slightly flavoured and had some dried fruit in it as well.  This item tasted decent but for $10.99, I'm not sure if it was really worth it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here for lunch with the family and we enjoyed it. The menu didn't really seem Indonesian, and I don't know if anything was particularly authentic, but I thoroughly enjoyed my Singapore laksa and would order it again. The soya chicken and crispy chicken were also very yummy. The milk tea was delicious, but when my husband tried to order another, they had run out. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the spring rolls - seemed like they had come from a frozen package."}
{"text":"The tea here are very good. The good is very good. And the price is very good. I will come again and again. It's harder to find but its worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is alright. I've been here a couple of times for lunch because it's close to where I work, it's cheap, and it's quick.  The service is a hit or miss depending on which server you get. I always see the same employees there each time I visit. One Asian lady is always really nice and approachable where as the other older Asian lady is the opposite. I specifically remember one instance where I asked for a split bill, the older Asian lady pretty much said no and wouldn't allow it... She was very rude and awkward about it. Not sure why, as I've had no troubles splitting bills before in past visits (with the other server).   The food is decent. I've tried a few of the lunch specials: curry dishes, pad thai, and Singapore laksa. They are all generously portioned with great prices. Nothing really stood out to me too much but you get what you pay for. My favourites would be the green and golden curry dishes as they have much more flavour than the others. I would not recommend the Singapore laksa - this was super bland and just didn't taste good in my opinion.   Overall, I would probably come back even though I'm not the biggest fan just because it's convenient for me. You can get a pretty good deal here, especially during lunch hours!"}
{"text":"3.5  Came with a large group. We didn't all fit at one table, so we had two tables next to one another. The tables were really close together. It was quite awkward trying to get in and out from between them. Service was spotty - owner was delightful, but some of the servers gave us attitude. One of them also announced very loudly to the entire restaurant (in the middle of our meal) that the restaurant was out of all chicken dishes except Hainanese chicken. Um...not okay.  Had:  Fish soup - fish broth with papaya. Tasted like fish. 'nuff said. Coconut chicken soup - something like that. Standard stuff. Mango salad - not as sour as some other mango salads I've had. That's a point in my book. I don't like sour mangoes. Also slivers of red onions and stuff. And cilantro. Indonesian chicken - I think that's what it was called. Super crispy skin. Chicken was tender, but not super tender. A tad too salty. Big pieces of chicken though. Wish they had been cut smaller. Served with peanut sauce. Grilled pork chops - also served with peanut sauce. Nothing special, but good. Meatballs in broth - yep. Meatballs floating around in broth. Also some kind of Chinese veggie. I forget what kind. Pad Thai - good stuff. Wish I had more than one mouthful. Will note on this later. Pineapple fried rice - not bad. Couldn't find the pineapple in my two mouthfuls though. There was seafood though. Pork hock - some kind of gingery, sweet pork hock. Not as strong as the ginger/vinegar stuff that Chinese people eat after someone has a baby. Probably my favorite dish of the night, and the reason this restaurant isn't being given a 3 star rating. Green curry chicken - Didn't have this. Heard it was spicy. Some kind of shrimp stew - good sized shrimp. Heads still on. Super shrimpy sauce. Yum. Yellow curry brisket - either yellow curry or Malaysian curry. Quite enjoyed this one. Have had it better at other places, but not many other places. Also tendon. I like tendon. Also small chunks of potatoes. Pomfret with thick coconut sauce - coconut sauce wasn't thick. More like creamy than thick. We ended up drinking the sauce after we ate the fish. Tasted creamy, coconutty, and fishy. Pomfret with tofu- ubiquitous brown sauce. Good stuff.  Drinks: Mango coconut drink - lots of fresh mango taste. No coconut. Yeah...not impressed. If I wanted straight up mango, I'd have ordered the mango juice. Indonesian tea with condensed milk - had a bit of difficulty ordering this one. That's its actual name on the menu. When ordered in English, it caused a lot of confusion. In Cantonese, which the owner had to clarify with the server, they just called it milk tea. Cuz they only have one kind of milk tea. Yeah. Apparently, the waiter didn't know it was milk tea. Taste-wise, it was delightful at the beginning; even a tad sweet. Definitely tasted the condensed milk. Then, as I got to them middle, it just tasted like milk tea. No more condensed milk taste. =(  So we came with 15 people (2 of them were kids). We ordered 2 meals for 5 people, and we ordered 4 other main dishes. We also ordered extra soup. We ate EVERYTHING. Absolutely no leftovers. Portions aren't very big. I actually left about 55-60% full.   Free dessert was a sweet soup with red bean and other stuff in it. Small dishes, more like saucers than bowls.  I'll come again to give it another go (my parents are big fans, and we got 10% off VIP cards), but right now, this is where I stand."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem in richmond hill! Not an avid visitor of thai restaurants, I was so happy to find this one in my area, even though it's been around for awhile.  Restaurant has nice aesthetic and it's clean, unlike a lot of asian-run restaurants. The staff are really quick, attentive and friendly. I was offered a vegetable coconut curry noodle after they found out I don't eat meat, and it wasn't even on the menu! So much appreciation for people like this. The dish was piping out, and came in a good portion. Enough to make me full, not too much so I didn't have to waste. The noodle looked so good that the person sitting in the table beside actually asked us what it was.  Generally a great place in richmond hill and if you're a local, definitely check it out! It's so worth it."}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant with some of the best service around. They are a small restaurant with limited staff but everyone there is warm and welcoming. The food is by fair some of the best south asian cuisine around. The beef brisket curry is out of this world."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend my friends to bring her family to Bali for dinner.  Many set dinner are quite nice.  We order Set for 4 tonight.  Grilled chicken and/or Hoi Nan Chicken are the Bali's signature dish."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, always on a Sunday afternoon. I'd say generally after coming here for over 3 months that it's consistent. It's not spectacular but it's decent. Many people say it's really salty, but I've never found that, I must have some high tolerance.  Today I had the beef brisket with noodle soup. Basically this is Vietnamese Pho with beef brisket. You're gonna get 5 or 6 pieces of brisket on top of Vietnamese noodles with onions and noodles. It was alright for $6.99, but I think you get more by going to a Pho restaurant.  I've had the fish in tomato soup noodle, it's not really tomato soup, but tomatoes in soup. I quite like this one actually, it tastes like how you'd imagine tomatoes in soup.   Overall I always found the this place good value, portions aren't big but neither are the prices.  The milk tea that comes with the noodle soups are very strong and sweet at the same time, strong meaning a lot of tea flavor. And while I think it tastes good, I always feel like it's a little small.  I keep coming back, so I must be ok with it. There are other items like the laksa and pad thai which all look like decent enough with no complaints."}
{"text":"I went with my family (4 ppl) and we all loved it! We ordered the combo for 4 and it was just the right amount, maybe even more than enough.  We all got to choose our own bowl of soup (3 options: tong yum gong, coconut chicken, papaya fish). Had a plate of mango salad, roasted chicken (the skin was so crispy!), pad thai, beef curry w/ rice, pineapple fried rice.   The roasted chicken, pad thai, and fried rice was on point the curry was not that special in comparison It also came with a small bowl dessert soup at the end and we rly liked that too.  Our final bill was about $67"}
{"text":"This is one of the little restaurants that have opened up around the Beaver Creek business area that pretty much exclusively cater's to the business crowd.  I'm pretty sure they've opened recently.  First thing upon entering, they're decor is pretty damn nice.  I mean, fresh out of an ikea catalog and everything brand new.  Guess they did just open recently.  I ordered the beef satay's, beef curry, and a singapore soup noodle thing.  We also had a \"chow gwei diew\" on the table as well (sorry, have no idea what this actually was on the menu).  The meals also came with a soup which was a \"tom yum gong\" soup.  This was meh, a little too sour for my taste, but I guess this is how it's supposed to be.  I'm not really a giant fan of that soup.  The beef satay seemed like it was tenderized way too much to the point where it felt like I was eating chicken.  The singapore soup noodle thing was ok, it wasn't anything special.  It was kinda neat that they used clear glass noodles as well as vermicelli, but other than that, I've had better.  The \"chow gwei diew\" which was kinda like a tomato based pad thai kind of thing was BRUTAL.  I mean, it only took one whiff to know that the thing had about half a cup of ketchup in it.  Not good.  We didn't have more than 2 bites of this stuff.   Now I'm not really one for service, but this place didn't have any.  It's like the people that operated it just all of a sudden started up a restaurant without knowing how to run it or serve people.  I'm talking about waiting 30 minutes between dishes coming out and leaving dishes all over the place.  Am I ever coming back?  Nope."}
{"text":"Friendly staff - good service.  TOM YUM SOUP 4/5 Not too spicy, I think I'd choose this as my favourite thing on the menu.  MANGO SALAD 4/5 I want to know what sauce they use to make this! I love this! Makes a great appetizer to start off your meal  BEEF SKEWERS 2.5/5 The meat is a little too soft - they might have marinated the beef too long?   BEEF BRISKET CURRY RICE 1/5 I'd prefer if they add more coconut milk broth onto the curry. The curry they had was on the bitter end (for some odd reason..?). It actually reminded me of Chinese herbal medicines.. I don't like this at all :S  JAJA (DESSERT) 3/5 Mmm this was good! It was warm when we got this, would've tasted better if it was hot - but the flavour makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this place. If you came here to get authentic Indo/Malay food, you're going to be disappointed. Very disappointed unfortunately. If you've never had authentic Indo/Malay food, what the heck. Give this place a try. My party had a few dishes. The chicken satay was grilled. Juicy. Weak peanut sauce. Watery. I don't know what to call their Singapore laksa, except it's not laksa. Absolutely no flavor. No spice. Well not the right spices. Large chicken pieces. And cucumbers. Who makes laksa with cucumbers? The oxtail soup was flavorful. Had a good portion of meat too. Also good portion of carrots and celery. I suspect the broth wasn't real tomato based but ketchup based. I cant really give this place a good rating but there was a decent crowd so the food is appealing to some."}
{"text":"Came here before 12 on a Sunday. Seated right away  We ordered the lunch sets One pad Thai with green mango salad and one hainan chicken rice with spring rolls  My green mango salad came first it tasted very strong! Not necessarily a bad thing..... And it doesn't look like green mango to me? I don't know..... Spring roll was standard. Good that it's piping hot.  On to the main course My pad Thai..... It's actually one of the best that I've tasted. The noodles was al dente, chicken wasn't dry, appropriate amount of sourness, can use more shrimps though. So I really like it! But hainan chicken was disappointing. Not only did it take super long to come out (maybe ten minutes after I've finished my pad Thai, yeah so my friend watched me eat and I watched him eat...), but it also didn't taste great. Bland, not hot enough. Almost feel like it's microwaved.... My frd also said the grated ginger that came with the rice was bland and just salty but not fragrant.  So he won't be coming again......  I wanna come again but maybe not by myself.  Btw it seems like they have 10% off if pay by cash."}
{"text":"I've been here for both the lunch and dinner specials and it has been delicious both times.   The specials are great as they usually come with appetizers, main course and dessert.   I would definitely recommend all of the appetizers.  Tom Yum Soup  -One of the best tom yum soups I've had. Quite flavourful and just enough spice.   Beef/Chicken Skewer -Great with the peanut sauce they supply   Mango Salad -Refreshing especially if you've ordered a hot meal. I personally found it great right after having the Tom Yum Soup  Everytime I've been to this restaurant I've ordered the Singapore Laksa and I would recommend it for those who go to the restaurant. It's the first item on the dinner special menu and there's seafood, noodles and vegetables mixed in the broth. However, something I was disappointed with was the order the food came in. For some reason my Singapore Laksa came first before our appetizers and my friend's main dish.  My other friend usually orders the curry and that took a while to make.   Something we were not aware of was the different types of curry there was. The first time, my friend ordered the red/yellow curry which was just enough spice. This time she thought she would try the green curry and it was super spicy! It might be great for those who can really handle super spicy but it was too strong for my taste too. We were not aware the green curry was the \"spiciest\" of all the curry and wish the server had told us. We had to get a couple of glasses of water after that. Eventually, we told one of the servers it was too spicy and she made it less spicier when we took it to go and offered us dessert."}
{"text":"Authentic Indonesian or not, I am a fan of the Bali Restaurant  Reason #1:  Nice and relaxing ambiance.  The colours white and dark brown are the theme colours in both the interior decoration and the plate setting (see pictures).  The design is clean, bright, contemporary, yet unpretentious.  White furniture can be tricky if it is not kept clean.  Bali does a fabulous job in keeping the white furniture bright and sparkle.  I think Bali can be an inexpensive date restaurant for dinner.  This has scored a big plus with my BF.  Reason #2:  Reasonably priced lunch combos with reasonable portion.  We ordered a beef noodle, a pad thai, and a golden curry dish from the lunch special menu.  All the dishes had sufficient portion for lunch.  My mom said her beef noodle tasted good.  The golden curry dish was spicy.  It was my second favourite dish of the meal.  It will be our go-to curry from now on.  The pad thai tasted okay/average.  I liked that it didn't taste like ketchup, and it was not saucy.  The best dish, however, was the complimentary tom yam soup.  It tasted complex, herbal, and it had heat.  Mom totally loved it.  Reason #3:  Services was friendly and polite.  We arrived early, so the restaurant wasn't busy.  Needless to say, the food arrived quickly.  Pet Peeve: I consider the cuisine here as South East Asian instead of Indonesian.  This is because most of the choices in the lunch menu are not Indonesian."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon. The place was fairly busy. Small and cozy place run by Chinese.   Lunch comes with option of soup, spring rolls or mango salad. We went with the mango salad. They loaded it with sugar so it tasted really sweet but other than that it was pretty average.   Green curry with beef and rice $9.99 - the curry had a nice kick of spiciness to it. The beef was more like beef tendon. The sauce tasted decent with the rice. Nothing spectacular though.  Oxtail in wine sauce with rice $14.99 -  oxtail was not that tender and was cut really small. Pretty disappointed in the dish. If you want good oxtail dish then try the one at Fav Cafe.  Overall a pretty average place for a meal."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night with my dad and there were a few tables filled. I ordered the dinner combo with Tom yum soup, chicken skewers and the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. My dad ordered the hainan chicken and rice also with Tom yum soup and beef skewers instead.   The Tom yum soup was nice and hot with a good amount of spicy and sour taste. My dad and I had one of each of the chicken and beef skewers which were delicious along with the peanut sauce that came with it. The pad Thai I got had a good flavour but the noodles were just slightly harder than I would've liked. I'm not sure if they can do it spicy as I forgot to ask but I think a little heat would've made it even better. I tried the chicken from my dads dish which was juicy and delicious as well. He said the rice was also very aromatic and went along with the chicken great. They also gave complimentary dessert. A little bowl of sago dessert soup with red bean and some other stuff (ja ja in Chinese).   Overall the food was definitely good. The service was also good. The ladies were helpful and friendly although when my dad's dish came there was a little piece of hair in it. The waitress apologized and was going to change it but my dad said it was fine and just didn't eat the piece that touched the hair (I think he was hungry...). They gave us a 10% discount on the bill as well which I wasn't expecting. The total came to about $29 which was reasonable for the amount of food. I will def be back to try the curry and Indonesian chicken that other Yelpers talked about."}
{"text":"My parents and I love Singapore/ Thai food - and through their friend's recommendation, we have decided to give Bali restaurant a try! The staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere/ overall cleanliness of the place are fairly good. We looked into the menu and were quite shocked at the prices - but that did not stop us from ordering, as we are strong believers that if the food and service excel customers' expectation, then the premium on the price will be worth it.  Unfortunately, we do not see how the quality of the food and service can justify their over priced menu: 1. A simple Singapore styled chicken and rice would take them 45 mins to prepared, and a grilles pork chop rice take longer... 2. The combo of chicken and rice really do not taste any different than any other places... not bad, but not good either 3. The soups are nothing special, especially when you have tried authentic Thai soup elsewhere, you can tell the difference"}
{"text":"30 for 30:  I'm surprised by all the low reviews for this place.  Let's start with what we ate. The 7 of us ordered a set meal that included: -Tom yum soup with shrimp- decent -Mango salad- great start! One of the best dishes. Very fresh -Indonesian style chicken- didn't try it -Pepper shrimp- ok -Chicken curry- didn't try -Pork neck- didn't try -Vietnamese rice noodles- these were ok but my aunt had raved about them (from a previous visit here) so they didn't quite live up to those expectations -Chinese broccoli -Red bean dessert soup- passed on this. Never been a fan  We paid extra for the skewer platter which was attractive and delicious.  We also ordered a laksa. Unfortunetely, it came with chicken but I just picked it out.  The set meal is a great deal and was suggested to be for 6. With the laksa and skewer platter, we had more than enough food.  The main problem is that there's not much of a kick to the spice factor considering its Southeast Asian food.  Also, I would have given this 4 stars, but my aunt found a piece of metal netting in her soup. Fail. MAJOR fail.  I understand this doesn't always happen but I suggest the restaurant work on their safety regulations and add a little more kick to their food.  If those things could be fixed, we might have ourselves a winner."}
{"text":"As suggested, I went back to try more of the menu. Still 3 stars.  The place was empty near closing time on a Saturday night, much unlike some of the other nearby restaurants. Bad sign.  The soup was excellent and exactly as I remembered it from the first visit. Lemongrass chicken was a juicy grilled whole boneless thigh that was simply perfect. That's it for the good.  \"Beef\" satay skewers were overcooked and were either of some of the worst beef I've ever had or were from some related roadkill variety. Sauce was the same watery thing from the last time. Volcano chicken skewers were pre-cooked fried chicken pieces covered in an incredibly spicy sauce; not pleasant.  Unfortunately, it seems as though there isn't the turnover here for all things on the menu to be prepared fresh or from top ingredients. Avoid side skewers, which come with any and all combination deals. Service is also sub-par, difficult to get a server's attention even with being the only table."}
{"text":"The food and service were decent/good.  Tom Yum Goong Soup: It had a good balance of sweet, spicy and tartness with sliced mushrooms and decent size shrimps.  Mango Salad: It had julienne red peppers, red onions, mango and cilantro - quite refreshing  Hainanese Chicken with Rice: The chicken were decent and boneless which was great. The sauce however was lacking salt and spice. The chicken oil rice was decent, not the best I've had.  Chicken Green Curry: If you're a coconut fan and love your spice, then this is your dish. This dish has a lot of chickens, peppers and bamboo shoots that can be shared amongst 2 people.  Overall, I will definitely come back and try their Indonesian Fried Rice, for I saw the table next to me ordering it and it looked great with the shrimp chips and a fried egg!"}
{"text":"Bali has steadily become worse.  They have to realize that:  1.  adding that much salt into the food does not equal better flavouring. 2.  if your client can't speak Chinese when he entered the building, it doesn't matter if you keep trying to speak Chinese to him, even by the end of the service he will still not understand a word you're saying. 3.  it's advisable to give the included dessert BEFORE handing out the bill 4.  it's advisable to give the included dessert without being asked... twice 5.  it's advisable that after such a horrible service, don't assume that I don't need change when I give you $40 when the bill is only $31  I've been there about 5 times.  It's gotten worse literally every time I visited the place.  avoid it at all cost."}
{"text":"It had been 5 years since I last visited Bali Restaurant. And it is still a 3 star experience.  If you want value, lunch combo is the way to go. We shared:  Golden Curry Beef Brisket with Rice ($8.99) - A lot of curry Char Grilled Lemongrass Pork Chop with Rice ($8.99) - Great Portion with 2 Chops Aromatic Soy Chicken with Rice ($8.99) - Meh, Chicken has this funny texture and bland Pad Thai ($8.50) - Meh Pork Meat Balls with Rice Vermicelli in Broth ($8.50) - OK  Mango Salad - Meh Spring Roll - Fresh and Crispy  My previous review still stands. If you here for authentic South East Asian food, you will be disappointed. Missing the intense flavour and the extensive use of herbs and spices. You find most of the clients here are Chinese and quite a lot of seniors during lunch hours.  But if you here for just some filling food then you will be OK."}
{"text":"Laksa , Indonesia rice, hai nan chicken rice... if you have an asian favor, then you should come. My laksa was below average but the Indonesia fried rice was yummy"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in their food even after giving the place a try about 3 to 4 times over several years. The most recent visit prompted me to write this review.  How can they run out of their signature chicken dishes for dinner time? I was forced to order something else despite the fact that I went there just for their hainan chicken rice.   Their singapore laksa was very watered down and had little scraps of veggies and meat. For the price, I expected more than that.   The only good thing I can say is that the service was good and the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Bali Restaurant... Being Indonesian, how could I not try a restaurant called Bali? I was hoping to find some familiar foods but it turns out that this place is more of a fusion restaurant with Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian-inspired dishes.   Since we were a group of 4, we went along with their higher-priced set course for 4. We tried one of each soup - tom yum and coconut chicken. I liked the tom yum but I found the coconut chicken soup a bit too salty. Unfortunately, the saltiness continues throughout the rest of the meal with the fish, the curry, and the chicken dishes. Saltiness aside, the roast chicken had a nice crispy skin and I enjoyed the whole fish dish with veggies.  Service is actually pretty nice, although some servers were hard to communicate with in English. The Owner came around and spoke to each of the tables and I found out she's from Macau and the cook is Thai. She asked how everything was and she seemed to genuinely want to know so I told her that the food was on the salty side. She was gracious about the comment and said she would mention it to the chef which I appreciate.   They were quite busy on the Thanksgiving Monday dinner and seemed to have lots of regulars dropping in. Not sure if I would come back often but I wish them well and think they have a good customer base."}
