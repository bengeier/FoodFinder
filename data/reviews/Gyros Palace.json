{"text":"Sometimes I feel like I am almost defending neighborhood, independent establishments in my reviews.  It's a bit unfair to hold small, focused shops to the same standards as full-blown restaurants.  They are not quite fast-food, but they aren't always bastions of fine dining either.
With that said, Gyros Palace delivers a decent gyro at a decent price without a whole lot of waiting around.  Whenever my family is in the mood for a quick lunch that's not fast-food, this is one of the places we choose.  The last time we got take out at Gyro Palace was on the way to a Phoenix Coyotes game, and it was great."}
{"text":"I was not at all thrilled with the food here. I found there to be a lack of choices for my tastes, but it may also be me being new to Greek food.  The food was kind of bland, but it was prepared fast and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time and decided to give it a try.  I never had a Gyro before so I can't compare it to anything.  The order board was overwhelming and packed with so many items. I went with the standard gyro and french fries.  I took a take out menu to read later.  The two guys behind the counter were very nice and helpful.  The gyro tasted amazing and was huge!  For me it was two meals because it was so packed with meat I couldn't finish it.  The fries were just so so and next time I will try the garlic or sweet potato fries.  I gave them 5 stars because it was the gyro that was so delicious and never having one or tzatziki sauce before I will be sure to return again!"}
{"text":"The Gyros plate is awesome. The included salad was fresh and very tasty. Love the rice. Good meal for the $$$."}
{"text":"Easily the Best Gyros in Arizona. The Tzatziki Sauce is really what puts it on top. I even dunk my fries in it. I've tried several other Gyros places and Gyro Palace is King!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum had the chicken philly it was amazing  they have amazing customer service staff is always so nice and the Resturant is always clean their Cesear salad is just incredible I always leave satisfied if you haven't checked this place out I highly recommend you do and tell the world about it support your locals"}
{"text":"Since I don't eat mammal anymore, I don't normally go to Gyro shops, but I have to admit that Gyro's are one thing I miss. My other half just misses them because it's hard to find a good Gyro out near us, so we had to check out this place. Went there two days, and she had a Gyro each time. She said it would last her until we see her family in Chicago next year, which is to say it was a really good Gyro. There's a painting of the Chicago skyline on one wall, so one presumes that there's a connection between Gyros and Chicago, and this place apparently makes it like she's used to from back there. I had the Falafel Pita and it was extremely tasty. Between the two days, they seemed to go through a lot of lamb, so it seems to have a lot of fans. Likewise, both days around lunch, seating was tight.

The staff was nice, food was good, prices reasonable, establishment was clean. It's not five-star dining, but if you're looking for a Gyro or related cuisine for a quick bite, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Great Gyro lot of meat  great bread got takeout for my wife and mother in law they had the grilled chicken salad was excellent as wel pita bread is the bomb. The falafel was decent could use some work. I have a gyro place closer to my house but Yelp rates the Palace better. Prices are fair but not amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I'm craving Greek food! It's near my house and very convenient. Their food is delicious and I love the style inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a friendly family owned business with wonderful sandwiches.  
What really sets them apart is the buns.  I am so tired of the same dried buns.  These are soft and really hug the sandwich.  I tried the Philly cheesesteak sandwich which was actual shaved steak. It was so tender and flavorfull. The fries were crispy and the staff was very helpful with the menu.  I will be back soon for the gyros."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and was in town to watch MLB Spring Training and drove by this place so I decided to try it since I was in the mood for a gyros. The decoration of the lakefront in Chicago indicated to me that the owner lived in Chicago. The gyros I got was anything but Chicago. It was very bland and small. Just another place cheap on quality and quantity. Will not come here again when I'm in town this weekend to watch more MLB Spring Training."}
{"text":"This place has probably one of the best gyros I've tried not to mention the fact that they bring up my hometown in Chicago since that's where they came from,  not trying to be biased or anything but they also have other foods based off of Chicago like gyros chicago dogs pastrami and Philly cheesesteaks. Just a suggestion if it's your first time there then get the gyros."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a little hole-in-the-wall place with a relatively small menu packed with huge flavor and top-notch quality food!! I don't know anything about Greek food, but I do know about deliciousness.  It's so good, my friend renamed it \"Yum-yum\".  Don't miss out, go get a gyro today!"}
{"text":"Eaten here many times and enjoyed most of there food.  Just wish the prices would come down some and they use different types of Frys."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Food is delicious and clean. I have been there numerous times and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's a small place so no wait staff or anything.... so maybe not a \"palace\" but most of the food here is pretty good. Sandwiches are juicy or greasy depending on how you like them, and I get the Gyro plate every once in awhile and it's pretty good as well"}
{"text":"Great Gyro! Service is consistently good. Nice mom and pop run place."}
{"text":"If this review was strictly on their food, they would get between 4.5 and 5 stars. However their customer service sucks. If you go in there, and you look around and realize you are the only one there, do you understand what I'm talking about. The food is awesome, well cooked, and even will presented. I just wish they would do something about the customer service, because as of today the nearest gyro place is 15 minutes further, but I think I will be going there instead."}
{"text":"I go here ever time I'm in the area, I gave Gyros Palace a 4 star a few year ago and I have now changed it to a 5 star, because the service has picked up, I can now say that everytime I go here to enjoy great food I am greeted with a hello and a smile, Thank you Gyros Palace for you for your great food and your awesome customer service :) Keep up the Good work..."}
{"text":"This place has the best Greek food!  I get the Greek salad with chicken and it's so good--fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and feta with a homemade dressing.  Hummus is also fresh and delicious!  Pita bread is excellent. I go there weekly after my daughter's swim class. It's a great place to eat fast, yet healthfully."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for sometime but did not have a chance to check it out until this week.  Luckily I was there during non lunch rush hours so I was able to get my food very quickly.  The staff were very pleasent and the food very good.  The gyros were seasoned very well and the sauce was good.  I definitely would recommend and be back."}
{"text":"Good but pricey - have found other places just as good and more affordable . Still, great if you're in the area looking for a gyro or Greek salad !"}
{"text":"We'd just left a Dr appt, I was craving greek. This was closest. So glad. I had the classic gyro, mom had greek salad with chicken. Both were great. I was able to sub salad for the default fries (this always me feel self-impressed, 'cuz the fries looked awesome).  This little gem is on my way home from work, I'll definitely be back. Guy at the counter was great, also"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros! Generous portions of meat. I live in Prescott but make a point to stop by if I'm in the neighborhood for lunch. Highly recommend it for either gyros (what I go for) or hot dogs. Well worth the $7 and investment in a local business."}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak bread was soggy :( Fries were the crinkle cut kind, which I didn't care for.. My boyfriend ordered them Greek style and they were also soggy. He didn't care for his gyro, and he loves Greek food so that says a lot. Maybe it was just what we ordered, it was our first time here but we won't be returning. Service was good and food came out fast. Limited seating as it's pretty small and I went around lunch time."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food! I've had the gyro, greek salad and fries, and hubby had the italian combo sandwich, which is italian sausage covered with italian beef, cheese and peppers. It was all amazing. The italian combo sandwich is huge! Hubby said he thinks it may be the best sandwich he has ever had. We definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was in the area & was craving some Greek food. I looked up Gyro Palace on Yelp and it had 4 Stars so I went. When I came in, the ambiance was typical of a Gyro place. 

I ended up ordering the Chicken Pita Gyro with a side of Garlic Fries. The gyro was average in my opinion. The sauce they put on the garlic fries was very good, but they put too much on the fries. I would personally ask them to put a little less or to put it on the side and pour on/dip myself!

In the end, I was satisfied with my meal and would give it an average rating."}
{"text":"Ever met anyone who has never tried a gyro? And they don't want to invest money in something they've never tried because they aren't open to spending money on new experiences?  And they would rather just drink at night than go to a nice Greek restaurant? But it still comes up occasionally: \"Dude, I can't believe you've never had a gyro\"?

Take that sorry individual to Gyros Palace for lunch.

The money for the food can't be beat.  And - not joking - this place has had the best Greek food I've come across since I've moved to AZ, in a large part because of the amazing Tzatziki sauce.

The Greek chicken salad -served with Tzatziki dressing of course - is delightful treat. The gyros are LOADED with juicy meat, thrown on the grill the moment you order it.

I only recently discovered this place, which is modestly wedged between a gym and several other restaurants, but with prices like this, I can see myself coming back and trying other menu options.

In terms of atmosphere....there isn't any.....but, hey, it's just a place you're taking your friend to lunch, right?"}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak was delicious.  Fries are good and the breaded mushrooms were tasty.  I recommend this place although I don't care for Greek food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful staff. This has become my favorite place to take friends. They always get my order done fast, and without mistakes. I don't get the vibe from the staff that I'm wasting their time. Overall very nice and respectful staff. Everything is clean.
 I think you have to try different things on the menu to see what you like. Not a fan of the Gyro wrap, but the shawarma wrap is delicious. Not a fan of the regular fries, but the sweet potato fries are bomb. If you didn't like the taste of something on the menu the first time around go back and try something different. Spinach pies and baklava is some of the best I've had in AZ
They definitely will see me back there."}
{"text":"First time visit and I'm very impressed! I was driving through the area just looking for a place to have lunch. I spotted the sign for Gyros and decided to try it out. When I got inside I realize they also had pastrami sandwiches. Haven't had one for a long time and I've been craving it so I ordered it. What a great decision. This isn't the crap pastrami you get at the grocery store. This is the real deal. Done up on the grill the way it's supposed to be done. The bread was great and the fries were nice and hot and crispy. Really good job guys. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Maybe someday Americans will learn that real gyros are made with actual meat and not a processed loaf concoction.  But until then neighborhood  joints like this will have to suffice. Friendly, fast, and convenient.. no frills but definitely solid. I visit 2-3 times per month."}
{"text":"Amazing. 

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that deceive you. Gyro Palace offers excellent authentic Greek food. 

I ordered the Greek Gyro Salad and it was simply delicious. The meat was hot and fresh. The vegetables were flavorful and fresh as well. The customer service is also attentive and polite. 

If you have yet to stop by Gyro Palace, I strongly recommend it. The place is excellent. I will be coming back often."}
{"text":"good food, a lot of bang for your buck"}
{"text":"I don't know about beign from Chicago or what the heck Amanda B. is talking about, but as a REAL GREEK, the gyros and tzatziki sauce are freaking great!!! Hummus - GREAT!!!  Gyros Palace doesn't sell itself as a Greek restaurant, rather quick fast food.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place should be called \"The Not So Good Food Palace\".
Their French fries seemed like over cooked store brand that I tried to fix with what seemed like watered down ketchup. My Cheese Steak was pretty bad and I will leave it at that. My son had a chili cheese hot dog that was impossible for him to pick up due to what seemed like an entire can of chili and cheese on it. My wife actually got a Gyro she said wasn't half bad but could have used more cucumber sauce.It seemed quite expensive with 2 drinks @ $26.95. I will not return."}
{"text":"Tried some place new as they have a coupon in the 2016 Entertainment book. TraditIonal gyro sandwich pita perfectly cooked, generous amount of meat, perfect balance of  sauce and tomatoes and onion. Here at 1:00 PM. Only one open table validates their food is good.  Sweet potato fries OK next time try regular fries."}
{"text":"I love the quality of the food here. It's just what I need when I'm on the run and need to take some food home for dinner. Usually get the gyro."}
{"text":"Owner/Manager was rude and rushed me through my order speaking over me to assume what I was going to ask for. I felt like an inconvenience as a paying customer who ordered a simple takeout gyro. They want you in and out as soon as possible (I should mention that I was the only customer at the time) and of course as previously mentioned, the price for the quality is absurdly high. You can get a far better quality qyro and service down the block for better price!"}
{"text":"Says they open at 10am. I start work at 5:30 am. 10am is lunch time for me. Second time I've come by at ten (and waited a few minutes after) and nobody there. Lights off. Chairs and furniture still stacked up. Is this place still in business!? Do they have some lazy stoner as a key holder? **EDIT: for the first time today I was actually able to dine at this establishment because they were finally open by 11:15. I'm dumb AF... weak portions and greasy gyros! I should have read the writing on the wall... won't go back."}
{"text":"Great gyros and an awesome philly cheesesteak. I don't really like white cheese, but that was my only choice for this sandwich, and it was so good ! It was an American Swiss and it blended well with the flavors of the sandwich. Will order again"}
{"text":"The extra star is for the staff. They were polite, energetic and helpful. I love gyros/Med. Food but their is not anything to love. I ordered a gyro, extra Tzatziki sauce on the side. The gyro was hot, well put together but totally lacking in taste. Mild, bland meat - horrid Tzatziki sauce. It actually looked and tasted like thin yogurt with dill in it, no cucumber taste or pieces at all and blander than the gyro meat. Will not be back nor recommend."}
{"text":"Italian beef very tasty sandwich loaded with very lean beef. Could have used a little more of the Italian spicing to make It a little more flavorful but all in all a very good sandwich"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat at this little place for lunch last week before running errands at the Sprouts and Lowe's across the street. I was surprised to see the selection of burgers and hot dogs along side the Mediterranean fare. The portions are large especially for lunch. We ordered the hummus appetizer, falafel plate and the gyro plate. The hummus was pretty good and came with plenty of pita. The tomatoes are quite pitiful as another reviewer mentioned. I just ate around them and added awesome ones from Sprouts to it when I had the remainder for dinner. The falafel was just ok. I have to admit I make it better. My boyfriend seemed quite pleased with his gyro and he also had extra for later."}
{"text":"The sauce tastes like it's water down mayonaise. And the chicken looks and tastes like it came out of frozen package from Costco. The only positive is the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, service is super fast. I order a kids meal for my sons to split and the guy gave me another cup for free no questions asks. You don't see that in a lot of places. Had a gyro was good the bread was super soft and had good tzatziki. I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Just like home! This place brings Chicago flavor to the west valley! A true diamond in the rough type place with great Italian beef and gyros. I would suggest I it to anyone who needs a Chicago food fix."}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I always get the grilled chicken greek salad. Lots of meat and does the job!"}
{"text":"this place is great!!!!!!!!!      no other stop to make.      best around don't go anywhere else.    If you can find a better Gyro let me know!!!!!!!! I'll stand by my reviews too. I was mentioned in another review and that guy is just some picky guy with no taste. I have tried a lot of other places around the valley and still have not found one that is as good as the palace.   like I said if anyone reading this knows one better please let me know or keep your comments to yourself. thank you."}
{"text":"Com'on, Yelp...check out Chris B and Tom K...(is that the names?).  I'll stand by my reviews anytime.

Anyway, my stars just went down to 2.  Any questions why??"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!! I can always count on Gyros Palace for a quick, affordable and delicious meal! Clean atmosphere, kind workers....every time I come in, the workers are always friendly with me and other customers. Keep doin' what you're doin' Gyros Palace. The ingredients are high quality too!! The philly cheese-stake, caesar salad and sweet potato fries are my fav!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. I had the gyros sandwich which was huge and fresh off the rotisserie. It was delicious and the place is spotless."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Gyro Palace  for several years now. Our meals are always tasty, the staff is very friendly and the restaurant is always clean! Keep up the good work :-) !"}
{"text":"This place is the best Chicago style gyros place in the West Valley. They have a great selection of tasty mediterranean food and a ton of greasy brown bag Chi-town favorites fresh off the fryer. Their stuff always tastes fresh and the folks on staff are welcoming."}
{"text":"I gave this place five stars cause I have never been disappointed. When I go I usually get the same thing a Gyro with fries (which is always on point) tonight I switched it up and got a pastrami burger and it was GREAT.....That's all I have to say about that (Forest Gump voice)"}
{"text":"I love finding a reason to be up in Peoria so I have an excuse to have a Gyro here.  I'm also from Chicago and this valley has very few restaurants that carve meat FRESH and have a great pita in the same sandwich.  The last time my husband tried the philly cheese steak and is in love with it.  I took a bite and had to agree it was really good."}
{"text":"This is our first visit.  We tried the place based on YELP reviews and I must say this place did not disappoint.  We ordered the #1 Gyros  Pita.  It was soooo delicious.  We ordered cucumbers and greek olives on the side because we like our sandwich this way - PERFECT!!!  The meat has good flavor, the bread was fesh and soft, the fries were cooked to order and the the portion was generous.  The staff is super friendly and helpful and the place is very clean!!  Overall a pleasant experience and great food."}
{"text":"stopped by tonight while in the area.  sitting in a strip-mall with a few restaurants the packing lot was PACKED, but the place itself was fine.  

I got Spanakopita and a Gyro.  The Gyro was VERY tasty, packed with meat (could have had a bit more tzatziki though).  It was also a bit greasier than i am use to for a Gyro but i still enjoyed it.  The Spanakopita was also very good (but greasy).  

i'm sure i'll go back if in the area and can't think of anything else to get, but won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Gyros sandwich was good with fresh and soft bread, although I've had larger portions of meat at other places for less money. I've had better fry's baked in my oven from the freezer section of the grocery store.  As a previous poster mentioned. Employees were quick to disappear as soon as you're served and there is no one else to help."}
{"text":"Incredibly generic.  Pita was bland, fries out of a bag and the chicken was very common.

I gave this place an extra star for customer service.  Ray did reach out to me after my last review to try to resolve the issue.  Glad to see a business who cares."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot! Have to try the gyro palace, the owners are always there and the service and good is amazing!"}
{"text":"The gyros are amazing here. The meat isn't overly greasy, and the veggies are always fresh. I love the sweet potato fries as well - they're perfectly crispy and salted just right. The Chicago style hotdogs, as well as their (huge) Philly cheesesteak, are delicious as well! The service is always good here and the atmosphere is very chill. They keep the restaurant nice and cold for us Arizonans too! Love it. 5/5"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place for a quick bite to eat. I always get the Gyro Pita and Fries. Big servings and fair prices. Would definitely recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Mediocre gyros...they are a bit greasy. There are many other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in the valley that are much better."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went there last week for the first time instead of going to Heidi's like I had planned. I got the gyro and sweet potato fries. The lamb meat was so tender it melted in your  mouth. They did not skimp on the meat and sauce either, that peta was packed with delicsiousness. I told my parents about it as they live near and my dad loves pastrami and they have pastrami sandwiches and more, they went next day and had the same great experience I did. I will be going back often that's for sure! The only thing I didn't care for was the falafels which I love but theirs tasted a bit different for my liking. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so, if you came here for the gyros, you came to the right place!  I order the gyro plate with an extra pita each time because it comes with the salad which contains tomatoes, feta, onion, and cucumber.  There's enough meat to make TWO gyros!  So, instead of ordering 2, just order this and assemble 2 yourself and save a ton of money.

As for the quality??? This is tied for #1 in my area with one other Gyro place.  

Why the 4 star review then?  So I LOVE Dolma!  Like REALLY REALLY love it.  Their Dolma is probably the worst I've ever had.  The grape leaves are SOAKED in oil and vinegar along with the rice inside to the point of just being mush all through the bite.  The flavor is fine (not GREAT, but fine) but the texture kills it for me.  

To end on a solid note, their tzatziki sauce is WONDERFUL!  It tastes and feels refreshing. There are two kinds of tzatziki I like. I like it when it's bursting with flavor and I like it when it's a very mellow flavor that adds moisture and compliments the Shwarma without distracting one from the shwarma flavor. Theirs is the latter and I always order extra!"}
{"text":"My daughter & I stopped by here for a quick bite during the week. I wasn't expecting much and WOW, very pleasantly surprised! While I cannot say much about the level of customer service or interaction with the staff....we ordered a Gyro plate, salad and extra side of rice. The portions are huge so we shouldn't have ordered anything extra and the food was absolutely fantastic. We had to actually get some to-go boxes as we had left over. I will defiantly drop in again the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! The Gyros Pita and the Philly Cheese steak are the bomb. Fast and friendly service too :)"}
{"text":"This is my new happy place. Second time I've been here the food is excellent the portions are huge. Last time I had a traditional Gyro which was just perfectly prepared and this time I had their Philly steak sandwich. best Philly steak sandwich I've ever had.  Fries and sandwich or both piping-hot."}
{"text":"So I arrived at my psychiatrist appointment early and decided to pick up a late lunch. The reason I stopped here is the Chicago dog sign on the window. I absolutely love a good Chicago dog. And I have explained before I am applied since I have eaten Chicago dogs in Chicago. I don't use that as my bar because that would be unfair. But there are good Chicago dogs in az and there are mediocre ones. This was somewhere in the middle. I would like to try their gyros. I like gyros, and although I have never had them in Greece, I have had them in New York and those were amazing. So let's just say these gyros have a steep hill to climb."}
{"text":"This place is easy to get in and out of - easy to find and plenty of parking. The menu offers a variety without being overwhelming. The prices are competitive and the portions are just right. Go in hungry, my food was great!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot, disappointed again. The best thing was the pizza puff. My gyros plate looked like a plate for a kid, my wife's sandwich had scrapes of gyros, and I should have known because i didn't seen the cone on the burner so by default we were going to get small chucks instead of long strips."}
{"text":"Always had a respectable gyros pita here. Return often. Might try chicken next time ? 
..........'cause I'm adventurous like that :)  !"}
{"text":"I really like the owners!!! I 'used' to like another gyros place closer to home, but the new owner is a jerk at that place!! (See my other review.) So, I discovered this place, and the other place (on Bell Road and 59th Avenue) will NEVER see me and my family again!!

I'm thankful for the run-in with the new jerk owner at the other place. That is how I discovered Gyros Palace!! We are fans for sure!! They are so good to their customers!! Pride of ownership and pride of food and service is obvious every single time!! Portions are huge, the food is great and the prices are fair!! I certainly don't miss that other spot at all!!!!"}
{"text":"OK. Service is OK. Food is OK. Nothing bad. Nothing great. This place was very slow when I was there. Their problem is that The Greek Wrap is down the road. To compete with TGW they will need to step up their game. One peice of advice: stop watering down the ketchup."}
{"text":"staff was not very friendly. They need to change the name as it is not just a Gyro place, they serve hot dogs and hamburgers and the fries were terrible.  Nothing fancy about them like the other Gyros places I have been too.  Once you got your food and if there was no one else the staff all disappeared. Will not be returning.  The food was just okay nothing that makes you go wow."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food and very fast! We live in Surprise and make the drive because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here since it was lunch hour and it's close to my work. Decor was nothing special - just a clean, order at the counter, take-out place with 9 or so tables. I ordered the falafel pita and a side of garlic fries. The falafel was not good at all - the falafel balls were mushy and didn't have the crispy texture that falafel should have. Secondly, the pita itself was soft all the way through, and not slightly grilled on the outside like the way I like mine. Thirdly, they skimped on the tzatziki sauce. Garlic fries were OK and topped with a garlic mayo sauce, but I thought it was a little TOO garlicky. I tasted it in my breath and tongue for about the next 6-7 hours. All in all, I wasn't too impressed with this place. I'd come back and try the gyro to see if it's any better. If not, I will have to look elsewhere for take-out Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Falafel wasn't overcooked, had a good spicy flavor, and pita was nice as well.  Onion rings weren't so good though, especially for $3 as a small side portion.  Prices were a little high for this style of food in a fast food setting ($9 for Falafel plate?).  Will try again."}
{"text":"Food is good but felt very uncomfortable as the cashier was calling the guys cooking \"freaking idiots\" I won't come back."}
{"text":"The experience in this lovely restaurant begins with a friendly and upbeat greeting no matter who is on staff at the register. My coworkers and I are always greeted with a bright smile and a cheerful hello, setting the tone for a positive and lovely dining experience.

The selection is varied, and the prices are phenomenal. The portions are generous, and the quality never disappoints. My food is always served hot, swift and well-made. My salad is always crisp and flavorful, the meat always tender, the bread always fresh.

The staff are very warm and engaging, and will remember you upon return visits. The restaurant itself is always tidy, and seats many while feeling cozy rather than cluttered. Whether you've got an hour for your lunch or your whole day stretching on before you, you can't go wrong with a visit to this lovely establishment."}
{"text":"Lunch time and Gyros Place was across the road. Decided to give it a try. Place seemed to be clean decor was some paintings of the New York skyline. Pretty much like most of the strip mall food places. I got their special which was a chicken pita with fries and a drink. Meal was priced right. The fries was hot and taste. The pita was good. There was nothing wrong with the food it just was not anything to write home about. Would I eat there again. The answer is: If I happen to be in the area at lunch time, hungry, I might eat there again. Would just depend on what I was wanting. There was nothing exceptional about them. The food was OK the service was OK. Nothing special."}
{"text":"The gyros are fantastic! Unfortunately the falafel is always overcooked. All in all, its a good place for a quick lunch or dinner. If I have time to plan a meal, I would probably end up somewhere else."}
