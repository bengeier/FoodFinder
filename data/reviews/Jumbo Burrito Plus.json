{"text":"Excellent food! Great flavour and overall taste, and all at a very reasonable price.  Love the look and taste of their potato sticks! and very friendly and welcoming costumer service. Would 100% recommend to anyone, as I will surely be back asap.."}
{"text":"I live near this place so i decided to try it out and after reading yelp reviews i didnt actually believe that the burrito would be thin and under filled. It is...its very thin and you cant really taste anything besides the sauce. Burrito Boyz is up the street is the same price yet you get at least double the filling with better quality ingrediants. Yes, they give you a free potato stick but im going to a burrito place for a burrito not deep fried potatoes. All in all its not bad."}
{"text":"The owners need to go to local burrito places and see what you get for the same price. A teaspoon of guacamole, 4 strips of lettuce, another teaspoon of fried beans? Come on.   Good service and the burrito was just OK but I won't be back, no reason to go here and waste my money (no, the free potato stick isn't enough) when I can get twice as much, way better quality and taste for the same price."}
{"text":"Found this new burrito joint today and the coolest thing about them is they give you a free potato stick with every burrito.  It's like a foot and a half long stick of spiraled potato on a stick.  I ordered the jumbo chicken ($7.xx) burrito with everything but rice with chipotle mayo and a tad of suicide sauce.  I expected a really big burrito with some good weight...but it was kinda on the lighter side.  It was tasty with some good heat...but not as much chicken as expected.  Will try a different burrito next time...maybe the halibut or pulled pork."}
{"text":"While the workers seemed very eager, this business is set up to fail.  Everything just takes way too long, the toppings were not fresh (dried out refried beans, guacamole that had long since oxidized) and were also questionable (mushrooms, olives, and pineapples for a burrito?).  When I did finally get my burrito, the first thing I noticed was an overpowering mustard-like taste. As there was no mustard in the burrito, I still can't figure out where it was coming from. The salsa, perhaps?   It tasted as bad as the ingredients looked. It's safe to say that I will not be returning to this place. There is a Burrito Boyz just down the street that is worth the extra 2 minute drive.   You've been warned."}
{"text":"It took a while but I finally found a decent burrito in the west end of Toronna. The service was attentive and the place was bright and spotless, but it's not the take-out atmosphere that will be bringing you back. That would be burritos. Jumbo freakin' burritos.   My grilled steak was indeed a jumbo portion, perfectly seasoned with a nice touch of pepper and maybe slightly on the juicy side of well done (sadly not always a given at GTA burrito joints) while the toppings were generous and fresh. The guac looked homemade and was good enough to serve with chips, but I will single out the  jalape√±o mayo -- wish I'd asked for a side to dip the savory, salty and complimentary potato stick into. I will try the pulled pork next visit, although I'm curious what they do with jerk chicken..."}
{"text":"My go to place to stop on the way home when I don't want to cook. I always get the pulled pork quesadilla with their burrito sauce and have never been disappointed. Plus potato sticks!!"}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch and the place was packed. I  tried the double burger burrito. It's a burrito with two beef patties and it's dressed like a burger - onions, lettuce, tomatoe and secret sauce. It was AMAZING!!!! The actual burger was soooo juicy. It came with a potatoe stick and a drink all for only $4.99. Great lunch deal.   I will definitley be coming back to try their other burritos."}
{"text":"There are a lot of burrito joints around the city, but only a handful stand out. I'm not saying that Jumbo Burrito is heaven on earth, but it does the jumb.  I jist like coming here to see my girl eat her burrito with two hands."}
