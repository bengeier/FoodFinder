{"text":"Went to The Venue Bistro 8/20/2015 for a business dinner.  Group sat outside on the beautiful patio area.  Food was very good. Group shared Sausage & Ricotta flatbread, stuffed Prosciutto Rolls, and Stuffed Portabellos before entre.  All were very good.  The service team at The Vendur Bistro was excellent Checking on the table at the right moments.  Only thing that I would hope tey work on is the music sound system a bit loud and had to talk loud to hear each other when the act was playing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, friendly staff but still to new.  They seemed overwhelmed when it busy and the place inside feels empty and underwhelming (like it needs more places to sit i.e. more sofas, causal seating not tables). The wine list was ok but I would like to see better wines not a list of wines I can go pick up at Giant Eagle myself.  Our server was very nice, friendly, and made recommendation on the small plates for us.  If Yelp allowed half stars it would get 3.5 from me but I wasn't ready to give it 4.  I will definitely be back to check it out again."}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST place ever. The service is terrible. These people try to take your money and rip you off. Never ever come here food is out of a frozen box. Poor business practices. I rate this zero stars. McDonald's has better service and food."}
{"text":"So cute. A Lakewood style wine bar outside of Lakewood. Delicious food, very nice staff and inexpensive. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly (perhaps too friendly as they work to define the culture of this new restaurant), the food is very well made and priced reasonably considering the quality.  The place also has a great atmosphere and true to their name, a decent wine selection.  Why only three stars then?  I'm always here with someone else as wine bars aren't exactly my thing (due to their lack of, you know, beer).  If you're in to wine bars and great casual food then feel free to add a star or two."}
{"text":"Eighteen dollar plate of so called scampi and undercooked smashed potatoes.Very disappointing- I don't know how they are still in business. We will never go back."}
{"text":"All I have to say is I ordered a steak dinner and it was a 3oz steak medallion with CANNED green beans and CANNED potatoes...... that's all. Worst place ever!!!! I wish I would have taken a picture"}
{"text":"First time here tonight and we were impressed! The server was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu items and the wine. The patio was such a nice place to sit and relax on a summer evening with their beautiful fireplace outside blocking the view of the busy street and the live music coming from inside. The food was very good, fresh and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance, the live entertainment was outstanding as was the service! We had ZachÂ Galifianakis's look alike (if you have been there you know!) And he was great! The food was awesome and priced extremely affordable. We had the stuffed mushrooms and the flat bread and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in my 38 years. I wanted to like the place because it definitely has a cool atmosphere, but that's all it has going. There were seven of us in our party. We started off by ordering a couple of apps. No stuffed mushrooms. No warm bread. That's cool. We ordered a couple of others. We then ordered our meals. They have a lot of appetizers and salads, but a limited menu as far as main courses. A section of flatbreads. One of wraps and maybe 10 entrees. I ordered a wrap and was informed they were out of them. The waitress then told me that I probably didn't want one anyway as the cook usually burns them. Burns a wrap!? Is that even possible? We had two in our party who ordered flatbreads. About 10 minutes after we ordered we were informed that they were out of the flatbreads as well, but we could get anything on the menu at the same price. When the meals finally came no one was really impressed. One of our party ordered a Caesar salad. They brought out a spinach salad. Someone's food was cold. The couple of us who ordered the ribeye were disappointed. It was supposed to come with potatoes and a vegetable. No veggie. Someone asked and of course they were out of vegetables, so they decided it was okay to give us double potatoes. Ok, so far, for those of you keeping count, 4/7 were told they were out of what they wanted and one was brought the wrong meal. The food overall was just alright. My steak which was ordered medium well, was more on the light medium side, but it was doused in garlic. Not very good. There was a sign there that mentioned the Venue would be celebrating their one year anniversary soon. I can honestly say if they provide experiences like that to too many other patrons they will not celebrate a second. Hey wait, where's the 1/2 star button on this app!"}
{"text":"We had 2 flat breads, 4 salads, artichoke dip, 1 entre, 2 martinis and glass of wine. $88.   Everything is ala carte. No bargains. No bread w/ meal.   A lot of carbs. 
Everything was above average.  I was undecided on the meatloaf, they brought a sliver to taste.  
Nice spacious decor, very nice and clean bathrooms. The place was not busy but it was loud. 
They need a sign that can be scene.  I knew where it was and I drove right by.  
I think they make a killing during the summer as they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"We decided on the Venue for a quick dinner and drinks before going to see the Cleveland orchestra. The decor is odd, parts are very nice and modern and others seem sterile and unfinished. Drinks started out rough. One friend just got ginger ale and they only filled the glass half full? I ordered a white sangria, they may need to look this one up. Never have I ever had orange juice in my wine. We order some appetizers and flatbreads to share, and the food was pretty good. I would go back and sit on the patio with a cold beer."}
{"text":"First off, the entrance is very odd. If you enter from the parking lot in back, you have to walk past open storage rooms and the kitchen and there is no hostess stand or any signs telling you to either seat yourself or wait to be seated. There were several waitresses chatting with each other, but we seemed to annoy one of them by wanting a table. After about 10 minutes, another waitress noticed that no one had brought us drinks, so she asking if anyone had taken our order. My mom ordered white sangria, which appeared to be white wine with orange juice dumped in it. The pot roast was dry, and not as good as others reviews. I had asked for a side of ranch, but was forgotten about. After 15 minutes, our waitress apologized and said she thought someone else was going to bring the ranch out for me. I saw another waitress repeatedly walking from the kitchen to other tables chewing food! At one point, she had to excuse herself as she had to finish chewing before she could take an order from the table next to us. The service was horrible at this place, and the food was Bob Evans quality at triple the price. Never going back here!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food was all canned or frozen. You can get a better meal at Dennys for a third of the price."}
{"text":"we stopped in on a recommendation of a co worker, it was Saturday around 4:30 pm. she told me that the venue was new and they had really good sandwiches and pasta for around 8-10 dollars. they patio looks great from the outside and was nice to sit on. traffic noise from pearl road was as we expected. but we did sit in the corner of the patio, near the road. they have a great outdoor fireplace that would block the noise, but it was in the mid 80's so we didnt want any more heat. 
i ordered the California club sandwich which was just the right blend of heat, with peppered bacon and shiratsa mayo, the were out of avacado, which i think would have added to the sandwich. it was one of the better club sandwiches i have had. spinach and goat cheese on a cresent.  my boyfriend orded the meatloaf sandwich with caramelized onion on toasted bread. it was very good. on the way home he said \"how can a place make a freaken meatloaf sandwich so darn good\" or something of that sort. i had a bite, it was really good. 
he had a side of home make potato salad, and fruit, and i had the pasta salad. the sides were also good. 
the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. he was attentive and seemed to be excited about the new additions coming to the menu, and the expanding wine and beer list. he also told us about the music every Thursday through the weekend from 6-9.  he knew the menu very well and was able to recommend items. he was obviously an experienced server and provided us with every thing we needed. personable and friendly, but just enough interaction not to be over visiting. when we come back i hope to have him as a waiter again. 
i would definitely come back and sit out on the patio again, i think it will be really nice when it starts to cool down and get dark early, the fireplace puts out some heat."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  Service was slow, food quality was really disappointing.   Waitress was unprofessional.  I would never go back, will be surprised if this place lasts much longer."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night.  Food was very good. I had the arugula salad and the meatloaf dinner.  Great flavors. My wife had the salad with mushrooms and hot bacon dressing and the Fusili pasta dinner.
We chose to eat outside because they had a live entertainer with an amplifier in a small dining room. it was too loud for us."}
{"text":"A gem hidden in Parma Hts. Great atmosphere to go with great selection of wines. Love that they have small plates, so you can dine on a variety of dishes. If the weather permits the outdoor seating is a must. There is a fireplace both indoors and outdoors. Great atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Venue Bistro is a great place!! My husband and I went there on a rainy Friday night and one of the first things I noticed was an amazing patio area with an awesome fireplace. What a bummer it was raining though, right?? Nope not at The Venue Bistro...part of the patio is covered so there were still people able to sit outside and enjoy the evening, the fire and the cool weather. The inside of the building has a variety of seating options, they have comfy, quaint areas with couches designed for those who just want to come and have some drinks and small plates, there's a section with dining tables for those of us who want to eat a full meal then there is a huge banquet area for all your major events and celebrations!! The space is really big. The evening we went there was live music which was a nice touch again for people who are just hanging out and want to have a chill relaxed evening. Now let me talk about the most important part...THE FOOD! Don't let the smaller menu fool you, the food is amazing!! It is fresh and perfectly executed. The small plates are the perfect size to share but the entree blew my mind. My husband has a pasta dish, fresh pasta I might add,  which was so amazing I kept stealing bites from his plate. Now I had the special...a pork chop with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Uh pork chop?? Yeah I don't normally get excited over a pork chop but I seriously could have cuddles up in front of a fire with this pork chop. It's was absolutely mouth watering and amazing. It had an amazing glaze on it and was cooked perfectly. We also shared a bottle of wine, which their wine selection is pretty awesome too and I love wine so I was very happy with the options. We also had a trio of cheesecake which all three were amazing but if they have the peanut butter one when you go guy one to eat there and to take home because later in the night you're gonna want another piece. The service was also amazing. Water glasses were always filled and my wine glass always had wine in it. The General Manager even stopped at our table to see how everything was!! We were impressed. We don't live in the area, we were in town visiting family :) and tried out The Venue Bistro and were 100% satisfied. Next time we are in the area we will definitely go again!!! Well Done Venue Bistro!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by on a Saturday night.  First the space.  The place is contemporary and tidy with lots of room.  The service was excellent and our waiter was very helpfull with drink selections and menu suggestions.  We had a flatbread with artichoke and feta as an appetizer.  It was delicious. We also each ordered a pasta bowl.  Mine was a with shrimp and a creamy sauce with just a hint of spice.  Hers had chicken.  We both loved out food.  The food prices were very affordable, and if we hadn't had drinks as well we could easily have dined for under 35 bucks including tip.  That said the drinks were also fairly priced depending on your desire.  Not sure if they have a full service bar, but we each tried a couple wines or craft brews. There was a live musician on the patio.  He was entertaining and engaging and not intrusive loud.  I may have found myself singing along to Neil Diamond at one point.  All in all this was a nice night out and I will definitely recommend this place to feiends."}
{"text":"Im in the neighborhood and am delighted to have a more foodie friendly option nearby.  I frequent the Venue at least monthly. Recently, I am a little disappointed to see the menu change. It has a minimalist offering as far as entree now. Also they changed the spinach dip toast crusts to chips. So Sad.  :("}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere, GREAT drinks I'm falling in love with this place. We sat outside right by the fire pit which made us feel like we were at a resort. The service was flawless, they tended to our every single question and need. the pulled pork flatbread was literally everything on a plate, the meat was so tender and flavorful, it was such a unique marriage of flavors was perfect and to think that was just the appetizer!!! I had the meatloaf with tomato bacon jam, it was the best freaking meatloaf i think i have ever had! paired it with a nice Caesar salad and i was a happy camper. My husband had the pot roast which is claimed to be roasted for \" 8 hours\"  and you can bet your behind they probably did do just that because it just fell off your fork the meat. It was so delicious im watering from the mouth just reviewing it. Im so glad i tried this place, at first glance i was hesitant but its close to home for  me, its affordable and the atmosphere lets me escape the cleveland life for a while. a TRUE gem for Parma Heights!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for an early dinner.  Sat outside on the patio under an umbrella.  Very friendly waiter.  He was attentive and knowledgeable about the items on the menu.  He made a wine suggestion but we were disappointed they didn't have any non alcoholic beer for my husband. I ordered the flatbread with artichoke dip and chicken.  Delicious!  My husband had their beef soup and that was also really good.  The price for dinner was very reasonable.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place was the perfect middle class classy. It's a beautiful place with great service and food but at a very affordable price. Awesome patio with a beautiful fireplace. Glasses of wine range from $4 to $8 and they fill them to the brim! No skimpy half glass. The food is all fresh in fact the server told us the owner is building a greenhouse to grow their own produce in the back. They have music every night thurs through Sunday. I can definitely see making this a frequent spot. There's lots of great bars in Parma but it's nice to have something different and a little nicer like a wine bar!"}
{"text":"Visited the place when it had just opened. Althoug they did not have a cocktail menu it was a full bar which kind of worked out. I've tried the salad and flatbread which were both decent but not great! Another time I visited to see if there had been any improvement in their food unfortunately the pasta I had was a tad too oily - like I could literally see a thick layer of oil over the pasta even the pasta sauce was floating on it! My husband had ordered a sandwich which was a tad to dry and hard for him as compared to the usual sandwiches. The first Time there was live music too which we enjoyed! The outdoor seating, ambience and bar is good but the food not so much!"}
{"text":"The Venue exceeded my expectations!

A friend and I enjoyed flat breads and $4 vino on The Venue's beautiful patio. It was a Saturday and there was fantastic live music.

I'd definitely recommend The Venue to anyone around the Parma area and beyond!"}
{"text":"What a gem in Parma Hts! Cute atmosphere, especially the patio and live music. The food was amazing and the sangria was delicious as well as their signature drinks. My only suggestion would be to add a few standard fare items to the menu - like burgers. And a bigger sign would likely draw even more people. I live around the corner and only learned of this place a few months ago through a fundraiser.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is a great find, nice atmosphere and the food we ordered was delicious. The first 2 items that I wanted to ordet were not available. I found that odd since we decided to have an early dinner. Our waitress was kind but she was by herself wating on 6 tables and a large group of 20 plus tables. She qas doing the best she could considering being short staffed. I\"m hoping on our next visit they will be better staffed."}
{"text":"This is a quite a gem for Cleveland suburbia. While the food is not 5 stars, everything else about this place is. First, service was fantastic and the wait staff was very sweet and attentive. As for wine, I had the house white zinfandel which was delicious - sweet, but not too sweet. Plus, they fill your glass up all the way - no skimping on wine portions! The ambiance of the place is wonderful. Spacious with high ceilings and simple contemporary decor. They also have an outdoor patio. My favorite part was the little nook with a fireplace and leather chairs nearby. How often to you get to sit next to a FIREPLACE these days?! My friend and I had a cozy evening next to the fireplace while listening to live music. And the live music was a lovely touch - not too overwhelmingly loud and one could request songs off a list. Finally, the prices here are very affordable. 

The food, as I mentioned, was just average. The stuffed portabella was decent and the bacon wrapped artichoke hearts were strange and not to my liking. In the end though I had a lovely evening here and there aren't too many places like this in the 'burbs, so I definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Love the fusilli with shrimp pasta! Great wine prices!"}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced.  Atmosphere was nice too. Our waiter was very polite but his hair and beard were a mess and he smelled terrible!  I assume he is part owner or related to owner because no one in their right mind would hire someone who looks and smells homeless to serve food like that."}
{"text":"First time visiting and it will be the last. Should have read some reviews prior. Entering the building was odd, felt like I was searching for someone to guide me on what to do. Looks nice inside and out. Cocktails? No menu and a simple drink was horrible; over poured and to strong. Got an appetizer; figured a wine venue might have a decent cheese platter; no..cheap and not what I expected. Very slow service as well."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff, nice drink specials and really great small bites,
especially the flatbreads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful building. Great concept. However, they do not know how to run a restaurant. Not open for lunch, and very short hours when they are open. I pass it by everyday and know one is every there."}
{"text":"Returning, the food did not measure up to my previous experience and the service was sluggish."}
{"text":"High prices and below average food. Owners are rude. We won't be back anytime soon. All the food is from Costco or gfs. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Loved this place it had amazing prices! We tried multiple items on the menu -- mushroom bruschetta was Devine! Very affordable and cute inside with the fireplace. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. It's cold, sterile and the wine selection is lacking. The food is nothing more than a Panera Bread chain quality. To make matters worse, the parking lot is so dangerous. They have these poles that are sticking out of the ground, beware. Save your money, this place sucks"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim the other night and I can honestly say, this is the best meal I've had south of Tremont in years!  The food we had was trendy and full of flavor, the wine was fantastic, and the prices were great!  We tried a flatbread and two of the small plates.  We were a little disappointed that they were out of one of our small plate choices and one of the wines, but we tried some others instead and they were DELISH!  Plus the wines were big pours, so YAY!  And honestly, if you aren't hungry but are hankering for some gelato in Parma land, their coconut gelato was AMAZING.  And the portion they gave us was huge!  For $4!  Our entire meal for 2 people, including wine and dessert was $40.  Crazy!  We have already scheduled a big group dinner out with friends later this month so more people can try it.  They don't have giant plates overflowing with food, but what you get is a good portion at a fantastic price... definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio space is very inviting and that's what lured my date and I in for dinner on a Friday night. It was a little too warm for outdoor dining, so we headed inside... and that's where the comfortable flow ended. I feel like The Venue has a little identity crisis. Inside, there were tables and some casual seating areas. It had the potential to be fine dining, except there was a man playing typical bar/ island cover music on a guitar. He was decent, but it just didn't fit with the mood. There was a couple sitting next to us, the girl had her shoes off and feet up on the coffee table. I certainly can't hold that against the restaurant, but I was really turned off. Put your feet away ma'am. 

Our server was really distracted and while he was friendly, we had to wait for him on several occasions.  My date enjoyed his steak, our wine was a decent bottle and my food was cooked well. The menu didn't say it came with mashed potatoes and I was disappointed to find a huge portion on my plate when it arrived. I'm strict low carb and the temptation was not fun, I would have preferred to ask for no potato or sub for another green veggie.

There was nothing to WOW us at this venue, so I likely won't be back.

However, if you're looking for a space to hold a private party, the back room was a good size, nice and clean and I've heard it was affordable."}
