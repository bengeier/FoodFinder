{"text":"I have tried the chicken, burgers, wraps, and pasta here.  Everything is excellent and inexpensive. I recommend the half chicken with potatoes and rice for under 10$."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did.  It is a stone's throw from my house and the owner is extremely friendly and genuine.  The menu is extensive and prices are reasonable, however their should-be piece de resistance - the portuguese chicken - was extremely dry and devoid of any sort of flavour.  I'd like to think that maybe I came at a bad time or it was a fluke because the owner is just too damned nice.  I will try it once more."}
{"text":"You know you're single when you start to order burgers and wings for delivery and are too lazy to pick it up. Rating is more like 3.5 stars.

Likes:
*Monster burger -$8. Two tender juicy patties with cheese on top.  So simple yet so delicious.  You really get to enjoy the great meat quality.
*No delivery charge over $15.
*Owner is so nice

Dislikes:
*The 1lb honey garlic wings -$5.  They weren't breaded or crispy enough for my liking and while some people like that, I don't, but that's somewhat on me as they said \"lightly breaded\".

Verdict: will definitely try some of their burgers and rotisserie chicken but will avoid wings."}

Arrived at the door in good timing.  

The Beak Street 6oz burger was yummy and messy all the same.  Hamburger was a somehow crumbly.  They were a little stingey on the toppings, as I had specifically asked for more hot peppers... But in the end I found it to be very filling.    

Poutine wasn't made with cheese curds, but tasted alright.  I can also appreciate that they took the time to uniformly mix the cheese and gravy before having itan placed into the container itself.  Most restaurants just put the fries in and dump the gravy and cheese on top.

This place was labeled as a Portuguese restaurant, and the description supplied lets the consumer know that its a mash up of a little bit of everything.  Burgers, sandwiches, chicken and more.  It's nice, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a churrasqueira."}
{"text":"The Burger was quite decent, the cheeseburger poutine was yum, but the chicken wings were very meh. For a delivery burger place, I'll definitely try it again"}
