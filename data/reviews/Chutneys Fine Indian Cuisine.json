{"text":"Fantastic butter chicken!  love the after dinner herbs to help aid digestion and cleansed the pallet"}
{"text":"We have been there a few times. The restaurant is very nice and clean. The staff are super friendly and are very helpful at making suggestions. Last order we tried the naan and it was sub-par. The butter chicken, vindaloo and other entrees are very tasty.  A little pricey but would definitely make this an Indian staple for the area!"}
{"text":"As someone who is Gluten sensitive I look at how many options I have on the menu. What I've found was that all the items were gluten smart except for the bread.
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was surprisingly light for this classy restaurant.
Great food! Lots of options, meat. vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free, savory, sweet & always delicious."}
{"text":"We've been there lots of times.  Good Indian food.  Lentils are great.  Curry dishes are also good.  Prices have crept up a bit.  Service is friendly.   I recommend it."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Only me and my kids plus a couple of other patrons in the restaurant.

Wonderful atmosphere, service was good, food was delicious.

And then came time to pay - cash only said the owner/waiter/chef. Stickers on the front door say Visa/MC/Debit. Nope! Cash only said the owner.

The other people in the restaurant didn't have cash either. We both had to run a couple blocks away to find an ATM. If you are going to be a cash-only establishment, remove the stickers from the front door that indicate otherwise, and put an ATM inside.

I would have given this place five-stars if they were clear up front about payment options."}
{"text":"Won't reorder. $21 tandoori shrimp were the size of toonies. Stale naan texture. Threw half of $100 order away."}
{"text":"I think a lot of the previous reviews didn't give chutneys a fair chance. If you're unhappy with something just politely make note of it the next time you order and something will be done to make sure you're satisfied. That's what you get when you have owners and management who care about quality service and food. In any resteraunt whomever I'd making the food is not going to know what they did wrong if the only action you take is through a rant on Yelp. 

I have never had Indian food before. Never! I was convinced to go try it after much debate with my boyfriend who is a chef and well versed on both sides of the table. We also went with his friend from England and his girlfriend, who has undoubtedly tried an array of Indian cuisine.

I have to say we were all very impressed. I'm a very picky eater and I was eating a little of everyone else's food to try, then sneak attacking for some more! We all vowed to go back. My boyfriend the chef gave his seal of approval

The staff was incredible, prompt and polite. I'm not sure if it was the owner or a manager we spoke to but he was super humble and made sure we were taken care of. 

Make sure you check them out, it will be worth your while"}
{"text":"We used to go to Chutney's all the time, but recently, the food quality is disappointing.  Lamb vindaloo was actually potato vindaloo with a tiny piece of lamb.  Butter chicken sauce was so watery, we had to add a jar of butter chicken sauce to eat it.  Black lentil dish also was watery with few lentils."}
{"text":"We've recently moved to the area and we were hoping this could be our new Indian food go-to restaurant. The food was tasty but nothing to really boast about, especially when discussing food and value. I've had better indian food in TO that was offered at a more reasonable price. 

Also, the server made a mistake on our order, twice. Which is OK, I guess, but then he questioned us about them. Why would we lie about what we ordered? It was so...weird."}
{"text":"Casual yet classy. Great food and great service. The waiter offered recommendations of typical Indian appetizers and paired it with delicious masala chai tea. The lamb vindaloo was spiced perfectly along with tandoori chicken on a sizzling platter and spinach paneer all accompanied by fragrant saffron rice and garlic naan. Fresh tasty and delicious food served with care. The atmosphere is quiet and allows for great dinner conversation."}
{"text":"We'd intended to try this place for a long time, and finally one night when I was seriously craving some Indian, we decided to give it a spin. The atmosphere is great - very clean and well decorated (it doesn't really smell strongly of spices like a lot of Indian restaurants I've been too). 

The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive. Our dishes were fantastic and we were both very pleased with the quality and taste of the food. The portions were great and we were able to share our meals with one order of rice, which is great since I find at other places you usually each need your own order of rice. 

Our food came out quickly, and we were not rushed through our dinner even though we left only shortly before their closing time. We were too full to order dinner, but the waiter brought us out some sort of mango puree dessert in shot glasses to try, on the house. It was delicious and confirmed that we'll be having dessert the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Top notch curries all made from scratch.
Chutney's hold it's own with many high end Indian anywhere.
If you are looking for fusion Indian, go elsewhere. 
Chutney's serves up all of your favorites and get the spice just right.
Service is friendly, but the owners are fiery when challenged. 
They make up for this in the quality of the food.

For those turned off  by the owners, I understand. But for me, food quality always trumps services when you're not paying a premium.

They have a deal for a significant percentage off pickup orders before 5pm, which cuts a sizable amount off the bill.
May favorites are veg biryani, chik tikka masala, aloo gobi masla and mutter paneer. Pikoras are also top notch."}
{"text":"Recently visited Chutneys as it is in our neighbourhood. There are not too many places around us like this one. Impeccable service, spotless clean environment, quiet and peaceful to relax over amazingly-tasting food. Both my boyfriend and I have ordered appetizers, paneers, pakoras, and butter chicken with fragrant rice. What a feast. The food was plentiful. Both of us took a small box of leftovers. 

This place is not cheap though. It does take a good bill to enjoy a full course supper, but it is worth every penny. And once in a while, why not treat yourself to this deliciousness."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon.  They were very nice and accommodating to us, and we had a good time.  Their food was ok.  Their lamb shank dish was one I had never tried before, and it was neat.  I'd go back if I were in the area and wanting Indian food.

For those with families, it's great because there was no noise on a very early Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I loved it- the husband didn't care for it. 
For that, it gets a 4/5.
Ordered the butter chicken and chicken korma- rice- naan. Fair prices, and I guess extra nice because there isn't much selection in the area and it was nice to have some tasty indian near my home.
Yuuuuuuuum."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Chutney's, only ever gotten take out, but so far I've been impressed. Not blown away by every dish, but have enjoyed most of the dishes I've tried and they do make the items really spicy upon request!

Their mulligatawny soup is pretty good (the daal soup is quite bland and unexciting though), the paneer makhini is delicious, and so is the veggie korma. I have tried an ocra dish as well and found it just okay. Solid butter chicken. Their mango and rose (!!) lassis are soooooo good (I had never heard of a rose flavoured one before, so I had to try it and was not disappointed). Overall, I'd say the food is above average."}
{"text":"It's ok.... Pretty good but not over the top great. It's a solid 3 1/2 stars for sure but so many little things makes it no where near a 4. Service took forever.... From original ordering to getting the bill and when I went to the bar to pay they said oh we would have brought that to you. (I actually asked for it 15 min prior). My food was lukewarm at best however when I asked them to heat it up they did no problem. I ordered samosas that never came so when they appeared on my bill I told them and they took it off and gave them to me to go which I thought was nice. The people are nice but seriously don't seem to have a clue about waiting on tables and customer service other then bringing you your food. Also the price listed on their menu for two of the items was less then what they charged but it amounted to about $3 so I said nothing, gave a lesser tip and called it a day at that point. If i was in the neighbourhood would I go again, sure.... Would I go out of my way probably not."}
{"text":"This was the first place we dined in after arriving in Toronto. Food was very good and portions were large enough that we got food to take away. However, I'm not sure if this was specific to this establishment, or if this is just how it is in Toronto in general, but rice wasn't included in the orders (we're used to getting rice when dining at Indian restaurants in Washington, DC). So that was a bit of a surprise. Nonetheless, I'd go there again, now that I know what to expect."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try Chutneys since we were in the area and they had decent reviews. The restaurant itself is clean and modern looking but the tables are pretty small. Nobody greeted us at the door or showed us to a table so we were left wondering if they were even open for business.

The butter chicken was delicious but it's not something I can't find elsewhere. Can't say the same about the garlic naan - it wasn't very garlicky at all. There wasn't a lot of chicken pieces in the butter chicken but I personally don't mind as I prefer less meat and more sauce.

The service was below expectations, especially because of their location. When we asked for containers for our leftovers, our waiter placed both in the same paper bag and there was sauce all over the outside of the plastic bag (thanks...). We were going to pay by cash but then he said he didn't have change. If this was an attempt to receive a tip, we were going to tip regardless, just not generously. And what restaurant doesn't have enough cash for change? Seriously.

Overall, I wouldn't say it was the worst experience since I did enjoy the food but I definitely won't be coming back. Better bang for your buck elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Great vegetarian options. Staff and service is excellent. Good wine list too. Will be my go-to spot for Indian cuisine for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered for take out - very impressed! The quality of food and flavours truly resembles the taste of India. Perfect amount of spice with each dish. The one and only reason why this place isn't a 5 star is because I found their prices to be a bit pricey, however, I would most definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"My favourite indian food in Toronto. I also love the fact that they deliver, though I wish they did that earlier on in the day as well. Very, very good food!"}
{"text":"Being a child immigrant, I grew up in a real melting pot neighbourhood and I ate the foods of so many different cultures.  Indian food to this day remains one of my most favorite foods.  I used to frequent Babur on Queen St. (right near CITY TV) but of late have been really disappointed.  

I finally found another small harbour to indulge my love for Indian food and that would be Chutney's on Bloor St. W (west of Royal York, near Montgomery).  The place is absolutely spotless, with pristine, crisp white linen on the tables.  When the server places the plate on the table they always hold the plate by a cloth napkin.  So polite.  

The chicken dishes are all great, be it Saffron Chicken, Butter Chicken or Saag Chicken (it's green so if you don't like spinach avoid this one altogether!)  One of my most favorite vegetable dishes is the Eggplant Patiala, it's got an attitude.  We'll often order the seafood curry which has four different kinds of fish/shellfish in a really lovely coconut curry sauce.  Apps are all decent but I am very partial to the Onion Bhajia.  They are crispy and the chickpea crust isn't soggy or oily.  I hate when the first thing you can taste is the oil.  Pulao is also good but I resent paying $6-$9 dollars for basically a rice dish so we usually just go with basmati.  Naan is made fresh and there is nothing more comforting than soaking up the saffron sauce from the chicken with a piece of fresh hot naan.  

The wait staff will ask you how you like the temperature of your indian food, I'm in the middle of the road.  I'm getting old and I am so not into the burning ring of fire the next day.  The restaurant always serves up a shot of Mango Lasshi (sp?) with a small shot of liquer in it as a compliment.  

Chutney's offers a take out bargain.  If you order your dinner between 4:00-5:00 (even though I don't pick it up until around 6 p.m. on my way home from work) they offer a 35% discount.  What a bargain.  I have taken home a killer takeaway Indian dinner for about $38.00  We've always got a few leftovers for lunch at work the next day."}
{"text":"Good things come to those who wait.

The restaurant opens at 4PM I showed up at 4:10 and the doors were still locked. So I called their number and the people inside didn't even know that the doors were still locked. 

I was the first person there. I make a take out order for some Chicken and Rice dish with a side order of Naan.  5 minutes later 2 other people came in and ordered separately for take out.

I'm pretty patient so I take a seat and start reading the Toronto Star they had at the back table. At about 4:30 a person who appeared to be the owner walked in and seemed upset that I was reading \"his\" paper.

Time passes, 4:45, 5 PM...the 2 people who ordered after me have just left. at 5:10 , the owner comes to me and says they forget to prepare my order and said he would rush it.  

The place had a werid contrast to it. The staff seemed to have no idea how to run a restaurant but at the same time the place as very clean, and the food was great.

Added bonus if you order takeout between 4-5PM you get a 35% discount.

4 stars if they would have shown 1 ounce of empathy when I was very patient for over 1 hour"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I don't come here as often anymore b/c I don't spend as much time in Bloor West as I have in the past.

I love their zucchini masala - I haven't found another place that serves it, and it's super delish.

Their butter chicken is also good.  Haven't had a bad dish here yet!

Yummy!"}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is a bit more formal than many, with a storefront decorated in elegant gold and white.  It is also a little more expensive than some.  But that is due to both the superlative cooking and the enormous portions.

The chicken dishes, especially the stuffed ones are rich and sumptuous.  A biryani was not only expertly prepared and seasoned but so generous that the remains made a nice lunch the next day.  Even simple samosas were great.  As other reviewer mentioned, they have takeout too.   This is not a place for fast dining - last visit our food took a bit of time when they weren't too busy.  I took that as being positive in that evidently at least some of it was being prepared from scratch.

Since the staff asks how spicy you want the dishes, it's a good place to introduce someone to Indian food.  They seem to have a loyal following as the owner greeted a number of customers by name on our last visit.

The service is very friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"Feeling adventurous last evening, my boyfriend and I decided to deviate from our favourite local Indian take-out spot (Indian Kiss) and try something new.  We both agree the subway ride was 100% worth while, because Chutneys has possibly the best Indian food I've ever had in my life (and I've tried a lot of variations!).

The restaurant itself is cozy and tastefully decorated with crisp white table cloths.  It's not just a hole in the wall, but somewhere you'd feel good about coming for a date night or special event.  Our server Svetlana was exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  

We ordered Onion Bhajia and Kastoori Paneer Tikka to start.  Before they arrived we were served papadams with mint sauce; they were baked just right, crispy and flavourful.  Our appetizers came out shortly after, both were delicious.  We love paneer and had never seen this variation.  It's coated in a green spicy mint sauce and then bbqed in the Tandoori oven until slightly charred around the edges.  It then comes out served on a sizzling plate with onions and peppers.  Delicious!

For the mains, we chose signature dishes, which they have a number of.  It's nice to see that they have so many unique items on the menu, and not just the same old, butter chicken.  My boyfriend had the Lamb Shank Rajasthani which was amazing.....a large portion of spinach engulfing the lamb which was so tender it literally fell off the bone.  I had the Murgh Kalimirch, chicken in a spicy onion & black pepper sauce.  Accompanying these dishes we ordered both Garlic Naan and the Mixed Naan which is stuffed with a thin layer of cheese, onion and potatoes.  Everything was flavourful and delicious.  While basking in the afterglow of the amazing meal, we ordered a blueberry lassi to satisfy the sweet tooth, again somewhat unique.  We had said we were splitting it and our waitress was kind enough to bring it out in two smaller glasses.  I still prefer mango over blueberry but it was good none the less.

We were able to find no fault at all in Chutneys, from the ambiance, to the service and most of all the food!  We were even more excited to find out that they deliver and service our neighbourhood near Dundas West subway, perfect for a night in or out!"}
{"text":"I am not sure about all the positive reviews. We ordered take out today and had the worst Indian food ever.
We ordered \"Haryali Chicken Tikka\" which was dry and rubbery instead of being juicy and succulent. It was so bad that it tasted like leftover food that was reheated.

We also had \"Rogan Josh\" which is a lamb curry. Lamb was severely over cooked and the curry was disgusting.

The \"Raita\" was watered down and was smelly.

The \"Naans\" were not bad. 

All in all I would never eat here again. So grossed out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite indian restaurants in the GTA. Staff are friendly, the dishes are flavourful. Definitely a quality restaurant and recommend to all to try."}
{"text":"Good place but i feel this place has gone down over the last year or two.  The quality of the food is good but dishes like he butter chicken almost taste as if ketchup is used.   Used to be far more fragrant and fresh tasting.  I have been going here for about 10 years and I would have given a 4 star rating a couple of years back but not any more.  

I don't know if I will go back or try finding a new go to for Indian somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best Indian food this side of town for sure.  Food is great and the service is very quick and friendly!  The naan fresh out of the oven are scrumptous and all of the standard indian dishes we tried were yummy.    Overally prices are reasonable.  Eating in is better than their take-out, but still worth it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to chutneys.  I highly recommend it.  We had onion bhajia, butter chicken, Tika masala.  Naan and rice are extra. We did not have dessert or drinks.  All in, less than $50.  Service was very nice also."}
{"text":"OMG I made the mistake of not reading the reviews that are not recommended and I am sure I will pay dearly in a few hours. I can already feel my tummy start to turn and I'm sweating like a pig.

Today I ordered chicken pakoras, seek kebab, garlic naan and gulab jamuns. Let me first say that there is not a chance that this food was prepared today. The kebabs were dry and burned, over cooked and tasted off. The chicken pakora was all batter and hard as a rock. I doubt this is real chicken either. The gulab jamuns were definitely old and rancid and I had to run to the can to spit it out. This meal was easily the nastiest meal I have ever had.
Save yourself the time of being hunched over the toilet for hours and avoid this disgraceful restaurant. The food is outright disgusting. How has this restaurant been in business for so long and who in their right mind would eat this rubbish?!?!?!

UPDATE:
I just couldn't resist calling the restaurant and when I said that there was no way the food was prepared today the woman said that they prepare many items in advance and then freeze them - specifically the items cooked in the tandoor over. Like how crazy is that!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive but great Indian food.

Lamb Korma: Great creamy sauce with big chunks of lamb. Definitely recommend.

Beef Vindaloo: Moderately spicy is a great way to go if you want some kick. Meat was delicious in sauce. Would recommend as well.

Naan: Nah, don't order. Nothing special and overpriced.

Overall score: 8/10."}
{"text":"This is my new 'go to' Indian restaurant, which in a way is unfortunate, as it's nowhere near my house.  My major complaint with other Indian restaurants is that I find the food needlessly oily.  Chutney's prepares things from scratch to order, and is sparing with its use of oil and ghee.  Which is not to say the food is flavourless--  all of the dishes i've tried have been delicious; and it's not one of those places where they give you mild when you ask for hot.   (What's up with that at 90% of Toronto restaurants?  I do not need your paternalism vis-a-vis my spice levels, thanks). 
Chutney's has a fairly elegant decor as these things go.  The service I've found to be mixed-- generally very nice, but some puzzling miscommunications at times.  Anyway, still worth the trip to Etobicoke.  Big discount if you takeout between 4-5.  (Admittedly that's a weird time to eat dinner unless you're Seinfeld's parents.)"}
