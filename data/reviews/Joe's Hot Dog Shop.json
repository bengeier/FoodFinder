{"text":"We love this place! The owner and employees always so nice, and the hot dogs never disappoint. I've tried just about every specialty dog they have and all have been fantastic.  If your looking for fancy, go to a steakhouse. But if you want an authetic hot dog shoppe feel, with a menu that offers items for every taste bud, Joe's is your place!"}
{"text":"Their hot dogs are pretty good. Nothing extraordinary, just a decent hot dog. They offer a nice variety of toppings and the prices are reasonable. Definitely not a bad choice if you are in the mood for a hot dog."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try a \"Hot Dog Place\".  I think from an expectations standpoint, I was looking for something along the lines of Hot Doug's in Chicago...gourmet \"encased meats\".  This is not gourmet encased meats.  This...per the name...is a hot dog shop.    The hot dogs were good, the prices were reasonable, and there were lots of options.  Was there a fois gras option?  No.  Were there duck fat fries?  No.  It is very much a hot dog shop, and not...what...a hot dog shoppe (the extra p and e make it fancy-like).  Waitress was nice, food was served quickly, tasted good, and was cheap.  Very much a good experience."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch.  Having past Joe's many times, decide to stop because I was hungry for a good dog.  Nice clean shop.  Rather new building.  Just down the road form Juliano's Pizza.  There is outdoor seating that will be nice in warmer weather.  The menu has dogs, sausage, burgers, soups.  The waiter at the counter was very friendly and helpful; pointing out the homemade soups and specials including a kielbasa burger.    Chose the hot dog combo which includes onion rings and a drink.  Joe's serves Smith's Hotdogs, a family owned business know for quality out of Erie, PA.    Brett Keisel...#99 of the Black and Gold is a spokesperson for Smith's.    The hot dogs are 100% beef  and you can order the skinless or a the snappie which has a natural casing.  Nothing fancy about the dogs with the typical toppings/condiments available.  The dogs were good, on fresh buns.  The onion rings were so-so.  Tasted like the frozen type that were dropped in a fryer for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Clean place where you can enjoy a variety of hot dog specialties. Indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a drive-thru for those on the go. Joe's uses Smith's hot dogs, the very same dogs served at Consol Energy Center at Pittsburgh Penguins games.  Joe's now serves breakfast, too!"}
