{"text":"This place is great! It's wonderful to find a homestyle Japanese place in the neighbourhood. I stumbled in right before their 4pm closing hour, but they stayed open for me! And service was still so friendly! Today I tried the pork cutlet curry, which was thick and tender. It's a whole pork chop, fried to a light, airy crisp. No sogginess here! The curry was rich and spicy, and the rice tender and creamy. These are simple things, but they're easy to get wrong or to cut corners on. But Sakawa does them right!

I can't wait to go back and try the traditional Japanese breakfast. I wish they delivered; I have a feeling I'd become a repeat customer. But I also appreciate that they have offerings for both warm and cold seasons -- the ramen and curry are great for winter days, and I'm looking forward to trying the matcha sundae and iced drinks in the summer.  The coffee selection also looks delightful."}
{"text":"This is a great place for homestyle Japanese food. The lunch menu has me going back for more - especially the Japanese Chicken Curry lunch. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Had the traditional breakfast with mackerel and a pour over coffee. One of the best brunches I've had for quite some time. Will definitely be back to try some more options."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to relax and enjoy Japanese comfort food. A breath of fresh air from the other pedestrian Japanese offerings on the Danforth. Naomi can make one of the best coffees on the strip.The austere ascetics  compliment the casual atmosphere.This is the only place that offers a Japanese breakfast in the City.

Great value and wonderful people.
Look forward to going again...Cheese cake!!"}
{"text":"pretty nice place! i happened to be in the area and decided to pop in after checking the reviews, since i'm always on the lookout for japanese restaurants: especially ones that serve up things other than the standard sushi/teriyaki/tempura. i came with a friend and we both ordered the hamburg. we both enjoyed it: the meat was soft and well-seasoned, and the sauce was quite nice: it tasted like demiglace mixed with ketchup. 

we came on tuesday evening for dinner, and it was pretty quiet: a few couples/groups came in, but overall the ambience was pretty quiet other than the other customers' chatting. 

i plan to come back to try some of their other dishes, like katsudon and omurice!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on the recommendation of a few friends. This small,  unassuming cafe is a must try. We had the karaage appetizer and the spaghetti (generous portion) in meat sauce. The service, food and hot sake were all perfect. We have a new go-to place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Sakawa is a new cafe by the owner of Sakawaya, a lovely little Japanese restaurant which used to occupy the same space several years ago.  What I loved about Sakawaya was the great home-style cooking, the high quality of the food, and the exceptionally friendly staff; and I am glad to see that the new Sakawa has retained all of these qualities, and more.  

I went for lunch with my wife today and we both tried out the traditional Japanese breakfast.  As far as I know, this is the only place in Toronto to get a Japanese breakfast, so we were very keen to try it.  It consists of either grilled fish or veggies, salad, miso, a little sushi-style egg, and rice.  I got the fish and my wife got the veggie (which was tofu and mushrooms) and both were wonderful.  My salmon was salty and grilled to perfection, and my wife's tofu and mushrooms were a smokey, rich savory flavour.  The miso soup and salad were excellent - I always appreciate a restaurant that takes the effort to do the basics really well, and the server also gave us a free sample of their steamed cheese bun, which is lightly sweet and spongy in the style of a Chinese bun.  My overall impression of the food was that it is unpretentious, simply delicious, and well made, and I will definitely be coming back often.

They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and other dishes include some Japanese staples like curry, katsu, onigiri, with a number of lunch specials.  They had a menu of several artisanal single source coffees, and the service was excellent: our food came quickly and the woman running the front of the restaurant was very friendly.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for the take-out sushi and the onigiri.  The decor is simple and functional.  For anyone with disabilities, there is no step to get in but the bathroom is in the basement."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Japanese comfort food. My husband tried their curry with a pork cutlet, I had the katsu don and we ordered some gyoza to share. All were wonderful, and very reasonably priced considering the portion size. 

Sakawa makes their katsu with real pork chops (as opposed to the processed cutlets some places use). It's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, just as it should be, and was perfect both with egg and rice in my katsu don and with the thick curry sauce on my husband's dish. 

Both dishes also came with a small green salad, miso soup and a bowl of tofu in meat sauce, which we also thoroughly enjoyed. 

As for the gyoza, they were spot-on, with a delicate wrapper, generously spiced meat filling and perfectly crispy bottom.

All in all, a simple but satisfying meal for a good price, and great service to boot.

I skipped the coffee and dessert since it was already late and I was too full from dinner, but will definitely be back to see if their lattes are as good as everything else!"}
{"text":"Sakawa is a Japanese Bistro/coffee house.   The small dinner menu has a mixture of rice dishes, ramens and apps.   

They were participating in Summerlicious, but we order off the regular menu.  

The food were plated nicely, but I thought it took a lot longer than it should and came out in different time.  

Takoyaki (octopus balls)
Shoyu (soya) Ramen
Tonkotsu (pork) Ramen
Katsudon (pork cutlet with egg on rice)
Matcha Cheesecake

I really wanted to like this place but didn't find the food all that special.  Perhaps I will give it another try when Summerlicious is over as they appear to be focused on the Summerlicious menu, as people who ordered off that got their food very quickly."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly atmosphere and awesome desserts!"}
{"text":"You want to eat Japanese food?
Come here and try it out.
Nowadays, many Japanese people tend to open Izakaya style bars and Ramen restaurants in Toronto, but most of them are so expensive for the potion size and I always feel they're overpriced...

Sarawak has many affordable and delicious foods.
My favorite is Katsu Don (deep fried pork on rice).
Hand drip coffee is also nice. I often drop by just to get coffee."}
{"text":"Sakawa is one of those unexpected gems. You'd never expect much by the appearance of the place, but the food is absolutely fantastic! The matcha sundae is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Prices are very affordable, the coffee is delicious (their iced latte is so much better than Starbucks). 
This has very quickly become my new favourite spot on the Danforth. 
The owners are such friendly, good people. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to Sakawa Coffee for dinner on Saturday night and it was delicious! The food was great, service was a little awkward but I think it was the Japanese service experience. Our bill came to $45 including tax and tip for a shared starter, two mains, a small sake, and a shared dessert (get the matcha sundae). The atmosphere is definitely casual but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Foods were good. Dessert, which was the custard pudding, was good. Prices were reasonable.  I am a Japanese and I am saying foods are good, so they are good. However, a chef or a cashier, I was not sure which he is, he was very depressed looking and it made me feel depressed."}
{"text":"Truly a place for Japanese comfort food, I was thrilled to find this place only a 10 minute drive from the circus studio I visited.

There's room for maybe 15 - 20 customers and it felt like I was being welcomed into the staff's home for a homecooked meal. Our group of three managed to try the omurice, the katsu don, the pork katsu curry, the chicken karaage, and then the amazing matcha sundae.

I loved my omurice. It screams homecooked and the serving sizes for all the dishes were generous for the price. The matcha sundae was a treat--the matcha crepe was awesome, as was the matcha ice cream. Overall a really amazing meal for really cheap once converted to USD.

Wish I could take this little shop with me to Boston--I definitely will be back in the future when I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been desperately wanting to try this place for the longest time, but unfortunately it's located on the Danforth and I come to this area...like never. Finally made up my mind to just go anyway, and in my opinion it was worth the trip!

To be honest, the food wasn't THAT exceptional (I got the omurice and it's really just rice, egg, and ketchup), though it is of course good. And portions are filling. But everything else made me really, really enjoy it here, which is the reason for the full 5-stars. To start with, the waitresses (both of them present) were probably the most smiley or the happiest servers I have ever seen. I was greeted in Japanese and thanked when I entered, when food arrived, when I paid, when I left, and probably at other times too. You couldn't help but feel absolutely welcomed and comfortable. No prompting was needed for anything from menu to water to food, which came out very quickly and piping hot. I asked a bunch of questions regarding their various menus, and received very patient answers (always with a smile!).

One thing that surprised me was that there was no coffee menu provided until I explicitly mentioned it, nor is it anywhere on the website. But the drip coffee I ordered was not bad - though my senses may have been dulled significantly by an abundance of office and Tim Hortons coffee. Prices seem to be reasonable, so give it a try.

By the way, I think they serve their breakfast menu all day - or you can certainly request from it, I really can't see the waitress denying you. Also, 10% off Yelp offer is still valid!"}
{"text":"What a fun addition to the Danforth. Thus far I've only had the pleasure of trying their tea and dessert, but its definitely been bookmarked for future visits. From my limited experience, Sakawa offers good value and quality ingredients.

On my visit, I ordered a genmai tea and received a French press full of tea leaves versus the usual mug and teabag. I also paired it with a matcha millecrepe, which I was surprised to find here, since it's such a Labour intensive cake. The millecrepe was not bad for the setting, but if you're looking to specifically try a millecrepe, it may be worthwhile to get to Millie Creperie or Roselle. 

A friend ordered the strawberry cheesecake, and it looked different from a western style cake. Instead of being more homogenous, this cheesecake seems to have a couple delicate layers---a thin sponge cake and the usual cheese layer---curious and tasty.

Looking forward to revisiting this gem and trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese family recipe I have ever found in Toronto. If you looking for high-end Japanese food like sushi or sashimi, don't go there. But it is definitely what Japanese people eat in there normal basis. And definitely a place to try if you are into Japanese family food."}
{"text":"Curry Pork Katsu was delicious.  The sauce could have been warmer.  Some of the sauce bits were coagulated instead of having a smooth consistency throughout.  I would have liked some pickles to go with the dish as is traditional.  The salad was a nice gesture but really uninteresting and the dressing reminded me of the look and consistency of white school glue.  I would have preferred a simple soup to go with or just some pickles to compliment the curry.  Back to the curry sauce...it was good and reminded me of Japan, but a little too sweet.  I came for lunch so it was a bit busy with one server.  I tried to get her attention (in this small cafe) to ask for tea but wasn't heard.  She was on a mission.  Luckily she came back to ask how I was enjoying my lunch and switched it up for a Coke.  Probably should have ordered a tea since it was kind of a cold day.  Oh, March, please bring Spring....Looks like a pretty busy spot for lunch with a few drop ins ordering take out and simple items like coffee and pastries.  Almost everyone who came in seemed like regulars.  I'll be back since I'm always in this area and I miss Japanese home cooking, having lived in Japan for 4 years.  Highly recommend Sakawa."}
{"text":"Don't get the hype??! Dropped by there on a weekday, noodle was lack of flavor and cake wasn't fresh or tasty at all. Hmmmm"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Authentic and reasonably priced Japanese comfort food. Tastes like home cooked food. The katsu, ramen, appetizers, cakes, and coffee are all amazing. Very quiet atmosphere and friendly service. They have breakfast too!"}
{"text":"Japanese style home cooked meal~ affordable price, great food, great customer services. I ordered grilled saba, ramen, rice ball, gyoza and barley tea. Highly recommend the grilled saba as it is so delicious, juicy with a hint of charcoal flavor. Ramen still needs a bit of improvement as the broth is not as hot as it supposed to be. Overall, the food is great and definitely will visit again. 

* friendly suggestion to the owner: the lighting is a bit weird in the restaurant. it is not as warm as most of the other cafes. Hopefully, it can be fixed as to attract more customers."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time and I loved it. They have authentic and traditional Japanese dishes. The prices were reasonable!"}
{"text":"Such a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Friendly staff, delicious food. Even some hard-to-find Japanese beer from Hitachino. Was sad to see 7 Dim Sum move, but thrilled Sakawa is here!"}
{"text":"Love sakawa coffee! Japanese breakfast is my go to. Dinner is also good. Love the staff and the music is always so great for the experience (jazz and bossa). Love it here."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food & portions plus cheap prices! Love their Deep Fried combo and the match latte! I came back twice for that already.
Can't wait to go back and explore more from their menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were walking on the Danforth one day and passed by Sakawa Cafe on our way to another place. The menu immediately caught my eye. They serve traditional Japanese food. The kind I would eat at my Grandma's house and not a typical restaurant. You just can't find many places  where you can have chicken katsu with curry over rice. It's pure comfort food.

It was absolutely delicious and we actually ended up meeting some other people who had discovered it a month before us. They've since become regulars and I'm sure we'll be the same. We had cappuccinos to go after our email and that was excellent as well. 

If you're looking for fancy or think Japanese food is tempura and California rolls, then this is not your spot. But if you are looking for an authentic Japanese meal, this is the only place in Toronto that I know of where you can find it. 

Will definitely be a frequent visitor there!"}
{"text":"I came here last night to have dinner based on these reviews that I have seen here. The only reason why I even bother giving this place 2 stars is because the ramen that was ordered by my companion tasted okay. 
The first things I noticed stepping in the restaurant was the awful smell. It was like a dirty washroom. The floor and the table was sticky. But, I stayed hoping that maybe the food would be good. I ordered chicken karaage for appetizer chicken cutlet curry for main. My fiancé  order ramen. When the food came, the chicken karaage and the chicken in my curry was the same chicken. It should have been chicken cutlet with the curry. The chicken was bland. There was a sour taste in my curry. I am pretty sure the carrots in the curry was bad. I have had japanese curry before and never had it tasting sour. Avoid this place unless you enjoy listening  to heavy metal music, eating spoiled food in a smelly restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute Japanese-run mom and pop restaurant on the Danforth. Came here with a group of 20 people. The waitress was extremely nice and their menu has a good variety of options to select from. I think I'll come back here again with a smaller group so as not to overwhelm the kitchen and staff here.

I ordered dumplings, tonkotsu ramen and matcha Sunday. The portion size was huge and the broth was savour and not too heavy (you can tell there wasn't alot of msg). I couldn't finish all my food and there were lots of cha shu slices. My friend ordered a green tea genmaicha with his meal which I would highly recommend. For the price of $2 it comes in a French press and very high quality genmaicha. For dessert you must absolutely order the matcha Sunday! It is $5.95 and comes with two scoops of green tea ice cream, fruits and four pieces of soft sweet pancake. Such a great value!

The place is not very big. Four tables of 4 max so I don't recommend this place for big groups. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star instead of 5 is because the service was slow because our group was so big. It took a while for the bill to come since we were splitting bills and the waitress was writing them each out by hand."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unassuming places I've eaten at. If a friend didn't tell me about it, I probably would never have noticed it since it's on a less busy strip of the Danforth. 

I tried their Chanpon Ramen with seafood and it was really delicious, a nice light flavoured broth and not too heavy even though it's milk-based. I also loved all the vegetables in it. They weren't treated like they were an afterthought. You can tell they were prepared separately before being added to the ramen, the Japanese eggplant was really yummy. I also tried their Shimesaba appetizer of cured mackerel which was also really delicious. I was expecting a strong vinegar/salt taste but was delightfully surprised by the mild flavour of the rice wine vinegar and soft and moist texture of the fish. Also finished with their matcha NY style cheesecake which I think was a bit too dense but it had a very good flavour.  

The space itself is quite small and it is super casual. It serves really good Japanese comfort food in a relaxed setting (don't expect everyone to yell at you like an izakaya). It's a really good neighborhood spot with nice and friendly service. I want to go back to try their Japanese breakfast set or their katsu curry, I saw another table order it and it looked really good! Prices are really affordable here too, with mains in the ~$10--$15 range. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Overally my experience was good. Will return.
I will note that the restaurant has a bad smell. Maybe something to do with their ventilation? I hope the Owners will look into this. Service was prompt and friendly. 

What I ate:
- Japanese breakfast with salmon: It was simple but delicious. I will mention that the size of the salmon was a tad small and the side dishes it came with was a lil uninspiring.
- Omelette rice: Big portion. Tasted good- the sauce they used seemed house made. No real compaints here."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent. Try their Hamburg steak with curry. Curry has a nice kick to it, lots of flavour. Delicious! The grilled black cod is a must try as well. Fish cooked perfectly, buttery and flavourful. Portions are good, and food is always fresh.


Service is always attentive, they're very friendly. 

Must try:rice balls. I always buy them for next day lunch. 

Worth visiting."}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear about this place as I love Japanese Yoshoku foods.  If you aren't familiar with the term, yoshoku refers to western-influenced Japanese food.  This includes Japanese curries, pork cutlets, pastas, and hamburg steaks.

I came here twice.  The first time, I ordered the Hamburg Steak meal.  It included miso soup, salad, a small side dish featuring enoki mushrooms.   The included sides were pretty decently sized given the price of the meal.

I've made hamburg steak at home and the recipe I use typically includes pork, beef, onions, panko bread crumbs and tonkatsu sauce.  The hamburg steak was decent and there was nothing really to complain about and is served with some potatoes and rice.

I also tried my partner's omurice, an omelette-style dinner filled with fried rice.  Again, it was pretty decent, and nothing to complain about.

The second time I came back, I ordered a chicken onion don bowl.  It came with the same sides as last time except instead of the mushroom side dish, it was a tofu-based one.  The don bowl was pretty good and I don't really have any complaints about it.  We finished off with some NY-style cheese cake.

In terms of ambiance, it's a little dated and seating is limited.  It wasn't busy either time I went so space wasn't an issue.

So, why 3 stars?  I was a bit disappointed in how they handled an issue with the salad.  One of the leaves clearly was mouldy.  When I pointed this out to the server, he apologized and took the salad away.  It wasn't acknowledged afterwards - not even an offer to replace the salad that was barely touched.

The food could use some work for sure, but in the end, the mould sort of ruined any appetite I had for coming back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little gem I found today! I was looking for a nice little place to have some breakfast and wow there Japanese breakfast with salmon was so good! Also had there rice balls with salmon and for $2 so filling! Super friendly customer service as well! Would recommend to family and friends to come!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere for late night meals  big portions of food for what you pay for, very cost worthy !"}
{"text":"The gf brought me here for a surprise b day breakfast.

Sakawa is such a nice, quaint hidden gem of a restaurant. We came here on a Sunday morning and it was the perfect brunch spot - nice and cozy with natural sunlight shining through the front windows.

I ordered the omurice and drip coffee, while the gf ordered pork katsu and a matcha latte. Everything was great. I would recommend the pork katsu - I couldn't help but steal spoonfuls of curry off my gf's plate. The drip coffee was also excellent, not the least bit bitter.

To top it all off, they offer a 10% discount if you check-in on Yelp. Also, there's ample street parking, and it's free on Sunday mornings before 1pm, I believe."}
{"text":"Impulsively dropped in as we were in the area. Quiet, as it was a long weekend. Small shop, we ordered omu rice and curry ramen-- pretty decent size portions and flavourful.

What stands out for this family run business is the excellent SERVICE. Waitress so friendly, in showing pictures on the menu, happily explaining the dishes, always filling our waters, asking us how our food is, giving us little dessert samples. This is the type of restaurant you go to because you feel welcomed and so homey."}
{"text":"Considering it's the middle of Danforth, and there's a Japanese restaurant here? It's good for Japanese food. If you are craving ramen, curry, katsu dishes etc. The price can be high if you choose the fancier dishes. Size and food is plentiful. Definitely a hidden spot for Japanese food. I have only ordered their noodle soups and rice dishes here. I have also ordered onigiri to go - not really a huge fan of it though. But the staff here are very nice and accomodating if you need special requests. Will continue to come here for comfort meal, they also have lattes!"}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 9.5/10
Drink: 9.5/10
Service: 9/10
Value: 9/10
Hygiene: 10/10
Aesthetics: 8/10

I have been craving yoshoku style food for a while and decided to come here with some friends. What started off as a group of 8 people ended up being almost 20 people in total. I apologize to all the people that were unable to go eat that day, and to the owners who were probably not prepared for a group to fill their entire restaurant. So for a store with only 2 people in the kitchen, I'm sure it must've been overwhelming. That being said, there was no lack of quality in the food.

The food was great, we had the gyoza, katsu curry, tonkotsu ramen, a matcha latte, and a matcha sundae. The curry was flavourful and the tonkatsu was cooked perfectly, the cutlet was light and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Also, you can tell the pork they use is great quality when you take a bite. The ramen broth is good, not overwhelmingly rich, but enough to leave a nice umami aftertaste.

The matcha latte was equally good. The matcha was strong and flavourful, but the typical bitterness of matcha was not present. It wasn't too sweet, but if you're not a fan of sweet, you may want to ask for one of the other various options they offer. 

The service was very friendly and accommodating. Thanks for being patient with our group! 

The restaurant itself looks like a coffee shop with seating for about 20-25 people in total, and it doesn't have anything that stands out, but it has a really homelike feeling which considering the food is probably right. The washrooms are a little short, but that's due to the building. Just make sure to watch your head! I would recommend them to maybe get a better PoS system, cause the poor waitress ended up splitting our bills and writing them by hand. 

The prices are decent and the food is great. The service is splendid. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"WOW! Easily five stars. What a hidden gem in Greektown. I never thought I could find a good, homey Japanese resto, and yes run by Japanese, in this area. I am so tired of getting ripped off at all these generic \"sushi\" or \"izakaya\" places. Here, you get homemade style Japanese meals at affordable prices. 

Let's get straight to food. I went here for dinner on Sunday with my boyfriend. Their dinner menu is about the same as lunch except you get it cheaper for lunch. Any main dish comes with a side of salad, miso soup, and a side dish. The side dish we got was soft tofu with some spicy sauce, soy sauce, topped with bamboo shoots and minced pork. This side dish def was a pleasant surprise! I ordered one of their specials (forgot the name of it). Everything on the menu (dinner) was under $12, and generous portions! My dish was basically stir-fried shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken with veggies with starchy sauce poured over rice and topped with a whole seasoned egg. SO MUCH PROTEIN and FRESH VEGGIES packed with flavour!!!! The egg was cooked and seasoned to the perfection. I loved everything about this dish AND ONLY for $9.5 (remember I got salad, miso soup and the tofu side dish) for DINNER. I felt bad for being charged too little for the quality and quantity of food I got... my boyfriend ordered curry rice with tonkatsu ($10.5) Again, this dish was also solid, flavourful curry, a generous amount of toppings in the curry, and thick tonkatsu. 

I mean seriously, I am so thankful to find out about this place. I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I had Japanese breakfast with mackerel and it was very good. Boiled egg was flavored very nicely but still soft inside. It was amazing. I'm Japanese and grew up there, so it was quite nostalgic to eat the breakfast. It reminded me of old style \"kissa\"= cafe who serves meals. Their coffee is also great. I picked Ethiopian beans from the choice and very tasty. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. I'll be going back there for sure."}
{"text":"We were here for a late lunch today. Authenticity comes to mind with this place. I had the tonkatsu ramen and the katsu rice (w the steamed egg and onions). Everything was delicious.
Then there's the coffee. There was a great selection of beans which I uploaded the menu of (that day). The cafe part of this establishment is no joke. They make a serious cappuccino. I'd come here just for the coffee."}
{"text":"So great - the lady who's always FoH is lovely, and the authentic menu made my Japanese boyfriend very happy. Aaand the food tastes great! So glad it's in my neighbourhood, as I'm sure I'll be a regular here :) please stay forever!"}
{"text":"This place serves Japanese style western food, but they do give us choices of Japanese ramen too.

Japanese beers such as Sapporo, Kirin and Asahi is available.  They have Asahi on draft too.

You can come here for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  There are special combo menus for all 3 sessions at very reasonable prices.

They have dessert like cheese cake, ice cream, etc.  I did not try their desserts yet so I can't tell if they are good or not.  

Their food is made very home-style and I love to go there whenever I'm in the mood for omurice, Japanese curry and ramen.

Hmmm, I haven't yet tried their coffee.  I'm pretty sure I will go again soon:)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but it was 3/5 for me. We ordered mackerel pieces for apps. This was good. After, I got the ramen and my partner got the Katsu don (fried pork). The ramen broth wasn't too salty but the pork belly was dry. The fried pork was hard and didn't seem fresh. We ordered a piece of Millie crepe and green tea short bread for dessert. The Millie crepe was average. You can taste the green tea flavour but I don't think the crepes were fresh. The green tea short bread was flavourful. 

If you show your Yelp, you get a 10% off.

They also serve their own beer. We didn't try it but perhaps if we come again, we will.

I want to give this place another chance because they serve casual Japanese dishes, but they didn't blow me away despite all the good reviews."}
{"text":"The taste is ordinary compared with the dishes I ate before in HK. Not sure the standard in Toronto."}
{"text":"Definition of hidden gem. Came here on a business brunch and I was super excited and impressed. It's a small little cafe/restaurant that offers great traditional Japanese food such as omurice, katsu, and even Japanese breakfast! They also have different kinds of fair trade coffee beans for those who are into that. 

I got the Japanese breakfast of course, with mackerel and a side of natto, which for some reason I don't see too often other than at Manpuku. I am 100% for savoury breakfasts and it doesn't get any savoury than a piece of mackerel. I also got a genmaicha that was served with a cute individual tea press that I pretended to know how to use. 

I swear this placed is run by only 3 people, one waitress and two cooks who also have to come out to serve the food when busy. I don't think one should expect a quick meal here. Come when you want to have a leisurely chat with friends or if you're going solo then a place to enjoy your time with yummy food. I will have to come during their dinner service to try out their other food!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Sakawa but I will try my best in this review.

Ever since a trip I did to Japan I have been left craving certain Japanese foods like their \"comfort food\" and traditional Japanese breakfast. When I saw that Sakawa specialized in these kinds of food I had to visit. 

So I've be here to Sakawa a few times now. The service is always excellent. The space inside is very nice and comfortable though during peak times it can get very busy. Even still the service is always good and the food is always delicious and arrives quickly.

I have had the Karaage with curry which was amazing. The Karaage was cooked perfectly and the curry was very flavorful. 
I've ordered the traditional breakfast with Mackerel twice. The second time I added a Soft boiled egg and Natto. The egg was cooked perfectly and the Natto, which looked to be Hikiwari style, was also perfect. The mackerel is grilled to perfection and is delicious.  
I've also tried a Onigiri and a Matcha cake. Both were very good.

Oh! ...and their drip coffee is also very good."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Danforth. I heard about it from the Bento Box magazine and saw that they had Hamburg steak so I decided to check it out. 

?Decor?: Clean, small, simple design,  and seats about 15 people max. 

Bit of background: I've travelled to Japan before and like to call myself sort of a Hamburg steak expert (maybe). So my sole purpose was to try the Hamburg steak here. 

Their hamburg steak comes in three variations:
1. Lunch: 180g patty with rice 
2. Lunch: 220g patty with rice
3. Dinner: 200g patty with rice, soup and salad 
*can add $1 for soup and salad for lunch

?Food?: having tried three other Hamburg steak places in T.O I would say that in terms of the patty Sakawa had the best. Other places (where they won't be named) has their patties either too floury tasting or too beefy tastIng. But Sakawa was perfect. In terms of the sauce they chose to use a tomato based sauce. Slightly different since In Japan, most Hamburg steaks uses a thicker gravy style sauce. The tomato based isn't bad but I hold a special place with the usual brown styled sauce.

?Service?: the lady gave me a small piece of a shortcake as a sample so that's a bonus.

It's unfortunate that the location is a bit far but I'll definitely come here again just for their Hamburg steaks. I would be interested to try their omurice too."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and cousins from England. They don't get Japanese style brunch over where they live, so I suggested this place to take them on an adventure. We drove all the way to the Jones/Danforth area from north Scarborough to go here. This is a small restaurant, but not too small. It's a good place to take someone on a date or with a few family members (like I did). We had the shumai (pork dumplings), gyoza (fried dumplings), and spring rolls for the appetizers. For our main meals, my two cousins both had omelettes with rice/bread combo, my mom had the big morning breakfast and I had the omurice. My cousin enjoyed the omelette (the salmon one) very much. All dishes were very tasty and fresh. My mom thought the hotcakes were just okay (granted my mom is used to sweeter pancakes), but she really enjoyed the salad. In the end, we all left full and satisfied and with a good impression. If you want great Japanese brunch, this is the place to go. It's not super hard to get to since it's right on Danforth and near Donlands Station if you're taking the subway. Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and have lunch here.  The ramen is fantastic, the Americano super smooth and matcha cheesecake the perfect light treat.  It's fiercely straight forward Japanese style meals and exactly what you want for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Servers always smiling and attentive. Food is fresh. My tonkatsu and octopus balls are cooked right."}
{"text":"Basically a hidden gem!  If this restaurant is open near queen street or uptown, lines will be out the doors!  Simple Japanese cafe serving comfort food menu that reminds me of Japan!  $8.50 omelette rice with ketchup and you can add a dollar for soup and salad.  Portion is big & you can pair your food with a $4.80 Kirin beer or $5 hot sake.  Will sure be back to try the breakfast and other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese comfort food! Big portions and value for your money. The staff there was friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on the danforth! We ordered the omu rice, hell's ramen (regular spicy), and a black coffee. 

We really enjoyed what we ordered esp the ramen. It's so good on a cold day. We ordered the regular spicy. The soup was flavourful and the noodle is quite delicious.   

Will definitely come back again and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Ambience:
Very calming, authentic. Pleasant jazz music. Reminds me of Japan! 

Food:
Good coffee. Had traditional breakfast. Good food - no complaints."}
{"text":"We went for the Japanese breakfast this weekend. My partner is Japanese and I'm half Japanese so we were excited to find a place like this in our neighbourhood. The salmon breakfast was very good. The salmon was cooked nicely and the miso soup was yummy. The salad dressing unfortunately tasted mostly like mayo. The green tea was a very good quality. We're looking forward to trying lunch and dinner. As a female I hope as they expand or change their menu there are less deep fried items. I know with only a husband and wife team deep frying is quick and easy but things like sweet potato slices for breakfast don't need to be deep fried."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here with a friend in December. Different from any Japanese place I've tried before... \"comfort food.\" Very delicious. Great service, too."}
{"text":"Down to earth restaurant and lovely one in the neighbourhood. 

We went here to have a lunch on a weekend. We ordered the Katsu Donburi and Curry Katsu with rice. They are both amazingly delicious. Before we leave, we ordered the cream cheese cake and a latte. My partner gave it a 4.5 stars for the latte he ordered but a 3.25 stars for the cake. 

We would like to come back again to this authentic Japanese cafe soon and try out the other dishes they offered."}
{"text":"I am being kind so I will rate Sakawa 4 out of 5. It could also be a 3 out of 5.

This is a Japanese café with all-day breakfast and select few yoshokou (western-style Japanese food) menu items.
I believe this restaurant is owned by the man behind the Bushi Udon restaurant uptown and an izakaya before that. Either way, the Japanese style breakfast of rice, fish and soup is interesting. They also have all-day Canadian breakfast.
However, the menu items are limited and are comprised of spaghetti, curry and rice dishes and donburi, which pork and rice or chicken and egg and rice, etc.
There is no karaage (fried chicken) on the menu, but they had Chinese dumplings (shiu mai!?!)!
My katsudon (rice and fried pork) was average. I suspect this is inauthentic, but the katsudon also had mushrooms in it. They had more taste and dashi than the one at Café Green Tea, but the pork was tough. The quantity was below average given the shallow size of the bowl.
$1 extra (katsudon is $8.50) gets one miso soup and salad, the latter was disappointing in that it was leafy lettuce and two slices of tomato and the dressing was pure mayonnaise.
They have something called Doriya, which I had not seen elsewhere in Toronto. It is like a ketchup gratin.
Soft drinks and juices are unavailable. There is obviously a menu of coffee variants and sake.

The waitress was very nice and friendly and greeted customers in and out in Japanese. Yes, they are actually Japanese. The other Japanese restaurant, which is almost across the street (Nakayoshi Izakaya) has a much bigger variety on its menu (of course, it's an izakaya) with very tasty and authentic items, but ironically has a Chinese chef and owner! Further west in the city is Coco, which has those tasty Karaage morsels.

For dessert they have generous portions of green tea or cheese cake that are actually baked in-house. Beware! They are quite filling.

The premises are quite simple and relatively clean, although several items had a coat of dust on them, and I was surprised to see a photo of Kyoto's 'Golden' Pavilion... in.... black and white.
By the way, Sakawa is a river in Saitama Prefecture near which the owner once lived."}
{"text":"Japanese food to me, is much more than just ramen and sushi.  After going to this place, it just provided further proof to support my statement.

Now mind you, I only had their dessert so I can't really comment too much on their food but to say that I am rather impressed at what they are offering.  As you walk in, it's a rather small cafe that seats no more than...25 ppl? But it's a very inviting place, with wooden tables and nice quiet environment.  There are few odd distorted panoramic pictures frames posted on the wall, but it gives it that slight quirkiness.

Even though I didn't have any of their main dishes or coffee, because I had just eaten my meal at another place...I will say that I will come back and try out their dishes.  They have Japanese curry rice (one of my all time favourite meals), omurice, customizable ramen and a whole bunch of dishes that are authentically Japan (literally what you would normally expect in Tokyo, is now transported over to Toronto).  Also do note that Japan, in many parts of their cuisine, draws an incredible amount of French influence.  Also, a small note, and I LOVED that this restaurant did this, but they provided a small legend on the menu, and one of the icons was the Japanese flag, which represented, which dishes were consider \"famous in Japan\".  There's something about that little detail that made me really happy, and a business who isn't strictly just feeding people but also giving small little tidbits on Japanese taste preferences.  

Good service too as well, the waitress taking our orders was patient, pleasant and helped answer questions (at least for my friends) who weren't as familiar with the menu.  Kudos to her being a good waitress to us :D

I ordered the Green Tea Sundae and I honestly thought it would be a small portion in a sundae cup.  Nope, it was an enormous plate with fruit, a fluffy pancake, two scoops of ice cream and whipped cream, which I had to beg my friends to assist me to finish.  It was HUGE, and delicious...and not too sweet, even with the chocolate sauce that was drizzled all over.  Really delicious!

I've already stated in this review that I'm coming back, so hopefully I'll have an updated one sometime soon.  Excellent place to check out. :)"}
{"text":"Sakawa Coffee is the hero eatery we (the Danforth) don't deserve! 

I've passed by on the way to work for months, and finally got to pop in for dinner tonight. We met up at six for an early meal of curry chicken and hamburg steak. Both mains come with rice, soup, salad, and a small daily side dish (today's was crispy sweet potato slices). I was starving walking in and so ready to double up on apps after the entrée, but was grateful that the gun was not jumped because it was actually a formidable portion for both of us. 

Sakawa's spot on flavours definitely did their tagline of \"comfort food and desserts\" justice. Simple dishes executed perfectly wins in my books any day. They brew a mean cup of coffee and the french press genmaicha was still going strong after a third steep. 

We finished off with the matcha sundae, which was as good as the pictures look and other reviewers make it sound. The crazy part was the $5.50 price tag. Having spent a small fortune (or at least the aggregate of a few weeks' pay) on Demetre's, Dolce Gelato, and Ed's to satisfy the separate and seemingly bottomless sweets stomach, this absolutely qualifies as a treasure find.  

Uncle Tetsu's and Tsujiri got all the press when the Japanese craze swept Toronto, but I would've honestly traded them (AND Muji AND Uniqlo) for half-decent Japanese in my area, let alone the excellent one that's come in the form of Sakawa. 

We're already determined to be regulars, see you soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurant on the Danforth. I had the Deep fried combo and also plain pancake for dessert. Hits all the right spots after a good run. The Deep fried combo would most light joy fill you up with deep fried pork, shrimp and salmon, comes with salad, soup and rice. The don't take the yelp 10% off anymore."}
{"text":"After stuffing my face with all kinds of desserts I was in need of a really good coffee..so I found this little Japanese gem who has recently gotten popular for their Drip coffee..and boy oh boy is it good! 

Aromatic, perfectly dripped don't know from where and how but is DAMN good coffee...I like mine black it was tasty, soothing as someone was massaging my temples...

Bravo Sakawa! Bravo. Best Drip Coffee in town."}
{"text":"Yummmy!!! I love coming here for their curry pork katsu  Glad we found this place! However street parking could be difficult to find..."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I came here with a large party and waitress was extremely kind! I even accidentally broke their glassware and they were so forgiving! Thanks for being so kind Sakawa!"}
{"text":"There is no excuse, under any circumstance, for hanging a piece of paper on the door of you BREAKFAST place saying that you decided not to bother opening till 11am for a whole month.  Drive for hours and arrived with hungry kids to find this door locked."}
{"text":"There's definitely a lot of good things to say about this place, but overall I can only give it 3.5 stars.

Had this place bookmarked for the longest time and I finally made it here this morning for brunch.  The place is small but it was fine since we were the only ones there this morning at 11am.  I brought my parents here as well since they were never able to visit me when I lived in Japan, I wanted them to experience some of the very Japanese local food that I used to eat which I can tell by some of Yelp reviews.

I was really hoping to give it 5 stars but there were a few dishes that fell short of expectations.  Here is what we ordered:

1) Drip coffee was tasty and smooth - 4/5
2) Latte/Matcha Latte - tasty but wasn't hot - 3/5
3) Shui Mai - home made - very good (this is Japanese style so don't compare it to Chinese dim sum) - 4/5
4) Gyoza - nothing special - 3/5
5) Japanese breakfast - perfectly done grilled mackerel - 4.5/5
6) Doria - best dish!  5/5 -we all loved this dish!
7) Hamburg with rice - a bit dry and lacking in taste - 3/5
8) Katsu don - 3.5/5 - nicely done!
9) Omu Rice - 3/5 - taste was only okay

We got excellent service and the food was prepared very promptly.   It was also very nice to get 10% off if you tell them you are a Yelp member.   It was a great find and if we are in the area, we would definitely be coming back.  We still need to try their curry dishes and desserts."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch, tried the katsu don. Vkusno! Oishii! Delicious! Perfect comfort food; served with miso soup. Will be back to try some of the other dishes, or maybe coffee and matcha cheesecake. There are also several vegetarian options on the menu for herbivores among us. The restaurant is small and unassuming; service is prompt."}
{"text":"I agree with other yelpers that this place is a hidden gem! Their signage does not mention anything about a Japanese restaurant but a cafe, it wouldn't cross your mind that they actually serve really good home made Japanese dishes. The owner runs the kitchen along with another guy (perhaps his apprentice), and a lady at the front that mans the cash, and serves the table. My husband and I waited for about 30 minutes before we were sat on a Sunday afternoon. The place is quite small, but they pump out the food pretty quickly.

My husband and I had:

Pork katsu with curry - really good hearty curry sauce that tastes home made. The pork katsu are juicy with a thin crispy breading. I will definitely try their beef curry next time.

Large Hamburg with cheese - the Hamburg is tender and flavorful. The sauce makes the dish, it has a nice tomato aroma but with layers of complexity. Please add the cheese for an additional $1, it's worthwhile!

My husband and I love this place, we will be back to try out their omurice, ramen and many other dishes. Before we sat down, we had such a dilemma in what we want to order. We wanted to try everything on their menu, but at least we made our choices."}
{"text":"The hubby ordered off of their special menu, the curry tsukemen.  And I ordered off their regular menu.  I wish I remembered to take a picture of the menu, because now I can't remember then name of the dish I ordered!  All I remember is that its the last dish on their regular menu.
The curry sauce for the tsukemen was very good and flavourful.  And the noodles, were different than the ramen noodles that I was used to eating.  These looked flat, almost like a linguine.  The chasiu was a bit dry, but once it was warmed with the curry, it got better.  And the best part, there were veggies in the dish!  Again, never seen choy sum in Japanese dishes, but I love my veggies, so I won't complain.
My dish, reminded me of Fukien style fried rice, without the fried rice part.  There was shrimp, chicken, ham, chasiu, onions, eggplant, peppers and choy sum in sauce of some sort served over plain Japanese rice.  Wasn't what I was expecting, but was quite good.
Overall, I liked this place quite a bit.  For the price that you pay and the food that you get, I think it's worth checking out for sure.  And by the time we left, the restaurant was full."}
{"text":"Japanese food is more than just sushi! 

Sakawa Cafe serves Japanese Style Western Food (y?shoku). and comfort food (ramen, rice bowl etc). Price are really reasonable with items priced under $10.

Warm and friendly service. The lady that working the front of the house is so cheerful and homey.

We ordered:
Katsu Don ($8.50) Pork Katsu and Egg on Rice
Japanese Style Doria ($8.50) Cream Sauce with Cheese on Ketchup Rice

There is an option for adding $1 to make it a combo with salad and soup Portion was just perfect and all prepared with care. 

They also serves espresso based and hand drip coffee using Social Coffee beans.

Sakawa Cafe is just amazing!

One of the most authentic Japanese Cafe in Toronto. So down to earth and without a sense of pretentious!"}
{"text":"This shop has been here since the summer but I never took the opportunity to try it. Shame on me! 

My friend and I wanted to try something new for breakfast and went here. I am so glad we did! The traditional Japanese breakfast with salmon was a perfect meal. Ours came with rice, miso soup, a green salad, a piece of grilled fish and two rotating side dishes (today were marinated wakame salad and marinated egg). It was really good, and would be great as  lunch, too. 

They do offer other more americanized breakfast options including egg plates and omelettes, but they have Japanese pancakes, which I've never seen before! They looked pretty different to the ones we are used to, but still really good. I wasnt in the mood for sweet, but next time I  I will try this! There's lunch and dinner options too, so I'll have to go back a few more times, yay!

The coffee was also really good. And they have aero press, if that's what you like! 

Please give this place a shot. The service was lovely and the food was near perfect."}
{"text":"Sakawa Cafe is definitely a hidden gem. 

It is a tiny authentic Japanese café on Danforth.  Overall, the service was excellent. Our lunches were delicious. The flavours are light years ahead of the cafes at J Town. 

My partner and I ordered Oyakodon (chicken egg rice) ($8.50), Japanese chicken curry ($8.5) and miso soup with salad (+$1) to share. Our friend had ramen with marinated ramen egg. All excellent! Our favourite was the hearty curry on Japanese rice. The rice was soaked in moist curry chicken with scrumptious potato and vegetables. 

The reason for the 4 star rating is due to their disappointing desserts - green tea cheesecake and green tea ice cream sundae.  The pancake and the crepe in the sundae were dried and tough. The cheesecake was dense. I would not recommend either of these desserts if you are visiting Sakawa Cafe!

If you are looking for a low key, authentic Japanese meal, this is the place to be! Look forward to trying their green tea latte as I heard great things about it!"}
{"text":"Been to this place for dinner twice now and both times it was fantastic. I'm partial to the onigiri (rice triangle with salmon stuffed in) and then the miso ramen with an egg added. Service is quick and friendly. Not sure why this place tends to be quiet because it is truly excellent!"}
{"text":"To echo other reviewers, this place is a hidden gem. I've only had their ramen so far, but it's enough to keep me coming back. The service is attentive and quick and there are always tables available when we drop by. Definitely give it a try."}
