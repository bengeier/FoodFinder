{"text":"Nice spot looking over the lake from a lovely terrace...Excellent lobster roll served with a delicious spicy mushroom soup. Friendly service, reasonable price... Very happy! Warmly recommended..."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT salad on the patio here recently and my lunch mates reportedly had the best fish of their lives.  The setting is by far the best part of this place -- relaxed, casual, and tempting me to order a draft beer or 4 and spend the afternoon there.  Unfortunately we had to return to work, so we opted for a nice lunch + view and promised to come back if we found ourselves in the area again.  The service was friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive. Working in a place like that may force a more relaxed attitude from the staff, so I decided my lack of patience was a sign from the universe to just calm the F' down.  So, this place is good for that."}
{"text":"This is almost the worst restaurant I have ever experienced. My cocktail tasted like it was made on Bourbon Street. When my \"tenderloin\" arrived seriously overdone, not to mention tres petite, I decided it was also low-quality steak ($28) and asked for the short ribs instead. I really didn't know you could make short ribs dry, flavorless and inedible, but I could barely saw the meat into bites it was so tough. The service was laggardly too -- no water was brought, and it took the waiter 20 minutes to notice that I wasn't eating. My companion suffered much more stoically  through his pasta, which looked better than what I was having but which he later disclosed was awful. I hate when restaurants think their responsibility begins and ends with a nice view."}
{"text":"Had such a beautiful night here. Sat outside and watched the sun set over the lake. And not to mention, the food was great! Started with the stuffed peppers and a house salad. The stuffed peppers had a super tasty Italian sausage they were stuffed with and had a great marinara sauce on the bottom. We got three huge peppers with our order so it was very reasonably priced. We also ordered the grilled salmon and the beer battered walleye. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. We also had great service and was just a enjoyable experience overall. Already looking forward to having another night here!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The staff was a little bit more frazzled than I thought they should be for a restaurant that wasn't too terribly busy, but we got over that quickly. The waitress was very nice, if slow at times. The food was amazing, though. I ordered the chicken parm and my husband ordered the pasta bayou. Both were delish!"}
{"text":"I was visiting the area on business and Jackalope came highly recommended. I was hoping for a view of the water but nothing was available. I was dining alone but received what I consider to be very poor service. The table was dirty (glass stuck to the table). Lobster bisque had good flavor but was gloopy and barely warm. The scallops were the bright spot in an otherwise complete disappointment. I waited 10 minutes for the waitress to take my credit card; finally the hostess saw me looking around a grabbed it for me. This was a Monday night so the restaurant was not even half full. I rarely eat at chains when I travel so I can get some local flavor, but if this is the best Lorain has to offer I'll stick to the Elyria mall area next time I visit Lorain."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE....owner is such an asshole...my aunt was unhappy with her meal and instead of apologizing and asking her if he could get her something different he proceeds to yell at her husband telling them is was fine and they shouldn't be complaining...made a huge scene and embarrassed himself in front of a restaurant full of people....absolutely no customer service from the owner....then I over heard him complaining to other people about us....NEVER WILL EAT HERE AGAIN and he told our large party of 20 that it was fine and didn't need our business"}
{"text":"We had a great time and was able to watch a great sunset over the lake.."}
{"text":"Spent a beautiful Saturday evening At the jack.  Enjoyed a great meal and a great view of the sunset from the patio.  Service was great at the bar and for our meal.  Enjoyed a great seafood pasta, cup of lobster bisque and a seasonal beer."}
{"text":"the best restaurant that lorain has....excellent!! service was great and the food....all should try it...."}
{"text":"As busy as they are....the staff did great!!!! I understand they have gone through a lot of new changes this summer.... That being said we were very impressed.... The view is outstanding, the food was comforting, and very tasty , our server was very friendly.... Host and manager were on top of everything.... This is our favorite place..... We felt very welcomed and comfortable...."}
{"text":"Service and menu options are mediocre.  View is excellent.  Nice place for a leak surely al fresco meal."}
{"text":"We held a family reunion in the private room on the 3rd floor. The room was wheelchair accessible and comfortably held our 40 guests. We fully utilized the outdoor patio that overlooks the lake, marina, and lighthouse. The food was wonderful - everyone particularly enjoyed the prime rib and redskin potatoes. Service was great. The private room was casual but nice. (I think the restaurant and bar below are even more casual, but we really didn't check it out.) Everyone left very happy, and we all agreed we'd hold a dinner here again. Thanks for helping us have a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious I just wish there was not so many bees outside so we could of stayed out on the patio other than that was perfect"}
{"text":"Well... It was cool, the place looked decent, but the view was amazing so why not. We got in and got seated right away on their patio. The view was like I said amazing! The problem was and why they get a 1 star... This place wasn't really that busy but for some reason after we were seated we never got to experience anything else. We sat there baking in the sun for 12 minutes and decided well, maybe they forgot about us. I feel like this could have been a cool place to eat but I never got to experience any food while I was there. Had I known, maybe I would have went to a pier, I'm sure they would have had at least some water waiting for me... Pathetic, I hope someone takes over this place that knows a thing or two about anything."}
{"text":"Came in on a dreary Sunday afternoon. Sat on the patio which was nice. Sever wasted no time in bringing is drinks and taking our order.   Patio has a couple of garage doors they can bring down when the weather turns crummy. Even though the space has never been used for vehicles (it's on the second floor), one of the doors has a hole cut into the bottom of it for a tail pipe vent. I thought that was funny!  No TVs on the patio, but a descent sound system playing some non-offensive tunes.   Started with the spinach artichoke dip. Came to the table in a crock with a layer of cheese on top, like a French Onion soup. The cheese was still bubbling and the dip was loaded with cream cheese too.  It was outstanding.  Had the chicken siracha soup...was in a heavy cream more like a bisque, and it was delicious.   Had the lake perch dinner as the entree. 5 pieces of perch, nicely breaded and fried crisp. Again, outstanding. The fries were good, but nothing to write about as was the coleslaw (I think it was Grandmas slaw from Giant Eagle).   They seemed a bit busy for the staff they had, but I wouldn't call it slow. Just not fast. I will come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty, good size portions. Prices are too high for the area. During my second visit, they were out of the martini I wanted, calamari and one margarita, so it was very disappointing, which was the only reason I came back for. Service was great. The patio needs a little updating."}
{"text":"I called and made a reservation for Mother's Day about 2 weeks prior to the date.  When we showed up at the restaurant, they were not serving off of the regular menu, but instead had a buffet brunch set up for $21.99 a piece.  In our party of 5, there was a person who had bariatric surgery and a vegetarian. I asked our waitress if we could order off of the menu, and she said, \"No, not today. Didn't they tell you when you made your reservation?\"  I said no.  She said, \"Well, let me know if you don't want to stay.\"  So because we were not familiar with the area and others in our party were hungry, we decided to stay.  There were no vegetarian options and the food was of very poor quality.  $21.99 was a very steep price for the food options they had.  Our hostest was less than attentive.  We had to ask for silverware twice, then ended up getting up to get it ourselves.  Plates piled up on our table for a while before she cleared them.  Then to top it all off, they automaticaly added an 18% tip to the bill.  We were not told this was their policy, and felt that it was out of line.  Expecially due to the quality of food, quality of service and the fact that it was a buffet and there were oly 5 of us.  All in all, our bill was over $130 for 5 of us to not eat.  We paid and left.  No one asked us how our food was or questioned why we were not eating or why we were leaving so soon.  I will never be back to this establishment.  It completely ruined Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Food is good for lunch. The Clam strips were tasty but too few for the price. Walleye tacos were good an so was the Buffalope. The mixed veggies as a side though were DELICIOUS! Perfect combo."}
{"text":"PleasePlease Please- to the owners. CLEAN THIS PLACE UP. It wouldn't take more than 500$$. The food is good, the view is beautiful, but the place is a dump. Dirty menus, unnecessary dirty bussing stand outside in full view, dripping downspouts stained wall. So move the bussing stand or paint the wall so it will blend in. Paint the one wall to match the drips. Clean the outside tables so there is not food stuck in the holes. Clean up the \"storage area\" on the back terrace. Wipe off the railings so there is not cobwebs with lots of bugs stuck in them- it takes a minute. Wipe down the doors if not paint them to refresh. YUCK"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE....... Service was terrible, our orders were mixed up. My wife didn't get her side. My son's pizza was almost unchewable, the crust was so hard you couldn't even push a knife through it. My lobster roll was so dry every bite i had to take a drink. Just a really bad for experience."}
{"text":"I have gone to this establishment a number of times, and have never really had an exceptional experience in regards to the food, drinks or the service at any time. It has seemed to have gone even further downhill recently. Last week I went again because it's close and to see if there was anything new. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes to have our drink order taken. We were there for a few hours, and it wasn't even busy that night. I had ordered a veal dish, and it came soaking in a bowl of grease. I sent it back and the hostess/manager was visibly angry about it and insisted that it was because the butter they put on top - melted. I still was not okay with a dinner soaking in grease..... It was gross.  We ended up with crab legs and bread....  Aside from the food served, the ambiance needs a serious update. There is a pretty thick layer of dust all over the ceiling and walls, and it smells like something gross - moldy covered by a powerful cleanser. I will not be making my way back here anytime soon. Too bad- there are not enough lakeside spots this side of town!"}
{"text":"Food is average at best. Price a little high. Restaurant should be named \"Jackass\" after managers crappy attitude toward customers.  I was part of a party of 14 and none of us will ever go back."}
{"text":"Average at best. Local regulars have priority for service and they don't really spend much and tip even worse. So that's that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great bartender he knows how to make good drinks!"}
{"text":"One of the lady's favorites!    Service is always friendly and attentive with a delicious menu to boot.  Her favorite is the lobster bisque... a staple each time we go."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque should be called a heavy cream soup with a lite essence of lobster"}
{"text":"The view here is great! The appetizers, great. Drinks, good. Regular menu, . You can't go wrong with happy hour at the bar area. The skins, quesadilla, etc are delicious and cheap. However, everything I have had entree wise has been subpar. I tried the pretzel crusted walleye, inedible. Chicken Caesar salad, not bad. Chicken salad on a croissant, best of all entrees I have tried, but still not great. It's worth trying for yourself and maybe you will have better luck!"}
{"text":"The food was just average. I was expecting better. I got the prime rib and it was way over cooked and did not have much favor. Was disappointed with my dinning experience."}
{"text":"We went to Jackalope for our 6th year wedding anniversary. The location is great since it's right by the lake. The restaurant is clean and spacious. The food was great!!! My hubby had the prime rib which was really good and I had the Atlantic salmon. Overall great atmosphere and staff. The food was delicious but i only gave it 4 stars because the portions were a little small for the price you pay. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"It sits on Lake Erie, co-located with one of the marina buildings in the area.  It's on the East side of Lorain, and being from here, I know it's not the best of neighborhoods, and it's declined in 30+ years.  But don't let that detract from visiting here.  Neighborhoods tend to decline when three major industries (steel, ship building, & auto manufacturing) pull out in about a 10-20 year span.  I've been here on a few occasions and am not dissapointed in the food, nor the views of the Lake especially during a sunset, it is magnificent.  Their customer service does waver depending on who is working, but all in all it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. On Friday and Saturday they have a great prime rib. The view is nice especially around sunset"}
{"text":"3 sitting areas, inside, patio and outside. Food is amazing!!!! The calimari is so yummy but the portions are small of it for the price, the dinner bread is mouth watering, lightly salted and garliced and melty butter. Mmmm! The soups are omg!!! Thick,creamy, ingredient filled. Now for the main courses make sure you read the menu, I messed up and what I got wasn't what I was expecting, but they will make it right.  Most definitely will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Prime rib medium rare was ice cold. Veggies ice cold. Waitress said she reheat it... So my 21 dollar meal will be taken home. What a waste."}
{"text":"0/10. Waited an hour for NO food. They gave us drinks but we ended up having to leave because the wait was too long. A lot of servers but no cooks it seems. Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"i was there the other night for dinner. it didn't  seem that busy yet the food took forever. who knows maybe it was just an off night in the kitchen. the friendliness of the wait-tress made up for it though. the food came out hot and just like we ordered.  the salmon was very good and the muscles were excellent.  'I'll be back'."}
{"text":"Avoid the long wait (up to 2 hours) by going to the bar and taking one's chances. The service is very friendly and the food first rate. This is a favorite place to stop while on the Ohio Turnpike and I turn in for the night."}
{"text":"Had the perch sandwich and it was perfectly cooked. Staff was friendly. And a great view of the lake."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll round up my rating from 3.5 to 4.  We went here for dinner on a winter Saturday night.  Service was good, attentive.  Menu had basic choices of pasta, seafood, and beef items.  Prime rib - which is a Friday and Saturday night special - was very well prepared.  The sides, were a little spotty, with the broccoli being overcooked.  The fried walleye was very good.  Portion size was appropriate for the price.  There is a nice selection of beer and wine. Overall, worth a return trip during the summer."}
{"text":"My now husband and I were in search of a restaurant that was on the water, served great food and had a good ambience to it for our rehearsal dinner.  The Jackalope was recommended to me by a coworker and boy can I tell you how grateful we were she did!    Before renting/reserving for our rehearsal dinner we decided to check it out on a Sunday evening for dinner.  We sat outside on the 2nd level out door seating area.  Our service was great and food was excellent...we were hooked!    Fast forward a bit, that Sunday night we had dinner we immediately booked it for our rehearsal dinner.  We reserved the 3rd floor private dinning room.  This is a great option for any private party need you may have.  I am unsure on the exact number it holds.  It has your own private balcony and private bar with bartender.  There is an elevator as well as stairs leading up to the 3rd floor.  All of our guests RAVED about how great the food was as well as the balcony.  Only thing I wish they would do or would suggest is to possibly have the \"openness\" on the 3rd floor as they do on the main outdoor seating area.    You would think living near a lake, a great lake at that, that there would be more on the water dining options, but there isn't.  The Jackalope is real gem and totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great food and location! Appetizers came out quick and the mixed drinks were amazing! Summer dream is the best! We called a few days ahead and made reservations requesting a table for 5+1highchair near the window lake view. When we got there they seated us right next to the hostess stand . The busiest traffic area of people trying to get through. The worst area for a baby in a high chair and the worst location away from any view. Was Not impressed with that at all. It was a very special occasion, we called ahead,put in a polite request and it didn't help at all. Made it stressful around the baby and felt we had the worst seat in the place. As if we got punished for making reservations and was thrown to the side. Our request was never considered. There were tables with better views open but obviously they didn't want us there. If it wasn't for that I would have rated 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"The lobster roll is the best I've ever had! Could use some bigger tvs. All their appetizers are great. Second best in Lorain. Sorry, Diso's takes that honor."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed dinner on the deck. The view of the lake, marina, and Lorain lighthouse were perfect. Our server was very friendly and took good care of us. We started with mussels for an appetizer and they were delicious!  They had a tomato, butter, & lemon base, which complimented the mussels very nicely. For dinner, we both had a 10 Oz. sirloin with a red wine reduction. The steak was cooked perfectly (med rare), was moist, and full of flavor.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp.  We also enjoyed the garlic mash potatoes.  Lorain should be proud to have Jackalope on its shoreline. :-)"}
{"text":"First visit, so far we have waited 40 minutes for 4 appetizers and its 2:30 in the afternoon and not busy. Our food is here,  but they forgot one appetizer....clams are rubbery.  Staff is not friendly or attentive.  Also the restaurant is not very clean. Although there is a beautiful view out the windows the windows are very dirty. Also there are dead bugs in the elevator, restroom and all over the building."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Jackalope for years now and always enjoy their Snow Crab Legs entree or Friday/Saturday night Prime Rib special. Best part of the Snow Crab Legs is the HOT butter they bring to your table-- it's in a little chafing dish with a lit candle underneath so the butter stays warm the entire time you're eating! GENIUS! Spinach artichoke dip appetizer is oh-so-cheesy! The garlic mashed potatoes are a great side for any entree and you have to at least take a look at their dessert tray after dinner!   Drinks are great-- love their margarita and they have a decent selection of beer and wines. Great for large or small groups-- I typically go with 8-10 people and have never had a problem with service, just make sure to call ahead for a reservation! Love the views of Lake Erie!"}
{"text":"It has been some time since I have been to this restaurant. All I can say is that I wish that they had the all you can eat Crab Legs night back! I would be there every week in a heartbeat if they had that again!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed that this place isn't what I was told it was.   We are new to the area and were so looking forward to a good restaurant with views.  We made reservations for Saturday night and good thing, because it was packed.   No seating available outside or with a view, so the dining room it was.  This restaurant is not staffed correctly.  The servers must have too many tables, as we waited for over 10 minutes before she stopped by just to say she would be by shortly to take our drink order.   \"Shortly\" was another 10 minutes.  We placed our food order at the same time since we had a bad feeling we would wait forever.  The Moscow Mules were terrible.   They weren't made correctly, and I have never had one served in a glass, they are always in copper mugs.  Two of the four of us had the lobster bisque soup.  Although full of flavor, it was only barely warm, which was too bad.   The bread is nice and warm and good.   Two had the salmon with baked potato and two had the prime rib.   Again, there is a warming issue as the baked potatoes were barely warm.  The salmon was very hot and the sauce was great, but when I got home, my body decided it didn't like it at all.   Those that had the prime rib said it was decent.  Sad to say, but we won't return.   The place feels dirty and the food isn't that great.  Super disappointed as with the views, this could be a gold mine."}
{"text":"Overlooking the marina, this is a great spot in Lorain County. I've never had a bad meal here. The pizza is perfect and perch sandwiches delish. The decor could be updated/cleaned up a bit, but you'll find yourself looking outside at the view over the water anyways..."}
{"text":"A nice place to watch the sunset while enjoying a casual environment with tasty food."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place! As far as restaurants in Lorain County goes The Jackalope is the top of the line! The best time of the year to go is definitely during late spring through early fall. You can enjoy the sunset over the marina and over Lake Erie while eating dinner or having a few drinks with friends. Have a boat? Take advantage of their public dock where you can park your boat and then come into the restaurant for a nice dinner.   If you go in the winter it is also nice. They have a great fireplace and dining room area that is very cozy.   The wait staff is always polite and helpful and the owner is usually around as well.   I have never had a meal that I didn't like at the Jackalope. My favorites are always their daily seafood specials. The dinner portion sizes are perfect, but they also have great salads, soups and desserts if you have a bug appetite. I do wish that their menu was a big more extensive, but what they do have is great!  The Jackalope can be a very classy and dressy place, but I would think nothing of walking in on a week night after leaving the gym in my sweats and a sweatshirt. Pretty much anything goes here as far as dress...especially in the summer.   If you are looking for a nicer, more upscale dinner in Lorain County or are looking for a nice romantic restaurant then I would give the Jackalope a try!!!"}
{"text":"Was going there for the first time on October 28, 2016 (at 12:30pm), and it was closed!  So call ahead, so you don't drive 40 minutes like I did. So we didn't actually get to tast"}
{"text":"I love eating here especially because of the lake views and the lighthouse.  Service is great and the people are always friendly.  They have a patio and the food is awesome as well as the drinks.  I love their dry rubbed wings; my favorite.  Their calamari is good too.  I haven't tried a whole lot of the menu but everything I have tried was great."}
{"text":"over-hyped and grossly over-priced. service was a joke and watching the drunken owner curse at random people was quite apalling. we left before our meal arrived.  DO NOT VISIT HERE. IT IS A JOKE"}
{"text":"It's a real disappointment to come to a place in such a prime location only to receive food that was sub par. The perch that did not taste at all like perch and all I can taste was the under seasoned breaking. The salmon wrapped we ordered was over cooked, all in all it was over priced and underwhelming.  Aside from the bad tasting food, they also have pretty awful service. My wife's seat had spilled sauce on it, which thankfully we notice before she sat down. When we pointed it out to the server all she did was move it to another table for the next unsuspecting patron.  So do yourself a favor and just avoid this place."}
{"text":"View was exceptional but the food was not as good as the prior reviews suggested.  We started with the humus and 1/2 order of Nachos for starters.  The humus was excellent, but the nachos left something to be desired even though this was one of their most popular dishes.  The choices were beef or pork.  The beef was o.k. but greasy.  The cheese was not good - very watery and not a Mexican queso type of cheese.  If they would offer chicken nachos and a better quality cheese, they would be excellent.  Next we ordered the perch.  There really wasn't much flavor other than the breading and tarter sauce.  Found out later that the perch and walleye were frozen and not fresh....something about they couldn't serve fresh fish because they were located right on Lake Erie.  Hard to believe you could be so close to the lake and not be able to serve fresh fish!  I would go back for the view, but the food was average in my opinion."}
{"text":"First visit after hearing many good things about the food.  This is a great summer spot - eat out on the deck overlooking the marina and Lake Erie.  Very nice view for a fun summer night.  Walking in to the place you may wonder if you are in the right place.  Have to take the elevator or stairway up to the restaurant and it isn't all the clean but once you get up the the actual restaurant it is nice.  Had the walleye dinner and it was very good.    Will be coming back during the summer for sure to try more of the menu.  Would recommend this place to anyone!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good coke no Pepsi seating outside is nice. Wait staff isn't bad they allow dogs on the patio"}
{"text":"The only great things to say about this restaurant are that the drink prices are very reasonable and that Jackalope was able to accommodate our party of six on a Saturday night, we did call for reservations. The food is OK but nothing memorable. The atmosphere is nice but tired. We were joking about the need to store garden equipment on the lovely deck overlooking Lake Erie.  No real attention to details.   Our server was incredibly slow and not to attentive.  After waiting for about 15 minutes to collect our bill we asked the busboy to find them for us.   Our family loves to bring us here when we visit but next time I think we'll look for another place."}
{"text":"Service was very good and the food and appetizers were spaced out perfectly and the food was absolutely great!!! Definitely will be back and perfect view of the sunset on the lake!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for 45 minute wait for our food. Made a reservation. Got seated right away. Good service by the waitress. But waiting for the food? We sat outside. Great view of the water. Food was very good--prime rib and baked potato.  Yellow perch was lightly fried with a side of nice tarter sauce. Grilled veggies and risotto were nice. All four of us liked our meals. We were not offered dessert, but we were ready to leave, so okay. We did not experience the dining room. Bathrooms were clean.  Has a lovely gift shop. This is one of the few restaurants on the water of Lake Erie. Recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner on June 2.  She had the prime rib (as rare as possible) and I had the Halibut and Scallop Special.  Both were excellent!!  Also, our server, Alison, was terrific.  We found her easy to talk to and was very helpful when we had questions.  The first drink I ordered was one of their signature cocktails.  It was way too sweet for me.  Allison came back to see how we liked our drinks and when I told her that I didn't really like it - she offered to get me another cocktail - no charge,  We like Alison a lot!  I gave 5 stars for the food.  If I could, I would give one star for getting to the building.  I can't walk that well and I use a cane.  I found the curb at the entrance to be pretty high and nowhere did there seem to be an easy way to get from the parking lot to the sidewalk to get to the entrance.  My wife had to help me onto the sidewalk.  It would have been nice if the curb at the entrance to the building could have been modified so that people who have trouble getting around could get into the building easier!  All in all we enjoyed our time at Jackalope and we will come back again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to the Jackalope for a while so we decided stop for dinner.  We were not disappointed.  The food was extremely good.  After being seated we placed our drink orders and they were brought to the table very quickly considering how busy they were.  My wife ordered sausage stuffed peppers as an appetizer and I ordered the Ahi tuna.  The peppers were superb and the Ahi was outstanding.  For dinner my wife ordered Shrimp Jackalope and I had prime rib.  Both entrees came out very quickly and were very good.  My prime rib was cooked perfectly, very tender and flavorful.  My wife's pasta was excellent and contained an abundance of shrimp.  Our server was very professional as well as attentive and did an outstanding job.  All in all the Jackalope provides great food, good service at a reasonable price.  It is a great place for dinner and I would recommend giving it a try if you already haven't."}
{"text":"We were in the Oberlin/Cleveland area looking for a new spot to eat, and found this place on Lake Erie. We had checked the website before going and thought it looked like an elegant restaurant, with seating outside on the water. The photos of the food and views looked amazing, so we decided to give it a try. (Fancy seafood, served on white linens, with boats docked on the water...just beautiful!)  However, when we got there, after driving through a not-so-attractive neighborhood, we were highly disappointed. Yes, the sunset was gorgeous...but it was almost instantly forgotten when we stepped inside a dirty vestibule. The only way into the restaurant was by entering a stairwell (think smelly fire escape). The actual restaurant was no better. It was not the classy place represented on the website at all! Instead, it was patrons wearing t-shirts and shorts, sticky tables, and tacky, plastic decorations. There were \"jackalopes\" in photos, stuffed animals, etc. everywhere! (What are they anyway? --We never found out.)  It didn't get better when the food arrived. The prime rib was dry and poorly prepared. The mussels were smaller than a penny, and the chicken parmigiana was tough. We will never return. Please, think twice before trying it."}
{"text":"A group of ten of us went to celebrate a retirement last week. First off, I would like to say that all the staff we encountered throughout the night were probably some of the friendliest folks I've come across at a restaurant.  Not only were they friendly but efficient with the orders and were great about separate checks.   We requested the patio and the view was spectacular.  We were there for the sunset which was awesome.   The food was good, but not great. I ordered the lobster roll which came with a side for only $10. A great deal, but again, it wasn't the best I have ever had nor the worst.   Would I return?  Absolutely, for the view alone; and the friendly staff, but if I had to judge on food, I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! We visit on Mondays for the Mussels special - 4 dozen for 10.95! Can't beat that! They are delicious, served in a bucket with wine butter broth. We like to sit out on the patio and watch the sunset while we eat. We somehow by luck end up with the same server every time, and she is friendly, attentive without overdoing it, and relatively quick. The hummus is also yummy, served with warm toasty pita and fresh veggies."}
