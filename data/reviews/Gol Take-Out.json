{"text":"Not impressed. Food was ok, but very overpriced for what it is. Got the rice and chicken with eggplant, but for $10 + tax I got a lot of rice, some eggplant, and only 4 tiny pieces of chicken! Place was dark and dingy, looked like it was about to shut down. Tons of better options in the area IMO."}
{"text":"I need to update my review since this Resturant has been sold and is under new Managment. The new staff and owners are not Iranian and have altered the Persian cuisine. The food has an Afghani style feel to it and is incomparable to the previous ownership. I don't want Jalape√±o with my Persian Sultsn food nor do I need hot sauce. I want parsley n onions with butter on the side. Btw the price has increased quite a bit. My Sultani meal use to cost $16 and is now $20. I am partial now and never actually enjoyed Afghan Food or Hot peppers with my classic Persian Cuisine. There is no justification for the price increase. I didn't see a lineup as I once did in the past and the open sign was off!  No music inside or anything to help set the mood."}
{"text":"Decent place near Sheppard station when in the mood for some Persian food takeouts. Kebab platter portion is quite big, generous amount of rice and meat. lightly seasoned, not charred and greasy, healthy eating."}
{"text":"Nice little mom-and-pop Persian shop. Great for takeout. The meat is freshly grilled and is very tasty. As with my prior Persian experiences, it is served with an inhumane amount of rice. Not much in the way of salad or veggies though."}
{"text":"I don't know why but the quality and service at this place seemed to have went down the last few months. Due to the convenience of location I frequented this place from time to time but now it's not even possible to call in to place an order to get take out since they don't bother to answer their phones. I would have thought that a place with take out in their business name would accept calls for take out. I'm not sure if they keep regular business hours since they seem to be randomly opened or closed when I talk by regardless of their posted hours.

Price creeped up quite a bit as well with no noticeable increase to quality or even quantity, which is always a disappointment. You get that feeling that the business has no real interest in your business so you start to think of alternatives. Maybe they prefer to work on high quantity catering instead of individual customers since the last few times I visited they were typically busy preparing for large orders."}
{"text":"This place is an Iranian take out. We take out food from here almost every week. They cook very good Iranian food and their price list is decent. My favourites are Koobideh, Kashk-e-Bademjan and Ash-e-Reshte.
We have also ordered our party food from this place and they have been good caterers."}
{"text":"Best Iranian Kebabs in Toronto. Very kind staff. I recommend their Koobideb and Jooje! Try it!"}
{"text":"We ordered Kobide and Joje from here. Kobide was out of this world, the best Kobideh I have ever had. Joje was awesome as well. The price is fair and the food is super-delicsiouse and fresh. I recommend it 100%."}
{"text":"Gol (Flower in Farsi) is not a fancy bouquet. It is however the perfect spot to stop by before home for some take out or even squeeze into one of only four chairs over a counter to quickly have a meal. The menu items are posted and each great, but the key here is to look for specials dnd unique dishes only made on certain days and in limited amount. Ask for them as owners are extra friendly and willing to help out. I wish I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Here is the best place you can find persian food. The taste is like home made food. Especially when you are far away from home it reminds you Mom's food. Don't miss here if you are near."}
{"text":"Pros:
Friendly service
Good portions

Cons:
Prices are a tad higher than other Persian restaurants

Gol is my go to when my GF and I are feeling like Persian food.  It's close by to where I am and it's pretty good. I've been there a couple of times and each and every time it's been a pleasant experience.  Note that this place is basically take out only.  There are 3 or 4 chairs and a small counter, but's it made for a take out experience.

Gol is run by what I believe to be a married couple.  I've only had interaction with the lady when I come here.  She is very nice and always greets me with a smile.  There is a slight English barrier but she makes every effort to make sure things are OK.  She's a good reason why I keep coming back.  She once gave me a discount on a meal because she said the portion is smaller than normal. I wasn't even a normal customer then when she did that.  Simply great!!

On to the food.  Our go to order here is a beef koobideh and lamb shank.  Like all Persian restaurants, the koobideh is made to order.  The lamb shank is one of the biggest portions I've ever gotten at a Persian restaurant. Both are made very well and taste great.  They also give you a lot of rice to go with your meal.  For a big eater like me, that's a big plus.  Every meal here comes with a pop as well.

The prices here are a tad higher than other places.  If there's any negative here that would be it.  However, if you factor in the pop and that taxes are included with the price, it's not that significant.  The service you get here puts it over the top for me.

If you're in the area and feeling Persian, give Gol a try.  It's a nice little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Such value for such amazing food. We got the combo where it came with grilled veggies, kabob meat, chicken, lots of rice, and 2 drinks. The meat is the juiciest, most tender meat I've ever had besides the 3 digit $ steaks!! If you don't finish it in one go, microwaving it the next day still tastes amazing.

Be careful, the jalenpenos are VERY hot."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! 

One of the best and lucky to have this walking distance from the office. Price is fair for the portion of food (but typical of all Persian portions...huge!). 

Meats are grilled perfectly and service always friendly. Guaranteed to cause a food coma...so don't eat this on a busy work day!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and when I'm craving some kebabs, this is my place to go!

The price is economical, the portions are big and the flavours are great. I've had their koobideh 3x so far, and every time it's juicy and flavourful. The char taste is great!

The service I've had so far were normal and they were friendly. A nice family owned shop!"}
{"text":"Definitely great food. Many of the events i go to, do their catering with Gol!  My only objection? They close early.. But oh well, considering its a family joint restaurant, cant sacrifice quality with putting in workers. Azadeh (the owner) is a LOVELY lady btw.. Im not too sure what the other person is talking about..."}
{"text":"My friend was having a new years party at his condo and order food for take out at the restaurant. I went with him to pick it up and I must say this is definitely a little gem in the city. When we first arrived there the lady behind the counter acted as if she didn't know what order we were talking about. After a few minutes my friend and I realized she was kidding.. 

My friend ordered Chicken Kababs and Beef Kababs. This was the first time I was going to eat Persian food and I was super excited. The reason I was so excited to try this cuisine was because it  smelt so wonderful.. My friend also ordered rice for 10 which came in a tray big enough to probably feed 30. Very generous with their portion sizes. The lady serving the food was very chatty and didn't make us feel at all unwelcome. She even tried to get to know us on a personal note asking us where we were from then complementing myself on my beauty. 

Now on to the food.. I could not get over how much full of flavour and juicy it was. I will be moving to this area at the end of the month and I can totally see myself become a regular here."}
{"text":"I'm new to Persian food...  Came into this little takeout joint.  Got the koobideh.  They roasted the meat, a whole tomato, and a jalapeno over some coal till it got some nice charring.  Came with a ton of rice and a salad... and a hot sauce which was pretty mild and more like a salsa.

The flavour was not for me.  A little bland for my taste.  Not a fan of the seasoning as well..  But the lady behind the glass was nice, and the portions were huge...  Interesting enough, I took a lot of leftovers home, and my kids gobbled it up.  Bet they would have given a better review."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean home-cooking flavour (not greasy at all). Got to get the lamb shank with vegetable rice, which comes with a huge lamb bone with tender meat."}
