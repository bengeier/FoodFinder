{"text":"I absolutely hate going to the mall but I will make a special trip and go out of my way to eat at Fresh to Order at Carolina Place. The menu is not large but absolutely everything on it is wonderful, and as others have said you really need to try the various flavored teas and lemonades. Small plates are a great choice if you'd like to not eat too much. My wife and I will often each get a small plate plus a third small plate to share.  We even get takeout from here!"}
{"text":"Great, healthy, fresh food! I've eaten here twice in the last week! Had the best grilled veggie sandwich the first time. So much flavor - the best I've had. Last night I tried the coconut curry salmon and it was just as delicious. Love that you can order appetizer, 3/4 or full portions of several items. Great, warm service. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Food here is always good, prepared fast and great customer service. So far I've had several dishes from the menu and I'm impressed every time"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Since I work in the mall it is nice to have a new place to eat that is not fast food. I feel sorry for the others in the food court because this place should steal away some business.  The hardest part is finding it.  Be sure to go to the second floor and walk past the dipping dots stand. Everything I had was good and the infused drink station is the best. Mango lemonade is delicious.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the seared tuna with the mustard sauce.  To me the mustard sauce doesn't go well.  I told the manager this and he brought out an order of plain tuna and it was great.  You can also get ginger sauce just be sure to specify when you order.  Great place and my coworkers and I go here at least once per week."}
{"text":"I loved loved loved it! So many of my friends have been raving about this place and now I know why! They have so many different things to choose from. They have anything from salads and soups to coconut curry chicken.   I got the appetizer version of the coconut curry chicken and it was so good! I was honestly full just from that so their full size must be huge! Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"We were in an area where we needed YELP to find us a restaurant and we're very happy to find Fresh Two Go.  The food was wonderful and the atmosphere didn't feel like fast food places.  Drink choice were excellent.  Wish we had one need our home.  We will definitely repeat our visit whenever we are in Pineville or South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best healthy option Pineville has going. I thought this place would be lower quality being in the mall but the protein quality is great. I love the bison burger and coconut curry chicken. The fusion water is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I hope it stays around!  The fire grill makes a huge difference in flavor. I ordered the coconut curry chicken which is two chicken breasts smothered, a nice red onion and corn relish, a garnish salad that was more than a garnish, & I substituted the wheat berry rice for grilled veggies. Beautiful chat on the veggies, the half corn cob was salty good, the broccoli, portobello, & red pepper was big and tasty.  I added a baby green salad with a apricot ginger dressing that was very good. Big pecans and raisins on it and the blue cheese crumbles were not bitter. I was so impressed with my meal. It ended up leaving me full as a tick!  There was also a mini croissant with honey? that also was very delicious. Very thankful for having eaten there.  And I haven't even mentioned the salads I took to go. Big and delicious looking with fire grilled chicken added. Very wholesome. But my favorite were the \"flavored waters\". Among them were tea, wild berry tea?, orange mango lemonade, cucumber water, & my favorite: vanilla anise? mint lemonade.  So good. Well worth buying a cup which provides free self-serve refills for dining-in.  Very friendly & helpful service and great fire grill cooks which I encountered will help make this place a star.  Well-done!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new, what appeared to be nicer, place to eat in the mall.  I will NEVER go back.  First of all, they charge you $10 for half of what a similar restaurant would serve you and \"kettle chips\" are actually the little kids lunchbox size regular Lays potato chips.  I was still willing to try the food until I opened up my sandwich and the turkey was black with mold.  Please don't go here.  They are overpriced and clearly their food quality is lacking."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise at the mall.   Much better than I expected.  Worth going out of your way to stop by."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!! It was brought out fast, fresh and hot..It was so refreshing to walk into the mall and find a place with so many healthy options. The staff was friendly and the place was very clean..I have been back 4 additonal times already in 2 weeks. I pray that this place survives in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"The almond crusted chicken skewers with a side of wheat berry and a fruit salad is the perfect meal. Everything is really good but that is my usual order. It tastes amazing and you don't have to feel guilty about giving into greasy mall food. Also love the drink selections. They make a lot of fruit teas and lemonade and infused waters that are really yummy. Everything is super fresh and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty dishes along very friendly staff, what else could you ask for?! Cleanliness? Check! This place is awesome, and the prices? They are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"The flames licking directly behind the ordering counter were very promising for a meal full of freshness and flavor. While this place is probably better than most food court places, the food is not, actually, fresh to order. It's 'cook hours before they open, hold it and serve it later.' My two experiences have been this:  First visit, ordered the veg panini. Expected the veggies to be freshly grilled, nice and warm between two pieces of warm bread. After all, a panini is served warm with melty cheese. Not so here. The veggies were cold and limp, the bread was room temp. I walked up to the counter and asked why, and they told me they grilled the veggies 3 hrs ago and had been keeping them in the fridge. Hm. So my order was NOT, actually, fresh to order.  Second visit, I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar panini. This time I asked in advance how they prepared it, and they told me they grill the chicken (on a flat grill, not charcoal) hours in advance then put it in a \"holding pot\" to keep it warm until ready for use. Hm. So my order was NOT, actually, fresh to order.  That being said, the tomato bisque and mushroom soups were absolutely heavenly. These soups will be the only reason I ever go back again, and I will order them to go. If you're going to cook in advance of opening the restaurant, hold for long periods of time and serve later, then you'll need to change your name. Really."}
{"text":"My meal was fine. Certainly not five stars though. The menu choices are very appealing. I had a tough time making up my mind. I chose the Asian panini with a house salad - from the 1/2 and 1/2 choice. With a drink my total was just over $11. Portion sizes were smaller than expected. Fine for me, but might be too small for a big appetite.   The salad was a total disappointment. The lettuce was iceberg and looked straight out of the bag. There were three small cucumber slices, some cheddar cheese and a few raisins.   The panini was okay, but did not live up to the description. Really just tasted like a fried chicken tender on bread.   Versus Panera - I would choose Panera hands down based upon this one meal. For the money I can choose and much more creative salad (with meat) and a better sandwich at Panera.   With that said, I did see some other menu items being delivered that *looked* tasty. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Need a change from the fast food places? This is it. Good food fast and affordable. Staff is very friendly and fast. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, definitely offers the best and healthy and fresh cooked options in an area you typically wouldn't expect. I highly suggest any of their chicken dishes and they have several different types of black tea which is great as well"}
{"text":"It was fresh to go! Found this little gem on Yelp while in town for work. The crispy ale chicken is pretty awesome! I also got the seared tuna and a side salad to get an idea of what they offer. I found both to be very good. If you like fresh fast food that is a good option try this spot out!"}
{"text":"So good! Everything was very fresh and tasty.  Shared small plates with sides and am stuffed.  Not the kind of place I would have expected to find at the mall.  Even the lemonades are great."}
{"text":"Ooh my word, I can not express how refreshing it is to have such an amazing and healthy option in Carolina Place Mall. I am not a fan of this mall however with a teenager who LOVES this place my hubby and I end up here bored and hungry and sometime resort to having to eat CRAP in the food court. Of course you have Harpers there however it's more stuffy than Fresh To Order and easily forgetable as well.  Now lets get started, from the moment you enter into this restaurant whether you enter from outside or from the mall the staff is extremely welcoming. They immediately acknowledge your presence and offer you a menu to review (hand held).   The open FIRE is Beautiful and an attention grabber as well as the Tea and Lemonade bar where they have everything from Mint Lemonade to Strawberry Lemonade and various fresh brewed tea flavors.  The FOOD is FRESH I guess that is why the name of this place is Fresh To Order. I had the Salmon Panini it was Bourbon marinated salmon, avocado, lettuce, tarragon aioli, corn cilantro relish on Cibatta with a side of green apples. My husband had the tomato and mozzarella panini with chicken and a side of house made chips. WE both cleaned our plates it was sooooo GOOD.   Soo Good I say, I went back the next day to pick up dinner. This time I had the Asian Salad with Salmon and my husband had the Waldorf Chicken Panini. Can you say TWICE as NICE .. TWO times the CHARM.. Satisfaction AGAIN.  The restaurant is clean, welcoming, comfortable and very inviting. Even the GM was walking around sweeping and wiping tables while checking on customers he was very nice as well (His name is Tim) and readily available to discuss the concept and future plans for the franchise in NC.'  The ONLY reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is located at my least favorite mall. If it was at Southpark mall I'd give 5 stars :-)"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. We had Saturday lunch. I was very impressed with the quality of the food. I had the soup with 'real' pieces of chicken in it followed by a black bean burger. Fabulous! The fruit and mint infused water is delicious.  It looks like a fast food chain restaurant inside , food is worth it. Staff very helpful."}
{"text":"My mom's food senses were tingling while driving by at the mall. We stopped in to see the menu and was surprised by what F2O has to offer! My mom got the Southwest Salad and added the Crusted Chicken Skewers to it. Since I was wanting something small and light to eat, I got the kids Coconut Curry Chicken with Garlic Mashed potatoes (normally comes with Sweet Mashed Potatoes). The mashed potatoes are pureed, which were still delish. It came with a small salad with a vinaigrette. The chicken breast was a great portion for a kids dish. I was surprised at how yummy this place is. Mom and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a while, so I was looking forward to stopping in. And doing some shopping at Carolina Place mall gave me the perfect opportunity. Normally, I have the time to check out the menu before to at least have an idea of what I'm going to order but I didn't have the opportunity too before this visit.   So yes, I was the one person in line reading the menu telling others to \"go ahead, I can't decide what I want to try\"....sorry!   When I got up to the counter I was still confused but the man that helped me out was very friendly. He asked if it was my first time...Yes and how I'd heard about them....YELP (of course) and ran down some suggestions. I saw on the menu board that the current special was the wedge salad and soup of the day was corn chowder.   Perfect.   I grabbed a drink and the tea/lemonade bar is awesome! I chose the mango lemonade and found a booth. My food arrived shortly after and was prepared as I requested. The salad was good. Typical wedge with iceberg lettuce, blue cheese, bacon and dressing (no tomatoes for me, but they come standard). The soup was good too! It was a little sweet but there was a good balance of flavors and the mini croissant was divine. A really nice touch.   I'd definitely come back to this place and bring some friends...especially since the prices were so reasonable!"}
{"text":"Much better than typical food court/fast food fare! You don't have to suffer through fried, tasteless junk food at Carolina Place Mall. The atmosphere is nice, modern and clean. Fancy but not  pretentious! There is a wide variety of tasty soups, salads, sandwiches and entrees. Large portions and great presentation. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't believe a fast food place inside a mall is this good! I ordered a side house salad and the grilled salmon entree - yummy!! Even the presentation is beautiful. I would expect to pay at least $20 for this meal in a \"sit-down\" restaurant and for only $12, this is a great bargain!  A shout out to Jamal, one of the employees. He rang me up but also delivered my food to the table. He gave me great suggestions and was very careful with confirming that there wasn't soy in the dish I ordered once I mentioned my allergy.  I will so be back here and tell all my friends about it!"}
{"text":"Definitely a step above typical mall food :) Located on the upper level across from digital photo place ( Jcp side) Only been open close to 3 weeks and we were greeted nicely. Place is clean and has warm decor. You order and they give you a number for your table or you can do take-out. Food options include paninis and salads, but also have full entrees like coconut curry chicken. Th food presentation is nice-skinny rectangular plates- even down to the kids meals. Kids meals are only $4 , include a drink and is a  huge portion There are regular fountain drinks, plus beverages like raspberry mojito lemonade&green apple cinnamon unsweet tea. No upcharge! ;) Universal servers checked on us and were pleasant. Overall prices are above fast food combos, yet reasonable. The staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable of menu and we will be back."}
{"text":"GO HERE NOW !! I think the location kept me away but it won't any longer.  Food was great.  Lots of healthy selections.  The mushroom soup was delicious. Grilled vegetable pannini was tasty.  There was so much more that I want to try.   My only complaint was the staff's lack of knowledge on the menu  and ordering options.  It seems like better training is needed.  Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing for a meal on the run. I picked up dinner on a cold, rainy evening when stranded in Pineville while my son had his soccer practice. Ordering online was so convenient, and when we got home and had a hot, delicious and nutritious meal to dig into it was heaven. Our faves from our order were the seared tuna over Asian slaw and the grilled chicken in a mushroom sauce with a side of garlic mashed.  Yum!  Despite the weird name of this place- and the bright, fast-food vibe to the decor and lighting- they turn out a real meal. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. Excellent quality and large quantity. I had fig salad with shrimp and corn chowder. They seem fresh and chef prepared. Corn chowder has some heat, but Delish. Should be a 4.5 star place. Go!"}
{"text":"Freshest food in Charlotte! Asian salad with tuna and then the spinach salad with steak both had an outstanding mix of ingredients didn't even need dressing.  Everything was so yummy even the flavored spa water. We will definitely add this restaurant to our weekly rotation!"}
{"text":"I always order the \"Smokey Southwest Chicken\" with side veges.   My kids get the Crisp Chicken Tenderloins w/ mac & cheese. Their portions are big and awesome, even for a kids sized meal. The lemon, mint, cucumber water is the bomb.com! Service is excellent! I always come to this restaurant. There needs to be more signage so people know that it's there."}
{"text":"So many of Facebook friends were posting about this place that I had to make an effort to come over and try it. It was one of the best food choices I made all week. The service was A+ too.   I have to come back to tell you all my favs but if you like mushrooms then I recommend the chicken/steak with the mushroom cream sauce. It's decadent, fresh and affordable. I picked the small plate so I could try something else too. Well when I checked in on Yelp I got a free side salad or soup...SCORE!   This place is the best thing that has happened to Carolina Place Mall in a long time!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's fine dining in less than 10 minutes. The menu is full of creative dishes. I work in the mall and eat here twice a week. My coworkers and I agree that you can never get bored of this place. Great service. I recommend them to everyone. I even go here to eat dinner. Beats any restaurant/food place in or surrounding the mall. VERY healthy too!"}
{"text":"Very true to the name \"Fresh to order\". The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly, welcoming and pleasant. The costumer service truly puts a cherry on top."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after getting it of work early. I ordered the ahi tuna small plate and a side of mushroom soup. Can't believe I forgot to take a picture because it was beautifully presented. The tuna was awesome - the only surprise to me was that it had honey mustard dressing on it. it didn't seem to pair right. The mushroom soup is always perfect, a must have for me whenever I come here. The service is great and pretty quick if you work in the area and are looking for some place for lunch.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you want a salad because they may not have it. Ordered Mac and cheese for my daughter told they didn't have it after I paid. Apparently they didn't have grilled chicken either. It was awful! Ordered the bison burger medium it was well done and burnt. My mom order grilled chicken ended up with fried chicken tenders that were inedible. Overall not impressed won't be back and it's sad because the ratings say it's good but the farthest thing from the truth."}
{"text":"I was there on Friday 10/2 and as usual the food was delicious. The chicken soup was awesome as was the lentil. I ordered a red velvet cupcake and it was divine."}
{"text":"Very good food with lots of choices!  But my favorite thing has to be the iced tea selection.  I will not return to a restaurant that doesn't have good tea.  This place has an iced tea bar! Different flavors!  It is wonderful.  Makes me wish they offered larger cups....but I get it. Will return many times"}
{"text":"This was a very surprising restaurant, I loved that there are no french fries, you can get grilled veggies, a large fruit cup or a number of other healthy sides.  The food was very good and the manager on duty was helpful answeing questions, definitely a franchise I would be keeping an eye on as they grow into other states."}
{"text":"Very good addition to Carolina Place, and different from what you find in the food court.   The steak panini is great, steak was cooked just right.   Only suggestion would be better chip options. With such a great panini having Lays seemed subpar but certainly not a big deal."}
{"text":"It's American style.  They provide a discount to Mall Employee's. Show ID Open fire and grill in the restaurant.  Tea/Lemonade bar with spices and zest. (E.G. Cucumber mint water; peach something lemonade; star anise & something else in the other lemonade; 5 different flavor tea's; Izze & fountain drinks are available)  *cupcakes and minature slices of ice box pie.  B) Soup c) Salads d) Fruit as a side E) Salads F) Kids meals G) Punch card for visits and purchases H) Kids meals that are filling and the kid didn't complain I) Smart dressings for the salads and dips/sauces for apps J) Wheat berry rice is so nice.   I can attest to the Kid's Salmon meal which included a salad, carrot sticks (no one liked these because they were not cooked just lightly steamed or something); wheat berry rice; salmon seared and grilled plus the sauce was automatically served on the side without requesting it.   Pork Lion with Mashed Sweet potato app. Got it to go and forgot to take a picture but it is large enough for a real deal dinner when working a full shift.   Chicken tender/shrimp/ahi tuna app on a nice bed of salad with tasty dressing. I wish it had cilantro then the entire deal would have been perfect.   K) You can download the app to pay for your meal and earn money/rewards faster. HOWEVER, you can't order from the app. Then menu is available on the app for review but that's all.It's a QR code and you can include tip amounts."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that they do fresh food fast. Lots of flavor combinations and unique items to try. Salads are big and plentiful and service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Lets face it, the food court can get pretty boring. My coworkers and I often visit F2O during our lunch break. The Appetizers are nicely portioned for one person I totally recommend ordering the Chicken fingers, and or Calamari. I'm guilty of ordering Chicken fingers with a side of Mac & Cheese (this will fill you up). Another favorite of my pallet is the Blu Cheese Fig Salad...yassss, this salad completes my life..seriously! of course it's enough to feed two people, so it's well worth getting. Oh! The freshly made dispense beverages are so amazing, you may never have another fountain drink in your life! Personally I LOVE the Mint Lemonade....best ever. Anywho, I'll probably have lunch here tomorrow. This review is not over #Foodie"}
{"text":"I've been here MANY times. I use to live around the corner. I came in twice a week. There was an older gentleman that worked there knew us and greeted us warmly every time, he didn't appear to be there anymore. Used to love this place! I hadn't been in 5 months and was on this side of town. I was so excited to be able to eat lunch here... I was upset to see the health score had dropped to a 91.5?!? I ordered a salad with calamari and mushroom soup. Soup was good.  Calamari looked burnt but was actually spot on. Fryer oil probably needed a change. My salad on the other hand was anything but fresh. My Lettuce was so wilted it was like soup. The avocado slices on top were so soft and brown it looked like a glop of old guacamole and was completely inedible. It was like it was made yesterday and reused today... Just plain  nasty. The croissants used to be served hot and coated in honey. Mine was cold, like straight out of the refrigerator and no honey. Over all I was disappointed. I will not be going out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Great prices and wide variety of healthy options. Like a way better version of panera. Can't wait to go back and try more things. Got the Asian salad, which was delicious, and I am picky with salad. Also got the tomato bisque, which was the best tomato soup I have ever had. Definitely need to go"}
{"text":"I discovered this gem via YELP! Working in Pineville I am always researching for new places to eat lunch within our one hour time frame.  We've lost many a restaurant in Pineville over the years.  Situated away from the every day Food Court traffic, between the fashionable JCPenney and always entertaining Sears, there are plenty of parking places available.  On my first trip - nay every trip - the GM has been very welcoming and energetic about the F2O brand. He was very helpful explaining the menu and different options available.  I haven't received a bad meal either time. AND every meal comes with a (if you've seen my Tip) sweet delicious pillow-y croissant! Mmmm...  In my opinion, the prices can't be beat for FRESH, HEALTHY options -- and I've never walked away feeling hungry. But, also never felt miserable as other fast food places can make you feel. The portions are incredible for the price.  As far as beverages, they are plenty of choices available. Beer, your every day soda fountain, and a fantastic Tea Bar - with several tasty options - and a daily changing flavored water option! The latter is complimentary when ordering a \"free\" water! Fantastic!  It's FRESH!"}
{"text":"If you are going to cheat your diet... This is the place to do it and NOT feel bad.. Well, just stay away from the most desirable cupcakes and cookies. My carryout experience was fast, accurate, and most importantly INVITING!  My Bison burger was cooked perfectly.. The add ons were just the right touch for a flavorful bite. My Calamari was tender as well with a great sauce! Even at a cold temperature, my burger is still fabulous! (revisited my burger after having to take care of an office issue in the middle of my lunch)  Great job guys! Please continue to deliver excellence!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat when you have dietary restrictions or are looking for delicious healthy food! I had the tomato bisque soup, it was fresh and very tasty. They have a wide array of fresh teas and waters infused with fresh fruits and herbs! I also had the baby greens salad. It had pecans and blue cheese and it was delicious. Also, the coconut curry tofu was fantastic. The staff was very kind and when my food don't come out when my husbands did, they offered a free dessert."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant after seeing a friend post some pictures of the food from the location in Atlanta. We were thinking it was going to be just like a Panera Bread type restaurant but it is so much more!! The atmosphere is so inviting and the food is delicious. I had the grilled mushroom chicken and it was to die for! The owner came up to us and introduced himself and we felt right at home. We will definitely be adding this to our rotation of favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Such a welcome change to mall food. The turkey panini is excellent, and the chicken tortilla soup is so delicious. Great selection of infused teas and water. Bye bye Panera!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The daily fresh teas and waters are DELICIOUS! My daughter and I always each get a salad with calamari added! Believe me I was surprised, but some of the best calamari around. The staff is always super friendly - and it's at the mall?!?! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm I am absolutely loving this spot at Carolina place , can't believe I never tried it before , healthy options but extremely tasteful! I got the coconut curry chicken and my daughter had the calamari , no complaints! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My fav spot to grab to go at least once a week. Great salads and chicken tenders with mac and cheese for the kiddos. Service is always spot on , glad I found this place !!!"}
{"text":"It's just OK.  Not sure if I was crazy about it, but my husband enjoyed it.  He ordered the salmon panini with chicken tortilla soup.  I tried it and his salmon panini was good.  But I must have ordered the wrong thing...Mediterranean salad with shrimp, the salad was not very fresh and the shrimp over-cooked.  I also got the lentil soup, but being middle eastern this definitely wasn't what I was expecting...it was so thick like a blob of beans.  Lastly we tried the almond crusted tuna small plate, which was not very fresh either and tasted like it had been sitting around for a while.  Overall I would not come back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed here!!! You HAVE TO GET THE MUSHROOM SOUP!!!! I'm imploring you!! It's the best ive ever had!!!  This place is always consistent with its quality and freshness."}
{"text":"Cannot believe you can get the quality and freshness for the price at the mall! I would put their quality tonight up against a way more expensive 3 star in the QC. They also have wine and beer. A huge selection of food, teas and lemonades that rival Teavana. Look forward to going back to the mall for more- wth is wrong with that statement !?!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this new concept in fast food fresh. Absolutely mouth watering steak panini with side salad.   Clean. Modernist decor. Comfortable and inviting atmosphere.  Heard of this place on WBT radio and it was straight on target. Will be back many times to come."}
{"text":"Omg! Do not overlook this place! It's better than the fast food downstairs. I ordered the coconut curry chicken. I couldn't believe how incredibly flavorful and delicious this was. I wish you could have seen how big my eyes got when I took my first bite.. It's SERIOUSLY THAT DELICIOUS! I thought it was awesome they had different drinks to chose from other than the normal sweet tea, fountain drink, or water. They had Rosemary lemonade, strawberry and mint water, coffee, etc. I opted for the Rosemary lemonade. Definitely delicious! The service was perfect. Greeted upon walking in, menu handed to you at the counter, order and it's to you quickly. Delicious.   The salad was absolutely incredible.  Okay, I don't want to sound crazy, but this may have made my top list of places to eat.   So please don't forget this place just because it's not in the food court."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed. The presentation of the food looks like art. Although I took mine to go it was delicious I was envious of those who are at the restaurant. We don't have these back home in Cali but I hope that someone franchises it there, if I had the money I'd definitely do it. I think it would do great in airports too. I got the Asian salad with seared tuna, next time no tomatoes. But the flavors meshed very well and it was refreshing for the 87degree day in March. Will be back I wanna try the bean burger"}
{"text":"I wonder how many times I can put in the word yum in the comments until I run out of space.. the food is delicious and so are the kids menu this is perfect for whenever I want to have something for my adult taste buds and still have something good for the kids. I tried the coconut curry chicken and it was delicious it also came with a salad with balsamic vinegar dressing was delicious I definitely had to get some to go when I packed up our food. I'm surprised and extremely excited that a restaurant like this is actually at this mall! the menu definitely has a lot to offer and I'm sure when I return I will try something new and will not be disappointed. The service was fast the food was hot and the service was also very great everyone was very friendly and I can't wait to take my family back here to try it out. I have officially found my new favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp as I dont live in the state. The food is restaraunt quality food court prices. I had the steak medallions which was 2 nice sized ( deck card size each) made to order. Came with mixed green balsamic dressing and huge fried grit cake. The tortilla soup was more vegtable with tortilla strips but very hot (TEMP) and very tasty. Service was excellent. Pay when you order then they bring it to you. Will come back when I visit. Everyone seemed passionate about the place and it shows in the finished product."}
{"text":"Who would think a place in a mall would be so  delicious! We came here with pretty low expectations but were blown away by the quality of food, the drinks and the affordability.  We each had half an Asian salad with soup, one wild mushroom and one creamy kitchen. The little one had Mac n cheese with fruit and lemonade. Speaking of lemonade you have to try their lemonades..so good! They have a variety of lemonades and teas, perfectly refreshing. Food was fresh, delicious and portions were HUGE!  We chatted with the GM, he was the epitome of southern hospitality. Actually every single staff member we encountered went out of their way to provide exceptional customer service.   Would we visit again? Oh course! This place blows away any other fast casual restaurants. If you are looking for fresh and healthy food options then look no further, you have to check this place out, you will not be disappointed!"}
