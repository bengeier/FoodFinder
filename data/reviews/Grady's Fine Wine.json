{"text":"Read an article about this place in the Scene Magazine and raced over to discover what it was all about.
We were welcomed with a tasting glass of wine and snacks, and of course a smile from the Owner, Manny.
What a great time we had!! Planned to just grab a bottle of wine and some cheeses, and ended up staying for a cheese and meat board, several glasses of wine and some AWESOME company.
Fantastic for cheese, meats, an array of treats, wine, beer and great conversation.
Get your butt to happy hour on tuesdays from 5-8."}
{"text":"I love this place when I visit home. Manny (the owner) is a brilliant sommelier who can cater to any palate. My Mom drinks Sutter Home, Manny always finds a nice rose to accommodate her taste. I love my reds, and there is always a fun new Spanish or South African varietal Manny introduces me to. And if you're a beer lover (like I am), his selection blows most big stores and other specialty shops out of the water. Cleveland is one of the best beer towns and this shop celebrates that culture to a T! Thirsty Dog, GLBC, plus awesome selections from other micro-breweries in NY and California, Colorado, etc. This is a must stop, even if you're an east-sider, there's really nothing like it in town. It's a destination shop, especially for the foodies/wine/beer/booze lovers!!"}
{"text":"From the fantastic wine selection to the outstanding service, this is the local wine shop you must go to. The craft beer, hand made sandwiches, desserts, and food vendors being represented really embraces the local vibe.  Catering options and Manny the owners' wine knowledge can guide you through whatever type of event you are hosting or attending. 
Hit one of the tastings and you'll see as well as be back for more wine, food and fun!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent both the Tuesday \"Happy Hour\" wine tastings as well as the Saturday afternoon wine tastings. They are both absolutely incredible deals! In addition to providing between 4 - 6 different wines to taste, Manny (the owner) cooks up delicious food to pair with the wine.

Manny is very knowledgeable about the wine offerings in the store and hand-picks all of the wine he stocks. I strongly recommend utilizing his knowledge if you need wine for a party, gala, or Wednesday night.

They have an excellent selection of cheeses and charcuterie, and Manny will whip you up a board of both to go with your tasting or to take with you.

And if that weren't enough, they keep a great selection of craft beers in stock.

We're lucky we live down the block, but would certainly recommend this as a destination spot for those looking for great food, amazing wine options (that change daily!), and a wonderful owner who is passionate about what he does.

A tip: Friend them on Facebook and you'll have the low-down on upcoming tastings as well as any goodies that he is cookin' up."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!

Under new ownership Manny has taken this store to a new level.  He has the best imported Italian lunch meats and Cheeses.  He has a fantastic happy hour and wine tastings and is a pretty cool guy to hang out with.
STAFF: Friendly and knowledgeable
LOCATION: In the heart of Rocky River with ample free parking
PRICE:  Very reasonable for what you get.  

RUN DONT WALK and check this place out.  Its just fantastic and you feel like your hanging with friends you knew all your life.  I am privledged to know of such a hidden gem."}
{"text":"So yeah...major fail on my part. I've ignored this place based on the assumption they were a wine place. I'd love to say I frequent wine places...but I'm a craft beer girl.

This guy knows beer. I am looking forward to visiting again. He made a great recommendation just by listening to me a minute.

And he was very straightforward and human...someone I'd love to learn wine with. They have wine tastings twice a week. I need to do this."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  What a hidden gem. Went there for the Tues Happy hour.  For $10 you get a diverse wine tasting (I think I tried like 7 or so) and AMAZING food.  I did not intent on making a dinner out of the free appetizer, but that is what happened.  That night it was a seafood mac n cheese, wild mushroom risotto, bruschetta, cheeses, meats and a yummy cinnamon pinwheel cookie.  Hello yummy goodness.  The wine selection was pretty wide.  I was amazed at how reasonable the prices were.  I bought a bottle of pinot noir that cost me less at Grady's than it did at the actual winery that I just visited 2 months prior.  Plus the staff is just great.  I felt more like a friend than a customer by the time I left.  I will be going back not only for my wines, but for the weekly tasting for wine, food and new friends!"}
{"text":"I dont drink wine.  It gives me a headache and wine people usually need a good choking.  But this place has a pretty good beer selection!  They have a lot of LOCAL beer.....cmon Cleveland and stop shipping your hard earned beer money out of state!  Brooklyn, Maryland and Pennsylvania have enough damn money already.."}
{"text":"This little gem of a store is around the corner from my house, and I'm embarrassed to say that I just went for the first time. It's been under new ownership for several months, and apparently some changes for the better have been implemented. They have a wonderful and reasonably priced wine selection, some fantastic beers (including Hitachino White Ale, which I'm always delighted to see someone carrying), and some really good-looking cured meats and cheeses. You could assemble one heck of a picnic from this store alone. The only thing I had trouble locating was port; one selection, and it was a ruby. That aside, I definitely plan on being a regular here."}
