{"text":"Good sushi great service awesome lunch buffet for an unbeatable price. Love this place"}
{"text":"Discriminatory new \"rules\" ruin the experience.
Used to be somewhat regular for the ayce menu as the food is not bad and the price is used to be fair. Went tonight with my girlfriend who always opts for the sashimi for $2 extra. Fair enough, pay a little extra for the premium items. Reminded the server that I'm vegetarian and will just get the usual normal ayce. The server acknowledged she recognized us and explained the new rule if one person wants sashimi the vegetarian who won't be eating any fish at all is getting charged the same premium for the privilege for sitting at the same table. Not in those words obviously, but we definitely made sure we were on the same page before being given a few minutes to think it over. Contemplated walking out but decided to stick around as the tea was already poured. Usually we tip around 20 percent when we went here as I always feel at ayce the servers need to do a little more running around. Gave 10 tonight, the difference  being more than the $2 but it's the principal, felt a little bad but I was still annoyed. This has cost them regular customers and any future recommendations to friends or family. A shame due to the proximity to work and home."}
{"text":"Small, comfy, clean (!!!) place. Fresh and tasty food. Ill not mind to pay few more dollars for wider choice, but its just me...  They need a little help when get to busy, but over all its good matching  of price and quality of food."}
{"text":"That is my favorite  sushi place. Fish is always fresh and service is friendly. 
Also price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials sand the sushi is above average for your typical sushi spot in the GTA. So far, no problems with the quality of the food, I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Dropped into Sushi Huang for lunch and it was packed which is a good sign. Good honest to goodness ALCE sushi at a very reasonable price. The teriyaki salmon was very moist and succulent, so often it is cooked to a frazzle. Service was great in spite of being so busy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good AYCE then this place is great. Consistant. Ive been going once a week for the past 6-7 months. Fish is fresh. There are only about 30 seats and 1 waitress. Unless you are there on Friday at noon, service is decent.

Good people. Fast service. Cheap price.

Rarely disappointed. 

Now this is AYCE sushi - not high end. Your paying 10.99!!! 

Ive tried every place within 15 mins of here and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"It was the first time for me going there. Actually I was driving back to Toronto from Barrie that I felt hungry. I simply asked SIRI for the best sushi close to me. And Sushi Huang popped up. I came here based on the good reviews and I should say I agree  with good comments. The portions are not very big but are clean and decent dishes. The service was good. It is low key restaurant with pretty reasonable price for buffet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both got horrible food poisoning after eating here. Our first (and only) time at this restaurant, and within hours we were both violently ill. We each missed 3 days of work and therefore 3 days of pay. You get what you pay for when it comes to $10.99 lunch. Aside from the food poisoning, the food wasn't good anyway, and the service was awful. Never returning here, and I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible experience nobody dare visit this place! Me and my friends went for dinner and hated it, we explained we won't be leaving a tip and server charged us anyway by including it in the bill. Once we realized she refused to refund us and was laughing she got away with scamming $6 out of us. We disputed the transaction just for the point because I hate to see them get away with that. 
Very disturbing, they don't deserve your business.

BTW it's a family business so all of them that work there are all in it to screw people over. Check your receipt closely cuz they include tip & I've heard they do it to everyone it's not ethical, very illegal. I recommended Maple Sushi, very close around Yonge and Wellington area and well worth the extra minute drive to avoid this snake pit!"}
{"text":"The lady that works there is very rude. We are a family of four and attending for lunch. 3 adults (10.99 per person) had the lunch buffet and one child had a deluxe buffet (comes with salmon sashimi). We order too many salmon sashimi for my child by accident and we are almost finish lunch, I decided to help her out because we hate wasting food, she came to our table and yell at us and wanted to charged me $18.99 (deluxe adult price). Instead she charge $3.50 per salmon sashimi I ate. I understand their policy but my child is only 8! Oh and they charge tea for $2! Never coming back here."}
{"text":"I use to visit here a lot for ayce. The service was friendly, the food amazing and the restaurant quiet and clean. Its been months since I last visited but I plan to go here for the salmon bento box. The website lists their menu a long with prices, really convenient. I always went to senzaburu(sp?) Sushi in oak ridges but I found it to be over priced at $15(salmon bento) and it didn't even come with tempura. This location offers the same bento with more rolls and tempura and is cheaper. This will be my go to from now on. 
After visiting here yesterday, I must say that the customer service isn't that good. We didn't get refills of water up until we decided to leave and never got a refreshment of ginger and wasabi for the amount of sushi and rolls we ordered. Still friendly but not attentive."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  The rice was hard and fishy smelling sushi.   After leaving 3 pieces between the three of us. These guys had the nerve to charge us an additional 3$.   Do not come here.


Gave 2 stars at first.  Changed my mind.  1 star."}
{"text":"If you need a sushi fix at the south end of Aurora, this place will fit in quite nicely. I stopped in while waiting for an appointment, and ordered the AYCE, just because for a few bucks more it is nice to have the far wider variety than just a bento box.

I didn't go in hard like I do at Chitose, but I had a good representation of my favourite dishes.  Overall, quite good.  The tempura was slightly \"under crisp\" so that could have been amped up a notch.  Also the deep fried chicken wings had an odd flavour and could have spent some more time in the fryer to darken up the batter.

If I am in the area again, and stuck waiting and hungry, I'll stop in for sure."}
{"text":"Sushi Huang is my favourite place to order take-out sushi. They are one of the few who deliver in the area and my orders have always been excellent. The sushi always tastes fresh and delicious. Delivery is always fast and courteous.

Some of my favourite things at Sushi Huang are the Love roll, Crab spring rolls, veggie spring rolls and the Aurora roll. 

I have only been for AYCE in the restaurant once, which I did not enjoy as much...the atmosphere isn't very appealing and the portions and quality are not as good as a la carte. I think it's worth it to pay a bit more for the good stuff and try out some of their specialty rolls.  Also going to stick with delivery so I can enjoy the yummy food at home."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout here. 

We ordered the 33. House Special Roll, 34. Rainbow Roll, and 40. Black Dragon Roll, which all came as 8 pieces each. The call was instantly responded by a waiter and they told us the wait was going to be 15mins. The order came down to about $24 before tax. 

I think the maki rolls were alright, kind of similar to what you'll get at an AYCE sushi place. The House Special Roll was a little weird though, in the sense that it was warm due to the grilled salmon on the top of the rolls. We didn't really it as much. 

PS. ask what the daily special is, because when we were there to pickup our foods the daily special was $5 off the 40 piece set combo (discount from $25 to $20)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know what happened here. Cheapest AYCE in the area, but you get what you pay for. I don't have any interest in returning."}
{"text":"Sushi Huang is very close to where my boyfriend lives.  We were craving for sushi so we decided to visit this place.  It's small inside and was pretty dead when we got there. It could be that it's a Wednesday night.  The staff were eating dinner when we got there but we were seated right away.  Sushi Huang also offer all you can eat option or a la carte.  I didn't feel like eating all you can eat so we ordered from the a la carte menu. I had the beef bento box which comes with miso soup to start, it was luke warm.  The bento box had 3 California rolls, shrimp and vegetable tempura, beef which are shredded in small pieces like bulgogi and smothered with teriyaki sauce. Also there's steamed rice and seed weed salad. I don't really like my beef all in tiny pieces so I didn't enjoy the meat. Also my tempura was not crispy it was a little soggy. My boyfriend got the green dragon roll and a order of tempura with rice. The service was great but the food on the other hand was so so. I probably would not come back since there's better sushi places out there. The prices however was very affordable. $10 for a bento box is not bad at all."}
