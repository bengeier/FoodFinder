{"text":"Just got back from dinner with 2 other couples.
Decor is warm, inviting. Service and food - not! Very slow service and cocktails were mostly ice ,$8 is overpriced.
Hummus was very bland and pita bread was dry. Aladdin's is so much better.
Nothing special...."}
{"text":"What a surprise. My friend and I couldn't decide what to have for lunch, so we decided to split a few appetizers. What a great choice. The calamari with pineapple habanero sauce was wonderful. The Grilled Polenta with Braised Wild Mushrooms in a red wine sauce is something that melted in your mouth. We also enjoyed the Potato Basil Wrapped  Ahi Tuna.

All in all, the food was wonderful.  A nice selection of wines compliment the menu. Attentive service. I know I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Wow! About time a place like this opened in Mayfield. Don't know how I missed it for so long. Amazing menu, great decor and vibe, good service, and great flavors. Could be the new hotspot for all the Progressive employees. Highly recommended.

[EDIT 7/23/2011] The quality of the food has fallen off in subsequent visits since my initial review.  As a result, I have reduced my rating to 3 stars."}
{"text":"NAYA Bisto gave me a good vibe from the moment I stepped in the door. With modern sleek decor, it still manages to be warm and welcoming with it's rich, inviting tones. I also love the fact that the restaurant utilized green building techniques and chose local and natural materials.

But it doesn't stop there. The restaurant also always uses organic, local produce whenever available. In addition, they serve free-range chicken, hormone-free beef and organic wines. Nothing like a restaurant that goes the extra mile in providing the best ingredients available.

I ordered the soup and salad and was thrilled when this delicious bread an olive oil was served. The olive oil was infused with rosemary -- so delish!

The soup was made with root vegetables and roasted tomatoes and was pureed into a thick, flavorful broth. It had a bit of a kick, too! To accomany the soup, I ordered the NAYA salad, which contained brie, thinly sliced apples, cucumber, carrots and walnut vinaigrette. The Brie and apples were delicious together! No surprise there! Apples + cheese = heaven.

 am so thrilled that this new place is only a few minutes from my parents!  As great as Aladdin's and Yours Truly are, it's always nice to have new places in the rotation!"}
{"text":"I was prepared to give Naya a solid 3 but then remembered the rave review given by some of my friends for the same dining experience and thought I'd bump it up a notch.  One friend described it as his \"favorite meal in Cleveland\".  Not sure I'd go that far, but I'll agree that it was good.  What lowered this rating for me was the service.  I wouldn't call it bad, but it was lacking in many respects.  The food and drink service was slow and poorly timed, and at the end of the night the check was a mess.  Still, the staff was very polite and apologetic and the food really was pretty good.  Its absolutely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Like all the other reviewers have said, this place looks good when you walk in the door.  It's got a fresh feel and is relatively inviting.  The bar is well stocked and there is plenty of sunlight that beams into the restaurant through the massive wall of windows.

We stopped here for lunch after unsuccessfully finding the Dim & den sum truck in the area.  Let me start off by saying that the offerings on the menu look incredible.  I have found more restaurants recently with mediocre creativity displayed from their chefs.  You will not find that at Naya Bistro.  Most of the dishes have really interesting flavor combinations and there is an incredible a depth of vegetarian options that you simply don't find at many restaurants these days.  It is clear that the menu is well thought out, which I give props for.

The problem came with the execution of the food.  It took us a solid ten minutes to figure out what we were going to sample for our lunch.  My friend at lunch is a vegetarian, so he went with the Baked Eggplant with goat cheese and tomato puree to start.  I started with the Carpaccio Sushi with blue cheese and roasted peppers.  We decided to split the Mushroom Pita and Vegetable Burger since we were both interested in those dishes and the manager said that both were good sellers.

The eggplant dish was clearly marinated in some type of oil based marinade.  It arrived and looked nice on the plate, but had a very greasy feel.  The best bites are those that are completely loaded with tomato and goat cheese, otherwise it just tastes like some heavily oiled eggplant.  The tomato puree was under seasoned, probably intentionally since it would be expected to be eaten with the goat cheese which is naturally salty.  The goat cheese ran out before the eggplant or the tomato, so the last couple bites just tasted blah.

I was psyched for my Carpaccio Sushi.  It arrived looking great on a very cool plate which separated out the sweet soy.  There were six rolls on the plate.  I asked the manager for some chop sticks to which he replied that they had none, work it out with a fork.  Strange, right?  Buy some cheap chop sticks- the dish looked great, why tarnish it straight off the bat without the proper utensils?  Anyhow, that wasn't nearly the biggest issue with the dish.  It is made with what they call a wasabi risotto.  It was a risotto, but not wasabi and the rice was so undercooked that it was almost painful to eat.  The blue cheese was non-existent within the rolls.  I disassembled a roll just to see if there was blue cheese there, and rest assured there was not.  What happened here?  The concept is so cool, but the execution so poor.  What a disappointment.

Well, we were still looking forward to the pita and the veggie burger.  The manager told us that the burger was made in house, which is pretty cool.  Most restaurants simply use a Morningstar burger or something.  The plate showed up and the kitchen took the responsibility of giving each of us half a burger and half a pita.  The manager never asked what kind of fry we would like, so they gave us both sweet potato and regular fries.  The good news is that both types of fries were great.  The kosher salt on the sweet potato fries was just the right amount and the regular fries tasted like fair fries- really fresh.  

The veggie burger looked great.  You could see the broccoli and cauliflower in the patty itself.  There was what they called a spicy vegetable spread on the burger, but most of it was absorbed by the bun.  I scraped some off with my knife, it wasn't spicy at all.  The burger could have used a lot more of the spread though since it was dense and gummy.  The flavor was good, but it was sort of like eating vegetable spiked paste.  I was glad that we split the burger.  Eating a whole one would have been hard to do.  We were in agreement that this was a dish to pass on.

The moment of truth: the Mushroom Pita.  The manager said that this was one of the best selling dishes on the menu, literally flying out of the kitchen.  We asked him how he liked it and he replied that he was allergic to mushrooms.  Ok.  It is described as a braised mushroom stuffed pita with smoked gouda and crème fraiche.  The mushrooms tasted like they were canned.  You know, rubbery, flavorless and generally lacking in all respects.  The mushrooms were plated on top of the arugula, which sogged out into a watery green mess.  It said smoked gouda but was almost non-existent, so didn't add anything to the sandwich. The crème fraiche was just all right- it was really thick and tasted more like sour cream than crème fraiche.  After two bites of the sammy without the crème fraiche, I smothered it with the sauce and it was only marginally better.  

This restaurant should really have received one star based on the food that was delivered, but they are trying something that many other places won't even go near so I gave them a second star."}
{"text":"First, I liked the decor. It was modern, but was warm at the same time. The service was good as well.

My husband and I ordered the Mushroom pizza as an appetizer. the description said it had woodland mushrooms, brie cheese, and fresh thyme. We received a pizza with canned button mushrooms and no thyme visible. the only thing that was true was the brie.  It was such a disappointment! The flavor profile sounded so good, but we didn't receive what was on the menu.

My husband ordered the gnocchi and I had the ravioli. It was the same thing. The desctiption was great, but it wasn't what we received. The sage cream on my ravioli had no sage flavor at all.

If the kitchen could produce the description of the menu, it would have been much better. But since it was boring and blah, I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"As my husband and I left Naya Bistro, we discussed exactly the type of impression we'd had.  Neither one of us was put off by anything but at the same time nothing was memorable.  My husband, in fact, remarked that he couldn't even remember what it was he had ordered and I realized I couldn't either. This was literally minutes after leaving the restaurant.  

Naya, even though its ambiance is great and is tastefully decorated, struggles to be memorable.  We had a gift certificate so thankfully none of our own money was spent (besides tip).  There's just not enough going at this restaurant to make it worth the trip."}
{"text":"Just heard this place is closed, which is a bummer.  

We had several work dinners there, and the food was always delicious.  Chris always provided excellent service as well."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at the brand new Naya Bistro & Lounge tonight.  I'd scoped out the menu ahead of time online and wasn't sure what to expect, based on the strip mall locale, but I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing my meal was.  There were multiple vegetarian options for me to choose from.

I started off with the Invisible Cosmo ($7).  Why is it invisible?  Because it's clear.  I followed that up with the roasted tomato soup($5).  Vegetarian and delicious.  (any restaurant that serves a vegetarian soup gets bonus points in my book!)  It had a little bit of a kick to it, so it wasn't your typical tomato bisque.  For my entree, I tried the braised wild mushroom pita ($10).  I've had many mushroom and/or pita dishes in my day, but I can honestly say this was the best mushroom sandwich I've ever eaten.  Hands down.  The mushrooms were flavorful and the creme fraiche that came as an accompaniment added a nice garlicky flavor to the sandwich.  As an added bonus, homemade salt and vinegar chips came on the side.  They were fresh and salty and amazing.

My boyfriend had the soup of the day - a beef and black bean chili - and the seafood stew entree and really enjoyed both dishes.

Collectively, we liked the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It feels upscale, despite having a decent sized bar area with a mammoth tv.  The prices may be a bit steep for the neighborhood, but for the quality of food, it's well worth it.  Kudos to the staff for asking for frequent feedback, too.  They've only been open for less than a week but are asking patrons to let them know what could be done better.  

I wish this restaurant nothing but success.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other vegetarian options!"}
