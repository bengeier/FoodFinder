{"text":"The place deserves 5 stars on all account -service, ambience and the quality and presentation of the food. The owner himself delivered the food to my table. I ordered tandoori prawns for appetizers, butter chicken for main course with a butter naan and shahi tukra for dessert. The meal was overall excellent."}
{"text":"Had a re-visit recently... ahhh, the new decor is pretty.  The theme here is you are on an adventure feel, with collection of various items from all over the world.  Now there is a bar area--sadly I did not try any drinks because I was driving.

I think Barbur needed this.  Before, I felt old... but now, it looks fresh!  I guess they needed to separate themselves against all the other Indian restaurants nearby, which are much more aggressively priced.

Prices have gone up a tad in result.. but the curry quality is still top shelf.  I have yet to find another place that does butter chicken better than Babur."}
{"text":"A colleague and I were recently in Toronto for a conference. We happened upon Babur and decided to stop in for lunch. We loved the food, the atmosphere, and the service. Two days later, we decided to eat there again.  Both times, the restaurant was populated by maybe 3-5 other guests, so the owner was able to service our table both times.  The second time we ate here, the owner even jokingly said to my colleague and me, \"Same time tomorrow?\"

The next evening was rainy and miserable and my colleague and I decided to stay in and just have food from Babur delivered.  We ordered nearly $60 of food and were excited when it finally arrived.  We dove into the bag and began eating the samosas we'd ordered only to discover there were no utensils or napkins.  I called down to the hotel restaurant to explain that we'd ordered delivery and there'd been no utensils or napkins with our order.  The restaurant wanted to charge us $5 basically to \"rent\" these items; I declined.  Since the restaurant was relatively close, we thought that perhaps we could just ask the restaurant to bring us some.  

To make a long exchange short, I was put on the phone with the owner who basically told me that they don't include utensils or napkins because they assume that their customers have them.  As politely as I could, I countered that it would seem people ordering from hotels would not likely have utensils vs. those ordering from a residential address and that it would seem to make sense to include them in the carry-out order.  I told him that we could pay $5 for utensils from the restaurant, but that I was unwilling to charge my school for that.  (I work at an inner-city school and while $5 isn't much, every dollar counts - and yes, my colleague and I bought our food on our own, not on my school's dime.  And on principle, I'm not going to pay $5 to \"rent\" silverware and napkins!)  

What the owner said next floored us.  He told us that $5 shouldn't be a problem for us to pay since we were staying at a luxury hotel (we were not!) and if it were really an issue, we should just get the utensils from the hotel and since he still had our credit card number, he would just refund us the $5 we'd have to pay.  Or if it were that much of an issue, bring the food back and he'd refund it.  He then proceeded to hang up on us.  At this point, I was just frustrated beyond belief and lost my appetite.  My colleague and I packed up the food, I got dressed to brave the cold and rain, and I walked the food back to the restaurant for a refund.  When I returned to the restaurant, the owner did not acknowledge me and simply gave his two employees permission to proceed with the transaction.  

After two really great experiences in the restaurant and with the owner, I was just flabbergasted, disgusted, and disappointed that this third time was such a complete 180-degree turn from those experiences.  My colleague and I loved this little restaurant and recommended it to many of our colleagues at the conference we were attending.  The food is amazing, and it made up for the slow service both times we were in, but I can certainly guarantee that I will never set foot in this restaurant again nor will I recommend it to anyone, certainly not without warning.  Such a shame."}
{"text":"What's with the birds? I felt like everywhere I looked there was some sort of bird. The decor is a little too funky for my taste. 

I had the butter chicken and naan. Which was alright. I didn't feel like it was something to rave about. 

Definitely overpriced. Between one app, two entrees and water spend a little over 50. I'll stick to other Indian resturants closer to home."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but food didn't stay true to price.

Pros:
food tasted good
decor was very modern

cons: 
service was just ok
portions very rather small
didn't have tali

Babur is a great place to come if you are looking for a good tasting meal, but not if you are looking for truly authentic Indian cooking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian place in town, I'd come alone just for the golgappa chatt even if I wasn't hungry (might have actually done that). Atmosphere is classy and service is always great. Can't go wrong with the butter chicken and the aloo gobi, did I mention the golgappa chatt? Get that for sure.

Allow your self to be drawn in by the pink elephant!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Babur since it was located on the corner of Dundas St. and St. Patrick - quite a long time. Over a decade ago, the previous owner moved its location to Queen Street and the restaurant went upscale, decor wise and price wise. Even with the current owners, the food quality and flavour is still fabulous, but the portion sizes have really diminished. I didn't mind paying the higher prices for a great meal, but there is a break even point when the value is no longer there, and there is plenty of other competition in town. 

For example, we ordered two bowls of rice for three people, murgh chicken, eggplant bharta, mutton biryani and three lassi. No appetizers, alchohol, naan, etc. our lunch cost $78 before tip. Expensive yes, but if the portion sizes were ample for two people, I wouldn't be writing this review.

So if you decide to go, expect a classy atmosphere, great food, high prices and to leave still feeling peckish. 

For the price my choice now will be Amaya's Indian Room or Bread Bar. Once again, it is not about the cost, but rather the overall value."}
{"text":"I had a friend visit from Montreal who had her heart set on eating Indian food. So we looked at various options in the downtown area and settled on Babur.  I had been there before and figured it was a safe bet.

The ambiance for this place is truly trendy and amazing.  Unfortunately the food is just ok.

We ordered the spinach cheese dish Shalak Paneer which tasted really good. The tandoori chicken came with a red sauce and green peppers. When i had this dish at Cusine of India (which is now closed and only open for catering), it came on a sizzling plate with no sauce so that you could taste the chicken, the spices, and the tandoor oven grilling taste.  I was disappointed by this dish.  We had ordered the grilled red snapper but after taking our order, the waiter came back to inform us that there were no more red snappers. How do you run out of red snappers?!.  So we settled for the Monk fish.  The fish came in a creamy yellow sauced. It tasted salty and had a weird fishy taste.  My friend and i both had a hard time eating it.  For $18, it was the most horrible fish dish i've ever had. The house of india has this delicious tandoor grilled  fish that is very tasty.

The nan bread were also mediocre.

To top it off, there were only 2 servers and so the service was slow and the food took a very long time to come out.

I don't think i would go back. If i do, I might order other menu option.  

The meal came to $57 for 2 people. Add tip, it came to $65.  Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"WOW! I took my mom here for mother's day dinner this summer and it just knocked our socks off.

We ordered the Lamb chops - which was amazingly good. They gave us three pieces and it was 27 bucks, very pricey!

The ghosh bhiryani is amazing! they have cashews and dates. I absolutely loved it!! One of the best bhiryani's I've ever had. Again, very pricey! around 20 something. 

We loved our food and would definitely come here again when we have that amount of money to afford it. It's awesome, delicious food. Their quantities are extremely petit. That  bhiryani plate is not enough to fill even one person, why does it have to be so small, whyyyyyyyyyyy.

The lamb chops were awesome, but there were only 3 thin chops!! not enough for one person as well. Especially considering the price of 27 bucks. 

But I loved the food, it was amazingly delicious. One of the best Indian restaurants int he city."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and looking for some good indian cuisine.  I read a few reviews from some locals and thought I would give it a try.  Very good food and it is true about the atmosphere. It is a very open, clean, friendly place.  The food was good and the staff was helpful.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"I love Babur. However, i've been twice recently and it wasn't up to par. On one of my recent visits the usual awesome Buttered Chicken was not as good. Our last visit, the Buttered Chicken was better but still not as awesome as it usually is. Also, the scallops usually come in the best sauce ever. It's just so good. This last time, no where near the goodness I have come accustomed to tasting. 

Hopefully this is just a temporary glitch and all will be back to its regular great taste."}
{"text":"Great food,

Menu was a bit confusing as main items were described as a la carte
When the food arrived,  we received 4 plates of rice, 4 plates of roti and naan bread, 2 vege dishes with meat, our entrees and that was after already eatting our appetizers, samosas and pakoras which were phemonenal. Overall great experience,"}
{"text":"We have been going to Babur for about 10 years if I remember correctly.  It is our family's go-to restaurant for Indian food in Toronto.  It really is the best.

Among our favourite dishes are:  Butter Chicken, Lamb Rogan Josh, Aloo Gobi, Chana Masala, Naan (plain), Peas Pilao rice, Navrattan Biryani..... mmm I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  (please forgive the spelling if it's all wrong!  I'm spelling it all on memory).

In the past few years they have upgraded the decor to better fit in the neighbourhood, which was a great idea, as the old stark white tablecloths and leather chairs felt cold and dated, and not nearly as welcoming as the newer look.

The service is not always the greatest... a bit lackadaisical.   But the cleanliness wins me over where the service doesn't.  It can be pricey, especially if you want a few dishes - but go with a group so that you can order lots, try it all, and split the cost!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness!!!!!!!! 

The naan bread was okay, kinda oily. We ordered a veggie dish, the Shashklik Paneer and it was okay. It didn't make me rave, but others I ate with seemed to enjoy it. The Butter Chicken was amazzinngg. I loved it!!! It was a very delicious curry that suited my ultra sensitive stomach. Nothing tasted spicy, just nicely seasoned. Oh and rice was $5+ a bowl, which is outrageous. 

I would be back here in a heartbeat for that chicken."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Babur doesn't get the love it deserves, cause this is where I go for all my Indian naan-filled needs. Granted, I've never hit up any Gerrard east spots, but these gents always manage to satisfy.

I inherited a favourite order from my best friend, which consists of the following (to be shared): rice, black bean dahl (I don't know what it's really called) and an appetizer chicken tikka. Sometimes if we're feeling gluttonous, some butter chicken. All leave us feeling happy, warm and satisfied. The butter chicken is dangerously rich and creamy, the chicken tikka terrific with some lemon. 

95% of my experience has been take-out but I remember service to be quick and friendly. And over the phone, they started to learn who we were by our order!

Recently the place went through some renovations, so I'll be going back soon for the dine-in experience, and to check for any menu changes!

Best Friend Edit: \"You should point out that it's very important to get the APPETIZER chicken tikka. Appetizer.\""}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my Indian food.  But this place was really special. I had the Sikh kabob appetizer and the chicken tikka masala as an entree - both of which left my taste buds very happy.

The Sikh kabob was tender and flavorful, moist and actually large for an appetizer. Could have easily shared or had as an entree.

The Tikka Masala was made from the freshest of ingredients and the fresh peppers and onions and garlic were particularly evident. The chicken itself was roasted well, not over cooked, and tender.

The one hiccup with the dinner was the onion kulcha. When I explain to my server that the meal was spectacular except for the onion kulcha (which was undercooked and doughy) she apologized politely and took it away. Unexpectedly a few minutes later the chef came out of the kitchen and apologized for what he said was his mistake and delivered some fresh naan with his compliments. It was prepared perfectly and I used it to soak up what little remained of the sauce from my chicken tikka masala."}
{"text":"I dined at Babur last month as part of an epic 'five dinners in seven hours' food safari around Toronto.
The trendy little restaurant, located in the Queen West neighbourhood, recently underwent a slew of renovations and you can tell.
The dining room is beautifully under-stated. Bird motifs are omnipresent and various species are showcased in tiny oval black frames that hang along the entire length of the left wall.
A long wooden table in the middle of the dining room, smartly divided with low sheets of patterned glass, gives off a cozy and intimate setting.
Exposed brick walls and interesting light fixtures also work to enhance the atmosphere.
We ordered garlic naan bread and chicken vindaloo and were given a complimentary serving of pappadums.
The pappadums, which bear hundreds of bubbles, are light, moreishly crispy and combine brilliantly with the trio of accompaniments.
Meanwhile, the intense garlic aroma emanating from the piping hot naan bread is simply intoxicating. The bread, sprinkled with finely chopped pieces of cilantro and garlic, is baked to perfection and boasts beautiful charcoal burn marks.
The naan simply melts in your mouth and pairs beautifully with the chicken vindaloo.
The curry is deep red in color. The smell of the spices is invigorating and the dish is perfectly seasoned.
The potatoes and boneless chunks of chicken (yes, they're chunks as opposed to the stringy variety) help balance the richness of the decadent sauce.
My one major criticism of the dish, though, is that despite requesting that it be made extra spicy, the curry doesn't have enough of a kick. The spice knob could have been turned up at least five more notches.
Nevertheless, we lap up each last mouthful and walk out of Babur extremely satisfied.

{"text":"Lovely decor. By far the trendiest Indian restaurant I ever try. Food was pretty good but it's slightly pricey compare to other Indian restaurant. But, I must admit, it is the best Indian food in the Entertainment district."}
{"text":"Decided on a whim to have lunch here on Sunday (May 29th)afternoon.

Decent size. Personally, basement bathrooms following an obstacle course ....something out of survivor, annoy me. However is spacious... so points here. ^_^

Growing up back home I was used to a select type of cold drinks Thumbs Up, Fanta, Sunkist, Pepsi-Cola etc. Shockingly, you can get them all here. I wouldn't recommend it to those watching sugar levels. 

The server was a bit bored of his day job, gazing at the window  whilst leaning against the wall. I didn't blame him, it was a nice day out. He was polite but not very helpful with ordering. He mentioned this place was primarily Punjabi and/or Gujrati? (I have a feeling he was talking lotsOsmack) 
The menu is in a cheapy pink frosty type of binder. Weird?
The decor is vintage copper periwinkle & duck plate pictures meets Victorian war left overs.
 I dunno about the interior of this place, looks a tad wounded. :S

(THANK GOD THE FOOD MAKES UP FOR IT)
Order:
    Garlic naan - SOOOOOO GOOD, I dare anyone to try this and still NOT want to devour 20 more. it's (excuse the lame-ness) MIND BLOWING.
    Butter chkn - safe but sets the standard for the rest of the sauces. If it's too diluted,means less service. If it's overtly saucy, cheap on chicken. This was just right, the sauce was equally buttery and you can taste the tomato base. The chicken were breast chunks and cooked well before mixing with the sauce. 
    Pilli Pilli sweet & spicy chkn - retardedly spicy, but the chicken is nice and chunky. There is indeed a hint of sweet. If you can get over the ambulance-fire-truck-spice party your papillae will have to endure. 
   Daal - myeh. Black lentils. Not bad if you have options but not the best if you can only have veg. It's sort of bland after a while. 
   rice with peas - The rice was fine but the peas tastes as though they had been over cooked. Or just.... old. 
Our bill was $98.31
with tip - $108.31 for 3 people. 

over all = myeh. Perhaps if there was nothing else around and I hadn't had any oily food in a decade, i might go again.

xoxox

{"text":"The decor is nice and modern.  The food is tasty and authentic.  The prices are slightly higher than usual for Indian, but not excessively so.

The service was just ok.  They were kinda rushing us (they kept asking if I was done and if they could take my plate even there was still food on the plate and food in the common bowls).

I would go back if others wanted to, but I wouldn't rush to go again either."}
{"text":"one of the best indian restaurants i have been to, i had the butter chicken and the chicken korma, both were well cooked and with the right amount of spice, and we had the bread and rice with them and they were perfect together.

downside, the restaurant is pricey, the main meal does not come with the rice or the bread, and you have to order that separately.

location is perfect and its very close to Osgood subway station.

the atmosphere is great and its a bit intimate, its great for dates too. Overall good atmosphere minus the priciness"}
{"text":"This was my first Indian experience.  We were staying nearby in Toronto and saw Babur advertised in the hotel magazine.  Once we arrived, we were quickly seated, but it took about 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order--not only that, but he saw we were ready and passed us multiple times anyway.  Every time the older male who I assume was the owner disagreed with something someone said, he had a look of disgust on his face which was completely off-putting.  
We ordered chicken tikka misalla and chicken vindaloo--my chicken tikka was great and my boyfriend enjoyed his vindaloo, but the naan was so tiny and not worth ordering.  The food was way overpriced and the waited made a mistake on our bill. Speaking of the bill, that took another 20 minutes of direct eye contact and ignoring from the waiter to receive.  This place can keep it's hipster decor and crappy service. If you want good service and great food in Toronto, go to Trimurti on queen street."}
{"text":"They've seemed to scale-back their menu since I last went there as many items have been removed.  I was disappointed as several fantastic items weren't available to order.  Their portion sizes have also been scaled back a little.  With the prices that customers are paying, it's a little disappointing.  The food is still excellent though."}
{"text":"Well, what began as a lovely and relaxing meal ended a bit ridiculously. Turned away from our first choice, we headed to Babur for a civilized lunch on a cold Friday afternoon. The decor was minimalist and attractive, and the smells emanating from the kitchen were intoxicating--at least to those who were starving. The poppadum arrived--tasty--and we ordered a range of dishes, including the haryali kebabs, salad with tamarind dressing (delicious!), malai kofta, paneer korma, chicken saag, and peas pulao. While everything was tasty,  nothing was incredible, and the service lagged significantly. Another table was served before us, even though we had ordered before them, and when offered some additional rice, we were charged $5. Yes, that's right, $5 for a cup of cooked white rice. Ridiculous. When the bill came, we realized that we had spent a total of $13 on rice alone, and the total was over $90--with nothing but water to drink! That's an expensive lunch for three anywhere, but considering it was Indian cuisine only makes matters worse. We laughed, paid, and left--only too gladly. And it's too bad, because Babur could be good, with larger servings, lower prices, and an entirely new waitstaff. Alas."}
{"text":"Came here Tuesday for a bite to eat with a friend. He's been raving about the place, saying its a great and classy Indian place. It was a miserable day outside and I arrived 30 minutes before he did so I had to content myself with a chai tea and my book, while waiting for him. There were three staff on duty and no other customers. 

Eventually another table came in and my friend waltzed in at around 12:10. We ordered the Crab Cakes with Raspberry to start.  (this would not have been my choice, I would have been much more inclined to go for the Samosas or Pakoras) That being said, the crab was nicely executed, with a nice freshness and a sauce, that while sweet, did not overpower the crab. There was also a nice garnish of what seemed like long grains of some kind of wheat. 7/10

For my main, I ordered the Veal Tikka after I specified I wanted something mild and my friend, the Lamb Korma (or Qourma on their menu). We also got two orders of Nan. The Veal was good with alot of subtle flavour and good amount of spice. Certainly not as greasy as some Indian I've had. 

The Qourma was the real stand out. A great blend of spice, sweet and good quality meat. Too bad I ordered something different


I will be back when I feel like coughing up the extra $$$$ for Babur. It is a few dollars more than most of the Indian Places I frequent.

7/10"}
{"text":"Like many people who are Yelping about Babur, I have been coming here for a long time-- since I moved to Toronto in 1998.They really do an amazing job of spicy, well balanced curries without sacrificing that punch of Indian Heat. They also used to have the best lunch buffet in the city, but they stopped doing this about 5 years ago.

Butter Chicken is always my acid test for Indian food and Babur's Butter Chicken is absolutely the best I've had in Toronto. Its creamy, sweet--- but no too sweet-- with nuts, a great spice level and the chicken is always tender and juicy--It's what keeps me coming back here (and I used to go once a week about 10 years ago). I was also a fan of the Masala Beef and the Saag Paneer. 

I'm not sure if they still do it, but they used to start you off with complimentary papadams, these delicious spicy carrot bits with black mustard seeds, tamarind chutney and coriander chutney. All were delicious.

10 years ago, I would have given Babur 5 stars. Hands down. But in recent years, I've had some service issues and haven't gone back. The last time I was there I was on a strict diet avoiding grains and starches, so my friend and I declined the waiter's suggestion that we order rice with our curries. We didn't receive rice, but we were charged $5 for it anyway! I had to argue with the waiter, telling him that we hadn't ordered any rice and he waffled, saying that he'd have to take my credit card back, print up a new bill and refund the transaction so he could ring it through again without the rice. He pointed out that he was very busy and that this procedure would take him some time. We were meeting friends for a show and had to leave. I was pretty angry and haven't gone back since. Most of the time, I've found the service to be cool and stand-offish.

I might give them another try because the food is so great, but I have noticed that the portions have become much smaller over the years and I'm not a fan of the new decor. Seems like it's all about flash these days and less about the food. I'll write and update after I return."}
{"text":"I've been going to Babur once in a while for a couple years now. The food is consistently good, and they are one of the only Indian places i've found that serves kulfi ( Indian ice cream - try it, it's delicious). My only criticism is that the prices have gone up lately, so I can't afford to go as often. But I do recommend the pilli pilli (sp?) chicken (if you like some spice), and their Biryani never disappoints. I had one bad experience where our kulfi was served to us already melted, but when we said something they quickly replaced it with new servings, so no complaints there."}
{"text":"I have been going to Babur for years and years and years and it really is the best indian that you can get. Anywhere.

Love the staff. Very nice, and professional. 

Everything is scrumptious and I really enjoy every time I go to Babur."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Indian restaurant I've ever tried! It is located on Queen in the Entertainment District, has nice decor, and prices are decent for what you get. The service is very friendly and the food is not overly heavy or greasy like other Indian places I've tried. My favorite dish is the lamb korma. It's nutty and delicious! Also try their rice and their naan bread. Mmmmmmm :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here once, and while the food is half-decent, I happened to learn some worrying facts from the server. The waitress seemed overworked and tired, and after our over-priced but satisfying meal, I thanked the waitress for her service and she just gave me half a smile. I asked her what was wrong and she whispered that the owner keeps all the tips for himself, and she barely manages to make $9/hour for her labour. She was single handedly serving the whole restaurant while the owner was at the back enjoying a drink. I chatted with him after the meal and he proudly boasted that he had owned this restaurant for 30 years. 

If you're interested in an over-priced north Indian food in a swanky neighbourhood at a restaurant with dubious ethical standards, by all means, drop by. But in my humble opinion, there are better, cheaper Indian restaurants out there who don't exploit their employees."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Food is amazing!! All the dishes were great and the right proportion of naan/rice to dishes. The tandoori chicken was to die for!
2. Service is great!! Attentive, useful, professional, and helpful in choosing dishes/desserts.
3. Warm atmosphere. 

CONS:
1. Washroom is a little funky."}
{"text":"Boooo! I seriously feel like this place bent me over the communal table in the middle of the restaurant and gave it to me wrong. Service was slow, waitress was awful, portions were small, flavors were mediocre at best.... and the worst part, the waiter/owner could tell we'd been waiting an hour too many for our APPETIZER and asked if we wanted some rice... oh, that's nice... we thought, at least they're being sensitive... NO! HE CHARGED US $8! FOR RICE!

AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE SCHITZY SCABBED METH HEAD PLAYING WITH HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THIS PLACE. IF YOU EAT HERE AFTER READING THIS YOU DESERVE WHATEVER HAPPENS TO YOU!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Firstly I'd like to point out how refreshing it is to go to an Indian restaurant that doesn't look like every other Indian restaurant in the World! The decor here is modern and refreshing and is what initially attracted me to give Babur a second look. 

I went to dinner here on a Saturday night and it was packed...always a good sign. I tried the butter chicken, chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka, and the naan. Everything was great and tasty...the naan perfectly cooked although I thought too small. 

So why do I give it 4 and not 5 stars if I'm raving about the food? The service was awful. We had a reservation yet the wait staff tried to put us at the back of the restaurant while other areas were free. Second, the waiters were frantic and the food came out all too fast. Thirdly my curry got cold while I waited for my second piece of naan to arrive (which it never did).

So all and all I enjoyed my food but my experience could have been much better."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant, and it turned out to be one of the best Indian restaurants that we've been to in the city! Although the restaurant is on the pricier end of the spectrum, the food we had was delicious, especially the monk fish and scallops. Both were cooked perfectly and the sauces that came with the dishes were great to dip my bread in. I liked the decor of the restaurant as well, particularly the exposed brick wall on one side."}
{"text":"Please note that this review is for the overall experience, NOT the food, which I would give 3.5 stars. 

I went with a friend last night and we had:
- papadoms
- butter chicken
- chicken tikka masala
- saag aloo
- rice
- garlic/reg naan
- coke/water

The food was very tasty but there were a few serious issues. Firstly, the papadoms were served with such a tiny amount of sauce it was ridiculous - I honestly thought they were joking. You could barely get the end of the piece wet! Then, the tikka masala was served in a weird sauce, closer to sweet/sour than true tikka masala. The butter chicken/naan/saag aloo were all awesome - expertly prepared. The main problem was the bill. 2 people, no appys, no alcohol - $85! I agree with Kitty S - at least on the value part. I won't be back - go to Jaipur Grill instead if you want high end Indian - better value for the money and food is better."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times in the past few months. it's the first place I think about for great curry in Toronto."}
{"text":"Babur serves solid upscale Indian food at even more upscale prices.  

The FOOD:  We had the goan prawn curry and the Indian favorite palak paneer.
***Goan Prawn Curry: $21
Anyone want to guess how many shrimp come with this?  
Well, I'll tell you...it's 5. The relatively simple, flavorful, slightly spicy curry accompanies the 5 shrimp..there are no vegetables or anything else in the mix...just 5 lonely shrimp at a whopping $4+ per shrimp.  

***Palak Paneer: $13
This is a pretty standard, slightly spicy rendition of saag (palak) paneer.  Not too much more to say...at least the price is slightly more reasonable.

***Garlic Naan: $5
Nice tasty naan with a more subdued garlic flavor than most.

***Rice: $5
Yep, you read that right...a side of rice is a whopping $5.  Ouch!

The menu is a pretty extensive mix of over-priced, but fairly well-executed North Indian Cuisine.

The SERVICE:  Generally fairly attentive, although it was a quiet night.  We were generally happy with it.

The VIBE: This is a nicely decorated, somewhat more modern Indian restaurant.  It's nice to see something exceeding the classic decor.  

OVERALL: I would rate the food and service a solid 4 stars; however, there is no other way to say that this place is over-priced for what's served...especially for the prawn curry.  Gotta knock 'em down a peg to 3 stars for that.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Probably our favorite Indian restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been a devotee of Babur since a group of us (from work) visited one day for their lunch buffet (which has been discontinued)
It is far and away one of the best Indian restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at. As with most Canadians, the litmus test for me is their Butter Chicken. Hands down, the best I've had (other than homemade) and is the main reason I keep going back.
Like most reviews, I've noticed some issues with service in the last few years, but with food this good, I'm willing to overlook some bad service experiences.
A bit more expensive than other restaurants, but if you're looking for quality vs portion size, this is the place to go.
Wish they'd bring back their lunch buffet...it was spectacular"}
{"text":"I've had a long history of eating at this restaurant, and do feel that the new decor looks out of place. That being said, the place is catering to touristy foot traffic, and the prices and new look reflect this. 

They've generally had good quality food, but portion sizes are beginning to diminish in the hopes of attracting a more Western crowd. The buffet service, though tacky and typical of Indian restaurants, was really what made Babur a great lunch spot.

If you're someone who purely goes for butter chicken, I'd recommend Babur's. It's not the greatest, but it certainly trumps the other two restaurants that lie east of Babur, and is within the downtown core.

If you're into spicy fare, you really have to tell the wait staff about this request. Another unfortunate evolution of their food is that it's not as spicy as it use to be in an effort to cater to a non-spicy eating crowd."}
{"text":"The decore is modern with lots of open space. The dishes we had was the best Indian food I ever tried. The service, even though not fully organized, was acceptable. For sure will come back again"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Have tried many dishes and all are well flavoured. The decor is also nicely done. Babur is a Queen St. mainstay. I brought 8 business associates visiting from India and all of them were impressed with the food. How's that for an endorsement!"}
{"text":"What a lovely dining experience!  The restaurant interior is very attractive.  It's simple and clean and looks like it has been recently remodeled.  The food is excellent.  The savory samosas appetizer was very good.  My lamb korma was delicious, and I wish that the portion size had been slightly larger.  One of my dinner companions ordered an off-menu side dish that he knew they would be able to put together, and it was no problem at all.  The service was great and the overall experience was fabulous."}
{"text":"I'm simply amazed at how great, delicious the food was. Along with its great decor: Cozy look with the mix of casual and a little fanciness. I ate butter chicken as my main course, butternut squash soup as an appetizer and house wine (white) for a drink. Lastly, white chocolate berry for dessert. All of which were DE-LI-CIOUS. 
Me and my girlfriend, we were more than pleased to be here. Very quick service, kind staff, amazing food! Definitely recommend it, one of the best food experiences I've had in a while. A 10/10"}
{"text":"I love me my Indian food and had actually never been to Babur before, so was extra game when I heard that it had recently gotten a face lift. I wouldn't be able to compare the before and after, but different is supposed to be better, right? The decor proved to be the highlight of the dining experience. The ornate plates featuring birds decorating the wall, the long wooden tables, the fabulous chandeliers, the handwritten drinks list on the chalkboard, and the banquets were just delightful in a modern eatery sort of way. 

The plain (a.k.a. sweet) lassi ($4.50) was rich and yogourty, but a little too sweet. The paneer quorma ($11.99) was satisfyingly creamy, but super spicy (not at my request) and peppered with chunks of whole herbs and spices that weren't meant to be eaten. I also suspect that the palau rice ($3.95) would've been better with the peas that it is no longer served with (or maybe they should've used white out instead of just crossing the word out).

In the now gorgeous bathrooms, the door of the right stall does not fit into the frame and cannot close, let alone be locked. In the left stall, the toilet paper wasn't fitted properly and popped right out of the holder. I'm sure that won't happen to everyone though.

The service wasn't bad. But then again, my vegetarian dish was mistakenly presented by the serving assistant as lamb and that took me by surprise. Oh, but he was just kidding, it was paneer after all!"}
{"text":"Food was good, kind of pricey for small portion sizes though ($15 entrees, $10 appetizers, $8 desserts, etc).  Very nice atmosphere, with lots of pictures of birds for some reason.  Tables and general setup was very classy, and the waiters were very attentive.

We got 2 entrees and 2 pieces of naan for lunch and we left kind of hungry (total came out to ~$50 for two people).  Butter chicken and a lamb dish (can't remember what it was called, had a red sauce).  Both were tasty, lamb was kind of chewy and the butter chicken was pretty average."}
{"text":"The creamy, white meat butter chicken, spicy, deep flavored lamb rogan josh and aloo gobi, garlic or plain naan...... 

My 5 hr flight to Toronto often leads to an evening at Babur and I love it every time I go. Cold, delicious beers, great breads, easy location and top notch ingredients in classic Indian dishes makes this my favorite Indian restaurant of all time. 

Seriously. The butter chicken, lamb rogan josh and plain buttered naan are the best, ever."}
{"text":"If you really want an indian restaurant and do not want to travel to little india, you may end up there. Or in another one nearby. 
Deco is not so bad. This being said, it remains difficult to find another reason why to choose this one rather than another one... nans were not good and cooked in regular oven. Lassi was clearly from a processed bottle. Pani poori were not freshly baked and tasted like fried a couple of years ago. Lamb was ok. So... i wish i could remove the yelp sticker from the entry door.... not bad, not good... but so many other and likely better ones to try around..."}
{"text":"Nice decor and the service was fine. We ordered appetizers including samosas and mulligatawny soup, main courses such as lamb, beef, shrimp and saag paneer. The food was very good. We ordered a half litre of red house wine. At $23 we thought how bad could it be. Unfortunately it tasted like vinegar."}
{"text":"I will agree with the other reviews that the decor is nice and a refreshing change from most other Indian restaurants.

There were four of us eating the night we went.  We had the Vegetable Somosas, Vegetable Pakora and Mulligatawny Soup for our starters. The Vegetable Somosas had nice flavour but were under cooked; the Mulligatawny Soup was a little too salty. Vegetable Pakora were very good and I would get those again.

For our mains we had the Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Chicken Vindaloo and the Beef Masala with rice and Naan. We would order all again with the exception on the Tandoori Chicken, it again was a little too salty.
The menu while not the biggest has enough on it to satisfy most people. The drink menu is about the same, not large but enough. The service was good on the night we were there.

While I liked the food, I don't feel the need to run back anytime soon. I would recommend this place for a group of people looking for Indian food in a cool place, in a nice part of town."}
{"text":"Trendy little Indian restaurant with fantastic food. Although the decor in this place is hip and modern, the food is decidedly authentic. 

It looks as though some of the reviewers had so-so service, but ours was great. The waiters weren't overly attentive, but in a good way. 

We had the rhogan josh, saag paneer and channa masala. All delicious. If I went back again, I might have to eat the rhogan josh and saag paneer all over again! Babur serves some of the best I've had of either dish. 

The portions weren't huge. We had a party of 4 people and shared three dishes, with rice and two orders of garlic naan - and left satisfied by not overly full (which was ok for a late dinner, but you might want to order more).

Super place, with great food and a nice, unique atmosphere for an Indian restaurant. Next time I'm in Toronto, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ah Babur... I agreed in going here with a group of colleagues, b/c I personally thought Babur was the name of a childhood elephant.  Turns out, Babur isn't the name of that character, after all.  http://www.fanpop.com/spots/babar-the-elephant
~~~~~
Yelpers, Babur was ok, but for a group of 13, food did not arrive until well over 1.5-2 hours later!  We were too hungry, and hated eyeing other tables as they were served first (there was another party table there).

The food itself was ok too, a bit oily - which I'm okay with, but not one of my colleagues.

I had the eggplant, which was very rich, plus garlic naan bread, and a mango lassi.  My total came out to about $24 plus tip.

One colleague spazzed out at the saltiness of what she thought was monk fish.  Turns out she dug into the wrong order (red snapper), she liked her monk fish fine.  If you don't like salty fish, don't order the red snapper.

If we didn't wait SO long for the food, I would have given them a 3 or 4.  But I was ticked and feeling Arrrrrrrrrrrr by the time the food arrived.  Some of us noticed the lack of food multiple times.  :(

I probably wouldn't want to go back, there are so many other places I'd like to try.  However, if you're in a group of 2 or 4, I think you would have a much better experience than the one my group did."}
