{"text":"why people complaint about this place is beyond me,you get what to pay for,you want to save money by going to a low price place,and you succeed,stop crying about it,want more then pay more money and going to a more expensive place,this is my tip to you!"}
{"text":"Also known as Jolly's Fast Food and Donuts (but they don't sell donuts, at least not in the traditional sense).   This place is a HK style cafe.   We came here by accident as we wanted something quick after an appointment up the street and had little or no expectations.   As a result, we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed our meals.   We had a plate of Blackbean Beef with rice noodles and a porkchop with rice and egg combo.   It could be described as a \"hole in the wall\" type of operation, but we found value and good food and their milk tea is pretty good too.   We will be back and my hope is that I can upgrade my review to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Service was on the slow side, and the beef brisket soup noodles were on the disappointing side. My brother ordered a club sandwich and he said it was surprisingly good.   Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"not the best, very plain no frills food.  just a place to get a quick bite... dont expect great cuisine.   it would be ehh.. average at its best.  probably wont come back"}
{"text":"Service was quick.  Good was tastey, hot, good quality, and well priced.  Only issue was the lunch specials were only in Chinese, thankfully my wife can translate.  They do have regular menus in English, though.  Decor is old, but makes me think of a cheap (but good) place in HK."}
