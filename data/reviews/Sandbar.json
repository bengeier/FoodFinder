{"text":"In the scheme of things, Sandbar is a great alternative to the Scottsdale scene.  It is a little less dressy and a little more casual.  The food is good for what is worth -- Mexican bar food.  But, I love going there because the crowd is a bit more chill and its a little more relaxing than the other places in the area.  There are a lot of TV's, which is nice to catch a sports game.  There are private patio cabanas, but I have never used them.  This is a great place to hang outside in the sandy patio for happy hour or to get your groove on the dance floor during the weekend nights."}
{"text":"The place is an absolute trainwreck. And here's why: The night started with a 35 minute wait in line, while tight shirted MMA wannabes paid the \"VIP\" doorman to let them and their 30 closest friends in before us. We were in line so long that people in front of us bailed and it seemed like every person leaving was yelling to those of us in line about how horrid the scene was inside. But we decided to stay because we had always enjoyed the one in north Scottsdale. Bad idea.  Once we finally got up to the doorman, he gave us the \"whatever\" distant stare and held his hand up in a \"I'm holding an ID\" move. No hello, or welcome to sandbar. Then they charged us $5, which would be fine if the girl collecting the cash wasn't also cold and unattentive.  But whatever, we're in let's have some fun! Wrong.  The bar was busy but not packed, making us pretty angry that we were in line so long. But still we couldn't get a drink. We flagged down 3 different bartenders (who all had the exact same huge upper bodies, tiny legs and spiky hair) until the ONE person there doing their job approached us. It was a small female bartender who was sweating and sprinting around the bar while her male counterparts sat around discussing the merits of the Jersey Shore and spray on tans.  We had a drink and walked around. The ambience is dull and unimpressive, the bouncers were all busy talking to girls, the interior has super low celings and tiny booths, the outside looks like you're at a bar in Rocky Point that was half built but opened anyways.  The crowd was pretty awful too. Lots of bumping with no \"excuse me\", tons of way too drunk people and very, very poor on the guy to girl ratio.  After a failed attempt to get another drink, we left the bar, confident that not only will we not return to this poorly designed, awfully mismanaged bar, but we will avoid the other sandbars at all times as well.  Sorry to be a downer, I was anticipating a really fun night at a new place, and it ended up just being a complete waste of our time."}
{"text":"Well I thought the food was good and atmosphere great. Service was ok but the problem is the autogratuity of 18%. What is the point? Basically im forced to tip even if the service is terrible? No thanks."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the Scottsdale Sandbar is definitely a lot of fun. I'm not a huge fan of the food though...in a pinch it'll do. Guess if I'm eating I'd rather really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Great place to watch an Iowa Hawkeye game!  There is a HUGE Iowa following in the Phoenix area that meetup regularly at the Sandbar on Saturdays during football time.  And it gets crazy!  They turn all of the TVs to the Iowa game.  Everyone is drunk by lunch because the games start at 9.    Drinks are pricy, and there is a high DB count in this place, but the scenery is nice.    Be careful about parking, though."}
{"text":"Lots of eye candy, however that's it. Auto gratuity  equals terrible service. The bartenders have an attitude to boot.  I would have given one star but the food was good and drinks were strong."}
{"text":"sandbar is an attractive place. i went there with a couple buddies to check out the happy hour. ive been here a couple times before but usually on a weekend and wasted and its pretty cool then.  we sat at the outside bar where the sand is. if i thought about it i wouldve brought sandals. im joking.  happy hour is good. 1/2 off apps and drinks, so roughly $2 domestic pints.   we mostly enjoyed the food we had. i got the carne asade fajitas. good stuff.   cool bartender and plenty of girls to round out the atmosphere.   surprisingly i didnt get wings this time, but ill be back, and will update this review."}
{"text":"Sand in a bar in the AZ? While I thought this was too good to be true when the north Scottsdale bar first opened a few years back, I soon found out it wasn't and Sandbar has become one of my favorite Scottsdale bars.   The beach bar features a sand-covered patio, private patio cabanas, an ample margarita menu, delicious Mexican eats and a small pool. The restaurant and bar is decorated with bright decor and the dance floor is a hot spot on the weekends.  Now if only they would add an ocean!"}
{"text":"So I was there a few days ago and really liked it. Food was good, the steak nachos were awesome and the burger good. I thought it was very reasonably priced though I was there during Happy hour (3-7?) so a lot was half off. Still 5 dollars a beer is about average in Scottsdale and half off is even better. The service was good and the bartender was funny and prompt with the drinks. I will definitely go back and recommend it to any of you."}
{"text":"I've lived here for two weeks and have happily been to this bar three times.  Every time, awesome!  Rad bartenders that make tasty margaritas, delish guacamole, and I always find great clientele to mingle with.  HOWEVER...My bedroom faces this bar.  Is it absolutely necessary to be dumping glass bottles AFTER 2am most nights?  I think, as a good neighbor, since there are apartments behind you, I would hold off on this. 'Cause hell,  It's LOUD.  Is someone breaking into my apartment?, LOUD.  Love ya anyhoo.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"love this bar!  did you know they were building one up at desert ridge??? just drove by today and saw the sign and a building being worked on...AMAZING so fun and a great spot for it.  :)  Food is fun, service is good...great spot to watch games and they usually have some good drink specials so you're not about to break the bank when going there."}
{"text":"I went during the Iowa Football Homecoming game against Penn St. and the place was loaded with Iowa fans, in their hawk gear, into the game, and cheering on the team. I had $2 Bud Light bottles and $5 for a dozen wings and $5 plate of nachos. It's a hip place, spacious, and good atmosphere. I had a fun time for a good price.  I probably enjoyed this place a little more than your average guy, since I'm a University of Iowa alum, and this is an official Hawkeye bar."}
{"text":"I dont know...if youre just looking for a cheap Mexican inspired meal and a casual patio, its fine. I only give it 3 stars because the warm (thin but not too thin and litely salted) tortilla chips and green & red salsas were EXCELLENT!! Everything else was just ok. The quesadilla was ok, the coconut shrimp were ok, the grilled fish tacos were almost ok, the prickly pear margs were really sweet but ok. The service was ok. An excellent choice for ulyra casual watching sports or after playing sports (some of patio is actually covered in sand) - not great for a business hh with clients in high heels :-/"}
{"text":"Ordered drinks... it took almost 20 minutes to get them,  then she got it wrong and forgot one, it's hot and can't get anything around here, I go to the bar and the bartenders are so in a bad mood that it makes me fell that I have to be nice to them,  they don't even smile and look at me when they ask you what kind of a drink I need, $120 at night, will not be back at t j is cheap joint,  this people need CD training, and it's expensive and forced to tip? SMH"}
{"text":"We came out here to eat lunch since it was such a nice day. We brought some food from 8 Noodle Bar and our waitress didn't mind which was thoughtful of her. I just got their virgin strawberry mojito. It was good, it was just hard to drink, the big clumps of strawberries would block off the straw. They need the mince the strawberries smaller. I also tried some of the quesadilla that my Aunt ordered. It was really rich, heavy and kinda oily. So overall just an ok place."}
{"text":"Awesome poolside bar located inside RR. Gorgeous servers and tasty drinks. Have yet to try the food but I'm usually there to swim & drink lol. Great for meeting up with friends, people watching or just working on your tan with a ice cold beverage. Chill vibe, which I like. Always a fun experience here.   A Must Try: The Piña Colada served inside a pineapple, doesn't get more summertime than that! #instagramworthy"}
{"text":"I just want to start this review out by saying if you think wearing heels to the Sandbar is a good idea, you are f'ing retarded.. And yet, I see the same hoes wearing the same hoe-y heels and complaining that they cant walk and that the sand in between their toes is disgusting. God people are irritating.   I don't love this place. In fact, I don't even really like this place. I feel like everyone who goes there has a giant stick up their ass, stares at you like you have 10 goddamn heads and the dudes.. don't even get me started on the dudes. Lets just say douche to the bag. But pluralized. 500 times.  I once cut my foot open on an enormous shard of glass that was peeking out of the sand because I was dumb enough to think it was a good idea to empty my shoe out and step on the ground. Don't do this. Don't even take your shoe off ever. Also, don't get in that water. I swear a layer of syphilis was floating on the top of it last time I was there. I think a decent rake job on their pseudo beach is a must after every shift.. and perhaps some chlorine, or better yet...  bleach. Seriously, think about it.  The one cool thing that ever happened at the Sandbar in the handful of times i've been forced to come here was that a dude bought 100 beers. He bought ONE HUNDRED BEERS and passed them out to whoever was close. I think I walked away with 3, and who the hell doesn't love free beer. Other than that, this place is enormous and confusing and dirty and there are random shards of glass and STD's floating around everywhere.   Sorry dudes, im just, not a fan."}
{"text":"Came here twice out of convenience.  The first time I ordered the ceviche (3/5) and ahi tuna app (1/5).  It was probably the worst ahi tuna I've ever had.  I could see how they tried making it exciting with the flavors they chose but everything felt like a war zone in my mouth... not a good blend at all!  The ceviche was typical, nothing to rave about.  The second time I had the fish tacos and a few pineapple express drinks.  This time around the food tasted MUCH better and the drinks were pretty tasty also.  Yes, the cost is pretty damn high, which is really frustrating since this is your only option to eat around the pool.  If they changed their policy to allow outside food, I would have bumped this to 3 stars.  Instead, I'm taking a star off purely because of GREED."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like a train wreck.  One between a train full of Jersey Shore castoffs and a train full of Paris Hilton wannabes.  Just stay away."}
{"text":"All I'm gonna say is that I HATE THE SANDBAR.  I really do, probably  for personal reasons:  I am always dragged there by the dumbest, most immature people I know and sand sucks unless you are actually at the beach.  If you must go, fine, but just don't ask me to go with you.   I'm glad I got that off my chest.    In their defense, I have never had their food.  So, that could be great and I could be missing out... but, I doubt it."}
{"text":"Ladies and Drag Queens beware, the \"sandbar\" actually has sand outside. Not very friendly to those trying to impress in heels. I work very close to the Sandbar on friday nights after work alot (10-15) of people from my work go there. I have been there quite a few times but not somewhere I would encourage someone to go. I have had some of the food, minichimis are ok, tasty when you are drunk but it's no substitute for Jack in The Box tacos at 2 in the morning.  There are a lot of great options for happy hour this just ins't one of them."}
{"text":"Pool area and service was just ok. Not bad but not great. Odd feeling and a somewhat lack of emotion in the staff. Drinks were strong so that was a plus"}
{"text":"Ugh I can't stand this place. The only reason it gets two stars is because I can walk there and it's an okay place to day drink and eat some chips and salsa.  On Cinco de Mayo, they block of the parking lot and fill it with sand and then you have to wait 30 minutes to get in.  And then pay.    Friday and Saturday nights are lame-o.  Guys have to pay $5.00.  If you're in heels, forget walking in the sand.  The dance floor fills with a bunch of drunks around midnight.  The crowd is definitely not \"Scottsdale\", but it's something.....more like skater boy meets Affliction meets arm band tattoos.  And that's just the guys.    I've just spend a few too many nights here either with friends that actually like it or as a last resort so we can stumble home....and haven't had a good time, EVER."}
{"text":"I am loving Sand Bar these days.  ALL beers are $2.50 during happy hour.  Nice chill scene for happy hour any night of the week."}
{"text":"If you visit the Sandbar and you are not a Scottsdale local you will be convinced that breast implants are a requirement for working there. Every bartender/waitress seemed to have implants. To add to that, across me ther was a young girl having the following conversation with some cougar:   Young Girl: Yeah, my doctor was awesome. Cougar: Oh yeah? Young girl: yeah, he made them completely natural Cougar: oh..... Young Girl: You should totally get some... Cougar: yeah, I've thought about... Young Girl: here, let me give you his card  So in other words... if you like breast implants visit the Sandbar. As far as the food...who knows, who cares?"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. The food is not only less than impressive but made me sick. They charge 18% auto-gratuity for service that was at best so-so. Disgusting!! Save your money and eat elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"What shoes should I wear? Seriously I am going out so I can't wear sneakers or sandals but I don't want sand on my nice shoes. What to do.  First off I have never eaten the food here. I usually come to hang out with friends and have drinks.    First who has a outdoor patio in AZ with out mist and big fans?  The beers and other drinks are a bit pricey.  After 10 there is a cash only cover charge so they can evade paying tax on it.  In general nothing great at all."}
{"text":"So disappointing.  Been there at least 10 times before with a good experience, but after tonight....we won't be back.  Ordered a chicken burrito sans onion....full of onion so my onion-allergy husband was unable to eat his entree.  Ordered nachos without sour cream....coated with sour cream beneath the cheese.  Pushed those aside.  Calimari was fine as were the drinks.  Server very pleasant.  When we pointed out the food issues she was great in apologizing, but that was it.  No re-do offered; nothing taken off the bill, lesson learned. Important to add, we were 2 of about  6 customers in the place.  Can't chalk the food up to a busy night. Adios."}
{"text":"I came here on a scorching Vegas afternoon to enjoy some pool time. I ordered a strawberry margarita and then a frozen mule later. Both were delicious, and although didn't seem that strong, they hit the spot on a hot day spent in the pool. The only downside was that the  bartenders were a bit slow to take my order both times. They were busy that day but it was just surprising because there were about 4 of them behind the counter. I'm not sure why it took so long for someone to even acknowledge me but it wasn't that big of a deal. All in all, very cool place to get a drink and chill by the pool. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the valley!  Mostly because it is next door to where I live but have ALWAYS had a good time here.  Some people in the Scottsdale/Chandler area do not like it because it is not exactly the \"Scottsdale\" crowd, much more laid back. You don't have to dress up in heels to go either, flip flops are fine on Friday and Saturday nights.  But if you are in heels, beware of actual sand outside. Bartenders are always friendly, just a good place to chill with friends.  Also, the Baja fish tacos are awesome here!  The nachos are ok too.  They also show UFC fights each month and a fun place to watch football on the weekends."}
{"text":"They're getting better at separating bills and not having mysterious drinks appear on your own tab.  if Jasmine didn't work there, i'd have no reason to go to this location anymore.  i was told to stop giving hot chicks piggy back rides. seriously?  no redbull? wtf!?!?!"}
{"text":"Other than the sand angle, definitely just an average bar.  The drinks are okay, the service was average.  Definitely caters to a younger crowd, although the crowd was mixed the last 2 times we were there.  Have never eaten there.  The music is definitely geared to 20 sometimes, although not as bad as the techno pseudo music played at some other clubs.  Will definitely go back, not because of the club, but because of the location."}
{"text":"I mean no cover and its not bad...however..be aware that there is ACTUAL sand there...i had a little too much to drink and apparently didn't notice..however when I saw my shoes the other day...they looked like somebody blew a huge load of angel dust everywhere"}
{"text":"Been to the Sandbar bar a few times and the bartender Brad is very good at his job! He is engaging, friendly and his service is top notch. He makes a killer Long Island iced tea and even remember what my wife and I were drinking the second time we came. I recommend you see him if you want fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I cannot fathom why somebody +21 would go here other than the cruel initiation of a Community College Rugby hazing or you are someone who thinks some chick from Mountain View will check out your onions if you buy her a couple of screwdrivers."}
{"text":"I tried going here to use my Groupon earlier this week but they were closed for renovation. They're changing their name too. Bummer - I wish they updated their web site that they would be closed."}
{"text":"Happy hour sausagefest apres 6 pm weekdays. There must have been 30 guys and maybe 5 chicks on two different occasions. Whoa! I like the specials and love the Malibu accessories spread across the walls. Way to get my attention!!"}
{"text":"like the \"bro\" scene? you'll love it here. i was hoping for more than the typical scottsdale meat market, but was sorely disappointed. drink service was slow, bartender poured weak cocktails, and the whole experience was below average. to top it off, it seemed as though every man in the place considered a woman's presence there a free pass to to touch her back, hip or butt as they walked past. if i don't know you, please don't touch me. the bathroom was ridiculously small and dirty. overall the sandbar was disgusting, overrated and so far, the worst meat market of them all."}
{"text":"The sandbar is a pretty nice bar, overall.  It's huge, with great music and good people!  I went here for my birthday and had a blast.  The location is kind of weird; it's in a shopping center.  Being from CA, I'm not used to this!  The ONE thing is, don't rub up against the wall of the dance floor...  it cut my back and I was bleeding for 4 days!  But maybe that was more alcohol induced than anything else.   I agree with  the other reviews: don't wear heels - there is actual sand here people! I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for some good dancing and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else (so far), I am leaving a review for a concert I attended here, not because I stayed at Red Rock Casino and went to the pool for food/drinks.   I actually did not eat or drink anything while at my show (Lauryn Hill, formerly of The Fugees, formerly a sane human being), but I was offered marijuana by a fellow concert-goer.   It is a relatively strange concert venue. As it's been noted, the assigned seating chairs are closest to the stage, and the rest of the remaining venue is GA/SRO/FLOOR. Would it be better use of the facility to have it all GA? Of course. Could they set up some risers for those 'special' people that cannot handle GA? Definitely.   In other words, is it unnecessarily cramped, especially considering the prices that they charge for tickets, and the fact that other poolside venues do it with tons of clear lines-of-sight? That's for you to decide if you go to a show here. It is just an 'A-OK' venue even though the L-Boogie set was tremendous, although I cannot recall if this was the one where she fell onstage or not. Too many Hill stage mishaps to keep track of without a dedicated chart. - E"}
{"text":"Sandbar is like a slightly more affordable, less dressed-up Devil's North. They literally have sand on the outside patio, so in the warm months you can rock sandals and feel the [artificial] sand between your toes as you sip your beer. Not too shabby.  In general, I have been pretty happy with the crowds at this location, as well. The less dressed up vibe blurs the lines of who has how much money and even the music is more accessible.   Of the North Scottsdale scene, Sandbar is my standout favorite . . . if I have a ride. I have found myself on more than a couple of occassions stranded at three in the morning in search of a taxi cab on Scottsdale road."}
{"text":"The concerts by the Pool at Red Rock are great!   Gorgeous setting, sounds is good and it has an intimate concert feel unlike a large venue.   I expected the weather to be hot but it has been perfect every night. The light breeze and surrounding pools drop the temp down to just right for a summer night in Vegas.   Dress comfortable and you can even dip your feet in the water if you want to.  3 concerts there so far and I plan on going to a few more before summer ends."}
{"text":"Went to the Sandbar grill at Red Rock Hotel & Casino since we had a $30 food credit there during our stay.  This place was not that great for a takeout meal!  But at least the servers were in bikinis.  The grill is short on customer service.  I sat at an empty table near the bar and had the menu in my hand ready to place a to go order for back in our room.  Waited 10 minutes with no response from anyone working!  Had to move to the actual Sandbar 'bar' to get someone to help me.  Placed my order for a Pool Burger and a Turkey Club.  Then proceeded to wait even LONGER.  I was at the bar for another good 30 minutes!  They were so unorganized with food tickets!  Luckily one of the ladies working politely asked me if I was still waiting for food.  Literally less than two minutes later my order arrived.  Packed, ready to go, I just had to sign the order to my room.  The bill?  $39!!  Holy schnikes!  Turns out a Pool Burger is $16, a damn Turkey Club is $15, then you add tax, and an AUTOMATIC 18% gratuity!  Ridiculous!  Poof went the food credit and then some.  I thought this food better be good.  Got back up to the room and did the unboxing.  Food looked pretty MEH to me.  Like a burger.  And a club sandwich.  My damn turkey club wasn't even cut in four triangles with a toothpick in each one like it should be!  My damn turkey club didn't even come with fries!  Argh!  Silly.  Even worse, the turkey club was bone dry!  No mayo!  And no packets of it in my bag.  My kid liked the pool burger with cheese, but again dry!  No mayo or mustard or ketchup on top.  If you guys are gonna do this, why not include some condiments in my bag?  Being on the 16th floor I sure didn't feel like going back down to get some.  But at least her burger came with FRIES.  But I mean, who doesn't include some damn ketchup if there's fries??  Total pisser.  Mediocre overall, and I still had to foot $9 after the food credit!  Shame, shame.  I could have cooked this stuff myself better at home.  The +1 star is for the pretty girls in their teeny bikinis, they workout!  But I don't think many of them can even really swim.  They must also be used as a distraction by the pool for fooling customers into thinking that their Sandbar grill food is the best thing since suntan lotion.  Touché Red Rock, touché."}
{"text":"Got a primo shaded spot by the pool and didn't want to leave so we ordered a kid friendly lunch from the bikini clad server:  Hummus - yummy and came with nice variety of veggies, olives and pita. Chicken quesadilla - tasty with guacamole, sour cream and salsa Chicken nuggets- flavorful came with carrots, celery, mustard and ranch Total: $50 with tax and tip.   Kiddos ended up eating all of the hummus, few bites of quesadilla and hardly any of the chicken nuggets...go figure. Adults enjoyed the meal and cleaned it off. Overall surprisingly better than what I imagined."}
{"text":"I've been to Sandbar several times, but never ordered food. They have happy hour appetizer specials from 3 to 7 p.m. daily, so my boyfriend and I ordered the calamari and quesadilla, sans meat ($5 each).  Both were surprisingly good for the price. The pinnacle was the spicy mango and chipotle pineapple margaritas ($4). Also discounted during happy hour, they were drinkable and sweet with a tinge of spiciness. (Try it - you'll see). Apparently all alcohol, except for specialty drinks, is half off during happy hour.  Live music added to the experience. I would definitely come back.  I do recommend they clean their pool, however. It was starting to look green."}
{"text":"Wouldn't disagree with the negative reviews about this place. But bottom line, I always have a good time here. I have not tried their food."}
{"text":"Great lunch! Broccoli salad with perfectly poached chicken breast. Broccoli salad had a peanut dressing and fantastic grilled broccoli. Not too heavy in the hot sun but about a 6-7 ounce breast of chicken. Chicken Caesar salad also terrific. Kid said the burger was great - served on a brioche bun. She said it was juicy and delicious. Service was friendly and prompt. This is a great poolside restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok Sand Bar I'm kinda boycotting. When there's a concert going on - getting drinks is like pulling teeth. There's so many people and some of the bartenders there do not know what the hell they're doing. So if you go get a drink.....be prepared to wait in line for a while. Unless they've gotten their shit together. Personally I don't think the setup is that smart. The bar is off to the side - so while you're waiting in line there's obstructions of trees and stuff in your way so you can hear a concert and not see it. At least put some video screens of the dude singing right?"}
{"text":"09/16/11 TEARS FOR FEARS CONCERT.  After attending thousands of concerts, this has to be one of the most miserable venues I've ever encountered for a show. If I could give it a zero, I would.  First off, WHERE did the advertisements state that there were SEATED vs STANDING tickets available? They cordoned off a section directly in front of the stage, and then surrounded it with security goons. The light board was literally where it shouldn't be, in the middle directly across from the stage, but COMPLETELY BEHIND the SEATED section, so that the poor folks who couldn't get into the SEATED section (which, BTW, was ONLY HALF FULL the entire evening) were stuck trying to negotiate ANY remaining sight lines.  And then, when it comes to getting ANYTHING to drink, forget about it. There were bars, but it was virtually impossible to walk around, due to all the pools in the way. I'm very surprised no one fell in, considering how DRUNK and OBNOXIOUS the crowd was, and the little amount of room to wander. I did not drink a thing the entire show, from 9pm until just after 11.  And about that crowd. OMFG, WHY DO YOU GO TO CONCERTS AND THEN SCREAM AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS TO FRIENDS WHILE THE SHOW IS HAPPENING? WHY THE F**K ARE YOU EVEN THERE? Now, as I said at the beginning, I've literally been to thousands of shows, and have experienced this many times. But THIS CROWD takes the cake for obnoxiousness. I nearly encountered a fist fight between a group of drunks directly next to me, caused by an a**hole couple who shoved in front of 2 nice folks who had been standing next to me for the first 45 mintues, which, if it had not been diffused, would've ended up, in a domino effect, getting my spouse thrown into a pool, and then, believe me, DEATH BY SPOUSE would have occurred!  And then there were the actual people WORKING the venue. NONE of them seemed to want to be there. (DO YOU BLAME THEM?) And there were \"thugs\" literally shoving people out of the way to escort \"special\" people to the SEATED section. Again, I'm surprised no one ended up in one of the pools. (I overheard someone say, in fact, \"Gee, NO ONE ended up in a pool this time!\")  So my advice is: If there is a show advertised for this venue, DO NOT GO unless you can get those SEATED tickets. It just isn't fun enough to deal with. And even THEN, expect overcrowding, chaos and a**holes, both w/ mgmt and patrons.  I moved to Vegas last December. I've enjoyed EVERYWHERE tremendously. I am a Strip patron and a non-Strip patron. The free concerts at the Cosmopolitan, the shows at the punk venues like Double Down and Beauty Bar, even the shows at the Railhead inside the Boulder Station, have all been pleasant, well-staffed and easy to have fun. This was the first time in 9 months of being a local where I started thinking maybe I made a mistake moving here.  Next show: Joy Formidable @ the Cosmopolitan Pool. Can't wait. Saw them Thursday night there. And I've been there already for a bunch of shows."}
{"text":"20 TVs and a full on guacamole spread.  If you're here for spring training and need a break from socializing at the mall (I kid you not, they party at Fashion Square Mall here), come to a place where you can dip your toes in groddy kiddie pool water.  If you're lucky you'll get the waitress with Asian guy fetish so its well worth the $180 that United charges you"}
{"text":"I know several people personal at the Peoria Sandbar and try to get over there as often as I can, with the Scottsdale location being closer to my house a group of friends and I decided to party at the Scottsdale location for New Year's Eve this year.   Overall we had a great time. The theme of the evening was Paparazzi. They had a red carpet outside with a photog, disposable cameras on the table for everyone to document the evening, and crazy drink specials. I choose to partake in the Champagne Bucket special, $20 for 4 mini bottles, which I bough two of. Probably should have rethought that one, as the next day I hurt, but who didn't?   Things I didn't like.... the dance floor was crazy packed, the line for the bathroom was out of control (but there isn't really any helping that, don't go pee? lol) and some of the female bartenders had a difficult time serving me, it was as if I was completely invisible to them at times. I finally caught on to this and walked to the other side of the bar and they guys took way better care of me.   We had fun, I would recommend partying here. I haven't had the food in a long time so I cannot speak on that aspect at this time."}
{"text":"The good news is that they have Negra Modelo at 2 for $2.50 at Happy Hour, which has to be some kind of Scottsdale record.  The bad news is that it's a Mexican restaurant that seems to want to be a titty bar when it grows up.   The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that every girl working here has implants.  Big humongous ones.  Not that there's anything wrong with that but it did confuse me on the concept somewhat. Friendly servers though.  The food - at least what I had - was barely edible.  Stick to the $1.25 beers."}
{"text":"One star because this place, during summer and during happy hour, could be tolerable for a very short time, other than that ----- Run Away!!!  The have the worst music mix on a Friday night.  It's ghetto-fabulous rap and crappy Bon Jovi (the entire place raised their fists and mouthed the lyrics to Living on a Prayer I swear).    $9 mixed drinks taste sooooooo much better, I feel like such a winner paying 3 x regular price of a regular drink.  $ 4 Coronas.  I saw a drunk chick fall into the little pool thingy, nice.   One out of two had fake breasts.   Seriously, I counted.  I entertained myself by watching the ladies in 3-4\" heels sink into the sand, and their dates never never offered an arm to steady themselves they just watched them sink. Classy.  What Scottsdale stereotype's? ----------Yeah right."}
{"text":"One of Las Vegas's newest hot spots - the Red Rock Casino Resort Spa.  This review is based on their Sand Bar and the entertainment events they host by the pool.  Arriving into the desert was \"A Tribe Called Quest.\"  The setting, a huge outdoor pool with giant beds for outdoor lounging.  If you hope to score one of these beds to enjoy your concert experience, expect to get there early.  They are definitely hard to come by.    With alcohol sold poolside, you can still bring your previously purchased drinks into the concert area.  (They'll pour your drink into a plastic cup, that's all.)  A stage is put up for the performing artists and with its general admission, feel free to get up close and personal by making your way to the front.  If you arrive too late, plan on spending time in the way back.  With the pool being right in the middle of the venue, your only options are the front, sides or way back.    With it being September and with the headliners hitting the stage at 9 pm, it wasn't too hot outside.    Overall, Red Rock Casino Resort Spa is a pretty cool place.  Locals and tourists frequent the place as it's off the strip and not readily accessible to those who don't know about it."}
{"text":"Sandbar gives us North Scottsdalers another chance at a casual bar on our side of town!  Located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, Sandbar has a pretty convenient location and is usually a fun spot to go out dancing and drinking.  The DJ is either hit or miss; sometimes he plays awesome music and everyone's on the dance floor and other times the dance floor is completely empty because the music ain't so great.  I've always wondered if anyone has become so intoxicated while at Sandbar that they have fallen into the little pond outside. Unfortunately, I have never seen this happen. But I have woken up in the morning with a Sandbar server schedule in my pocket with no recollection as to why. My friend was dancing so crazy one night on one of the platforms, that when she jumped off, she sprained her ankle.  See? Sandbar's a really good time. Oh and if you get hungry, there's a little hot dog cart out front, so you can eat a wiener, drink and be merry."}
{"text":"So this is gonna be one of 'those' reviews.  Yes, Iam a hater.   Granted, The Sandbar isn't a true Scottsdale club, at least to me, but what would I know, I likes the dive bars.   So, here's the story.  I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places. How this happens, I don't know. I guess Iam just that awesome.   Been dragged here twice, Iam not gonna count the 3rd time because that was more of a 'walked in thru the kitchens back door to get to the restrooms' type of visit.   The other 2 times I went there were not planned, but same basic experience each time.   The sandy beach out front is a hassle and I got tired of hearing those girls complaining about how difficult it is to walk thru, duh, its freakin' sand!  It took a while for the bartender to make the drinks, since she was the only one in the outside area.    As for inside, lots of MMA inspired shirts and camisoles with no bras, AKA super classy!  I suppose I chose a bad night, since whenever a UFC fight is on, its super packed with big strong guys watching big strong guys fight on TV, so my fault there.   In the end, I was bored out of my mind, but highly entertained with the group who was doing the \"Lean Like A Cholo\" dance while sitting in a booth.   So, 1 star, and that's being generous."}
{"text":"$1 Taco Tuesday produced some mighty tasty taco's, but the place was slow and lifeless. I love the concept of the outdoor beach, pool, and surfboard tables - walking around in the sand makes you feel like you're on vacation. The inside is huge, but feels like any other Mexican restaurant with a bar. Bring your friends and try this for happy hour, or late on the weekends - when it turns into more of a club."}
{"text":"Ordered food and drinks while hanging out at the pool. Plenty of servers walking around the pool area to serve you. Very convenient when you don't feel like leaving your spot poolside. Prices are high but to be expected from a casino eatery. The food was surprising pretty good. We got the turkey club and the jerk Chicken sandwich. Both came with a choice of French fries, sweet potato fries or fruit. Sweet potato fries were definitely a great choice.  Turkey club was big enough for 2! The jerk chicken had pretty good flavor as well. Pitcher of pineapple mojito was refreshing. They also had an off menu desert of dole whip!  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but definitely works for hangin by the pool"}
{"text":"How can you beat a bar by an awesome pool that makes you feel like you are on vacation?The food is average for pool food and the drinks are what you ask them to create.  However,  my biggest hang up here is the customer service. I have a keen sense and I could feel the tension, drama and chaos between the bartenders and even the servers.  They even complained about another bartender who they thought was faking an illness just to go home earlier. No one behind the bar made eye contact with the customers and I was there a good three hours people watching with my girlfriend.  Note-not all pool customers are creepers who want to get your digits and hang out with you later!! We were appalled by the immaturity. Given that my Hubs and I have a season pool pass, we will come back. I only hope it gets better, not worse."}
{"text":"Went here for the Weezer concert.  The venue is very interesting as it has many pools but you cannot go swimming during the show.  We got there early and got a prime spot by the stage.  We suggest getting there on the early side as you do not want to get trapped by the pools and accidentally fall in. There were plenty of drink specials but I could not believe they charged $3 for an 12oz bottle of their own water!  Also be careful of beer bottles that people drop.  They are aluminum, but they are hard and you could roll an ankle on them.   Overall it was a nice venue for a concert and would go back if they had an act I wanted to see :0"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here. The servers are a bit busy running food and drinks all over the pool complex, but they were friendly and kitchen service was fast. I had the coconut shrimp app which was amazing and the street chicken tacos. I dumped those 3 mini tacos out of their double taco shell wrap and made myself more of a taco salad. It was very good. There are seats in and out of the sun and quite a few with umbrellas if you sit in the restaurant area and not out just by the pool. There were a few game table in the area but they were not open at the time. No indoor seats here."}
{"text":"Our bachelorette party group had a fantastic time at the Sand Bar in our signature cabanas. The pool manager John did an awesome job ensuring our group was accommodated. All of the girls who worked in the front and passed out towels were super sweet and courteous as well. We appreciate the great service our group received and will recommend the Sand Bar to our friends and family. Thank you Red Rock!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a decent sports bar, so I met my husband and some friends here for lunch on the Friday of the first round of the NCAA tournament. We were the only table of people inside and there were maybe 10 other people in the entire place. Including an handful of old (50+) men that hugged all of the waitresses WAY too long. They lingered. Anyway, our server was awful. I've been a server at different points in my life, and I have no problem calling out the ones that suck. She was worthless. No one got water more than once and the drinks sat empty for 15-20 minutes at time.  The food was pathetic. I'm 6.5 months pregnant and will eat just about anything you put in front of me...but I didn't want to eat any of the tacos I ordered. $12 for three TINY tacos that had zero meat on the inside and what little food there was in them tasted like crud. Also, apparently the dish comes with rice and beans...which come on their own gigantic plate. Since no one ate theirs, because it was so bad, the plates of rice and beans sat there the entire time we were there. Even after our other plates were cleared, the freaking beans and rice would not go away. She just kept leaving them there, apparently in case we got some cravings for black beans with beers, after the beans had been sitting there for half an hour. After waiting for 20 minutes or so just to see our server to get our check, we finally just went to the bar to pay. When our server returned with our cards, she apologized that she wasn't around. She said she'd told her boss that she felt like she was getting sick and thought he was going to take care of the check. Super glad this one was serving us drinks and food all afternoon, especially to a pregnant chick, if she feels like crap. That was the first and last time I'll ever go there. Way too many great places in this area to get great food from servers who aren't going to give you herpes. Which is what I'm 99% sure she was coming down with."}
{"text":"Loved that their were plenty of servers to keep the beverages a comin'!  Kara was spot on with her drink recommendations and she was a true mixologist!!  Her loaded berry lemonade, Barbados punch and purple hooters were a must try.  Liked the atmosphere...good music and poolside.  Disliked...nothing!"}
{"text":"There is sand at the Sandbar underneath some of the tables.  It gives it a beach type of feel on the outside.  I did feel like coming from the beach because I had a precarious event happen right before.  I was at a pool party, and I was wearing casual clothes because I knew I was going to join a birthday party right after at Sandbar.  I was about to leave, and one of the girls was really drunk and said that I had to be in the pool.  Her and her friend literally double teamed me and started to take off my shoes, socks, and important articles.  I started to get a cramp, so I resisted the fight.  I got thrown in the pool with my clothes on!  Luckily, it was an AZ summer night of 100 degrees and I would dry off right away.  When I entered Sandbar, I felt like I was in the right place because of what just happened.  It was a very casual atmosphere, very much many AZ bars.  Near the entrance, they had a cute girl giving out shots and beers.  Once every hour or so, they would announce some drinks specials to order from her.  Drinks in general were about standard prices.  I got some beer, so I can't comment on any mixed drinks.  There was a medium size dance floor on the inside.  I like the fact Sandbar gives a casual beach vibe, but you can still rock it out on the dance floor inside.  Overall, it was a fun experience to a crazy night, and I can see myself out here again.  Hopefully this time I am not soaking wet!"}
{"text":"Nice looking bar & grill adjacent to the pool! I've hung out here after being at the Cabana Club pool and already had a drink. After reading the reviews here, I'm fearful to attempt to get one at Sandbar! The servers/bartenders I encountered here seemed only marginally irritated. There were a few I didn't interact yet with.   Hey Red Rock, if you have a venue that allegedly provides crap service, FOR THE SAKE OF SANITY REPEAL THE AUTO GRATUITY. Is Light Group running this place??? I do, however, often fill up on the free water available to all at the bar. There have been plenty of tables available the last few times and even seats at the bar. Those patrons at the bar seemed to having a good time. The draft beer selection is decent.  For convenience's sake, you may have to throw caution to the wind and enjoy a meal & bevvie here when hunger strikes!"}
{"text":"Only eaten here once or twice and it was so-so.  I really come here for the dancing and drinking!  I've never had a bad time here.  There's definitely something for everyone here.  You can sit in a booth or at the bar inside OR you can go outside.  They have it like a beachy bar.  There's a bar, cabanas and tables/chairs in the sand!  They also have a little water pool area thing that you can walk in and get your feet wet.  There are always interesting and fun people here and it's a great place to meet someone new.  I like to take my out of town friends here.  It's so different!"}
