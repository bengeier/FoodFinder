{"text":"Terrible food. We ordered the asian salad and chicken poutine and it simply wasnt good at all. The chicken is too dry and the sauce wont compensate for that. The added mushroom and sauteed onions were bad and the dressing tasted weird."}
{"text":"They started strong and have become lazy and gross. Today I went in for a takeout sandwich and watched an employee drop a cup full of change and bills onto a surface they were preparing food on, without wiping down when finished. Then they put a customers \"sandwich paper\" down right there and wrapped it up, cross contaminating the prep person's gloves and every lunch after that.  My food was for takeout, very sloppily half wrapped in foil, and completely cold on arrival.   As I said I really liked this place when It opened but training and standards have gone entirely.  Spend your money someplace where they care, definitely not here."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! LYING INCLUDED!  Called them for delivery of a club sandwich... 40 minutes later I called them back. The new owner told me my food had left 10 minutes ago, satisfied with his answer I waited an extra 20 minutes. After which I called again and asked where my food was, they then realized they never entered an order for my food... Owner take notes, lying to your customers will never work out in the long term. Never going back and making sure no one I know does."}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the quality vs. price. The place is very clean, the staff are friendly and the food came out quickly. The bbq was really flavourful. I will definitely go back to try the gyro when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went back a second time. Food came out cold. Meat on my sandwich was stringy and flavorless, made almost exclusively of fat.  The staff was distracted and inattentive and just seemed bored.  I left hungry and angry and $27 poorer."}
{"text":"Best rotisserie chicken I ever had. It was so juicy and fresh I didn't even need to use gravy. The staff was welcoming and friendly. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Wonderful beef ribs, good service. What the heck more do you want? There are very few places in Montreal where you can get really good beef ribs. Well, this is one. And the roasted potatoes are great!"}
{"text":"This was great place for rotisserie chicken? What happened went recently and it was closed. Anyone know if they are reopening?"}
{"text":"This place can be a really, really decent place for take-out. The fries CAN be amazing--we're talking best in the hood, better than AAs. The chicken can be deliiiiiicious. Even the bread's not bad.  But dammit, this place does not know how to keep it consistent! I come here once a month, sometimes more often (if the last time went well.) It's always a crapshoot. I've been here when the waitresses have been in a great mood, the kitchen staff has been on fire, and walked away with an extra chicken breast, the best damn fries in Saint-Henri, and a nice little piece of bread.  On the other hand... I've walked away (many times!) with burnt, skimpy chicken; cold, limp fries; old brown coleslaw; and a non-existent (forgotten) loaf of bread.  Basically: if the manager is here (old dude), the food is GREAT! If the staff is left by themselves (kinda sketchy looking, super pierced and tatted up--not a problem, but expect that) the food blows chunks. Sorry BBQ Sud-Ouest!"}
{"text":"My Po-Bo sandwich was fine. I know this is Canada but the portion sizes are still very small for the price."}
{"text":"Stay away it's gross. I went there with my friend last summer and it was okay this time it was terrible. Club sandwich is shredded shitty meat. Poutine had 4 pieces of cheese and we actually ordered 2 salads before we were stuck with the poutine and club but they called back 20 minutes later to say they didn't have. Cold food and not good I don't know how they are still open"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in St Henri. I've come to the restaurant and ordered in at least a dozen times. This is the place to go to for high quality rotisserie chicken. The prices cannot be beat for the quantity and quality of food. My go to for a cheap but healthy meal to order in. On a cheat night, the beer selection is always appealing."}
{"text":"Je suis venu dans ce restaurant sans vraiment chercher sur Yelp une fois avoir commandé j'ai regardé et j'étais surpris par les commentaires négatifs pour ma part injustifié lors de ma visite, je recommande le sandwich gyro très bon et les frites sont très bonnes !"}
{"text":"I used to go here almost every week last year because it was quite delicious for the price plus it was close to my house. The service was always prompt and nice. Well, I tried it today after a long break and I was really dissapointed. The prices went up. The quality of both food and service went down. Now it's a totaly different ratio. The chicken leg was undercooked. It was also tiny. They used to serve it with corn. Not anymore. Now they charge extra dollar for roasted potatios instead of fries. Didn't even asked me what I prefer. Plus other little details I don't even want to mention. Too bad..."}
{"text":"LIES TO CUSTOMERS!! I call and ask if they will deliver to me on Parc Avenue and they say yes. Then an hour later they call and say they won't come. Unbelievable. Will never be back for more. Very unhappy"}
{"text":"Rage de poule près du métro Atwater. Le genre de rage de poule à laquelle il est impossible de résister.   Le décor est particulier, le genre de décor que tu aurais cru plus beau vu de l'extérieur. La terrasse est jolie.  Le service est sympathique mais un peu long. Le serveur fait des petites blagues et ça me fait semi-rire parce que j'ai fait et JE VEUX DE LA POULE VITE.  Le plat, maintenant. J'ai commandé deux cuisses avec accompagnements. Les cuisses étaient vraiment bien, tendres avec la peau crunchy. Les frites: what the hell?!? Ca goûte drôle, le genre de drôle qui fait pas rire. Du sel jusqu'à la fin des temps, je me demande si j'ai encore des artères. Would not recommend les frites.  La sauce barbecue qui accompagne le tout est bonne. Le pain était moyen frais. La salade de chou? Pas goûté, il n'y avait plus de place dans mon belly.  En gros, c'est ok pour une rage de poule, mais disons que le fait de manger de la poule assise sur la Place des Festivals pas d'ustensiles avant un show était plus mémorable que l'assiette de poule elle-même."}
{"text":"Partner had a Po-Boy and 2 wings. I had a roast beef sandwich and a \"lemon pie\". The Good: They were true to their word with no nuked or frozen anything. The meat in the sandwiches was moist and tender. The buns were fresh. Once you got to the bottom of the coleslaw container it was actually quite good. My roast potatoes were ok (quite bland though) and partner's fries were good. The BBQ dipping sauce was quite nice. The Bad: The mushroom condiment was so peppery as to be off-putting. The onion condiment was relatively tasteless. All the other condiments were either too vinegary or peppers. Partner had to add quite a bit of Tabasco to the wings even though the hottest sauce was asked for. I asked for \"a little bit\" of sauce  but the counter-person slathered my bun with it. The coleslaw is served in pre-prepared plastic cups and, therefore, the top part was dry and flavourless. My roast potatoes really needed the BBQ dipping sauce to taste like much. The only dessert available was individually plastic boxed slices of a \"lemon pie\" with no meringue but a factory piped \"cream\" top that took me 3 forkfuls before I could taste any lemon flavour. Only water available is 1 type of bottled water. The Ugly: The 3rd thing they promise is no \"friture\". If french fries aren't fried then what are they? Seriously people; get it together.  Only 1 of the 3 staff seemed to know what was going on and that one didn't look like she cared. Also, she started preparing my partner's order before even taking mine (or acknowledging my presence) even though we standing at the counter side by side.  Except for 2 uncomfortable benches that are right in front of the ordering counter that can seat 5 at most, the other 25 seats in the place are all extra tall wooden chairs. For short folk like me it's a nightmare and the tall chairs tend to wobble if you are a person of size. There are hanging lamps right in front of the menu board that make it difficult to see, and the design of the place, in general, is a hot mess - way too crowded. The Downright Disastrous: The noise! The vent was on full blast right over the noisy refrigerator with both the radio and the TV going. (Why a TV way up in a corner in a 30 seat place? Is it for the staff?) Sitting near that vent was also a freezing experience I will never want to repeat. We could barely hear our own conversation. Great for getting people to leave quickly. And the name Rotisserie? For a busy Saturday night I saw 1(count 'em) sad looking little rotisserie chicken on the prep counter. All the other meat is in and under fancy cloche servers that I would expect to see at the Ritz. You cannot see the meat you are ordering. Not a good sign. I may give this place one more chance but I really doubt it with so many other excellent places to go for this type of cuisine and, especially for rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"****WARNING****  Below is my original review, which after today's experience  I was going to delete. I've kept it to show how good it can be. Today I decided to order, having had 2 exceptional experiences after the first visit which I said \"I'd never eat at that place again\" I've now returned to that opinion.  If you're going to sell beef ribs, they have to be good. If I wanted to gnaw chewy fatty garbage I wouldn't order them. Further dear restaurant operator, using \"the meat comes that way from the supplier\" as your excuse is a weak, stupid and disrespectful position. I would tell anyone who wants ribs, this isn't the place to get them, and the fact that they have such poor quality control (you might want to try tasting your food) suggests that they should perhaps choose another business.  Original review:  I am writing this review as I am still pleasantly surprised. It's my experience that over time restaurants get worse, not better. In late winter I first went to this place, and as much as I wanted to love it, the ribs were not good. I had pork ribs (my favourite) and they were dry.   Fast forward to now, and I decided tonight I wanted Ribs, and I would go to any length to get them. As long as it didn't require me leaving my apartment. So I took a chance and went back, where I had gone before.  Firstly, if you're in their hood, delivery is fricking lightning fast. I swear it was under 15 minutes from ordering to my door. Now the good part... ready... ok. Its 4:23am, I have a half a rack in my fridge, and as soon as I finish writing this, they'll be gone.  nuff said"}
{"text":"What happened?! This place was so good before... the quality of the food and service have really changed. :( I miss how it was like at the beginning!  Was there this 5 months ago, perhaps things are different now?"}
{"text":"BBQ is an art, Rotisserie Sud-West Bar-B-Que is no Picasso. They are more like renaissance fair artisans. Except what they do, they do REALLY well. The roast chicken tastes like pretty every roast chicken in Montreal without coming close to Chalet BBQ though, the KING of BBQ Chicken in Montreal but their chicken did not sit in a warmer all day and is juicy, tender and tastes like some top grade chicken. Same for the side slaw. Tastes almost exactly like St-Hubert's slaw but crisper, fresher, can't put my finger on it but it was BETTER. The ribs are tender, juicy, with a nice thick sauce. While they don't come near let's say Blackstrap BBQ, they are still pretty damn good. The fries are freakin' AWESOME and so is the BBQ sauce. Added bonus that no other BBQ place seems to do... CORN ON THE COB. All that was missing was Mac n' Cheese. Rotisserie Sud-West Bar-B-Que isn't innovating but they deliver quality BBQ grub in good quantity that should make their neighbor (New System Rotisserie) a bit nervous and will stick to your ribs, leaving you in a happy haze of BBQ intoxication. That's why it gets a 4 outta 5... Quality ingredients served fresh and while not reinventing the wheel, delivering on taste and satisfaction."}
{"text":"One of my buddy brought me here after work to try out that place. To be honest, I wouldn't imagine the food there was so good. You come in and order at the counter and the waiter will bring it to you ( if you dine in). So I decided to grab the Chicken breast which comes with coleslaw, French fries, bbq sauce. I expected to pay at least $15, the clerk tells me it's around $8.50 including my bottle of water. Once again big portion for a small price. Takes around less than 10 min and the waiter brings out our  foods outside on the terrace btw nice setting for the terrace. 1 word: AMAZING! They just beat St-Hubert lol. I will  definitely  come back to try their ribs, hamburgers and more lol."}
{"text":"The last time I came here, it was great. Delicious food, great service. The waitress was really friendly and helpful and came to check on us since it was our first time in. You could tell everything was fresh. This second time, ugh. Different people this time--inattentive, disinterested. The food came out lukewarm at best (seemed to be a mix of watery and cold slaw and bun and lukewarm meat), and it was completely cold within minutes. When I took a bite of the po'boy (same thing I got last time), a whole mess of grease or whatever dripped out, which was nasty and made the other half of the sandwich soggy. Nowhere near as good as the first time, and I don't know which experience is more typical. It's a shame because I really enjoyed my first visit, but there's no way I'm going back on a 50/50 chance it'll be good."}
{"text":"This place was once amazing but now nothing but disappointing.   Both the food quality and service is terrible right now. Strictly recommend not to walk into this place."}
