{"text":"Went here with my Mum today for lunch today as both her house & my new office is nearby and we wanted to catch up.

The space, which is in the Hotel Blackfoot, is airy, clean and bright, with a combination of tables and booths. It's nothing spectacular or ground breaking, it's the perfect place for a quiet lunch with a relative or business acquaintance. 

The service was good and efficient - the servers were fast, friendly and helpful.

What blew us away was the menu. Gone is the buffet that apparently used to be here; now there is a regular menu & a specials menu at lunch time. 

The dishes ranged from a Mediterranean flatbread with pesto and goat cheese, to Irish Lamb Stew, to Glass Noodle Thai Salad. There was at least half a dozen things that sounded delectable to me - and all at decent prices (everything but the steaks was under $20). 

And when the food came, we were also impressed that what had sounded so good also looked so good - our meals were beautifully plated, with the ingredients decoratively arranged and herb garnishes perfectly applied. 

We had ordered the glass noodle salad & the Irish lamb stew; both came in good sized portions, tasted good, and left us full. While neither dish was absolutely amazing, they were good and tasty, with a good balance of ingredients and flavoring.

The bill was also a good price; under $35 (including tax) for two mains and a round of coffee each.

We got exactly what we had wanted when we chose to go here - a good meal for a good price, in an environment that was just perfect for a good in-depth talk. 

We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch this past weekend and it was very busy. It looked to me like there was a conference going on and everyone at the conference was eating lunch here. 
It took a few minutes to even get seated. After we were seated it took another 5 min. or so for someone to bring is a drink and take our order.
I ordered a clubhouse with fries, my son ordered a beef dip, my other son a pizza, and my wife a flatbread pizza.
It took over a half hour to get our food. We were going to ask what was taking so long, but no one came by. At this point the restaurant itself was starting to clear out. I thought the kitchen must be caught up by now. Three of our meals finally came out, with my wife having to wait a few more minutes for hers. 
The food itself wasn't anything special. The pizza was almost the type you would get from the frozen food section of your local grocery store. The beef dip was okay (tasted a bit of my son's). My clubhouse was okay the fries and sandwich were lukewarm, but the plate was hot. I understood this to be an indication of the food sitting under a heat lamp. Now that I think of it all the plates were warm to the touch. My wife's flatbread pizza, wasn't served on flatbread.
I'd have to say that I was a little disappointed in the food I ate here today. It to me tasted no different then food from an average cafeteria.
I won't be back anytime soon. At least for the lunch.  It looks like they may have a buffet here as well. Maybe down the road i'll give that a shot."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch.  The food was good but there was not much selection on vegetables and buns.  The crab legs were delicious.  We did not make a reservation so they did not allow us to sit in near the windows.  I had called prior to arriving and they said it was not busy not to make a reservation.  Eventhough the area was not busy they would not allow us to sit in the section"}
{"text":"Since we had plans to attend comedy club here on a Friday night, we decided to continue the buffet trend by going to the dinner buffet at Hotel Blackfoot.

Atmosphere:  3.5/5  Overall neat and clean; seems like a spacious area and it was not very busy when we arrived since the buffet was just starting up.  

Food: 3/5  There was less variety than I expected, but there was a salad bar, various cold cuts, fish, steak, chicken, pork, perogies, and a dessert table in the centre.  Overall the food was good.

Service: 3.5/5  We were seated quickly and overall efficient service.  

Price: 3/5  Price was high for the variety of food available.

Overall: 3/5  This was a standard dinner buffet.  Maybe it was just starting up when we arrived, but I was expecting more variety for the price.  I would probably consider eating elsewhere first if I were to attend an event here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is actually located within Hotel Blackfoot; inside the restaurant it appears pretty outdated and service is okay, nothing spectacular.

The first night we were here, we were yearning for some good buffet food, unfortunately we were pretty disappointed with the selection; there wasn't much variety of foods nor was there much food at all. We grazed on a few items that they did have available, but ended up getting something real to eat afterwards. The cost was okay, but I definitely wouldn't recommend or eat here again."}
