{"text":"Heard about this place at work and decided to check it out for lunch. The customer service and hospitality was awesome, not to mention they gave me complimentary beef patties while they prepared my order. The oxtails with rice n peas was on point! Oh yeah, their prices are soooo much more reasonable than the other caribbean restaurants I have visited.

 I only paid like 6 bucks for my meal versus the $12 ones I am used to. Great Reggae music and comfortable atmosphere. I even watched some crazy dance hall videos on their flat screen. 

The owner invited me to an after- hours party that they do on Fridays with a live DJ, I will definitly attend. Great place to be only less than 2 weeks old. MY personal experience was awesome."}
{"text":"Went back again last week 'cause I figured, hey those patty things are still delicious! 

What's good:    They got their credit/debit card reader set up so  you can pay with a swipe now!  Yay! 

They also streamlined the menu so the menu is smaller,  but you can get what's on it.    That's good! 

And they have 2 different kinds of \"patty\" things!!      Chicken and beef,  I think.       They're addictive like candy.       I wish they had some hot pepper sauce like tabasco or something on the table for the patties! 

So I'm putting up this review that's a little better than the last time I visited.     Yay improvement!!"}
{"text":"Young lady on the line was very disrespectful. Food took 2 hours to deliver. Ordered the Brown stew chicken. There is chicken, but where the stew? More light brown that brown stew like my moms used to make. Oxtail is OK, again colors off, taste is ok. Real Jamaicans cooking, just not very well. With the 2hour wait for food it ain't worth the bad customer service."}
{"text":"This place sucks...point blank period!!! Growing up on the East Coast; living amongst Jamaicans...I have had the opportunity to eat real Jamaican cuisine...and this is not it. The rice and peas tasted like crap.The texture was overcooked and flavorless. You cant tell me they did'nt use 10 Minute Boil a Bag rice!! The curry chicken was made with chicken breasts, not a whole chicken that gives it flavor when its cut down to the bone marrow.  The curry was bland! My curry chicken tastes wayyyyy better. The cabbage was soggy and again the common blandness. I had high hopes for this place. I feel sorry for these poor Phoenicians who think this is authentic island Yard flavor. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"been there a few times,  was not bad the first time I went.  only complaint I had was  their was more side dish than main course.  So I felt like I was getting a sample of the main dish (curry chicken, goat, etc) while paying full price.  

went again and didn't even finish my meal.  I guess they were having an off day with the flavor. So I'll be looking for another restaurant soon."}
