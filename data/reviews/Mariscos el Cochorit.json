{"text":"Came here for the first time with my family. I ordered ceviche and everyone's plate came out except mine. Waited and waited finally cancelled my order. Won't be back to this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mariscos el Cochorit is a pretty standard mariscos establishment. We ordered a full table of guacamole, micheladas, fajitas (beef, chicken, and shrimp), and one of the shrimp/seafood cocktails. The house salsas were good as well. 

Service was fine and the food was alright, nothing over the top (I thought the serving size for the guacamole was pretty small considering the charge). But when the bill came -- upcharges for water and credit card charges, I really just fel nickel and dimed about the whole thing,"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CM SERVICE ... 
waited over an hour to get our food & waitress was RUDE.
Ended up speaking to the manager. 
Didn't expect this from here :/"}
