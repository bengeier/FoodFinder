{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Food is fabulous, the staff is super nice. My husband and I love sitting at the bar, great atmosphere and the lovely female bartender (I don't know her name but she told us she is Russian) is absolutely awesome. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Freshest food I've found in Cleveland.  Killer (and inexpensive) wine list, and great ambiance.  Not fancy, but very well done."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food.  Have always had good, attentive service here.  Complimentary valet on the weekend!  Recommend the variety appetizer platter with  pita - it's yummy.  A bit on the pricey side overall, but worth it."}
{"text":"I took a group of about 16 clients and co-workers there for dinner. I selected this location because I have always had good meals there and it is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I also know that they are able to handle large groups well. Every member of my group raved about it the next day. These are people from all over the US and Canada.  One member of the group said he would make a 4 hour drive just to bring his wife there. I had the striped bass special. It was some of the best fish I've had in a long time. Two other members of the group had a lamb special, I think it was a braised lamb shank. They couldn't stop raving about it. I'd like to thank the management and staff for making my event a huge success."}
{"text":"Awesme food.  Great bar.  Best deserts.   Sometimes food is cooked different than the last time i ordered it.  Still pretty good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week. We left the restaurant and was assaulted by a gang of thugs. I ended up in the hospital. Lee road is unsafe. I contacted the cafe owner he never returned my call. I even stopped by and he would not see me. I dont think you want to give your money to a guy like this. The assault occurred very close to his restaurant. 

Avoid this place and know there are lots of robberies on lee road."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere with excellent service. Food was not as tasty and authentic as I expected."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is delicious and im a regular. Always great service and great for lunchtime!."}
{"text":"This is some of the freshest food I have ever eaten. It absolutely sparkles. I agree that this is one of the best values for mediterranean food that I can recall having had: just truly top notch, from the apricot juice through the perfectly-balanced entrees (the sauces are particularly good). Simple dishes you thought you knew, like baba ganoush, are so delicious that they are redefined. In fact, two of us often get a large appetizer plate as an \"entree,\" supplementing with a soup and more (fresh! so fresh!) feta.

Atmosphere is warm (gorgeous kilim, beautiful rich colors) indoors, delightful outdoors (well, except for the unavoidable traffic) and the service is perfect. 

I have to force myself not to go to this place every week!"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of friends for a birthday celebration. We had originally meant to go to another restaurant nearby, but due to the long wait, we decided to try Anatolia Cafe instead.

Pros:
The food was delicious, and I enjoyed trying new types of Middle Eastern food. The overall ambiance of the place was very nice. The restaurant seems to be split into smaller sections, which reduces noise and makes it feel homier. 

Cons:
The service was slow, even after factoring in the fact that we were a large party. The food was a bit pricey considering the portion size, at least for a student's budget (most entrees are ~$15)."}
{"text":"The appetizer plate is fantastic but I just don't get all the hullabaloo about the rest of it. Maybe it's the lack of other Eastern Mediterranean dining options for Clevelanders to compare it to but I find the mains to be bland and, in the case of the chicken, rubbery."}
{"text":"Casual, inviting, friendly staff, wonderful vegetarian options. One of my favorites is Veggie Stew with brown rice. It's dependably delicious. I love the ginger tea, but it is served only during winter. Mixed appetizer plate (large) is the perfect contribution to a dinner party. This is a really fantastic neighborhood/family restaurant."}
{"text":"My waiter had little knowledge of the menu and it showed. I was the only one there for lunch but no one came to check on my meal. I eventually waved someone down because the donas was dry and they told me they had no tatziki or cucumber yogurt to go with it. the red lentil soup was excellent. My waiter said he brought me the wrong size bowl to go with my lunch entree and reluctantly left it. the wine was extremely overpriced at $8 per glass for a $7 bottle. as I said the soup, Red lentil was excellent"}
{"text":"Absolutely no stars, this is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten.  The staff is rude and unprofessional. Their food is hit or miss. If you want Mediterranean food go to Tommy's or Aladdin's."}
{"text":"Anatolia is one of the most underrated restaurants in Cleveland. Their food is some of the best I have had. For those who want a little bit different, their Turkish cuisine is the way to go. I start with the Shepards salad with feta, which tastes really fresh and is a great way to start the meal. My favorite dish is their Lamb Shank, which is a special that they sometimes have depending on if it is available. The meat just falls off the bone and is cooked to perfection. To finish off a great meal, I would try their baklava, which is one of the best I have eaten. It is hard to go wrong with any other items on the menu. I have never received something I did not like. You can tell the food is prepared with care and they use fresh ingredients. They also have a patio where you can enjoy the food outside during the sunny days! I would highly recommend it. A great place to eat."}
{"text":"Absolute WORST dining experience I have ever had. My poor husband mid way through his dinner found himself chewing on something with an odd texture. What does he spit our but a used band aid! I wanted to throw up right there at the table. Upon informing the wait staff of the situation they offered to give his meal for free...... Are they kidding???? We were in a party of 6 people and they actually expected us to pay for this horrifying experience. They then gave us a $40 gift card, as if we would EVER return to this place again. If someone has a cut on their hand and is handling food in a kitchen, shouldn't they be required to wear gloves? The health department will be notified first thing in the morning. Bad situation, and even worse was the pitiful way the management handled the situation."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped for an early dinner and we were not disappointed. Plenty of vegetarian options appetizers & entrees. The hummus was some of the best we have had (and we are picky about our hummus, but ordered based on other reviews). Zucchini pancakes and vegetable stew were both delicious. Our server was a bit lacking in attentiveness, but was not representative of all servers in the establishment."}
{"text":"Small portions, over priced for what you get, and food is just very fair.  I had a very plain (and small, even though it was the large size on the menu) cucumber and tomato salad swimming in Italian dressing for $12.00 and a small helping of vegetarian moussaka that was pretty tasteless for $17.95, their special that night.  Total was $29.95.  A lot of money for that food!  I would give it a C.  Plenty of other good and great restaurants to choose from.  I've experienced way better. My opinion is you don't need to eat at this one."}
{"text":"Quite good. I like the appearance both inside and out. Anatolia's sidewalk seating adds much to the appearance of what is otherwise still a rather bleak streetscape on Lee. The food is good, but in the past couple of years it's seemed to slip a little. Still, this is one of the better Cleveland Heights restaurants."}
{"text":"Anatolia has great food and an excellent patio. This is a go to lunch spot for me during the warmer months! The zucchini cakes are just delicious and are served with spinach that is wonderful!  Also, there appetizer platter/ sampler is large and great way to try many of their delicious options!This is a great spot for dates or girl nights!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. We dine here frequently and have never had a bad meal. Flavors are always spot on. If you like lamb, this is the best place in the area to get it. Their adana wraps are delicious too. One of our favorite dishes is Iskender, which is thinly sliced gyro meat in a butter-tomato sauce, topped with fresh yogurt. Vegetarians and omnivores alike will love the Zucchini Pancakes or Vegetarian Mixed Grill Platter (importantly, the vegetables are cooked to the proper doneness). The calamari here is about the best we've had, with the lightest coating of flour and a deliciious garlic dipping sauce. We always order one of their fresh salads, usually the White Bean Salad or Shepherd Salad. And do not miss the best baklava you may ever have. 

Servers are always courteous and efficient. In warm weather, the outdoor patio is a lovely place to dine. Valet parking is available, but there is free parking along side streets. I could go on, but you get the idea."}
{"text":"One Star. Visited the cafe for lunch based on the reviews. Sadly we were disappointed. The place was empty and yet we were sat down next to a group of people. Why not sit us two tables away? It is a big place. The food was mediocre. My wife had gotten the chicken shish special, with four little pieces of chicken. Server was lazy, uninterested and never asked how our food was. No refills or smiles here. I've eaten better  Mediterranean in Kent OH and Chicago. My only regret is dropping 30.00 and leaving a decent tip. Do yourself a favor and avoid! Will not return."}
{"text":"Food was excellent - appetizers, meal and dessert!  From the saut√©ed kalamari to the lamb patties, kebab, lamb shank and baklava, everything was amazing!!  Full of flavor. It was like eating at my grandmothers house. Friendly wait staff. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for my birthday and it was a great evening.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere was warm and lively, the service was immpecible.  I look forward to returning.
Don't forget quarters for Cleveland Heights parking."}
{"text":"Love Anatolia. We often go after a  7:00 film down the road, sit at the high tables by the 
bar and order a few drinks, baba and wonderful lamb kebabs.The rice and seasonal vegetables are always deceptively flavorful. Reasonably priced wine by the glass is a much appreciated rarity"}
{"text":"Having just moved from Chicago, we are a little nervous about finding food that matches what we're used to. We were lucky to find Anatolia as I think they come pretty close.

The prices were a little on the high end, but the food was delicious. Our waiter was a bit surly, but he provided some recommendations and we were glad we listed to him as they were very good.

Tip: Ask your waiter for recommendations, even if you're familiar with Turkish food because you may be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! Love the Baba ghanoush and stuffed eggplant dinner. I would give it five stars but there was a bug problem."}
{"text":"For all people who knows what Mediterranean Cuisine is, just STAY AWAY. They are PRICY with the worst service ever. I waited for 20 minutes to get my check only after I asked them to bring it. I finished my meal with an empty glass cause no body felt that they should refill it for me since they take gratuity anyways!!!!They are trying to serve Mediterranean food but they are far away from being Mediterranean. I'm Mediterranean and I've been eating Mediterranean food all my life and this was the worst. Again-- STAY AWAY from this place if you want to have a good day."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people keep on recommending this place. I've got 3 times in the last year, thinking maybe I just caught it on an off night. Nope.

Service is slow. Food is fine, but not that flavorful and way, way over priced. 

That said their mint tea and their baklava are great. so I may find myself on their patio with both in front of me this summer."}
{"text":"The food was great, But the service was very poor.  We were the only ones in the place, and out waiter disappeared. I actually had to leave my seat to go and find him. I will not return."}
{"text":"For the first time in six years of faithfully eating at, recommending, and otherwise championing this establishment, I asked to speak with the manager/ owner after an evening of comically, egregiously poor service. Upon hearing of my party's discontent, he got up in my face, pointing at me, argued with me about the root of our displeasure, and ultimately added the glass of wine back on that had (accidentally?) been left off our check. 

Is it surprising I will never return to Anatolia? 

Of course, I prefer Istanbul in Tremont now; the staff is so much nicer and the food is even a step up, and it is less expensive."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  Food is the real deal...  I want to travel to Turkey so much more now.

Baba ghanooj was the best I have ever had.

Kofte was good, but made great by the Turkish hot sauce our waiter offered.

Service was attentive, quick, and went above an beyond in a few different ways."}
{"text":"Good meats, vegetarian appetizers and desserts. But stay away from the Vegetarian Main dishes. 

Meat, appetizers (the vegetarian appetizers) and the kunefe and the rice pudding were all very good. The kazandibi was just OK - not the real thing. 
However at two different times, the main Veg. dishes were very poorly cooked. One the mixed veggie (guvec) had the veggies still raw (egpplant needs to be cooked thoroughly in Turkish cousine). Another time, we tried the okra, and the whole dish was bad. The onions were chopped very large, and still raw, as was all the other veggies (tomatoes, okras). Clearly, those dishes were cooked by someone who had no clue about Turkish cooking.
Service: So so. The menu said (as another review here) the sigara borek came with the coban salad. When we asked, our waitress dismissed us: no it does not come together you need to order separately. She seemed grumpy.

We went back for the kunefe, though. Hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"The lentils soup was excellent and the green salad they add to it souce that make it so different 
The mix grill is perfect with big portion worth the price 
I like the gentle decoration and the Turkish music
Do not forget to have knafa on desert it is real made to perfection for sure I will visit this place again"}
{"text":"This is a great place!Location is great  and shrimp dish was seasoned to perfection.
 Memorable, pricey and good."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed the food, we all ordered something different so we could share. The coffee was amazing. The service was slow, which was weird because it was the middle of the day with almost no other customers. The waiter seemed uninterested in doing his job. But because the food was so good I was mostly willing to overlook that part of the dinner. Maybe he was just having a bad day. I would recommend this restaurant over many others in the Ceder-Lee district."}
{"text":"It was the worst time when I went there. The owner was a horrible person. He treats us so badly because I prayed. And they brought us an old bread."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Every meal I have had was great...fresh, well seasoned, and nice portions. Good service, and the owner, Yashar, is a great guy. Followed them from the original location at  Cedar Center to where they are now!"}
{"text":"I love the Anatolia Cafe. Never go wrong here!! Great Baba Ganoush and atmosphere is always fun. Lamb is always good and i never miss their turkish tea. Just wish it was closer so I could go more often. Out door seating in the summer is great."}
{"text":"It has been about 23 years since I was stationed in Turkey. The food beer n booze brings back many memories of my time there. I can say this authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"Five stars all around!  Chicken Kebob with yogurt was the best: excellent white meat mixed with a buttery tomato sauce nestled atop pita croutons, which got deliciously soggy in the aforementioned sauce.   Mmmm good!  You can't go wrong with the Shepherd's salad with feta = lunchtime happiness.  The Greek red wine is a solid choice - or should I say liquid smile?  And the desserts - ditch the diet and order the rice pudding or anything on the menu.   The warm pita triangles complete the circle of culinary bliss.  Outdoor patio seating is very pleasant, too!"}
{"text":"This place was the real deal. Food was very good, my waiter was extremely knowledgable and helpful. It's very affordable too. After dinner walk across the street and get some pastries and coffee at Stone Oven Bakery. Cleveland Heights is a cool little town."}
{"text":"For middle eastern cuisine the food here was surprising bland. Portions were very large, almost unmanageable. Positives include the appetizers and the interior which is clean, new and stylish. Lot is available behind the strip mall on the opposite side of the street."}
{"text":"Very friendly (helped us select great food).  The food, drink, dessert, and atmosphere are very nice.  We did not sit outside, but they have lots of choice.  This is a very popular part of town and parking is a pain, but there is a new parking deck nearby."}
{"text":"Disgusting just had a bloody band-aid in my food, and the manager won't come out to talk to me he sends out a busboy. Stay away calling the health dept right now!!!
So the sackless manager is hiding out won't talk to me but offers me 25% off my bill. Realy, no im sorry or any apology I have never been so insulted or grossed out in my life!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't want to leave feedback because we wish the best for.everyone BUT I have to warn anyone who appreciates good service and food to spend their hard earned money on. WORTHLESS we will not be back. I went with my family. My husband myself and my kids. First we couldn't understand the host, she slurred and ate all her words. Our server was more concerned with everything else other then our table. He did not want to listen to anything we needed or requested. Forgot to bring sauce, no options to drink, didn't come around unless we called him, etc. MEAL u ask? Tasteless, boiled, sloppy presentation. We ordered lamb main dish and chicken for the kids,  each dish andwas bland, cold, surprising to us had no flavor. We hv never experienced this before, first time for everything. Better yet our friends highly suggested this restaurant, although we won't give it a second chance. We would b embarrassed to suggest this place to anyone we know. Thank u for taking the time to read this, hopefully it saved u from wasting your time and money."}
{"text":"Great Kofta and Kabab.  Complimentary Valet Parking.  The desserts are wonderful and so is the turkish coffee.  The need to get someone in to read fate from the coffee grounds. Thick and dark.  Generous portions.  Friendly owner.  Huge seating area."}
{"text":"I have to say I 'm not blown away at all. Appetizers aren't great. I have had better hummus at alladin's even if it's a chain. And honestly I usually don't respect places who charge for tahini and hot sauce. There main course is decent again not blown away at all but too overhyped. Only good thing about this place is the complimentary valet. Otherwise I would any day choose alladin's or taza. You would know these places if you are a Cleveland local!!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Turkey.  It is the best Turkish food I had in America.  Not only the food is great, the service is excellent as well.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Anatolia is one of our favorite restaurants, it was surprising to read some of the negative reviews listed. I found the food portions to be perfect, I always leave with a to go container. The staff may not be the typical American type of service, but by no means are they rude- I think it's just a cultural difference. It is very similar to the service you get overseas. The food is fantastic, seriously tastes home made. I actually have brought friends from both Germany and Turkey and they all said it was some of the best Turkish food they have had in the states. I guess everyone has there own experiences, but if you are reading this review and considering going there- give it a shot and make your own opinion. I don't think you will regret it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with great (Americanized-ish) Turkish cuisine.  Their wraps with a bowl of soup is the perfect lunch.  Anatolia's felafel is probably my favorite in Cleveland. When I go there for dinner, I have to start off with their lentil soup, falafel and hummus (yes, all three).  By the time I get to their entree i am normally stuffed, but I still manage to thoroughly enjoy their Kofta."}
{"text":"We are from Pittsburgh and eating here first time while visiting Cleveland OH. I will tell you that this is the best Turkish food I have ever tried in America. Simply very delicious. Try lamb kebab , chicken kebab or filet mignon kebab. We loved it. Definitely , coming back! Thank you to the people who run this establishment."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Me and my wife are in the food industry and we know what it takes to please the customer - a smiley server/great atmosphere/flavored food are the perfect recipe. Our server was Mo and he made sure he was present at our table and had all the answers. In 2 years of living in the states we've been searching for traditional food and this has been so far the best mediterranean food. Everything sounds special so make sure you start with efes turkish beer and finish your meal with kadaif and a turkish coffee. We'll be back with more people... Evallah!!!"}
{"text":"This place uses quality ingredients, but were also somewhat pricey compared to the quantity. Most people shouldn't expect leftovers at this place - the portion size isn't that big. Meats, jasmine rice, dips, and salads tasted balanced and flavorful (but remember, its Turkish so it won't be as heavily seasoned as say, Indian). The dessert (kunefe) tasted sweet and delicious, but the cheese they talk about only fills about the inside half of the radius, with the outside half being purely the shredded phyllo dough.

The ambiance is pleasant and calm. It wasn't busy on a weekday evening. The service is prompt and courteous. Our waiter was not afraid to give his suggestions backed up with details.

Overall, a solid Turkish-Mediterranean restaurant if you are ok with the price point."}
{"text":"While the building d√©cor is nice and the food is decent, the staff is neither. We weren't greeted when we walked in the door. Our waitress was curt, impatient and I had to flag her down even to get a refill on my drink. The other staff saw that we needed something and also chose to ignore us as we waited. It took so long to get our bill that my companion went outside. The waitress finally came over and asked if I wanted dessert. I said no, my companion left and I just need the bill. As I walked out after paying, none of the staff said a goodbye or thank you. Even a patron pushed by me, storming out of the restaurant. I'm guessing he received the same kind of service that we did. I'm not going back there, not ever. I felt like we were invisible and unimportant. Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Great menu selections: kofte, baba ganoush, doner all on point. The chocolate mousse was quite possibly the best I have ever had. Yum!"}
{"text":"One of the best values for mediterranean cuisine in the Midwest USA, and also one of the best kept secrets for Turkish wines. You may think \"turkish wine, are you kidding?\"  Well, don't kid yourself.  The Kavaklidere red is comparable to any good, well-balanced American cabernet sauvignon or shiraz.

The food is splendid, served quickly and at perfect temperatures. Try the K√ñFTE, my personal favorite, served with white beans and veggies.

The service is top-notched.  The turkish people are genuinely warm and full of hospitality.  The general manager is professional and extremely customer-oriented."}
{"text":"My girlfriend surprised me and brought me here on a date.  We both had a wonderful time.  The service is excellent and the food is delicious.  I really have nothing negative to say and look forward to going back again.  A unique experience in Cleveland and well worth the short drive to get there."}
{"text":"I got a taste for doner kebabs after living in Germany where doner stands are located like every 10 feet through out the country  These things are for real tasty.  

Anatolia has the doner on lock down in Cleveland being that as far as I know, you can't get this Turkish delight anywhere else in town.  That said, I'm a little let down by their service after they moved to their new location on Lee road, but they seem to be really busy, so maybe it's just a new staff acclimating thing."}
{"text":"Had a very romantic and long overdue dinner with my beautiful wife here.
She's not \"adventurous\" with food, so I was apprehensive about her liking it.
She loved everything, as did I.
Service was excellent even during the dinner rush, and they honored my request 
to have a small orchid on the table when we arrived."}
{"text":"Anatolia is a great place to visit if you're craving anything Middle Eastern. The baklava and appetizer sampler are a must try. I am also a huge fan of the filet minion shish kabob. The service can be a little slow sometimes but the quality of food makes up for it."}
{"text":"My favorite Middle eastern type restaurant (Turkish) in the Cleveland area. They provide great vegan options and have a fairly good happy hour. I would love if the Turkish beer was included on the happy hour menu. They have a descent patio but the staff could be better. Overall a great place for a date. Everyone must try the babagannush!!!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Anatolia Cafe. I'd read about Turkish food lately, and had a hankering for D√∂ner for the longest time. I spent a summer in Spain and had it like 2 times a day. How I long for those times!  Anyway the wifey and I went with another couple and had a bit of everything. The sampler appetizer platter was fantastic. A little of the majority of their appetizers and it did not disappoint. We also tried the Sigara B√∂regi which was fantastic. When it came to the entr√©es, I had the Iskender which was amazingly flavorful, and a pleasure to eat. The portion size was right, and each item on the plate complimented the others.  The wife got the regular D√∂ner plate, and the couple also got that to share. I think that each of us were impressed with our order.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate mousse. It too was flavorful, and had the right amount of ganache.  As far as service goes, I was very happy. It was a Saturday night, so the place was packed, but we were able to secure a table after about a 10 minute wait.  Our server was very attentive and our needs were met.  She did forget to switch my wife's rice for fries, but quickly made up for the error. In all, I was very happy with every aspect of our visit to Anatolia Cafe, and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"While the hummus is too bland for my taste, the red lentil soup and doner were good. The menu notes items that are gluten free."}
{"text":"Holy speedy service and not remotely a letdown. We got the eggplant with tomato sauce, lebni, tabbouleh, falafel and hummus for apps and they were all outstanding. The falafel were flat pancakes which was different and a bit under seasoned but still yummy. The tabbouleh was outstanding, not too scalliony or oily. We had the stuffed cabbages for the main meal and it was delicious although less cabbagy than expected. The rice pudding and the baklava were delicious. All around we'll be back even if the waitress was incredibly underwhelmed to serve is."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service, and reasonable prices. The tabouli, served with warm pita, was delicious! A great place for a wonderful meal before the movies at Cedar Lee!"}
{"text":"I went with really high hopes. I ordered the lamb shank which was on special. We waited for an hour after ordering and it came out cold. The lamb shank didn't come with any cabbage or veggies."}
{"text":"The food itself was good. It was a bit more on the expensive side for a regular portion of food.

I got the Beef Filet Mignon Shish Kabob plate. It was just a plate of coconut rice with a side of purple cabbage coleslaw and 5-6 pieces of beef. I asked for medium but they made it more medium well than medium rare. I'm no meat expert but I don't think those pieces of beef were filet mignon. So that was a little disappointing.

My husband got the Salami Omelette on the brunch menu. It was really tasty but small portion again.

Comes with some hard pita bread pieces. Would've been better if it was softer.

The servers were nice though."}
{"text":"We eat mediterranean food most of the time. This place def stacked up to our expectations.
We had great service, food came out fast and it was hot! Drinks were great, dessert was great, outside seating was great, price was great. Everything was great. I have 0 criticisms and we will be back often."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my family, I wouldn't say it is a good place for kids, but our kids behaved pretty well this time, making it easier. Our waiter was accommodating of our little ones and the food was delicious. They have a wide variety of foods to choose from, it is a little pricey though. Will definitely keep going back sans kiddos."}
{"text":"Excellent Turkish food. Delectable selection of kebabs, fish and lamb with delicious vegetarian options as well. Very classy and romantic ambience if less crowded, especially during weekdays. 
The servers are warm and service is quick. It has quickly become one of our favorites"}
{"text":"Authentic, great atmosphere, great service, low prices, and reliably great food! Perfect for any occasion. The mixed appetizer and cigara-boregis are great and medium-rare filet mignon shish kebob is the finest piece of meat in town!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and although I love the food I've given a 4 because the service leaves a lot to be desired at times.
Among the appetizers I've tried the baba ganoush which is absolutely delicious!!! The hummus is good, the sigara boregi is yummy. Family had tried the sauteed liver cubes and liked it. I don't eat it :(
For mains , love the lamb adana, kofte and doner! All delicious so I'd get a combination of them!
The stuffed eggplant is pretty good too, has a decent amount of minced meat in it
Out of the desserts I love the rice pudding! It's very wholesome!"}
{"text":"Been to Anatolia several times but hadn't had anything memorable til my last visit. The seafood saut√© was excellent - I couldn't choose between salmon and shrimp and this was the perfect mix, also including calamari. The sauce really made the dish. I also tried their baba - it was really bland and I was disappointed. I also think they charged me the non happy hour price for that app and that was annoying since the dish wasn't good at all! Their pita bread is swerved warm and is soft and pillowy. Yum! They also have my fave sauvignon blanc (Kim Crawford). I'd definitely be back for the seafood dishes. The restaurant is busy but wasn't too crowded for a Friday night. They have a cozy fireplace in the back, the ambiance is good for a date. It was a a little pricey compared to other restaurants on Lee, an app, entree, and one glass of wine was $42."}
{"text":"Very nice place locally for Middle Eastern food. The ambience is cozy, and I appreciate the fireplace in the back (as well as the streaming one from the projector when we were there). Great for cold Cleveland nights brrrrrr

3 stars because of the overpriced entrees. For what we are getting, ~18 dollar entrees are definitely a touch out of reality. I could do less of the ambience and put the cost savings back into the food. Perhaps close up half of it on less busy days? The day we visited was pretty empty for a weekday at primetime dinner (7-8). Recoup on electricity and staff...need some consulting here imo.

Parking isn't ideal - on par with the area though. Few spots in the back, wouldn't be surprised if half of them are staff.  Side streets are residential (with the weird one sided parking rule). Be warned if you are coming with a large group."}
{"text":"Fantastic service at the bar. The bartender was more than kind and chatty and she recommended the lamb shank. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Yes, yes, yes. 

We stopped in here before a tango class at urban winery (yes, check that out) and loved it. We got the yogurt chicken kebab (amazing), cold mezze starter (a bit overpriced for what you got but great, fresh taste) and the signature dessert. We loved it and I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Meze platter (a collection of cold appetizers) was amazing, from the hummus and tabouli to the eggplant. What a great start to our meal. 

I ordered the lamb okra and my husband ordered the lamb adana (missing nutrients in our diet, perhaps?).  My lamb okra was just OK. It likely had to do with the overwhelming amount of okra in my stew... but I also wonder if some ingredients weren't as fresh, since something tasted slightly off throughout my meal. My husband's lamb was much tastier though - more seasoned. Also, I know everyone else was very pleased with their meal (e.g., liver cubes), so I'm willing to guess I had an uncommon occurrence.

But the desserts are phenomenal, which is quite amazing since I'm not a dessert girl.  My favorite was the kadayif. Granted, it looked nothing like it's picture but it tasted so good - much like a baklava but less sweet; the cheese balanced the sweetness and phyllo beautifully.  A close second was the baked rice pudding - very fluffy and delightful, with the perfect amount of cinnamon to top it off. The baklava was very tasty as well (but how can you say no to baklava?). My father-in-law raved about his Turkish delight, so it was a very good time!

Parking was a hassle, but I would definitely come back for dessert someday!  Seemed like the area may be reviving?"}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but way overpriced. Prices are inflated and they charge you too much for every food and give extremely small portions"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Anatolia. If you want authentic delicious Turkish food, this is the place to go. It was my parents' wedding anniversary and our server, Yucel, provided excellent customer service, including treating us to chocolate mousse with a candle! I highly recommend Yucel, the sweet cheese dessert, and anything eggplant this place has."}
{"text":"A really nice little Turkish/Mediterranean place by the Cedar Lee theater - so after you're done seeing the latest snooty art flick, you can wash it down with some kebabs.  

The food here isn't fancy, but it is eminently satisfying.  Their yogurt kebabs are absolutely amazing, full of tasty chicken in a moist yogurt-based sauce that's zingy and beautiful.  Their baba ghanoush is a little grainy, but tastes good.  In fact, everything here tastes good - it's the kind of restaurant that's never exceptional, but literally anything you can point to on the menu is going to satisfy.  

Plus, the atmosphere is very relaxing.  The staff are friendly, the tables cozy, and they'll let you talk for hours.  Never had a problem here.  

It's not the kind of top-shelf place where I'd take my family when I wanted to impress them, but it IS the kind of place I keep going back to with my friends when I want to chat over some food.  It's homey, in all the best ways.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was good to very good. We got eggplant appetizer, which was excellent, and red lentil soup which was OK. Adana kebab was very good. Fillet mingon steak was very good, except the piece that was totally burnt. Kunafe dessert and tea very good. Indoor sitting was comfortable. But, they need to take care of their outside patio which was in complete neglect and gave a bad impression. Service was OK. Nothing too special or too bad. Given the overall quality of food and indoor place, I was happy with my visit."}
{"text":"Not too many places like this, such a gem. Only stopped in for drinks but checked out the menu and am excited to try the food!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My mom always takes her friends there when they visit Cleveland. The food is authentic, savory, and well-prepared. 

Last night, we started with the Meze Platter followed by the Filet Mignon Shish Kebab, Chicken Shish Kebab (Tavuk ?i?), and Baklava for dessert. The Filet was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy. The Chicken was flavorful and very savory. The Meze Platter had some amazing baba ganoush! Exceptional Baklava, especially a day later when we had more of it for breakfast! 

The service was very good. I felt like the waitstaff and waiter went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. I think it is a family establishment and they are trying very hard. I believe in family restaurants and I have much more patience with them than large, corporate places. Restaurants are difficult to run, and my concern is mostly on food quality. But we were were well taken care of here, and we felt very happy with the food and service. 

I feel like this is a more of a special occasion place to go, because the decorations are nice and the atmosphere and prices are a little more upscale."}
{"text":"Excellent food, I'm haunted by the sigara boregi (in part because I don't remember how it is spelled.)

because the bar has such a great range of drinks available, there are some grownup-worthy nonalcoholic drinks as well. (I love the sour cherry juice.)"}
{"text":"I've dined in Istanbul, Turkey and never thought I would find another restaurant as good as the ones back there but this place was absolutely amazing. All the meats were cooked perfectly and very delicious. The service here is also perfect. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone and will eat here every time I'm in Cleveland. It was one of the best meals I've had in one week of being in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I came here for a graduation dinner with some family and friends. We were looking for a place to go last minute and this one was able to accommodate us on short notice (we had called a couple other places first), given that there was a marathon, graduation, and a festival all going on in Cleveland the same weekend. That was nice. 

This place serves amazing baba gannoush. A friend took me here years ago, where I first tried it, and since then, I've compared all others to this one. It has an intense, smoky but light flavor to it and it's paired with baskets of warm pita bread. It's definitely my favorite thing to get here.

We all got some combination of kabobs with rice. I got lamb and filet mignon--super tender, juicy and cooked just right. I gobbled mine up in a totally lady-like fashion, finishing first at the table. No one really had complaints about their food. My mom just casually mentioned that hers was a little dry and the waiter immediately brought some yogurt sauce, which improved it for her.

The decor's really nice with lots of windows, and luckily it was a nice weekend so it felt really bright. The service was a little on the slower side and the restaurant was maybe 80% full the day. There's a small parking lot in the back, enough for maybe 10 cars, so you may have to deal with street parking."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here sometimes my husband who is Turkish craves food from his home country. We came here and ask to be seated outside. We sat for 15+ mins without a server coming to acknowledge us or take drink orders nothing. We were disappointed. It is not a close trip for us. We did eventually leave and told the hostess why?? We will stick to Istanbul Grill in Avon. Very good food and friendly people."}
{"text":"Been here several times and the food has been fantastic every time! Love the kabobs, the lentil soup and all the desserts. One of our go-to places for date night!"}
{"text":"We went there few months ago. The waiter was so inefficient and seemed inexperienced. She never checked on us to ask if we did like the food or if we need anything. The food itself taste good but the portion is a JOKE!!! Very small portion in relation to the price you pay. Not only that, with there rude service they deduct gratuity from the total check too. 
I think they should improve their service and increase the food portion!"}
{"text":"Great lunch deal! Gotta love the $10 for appetizer and entr√©e. Tastes were on par with what I've had in Turkey. 

Got the baba ganoush, which was creamy & served with warm wheat pita. Entr√©e was chicken andana, perfect flavor & very tender, with wheat bulgar that's beautifully fluffy. Goes terrifically with the hot sauce they give you.  Date had the doner, generous slabs of beef with yogurt sauce. Even their white rice tasted great! We were too full to try dessert but they have a lot of the traditional Turkish sweets. 

Service was attentive & friendly & knowledgeable. Couldn't ask for more. The restaurant is pretty large, with comfy seating & huge windows for people watching."}
{"text":"Is it Turkish, or Russian?  I have no idea, but they have both Russian and Turkish beers on the menu.

The food was solid; babbaganoush, Schawarma, Grape Leaf rolls all made for a mean meal, served promptly out in a cool Cleveland summer night.

A good place to relax in the summer, this place is right down the street for me.  Makes me quite happy, trying out my broken Russian."}
{"text":"I'm still between a 3.5-4 for Anatolia.

Came here recently on a Saturday night with out of town guests. I called Saturday afternoon and they still had reservations available for 7pm. Getting reservations was the right idea though because the restaurant filled up quickly! 

The atmosphere in the evening is quite cozy, with the warm interior colors and light fire in the back. We definitely enjoyed ourselves. 

We ordered the hot saut√©ed liver cubes appetizer, and I definitely think this was one of my favorites. Really good spices and flavor. We also had the cigar burek filled with feta. 

I ordered one of the specials, vegetarian moussaka! I can't resist moussaka. Overall, it was satisfying and completely filling, but was slightly lackluster flavor-wise. The others got the lamb shank special (it was huge!) and the lamb kofte. It is a little pricy, but again, we were satisfied. And it's lamb."}
{"text":"I go to Anatolia very often and they are showing no signs of slowing down there excellent food and service. Meat is always fresh and the sides of rice and red cabbage are delicious. The most recent time I have gone, the waiter was awesome! He gave me and brother the best cocktails I have ever had for FREE! For desert, you have to try the Kinefe(probably a mis-spell). It's basically goat cheese, crunchy things and whipped cream. Best Turkish food in CLE."}
{"text":"Anatolia recently moved from Cedar Center to the Cedar Lee neighborhood. It's a whole new ballgame at the new location! The restaurant is spacious, sunlight flows in, and the d√©cor is comfortable and designed in very good taste.

We split the Mixed Appetizer which we all enjoyed - the eggplant being the favorite. We loved the Lamb Shish Kebab but weren't too crazy about the Chicken Saute. The rice pudding dessert was awesome.

Service was solid - our server was personable, sincere, and seemed to be enjoying himself! Anatolia is a great bet for reasonably priced and well-prepared food. I'll probably come quite often for takeout ..."}
{"text":"Was with a large party of 25 people so we got to try number of appetizers. Appetizers were pretty good, the usual fare. As far as main courses, stay away from Zucchini Pancake, very salty to a point of being inedible, but kudos to our server, replaced it right away. Filet Mignon Shish Kebab is amazing, probably best in town, Chicken Shish Kebab was very good too. Our server had his hands full with our party of 20 so can't judge a service by that, but he was efficient to the best of his abilities."}
{"text":"The red lentil soup is outstanding. Perfect blend of flavors - nicely balanced. The hummus is the best! Can't wait to visit Anatoli's  again."}
{"text":"Anatolia recently moved from the little shopping center on Cedar to new space on Lee.  The new space is large but warm and it's good to see they are doing so well.  It can be busy at times, but I have never had trouble getting a table or had the service suffer.

The food is great!  I tend to gravitate towards the Iskender (doner kebabs over croutons with a tomato and yogurt sauce-mmmmm soo good)  But everything else I have had there is delicious as well.  And it is hard for me to resist finishing the meal without some of their Baklava.

Everything is tasty and I really enjoy going here."}
{"text":"Pictures can truly be deceiving. When I saw the pictures on yelp I was greatly impressed and like wow this looks like a really good Turkish restaurant. However, it turned out to be not that good at all. The food was not as good as other Turkish restaurants I have been to before. The appetisers were too salty and the main courses were mediocre at best. When the former turned out to be a disappointment I tried my luck with dessert and a real Turkish restaurant can't go wrong with a Kunafa, right ? Huh \"you sweet summer child\" I told myself, you were mistaken. I could have forgiven them for everything for a killer Kunafa, but the sorry excuse for Kunafa I ordered was terrible ! To add salt to injury I was super hungry when I ate there, anything should have tasted delicious to me. Oh, one more thing, I couldn't decide if our waitress was rude or nice ? I was truly confused."}
{"text":"Love Anatolia!  \There's something very authentic going  on here that other places around town seem to lack.  And the location is great.  Beyond that, they have something for everyone - vegans, vegetarians and hardcore meat eaters won't have a problem leaving satisfied from Anatolia.  Beyond that, service here is excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesomely fresh and tasty Mediterranean (I guess to be specific, Turkish) food.   Our group got the Meze platter and also the combo grilled platter to share which had a nice array of their cold appetizers and grilled meats to share.  Everything was flavorful and fresh!
A must to order to dessert is the kunefe - a nice sweet, mildly salty dessert pastry with crispy shredded phyllo dough wrapped around cheese and topped with honey.  It sounds different, i know.  but is amazing.  Just get it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just short of outstanding.  It's one of our family's favorite places to go to celebrate birthdays, since the food is so good.  The main entrees and desserts are 5-star.   The noise, service, and a few of the side dishes are 3-star.

On our most recent visit, early on a Sunday evening, the service was inconsistent.  At times very attentive.  Other times, we couldn't find our server.  The first basket of pita served with the salad seemed like stale leftovers from the previous night.  The salads are too big and expensive to be side salads, but are not big enough to be a full meal. These are the things keeping this review from being 5-star.

The main entrees, like always, were great.  Lamb shish kabobs were perfectly cooked, as was a seafood saut√©e dish my mother-in-law ordered.  The best dish was one the nightly specials, Manti, a lamb-filled dumpling served with two different sauces--a tomato sauce and a yogurt sauce.  And the baklava was fresh and tasty as always.  I have not found a better piece of baklava in Cleveland, and trust me, I've looked."}
{"text":"Anatolia! After hearing so many great things for a few months, I was excited to finally come here. Metered street parking is available directly along the same street, it was Sunday and I had no trouble finding a spot. 

It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, it took about 10 minutes to be acknowledged, though not too busy outside, maybe it was busy inside. 

We ordered the traditional Turkish salad, the cheese cigars, and the chicken and lamb kabobs. The salad I am used to and absolutely love, loved it here too. The cheese pastry cigars are amazing, kind of salty but I love salty and these were really delicious. The chicken was undercooked, rubbery texture which grossed me out. The lamb was flavorful but still felt like something was missing, also didn't think that it was cooked to its full potential. 

For dessert, we ordered the knaffeh, which is a dessert I am very familiar with, and they earned 5 stars on dessert! It was absolutely delicious and I would probably come back just for the knaffeh dessert. 

We experienced service with a few different waiters, all of whom were pleasant. I will definitely be back here for the knaffeh but next time I will try different menu items with better luck, hopefully."}
{"text":"Food is really good except the portion size is small, dropped one star. I drooped the other star because Kunafe isn't as good as Istanbul Cafe and Turkish tea wasn't good at all.  The first time I had Turkish tea was at Istanbul cafe Avon and it is the best. Bakhlwa doesn't have that fresh crispiness."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week, and I just loved it. It totally lives up to the rave reviews my best friend living in Cleveland gave it. I'd strongly recommend the mixed appetizers platter with its amazing hummus of different types. Their white bean salad is to die for!  My husband loved his grilled lamb. There are so many yummy options for veggies too--I personally adored the feta cheese rolls as an entree. I really like that they use the best herbs mixed with everything. And the baklava is lovely, one of the most crisp and flaky ones I've ever had. I like that they have good parking. Will definitely try to go there the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wow.  Baby boomers were here in full effect on Saturday night.  I felt like I was crashing everyone's parents' date night.  

The main dining room was a bit noisy but the excellent decor, service, and food more than made up for it.  The mixed cold appetizer included just about everything you can spread on a pita.  The spicy diced vegetables were easily my favorite item on the platter, followed by the stuffed grape leaves.  The baba ganoush was not especially garlicky or eggplanty tasting and didn't wow me.  

For entrees, the menu is very meat-heavy.  I had the Chicken Adana Kebab, which consisted of ground chicken in a tomato-butter sauce with yogurt on top of pita \"croutons\" which looked like pieces of pita bread.  I would recommend this dish if you're looking for something different but not too out-there.  

Others at the table ordered the Chicken Shish and Chicken Kebab which didn't look too exciting, as they consisted of chicken hunks with rice and chicken hunks with sauce, respectively.  

For dessert we split the baklavah.  It was incredibly sweet and rich, and was just the right amount for each of us to have a few bites."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I'm giving 4 stars because I got dessert to go and the menu says $5 but I was charged $8 for the kadayif."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time, because I LOVE middle eastern style food.   I stopped here after work on a Friday, cozied up to the bar for just appetizers and a cocktail.  No Happy Hour on Fridays:-(, but everything was reasonably priced, so I really didn't mind.  The patio was packed with couples, families, etc., enjoying the beautiful weather.   I ordered the tabouli, falafel and a Pomegranate Splash.   The bartender was super accommodating and very busy, going back and forth between serving patrons at the bar and refilling water and clearing dishes on the patio.   I received my cocktail while waiting for my food.  The Pomegranate Splash was a little bit sweet and Hawaiian punch like, but I asked for some lime on the side to cut the sweetness.  The drink was very good.   Soon thereafter my appetizers arrived, accompanied by a basket of warm flatbread triangles and a bottle of olive oil.   The tabouli was slightly different than I'm used to, lots of green onion and a little bit dry.   I added a little bit of olive oil and asked for some lemon wedges.  These additions brightened the dish and I ate it all!!   The falafel was also very good.  4 hand pressed oval palm sized patties, instead of the traditional balls.  I actually liked the patties better.  The patties were very tender, flavorful, not at all greasy or dry.   The falafel was accompanied by a very refreshing yogurt sauce.

All-in-all this was a very good experience and can't wait to go back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Good food, ok service, beautiful decor. I had the Iskender kebab. I loved the meat itself; it was delicious. The tomato-ish sauce tasted nicely, and the yogurt was awesome, probably one of the best yogurts I've tested, with a beautiful homemade flair. The \"croutons\" were also perfect in consistency and flavor. I've been twice to this restaurant, and I like my Iskender so much that I had it both times. The baba ganoush was good, even for me (not a fan). It was very authentic tasting,  and you could really feel that grilled flavor of the eggplant. Definitively, a must try.

{"text":"A wonderful restaurant!
Great food and a cool atmosphere!
Love the eggplant, shrimp with veggies in tomato sauce, and ke bobs.
For apps, I like the hommus, baba, and lebni.
Love the pita and the new eggplant appetizer.
Anything that you order is fabulous!!!!
An authentic Turkish gem!"}
{"text":"I came in on a rainy night, 10/20/2011 to be specific at about 6. I asked if the combos came with the rice and vegetables, and the hostess confirmed they were. I then asked for a table and was soon seated. I had picked out a combo of the turkish equivalent of shwarma, and the ground lamb that had onions.

I then waited for 15 minutes while the rest of the staff played a game of pretend Sam H. Doesn't exist. 

They won, after 15 minutes of not being asked if I wanted anything to drink, or to know what the specials were I left. I had my menu closed, in front of me for 14 of those minutes. I made eye contact with different members of the wait staff, to no avail.

I would recommend not going to Anatolia Cafe, probably ever. On a night where 3 other tables had occupants, I was paid no mind. The food may be tasty, but it's not worth being treated poorly, as I was last night, this is a fact. Across the street is the much more affordable Stone Oven. Try them instead!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here. I usually order the same dishes: red lentil soup, cucumbers in yogurt appetizer,  hunter salad and either the lamb chops or the whole fish.  Always delicious and always attentive, if sometimes inexperienced,  service. 

I'd give it 5 stars except for the occasional inexperience of the wait staff, a limited wine selection and I just got buzzed by a fruit fly .... as other reviews have noted.   It's late December and 26 degrees outside ... come on man! get rid of the fruit flies...."}
{"text":"In getting ready for my trip to Turkey, I figured I'd check out some Turkish food at Anatolia. If you like grilled meat, you will love this place. Turkish food consists of a lot of kebabs, dips and soft warm pita. Good stuff. 

For an appetizer, I had the Ezme, which is minced tomatoes, walnuts, onions, parsley, garlic, spices and a lemon olive oil dressing. It was excellent on the homemade pita. I highly recommend this.  For my entree, I opted for the Doner, which is a shaved lamb and beef mixture. Unfortunately, it was basically gyro meat... I would have liked to try something more out of the ordinary, but it was my own fault. I ordered it. It was really good though. The meat was served sliced with a side of rice pilaf and some (mushy and unnecessary) veggies. Also on the side, some cucumber yogurt sauce and warm pita. I made mini gyros with it. 

The decor is great. Lots of pretty Turkish rugs and various wall hangings. The outdoor patio is huge and really nice as well. 

If you like Aladdin's, you will love Anatolia. 
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All A's!
What a special place.  Don't miss the hummus. My salad (house) was fresh and properly dressed.
The lamb was prepared just as I asked.  I'm still puzzled by how they can prepare simple rice with so much Flavor.
The service was warm and knowledgable.
I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Turkish restaurant ever. We make sure to come here every time we are in town. The mixed appetizer and mixed grill give you a taste of several items. Don't miss going to this place if you are in town.

Just finished desert. So good."}
{"text":"I had dinner here their food was really tasty and authentic.  I had the filet mignon shish kebab-- it was very tasty!  I would totally go back when I visit Cleveland once again."}
{"text":"This is, by far, one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Why you ask? Fantastic food, as ethnic as it gets and I do know my Turkish food, cozy, also very ethnic decor, super friendly and professional wait staff. Did I mention generous portions and always a dining room crowded with interesting people?! Add that to the mix, and it makes for a unforgettable trip to Turkey right on your back yard... I honestly cannot count all the times I have eaten here, be that with family, friends or coworkers and I have left completely satisfied EACH TIME! Kudos to Anatolia!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely location, great outdoor space, & cool ambiance.

Food:  OK.  I tried the Roast Eggplant...was really expecting an explosion of flavor...not so much.  Also tried the lamb shank, lamg & okra (very tasty), and a few desserts.  The dessert that was shredded phyllo dough with some type of chees was absolutely delish.

I would try this place againmaybe with a large group that ordered various dishes that eveyone could try as last night did not deliver the flavor I was expecting after all the referrals and reveiws about Anatolia Cafe."}
{"text":"The kebabs of Anatolia Cafe are just perfect. Juicy, tender, served hot and tasty. The servers are awesome and the location in Lee road is perfect. There's parking in the back or across the street behind Phoenix coffee.

I'm definitely coming back for the kebabs as I was skewered with delight. True story."}
{"text":":         

Visited this restaurant based on the reviews and it was a huge disappointment. The service was shit and the food was barely edible and wayyyy overpriced. I have volunteered at homeless shelters that served better food better than this. If there is a rating less than one star Anatolia would have earned it. 

I can proudly say this is the worst restaurant I have ever visited."}
{"text":"Food was good but a little on the bland side. We ordered falafel and hummus as appetizers. Hummus was ok but falafel were good. We also ordered lamb okra and lamb adana. The adana was tender and juicy but could've used more salt.  Lamb okra was delish! Great wait staff!"}
{"text":"Dinner was a delight at this spiffy little Turkish place.  As expected, you'll get Mediterranean delights with the Turkish slant, but the atmosphere, service, and food are spot-on, and the prices are way more than fair.

Be aware that parking here in this area at night is very difficult and though they have a lot behind the building it only has room for a few cars.  

Tip:  Order a shot of the Raki before getting started.  It's a Turkish equivalent to Ouzo and has a similar flavor.  But importantly, only well-heeled travelers know about Raki and you'll get bonus points from your server for getting it.

They'll serve it with a dish of ice on the side...drop in a couple of cubes as this is how they drink it...watered down just a tad.  The water reacts to the Raki and turns it from crystal clear to milky white.  The science experiment alone is worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends. Got seated right away. Service was good and only like 4% awkward. We got a bottle of red Turkish wine - really delicious and complimented our meals: doner kebob, adana kebob, and the lamb kafta. We also got the Shepard salad which was fresh and had a lot of flavor. My friends thought that their Kebobs actually lacked in seasoning and flavor. I thought my Adana Kebob was pretty good and had the traditional flavor of the red pepper there but I feel like it could've been spicier (from previous tries). I don't know about my friends but the rice on my plate had no flavor, just felt steamed. We also got the cheese boregs which were pretty yummy. Maybe they were a little salty because it seemed like there was only feta in there but really worked well with the Shepard salad. We also got the baklava - it was delicious. I had it with some house blend tea which complimented it very well. Overall, I enjoyed my dinner probably more than my friends but it was good to eat great quality food... just need to tinker with some things."}
{"text":"Dinner- Lamb Kabobs are on point! Great hummus and Filet Kabobs as well. Very reasonably priced.

Came on a different occasion on a cold night to grab drinks. They had the fireplace going and warm atmosphere.  Unbelievably friendly, welcoming bartender, real fun environment, made us feel right at home. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I recommend coming here for lunch, as the prices for the dinner service do tend to get a bit high. The kunefe is almost always delicious, however, the portion size here is double what i am used to and is a bit out of control. Be careful when you order, especially if you have hypertension (or any salt sensitivity), because the cooks here are VERY heavy-handed with the salt."}
{"text":"My mom and I were in Cleveland on business and were staying in Beachwood for the night.  I got on Yelp to find somewhere local and \"ethnic\" for dinner and Anatolia's reviews were great, so we decided to check it out.

The food was FANTASTIC!  The doner kebab was probably the best I've ever had, and the dish I had (it was ground lamb inside of egg plant) was wonderful.  We had baba ghanoush for an appetizer and it was so amazing I could have just eaten that.  We were stuffed, but couldn't resist some desert, so we took some back the hotel, and it was also great.  I drank rosehips tea which was unlike any other tea I'd ever had.

The interior was very nice and cozy, and the staff was helpful and quite pleasant.  I thought for the price it was definitely a good deal!

The next time I'm in Cleveland, I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Stars: 4

We ordered 2 dishes: skender (Shavarma with yogurt) and Sigara B√∂regi (served with any small salad). The iskender is thinly cut/marinaded lamb over a bed of fried tofu. The sauce they use is really good. Light and brings out the flavor of the lamb. Unfortunately, they did not give you a lot of meat. Im guessing probably 1/4 lb of lamb. 

The Sigara somewhat reminded me of crab rangoons, haha. They are eggroll-shaped-fried-with-cheese-filled-wraps.... Yea, it tasted good, and if you order this dish, you will probably agree that the description above is as close as you are going to get with this dish. Oh, the salad they serve with it is generous in quantity and NO spinach or lettuce (which really just takes up room and makes the salad look big). The salad is cucumber and tomato based. 

Service was excellent. Some reviews suggest otherwise, but we had no problem here.

Why is this rated so high? you HAVE to try this dessert: Kunefe, which is \"baked shredded phyllo doguh with white sweet cheese and butter honey syrup.\" SO GOOD. so good. Crunchy on the outside and sweet in the inside. 

NOTE: This takes 15 minutes to make. Just tell them that you plan on ordering this for dessert as you order the main course.

Very spacious restaurant."}
{"text":"In general, the food taste good. I like the red lentil soup. But the Iskender is not as authentic as it should be. The syrup made the bottom part of the dessert Baklava soft and not crisp enough. I assume it is because they made a lot and put them there, but the dishes are not gone fast. The service is extremely slow. And there were flies inside the restaurant, and it is very annoying when they fly around."}
{"text":"Really cool place, the set up is beautiful.  Has a nice upscale trendy feel to it.  Had the combination platter... everything was amazing (adana, sirloin shish, chicken shish, doner).  However it is a little bit pricier compared to other turkish places which have better food.  Over all this place is great, I would go back again, especially for the sirloin shish and adana."}
{"text":"I loved this place, the service great, the atmosphere elegant and Mediterranean. But the food speak for it's self the Turquish flavors are infused in all their dishes and they transport you to that earthy place of their mother land. AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere here. All of the food I have tried here is delicious but the Iskender is my favorite. It is essentially gyro meat over baked homemade croutons and covered in a tomato based sauce. I find myself thinking about it frequently! I like sitting outside during the summer and near the fireplace in colder seasons. The service has been friendly the times I've eaten here. I would say the price is moderate. It is a good place for many occasions."}
{"text":"probably the best hummus I've ever had. so delicious, I could've eaten just a bowl of it for dinner. that said, I really didn't like the rest of the food. maybe it was the fact that there seemed to be eggplant in everything (and my fault, I underestimated how much I hate this veggie when it's not covered in marinara) but it seemed so overpowering that we could not finish the rest of our food."}
{"text":"Wife and I went in there wine bar to have a drink before dinner and had a strange vibe. The employees were snippy with one another and while we were being waited on our bartender was summoned to the back for a meeting."}
{"text":"Pretty standard (or a little above), I think.  Didn't knock my socks off, and I've been a few times.  But certainly not bad, and I keep going back.  I like the music too."}
{"text":"I showed up at this place with higher expectations I suppose, which might explain my 3-star rating.

So being that the Cleveland area lacks diversity in the ethnic-food scene, I was looking forward to some good authentic Turkish grub for a change. I forgot the name of the dish I ordered, but the mental image remains fresh in my brain: cubes of grilled lamb, an ice-cream scoop of white rice, and a small, almost like a garnish of carrots, green peppers, and onions.  Despite the simple presentation, I mercifully held off yelp-judgement until my first bite. The lamb wasn't bland or dry, that's good. White rice is well, white rice - any asian can tell you that.  And they didn't mess up salting and peppering their sauteed veggies. So the meal was okay, but my mom can make that. What made it Turkish???????? And why did I pay $17 for that?  Forget Whole Foods, I'll go to Giant Eagle and make it myself. I'll even call it Moroccan."}
{"text":"My daughters and I had a terrific lunch here.  I highly recommend the Vegetarian Stew.  The vegetables were not overcooked and the presentation was attractive.  My daughters had the smoked salmon and the chicken kabobs.  I also recommend the Turkish coffee.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but the food is good. Nice menu selection, friendly service, easy going atmosphere. Good place for a date."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. My husband traveled in Turkey a lot in the 90s and loves Turkish food. He had a such fun and even ordered off the menu!"}
{"text":"WOW! I love mediterranean food and this is one of the best! I don't live here but when I come back I will be coming back to Anatolia!!!"}
{"text":"Always good, healthy tasty.   I don't eat red meat.  I LOVE the red lentil soup and the vegetarian combo appetizer for a sampling of humus , baba, tabouli and other middle eastern salads.   I also love the Turkish red wind called Yakut."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very flavorful. Would definitely recommend. A little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Visit there the first time yesterday. I ordered the lamb adana. It was delicious! The presentation was not extravagant. My fianc√© ordered the chicken saut√©e and really liked it. I tried a bite, it actually tasted a lot like pizza topping. Probably because of the onions and peppers. 
The waiter was not very attentive to us. Not sure if it was a one time thing or the time of the day? We walked their from home 5 PM on a Friday.
In any case, this is a restaurant that I will visit again."}
{"text":"The hidden gem here is the Lamb Shank. It's only available as a special and boy does that thing sell fast. I usually call ahead to see if it's on the menu... Because they have ran out the several times I've been here."}
{"text":"My first time in a Turkish restaurant. Worth the trip.

I had a very good beef and lamb dish. 

Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Lots of interesting choices. I had an eggplant appetizer with a theoretically spicy tomato sauce; and doner (gyro meat) on croutons with a fresh yogurt. Everything was very pleasant, but just a bit bland to my taste. I also had a Turkish wine (from Anatoly?) for the first time, and thought the same thing - pleasant enough, just not standout. I have no hesitation recommending you try it too."}
{"text":"Between 4 and 3 stars, depending on how broke one is (or not). Nice food, but not to die for or anything like that; incredibly nice people and a great location to sit outside at night, but drastically over-prized (as many things in the allegedly so cheap in reality not cheap city). If you are wealthy and don't mind, one of the best places in the area to go and sit with your friends. However, because the people running it are fantastic and no less, maybe it's worth the money anyways."}
{"text":"In a word. Overpriced. The food was average, there wasn't that much of it for the very large amount I paid. I feel like Anatolia is only doing well because Joe's in rocky river hasn't opened an East side location yet. I've had better middle eastern food for less money at a ton of other places. I would also recommend Simply Greek over this in a heartbeat. Not as nice of an atmosphere but a much better deal with definite menu overlaps."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and loved it both times. The service is great and the food is delicious with just the right portion. I loved the Beef stir fry dish they have. Also, if you get their hummus, drip some olive oil on it! And, be sure to get a cup of Turkish Coffee without sugar or cream..absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"I enjoy walking over for take out or stopping in for a drink.  
If I didn't live within walking distance, would I seek Anatolia out.  Yeah, totally.

The hummus and pita are out of this world.  Doner is delicious and the steak kabobs are also wonderful.  Not many, but huge chunks of meat.

It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Maybe its because we Un-Lucked out and got a mediocre waiter, but I thought this place was just so so overall.  The wine and beer prices were pretty high, I think it was like $6 for their cheapest decent red... and the beers are all $4 or more except for like Miller lite or whatever.  Our waiter seemed somewhat indifferent, and only came by twice... but perhaps that was just a bad weekend for him.  The patio was really nice, and the location is cool in a nice part of Lee road.  The food was Good, but not amazing.  The olives we got were nothing extraordinary, and Tabouli was good."}
{"text":"Ordered the mixed grill and Chicken was amazing. All the food had amazing flavor. Ordered the kanafa dessert but was upset because it's suppose to come with ice cream and they were out. Overall everything was great staff was great"}
{"text":"Anatolia is a classy but cozy restaurant near Cedar Lee intersection.  Their lamb dishes are awesome.  I usually get the adana kabab but the okra lamb dish is very good.  There falafel is also well executed.  Most entrees are around 15$.  Their baklava is fantastic also.  I'm not a big fan of their pita but have liked everything else."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group on a Tuesday night. We had several appetizers, plus entrees all around. The apps we got were the large sampler plate, which had stuffed grape leaves, hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli, a bean dish, a yogurt dip and another saucy thing I couldn't identify. Everything was delicious. The bean dish was a bit bland, but I think it could just be that after the bright seasonings of the other items, perhaps the beans just weren't as seasoned. Don't get me wrong: they were still quite good. We also got the falafel, which was excellent: nicely crispy on the outside. Someone in our group got the sauteed liver cubes. Normally I despise liver, but since I'm an adventurous soul, I decided to try a couple. I was really impressed! It wasn't something I would order (or make) for myself, but if, say, I was a guest at someone's house and they served it, I would eat it. I'm pretty sure it was veal liver, so it was much more mild-tasting than beef liver. 

Our waiter, whose name I forget but I think it started with a Y, was wonderful! I instantly felt like I was a guest in his home. He is probably the best waiter I have ever had anywhere, and I've eaten out a lot in my 48 years. He brought us another appetizer the name of which I forget, but it sounded like \"cigar.\" It actually was shaped like cigars, but tasted nothing like them! They were phyllo dough (I think) filled with a mild cheesy kind of filling. Delicious! The kicker was that he said that he thought we'd like them, but if it turned out we didn't, he wouldn't charge us for them. Well, we did, and I'm not even sure we got charged for them. I can't guarantee he'd do that for everyone, of course, but he was just that awesome. He also kept the pita bread constantly stocked. 

On to the entrees: I had a combination platter of kofta and chicken adana, which came with a rice pilaf and red cabbage salad. The portions were a little smaller than I was expecting, but honestly, I could do with smaller portions. Plus, we were already stuffed from the appetizers. The kofta was a bit dry, but I've had it before and it was also dry, so I think that's how it's supposed to be. Both the kofta and the chicken were tender enough to cut with my fork, and both were delicious. Well seasoned, but not spicy (though I like spicy food), and just very interesting flavors if you're used to standard American fare. My wife generally doesn't like Mediterranean food, and even she thought it was some of the best she's ever had. 

TL;dr version: Unparalleled service, wonderful food, great atmosphere. We want to go back and sit on the patio (hopefully before winter!)."}
{"text":"First off I loved my server. She was a very pleasant girl from Russia that was a pleasure to talk to about coming to Cleveland.

Second off the owner (I assume) was on hand at all times to make sure dishes were out on time, people were seated, and very involved. From a servers standpoint this could be intimidating but from the customer's point of view it was good to feel taken care of.

We ate outside and loved the space. Lee Road is a great location and this is important! I saw the old location and it just seemed less appealing. This was far from the case on Lee. 

The food was wonderfully spiced and featured veggies like okra. I never knew I was such an okra fan. Well I tell you...yumm! I like the feeling of a light yet fulfilling and healthy dish for especially the summer. On the flip side the warmth of the spices and the heartiness of the sauces make the food pleasurable for even the cooler months.

I have already recommended this new location to my friends and as a lover of Yelp friendship I am recommending it to you as well. Eat on!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and bad.
Gin martini ordered with a twist came without the twist. 
The appetizer platter with ca. 7 different appetizers came with 2 spoons to serve them. 
The fried feta cheese rolls tasted oddly sharp - almost like blue cheese. 
The fish special was sent back by one of our party and our combo order of steak, grilled chicken and chicken Adana got mixed up and we got twice the filet. 
Now I usually wouldn't complain about extra filet but this one tasted like liver. Maybe it was marinated in some odd concoction? 
On top of that the floor in the ladies room was sticky. 

Two stars because people did seem to enjoy the beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"Hummus and Pita bread as the appetizer, excellent! Main course was the Branzino fish with rice and greens."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for years.  This visit the food was not brought at the same time.  The food was cold. When we told the manager and the owner they did not care about our experience. They have lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. I've been here twice and the waiters never get the order correct. If you cannot remember the order, then write it down! 
My mother in law's meal came out 20 minutes after everyone else's meal. They also never take responsibility for messing up orders. They lie and say they run out of filet mignon, then want to charge us for something we don't want. And when we complain about them charging us, they take it off the bill and don't offer to give us the filet that they did have in the first place. No apologies or complimentary desserts. Never coming back here again. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Anatolia Cafe offers good Turkish food, but the service here is a bit lacking.

When I am here, I always order their eggplant with sauce appetizer. It's a cold mixture of eggplant, peppers, and tangy tomato sauce and goes very well with their pita bread. I always save room for their milk pudding for dessert! It's almost like a large square of creamy, sweet jell-o, topped with cinnamon. It's such a unique, delicious dessert that I've never seen anywhere else.

They have a good lunch deal, which is one appetizer and one entree for $10. I had the tabouli and the shepherd salad, which had tomatoes and cucumbers, and lightly spiced chicken kabobs.

The service here could use some improvement. For example, once when I was here with a friend,she ordered the doner, but the waitress rolled her eyes and sighed. When she asked the waitress what was wrong, she said that the doner is street food and there were better options on the menu. I have never heard a waitress undersell a dish, especially the one that the menu itself boasts is the \"best in town!\" It was very discouraging! When I was here even more recently, a friend and I were seated and waited several minutes before the waiter came. When he approached over our table, he asked, \"Are you guys ready because I want to get your order in before I move on to that table over there\" and pointed to a group of four just about to sit down. He didn't greet us and he didn't smile. 

My conclusion: Their food is pretty good, but perhaps not as tasty as other Mediterranean restaurants around town, and the service is quite disappointing. I wouldn't choose to come to this place myself, but I don't turn it down when a friend is craving it."}
{"text":"After walking down Lee with my parents (in town from California) in search of somewhere to eat, we finally settled on Anatolia Cafe. I've not had a lot of Turkish food before, but I have had a lot of Lebanese and Greek food, and it is a bit similar.

The atmosphere is dressy casual, they have linens and sell wine, but was family friendly (having a highchair is a plus). There is also a nice sized outdoor patio.

I ordered the falafel dinner with mixed greens salad, and my mom got the chicken saute. The food was all good. The falafel was some of the best I've had, it was flavorful and not dry at all. 

The prices were standard for dinner entrees, about $12 - $14 a person. The portions were large enough that I was able to share easily with my one year old (who eats anything and everything), but not so large as to have leftovers."}
{"text":"If I ever criticize the places I dine, it's only because of restaurants like Anatolia that spoiled me with their exquisite deliciousness. The place simply radiates cultural warmth: impeccable service and amazing food. My personal favorite is chicken Adana with yogurt ( zesty, melting in your mouth kinda deal) and roasted eggplant as an appetizer. And even if a Russian approves of the eggplant ( Russian cuisine is all about it), it means the Chef is doing something right in the kitchen. I heard a lot of good things about their Kebabs and absolutely love their Turkish coffee and deserts. I've been there many times and not once did I regret the distance I traveled - West side just does not have the equivalent of the place.
The coffee and appetizers are not huge, but neither they are supposed to be that - everything outside of US is kinda smaller and tastier; comes with a distance, sorry.
So if you want a little romance and culture in your life, just have yourself some magnificent dish on the Anatolia's patio - the air is saturated with the smell of delicious roasts and daring promises ( everybody on the East side and their mother are on the date at Anatolia on Saturday or Sunday, trust me)."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Anatolia from a bunch of friends and finally got to try it last Saturday for dinner.  We were able to get a patio table for our small group of 5.  The patio was pretty packed since it was such a nice day out.  

First off, the food was great. We shared the Mixed appetizer so we could try everything.  The hummus and tabouleh were reaaaally good.  I got the Beef Saute which was tasty and a pretty large portion.  I tried someones Chicken Shish which was also good, the chicken was moist and not overcooked.  

As much as we liked the food, the service was lacking that night.  When we first got there, our waiter was telling us drink specials for happy hour and then said \"Actually, if it's after 7 there are no more specials.\"  It was close to 9 already. Whoops.  After looking at the drink menu we also noticed that happy hour drink specials are only Mon-Thurs...and it was a Saturday.  Another whoops.  He didn't seem too familiar with the menu when he asked him about the appetizers.  He was also not very attentive and we had to wave him down whenever we wanted something.  At this point we asked if he was new and he said \"Yes fairly new, about 1 month.\"  Okay, we decide to cut him some slack.  We finally ask for the check and some boxes.  After giving him our cards and cash, another waiter came by asking us again what we wanted to do and was confused about the concept of charging the cards with X amount first and using the cash second.  My friend mentioned they may have been worried we weren't going to tip but they shouldn't presume.  Sadly it didn't end there, the next day when I excitedly went to the fridge to get my leftovers I found that he gave me the wrong leftovers.  Not only did he give me the extra appetizers but he had put the pita bread to go with it in another bag that I presume was my leftovers.  :(  

If I could give 3.5 stars I would because I liked the food, but the service was pretty terrible.  I'll probably go back and cross my fingers the bad service was just a one time thing... I'll keep you updated."}
{"text":"Always good! Consistent and delicious. The mixed grill is big enough to split, the hummus is of course amazing.  But really, it's the lamb you go for. That's why this place is better than Taza in my book."}
{"text":"My favorite Turkish restaurant in Cleveland. There is ample seating, the place is spacious and the ambience is nice. The staff is friendly, they also have free valet parking, definitely a plus in the winter. I ordered the Vegetable Stew and it was delicious - authentic similar to what I had in Istanbul. They also have Ayran - it was refreshing. The baklava was rich. The bread is super - freshly made, fluffy and warm. Overall 4 stars! Highly recommended if you are looking for Turkish food in CLE."}
{"text":"Anatolia is on my restaurant rotation list. Food has always been good. It always feels like they are understaffed, but that may be due to the configuration of the space. The tables they are in charge of are not constantly in their peripheral. 

There is parking in the back. We've never had to park on the street over the years. Restaurant has walls of windows, making it very bright, which I love.

Here are dishes we frequently order:

- cold appetizer combo: good for those to try different cold appetizers in smaller doses. In the end we knew we just love baba ganoosh.

- baba ganoosh. Ask for whole wheat bread (each table gets a basket) to go with it. You can see the eggplants. Very light. We order it every time. 

- Turkish tea: is a kind of black tea. Strong, fragrant. 

- combo of two meats, kefte, donor, filet mignon, chicken. Comes with plain white rice, cabbage salad, and cucumber yogurt. The cabbage and yogurt are great balance against the meat; tangy, tad sweet, cooling. Health-conscious folks should probably go with visible meat, eg beef mignon, chicken cubes, rather than ground meat, eg donor, kefte. I like it, simple, straight forward, healthful.

- lamb okra: for a period of time I was obsessed with it; had to order it every time. There's something about the tomato-butter sauce. I eventually got tired of it because I feel the sauce has too much butter than tomato to my liking. Feel heavy afterwards. 

- lamb shank: today is my first time ordering it, because it's not on the menu. It's not the lamb chops, which are on the menu. Lamb shank are offered in limited quantities. Today they only made 3 orders. It was braised for 3-4 hours; soft, not gamy at all. Similar sauce as in lamb okra, perhaps less butter. Pretty good.

- yogurt kebab dishes: they have a series of Adana/kebab which essentially all have pita crouton underneath meat with yogurt sauce. I love it. The tomato sauce tastes similar as above. I think they use the same tomato base throughout different dishes.

- liver cube hot appetizer: it's rare to see liver on a restaurant menu. I liked it. Big portion for an appetizer. 

- all their Turkish desserts are great: 
  If you want crispy: baklava; kunefe, kadayif (see other yelpers photos, texture on top reminds me of bird's nest) interesting texture.
  If you want soft: Kazandibi (the menu says milk pudding, but it's not liquid-y. It's rolled up, kind of like a pillow. Try it.), sutlac (rice pudding)

--- warning, un-appetizing scene below ---
Today after we finished the meal, as we were signing the check, we noticed the whole wall of the windows was covered in some type of flying insects. We mentioned it to our server when came to collect the check. He literally said \"oh sh*t! Let me tell manager\". The manager came, the two of them, plus us customers, are all in awe. For a blink second I felt like we were in a disaster movie. God sends swarms of flies to warn you of the flood coming. The manager decided to vacuum them and quickly acted on it. This is the first time in years we've ever experienced it, and the staff acted on it promptly, so I don't fault them on this one."}
{"text":"Since when are martinis a quarter second pour on the vodka?! Apparently, Happy Hour is only happy for the house. Food is good. Drinks are G-rated at best. A Shirley Temple is stronger than one of their mixed drinks. They should have their liquor license revoked."}
{"text":"The food here is great and we used to dine here regularly, but we won't be back again. Unfortunately, the management is deplorably rude, unprofessional and exceptionally cheap.

This afternoon, our waiter made an error and brought out four desserts when we only ordered two. When we asked him that we only wanted two and requested that he take  take two back, he said his manager would not allow this, since the desserts were \"custom made\". 

The manager emerged & said that the owner gave her express orders over the phone that she cannot make the adjustment and that we had to pay for all four desserts. I asked her if she was forcing me to pay for and take 2 desserts that I didn't want. To this she replied \"you have to pay for them but you can throw the desserts away if you want\". 

Never before have I encountered such a classless, rude manager at a restaurant. She shouldn't be answering phones there, much less managing it. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Great decor. Quiet and spacious. Lots of variety and attentive service. Had the salmon and it was delicious. So glad I stopped. Nice wine list also."}
{"text":"Anatolia's is one of our go to spots, whether it's a nice night out on the patio during the summer, dining indoors during a cold winter night, or even take out when we want a night in. You can't go wrong with anything you order and everything is made with fresh ingredients.

The hummus is homemade and one of the best you've had- ask for their homemade hot sauce on the side to mix in and make it even better! The babagannush is also really good- smooth and creamy with a hint of smoked flavor. You can't get enough of their warm pita...I find my self eating them until they're gone, even after the dips have been eaten! Get the appetizer sampler for a taste of most of the apps when you can't decide which ones you want- they are all equally delicious.

Chicken saute is my regular order, which the stuffed eggplant as a close second. Each entree comes with a side of rice and pickled purple cabbage/carrot slaw. Take my advice and get the bulgar instead of the plain white rice. The bulgar is not only healthier, but it's got added flavor (tomato based?), which I love just on its own. I also really like the slaw and would order it as a 

Oh, and how can I forget the Shepherd Salad?! Full of freshly diced tomatoes and cucumber, with some green peppers and onions diced in, dressed in a light olive oil vinaigrette, it's so refreshing-especially in the summer. Big enough for 2 to share.

If you're craving Middle Eastern on the East side, this is your go to place!"}
{"text":"I stopped in while I was strolling around Lee Road and was completely taken by surprise. I had the chocolate mousse and it was amazing."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I had several appetizers and a wonderful falafel as main course. They have the best baklavas in town, so be sure to save some space for dessert. They pair really well with Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"We did take out for 6 of us. Very good grape leaves, falafel and the kebabs were tender and nice portions. The dish, don't know what's it called, with beans and tomato's was really good."}
{"text":"The Good:  Most of the food was great and it was lovely to be able to sit on the patio as it was a warm evening.
The Not So Good:  The salad was advertised as having olives but there were no olives.  When I asked for olives, he brought olive oil.  Eventually I got the olives.  I ordered salmon and it was way overcooked and dry as dry.
The service was very slow.  The entree arrived and the appetizer plates were still on the table.  The table was too small for five people and we ended up having to put things on the ground.   The lack of service and taking care to remove the plates was awkward and marred a great night out with family."}
{"text":"My husband, brother and sister in law and I went here tonight and let me just say.... Everything was so perfectly delicious!! Everything from start to finish! 

You MUST GO!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. First of all the place is so clean and the ambiance is just perfect, perfectly well lit and so well decorated. We went on a Monday night and the place was pretty busy. You know it is going to be a good place if you are in Cleveland and there are actual customers in the establishment. The staff was very attentive. The hostess greeted us and sat us right away. 
The menu was so extensive and a bit overwhelming. I wanted to try everything that they had. Both my friend and I had the lentil soup. It was so good. Really big portions tho. In a way i wish i had not eaten it because there was so much food and i had no room for the real food. The owner came to greet us and asked what dishes I preferred. After finding out I like eggplant he suggested I try the stuffed eggplant. I was hoping it would be as good as the one my mother makes. Thank god my mom doesnt yelp because she will disown me for saying this but I can easily say it was better. It was so tender and so well seasoned. Just melted in my mouth. Could also be that I am a sucker for eggplant. There was rice and yogurt on the plate as well but i dont eat rice so i never tried it. My friend got steak wrapped around in a tortilla like wrap. It came with yogurt and this purple looking rice. I thought the steak was pretty flavorful and i dont usually care for meat. We both loved it. 
I was in so much pain from the food but i finished everything (except for the rice) because I couldn't leave it on the plate. Would have been a waste of great food.
To top it off the owner liked us so much that he sent over a traditional Turkish dessert called kadaif. I couldn't refuse. It was so delicious. It is shredded like dough that covered this sweet cheese. It also is sprinkled with pistachios.I asked the server but he didn't know what kind of cheese it was. 
I live in Chicago otherwise I would move in and eat their food all the time :). Try the place out and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Anatolia, ANATOLIA AGAIN! (Sorry.) When it comes to Mediterranean cuisine, I am a typical clueless white guy who has occasionally had a gyro and considers himself \"cultured.\" So I thought I was a bit in over my head when a couple friends suggested we hit this place. I honestly don't remember the names of anything we got other than the pita and hummus appetizer, but it was all spectacularly delicious. (If every place's hummus was this good, I would be a happier man.) The lamb thing-a-ma-jig I got with rice side and a cold can of peach soda was fantastic. Multiple entrees were shared and everybody left happy and full."}
{"text":"I can only rate their happy hour, which had half off certain appetizers, $3 select beers, $4 house wines, $5 select mixed drinks, $5 wraps (choice of doner - gyro meat, chicken, or falafel)

Their happy hour options were alright. I think if the appetizers were not half priced, it would have been wayy too overpriced for what we got. My friend and I tried the tabouli (cracked wheat salad with various minced herbs and peppers) and the babagannush (mashed eggplant dip) for appetizers, which came with pita. 

The doner wraps came with a yogurt dip - I asked for turkish hot sauce and that was a good combo, although the wrap wasa little dry on its own. 

Their house white wine was quite delicious. Ambience was relaxing on a weekday afternoon. It's a rather large restaurant and it has outdoor seatings. 

What were the stars of the meals were the desserts. We had the baklava and the kadayif. I'd never had the kadayif before but i'm so glad I decided to try something new. Both were really good but the kadayif was perfection - not as sweet as the baklava, which I felt needed some tea to balance the sweetness. Definitely recommend trying that out!!"}
{"text":"So glad we were able to check out their spacious and beautifully decorated new location on our recent trip to Cleveland.  Food as good as ever!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant and good food. The place is busy on weekends. The food is good and semi-authentic. E service vary from one visit to another."}
{"text":"Hmmm...How can I start this.
Well first,I'll start by saying the food was delicious.
Even though the waitress gave two people in our party the wrong dinners.
The service was SLOW & UNFRIENDLY!!!
She was new obviously,never smiled,very uninformative 
regarding the menu.Owner of the resteraunt was cold,stoic &

very unproffesional.I will not be going back EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"eating here made me think only one thing: WHAT DIDN'T I COME HERE SOONER?!?!??!! I came for lunch, and we all got the lunch combos, amazing deals. and I mean amazing. Soup or salad and an entree for like $10? Can't beat that. I had the chicken soup which was wonderful, and my mom had the lentil soup, which was phenomenal. Best lentil soup I've ever had (except for my bf's moms!). My boyfriend and I split the stuffed cabbage (which I am literally drooling over just thinking about) and the chicken shish, which was juicy, flavorful, and came with a great yogurt sauce. if you haven't been here yet, get to steppin!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for a nightcap after an evening out. The service was excellent as was the atmosphere. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic cocktail or for a small group of friends. We're looking forward to experiencing the dining portion of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is SO delicious!! Every item we got we loved! I do have to say the doner entree was a plus plus plus for us! We ordered it and then reordered it! We all loved it! The bread was nice and soft as well! Rice was good too!! Def will be back! Staff was polite and attentive. Restaurant is nicely decorated. Parking is near by as well."}
{"text":"Anatolia Cafe is my favorite place to go to for Mediterranean food on the east side of Cleveland.  It's a restaurant that I frequently visit and recommend to my friends.

The doner (slices of beef and lamb) is advertised on the menu to be the best in town.  I haven't tried all of the doner in Cleveland, but of the ones I've tried, it is my favorite.  I've ordered this dish the most when I go to Anatolia.  I've recommended this dish to five of my friends, and they've all agreed that this dish is really good.   Delicious and not gamy.

The other meats are good.  The doner is the best, but the filet mignon cubes in the beef saute are also worth a try.  In my opinion, the portions are medium sized.  They are reasonable, but if I am going to dinner hungry, I need to also order an appetizer to be completely full.   I would recommend one of the cold dips - I've tried and liked the hummus, baba ghanouj, and the eggplant with sauce."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Good food. But they are on the expensive side... hummus and pita should definitely be on the house like it is in most middle eastern restaurants."}
{"text":"Dropped in for late lunch. Excellent entrees from the grilled chicken to the kofte. Good service to boot. It wasn't busy but it has a large number of tables."}
{"text":"The place has a great ambiance but that's about it! Our waiter was a pompous, rude jerk. The food is mediocre at best & they don't even serve real Turkish bread which is some of the best in the world! Compared to the Turkish places in Chicago, in Andersonville,  that I've eaten at, it's a bad culinary joke. Just another greedy smuck owner praying on the inquisitive mid-western public!!  It's very sad because Turkish cuisine is some of the best in the world also, if it's done right! The owner should be ashamed of himself for being such a bad ambassador to his country!"}
{"text":"At first when I sat in Anatolia cafe, I thought I had interrupted an Italian Mafia meeting, I mean these dudes were passing around whole bottles of liquor and it was just this guys 37th birthday. I'd love to party with those guys. Anyway, they seemed really satisfied with everything so I figured right away I was in for a treat. Our server came out and had Turkish beer on our table before I even knew what was happening. We also got these little cheese and spinach stuffed puff pastry thing that blew my mind. I forgot what they're called, sorry Anatolia. Then we ordered our entrees, I pointed at what I wanted and our server who might also be my soulmate told me he was going to give me the better version of the dish and my God was it good. So get the D√∂ner but like the special way they make it. They'll know what you're talking about. Then we were briefly asked if we wanted dessert, but it wasn't like they asked us it was more like they were telling us that we were going to get dessert and it was going to be amazing or they'd pay for it. Needless to say, they did not pay for it. This dessert was so good it was basically therapeutic. I felt the dark caverns of my soul brighten with life and happiness when I ate this dessert. 

Dinner was so good at Anatolia that I felt like a better person afterwards, in fact I've reconnected with old friends since then just to find more people to go to Anatolia with. Enjoy y'all.

Also if you're the waiter that served me that dessert and happen to be single, hit me up seriously."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood places. And I love it that a Turkish place counts as a neighborhood place in my neighborhood. (Redundant, I know).

Service is impeccable, and the food is pretty amazing. All the doner dishes are delightful. 

Try a can of the sour cherry juice. Yum."}
{"text":"Flavorful dishes arrive quickly accompanied by bottomless tea."}
{"text":"We had reservations here Friday night.  There is a nice patio area, however, we sat inside.  Our server (Nick) was very attentive and did a fantastic job.  We had sour cherry juice, beer, and I ordered the French martini, which was perfect.  We ordered two appetizers: stuffed grape leaves and sigara b√∂regi (pastry filled with cheese and herbs).  The grape leaves (yaprak sarma) were fantastic, less tangy than any Greek ones I've had.  The pine nuts really added a nice flavor.
For entrees, we selected d√∂ner (really delicious), the chicken okra dish, and the filet mignon shish kebab.  The filet was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, and it was delicately seasoned.  Bismati rice, red cabbage vinaigrette and pita came with our food.
We were all very happy with our selections.  I was feeling sorta hard to impress, but this place was fantastic.  It was a very nice place to celebrate my birthday.  The atmosphere was great, service was flawless, food was perfect and the prices were reasonable.  This meal was a lot better than what I had at Rokefeller's and Nighttown.  Seriously, try it!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! But the service was disappointing.

For an appetizer, I had the stuffed grape leaves then falafel with a side of the white bean salad for my dinner. DELICIOUS!! Everything tasted very fresh. I want to go back to try some desserts (I love desserts!). But the service was a different story. We got there around 8:30pm on a Monday night. The hostess never said 'hello' or smiled, just asked how many and took us to a booth. Then the waitress came, never smiled, very blunt and hovered over us. I like to chit chat and feel comfortable, that did not happen at Anatolia Caf√©. 

I will go back at least one more time."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Best kebab in town, very nice and professional servers, reasonable price. You can find very uniq beers there so as vines. They also have best baklava that I've ever tried"}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's birthday. He got the lamb shank and I got the saut√©ed chicken. We got the fries as a side dish. He loved the lamb and the chicken was done very nicely, though I would've liked a bit of spice. We got the kunefe for dessert and I quite liked it. The service was quick and ambience nice. Overall a solid place if you're in the mood for Turkish cuisine."}
{"text":"The Turkish food is famous because of its great taste. So, if a restaurant offers Turkish food, the food is expected to taste great. Tasting great should not be considered above standards, it is the regular expectation. This restaurant is doing this just right. If the food does not taste as it should, then that is a reason for low rating.

The prices at this place are too high. They can be easily lower, but it looks like the management never gets satisfied with what they are charging. They want more and more and more. 

On the other hand, the portions are as small as possible. When you go to dinner at a restaurant and choose an entree for $12 or so, you end up with leftovers. The case at Anatolia Cafe is opposite. You end up with ordering one more portion after you finish your first order. 

The price of a great rice is $1 per pound or less in the grocery stores. But, the amount of rice they give in a portion may cost only 2 cents as. You cannot be more stingy than this. If you are robbing your customer, at least, you should let them find enough food on their plate. 

Our waitress was not aware enough about what she is serving. She was probably new, but she was rude, as if she knew the food better than the person from this culture. How can the management allow a person to serve in this restaurant, who is rolling her eyes towards the ceiling when customer asks a question? This is how you tell your customer that he/she is stupid. I am not there to be graded fro my thinking skills. But, you are there to serve to your customer.

6 oz tea = $2.50.
You get 24 oz coffee for this at most famous coffee shop.

A small portion of desert = $8. You can buy a whole cheesecake or 3 pounds of ice-cream for that price.

They also sell preserve and ask $7 for an 8 oz jar, while the same preserves are available for $2 at ethnic grocery stores.

The pure boneless fatless lamb is $5 per pound, but you get 6 oz gyro for $15.

I do not care about the ambiance, and this restaurant does not care about the customer. All they care is customer's money. 

$30 for a simple entry and desert makes me say, never again."}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern restaurants in the Cleveland area. Their lamb dishes just melt in your mouth, and their chicken dishes are well seasoned. Their hummus is spot on, and they have really good stuffed grape leaves."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at Anatolia and would be back to try more food.  The menu had a good selection of items that included vegetarian and seafood options. 

The falafel appetizer I had was good.  I enjoyed the tzatziki sauce and the pita it came with.  I had the combination plate with filet mignon shish kebab, and d√∂ner.  I loved the filet mignon.  I almost wish that was all I got because it was so tender and seasoned to perfection.  The d√∂ner was really good too, but after having the filet mignon, I forgot about it.  

I didn't like that the cups were upside down on the table before we sat down, so I felt the need to ask for a straw.  Also, the dish my coworker got (stuffed egplant), was bland a mushy.  We asked the waiter for the one dish you would recommend to a newcomer that would get him/her hooked, and that's that he recomended.  The flavors and the textures were one note: babyfood.  I'm sorry my coworker's food wasn't as good as mine, because while I would come back, he assured me that he wouldn't want to give this place a second chance.

One last note: the parking lot out back is cramped, but at least there is a non street parking option."}
{"text":"This place is really great!  We started with falafel which was great, then I had the Doner and Lamb Adana combination and it was amazing!  End with the baklava and you've had a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"We went here after a rather stressful day and left feeling relaxed and well-fed. Great food and a welcoming ambience.  They also had a surprisingly interesting wine list. Overall, a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Here's the situation... this place is located right down the road from my house which means I walk past it non-stop and the smell of the freshly baking pita lures me in and commands me to order one of the many Turkish delights that they offer.  This wouldn't be a problem if I had any self control, but I don't. I can not get enough of their    fried feta (no clue what the true menu name is) or the absolutely delicious Peasant Salad. The dressing on the salad is house made and wickedly scrumptious. 

This is also the place I tend to frequent when I am on a bit of a diet or trying to avoid eating meat. There is always a healthy vegetarian option on the menu that is going to   be filling and flavorful. That being said, the meats here are so perfectly seasoned and served! The chicken is always juicy and he filet is the right temperature. 

The dining room is gorgeous and the wine bar within is a great spot to chill. The prices can get a bit high, but the quality and freshness out way the  expense. If you are seeking a meal that is a bit on the extraordinary side, this is a great spot. The servers are always friendly and the service is always efficient. 

Overall great place!"}
{"text":"This place in general is on the pricey side. The restaurant is kinda small too, but not as busy as other places. I ordered stuffed eggplant and I was really happy with my food. Some of my other friends were feeling pretty meh about their dishes. You should also try their turkish coffee - it's a really thick kind, with some sandy texture. I haven't actually tried it but my friend seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"My first time here in Cleveland and I thought I should try something that is totally off the beaten path! because, I doubt I am ever coming back here again and second, I usually don't get off the \"beaten path\"! With that, Anatolia Cafe at Cleveland Heights was the one I chose. And my God, did I make the right choice!
The food was how it should be served in The heartland of Turkey but lucky us, they are right here in Cleveland, OH!  We had the Iskender Doner Kebab, and the Mixed Grill and I can vouch for the authenticity of them being how you would have it in Turkey, Just perfect.
For those who are lucky to be living in Cleveland, you are missing out on a jewel of an eatery if you haven't been here already. And, if you are passing by this town like I am, I recommend you give this place a chance. Food and the service that comes with it is just worth a try. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food and service is good. I recommend the platter of appetizers and the apple tea."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, my favorite are chicken Adana and for sweets, nothing beats the warm kunafa mmm"}
{"text":"Ordered through a home delivery service 
They sent the incorrect order, and what they sent was poorly packed and grossly inadequate.
2 pieces of kebab for $16!!
When we called about their error they refused to correct their mistake and instead offered us a free meal when/if we ever went to their restaurant, which will be never."}
{"text":"I can't understand why people like the food here so much.  I've been there twice and it was very bland.  I asked for my food spicy and it was less than mild.  I've had better Kebabs a sixth of the price of theirs.  The ambience is nice but other than that......"}
{"text":"Very authentic, amazing taste and food variety.
Highly tecommended items:
Stuffed cabbage, lamb okra and for dessert Kunefe."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Turkish Restaurant, I love the combination starter and the stuffed eggplant."}
{"text":"This spot marked my first patio dinner of 2013. I don't remember from last year if they had valet on Thursdays or not, but this Thursday they did not. I found a spot on a side street around the corner not too terribly far away. The patio was pretty busy - busier than the inside. Our waitress was pleasant, but reserved, and she was very busy - I saw her working in all sections of the patio. Perhaps the unexpected nice day messed up their staffing plans. In any event the food was good. I got the 'eggplant with sauce' appetizer - I don't recall the menu mentioning it was a chilled dish which would have been nice as it surprised me. It was still good though and fairly flavorful. I had not been here for awhile so it was good to get that Turkish flavour again. For my main I tried something I had never had before and enjoyed it. It was the D√∂ner (Shavarma) and was a very generous serving of thinly sliced meat. Dessert was good. I got a standard - rice pudding. I will mention though that the dessert menu could use some design and editing help - the arrangement of the pictures doesn't really help one figure out what things are."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! Great middle-eastern food; warm, attentive, friendly service; great ambience, reasonably-priced. 

My wife and I eat here perhaps 2-5 times per month, and it is our first choice when we dine out (and we live about 10 blocks away).  We've been here with a wide variety of friends and family, and everyone seems to love it. Never a single dissatisfied diner in our groups. 

Large menu with ample options for almost any type of diet or preference - tho solidly middle-eastern, which goes without saying. We often sit at the comfortable full-service bar and share appetizers and small plates (great selection - hummus is terrific, as are the stuffed grape leaves and the white bean salad) and have beers or wine (they have a decent selection of, and high quality options for, both)."}
{"text":"This place's meat was very very good. We got to sit outside which was nice. Our waitress was SUPER friendly and accommodating. We had a big group of about 12 people and they handled us very nicely. I had the chicken shish kabob and it was INCREDIBLE. The chicken was so moist and flavorable. Seriously best chicken I have ever had. My dad had the filet mignon and it was amazing. It was so soft my dad cut it with a fork. They're hummus was super good here also, I dont like eating hummus outside of my hummus cause no one really makes it the same. But was really good here, I loved it. Everyone at our table really enjoyed their food. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves good Middle Eastern/ Turkish food."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and always get the Iskender \"must try\" kabob. It is so delicious. They also have really great hummus and other appetizers. Beautiful ambience inside. Service is good, too. French fries (that my daughter gets) are good but used to be better and had a garlic and herb seasoning."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the theater, and the service and the meal was wonderful. I had the lamb chops, simply seasoned and cooked to order. The baba ghanoush (sp?) was wonderfully smoky and the pita fresh and warm."}
{"text":"I had the lamb adana here, which was very good. The sides weren't very creative (white rice and cabbage salad), but the lamb was well seasoned and tender. Good baklava and Turkish tea finish off the experience. I would recommend!

It seems to be in a trendy neighborhood and has a trendy feel. It has also done the very wise move of offering the baked goods at the front of the restaurant/cafe so you can just stop in for a desert or snack to take home."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around.  Got mixed appetizer and baklava...and let's just say they do a lot of varied flavors really well.  Service was courteous and attentive without being in your face."}
{"text":"**I mention the different nationalities because I feel that we were discriminated against, and to help the managers identify who I am talking about**


The restaurant was kind of empty around 4PM

This place did NOT respect our group at all. We were 5, and 3 of us are Arabs, and for some reason all the people/hosts at the front desk did not even bother to look me in the eye while I was talking to them telling them that we need a table for 5 people, it was basically them acting like they do not hear me talking, and that happened when I just stepped into the restaurant, I did nothing at all, so I dont know why they did treat me that way, and after that, the table waiter was even WORSE!! 

Only the American baker/cook actually answered my questions about different types of desserts that they had. Our waiter was RUDE and very disrespectful, we ACTUALLY asked another waiter to take care of us, and that second waiter was kind, and he took care of our food, he sounded like he had a British accent, but I dont know where he is from, so if you recognize this waiter, he deserves your tips, he is a nice guy.

I don't know if we got that treatment because we are Arabs, but it definitely felt like it...it definitely seemed like we were descriminated against, thats the only logical explanation, since ALL we did was sit there, and order food, nothing else. So the bad treatment can only be explained by racism. we were 3 Arabs, 1 Asian, 1 Eastern European. 

Our Asian friend asked for water 3 or 4 times, and the first waiter kept bringing 1 cup of water at a time from the kitchen, and place it in front of someone, but not our Asian friend, he left him WITHOUT water, even though our friend did ask him to bring water for him, that waiter kept going in and out to bring 1 cup of water each time, but he never gave water to the Asian guy.

I will never go back, and I will make sure that everyone I know hears about how they feel about Arab/Asian customers in general, I will recommend that my friends take their family and friends to ANY OTHER restaurant, were they will not be treated that way.

FUNNY FACT: only the NON Turkish employees did treat us in a normal way, but some of the Turkish employees were RUDE and very disrespectful, the hosts at the front (two Turkish looking LADIES, one with black hair) and the waiter (a Turkish GUY with black hair).

The manager (older person) was cool though"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  The beef sautee was extremely tender and juicy.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent grape leaves and hummus/pita. Main entrees are delicious and staff is very friendly/helpful."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  They have really great lunch specials and have a nice patio.  The service is friendly and knowledgeable. 

We also love to order take out as well.  The hummas is amazing, best falafel in the city and the desserts are great as well.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Perfect steak kabobs!
Prompt seating for a Friday night.
Waiter was very attentive and came to check on us several times.
The bread that came with the meal was fresh and delicious and the entrees were both fast and expertly prepared."}
{"text":"Good assortment of delicious food, reasonable price, and good service. Anatolia has a mix of small plates and entrees that tasted fairly authentic. They also have a good cocktail list including drinks with Raki, a local Turkish liquor. Portions were a good size for the price you paid."}
