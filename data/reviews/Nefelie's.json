{"text":"I love the lemon pepper chicken with fried okra and feta spinach. Yum yum yum! I wish it were open more hours."}
{"text":"This is about one of my favorite spots maybe because it's a hidden nook in the heart of uptown . In Order to go to the dining room area , you have to go thru a set of stairs . A little cardio doesn't hurt anyone . I came here with a friend during business lunch hour  , but we have came here before and we loved it !  For lunch it's a little chaotic but service was great . I started off with a side salad with  Greek dressing . Can I say oh my god , the dressing was so so good . It was creamy rich and I want the recipe . My friend had a spinach dip with pita bread and that was delicious . For my entree I had the fish platter and my two sides with mashed potatoes . My entree also came with a set of hush puppies and wonderful jumbo shrimp . I'm a major fan of tartar sauce and this was the best so far . You can really taste when things are house made and fresh . I had to get a Togo box and two cups of extra tarter sauce. The sauce sides are small so that's why I ordered two . The only down side was parking , since located in uptown parking is really hard to find . Other than that it was awesome ."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the atomosphere and menu. Though the menu was limited the meal I had was awesome, the shrimp was seasoned well did not need any sauce and the hushpuppies were GREAT!!! I only wish they had a desert menu...I will definitely put this restaurant in eating rotation...can wait to take my hubby!"}
{"text":"Got out of working an event late night and needed to eat dinner and they were still serving until midnight so I was excited!!   Jackie was great, hands down awesome. She's served us a few times is always nice, laughing and joking around.   We had the pita chips and tzaziki sauce (did I spell that right) and (house) gyro. Both recommended by Jackie. Loved both of them. Serving size was great, for me at least since I'm on \"European\" eating scale. Basically I'm on my balcony this morning finishing the gyro from last night...while my Husky quietly and annoyingly looks at every bite I take. I caved, gave him a little of the meat...and he loved it too!!   Enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Tried Nefelie's for lunch today. DÃ©cor could be described as 'upscale dive' with plants and some corner fire element put in.  I like to judge places based on how well they do the basics. For a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant, I went for the gyro platter. You know how good gyros come out looking like the meat was freshly shaved off the rotisserie? Nefelie's wasn't anything like that - instead it was salted chopped up ground beef. The fried okra was in some cases over-fried and in most cases over-salted. The food was edible but not crave-inducingly savory like other gyros I've had  Service was adequate and we were in and out for our business lunch within an hour. With a wealth of other options in the immediate area, I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's not Greek/Mediterranean. First glance at the \"feta\" cheese on the fries and I said \"What in the devil made me decide to dine here without reading the reviews\"? Dry feta....the dry, powdery stuff you see in the grocery for $3.59 a container. I had the wet, moist & creamy crumbly feta in mind. My cheese people know what I'm talking about! Dirty martini was pink...don't know what that was about. AND no olives in the martini. Who does that? At a \"Greek\" place....no olives? Ok I'm done. It's New Year's Eve.... needed a bite to support my drink intake for the night, so I guess I got what I came for. Waitress was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Food was great. Quiet upstairs seating. Very laid back atmosphere. I would definitely return and eat here again. Perfect location across from the park in the cobblestone alley."}
{"text":"I would have to say I have had a lot of Greek food in my life and this was not even close.  I had the Gyro not sure what meat but it had the spices from every other dish because they were not cleaning the grill of between orders.  Can't say I would go back."}
{"text":"Ambiance is definitely a creaky old dive bar. Probably a soccer league bar at nights (we went for lunch). Nothing special.  The food was good. There were traditional Greek dishes along with items I hadn't thought of. I had a chorizo / grilled chicken sandwich with fried okra. The sandwich was a good and crazy combination and the fried okra was a little under-fried. I went with a friend though and the fries looked fantastic (he confirmed).  The service was a little slow, but the people were nice enough."}
{"text":"Very very good food and ambiance. Service could have been a little better. Our server had a nose ring and only came to the table 1 time after taking our order."}
{"text":"Cutest little place around town. Stopped in one evening and had some drinks and food with my husband. Friendly staff and lovely owners. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I had to down grade my rating after this last visit. I feel as though this place is not going to last long at the fast pace of uptown lunches. Lunch took us over an hour and it was not due to our slow eating. I am hoping they can speed up their service so we do not lose another lunch place!"}
{"text":"Dank. Something's missing. It's flavor in the Gyro. It's cleanliness all over. It's a server who received no training about anything.   Go to any other place that you can see from Nefelie's front door. Anywhere is ten times better."}
{"text":"4.8/5 stars  Came here during lunch when I was visiting Charlotte for a couple days.   The food was really good: 10/10. The service was good too other than a small mix up. The restaurant is nice and small, perfect for individuals or small groups. When we were ordering, I stressed or waiter that I was allergic to dairy and told them to please hold off on any butter or cheese in my meal. He agreed and took our orders.   The food didn't take too long to be ready, which was great. Once we got our food, my chicken had some type of cheese sauce on layered over it. I told the waiter and he gave me a new plate of food, while letting me keep the old one. I let my brother have the one with cheese. Our waiter was super nice and handled the situation very well.   I ordered the lemon chicken with fries and okra. Best lemon chicken I've had in a while. It wasn't to sour or salty. It was also very juicy and not dry. Too that off with the veggies and crispy French fries: it was a delicious meal. The portions were great as well. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are so friendly and actually came to talk with my friends and I. Love their gyro"}
{"text":"Came here on a birthday bar crawl. My buddy ordered lemon drop shots as it was the daily special. Uh, just adding lemon juice to vodka doesn't make it a lemon drop IMO. No sugared rim, no lemon wedge and Pearl vodka...no thanks!"}
{"text":"You want some food with your salt?  This place is hidden, cozy atmosphere, really polite staff, but ultimately we go for the food, right? I tried the beef/lamb gyro 2x. The meat was tasty, but overloaded on the salt. The sides were also very salty.  I feel like I gave it 2 shots and that was my limit because the salt was on overload.  Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here. This place was empty at lunch which normally is an indicator to just walk right out. But i took my chances and ordered a gyro and fries. See picture for what i got. Looked disgusting and most of the meat was burnt!! Never going there again!"}
{"text":"I got the grilled pork chops with seasoned fries and green beans.  Pork chops had a really good flavor but we're a little tough.  They were thin so maybe a little over cooked but good seasoning.  The green beans looked like something out of a can but I was presently surprised, they had a really good flavor.  The fries also had a good seasoning on them and they were crispy.  Decent lunch spot and pretty consistent.  Casual setting.  Would have given 4 stars if the pork chops weren't as tough.  Would have given 3.5 stars as is, if you could give half stars."}
{"text":"So I finally got to eat at this place! My husband has always talked good things about it so I couldn't wait to try it! It's a casual cozy bar restaurant atmosphere. The menu is not extensive but with good options to choose from. I had the London Broil with roasted potatoes, pita, Marsala sauce and rice and my husband had Lemon Pepper  Chicken with roasted potatoes and fried okra.  The food came out so fast that I was impressed, specially considering that was busy lunch time.   I ordered my steak as medium and I cannot put in words how happy I was when my steak was cooked to perfection!!! Their steak was cooked better than in many fancy steakhouses around the city! The pita was sooooo delicious and those roasted potatoes amazing as well. I poured the Marsala sauce on my rice and it gave a special touch to my meal even though I was supposed to pour it on to my steak.  The lemon pepper chicken is like a explosion of flavors in to your month. However I would give you a tip, if you order it ask them to put the sauce aside so you can pour it as you wish, the sauce can be overwhelming for some people but nothing that would mess up your meal.  The service was pretty good, the food exceeded all my expectations that were high and the price is fair enough!"}
{"text":"Best Long Islands In Town, Hands Down. Onion Rings Are Absolutly Bomb. The Owners Are Really Down To Earth And I Enjoy My Time There Every Visit. I Love The Atmosphere, Upstairs, Down And Front Patio. It's Really Laxed. I'v Introduced Many Co-workers And Friends Here Who Didn't Know About It Initially And They All Loved It And Definitely Will/Have Visited Again And Obviously So Will I."}
{"text":"OK so I've decided that Nefelie's is my FAVORITE place for lunch in Uptown! Being a busy Professional, I just don't have a ton of time for lunch, but Nefelies can serve up a very tasty lunch in a reasonably quick time.   I am puzzled about some of the negative reviews about the service and attitude and all that. I've been here MANY times and have never had a \"bad attitude\" nor bad service. Sure, sometimes they get slammed for lunch so it may take a little longer as the kitchen is small. So it is MY opinion that Nefelies has a GREAT staff, and I am quite discerning when I say that as for me, Service can make or break a place.   And as you may have read in one of my older reviews, they did do some experimenting on the Gyros that I didn't care for. Thankfully they are back to being their old great restaurant and you can't help but like Denise and her \"Mom and Pops\" business.  Speaking of which, Denise told me they are opening up a NEW place on South Blvd and Scaleybark.....this time it will be more of a Deli and Coffee shop and Bakery....and she said that they will be serving alcohol (read Greek Wine - YEAY) and of course one of my all time faves...BAKLAVA! Can't wait to try this new place.  So yes, I am a Champion for this wonderful little hidden gem in the Latta Arcade, and NO, Denise did NOT pay nor bribe me to say this! LOL.....  My tip: Come BEFORE NOON before they get slammed. 1130 is a great time to start your lunch if you can swing it. And whatever you order, get their FRIES or Roasted Potatoes...they are the BEST IN CHARLOTTE!"}
{"text":"So good!! I went in here on a whim bc I wanted a quick takeout lunch and found parking right across the street. I didn't expect much but I was blown away by the quality, flavor, and especially price!! For around $10 I got a deliciously fresh chicken pita, some of he best tzaziki sauce I've ever had, side of homemade ranch (just in case bc I'm picky about my tzaziki) and crispy, perfect fries. I will be returning often to repeat that exact meal...I haven't been able to find much in downtown for the price point that is actually fresh/edible. Do yourself a favor and try this little gem!!"}
{"text":"Nefelie's was a fine place to down a few beers with friends and chow down a decent Greek salad after a long day of working at the track in Charlotte. We were staying downtown, so the location was convenient. The manager was really nice, and offered the idea of a White IPA not yet on the menu that turned out to be delicious! When we were back in Brevard Ct. the following night Nefelie's was closed, which was a bit strange on the big NASCAR race weekend."}
{"text":"This place is probably the worst Greek place I've ever eaten. The good was cold, the ingredients were clearly cheap and un flavorful and  the wait staff was rude and unfriendly.  There are so many better places in charlotte.  Don't waste your money--avoid Nefellies."}
{"text":"This place is located in the uptown/downtown business district next to many of the banks and financial offices. I went here for lunch during on of my visits and ordered the daily special they offered on that particular Monday, the Lemon Chicken Special. Nice size dish that was tasty, fresh, and about average on my taste palate."}
{"text":"I love this place it's a weekly stop on my lunch rotation, the service is always fast and friendly. The food is always tasty and a great value."}
{"text":"The classic gyro is fantastic and they have a courteous staff.  Decent amount of beers on tap.  All-in-all an awesome part of the courtyard.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Not that special... It's hard to believe a place like this could survive being surrounded by the greatness that is Lotta Arcade.  Won't be going back to this greasy spoon anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Boy this has gotta be truly one of my favorite places to eat even tho I've only been here once.  The ambiance, The decor, the architecture all excellent. The food was perfect omg it was soo orgasmic. I was like omg please hold me back from pounding the table with joy ooooooh!! The flounder was cooked with perfectly so sweet so tasty such greatness these cooks must hail from the heavens of cookery.  The drink making skills are off the hook too, best long islands ever, oh joy yeeeeeah.   Food and drinks were of the most excellent quality.  Everyone seems so happy here too , its pretty cool. I really felt comfortable here. Its a real laid back chill , vibe.  Great prices too, freakin excellent.  I had a fireball for hella cheap .   This place is located in the french quarter area where it perfectly fits in . They have upstairs and downstairs seating.  I wanna come back here. This is the type of place you'd wanna travel a distance too just try the food."}
{"text":"I'll continue to stand by my one-star rating... the owner of the restaurant has sent me threatening and derogatory emails, messages with fake Yelp accounts, and now a recent comment here.  One comment said something along the lines of \"You don't know what I'm capable of\", which is exactly why I will continue to warn others from \"dining\" at this establishment.    I think the lesson to be learned in all of this is that while sanitation issues can happen from time to time, the key is recognizing the problem, apologizing and making it right.  Instead, what Nefelie's has done is harass me and told me I am wrong.  This is definitely not the right way to do things as a human being or business owner!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my meals and beverages, the staff are always awesome."}
{"text":"Good peeps..good times!  I stopped by during my walk around the beautiful city of Charlotte and was so excited to meet some super friendly people that could tell me about where I was.  What makes this place great? Well, if I had to categorize it like an 80s-90s show... It is definitely the Cheers of the city. Everybody either 1)knows your name when you arrive or 2) knows your name when you leave.  I was humbled and happy to be invited in to a circle of nice people (even when I said I would be their duchess on Yelp :)   I hope the Halloween party is a success and I would so be there if I was in town! Thanks for making me feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"The gyros were great! I had the side of roasted potatoes but they were very dry and not good. Great service as well! We would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is shitty especially during lunch rush. Environment is very small cramped and the manager/owner was unapologetic for an hour and twenty minute wait for a cheese burger and fries smh"}
{"text":"Gus and the other folks at Nefeli's are WONDERFUL. So friendly, so family oriented, and they know how to party!  The food was fantastic--burgers are absolutely delicous, fries (yum), sweet tea, the whole package. Huge portions.  We stayed for a couple of hours on a Thursday night, had drinks and just a good time. The owners came out and spent some time with us, we will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here before a baseball game with the family. I have to admit one of the worst gyros i have ever had. The gyro meat was awful, cut all up into little tiny pieces like ground beef and burnt. There was no lamb in there at all. The hummus was average, the best part of the meal were the fries. They were out of ice the entire time we were there. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Hands DOWN this is my new favorite lunch place in Uptown Charlotte. I've already been here 4 times in the past week and a half!  The restaurant / bar is located just outside the Latta Arcade on the Church St. side and doesn't have a very prominent sign so you have to walk in a bit. The restaurant itself, like many of its neighbors, is split in two. The bottom floor is a small bar/lounge and can be quite packed in the evenings, bustling with activity. I can't say I know what they offer in the late evenings as far as booze and entertainment is concerned, but I will attest to the AWESOMENESS that is their lunch/dinner menu.   The top floor dining area has a similar chill and somewhat homey contemporary feel as the bottom floor - complete with an artificial fire in the corner! The menu though is far more Mediterranean with Greek salads, pita-based dishes and a variety of enticing and uniquely prepared meat dishes including Gyros. I am currently obsessed with the Lemon Pepper Chicken. I honestly don't know what goes into the SAWCE, but dam is it good. At lunch, you get a nice portion of grilled sliced chicken on a bed of rice with your choice of two sides. For those of you who like to have a lot of choice, I can almost guarantee you that this menu will have at least one thing that you're going to like. I always pick the okra and extra crispy french fries, though you can go healthier with veggies and salad. If you're not into that, then flip the menu over and there are a dozen sandwiches and customizable burgers. They're enormous and taste as good as the entrees. Chorizo and Chicken, sandwiched between ciabatta with lettuce and tomato - you'll need to deal with the food coma after ;)  Appetizers - DELICIOUS! Ranges from spicy wings to gooey artichoke dip to just plain chicken tenders - don't forget the Texas Pete hot sauce they've left for you! I always wanna try something new every time I come here. I won't get bored for awhile. Moreover, they're consistent in their preparation. These cooks know what's up. I haven't been disappointed once with my order.  The lemon pepper chicken and its fellow compatriot entrees can range from $8 - $10, which is a freakin steal in my books. Food comes out quickly and the service is very friendly. They're always trying to accommodate varying party sizes too. Lunch can get busy as I found out today, but these guys are so efficient, they get everyone fed and paid within the lunch hour. Must be practice!!  All in all, Nefelie's is the bomb and I'll be coming here as much as I can steal time away from my work day. I'm glad to have found this place, because it stands out from many of the generic restaurants on Tryon and the Epicenter.  Be back soon!  5/5"}
{"text":"Great service and a great atmosphere! Food is top notch and the London Broil is rrally well seasoned. Tie that in with drink/lunch specials and this is clearly the best lunch I've had yet!"}
{"text":"Got food to go. Their fries were average. But the reason for the 2 stars is how bad their ranch and service is. We ordered 3 orders of fries with honey mustard and ranch in each box. They combined two of the fry orders and only gave us one ranch and honey mustard to share. The food was OK but the ranch was a dumpster fire. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and it was pretty good. I would actually give it 3.5 stars. I had the salmon which was tasty and had a salsa on it that really kicked up the flavor, but the salmon was gray, so must have been a different type of salmon. I had green beans and potatoes as my sides. The green beans were ok, the potatoes were yummy. I'll go back to try another lunch special."}
{"text":"So I've come here a few times with coworkers for lunch and this is a spot I wouldn't goto on my own. The first time I came here I remember it being pretty good. The stuffed chicken was juicy and the fried okra was crispy. At that time I would've given the place 3 stars. The last few times have been subpar as I tried other items on the menu. This last time I visited I got the fried pork chops, fried okra, and roasted potatoes instead of the fries so I'd have one non fried item on my plate. The pork chops were way tough and dry likely because it is a thin cut and you can't really deep fry meat that thin without overcooking it. The fried okra was good though, a bit soggy but seasoned perfectly. Roasted potatoes were good as well but needed more seasoning."}
{"text":"Great food and fun laid back atmosphere. Stopped in for a quick lunch but ended up staying for longer as everyone was so welcoming and friendly. I just moved to the city so it was a great first impression!"}
{"text":"Imma going with four stars for now. Yes I've read ya'lls reviews while I was deciding. I was in the mood for a burger.. ok? Never been in the place - secluded upstairs like an upstairs hole in the wall. My kinda joint. I did a search on Yelp and came up with them for a burger.. Guess what folks.. Best burger going.. Why? They'll cook it medium rare!!! They're steak burgers. No pre-ground meat rules to follow on that one. And the beef, so they claim, is grass fed. It tasted fantastic.  The scene was pretty quiet. I was there well after lunch rush. It has a cozy vibe to it. What's not to love. I can tell the chef is from the heart of the culinary underbelly too. Awesome. Someone who has respect for their meat not to turn it into a hockey puck you just have to love. Granted I was here at an off hour, but the service was really quick. If you get here when it's busy and they're slow, I'm sorry I wasn't there during normal lunch hours to give a review.  Downsides. The fries were so promising. Double blanched would be my guess. I'm thinking I might have had my fries cooked in the same oil as fish from lunch earlier. At least I had the aroma of fried fish in my fries. That's not a good sign. If you're mixing oils, I'd hate to see your walk-in.  Speaking of signs, I can't provide you with a health score either. I saw the sign with the score laying on the bar. It magically grew legs before I had a chance to read it. I saw it initially and thought it said something like 94.5. That struck me as odd. I'd check that if you plan on eating here next just to make sure I saw the sign correctly before it vanished.  I'd give them a try again. Sorry ya'll had some bad luck here and a feel ya. I'll give it a couple more go's and if it changes, I'll change my review."}
{"text":"Gyro plate... ehhhhh. Not as good as metropolitan across the way but they stop serving lunch at 2pm so I had to get my rotating lamb beef fix and I gave it a try. Salty."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Lemon pepper chicken is a must and gyro plate is the bomb."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mediterranean food and it serves as an ok lunch spot uptown but there are so many better options around..."}
{"text":"You guys.  $8 ribeye special on Thursdays?!?! R U kidding me???  This place was the jam.  I headed over to the Arcade and I almost walked into Metropolitan, but the marquee for Nefelie's caught my eye.  I took a gander at the menu, and I was sucked in.  They have daily specials, which (if they're anything like the ribeye special) seem to be a great value.  Ordered a take-out meal since we were having a break room lunch, and the whole time I was wishing that I had convinced the lunch-bringers to come with me.  I had some time waiting for my food to really look around and see the room and I was really digging the ambiance.  Relaxed, and low key, with some TVs scattered around.  Cute bar area and large windows overlooking the Arcade.  When you walk in, there's just a bar downstairs, so you have to go up the stairs to the actual restaurant, which I'm finding is standard for some of the arcade places.  I will definitely be back, and paleo/primal friends will appreciate the Thursday special fo-sho."}
{"text":"Nefelie's says it's Greek.  If that's the case, then there are much better options for good Greek in Charlotte (e.g. Greek Isles).  Quite simply, the food is sub-par.  It was edible, but not even close to \"good.\"  The first thing a good Greek restaurant should be able to do well is a horiatiki salad.  We ordered this to start, and instead of nice large chunks of fresh tomato, cucumber, and red onion with fresh feta and good olive oil, you get: diced cucumber, flavorless diced tomato, diced white onion, feta chunks that were clearly not the freshest, and some kind of sickly-sweet vinaigrette. Having lived in Athens and eaten very good horiatiki (including Greek Isles), this was the worst take on this dish I've ever had.  Next I had a chicken wrap pita (their version of a chicken souvlaki pita).  This was made with the same low quality vegetables, but with the driest chicken imaginable.  The flavor wasn't terrible, but I only ate this because I was very hungry. The saving grace was the fries, which were hot and crispy and pretty good (though I think there is a good chance they started frozen because they had a similar crispy coating as the fries that Burger King came out with in the 90's when they \"upgraded\" their fry recipe).  My partner had a fried fish sandwich with slaw and hush puppies, which was ok but overly greasy).  All of these elements tasted ok, but nothing really noteworthy.  Nefelie's is a bar, not really a restaurant.  At one point a REALLY drunk guy (not sure if he is affiliated with the place, but he did seem to know the bartender/only waitress by name) stumbled through the door, and spilled whatever he had in his hand all over the floor.  He then stumbled to the bar and knocked over a glass of beer, breaking the glass in the process.  2 obnoxious spills in less than 1 minute.  Loud cursing ensued, and pleas to the bartender for a rag and mop. If he's affiliated with the place, he's a disgrace and should be kept out of sight of customers.  For food alone this was 2 stars (again, it was edible at least), but atmosphere bumped it down to a 1.  The bartender/waitress was trying her best and was friendly, but this place is kind of a mess.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with co-workers for lunch and I had the beef tips with a side of rice and onion rings.  Food was uninspiring, service was average, and the place was eclectic.  That said, the prices were pretty good considering the portion.  It definitely has that \"home\" feel, but not my home, maybe your home.  The place doesn't really stand out and I would find it hard to come back to this place because nothing is really spectacular or idiosyncratic about it.  The best part is that its like a 5 block walk from where I work so I get to get in a nice brisk walk over here because the food comes out a little on the slow side.  dmo out."}
{"text":"You get exactly what you pay for here. This is a great little spot in uptown for some inexpensive but good Greek food. Service was good too!"}
{"text":"I liked the homey, relaxed atmosphere. The weird chopped mystery meat in my gyro, not so much. The surrounding bars were bristling with business. This place was not and I understand why.My bourbon with a splash of ginger ale was watery. My gyro was not a gyro. I guess I ordered all the wrong things."}
{"text":"Great service I got calimari and a gyro and the chicken was so good, not dry at all everyone in my group is so happy we stopped to eat here. No wait and the staff even double checked our order which I love when they do. Def come and give it a try it will be a great choice. Best greek in the area. Great prices get atmosphere I feel like im in greece or another country.  Loved it."}
{"text":"My friends and I were excited to go over here for our lunch today. Upon entering upstairs, there is a sign saying to wait to be seated. After standing there for a few minutes in view of the hostess, I asked if we needed to wait to be seated or go ahead and grab a spot. She points at a line of about 10 business men and said I have to cash all of them out before I can seat you. There were open tables in plain view and nobody in front of us. We decided to wait anyway and we were finally seated. The server was SO rude from the very beginning. We were told they were out of sweet tea which is what all of us wanted. So we all ordered water. I inquired about beer selection and was told that she didn't know when she would be able to go get me a beer. Okay. Water it is. She brought the waters and set them down so hard that it splashed all over the table. Didn't apologize. Didn't bring any napkins to clean it up. We ordered when she came back over.   My friend ordered the Greek roasted potatoes but for regular French fries instead. She was hungry and decided to just eat the fries instead.   I got the falafel wrap. I've had falafel many times and while I won't say it was the worst, it wasn't great at all. I ended up picking half of it and putting on the plate. The feta spinach was amazing though.   Loved the tazitki sauce and the bite of chicken from my friends gyro.   Definitely won't be going back though or recommending others."}
{"text":"Customer service and fries were good. We were the only ones in the upper restaurant at 6:30 on a Saturday night, which is not usually a good sign. We drove 50 minutes here specifically to get saganaki. I was super excited and ordered 2 orders because I love it so much. To my disappointment, it was not the same goat cheese that is traditionally used for saganaki.   Hubby had a traditional gyro and said that it was not good. Almost like chopped hamburger meat instead of gyro meat. I had a chicken pita which I thought was delicious.   We will keep looking for a good Greek restaurant, and one with authentic saganaki preferably!!"}
{"text":"Um, I dunno. I have mixed emotions. Food is mediocre. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's eh. But It's charming. Lunch specials are always abound and affordable.   Like I said, charming. The staff is incredibly nice and this place feels very homey and eclectic. I wouldn't necessarily call it a destination, but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good Greek food, very hospitable service.  BUT,  please stop using styrofoam!!  It's bad for so many reasons.  You are a sit down, table service restaurant so use 'proper' tableware- - Please."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot uptown... though it makes for a challenging afternoon since you walk away from here so well fed, you may fall asleep in front of your computer at work.  I first came here with my late friend Paul and he totally showed me the ropes.  Yes, you do have to climb some stairs to get here, but it is well worth it.  The downstairs part is the bar, but I always like going upstairs.  Almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter novel when ascending the stairs since Nefelie's is located in one of the really charming spots in Brevard Court.  In a city where a lot of things are \"new\" the court really shines as a gem and I hope they keep it that way (there's crazy development in the city right now since they finished Romeare Bearden park right across the street.  Anyways...the servers are nice and efficient and you get your food right away here.  The menu is a smattering of sandwiches and plates.  There's sometimes a special.  Paul's favorite here were the fries... they have a top secret way of making them crisp- not soggy and light.  I'm partial to their onion rings.  Usually I just go with the gyro sandwich, but occasionally I get the lamb platter that comes with two sides... EVERYTHING is pretty darn awesome and I haven't had a bad thing on the menu yet.  It's pretty tight upstairs, but it adds to the character of the experience.  I love how you can peer across the court into the businesses across the way.  The great thing about the location is that you can go eat... and the service is usually so fast you can still settle the check and go out for a stroll in the park (all within your lunch hour)."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers invited a group of us out and we were all blown away.  Dont' even read the menu, just get whatever special the server suggests.  I'm a believer of the stuffed chicken with rice and two sides...freaking outstanding.  I hope they survive, uptown restaurants are difficult in charlotte"}
