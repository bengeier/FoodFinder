{"text":"Not your typical Resturant. From the outside it doesn't look like a Resturant, walk in and it looks like a bakery but keep going and there's a small eating area. Unique and tasty food. Very pleasant staff. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Awesome pastries and cookies.  Just like grandma used to make.  Haven't tried restaurant yet, but I will soon."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE with nice ambience, delicious food, accommodating staff, reasonable prices, fast service, clean restrooms, available parking, approachable owner and a simple menu (everything their neighbor The Blue Door isn't). Glad they moved over to this side of town!!!"}
{"text":"Food is quite nice and fills a unique pocket of world cuisine for the area. Breakfast has a nice blend of eastern european and american choices. Great little bakery and store with more things unique to the area, and a really friendly staff. Oh, and the music was actually fantastic as well. Special little place with good prices, will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"At first,  I thought the menu looked like it was trying to be a little too hipster and pretentious.. .  After trying it? I can't give less than a 5. The chocolate chip pancakes were fluffy and amazing,  the hash Browns were good,  the eggs were cooked to perfection and went really well with the ciabatta bread.  The bacon was perfect, The veggies and grapes on the side were a nice touch.  The espresso drinks.. Perfect amount of sweetness. Not too much,  not too bitter. Perfect.   The only thing that I didn't like,  I got some apple streudel to go,  and it was pretty soggy. But since everything else was so good,  I'm still giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Tried the Monte Cristo because of the other review an here and it was amazing. It was $10 and came with a side of strawberry preserves and half a banana. $10 seems fair to me. I also tried some of the fruit filled cookies. They were also good but slitghly pricey for me."}
{"text":"Restaurant and store operated by a Serbian family, serving great Serbian and American food for breakfast and lunch and Serbian and ither European style pastries. Try the Cevapi (Serbian style sausage served with onion and sour cream and good bread.) Very friendly people. The small grocery store side has a nice variety of East European foods including great coffee and a nice selection of mineral waters. Choice of booth or table seating, clean brightly lit environment."}
{"text":"Great place, the burek and strudel of all types are must tries.  Everything else from the omelettes to Monte cristo are great as well. Eat in or take out.  Also have a small European groceries with an awesome selection of specialty sparkling water not found elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place with real food! Stop in, it's right beside the Blue Door.. Which is also great, however people are lining up outside that restaurant for breakfast.... Come next door... Come inside Kiflis it's worth it!! Try the Monte Crisco."}
{"text":"This breakfast/brunch restaurant and bakery is one of the best kept secrets in Cuyahoga Falls. They never seem busy, so I wasn't expecting much. But I was impressed. I got the scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, and homemade ciabatta bread. The eggs were perfect...best I've ever had in a restaurant. The bacon was also cooked perfectly. Everything was really good and they even give you a few chunks of celery, slice of tomato and some grapes. The price is a little high, but you get what you pay for. I think it came to around $11 with the coffee and before the tip. The place is actually pretty big too. The booth was comfortable. The service was excellent. They could've used some pictures or decor on the walls, but I was there for the food, not the decor. I'd like to see this place get more business. It's worth it and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great bakery with ample parking and seating. When you enter, you'll see their grocery area off to the left and the bakery area to the right. Wait in the bakery area to be seated if eating in the dining area. The menu is small with a variety of ethnic items. My friend and I shared the Monte Cristo and it was ok. Other places I've had it served them with grilled bread, which I thought was the case here but it wasn't. The bread was delicious though without being grilled, don't get me wrong! My preference is for a stronger mustard. The restaurant is clean thorough out with a quiet atmosphere. Pick up some bakery items on the way out and be sure to check out the grocery area and pick up something new! Keep this place in mind if taking sweets to a party!"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Kiflis bakery for breakfast.  If you have not been here you are missing out on a gem!  I had an Ethnic Serbian dish with homemade sausages and a lovely handmade fresh bread with toppings and it was probably one of the best breakfast items I have ever consumed!  I dislike eggs so this is perfect for a wonderful breakfast item.  Last time I had the oatmeal!  It was amazing as well.  And the coffee drinks are very very good too ! Vanilla cafe mocha was superb.  Great atmosphere and service. People say it is a bit pricey but today was a  free meal for mom.  Either way I still would have paid full price for such a great culinary experience!  And I will return and let people know about your establishment!"}
{"text":"Food is good but we were the only customers and ordered an egg white omelette w cheese- blt- omelette was wrong- came out regular omelette- sent it back - came back white omelette no cheese??  1 order wrong twice- should have been taken off bill in my opinion"}
{"text":"Cute little bakery. Fantastic service. The food is super yummy too. Highly recommend. Blue door cafe is right next door and always crazy crowded. It's nice to have another fantastic place to go that isn't so crowded."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend there Wednesday~ loved it! I like supporting locally owned restaurants and businesses.  I give it 5 stars! They are only open for breakfast and lunch at this time. They also sell their own baked goods and have a grocery section with a variety of food products from Greece. The cafe is very nice! Clean, tables and booths, hardwood floors and walls are painted in earth tones which gives it a lot of warmth.  Oh, by the way we both had the Monte Cristo... delish!  Plenty of parking and easily accessible. Oh by the way, the coffee is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast, as my nail technician (who is from Bulgaria) told me about this place. The food was fresh, authentic, and delicious. We had coffee, split a strudel, I had a spinach and cheese burek, and my fianc√© had the sausage sandwich- all for $20. We left full and satisfied! Plus the owner gave us coupons for next time. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Good service, Great food and a quiet relaxing atmosphere.  Baked goods are fabulous. Their homemade Greek Salad Dressing is excellent. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing baked goods!!!    I live within walking distance & I'm sad to say that I only recently stopped in. This is an Old World bakery-real butter, sugar.  This isn't a fancy schmancy bakery, these are the type of cookies and pastries that my German family has enjoyed for years.  What I loved about the cookies I just ordered for Christmas is that they look like they were baked with love by somebody's grandma. They're not perfectly iced and decorated--and they taste amazing. Too many times I've found that pastries that look absolutely perfect taste like cardboard.  I also ordered a poppyseed roll and an apple strudel. These are two staples that of been in my family's holiday menu.  The only other item that I have purchased is been a cheese burek-delicious!!  I know that the Blue Fooris right across the street from this establishment, and everybody raves over that. Personally I prefer good-quality food that isn't artisan.  Stop by Kifli's and try it out. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Went to Kiflis actually to get some \"pita\" or \"burek\" they have some fresh or frozen. This is a restaurant and sells a few european groceries and candies. The owners are from the former yugoslavia. My husband and I only got the Cheese pita and the Sour cherry strudel. Both were very good! The food that others had ordered looked really good! The menu is limited but it all seems fresh prepared. It is served by very nice young people that present themselves very well. We enjoyed ourselves. Why not go try it! This place cannot (and will not) be all things to all people. I am going to give it 5 stars on what they do sell, and not fault them on not selling every food item known to man. So check out the limited menu and see if it is your cup of tea. They also sold like 30 pieces of ?evapi for like $10 or something very cheap - check the freezer."}
