{"text":"Located in the East Beaver Creep plaza with all the other Resto-Bars (Jack Astors, Boston Pizza, Keg, etc.)  Atmosphere: Average. Interior wasn't too impressing. Patio was a bit better.  The crowd was horrible. Crowd ranged from under-age girls to late 30s men. I definitely spotted many guys who were under dressed.    Service: The bouncers were rude and careless. Bartenders were slow with the drinks.   Go to Nava only if you are with a group of friends and want to have a drink on a big patio."}
{"text":"Nava is alright.   This review is when it turns into a club at night.  The music was good on Thursday night with Flow 93.5 live to air. The crowd picks up at about 11:30pm.  With only 2 bar tenders working  takes forever to get served. The patio is large, but it's only beneficial if you're a smoker.   Young crowd, average age about 26."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a 50% off Deal Find certificate. The salmon was delicious, we were quite surprised since we've been here before 2 years ago and found the food is secondary to the drinking/late-night dancing.   The restaurant was completely empty at 7:30 pm so obviously they make their money on alcohol at night, it's too weird to be alone in such a giant restaurant so I wouldn't recommend going here for dinner.   The bad rating is for the horrible waitress that kept bringing us diet pepsi and didn't bother to tell us that it was NOT free refills. $20 worth of pop showing up on our bill was absolutely disgusting and when we confronted her she advised we requested the pop's, they were not brought out involuntarily.   As a result I never intend on going back. Thank goodness we only had to pay 50% for our food."}
