{"text":"Food is fantastic and very reasonably priced. So glad they opened one up in Tempe, much closer to where we live. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"If your looking for a guilt free lunch that's also delicious give this place a try...don't let the words vegan/vegetarian warn you off the food is actually great with the added benefit that it won't make your pants tighter"}
{"text":"My sister and I finally decided to try Loving Hut after wondering about it for a long time (and finally being on that side of town when they happen to be open). I ordered the Hawaiian Burger with Seasoned Fries and she ordered the Amazing Sauté and an order of Spring Rolls.  We will start with mine. The burger was far from being such. It was two bland Tofurky-like patties covered in a less than satisfying teriyaki sauce with lettuce and tomato. There was definitely no pineapple on the burger and if there were sautéed onions, I could not taste them at all. I did not notice vegenaise either. The burger was almost flavorless. The fries were good enough, but the seasoning that you pay extra for ruined them. It tasted like cheap chili powder with nothing else to bring out any flavor. Obviously, I was far from impressed with my meal, especially considering I could have made a much more flavorful vegan burger myself and it wouldn't have costed as much.  Now for my sister's \"Amazing\" Sauté. First, she was confused as to why an Asian Sauté didn't automatically come with rice. She was going to pay extra but had forgotten and decided to just try it without first. The food came out almost room temperature, which we ignored. She said that the onions and peppers were kind of good, while I found them to be flavorless (I had a couple bites of hers). I was impressed with the texture of the faux chicken, though overall, the dish was way too oily. You could see a pool of oil at the bottom of the dish. Then to add insult to injury, we found a hair in the middle of her food, long and dark. We both have light hair. For this reason, she lost her appetite and politely asked for a refund (no problem with the staff, they were very helpful). She only asked for a refund on the sauté, as she didn't mind the spring rolls, even though they were flavorless and the sauce was like sugar water.  I really do not like writing negative reviews like this, but I felt this deserved it. We were not only completely underwhelmed, but down right disappointed in almost everything about Loving Hut (including their ridiculous hours). While we do hope they improve upon the quality for the sake of the vegan movement, we will not be returning. We would rather put in the effort to cook our own food than to eat overpriced and underwhelming food."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The people here are friendly, and the food is AMAZING! I've literally had everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is good, all VEGAN, every dish I ever had was really delicious, my go to items are saigon rolls ( how in the heck did they get those things to look like shrimp, its voodoo magic I tell ya ), golden vermicelli , harmony veggie soup and golden beauty! They even infuse water with different yummy fruits !!!  Place is small, but we have always seated...just dont plan on a larger party than 4.   The vegan cakes in the fridge are sooo good too.....the staff is also super friendly! Everytime I am in the area I make it a habit to stop. Be aware though, they close from 3 to 5 I think.....its odd but they do !"}
{"text":"Very tasty Hawaiian burger. Juicy and favorable. The fries are to die for. Clean food healthy food and tasty food. What more can you ask for?   My lady got the spicy noodle soup. It's delicious!   I highly recommend it. Nice people and the little Asian lady owner is sweet and patient with us changing out orders. Give this place a try you will come back!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of stumbling on the Living Hut while on a business trip. The staff was friendly and offered great suggestions. Ate there twice in one day. For lunch I had the Saigon Roll with the Hawaiian Hibiscus juice and then came back for the Spring Rolls and the Vermicelli dish. My trip was cut short but no doubt I would have been back a third time."}
{"text":"This cute place has amazing, healthy vegan food! It's quite small, best for take out but the quality and quantity of the food for the price is unbeatable. I come from Southern California and the pricing for vegan food is usually overpriced. But this place has the same delicious taste with a reasonable price. Plus the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"My daughter and I are riding the vegan bus for her love of animals and my failing heart. She had the chow mien, which she immediately loved. I have penchant for the stronger flavors and know the medicinal values of curry. Now who can pass up a dish with save the planet for a title ? It was phenomenal with brown rice and a lemon grass tea, I went to heaven via India. Positive crew that seemed genuine in their culinary passion. Thank you for being different."}
{"text":"I have no complaints from this place. We got the pho and spicy noodle and both were super flavorful and delicious. The broth literally tastes the same as an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. I will definitely come back. This place is conveniently close by ASU main campus and yummy in my tummy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Tempe. Excellent team that is informative and helpful when both deciding on what to have or questions about the ingredients. Between the staff, clean, peaceful environment and the amazingly prepared food; it's hard to imagine a reason one wouldn't want to eat here. Whether you are Vegan or not, the food is delicious and keeps me coming back. The Golden Vermicelli and the Saigon Rolls are going to be hard to resist next time. For sure getting the Spicy Guru Rice on my next visit ."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fantastic. I just wish it didn't close in the middle of the day. I will say that it's not the best eat-in place which is completely understandable given how close it is to campus. Your best option is generally to order your food to go."}
{"text":"Saigon rolls are to die for, and the house made hoisin sauce is incredible!  I became a chef for a few reasons, but the main reason is... I love food! I have only one other time experienced a meal where I have cried, Beckett's Table and now here The loving hut. This culinarian is now hooked!  I will be back... multiple times... Wow!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get some gluten free food highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I heard Loving Hut was opening a new location just down the street from me I jumped for joy!!   This is the place to go if you are looking for a vegetarian/vegan meal without the steep cost or snooty attitude. Customer service is always top notch and the ingredients are always fresh.   I love to get an entrée and round it out with one of their handmade beverages. The golden vermicelli and Evergreen are a typical combo for me.   The only thing that keeps me from giving it a full five star rating is the cramped space and waiting time for to go orders. To avoid both inconveniences I would recommend calling in your order. Other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about Loving Hut.  Go get yourself an enlightened meal today!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this! Great variety of fresh, delicious food that satisfy every craving and are 100% approved by my omni friends. From their fried rice, chow mein and chili burger with seasoned fries, every dish hits the spot each and every time. I've been here a thousand times and I will come a thousand more! Service is great and everyone is always so nice. Definitely an all-time favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious golden rolls with sauce it's a must try. Try the Hawaiian burger if you like veggie/soy burgers and the fries are amazing. Been here a few times and am always excited to try something new."}
{"text":"We are vegans and were happy to find different options in Phoenix.  This place was just \"good\", not anything exceptional that would make us return.  I love what they're mission as a restaurant is though, that's why I only took away one star.  We probably would not return here based off of the food though."}
{"text":"First of all, I love the staff here. They are all very friendly and nice. It made our dining experience very good. I went there with my husband and father for lunch. I had curry fried rice and they really made it spicy for me so that was good. My husband got the chili burger and loved his food. My dad got the golden vermicelli dish (the one with the crispy egg rolls). They tasted soooo good. I must say these are the best egg rolls I have ever had in America!   I truly appreciated how the restaurant changed the orders according to how we would like them. They made mine spicy and made my dad's with no onions (the lady who I assume is the owner actually went there to the kitchen and talked to the cook to make sure there was no onions in his dish, that was very nice of her). They also let us use their private bathroom and brought us utensils after they served the food. Overall, they were really nice and we were impressed.   The decoration of the restaurant is really nice and cute too :) We enjoyed watching the TV on the wall in the dining area. They played videos of vegan cooking with very beautiful images.  The only downside is probably that the place doesn't have as many options in the menu as other Loving Huts. But hey! as long as you like what they have, it's not really a problem :) They do have quite a few menus and they are good ^ ^"}
{"text":"Great food! Good selection and a place for people to learn about all the benefits of veganism. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it has terrible seating options and they don't have ac on in the inside, only fans. However this works well in the winter. So it's sort of a catch 22"}
{"text":"Great vegan food and equally as great wait staff.  We loved it and will be back again next time we're in town.  :)"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu and many unexpected flavors. I love the service and how friendly they are. It may take time to get your food but it's worth the wait. Reasonable pricing, clean and friendly. The *only* complaints is the hours but I do understand people need time off and breaks!"}
{"text":"Tasty deliciousness, with dishes clearly marked as gluten free. A great addition to downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"I dream about the spring rolls! The TVP is on point!! all vegan which is super rad! My buddy and I loved this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian person at all, but I thought I'd give this place a try and I was so amazed by their familiar items on their menu.  I tried their vermicelli bowl and dang, that was really good. At times I forget that I was eating a vegan dish. I say if you're adventurous, give this place a try, it's a good alternate place to eat if you're feeling healthy-ish. Just heads up this place is really tiny probably only fits 10 people inside"}
{"text":"I'm a first time-customer, and I'm reasonably impressed by this place. I'm going to have to go back again to try more of the awesome stuff on the menu, I could hardly decide what I wanted with so many 100% vegan options.   I really appreciate so many great meal options not to mention some desserts, which vegans usually have to skip out on at many other restaurants. This seems like a place that you could bring your non-vegan friends to and they would really enjoy any animal-free meal they order here. A lot of the food here is Asian-inspired which is great since there aren't a ton of traditional vegan-friendly options at other Asian restaurants.  The interior of the restaurant is pretty small with three little tables inside and some seating outside. If I was eating my food here, I would probably take it outside. The place was full when I ordered to-go and I wasn't quite sure where to stand, but I guess it's a good sign that that were busy on a Friday night.   The kitchen is open past the ordering counter which I really appreciate seeing because it makes the place seem transparent and more welcoming. I also really liked seeing the messages posted in the restaurant about the positive impacts of making a choice to eat vegan, even just for one meal. It brings more attention to the cause in a positive way and reminds me of some of the reasons that I live vegan.  The staff was helpful and friendly to me and the other patrons. I got my food in a reasonable amount of time considering the items I ordered and the traffic of the other orders.  Since I simply could not decide what to get, I decided to go with the Blissful Fried Rice for my main entree because I figured I couldn't go wrong with that. It has a very good umami flavor and the classic peas and carrots you would expect to find in the non-vegan version. The tiny cubes vegan ham are a good protein addition. I think the flavor of them gets a little lost in the other seasonings, but that's really not a big deal. I was skeptical about the soy crisps in the rice, but they added a nice texture that kind of filled the textural void of there being no eggs. My only complaint that there was a few too many for my liking, so I'm going to ask for them to go light on them or just omit them entirely next time.  I also got plain French fries that seemed to be made fresh but were very under salted, if salted at all. This may have been because I ordered the non-seasoned fries, but this is still better and easier to fix than over-salted fries.  The Iced Mumbai Chai was so amazing, well spiced and not overly sweetened. It tasted totally homemade and balanced, unlike some other chais that taste very syrupy. I just wish you could order a bigger size! This drink was better than pretty much every non-vegan chai tea I've ordered at any coffee place. I would definitely recommend trying this with your meal.  The chocolate cake is pretty decent as well. This is one of the first non-homemade cakes I've had since going vegan and it wasn't half bad. Definitely more moist than a lot of other vegan cakes I've made or purchase. The frosting is a little flavorless, but it's a good sized slice especially if you're just craving a slice of cake.  Portions seem appropriately priced and sized, you might be able to split certain items if you didn't have my kind of appetite. I'm definitely excited to try this place again!"}
{"text":"YUM. This place is vegan heaven. Between my boyfriend and I we got two Fabulous Pho's, Saigon rolls, Golden Vermicelli, Iced Mumbai chai and two pieces of cake all for about $47.   The atmosphere is quaint and cute. There are a few tables inside so plan ahead on the weather if you're going during peak hours. However if the weather is nice, the patio has more seating and super cute white chairs.   My honey and I enjoyed all the food, one little bummer I found... the Fabulous Pho was delicious as were the substitutes but it did not come with enough substitutes for $9 a bowl. More beef, fish balls and fish sticks would make this place 5 stars!  Over all we enjoyed all the food Loving Hut had to offer."}
{"text":"Boys and girls, DO NOT PASS THIS SPOT UP. I got the Magnolian Wonder with a side of rice. There was so much flavor, I practically gobbled it all in one seating. (p.s. Quite a lot of food for the price you pay) My boyfriend got Spicy Kung Pao. The amount of spicy flavoring was just perfect. He didn't enjoy the pineapple in it (booooo, I know) but I thought it evened out to the perfect sweet and spicy taste. This spot is super small, only a couple seats inside, but a few more outside seating is available. And the service is just great. Vegan or not- YOU MUST GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY. Five stars (10 if possible) across the board!!! :)"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Let's just say this is my go to place for lunch. Everything so far has been so fresh and oh so good! I think by the time I leave Phoenix I will probably be able to tell you how the entire menu taste...lol. Small cute little gem with just enough room for a quick bite. If you're in the area definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Carefully prepared, healthy and flavorful vegan food, presenting salads, pho, burgers, fried rice and chow mein."}
{"text":"My favorite all time vegan spot. I travel 45 miles here from San Tan Valley at least once a month to eat the Mongolian dish and spicy chick less Kung pao. So good. Always taste fresh and fun to order because the girl at front is always so happy."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It's a small place and there isn't very much room to sit so not great for large groups. You order at the counter and it takes a little bit of time for them to make your food. I usually order a bahn mi. I've tried both the chicken and beef version and they are both really good. They have amazing sauces and spreads on their sandwiches. The spring rolls are also really colorful and good. I've been trying to find a good place for vegan bahn mi's so was so happy when I found this loving hut location had them. They also have pho and soups and desserts. I highly recommend this for anyone who is vegan, likes vegan meals, or wants to try vegan food. The sandwiches are super flavorful and filling. If you love bahn mi's or mock meat give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've tried their chow mein, the spicy guru fried rice and the spring rolls at loving hut and everything has been delicious full of flavor quick service and friendly staff.i am writing this review while waiting for the bbq vermicelli and i can't wait to taste this dish."}
{"text":"This was my first time having vegan food & it was mighty tasty! I've had vegan desserts before but that's a different story. One of my friends loves this place & comes often. It's very tiny, barely any seating inside, so keep that in mind if you have a group. They're located in a shopping center with other businesses so parking is not an issue. The staff were sweet & kind. I needed to pee really bad when I got there & the girl at the register walked me through the kitchen to where their restroom is. I got the Chow Mein per my friends recommendation & it was better than a lot of chow meins I've had! The \"beef\" - which was made of soy protein & nuts - looked, smelled & tasted like beef! The only difference is the texture is a little softer than real meat. I actually preferred it to be honest. The other great thing was the food was not greasy like most noodle dishes. It was flavorful & filling but not heavy. I look forward to trying more of their food!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food. I have visited 3 times now. Twice for dinner and once a call in pick up order. Every time it's hot & delicious. I've had their spicy \"beef\", spicy soup, & Hawaiian burger. You really can't go wrong. Excited to try more items! Great for everyone - loved by vegans!"}
{"text":"Every vegan in the Phoenix suburbs knows how difficult it is to find a quality vegan restaurant that isn't miles and miles away and/or outrageously expensive. This spot is right in the heart of Tempe and makes for a nice place to have lunch! The staff is super friendly, the food is delicious, and their values are awesome. I love eating here. I'd be really happy to see them expand and grow and add a few more options to their already fantastic menu."}
{"text":"This location used to be really good. Seems like the prices are higher for less food than the last time I came. Used to get fries with the sandwiches which made it worth it. All in all it's a decent place for vegan food."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets is absolutely right! I yelped this place and saw it had gotten really high scores. I'v been on the lookout for some vegetarian restaurants lately and this was one of the places that popped up. So we decided to give it a go. For starters, they are a local family owned spot it seemed like. The employees and owner were super sweet! We ordered Saigon roles for an Appetizer. They were so fat and stuffed in a rice paper with vermecelli, shrimpless protein, veggies and peanuts. The dipping sauce was tangy and sweet. When the waitress came to drop it off at out table, she said \"Enjoy I made this with my Heart\". Awwww! Such a sweetie! We enjoyed every little bite! Next we ordered the Paradise Salad, and what an appropriate name! Nice crunchy veggies - 2 kinds of cabbage, lettuce, cilantro, peanuts and an amazing sweet and tangy dressing. For the main course we order the Amazing Sautee which was a chickenless dish with red and green bell pepper and brown rice, along with the Chili Burger which just melted in your mouth. When my boyfriend went to get the food from inside, the owner said \"thank you for eating Vegetarian, you just saved a little life\". Awwww! So true! For the grand finale we got slices of the Chocolate and Pandan cakes. Just perfect, not too sweet, moist and melted in your mouth! The ASU game was on and we saw fireworks in the background. It was a perfect dinner spot! Very nice and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Got the Golden Rolls, Mangolian , and Chow Mein. All very delicious! The texture of the meat is perfect and the seasoning couldn't have been any better. The rolls are really good too. The place is really small and although it's busy the wait isn't too long."}
{"text":"I am so happy we found this place !! My daughter and I are new to eating Vegan and your food makes it easy. The Pho and curry soup are so amazing"}
{"text":"The food here is soooo good! I've tried all of the sandwiches, a few of the stir fries, and several desserts and I would get everything a second times. Haven't tried something I don't like. The best part is that they will put the food into my personal tupperware/ jar so I don't have to create any trash when I go eat there! The staff were all very friendly the only con is that there is very little seating but it's great food to grab and go."}
{"text":"First time in 6/30/17 and we will be back. Per usual I remembered that I wanted to take pics after I had devoured my food. I had the chili burger and fancy fries (seasoned) which I would recommend. I'm a meat eater, but though this was one of the better veggie burgers I've had. I do wish it came on multigrain vs. white bun. Husband had one of the noodle dishes. He really enjoyed his meal as well. We didn't try any of the deserts but they looked good. You order at the counter. There is minimal seating and the place is small and hot this time of year. I think they have AC but obviously keep it set to a higher temp. Seating is cramped and not too comfortable so I'd likely get food to go in the future. They are trying To be environmentally friendly I assume so they're are no napkins without specifically asking, which is just sort of inconvenient. I also didn't see any bathrooms anywhere (didn't ask). I do want to come back and try the pho and curry sometime. Not many vegan options and this is a good one so check it out."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for some time now, and was finally able to check it out. Boy have I been missing out! My family is newly vegan and I have to say eateries like the Loving Hut have made our transition feel like a breeze! Everything we tried was delicious. We had the golden rolls, save the planet curry, chow mein and the amazing saute. The staff was super friendly and welcoming. Yes, the seating is somewhat limited, but we were able to find an available table once we were through ordering our food. Definitely worth our drive from Gilbert, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a gem in Tempe! I had the guru fried rice. It was delicious! Plenty of portions for 2-4 servings. The restaurant space is small but very clean and polished! Will for sure go back to check out some other vegan items. I recommend calling ahead to pick up!"}
{"text":"The food seems bland here in comparison to other vegan restaurants. I will say the staff is really friendly and the service is pretty quick even when they're busy so at least that's a plus. The drinks and food are also a little over priced and I just really think that all the \"meat\" tastes exactly the same and isn't flavored for whatever dish it's going in. I almost get a frozen premade meal kind of vibe from this place."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. They have amazing gluten free options, and they are very careful if you let them know it's an allergy not a preference. The flavor is AMAZING, and they have very generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for my delivery service at door dash and it smelled amazing. Came back today for my lunch break and enjoyed their guru curry fried rice, can't wait to try more of their entrées, and I'm an omnivore !"}
{"text":"Just OK. Food was very underwhelming and tasted mass produced. I don't think this place deserves the glowing reviews it got on yelp."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.   Pro: - The people who greets and serves customer usually very friendly and pleasant (I ordered a lot from here and they are pretty consistent service wise though I have had less than stellar encounter twice) - Good food. My favorite is the Golden Beauty, Blissfull Fried Rice and the Spicy Noodle (recommended) - For drink, I recommend the the iced Mumbai Chai - Place is fairly clean  Cons: -Small spot only few tables to sit and eat (rly meant more for ordering to go) -If you do eat inside, it is hot"}
{"text":"I was really skeptical about this place until i went! I was told to never substitute meat with meatless products but this place really makes you question is this really meatless. The faux chicken I had was amazing. The chili burger... not so much! It was good but I could definitely tell it was not beef!"}
{"text":"For vegan food, it's not bad.    The clerks are really nice. But it takes forever to have you food."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Unfortunately, the Loving Hut relies rather heavily on imitation meats. Another con was the tediously slow service. Everyone was very nice but, oh boy, it took forever for someone to take our order, even though there was no one ahead of us. The waitress was chatting with some other patrons for about 15 minutes before another cashier came to help us, then it took her five minutes to enter our order into the register. By the time we had our order completed there was a line of about five groups behind us. That's not to say the staff wasn't extremely nice, just not trained well and rather clumsy.   Most of the pricing was alright, but I thought the tiny Chili side (they used a small plastic condiment container) was overpriced at $3 for about two tablespoons worth.   The food was delicious and I might be back to try to find something healthier on the menu."}
{"text":"A little too much fake meats and unclear ingredients. The area is also super dodgy. Maybe ok for take out but to eat in is not the best."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a negative review because I really do like the food. But I called to place a to order and each time was sent to voicemail. The last 7 second call I made while I was walking up to the counter. The phone rang with employees in the area of the phone and no one made an attempt to pick up the phone. When I asked what time the establishment stopped answering the phones they said \"9pm\". I hope their customer service improves."}
{"text":"Good cheap vegan food. It is very tasty and at a very reasonable price. The staff is friendly and helpful with the menu. My only complaints are that they take a while to make an order and they don't play music, but they have a tv that has a cooking show with the SAME SONG OVER AND OVER  but those are just minor things. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!! I love finding vegan restaurants. You can even customize your order to be gf or not!"}
{"text":"Food is so good. Best meatless dishes I have ever had. Give them a try you will not be unhappy."}
{"text":"I don't frequent vegan restaurants so this is truly an unbiased review, with my main comparison being \"regular\", \"meat-based\" food. That said, this place is absolutely delicious. I just recently stumbled across it on a work lunch, and considering the fact that it's just minutes from my workplace, I've already been back several times. The BBQ Vermicelli is hands-down amazing. The meatless \"beef\" has a great flavor and the vegetables are really fresh. I could eat it everyday. The service is impeccable (so friendly) and the place is really cute. There isn't a lot of indoor seating, but it's perfect for a quick, extremely reasonably priced lunch. I have told several people about how great it is and hope that many continue to try it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I do wish they would do a better job of cleaning the tables. One women ate her food with the last person's trash in a pile next to her. One girl buses the table removing the dishes never takes the trash away and doesn't wipe it down. The food is wonderful but the service ... Eh so so."}
{"text":"I make a point to regularly support the smaller VEGAN restaurants weekly, because I am of the belief that we need to sprinkle a little more love onto the world in this way. Loving Hut, albeit a smaller location in Tempe, always hits the spot with their no msg, generous servings and low prices. The women who work here are extremely nice and orders are always piping hot even if you choose pick-up, which is ready in just a short amount of time. I've tried a handful of items on the menu and I often I can't even choose what I want (thus resulting in lots of leftovers, I'm not complaining). I am fully vegan for years now but the faux meats satisfy even your most skeptical carnivore. I'm so happy this Tempe location opened up because I will keep coming back here, gladly."}
{"text":"\"So sorry I offended so many vegans. In Missouri we raise pigs and cattle and chickens to eat them.\""}
{"text":"Great Vegan food. You can eat here even if you're not a vegan it's that good. Doesn't look like much on the outside and not a lot of seating available but food is amazing and so is the service. My favorite is spicy noodle soup and the Guru Rice Bowl.  Looking forward to trying other dishes too."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, great food , I have been coming here for years , however today I didn't liked the attitude of owner or manager, she made employee getup while eating & told , \"go eat outside\" it's not that cold , are you kidding it's freezing outside! I think that's very rude , this person is sweetest employee I have seen working here so far and also working so hard . Employee should be treated nicely ! Great chef here , good people working here , but no love for employee at loving hut !"}
{"text":"We come to Loving Hut once a week, it's our go to spot for something quick and healthy especially considering the lack of vegan places in Tempe. The service is great and always accommodating. If you sit inside, they play really cute videos of baby animals and that alone gives this place an extra star. The prices are great, everything is made in house, 'nuff said."}
{"text":"The spring rolls were alright but the spicy noodle soup left little to be desired. My co-diner had the curry and he seemed to enjoy it. The perk was eating it while drinking beer just a couple buildings down. I wouldnt mind trying other items on the menu but I will probably go other places prior to returning here. Feel like I cook better at home."}
{"text":"What a cute little gem of a place. Amazing food, don't be afraid if you're not a vegan it's amazing. Great vibes, fast service and good energy  Definitely on my list to return here"}
{"text":"I am glad to finally have a loving hut in the east valley, one might say I love having that hut near by.  This is a small store front. 3.5 tables inside and 2 patio tables, so don't bring a big group, to go may be a better way to go. They also lack a true public bathroom.  The food was great. I tried the Bhan Mi which was great, fresh bread, veggies and the best seasoned fake meat in town. I also had the spicy soup which was nice but not too spicy, the faux fish balls were nice with an intresting texture."}
{"text":"Yes hands down the best bbq vermicelli I've ever had and it's what I always get. Their sweet n sour with white rice is really good, their fried rice, their Pho is also a tasty treat as well. I will say that the last couple of times I've had French fries it's not there strong suit but I'm always going to keep coming back. There staff is so sweet and they'll always take care of you. Definitely a must try.. yay"}
{"text":"This place amazing! Every time I go I leave a happy man! So many options and the people working there are always so great. I go atleast once a week and I've never been disappointed :)"}
{"text":"The food is good here, but I am confused on whether this place is better for dine in or carry out. Dine in has very limited, awkward seating and carry out is difficult. We opted for carry out last night but kept getting hung up on when we called. Their food was great, I hope they can figure the rest out too."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today and had the vegetable spring rolls with hoisin sauce that was amazing. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place so much, literally can't say enough about the food and the service. It's my gfs favorite place to eat and she's not even vegan. Thank you Loving Hut for finally giving us a place to go where she will eat with me and not complain the entire time."}
{"text":"I was there for the first time yesterday.  Pro: The foods taste great. The staffs are friendly. The place is clean. Quick service (~10 mins wait).  Con: There is not a lot of space. Take out would be best for now.  I am trying to be a bit healthier, so I will be back on a regular basis now. Definitely recommend! Note that the place is not open from 3pm to 5pm."}
{"text":"We ordered the chow mein and spicy curry rice, and both dishes were outstanding. There isn't too much seating inside, but there are several tables outside. They have a nice environment and we recommend going here and if you like vegan food. The woman who took our order was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is my to go place! The food here is delicious! I've tried many things on the menu and loved them all. The atmosphere here is chill and the customers service is another plus. I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and it was excellent. The service was friendly and the food was great. Small place but it has an outdoor patio with plenty of seating. I recommend the chili burger. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Super tiny place but it was so good! There's very limited seating inside. I was lucky to snag a table in the corner. I got the Hawaiian Burger and it was so delicious. It was kind of messy because it kept falling apart, but the taste was so pleasant. I wanted to try the carrot cake, but was way too full after my meal. Perhaps I'll come back and try it then."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little place. The vegan meat here closest in looks and taste to original meats. A little more oily for the stir frys but the taste is totally worth it. If ur a vegetarian u must try this place for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and healthy! Small area inside but you can order to go. I am not vegan nor do I plan on becoming vegan but it is nice to have some food that's made fresh and not full of \"unknown\" Ingredients. I highly recommend this place and I will be back many more times"}
{"text":"Loving the newest location! The restaurant itself has an amazing design, a very cute and intimate setting as well. The service is amazing as well. All the staff are super nice, helpful and down to earth! The food is soooo good and soooo addicting! And I also love the info on veganism, it's a great way to spread awareness and compassion!"}
{"text":"Banh mi was amazing! So much flavor and crunch from the veggies in the sandwich. The spring rolls were great also. My new favorite vegan spot!"}
{"text":"Well while it has almost been a year since I have visited this location it will always hold a very special place in my heart. This location had a soft opening back in November of 2015 and the Wife and I were the VERY FIRST CUSTOMERS to eat at this location. If you don't believe me....just check the Facebook page for this establishment.....it tells the whole story. We had a great sample plate which included a Rainbow Salad, Golden Bounty....Kung Pao.....a Golden Roll and Thai Iced Tea for only $7.95. If your Vegan this is absolutely the best place for you to visit especially in Tempe. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been excitedly waiting for the owners of the Glendale Loving Hut to open their Tempe location. 11.21.15 was the soft opening and my husband and I were their first customers. They offered a great sample plate that included Rainbow Salad, Golden Bounty, Kung Pao and Save the Planet Curry and a Golden Roll with Tea for only $7.95; everything was fresh and delicious. This location is more of a takeout one as seating is limited. Their menu has some great options for lunch and dinner and because this location is close to my office I will be a repeat customer. They will be open Monday through Saturday 11am to 9pm. Go check them out the customer service is great and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Delicious, the only hard part is deciding what to eat & finding indoor seating but it's definitely worth it !!!"}
{"text":"I've known about this place for a while but finally found an opportunity to try this place! I am so glad I did! This place is a small, casual restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. There are many 2 or 3 small tables indoor and 3-4 outdoors. I went when it was cool and we sat outside, which we wanted since it nice outside! This place serves vegan Asian food, and they serve it well! Coming from an Asian culture, it's common to not know what kind of animal products go in our food. If there is any animal products, usually it's considered a good thing!  Finding good vegan Asian is pretty rare. This is why Loving Hut works so well. They serve vegan Asian food that is tasty and tastes/feels pretty close to the real thing! Service was very good as well. The ladies were so very kind and helpful when I had a bunch of questions for their. The restaurant had maybe 75% of its tables seating, but there was no wait to order, which you do at the counter. There was, however, a wait for the food after ordering. It took a little while longer than I would have liked, maybe 15 minutes, but I didn't mind it so much since I was visiting with my friends.  My friends and I ordered a little of everything- Saigon rolls, noble noodle bowl (one with bbq beefless and the other with chickless chunks), veggie harmony, pandan cake. Usually the saigon rolls aren't vegan due to the shrimp but everything else is. The shrimpless protein was very tasty and the best thing is: it tasted like shrimp without that noxious seafood odor...if that makes any sense.   Also, they sell vegan jerky. I was first introduced to it when my mother brought it home for me. I was skeptical initially but after eating it, I was pleasantly surprised and made a mental note to pick up few bags of vegan jerky when I came here. I think it tastes pretty close to real jerk. The texture is different, and it's more chewy. I am not vegan, but I love vegan food so I am a fan."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten here well over 50 times in the past 8 months and I loveeee it! I've been vegan for nearly a year now and I've tried a lot of vegan places in Arizona and this place probably tops them all in terms of price and quality of food. Their food is not bland compared to other vegan places I've been to and it's always priced about $12 or less. I highly recommend getting the golden vermicelli bowl that stuff is the besttttt. The iced mumbai chai is good, I like the pandan cake, and their spicy noodle and pho are pretty good too. I never have a bad experience here and their service is typically very fast. Not a lot of chairs and tables though, but that's okay! Overall, best vegan place in Tempe imo."}
{"text":"Great menu selection and reasonable prices.  I especially love the pandan cake.  Yummmmmm!  I would've given them five stars except that the space is really cramped.  There is limited seating inside with more seating outdoors.  That is fine for the winter months but if I were there during the summer, I'd be ordering to go."}
{"text":"I feel like home here! I am the only one that is vegan, my husband and kids are not and we all love coming here to eat! I love getting the noble bowl with the bbq beefless and the mongolian beefless is the favorite for the meat eaters. We have also tried the pandan cake and we love it better than any non vegan cakes, even better than tres leche cake which my husband grew up devouring his whole life! Service is so friendly and fun and we have even bought a bag of the soy protein meat so I can make plenty of vegan meals at home since living in San Tan Valley we can't eat here in person every day even though we want to! We are a family of 5 and I have made at least 4 meals so far and the bag is only half way done, not bad considering the bag is only 10$, much more affordable than real beef and no animals are being harmed, woohoo! The location is near Mill Ave so evenings can be a little busy for traffic but its a fine area and everyone understands that its mostly a spot for pick up and not dine in so everything runs smoothly even when busy."}
{"text":"Shared the Golden Vermicelli with my daughter and it was plenty! It was very filling but not heavy. The sauce was delicious. We asked for spicy and they came through.Definitely coming back to try different entrees. It's small inside so it's not really for a group. Three tables inside that are small..reminded me of elementary school tables. Four small two-person tables on the patio. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that it comes with a side of religion. I guess the founder is some kind of cult leader. Whatevs - judgment free zone. But the place is TINY. There are maybe 3 seats and they're small. Small like Ikea children's dining set small. And while they explained the long wait was because they were training a new cook, the only thing we could do was watch the TV that plays supreme leader's propaganda on loop.   Other than that the food was pretty bland. A lot of rice noodles. Not a lot of vegetables. IMHO, to be a good veg restaurant you have to be good with vegetables and not simply remove meat from dishes."}
{"text":"Fast delicious and clean dining.  I've now been to and eaten at multiple Loving Huts in different states."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing, one of the best vegan places I've tried. Even my boyfriend who is super picky and isn't vegan/vegetarian loved it. We got their spring rolls, golden rolls, and the spicy chicken-less Kung Pao and was all amazing. Also has amazing prices for what you get, would highly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"I'm new to the veganism and this place has been a huge help for me to stick to the vegan diet. I usually place a to go order by phone, as this place is tiny with limited seating. The staff are all helpful and friendly, and everything I tried is wonderful.  Easy parking, pretty big portion size (but then again, it's all plant based!) and reasonable prices..."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this cute spot. I recently became dairy-free for weight loss and vegan seemed liked the easiest route to go. I've been to other vegan places closer to my house before, but I wanted something different.   This is an Asian Fusion Vegan Restaurant! Who knew a place like this existed?! The design of the place is original, aesthetically pleasing, and super cute!  The staff is incredibly friendly and more than willing to help you navigate your way through their awesome menu!   THE FOOD! I got the Spicy Noodle Soup! Holy cow!!! So freaking good! You wouldn't even think it was vegan! So delicious!  Definitely check this place out! If you're Vegan or NOT!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! I've had the chow mein, amazing chickless saute, and fried rice. The establishment is so cute and small and I love the message that they have on the wall, just goes to show how loving and compassionate vegans are!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of Asian foods can be inherently vegan but this place is just so darn tasty!! The staff are all so sweet.  The save the earth curry and the golden vermicelli are my two go-to choices."}
{"text":"I just came here today for the first time ever. Come here for the food, not the atmosphere. It's a tiny little place that sits hardly more than a party of 4-5. Luckily, we ordered take out. Vegetarian or not, this place is tasty! As a vegetarian myself, I almost never like \"meatless meats.\" Just not my thing. But I had the Hawaiian burger from here, and holy crap, it was so delicious! Will definitely be coming back here. Yay!"}
{"text":"Have always loved the food, but the customer service is why I felt the need to leave this poor review. I came in this evening to place a to-go order. I added on two packages of their individual slices of cake to my cake. I went to grab these containers off the counter so I could step aside and wait for my order and one of the containers slipped and fell to ground. I apologized profusely, grabbed napkins to clean the bit of whip cream off the floor, and asked if I could please get a replacement. I was told I would need to purchase one if I wanted a replacement. Whereas the accident was obviously mine, I'd never heard of such a strict policy. It was obviously an accident and I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on them or something...  UPDATE WHILE I'M WAITING FOR MY ORDER: This review was going to be a two, but I bumped it up to three, because after 5 minutes of waiting for my order management approached me to say (emphasis management's), \"We don't normally replace items when it's the CUSTOMER'S FAULT , but since our cake is so good I want you to try it. So I PURCHASED this slice for you. *Reviewers note: But you're the owner?* Here's a bag... Since you can't carry a lot of things at once.\"  ...  Trying really hard to see this as a kind gesture, and not as the veiled insults it obviously is.   BOTTOM LINE: I will not deny the food is great, but the customer service is suspect. A vegan restaurant caters to a super loyal, regular customer base. My boyfriend and I have been coming to the Tempe and Phoenix locations for years, spending $40 a pop per meal generally... My theory is, why not be slightly forgiving with us instead of making us feel bad? It's standard business practice."}
{"text":"Great place! Friendly staff,  clean, excellent and very knowledgeable. I ordered the spicy noodles and they were amazing. I can't wait till my next visit so that I can try something new. What a great find in Tempe. This place is a true gem!"}
{"text":"Best vegan food! Services is fast and friendly! Really clean! Very large manu, bring my family non vegan and they love it. Their deserts cakes are aaaamazing!"}
{"text":"Great vegan food. Very excellent customer service. Yummy desserts."}
{"text":"Our office ordered our Friday team lunch from here. While it did take them longer than expected to put the order together, all the dishes were made accurately and the team loved the food! The cashier was very grateful for our large order and thanked me repeatedly for supporting a small business. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Just had the Hawaiian burger: better than any other vegan burger I've ever had (they make theirs with Shiitake mushrooms and TVP; this version had pineapple and homemade Teriyaki sauce).  Wow; can I ever go back to Gardenburger again?  The Lemongrass tea was excellent.  This will be a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"What a great place for vegan food near ASU! This Loving Hut location is much more limited in size and menu than the other ones in town, but it's great for a quick bite or to-go items. I love the guru fried rice, and the chow mein is good too. I didn't care for the golden rolls here. The ones at the Indian School location are much better. I know there are different owners for each location, but they should switch to the other type! The service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing vegan restaurant with a highly diverse menu. If you're in town, hit this place up for some of the best vegan faire the state has to offer."}
{"text":"Excellent, wide selection of vegan food with some nice healthy options. Siper friendly staff. Glad to see this place in tempe!"}
{"text":"Bomb. I've had a large portion of the menu with big highlights being the Amazing Sautee, Bahn Mi, Kung Pao, and the Golden Rolls. Staff is friendly and helpful, plus they sell jerky and textured vegetable protein right at the register. Fast, delicious, reliable."}
{"text":"I had the Bánh mì (beefless) and it was DELICIOUS! I ordered ahead, and ended up kind of getting there a little later than I had expected but the lady at the front desk was nice and my food was waiting patiently for me to arrive.  I got the seasoned fries too and they were good, even though they were cold (my fault for taking too long to get them) but I'm sure they would be even better fresh and hot!  I will be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite vegan spots in town! I usually get the lemongrass chickless chicken, blissful fried rice, and a side of the rainbow salad. All perfect together :) The chai is good and I always top Dinner off with pandan cake. So yummy. Service is good, although there's not much seating at the actually restaurant. We usually just get take out. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have loved each dish I've tried here. Friendly staff and a healthy, diverse menu that doesn't sacrifice any flavor in it's efforts to be vegan. Just wish they had a bigger space."}
{"text":"A new location for this great vegan restaurant! I was in the neighborhood and checked Yelp for someplace new to try. Well, this place has only been open a week, and I enjoy Asian food so I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  Note: each location has a different menu, and Yelp links to the menu at a different location! Use this link for the Tempe location: http://www.lovinghut.us/tempe_01/menu.html  Food: They have a very interesting menu. I rarely go to vegan places, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered the Amazing Chickless Sauté (to go), and was very happy with my choice! It was savory, and very flavorful. I added a. Bit of Siracha to kick it up a notch, but it was plenty flavorful without. I see quite a few items on the menu that look good, so I'm eager to try more.   Cost: Good: my entree was only $5.95.  Service:  They are still in their \"soft opening\", which means still training. That said, they were friendly and happy to explain the menu choices.  Atmosphere: Nice and quaint! Clean, fresh, but beware, the place is very small, with limited seating.  Overall: Very good! I'll be back to try other interesting menu items.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"If you are Vegan and live in Tempe/Mesa and haven't been to Loving Hut, where have you been?? This is our go to place when we're looking to eat out or have a meal with Vegan and none Vegan friends. Everything is delicious and gives me life."}
{"text":"Loving Hut appears as a take out style place with minimal seating and delicious food. I really enjoy their menu of various types of cuisine since they have something for both the eastern and western pallete. The service consists of a cashier that takes your order and brings the food to you. Otherwise the water and napkins are self serve. Usually I come here when I crave the golden beauty which is their fried mock chicken with a spicy sauce that I can literally drink. The beefless beef is ok but not the best. Veg-burgers and sandwiches are also offered but my tastes prefer the curry, vermicelli noodles and pho. Everything is flavorful but sometimes it tastes too sweet for a savory meal. I would like to see more vegetables at a vegan restaurant but I understand their cause and why they would pick the dishes that they have. I try to take big meat eaters here so that their meal can help save the planet. I highly recommend the food and the lifestyle. If only they could find a way to make imitation fish for vegan sushi."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  Everything I've tried is great. From the spicy soup to the bahn mi to the saigon roll, I haven't really had any items on the menu that are bad.  The fake meat, while not likely to fool meat eaters, tastes very good in its own right.  The chicken is especially tasty.  I can't wait to try all the rest of the offerings.  All vegan restaurants should be this high quality!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but wanted some vietnamese food. So I gave this place a chance. It was surprisingly good! I didn't mind the beef - like tofu for my noodle.  The service was alright. Will I go back? Likely yes."}
{"text":"One of the best vegan Asian cuisines I've found. Highly recommend the spicey fried rice and the kung pao. Also the Pandam cake."}
{"text":"I had been contemplating going here for weeks & finally took the plunge today. & i must say, I am completely amazing that all their food is vegan. I got the Saigon rolls & golden vermicelli bowl & they were amazing. Before being vegan I regularly eaten the omni version of this & would categorize myself as someone who liked authentic again food & loving hut is spot on. When eating the Saigon roll I almost questioned as to whether it was vegan or not. Def will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I'm lovin' this hut. This lilliputian vegan restaurant packs a big punch with beautifully crafted, delicious dishes that won't make you miss meat at all. We came here around noon on Saturday and there was only one other patron eating. As we left it got a lot busier and tables (4 inside and a few more outside) started filling up.  The menu consists of noodle soup, burgers, sandwiches, salads, rice noodles, and faux meat Chinese style dishes. After browsing through the menu I decided on the golden vermicelli ($8.50) and tried some chickless banh mi. I also had an iced chai to drink and spicy fries to share.  The iced chai was absolutely delicious, one of the best iced chai drinks I've had. It was beautifully presented, with a rich, velvety foam on top, a dusting of cinnamon, and a lovely chai flavor that reminded me of the great chai tea they serve at Indian restaurants. The vermicelli was equally as beautiful to behold, and had a wonderful combination of textures, temperatures, and flavors, from the grilled faux beef, the soft rice noodles, lettuce, spring rolls, shredded carrots, radish cucumber, and sauce. It was a hearty meal that I could have easily shared with another person. The banh mi was also quite delectable, with a light, airy bread with crispy outer crunch, the tender faux chicken, and crunchy pickled vegetables.  The fries were a sizable amount, with a flavorful slightly spicy tomato sauce with beans and some faux meat.   Service was friendly and cheerful and our meals took only a short time to be made.   Although the space is very small, they manage to make it a serene, peaceful environment, and I love the plant wall decorations. There is a TV on one of the walls too that plays various vegan cooking demonstrations, showing off spectacular looking dishes.  Definitely a healthier option for eating out. I'll be back for more delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"this place was so good I had it a month ago and still keep thinking about the chow mein and chicken-less saute"}
{"text":"Disappointing, I do not eat meat so I was happy to see an alternative to the usual. The prices are ok, I had one of the meatless burgers but the patty is not good. Pretty flavorless and cardboard-ish. The service was . . . Ok? But I wouldn't recommend them."}
{"text":"Loved having a vegan option! And a vegan dessert was great too! Flavors were fresh, it was made in a reasonable amount of time, it was a good amount of food, and the cashier was friendly. My table was clean too. I would come back here next time I'm in tempe!"}
{"text":"Loving Hut, more like yum give me more Hut! Loving Hut Tempe is a wonderful gourmet restaurant, made with wholesome vegan ingredients based on a plant-based diet! Awesome for you vegans and vegetarians or people who love eating meat but also an awesome taste for people who love to try new things. Located in the plaza of tips liquor and Thai basil, on university. It's a small place, but full of color, friendly and outgoing customer service the workers there are always so kind. It's truly all love, at the hut. Supposedly each location has a completely different menu but all Asian inspired dishes, I'm excited to possibly check out the Phoenix one! Tempe one is really awesome too as well, just a tad bit closer to me. Seating arrangements is more based on a order and to go type feel. You do have seating options, 3 to 5 tables inside and then about the same outside, I'd come by myself or just a friend no more than 3 people in a group but i mean you can bring more if you want, space there is just petite! So for starters I ordered the golden rolls 3.50, which you get two homage crispy rolls, veggie style with the delicious homemade sauce. To complete my meal I also ordered the Báng mì Baguette, with that you get to choose your style of protein the needless sauté which is pictured or the chickless sauté (fake chicken) . Got my order and everything was ready to eat, hot and fresh loved it, very tasty and definitely didn't 2nd guess about the beefless protein! Tastes like the real beef, asking yourself well where's the beef? So therefore Phoenix you have it, I would definitely come again, and you should too, enlighten yourself and stay hungry Phoenix !"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm not a vegan, i was a bit skeptical but decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised with my rice dish with \"chickless\" chicken? What a great clean taste the \"chickless\" protein had a meaty flavor and their house sauce is light and sweet with a very small spice to it. I also ordered a chai tea and it was probably one of the better ones I've had.  Service was excellent i was in a hurry to get back to work. I heard the girl taking orders tell they guy in front of me 15-20 minutes. I didn't have that kind of time to wait so i verified before i ordered. It was true but they were kind enough to make my order quick so i could get back to work which was greatly appreciated!  Great service, great food and drinks. I don't think ill ever become a vegan but I'll definitely come here again"}
{"text":"This lovely little gem is rite now the street from my shop and I tried it for the first time a few months back. I got the chick less fried rice and it was pretty good. The next time I tried their Pho and it was better than the chickless fried rice. The last time I went I tried the yellow curry and WOW! THIS IS THE DISH TO ORDER! They put cilantro on the top and serve it with seracha sauce and I seriously cant get enough of it. I get cravings for it and have tried making it at home and nothing comes close to the flavor this dish has. I love that all the veggies aren't overcooked and mushy. They also serve healthy beverages like their hibiscus ice tea which I very good and sparkling grapefruit juice which is refreshing as well."}
{"text":"Pinch me!! I am so happy this place is here! Rachelle who took my order is such a very sweet and helpful person! The food was amazing! I ate my Thai cake first, recommended by Rachelle, and it was ON POINT! Probably, the best cake I have ever eaten. And that is saying something! I do admit that I ate my cake first! Next, the spring rolls were amazing. There was a bit of pickle inside which made for a nice flavor profile. Finally, the fragrant Pho soup. Beyond!!! This restaurant made me happy to live here and just happy full stop. Loving Hut please never leave!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Tried it for the first time after wanting to forever! I had their chili burger with seasoned fries. It was really good & filling! I didn't even finish half of my fries.   This place was pretty busy around lunch time and  has a fixed menu offering a number of different Asian dishes. Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Non vegan here, great food. Had the golden vermecelli bowl and loved it. Girlfriend got the curry which was great as well. Will certainly be back"}
{"text":"I didn't know Loving Hut existed outside the Bay Area, so I was pretty excited to hear that there were a few in AZ! Girlfriend and I visited this location a few weeks ago. I got the spicy noodle soup, which to me is just a slice of home. She had the yellow curry soup with rice. We both enjoyed our meal thoroughly, and will definitely be visiting again! The space is tight, but the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"I tried them for lunch today. They had a great menu with many different dishes from eastern to western cuisine and all vegan. It was clean, cozy, and small but in an intimate way. I ordered the pho and the golden rolls. They were both good the only thing is they use meatless \"meat\". I personally find dishes without these meats to be better, I  do not like the flavor imitation meat has. The pho broth was very nicely flavored and they give you all the usually fixings and a large size. The golden rolls were crisp and had veggies inside with a sauce on the side.   The service was good everyone was friendly and overall I would come back to try many of the other dishes I would just opt out of the meat substitute!"}
{"text":"Very good vegan food. I have tried several items and enjoyed them all. Some people I know do not like the imitation beef but I enjoy it. Super small dinning area. I prefer to order take out."}
{"text":"This is such a little gem by ASU! I'm not vegan and typically don't go to vegan places but really wanted to give Loving Hut a try. I tried the \"Amazing Sauteé\" and just like its name, it was AMAZING! I had no idea vegan food could taste this great. The fake meat not only had the same taste as real meat but also the same texture! I'll definitely return to try the other dishes. It's a small place so try to avoid lunch time or just get it to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to vegan joints. I usually get the BBQ vermicelli bowl. It's my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy vegan food and great loving environment! Wonderful staff and great inspiration. Enjoyed 'Save the world Curry' which was hot and tasty and full of veggies! Yum! Try the iced Mumbai chai. We need more love in this world! Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been to the Loving Huts in Phoenix and Glendale and this one is by far the best! They have excellent customer service and AMAZING vegan food! My husband and I tried the kung pao, spicy fried rice, chow mein and the Mumbai chai. Everything was so flavorful and just the right amount of spiciness. We just moved walking distance from this location so we will definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"This particular location has no customer loyalty. Have never dined at a restaurant that can't make brief changes to an order. I'd never refer another customer to this location. The place is almost ran like a Cult."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and was on the hunt to find a good vegan restaurant, which can be challenging.  The hotel recommended and of course the great reviews on yelp made we want to give Loving Hut a try.  It exceeded my expectations.   Staff was super friendly and very passionate about vegan lifestyle, which was refreshing, since I have to tone it down around my meat eating friends.  I had the Saigon roll and the Pho, YUM.  The Saigon rolls were to die for and my meat eating friends agreed.  They raved about their meals and were happy with our decision to eat at Loving Hut."}
{"text":"The iced Mombai chai is AMAZING! Real spices, not at all like the Starbucks artificial flavoring. You can taste the cinnamon and star anise, it's incredible and a well prepared iced treat on a hot summer's day, well worth the reasonable price. The atmosphere is lively and the staff are very friendly and knowledgable. I have been a vegetarian for over ten years, and I was so glad that this was my first stop on the ASU campus. A must-stop for members of the veggie community and meat lovers alike!"}
{"text":"Literally. Oh. Em. Gee. This place is delicious. After years of wanting to try this place, I was finally able to! I was not disappointed whatsoever. The flavors were all so wonderful. Nothing was bland. I had the beef banh mi, the chai tea, and the spring rolls. Seriously I could eat here everyday. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu.  The portion sizes were large and the all the food was very filling. The staff is super friendly and the food is fresh and healthy. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Yes it's true this location is very small. Probably better for takeout. I came on the Martin Luther King holiday early afternoon, and I was able to get a seat.   The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very clean. I had the beefless bahn mi. It was just like I remembered it from the other location I've been to. Large bun that was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Nicely seasoned fake meat. Pickled carrots that are excellent. I love it and the portion size was good.   I like the decor cute little tables!  Their menu seemed smaller than the one in Glendale, but as long as I can get those vegetarian bánh mì sandwiches I'm happy!"}
{"text":"The newest Loving Hut has opened in Tempe, AZ, and the world is smiling. If you're not familiar with Loving Hut, they are the largest vegan restaurant chain in the world. This location is brought to you by the owners of the Glendale LH location.   I went for their grand opening party on Saturday, 21Nov15, which they sweetly dubbed a \"Welcoming & Appreciation\" Party. From 11am-9pm, they served only a special menu, which consisted of Golden Rolls, Rainbow Salad, Golden Beauty, Kung Pao, Save the Planet Curry, and your choice of Lemongrass, Jasmine, or Hibuscus tea all for only $7.95! This idea is ingenious. Kudos to whomever came up with this. It allowed newbies to try several different dishes, and gave me a chance to go outside of my normal go-to dishes. It was a LOT of food and it came out fast and delicious. 'Twas a very successful and well-organized soft opening.   The employees were all extremely nice. I felt like family; it made my soul smile.   How can you not love Loving Hut? Not only are they 100% vegan, but they are passionately committed to saving the planet (Eco-friendly containers) as well as animals, and they are always sweet and kind. It truly is a Loving Hut. Peace and love, y'all!"}
{"text":"Great food , will be back !!!!!!! General Chicken is To dye For!!! Yum !!  Place was clean and up to my standers !!"}
{"text":"I AM A CARNIVORE WHO LOVES LOVING HUT!!! Sorry for yelling but I needed to clear that up. I was introduced by a vegan buddy who was super excited that the restaurant followed her from California. Food was great. I have tried the soups, noodles, and sandwiches and have not had a bad experience yet. This is helping me move closer to my vegetarian serious less meat eating diet and I am super glad that this type of food is available. Ohhhhhh. Don't forget to try the deserts... Just saying."}
{"text":"Awww the girl working was so sweet and quirky. *Soul Sister*   It was a couple weeks ago when I went, but yummmmm!!!! The little crispy roll things I got were delish and the curry soup with naan...I ate it so fast haha, it was so good. Love it here, see you next time I'm down there! xx"}
{"text":"What a great vegan spot in Tempe! I have been here twice so far and am happy to report that I will be going back as their menu is chock full of vegan goodies!   The first time I went here I tried the fried rice which was really good and flavorful...and the portion was a good size.   The second time I ordered the Hawaiian burger as the lady taking my order suggested it. What a great suggestion! Whatever sauce they put on that thing is fabulous! The burger also has tons of delicious ingredients such as pineapple, fresh crisp lettuce, and mushrooms. I am not a fan of mushrooms but these were fantastic.   Can't wait to go back and try the pho and some of their delicious salads."}
{"text":"Vegans/vegetarians rejoice!  Loving Hut is here in Tempe.  The restaurant itself is super small, seats maybe 9 people inside?  I would only order to-go from here.  I tried the Saigon Rolls appetizer.  The rolls were bigger and fatter than the typical non-vegan Spring rolls you get from Vietnamese restaurants.  The \"shrimp\" was made from sea-plants and tasted pretty much just like shrimp to me!  I liked their peanut dipping sauce a lot. The only thing is that I would def share that appetizer, because eating 2 of those big rolls on your own is too much and at the end the shrimp started tasting weird to me.  Also I didn't care too much for the pickled carrots inside, I think I would have preferred just regular carrots!  For my meal I got the Spicy Noodle Soup that came with tofu, fake \"beef\", potatoes, bean sprouts, and noodles.  I loved the flavor of this soup, very spicy and warming on a cold day!  I didn't much care for the tofu, but the fake beef was really yummy!  The potatoes seemed a bit undercooked to me.  It was a lot of food though, that one order turned into 2 meals for me!  For dessert I tried the chocolate cake.  I really wanted to try pandan cake, but they were all sold out!  The chocolate cake I would pass on next time.  It was pretty dry and not quite as fudgy or rich as I would have liked.  The nice thing was it wasn't \"too sweet\" so if you have less of a sweet tooth, you might enjoy it more."}
{"text":"I rarely write negative reviews but I was shocked when I saw such a high rating. From the service to everyone's meals... It was all bad. If you're looking for vegan/vegetarian options this place will let you down. Giving them 2 stars because the place was clean and fair-priced.   The specifics: One thick beard hair in my sandwich, employees who really didn't understand the menu and slow service.   They also fully refunded our meal after reaching out directly to the owners which was appreciated."}
{"text":"I wish there were more than 5 stars to give. I've been craving their food everyday. Every single option on the menu is amazing! Do NOT forget to try one of their cakes located in the refrigerator case."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of their fake meats that they want to put on every dish and wish they would focus more on plants - both in variety and flavor/methods (like 24carrots for example). That said, I love their paradise salad, it's massive and cheap."}
