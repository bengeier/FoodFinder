{"text":"Not that great. I had the chicken parm and there was hardly any meat to it. Also the theme is peculiar: is this an Irish Pub or a pub with rock idols everywhere? It's a little bit of both and I don't get it."}
{"text":"I ended up here for lunch today. I ordered the wings and fries and couldn't finish the plate.  The wings were large and crispy as we're the fries. The beer was reasonable and the service was fair. A new waitress with limited experience but she was cute and tried hard. The atmosphere is pretty worn in this place and hasn't changed in years. This place is just OK."}
{"text":"Location: 4916 Yonge Street North York, ON M2N Price: $$ Service: Friendly  The food was not good. I had ordered chicken stripes and fries- needless to say it was not good at all. There are definitely better bar around the area that have better food and drinks.  The price is decent and the server was patient and friendly. I really wished I liked this bar but it wasn't good at all in my personal opinion. The poor server was the only person that was there at night. She had to manage bar and dinning herself. I didn't mind the wait at all, but I was really disappointed in the food.   Verdict: You're better else where"}
{"text":"The food was horrible. I ordered the Guinness Steak Pie and I'm pretty sure it was one of those microwavable meals you get from Loblaws. It was flat as a pancake and bland. Only one waitress to service the entire bar and restaurant on game day as well. She was great but really wished food was better."}
{"text":"We went to the Curach pub for dinner. It is an Irish bar situated in a row of restaurants. The restaurant is tastefully decorated. The service and food can be uneven. We have been here numerous times. The food is affordable and the place is mostly empty and quiet. It is never busy.  This time I ordered the spicy Italian penne. The dish was okay, but the cheese had a bitter taste to it. My friend thought her dish was okay.  Would we go back? Probably since the restaurant is comfortable. It is quiet and empty and the staff is not pushing us out to leave."}
{"text":"It's a simple bar. Their brunch is simple, and has a tasty \"greasy diner\" vibe to it. And it's inexpensive; toast with eggs, sausage, bacon and fries is $7 on weekends."}
