{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and we found this place on yelp. Food its Delicious. Big portions for a good price. Definitely i need to stop to this place before returning home."}
{"text":"Once again, the notion of \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurants having the best authentic food rings true.  And hole-in-the-wall this place is (thank goodness)!  I ordered carne asada tacos and al pastor tacos as well.  Very well seasoned.  I lean more towards the al pastor, in my opinion.  People not familiar with authentic Mexican food call them \"street style\", which is really just a real Mexican taco (two small grilled corn tortillas, meat, and cilantro and onions).    I also felt extra hungry and ordered a burrito of al pastor meat.  So, let me back up a little.  Usually, you order a burrito and they always throw fillers, like rice and beans (sometimes lettuce - yuck).  This place gives you an enormous burrito filled with meat, onions, and cilantro, and all for around $5.  Really great value, as two people could easily split this monster (bigger than Chipotle, and it's all meat).  I would have given 5 stars, but unfortunately there was a large piece of fat in the al pastor burrito, which I normally wouldn't mind, but it was hard fat.  Oh, btw, the chips and salsa were outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole-in-the-wall Taco Burrito Mexican food always good there eat their at least 3 to 4 times a month carne asada by the pound tortillas fixings come home make your own awesome deal"}
{"text":"It's as authentic as I've found in Arizona. Small crap shack with good tacos. Not the best looking restaurant but the food is good. Just wish someone would keep up with the cleanliness."}
{"text":"5 stars for the tacos! It's ambiance meh, but you'll be staring at your food so who cares!"}
{"text":"An amazing family resturant where they take great pride in serving traditional recipes. Simply delicious"}
{"text":"El Rinconcito defines lowbrow dining.  Honestly, your average diner would probably walk in and then turn around and head back out the door.  This is no frills slumming.  Flies were buzzing all around but I opted to man up and brave the pests.  Some tables and a mess of chairs awaited me in an old run down structure.    I ordered a grande asada taco and pambazo.  To my dismay there was no pork available so many menu items were not possible to order.  The food was good.  I didn't care for the pambazo but I had never tried it (or heard of it for that matter) and wanted to try something new.  It's a mix of chorizo and potato with cheese and lettuce served on a sandwich soaked in a red chili sauce (be advised this is very messy).  Win some, lose some with new experiences.  The taco was excellent and rivals that offered by Tacos Atoyac.  They served it with a side of red and green salsas.  Amazing salsa!  This isn't your average weak salsa.  It has a great kick.  The major downside here was the service.  Not attentive and I grew frustrated waiting on my check.  My plates had been cleared away, I had an empty Coke bottle and four different employees kept walking past, saying nothing to me.  I even told my waitress that I was finished.  With no plans for the evening I decided to wait and see how long it would take.  After 20 minutes I just got up and asked for the check.  Being my first visit I cannot say if this is normal here.  While annoying I'd give them another shot as the food was very good.  I'd say it's well worth a visit if your crave cheap and tasty Mexican eats.  Just be warned that service might leave some to be desired and the place itself is a dump.  Personally, the latter does not bother me but might be for others.  It has \"character\" as they say."}
{"text":"I love this little wall in a hole restaurant.  It's probably sunny slope's best kept secret for Mexican food.  It's hard to find authentic Mexico City food in Phoenix.  I had tacos and a quesadilla and want to try other foods next time.   Don't expect typical Northern Mexico food here.  The quesadillas are not your average.  Be adventurous and try something new."}
{"text":"Giving them 4 stars because the food was great but the customer service could be better. We have tried a lot of places but nowhere has been as good as this place for Mexican food. I would've added guacamole to my tacos but I didn't know they came without it. Definitely would go back and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Coming here for years, great place for tacos. Here are my favorites:  cabeza - meat from the cow's head. Fatty and tender, very good. lengua - cow tongue. Leaner, and delicious.  tripas - tripe. Made from the cow's stomach chamber. Or one of them, anyway. Took some time (few years) to build up the courage to try this, and I'm glad I did.   Cabeza and lengua are slow cooked for hours, and are very tender. I think tripas are just fried, but not sure. They're a little saltier, and taste great.  Each taco comes on two tortillas, and are actually two tacos. Or you can just eat it as one taco. They come with lime, salsa, cilantro and chopped onions. Squeeze the lime on the meat, add the salsa, cilantro and onions - and it's the fucking bomb. Add some Mexican coke or Fanta, and no quiero Taco Bell!  Look, you can get the \"traditional\" meats as well - carne asada, carnitas, suadero, etc... but live a little, eat some face."}
{"text":"So much love for this place, I had the large Pastor tacos, and a fanta... You betcha I'll be back! I grew up going to taco place in Hood River by the same name. This place is fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came back today to try the carne asada torta because the pictures look so money.  It came out to 7 bucks and was probably about 7 lbs.  A buck a pound isn't bad.  But it was a mess.  A real sloppy mess.  There was a couple pounds of cheese a pound of carne asada that was just thrown on top of the bun.  It was literally impossible to pick it up.  I had to eat it with a fork like a dip stick.  Tortas are supposed to be sandwiches that you can easily pick up and eat.  This thing was a monstrosity.  It had tomato, lettuce, mayo, beans, jalapenos, meat, and cheese, on a bun that was half the size it should have been to hold all of it.  The bun was soggy.  The veggies were not fresh and the only thing I could taste was the white cheese.    I don't know if it is because of Los reyes de la torta but it seems everyone wants to make the worlds biggest torta.  Make me one I can pick up and eat with dignity with some quality ingredients for 5 bucks instead of a Fear Factor one for 7.  Imagine having to eat a sandwich with a fork because they threw on 5 lbs of toppings.  Makes no sense to me.  I wouldn't recommend this place or come back again.   Original Review: El Rinconcito redefines hole in the wall.  When you pull up you will really think you are in Mexico.  The outside is tore up and next to some shotty looking apartments that your kids would have nightmares trick or treating at.  It is directly east of the park located on 12th St and Dunlap.  The inside isn't much better but is fairly clean.  It's a bare bones and basic set up. Half a dozen picnic tables and an out dated menu on the wall.  There are menus on the counter with current prices.  It's so basic inside that there is not even a TV with the usual telenovelas playing.  The menu is also pretty basic.  Tortas, burros, tacos, and tostadas.  I ordered four tacos so I could get a good sample of what they have to offer.  1 carne asada, 1 tripas, 1 al pastor, and 1 cabeza.  The waitress/hostess brought me out a green and a red salsa (no chips) which looked very basic as well. Picture the liquid consistency and ingredients of a Filibertos salsa with more pepper seeds.  5-10 minutes later my food arrived.  The four tacos combined filled up a regular sized styrofoam plate.  They were well topped for the size of them with meat, cilantro, white onion, and one lime cut in half in the middle of it all.     In the order I had them: The al pastor was a solid effort.  Nicely marinated and had good chunks of pork and was steaming hot.  The tripas were cooked exactly how I like them.  Crisp but not over done and cut into nice bite size chunks.  The carne asada was room temp, full of fat, chewy, and tasted reheated.  The cabeza also didn't taste fresh at all, wasn't hot, and had some off flavors that was hard to pin point but made me believe the meat may have been bad.  The meal came out to about 7 bucks and overall left me unsatisfied with more to desire.  I don't think I will return to try more of the menu and wouldn't sign off as a must try.  If you are a taco buff and looking for a new spot to add to the belt I would strongly recommend sticking to the al pastor and tripas and far away from the carne asada and cabeza.  There are much better places to get your fix at.  Warning: This place is CASH only, no wifi, no TV, straight dive joint that you will want to either eat quick and get out or take it to go."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican place in town! Small hole in the wall place but I have been going to this place for years now. The owner is an amazing guy and so are the staff. The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Ambiance - BASIC!  FOOD - Phenomenal!  The amount of Carne Asada in the small and large taco versions was enormous - price was VERY reasonable - the size and quality of the corn quesadillas   (I had the mushroom and added Carne Asada - and tons of the cilantro, onion, lime juice, and some of the red and green salsas all brought to the table in large quantity.  The Horchata was great - light on the sugar - with plenty of taste.  Anna our waitress provided great service and was very patient with a lot of questions - ready to go bk again...."}
{"text":"I found this place just by driving to my new job and feeling adventurous! I have tried a new thing each time. The green sauce is VERY spicy and I LOVE it!  It is worth a drive to the Sunnyslope area! :)"}
{"text":"Though this place truly looks like a dive, I had high expectations - for the food, at least - because of a glowing review I read in one of the local journals. The place looks a tad decrepit and while the tables look clean, their surfaces did have a bit of a sticky feel to them. On one occasion I had the huaracha recommended by the review I read. It was a generous portion of food and it tasted good, though it was a bit on the dry side. On a second visit, this time with my friend Rand R., I ordered a variety of street tacos - al pastor, carne asada, carnitas, and chorizo. They were very good, especially when you add the salsa offered on the side. The horchata I ordered with the tacos was good and was the perfect  accompaniment fo the tacos. In all, my dining experiences here were A-OK, though I'd rather go to Tacos Atoyac for similarly-priced  but higher-quality food ... and tables with a cleaner feel."}
{"text":"I can't believe this gem has no reviews.  I stopped by America's Taco Shop the other night expecting something similar to what I get at El Rinconcito.  No comparison whatsoever.  The carne asada tacos here are far superior and much for sizeable.  Sure the place isn't nearly as fancy, but the food is excellent.  The owners are friendly but you will likely need to brush up on your Spanish before you go.  I love this place."}
{"text":"It is always difficult to find a legitimate Mexican food place. I've been to various places, and they have all let me down. There was another restaurant, 'Los Reyes De La Torta', that came close, but this is by far the most authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten (in the States).  The tacos are good. Really good. My absolute favorite, and most often messed up at other establishments, are the cabeza tacos. They really stand out. If you're like tortas, their Cubana is really good too.  Couple that with cheap fold up tables and a nearby Laundromat and you'd swear you're in Mexico (it sure felt that way for me). You can take the experience a step further by drinking from the glass bottle sodas that they have.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The epitome of \"hole in the Wall\" as most of us say it, \"El Rincocito\", takes the corner as its name means, of a tiny strip mall that shares a parking lot of a condo complex. This strip mall consists of a small convenient store, a laundromat and the taco shop. When you look at the outside of the taco shop, a plain white building with a simple blue sign, It doesn't seem like much. It's a small spot that fits the kitchen that practically opens up to a single picnic bench inside. Outside are a couple more picnic tables and a makeshift condiment table. The menu is simple, but has the spanish to english translation of it's items. They have tacos, burritos, tortas and soups. I decided on 2 carne asada tacos. They have two sizes, small and large. I get the small. When they come out the meat is sizzling and you can smell the corn tortilla. The sizzling morsels of meat look delicious and are mounds on my plate on top of the four corn tortillas. They give you a plate of cilantro, onions, radish and some limes all freshly cut and smell amazing! I take one of the corn tortillas put some meat on it. I start to layer the cilantro, onions, and radish and the colors of the layers look beautiful. I squeeze a bit of lime to top it off. Now for the bite! All the flavors send my mouth on a trip! It's so fresh, refreshing, and tatses great! Definitely the closest to a taco shop in mexico I have ever had! The two small carne asada tacos actually had enough for four. they give you a good amount of meat that is enough for the four corn tortillas they also give you. The same goes for the large tacos.The price to portion ratio is really good. Also, they have two types of salsa, red and green. Unfortunately my stomach can't handle spicy foods and I didn't wanna ruin my story so I waited to put it in the end :) The service is great and usually it's the same 2 cooks.They do speak broken english, but definitely try to use what little they know. They have a tip jar so be sure to tip them!"}
{"text":"You look at this place from the outside and you wouldn't think much of it, much at all.  Actually, your subconsciousness would probably just have you look past it and not notice it at all.  But like my buddy's friend told him one day, look for the place that looks sort of run down with a lot of cars in front, they typically have the best food.  Following that advice, looking for food, we pulled a U-turn, went back and parked.  We were going to get take out until we heard the chips and salsa were free.  Budgeting and maximizing caloric intake, you know how that goes.  Place was hotter than all can be (the 2 a/c window units couldn't keep up), but we shrugged it off like the manly men we were and parked our arse.    The waitress was really friendly and helpful in explaining all the stuff they make, and the best part about it is that it's made fresh - chips, salsa, guac, etc.  This place is the real deal when it comes to mexican food.  It just goes to show you how most all places bend and give in, abandoning their tradition, just to meet the \"needs\" of the American people.  Or shall I call it ignorance?"}
{"text":"Super nice staff and the food is really good.  Definately a hidden gem in SunnySlope."}
{"text":"the restaurant is open during construction, though i'm not sure it really should be. it was very noisy, dirty and they were out of 3 things we tried ordering including tinga and lengua which are staples to have at a mexican street taco restaurant.   the \"chicos\" tacos were street taco size and the bigger tacos were huge. what we did have had great flavor. used mexican cheeses, shredded lettuce and the housemade salsas are on point.  will try it once more hopefully after construction they will offer a full menu.   they had a credit card machine, not cash only."}
{"text":"Our waiter Stars, provided excellent service and the food was great. He claimed he was from outer space, but I'll leave that up to you to decide Would recommend crushing margs with your meal. The max number they will serve you is three but they each have 3 shots in them, so it gets the job done and then some. The food was delicious and would definitely recommend to friends. Neat scenery too!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the quality of the food and the cleanliness is far from what it used to be.  Makes me sad but I have to say I won't be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Another of Phoenix New Times Ten Best Tacos in Phoenix.  A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  Another bare bones establishment that I approached with great expectations. Ordered the recommended Suadero Tacos and they came served in soggy tortillas (unforgiveable to my mind) to begin this less than fabulous experience. Very little taste to the Tacos so I found myself pouring on the hot sauce.  Will NOT return!"}
{"text":"Damned good tortas, quesadillas, and tacos.  Not much to look at, but the food makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"I ordered a huarache de tinga with grilled onions instead of raw. Tinga is chicken marinated in a bit of vinegar and seasoned in other spices. A huarache is like a huge thick corn tortilla that is filled with a thin layer of beans then it is topped topped with whatever you order. Absolutely delicious!!!! Go! Order it! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday(10/29) after a long online search for authentic Puro D.F. style suadero tacos. I was NOT disappointed! They make them just like my favorite spot back home in Dallas. The meat was tender but crisped a little on the outside and the meat and accompaniments of onion cilantro lime and sauce were very abundant. The staff was so super friendly, they even brought us over a big sample of their lamb meat which was also excellent and cooked just right. I can't rave enough about this place, and even though I don't visit my parents here often I will make sure to be back when I come. My parents have already made this a regular spot of theirs. Thank you guys so much for your wonderful food and friendly service, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is the cats meow for authentic Mexican food! Unfortunately what it lacks in creature comfort's it gains in authenticity. This place makes you feel like you just walked in to the real deal Street restaurant in Mexico! Stop by for the real deal!"}
{"text":"This is legit Mexican food. I got the asada quesadilla and my girlfriend got pastor tacos with sides of beans and rice. Everything was very good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Kind of torn on this place. I have had some good food here but the place inside leaves a lot to desired. It seems as though even if the smallest effort went into cleaning this place up you would see a drastic change. Not sure why this is not being done. It is one of the weirdest environments you will ever eat in. The place has not changed in years. It always feels dirty and unkept. Not sure why the effort is not being put forth. The food prices are a little high considering the environment. If they did clean the place up and make it more inviting, I know they could attract more people.   4 stars for the food, 1 for the experience inside, get food to go if you order from here."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a taco from the beef boiled off the head of a cow?   Cabeza carnitas tacos served here were pretty damn good even tho seeing a skull on a butcher block is unusual for me.   I guess I enjoy tacos, all types of tacos."}
{"text":"If you have restaurant \"spider senses,\" this place will set 'em a-tinglin'.  From the nondescript facade, tile floor, formica tables and dull fluorescent lighting, you know this is only about the food. The huaraches are amazing, the guac and fixin's as fresh as can be. Muy autentico. Try the cornflower squash and mushroom quesadilla. Bring cash, your own beer and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yo... this place is a good as it gets for street style tacos Y burritos... The pork al Pastor is beyond top notch and is typically being cooked in the parking lot on a spinning spit, with pineapple atop it. The pastor is where its at, but the Carne Asada is beyond dope, as well. The salsa comes HOT and that's it. If you are looking for gringo tacos, please go elsewhere and leave the true southwestern mexican fare, for those of us that are looking for the right stuff. Atmosphere is for snowbirds and snobs... Here, you will find some tables inside a small building while the cooking happens on the front porch... That's as good as it get's and this place is all business. All tacos served with heaping plates of onion, limes, cilantro and radish... Grab a mexican Coke and you are good to go. My favorite spot for Tacos in the valley, though the Sunnyslope location is pretty far from me.. when I can, I will make the trip, just for the tacos and no frills dining."}
{"text":"Tienen el mejor Barbacoa y consome en todo Arizona! Los Sabados y Domingos. Recomiendo ir temprano porque se acaba!"}
{"text":"This place is unbeatable if you are looking for the BEST street tacos in Phoenix plus amazing quesadillas, tostadas, huaraches and sopas and you aren't concerned with ambiance (the restaurant is comfortable but very basic). Everything is hot, fresh and delicious and they don't skip on the extras. We have eaten there a couple of times recently and, along with our meal, they brought fresh chips and salsa (decious but hot- not for the mild salsa lover), a plate of limes, fresh cilantro, cucumbers and radishes plus another plate with grilled chilis and cactus paddles. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food remains the same but the service has gotten down hill.  I was a regular here and I was once over charged for an item so I thought it was ok being that it was only a couple dollars.  However, one night when my husband and I went to diner and our desert was not charged on accident, the owner went after our waiter and went through our table to check all the dishes and leftover food.  My husband and I were appalled and (needless to say) will NOT be going back.  It's a shame because the food is decent but the owner's demeanor and Management is HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"I've only had the street tacos here and they are delicious the price you can't beat range from 325 to 375 for the grande tacos  Giant portions I recommend to you. The Carne Asada"}
