{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it wasn't that busy. One thing I do appreciate about it is that it's not an overly raucous environment. It might be just because I'm not that young any more, but it's a comfortable environment where you can socialize and enjoy the food and service.  Unfortunately, the food leaves a lot to be desired. In general, we found everything to be overly salty, to the point where it pretty much ruined the taste of everything. The wait time for us to get our food was really bad, and it wasn't even a full restaurant. Just for our Okonomiyaki, it was probably a good 30 minute wait. Luckily, we did get other parts of our order in the mean time, but there is no reason for something like that to take that amount of time to prepare.  The menu is a little bit limited when compared to some of the other Izakayas that have been popping up around Toronto. I don't mind a smaller menu, but in order to make up for lack of variety, there needs to be better execution of these menu items so that they are more tasty and less salty."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Wednesday night and there was only 2 other tables apart from us. The waitress was super friendly but the food portion was super small for their price. She (or the chef) forgot our chicken wings and they came out super late. Green tea which normally costs next to nothing was charged at $2.50 per cup. 2 fried chicken winglets for $4.50 and that's not including tax. Such a rip off, this was my first Izakaya meal too so I was put off this type of cuisine, but my friend said he spent $50 for 2 people at Guu (which included beer) and he was full afterwards. My meal at Nejibee was $39.50 for 2 people (no alcohol) and we were still hungry after that."}
{"text":"Deep Fried Chicken Wing was their recommendation on the menu but it turned out bad. It is fried, just that it was pre-fried. It was soggy and tasteless. It was literally fried chicken wing without seasoning. The rest of the food was ok, not great. Would not return again"}
{"text":"3/15/13 edit: It's not as busy now that they're through the first week. Service and speed has significantly improved. Adding an extra star and edited comments accordingly.  Layout is not the best. We sat at the bar (along with ~10 other patrons), and my eyes watered from the smoke.  1st up: Otsumami Cabbage. Literally, it's a $4.50 bowl of a couple of cabbage leaves in sesame oil. Nothing about it stands out, and little effort was put into the presentation.  2nd: 2 pork belly skewers (we ordered 4). It's pork with salt. It's tasty, but nothing else to note.  Keichan-Yaki was pretty good. Tender chicken, stir fried well and was very flavourful.  Got our yakisoba next. Based on the texture, I think they used ramen noodles, and they were surprisingly fresh. I'm partial to ramen, so I actually really enjoyed this.  Overall, with so many great Izakaya options in Toronto nowadays, it's really hard to give this place a great review, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by the past reviews of Nejibee on here.  Perhaps they attended the place during an off-night because I went last night and I thought it was great.  The restaurant was fairly busy but my friends and I were greeted hospitably and led to our seats within minutes upon our arrival.  Granted, the overall seating arrangements were not very spacious but I'd much rather choose this enviroment over others such as Guu (i.e. their music is so loud nowadays, you practically have to scream in order to have any conversation whatsoever)!!  In terms of food, our table ordered an assortment of items from the jalepeno chicken to miso rice balls to their okonomiyaki.  Everything tasted delicious and their portions were fairly generous.  The prices were adequate and on par to what all izakayas would normally charge.      The conclusion: This is one of my new favourite places and I will definately be heading back."}
{"text":"Although it is small and kind of hidden, I kind of appreciated that about it. I happened upon it because I was walking by and kind of live in the area. The staff were all very friendly, and I love that, if sitting at the bar, you can watch them make your food, and they hand it to you straight off the grill. Right now the menu is kind of limited, but I was told it's only about 30% of what it will be, so the limited menu thing shouldn't be an issue anymore.  As far as the food went, I got Okonomi-yaki at the suggestion of the waitress, and was very pleased with the decision. I tried a pork skewer too, and have to say all the food tasted great. The ambiance is nice and personal, and makes you kind of feel like the place is your little secret, which I like.   It should be kept in mind that the place has only been open less than two weeks, so there are some things that come with being a new restaurant (like the developing menu). I don't know how well they're going to do in that secluded location, but I'm glad i stumbled upon it, and hope that it's around for a while."}
{"text":"When you walk into Nejibee Izakaya you will notice the minimalist approach to their decor.  It's no Guu, Fin, or the over ostentatious Don Don Izakaya so it's not a particularly rustic feeling.  In a segment that is increasingly dominated by heavy weight name brand Izakaya's who can throw their financial might into investing for a rustic end to end experience I'm not sure why Nejibee choose the minimalist styling. But few people I would gather come to marvel at decor so let's talk about the food.  The kindest thing I can say about my experience tonight was that the food was decidedly uninspiring and in some cases downright sloppy.  After a 20 minute wait for a table my dinner partner and I were presented with a very small menu.  In total there were around 15 items you could choose from.  We ordered an Okonomiyaki, Croquette, Onigiri rice ball with seasoned pork, and deep fried and salted chicken wings (2).    The disorganization amongst the staff was very apparent as they often would need to consult with each other while holding multiple dishes before delivering them to their respective tables. After what seemed like a 10 minute wait we received our first dish which was the Jalape√±o Chicken... Of which neither myself or my dinner partner had ordered.  Unlike other Izakaya restaurants I've visited before there was no \"Thank you for waiting\" or a quick announcement of what the dish was.  It was hastily plopped onto our table before the server walked away.  We both poked at it for a bit wondering if they were the chicken wings we had ordered before I finally flagged down another server who looked at it and then told us to wait a minute while she walked back to the kitchen and ask. The server came back after a few consultations and announced what it was; the jalapeno chicken, to which we replied that we hadn't ordered it... So away goes out first dish which was brought back to the kitchen and immediately brought back out to the right table behind us.    Another 5 minutes later our Onigiri rice ball arrived.  A 15 minute wait for literally rice made into a triangle on a sheet of seaweed with some seasoned pork on the side.  Ok.  After taking a quick bite, it did indeed taste good however I can't really give them points for that because even grocery store Onigiri can taste good.  It's very difficult to butcher a dish as simple as Onigiri.  While eating, our second dish came which was the croquette.  It came with the standard teriyaki sauce.  It was hot, fresh, and tasted as one would expect.  Nothing mind blowing but not disappointing either.  Another 10 minutes passed as we waited for our chicken wings and Okonomiyaki.  We watched in angst as a random server delivered our chicken wings to another table that hadn't ordered anything in quite a while, watched them poke at it and eat one before alerting the server that it wasn't there's.  The server picks up the dish and then comes round my back and drops the dish onto our table.... With 1 chicken wing missing and walks away. We ordered 2.  Then another server delivers a dish of 4 chicken thighs over to our table (of which we did not order) and she left just as quickly.  I had to flag yet another server down to ask what it was to which I was told it was our order of chicken wings.  Alright.  They weren't but whatever.  After another 5 minutes I finally flagged the original server down and inquired as to where my Okonomiyaki was to which she reassured me that it was coming soon.  In fairness it looked like all people who ordered sizzling plates were waiting for their order so the kitchen was obviously backed up.  Our neighbors also asked where their order was.  So we continued to wait.  Finally it came and was by far and large the absolute worst Okonomiyaki I have ever had.  The bottom was so burnt it was welded to the plate.  The seasoning on the bottom was so strong and salty it was hard to eat.  The katsuobushi (bonito flakes) was very sparingly scattered in patches over the so called Okonomiyaki. It looked like what I would describe as the Bermuda Triangle on a plate.  3 points.  I couldn't even tell what was inside the Okonomiyaki.  Fish? Cabbage?  Crispy burnt on the outside watery on the inside.  Not creamy like you would find at other quality restaurants.  Conclusion is that Nejibee has a lot of work to do.  I am truly and honestly hoping that the poor quality of the food was due to the opening weekend and that they will figure out what works and doesn't work.  I really want to like them but based on my experience tonight I would have to say that they are not yet ready for the demanding tastes of Toronto.  With top quality established Izakaya restaurants in Toronto grooming people to expect a higher standard for Izakaya, Nejibee is a relatively unimaginative and lacklustre performer.  If you are looking for a good Izakaya experience, go back to Guu for now while Nejibee sorts out their growing pains."}
