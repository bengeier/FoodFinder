{"text":"I've had Italian that I would pay extra for, unfortunately Canelli's doesn't fit amongst those restaurants. The food isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good enough for what they charge. I ordered shrimp Alfredo, and with five pieces of shrimp and bland-flavored sauces, the $22 price tag seems extortionate"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner and got the \"special\"  It was a fettuccini pasta with shrimp, beef and a lobster sauce. The sauce was good but there were no lobster in the sauce itself. The shrimp was cooked well but the beef was over cooked, lacked any flavor, and was over powering the dish. There were 3 shrimp and a few pieces of spinach.  I was very disappointed, seeing as it was a $23 plate."}
{"text":"I had an unpleasant experience at Canelli's.   I came to eat here after I read excellent reviews about Canelli's on Yelp. But after my first and last experience at this restaurant, I am not returning ever again.  Canelli's offers \"house bread\" like most restaurants do. The problem is that they REUSE the bread. Here's what happened:   On my way to using Canelli's washroom, I noticed that they had a bread basket on the counter near the washroom stairs. I wondered to myself why they hadn't thrown out the two pieces of bread that was just sitting in the basket (It looked like another customer had some other pieces already). It didn't take me too long to realize why when they served that EXACT same pieces of bread on my table along with two new ones (they felt different: two of them stale and other two somewhat fresher). The fact that there was also an opened butter and dirty linen napkin confirmed that they had reused their bread.  Honestly, I wanted to talk to the manager but we had already ordered food and my companion didn't want me to make a fuss about it.   I'm posting the evidence that they reused their bread -- please refer to the gallery.  I lost my appetite and only ate one third of my food. I might be biased but the food wasn't that good either - it wasn't terrible but it wasn't worth the price and being served the reused bread. Also, the service was slow. It took me many tries to get their attention - I'm not sure if they were having a short meeting or conversation because everyone was gathered in the front area."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food and the only Italian food I've had in Brampton so far. The portions were nice and large. The pasta was full of flavour. I got the spicy sausage arriabiata and it full of spice.  The chicken con pollo had a really nice pesto flavour to it. It could've used a little less salt and more basil flavour though. Their pasta is much better than East Side Mario's.  The bread was crusty but it tasted somewhat stale as if it had been left out for too long. I'd come here again for the pasta."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth checking out if you want to stay local. The food is full of flavor, we had fried Calamari, salmon classic dish, the special spinach pasta with shrimp and their seafood pasta. Everyone I was with enjoyed their dish. I defiantly recommend this place for anyone who wants some wholesome Italian food."}
{"text":"Went in on a weekday - it happened to be their all you can eat pasta night special. Had the spaghetti with meat sauce. The portion was great and it was good. Price was decent too. Service was good. They allowed us to order a second bowl and take it home.  Also took the tiramisu home. That I didn't like.   Overall was a good experience and would return. They have specials Monday -Thursday night."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant, with fresh, quality ingredients. It's one of the best restaurants I've been too, and definitely one of my favourites."}
{"text":"It was 4 stars but . . . . We have always enjoyed coming to Canelli's over the past years.  The food is delicious.  We introduced it to many friends.  On this trip we weren't too hungry so we order a large Caesar salad, a large pizza and pasta with steak to share among 3 of us. Again very enjoyable.  Bread, olive oil and vinegar was brought over by the waitress.  A total of 4 thinly sliced pieces.  We asked for a bit more bread and was TOTALLY SUPRISED that the waitress told us that there will be a charge of $0.75!!! I've never come across this in all the restaurants around the world I've eaten in before.  I looked over at the table next to us.  There were also family of 3 and their bread basket contained 7-8 pieces of bread and the gentlemen overheard the waitress and was shocked too.  I told the waitress to go ahead and she brought back 6 very small thinly sliced pieces.  I did not complain but definitely turned us off . . . ."}
{"text":"Bread wish they had it warm so I could melt the butter. My chicken Alfredo and my son were not completely cook, so we bagged it for nuke option at home. I notice my daughter's dish pasta was the same. Her sauce and chicken was great. My wife fruit De Mare was spiced just right the best dish of the night. All three of us agreed. Calamari appetizer is decent. For family of 4 came out to $104 and we applied our $60 off wag jag that we bought for less than 30 which made out dinner to be roughly under $80 tip included.  My daughter and son liked it very much and won't be sharing their left over with their dad..."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Canelli's in a long while because, quite honestly, it just wasn't as good as it had been when it was first opened. In fact, we were disappointed  the last time we were there. Then we read on various review sites that it had changed ownership, and the reviews weren't great. Recently, reviews seemed to be better, so we decided to go tonight.  Our meal was fantastic. The service was good, the food was fresh and the prices very reasonable. If there were growing pains when the new owners took over, you'd never know it. It was busy, there was live music and it was a great evening. We will definitely put Canelli's back on our list of regular dining spots."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for our Valentine's dinner. They had a set menu for the evening which was no problem. For a valentine's dinner, it wasn't loud or overcrowded as some restaurants can feel on holidays or weekends. Decent wine selection and good food set this place apart from many other spots in Brampton."}
{"text":"On a Friday night, it was so empty which was nice because our food came out faster. I ordered the cheesy meat lasagne and the brushetta. They were both good but the sauce in the lasagne tasted a little off. Also got a discount with my yelp account!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok.  It could be great because they use fresh ingredients, but it's too damn salty.  I feel so bad saying that because the service was good and the bread was so freekin fresh!! I'm sorry, but it's just the truth.  Great potential, but an overall 3.  Minus all the salt, it would be a 5."}
{"text":"I like this place. The Penne a la Vodka is my standby, but their marinara sauce is great too.   It's about the same price as other Italian restaurants in Brampton. The portions are similar to other places. The quality is better though (at least in my opinion)"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening with a friend, it was kind of busy but we were seated quickly. While waiting we got 3 of the skimpiest pieces of bread that I may have ever received from a restaurant in my life.   Ordered bruschetta and the fruit de mare. Decided to save the extra one dollar that it cost to add cheese to the bruschetta, needless to say I regretted that decision, but it was decent nonetheless. Fruit de mare (sp?) was amazing though. Loved it! Had one mussel that was kind of fishy but besides that it was a really enjoyable meal.   My friend ordered the chicken Alfredo and her first reaction was, \"I could have made it at home\" and \"the chicken is kind of hard\". Lol so try something else would be my recommendation."}
{"text":"Canelli's is one of our favourite sit-down places in Brampton.  We've been here a few times yet we always seem to get the same thing: Pasta Bellissimo and chicken parmesan.  The latter comes with a very generous serving of chicken, oozing with cheese and the spaghetti is saucy and delicious.  The pasta Bellissimo is mouth-watering to the last bite and doesn't even need the meat that comes with it (steak or chicken).    We usually get a small pizza to share and all the ones we've tried so far are made fresh and never fail to impress.  Must try one!  This is our go-to place for delicious Italian food!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some fine Italian dining and decided to give Canelli's a try. The restaurant wasn't really what I was looking for as it has more of a family style atmosphere. Booth type seating without table cloths or linen napkins etc. ordered a Caesar salad to start and chicken parmigiana. The Caesar was sub par with a powdered Parmesan cheese, a bland dressing, and one big crouton. I was dreading the main course but was pleasantly surprised with the chicken parmigiana. The sauce was rich and flavorful, the spaghetti al dente, and the chicken moist with a crispy coating.  The waiter offered freshly grated Parmesan and black pepper at the table for the mains (not sure why they don't have this on their Caesars) which we accepted.  The food was for the most part fairly good but considering the price point for our meal, I thought it was fairly  pricy for a family style restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered from Canelli's a few days ago through the app..skip the dishes. I ordered the sea food fast and fried calamari and a salad. The delivery was fast, AND THE FOOD WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD. The food was cooked to perfection. I'm ordering again today..just waiting till it opens."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to home and I have passed by this place a trillion times. I finally decided to eat here when one of my friends recommended eating here, since she comes here on a regular basis. I happened to pull up and get convenient parking right in front of the restaurant. It was fairly quiet with a couple of families there around 7pm on a weekday. We were seated immediately but the server took forever to come by and take our order. I'm assuming they thought my friend and I were having some deep convo and didn't want to interrupt? Anyway after 15 minutes later we got our drinks and placed our order. I happened to get pizza, I should've been a bit more adventurous but my moms out of town and I can't afford to mess up dinner because that's the only thing I'm having haha! We also grabbed the calamari, you can tell it was frozen calamari since it was a little more rubbery than usual but needless to say I was hungry and it tasted it good to me. The pizza came out within 5 minutes after the Calamari and it looked awesome. I got a small Hawaiian pizza and it was delicious. I should've paid more attention and checked if it was stone baked but I will definitely check for next time. I will come here again to try out the pasta entrées. This is your everyday Italian joint, just for some comfort food when your moms not cooking!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now with all difference sizes of groups and the food has always been wonderful.   Great portion sizes, good prices and the food is delicious. I removed a star because some of the servers seem to have an attitude unfortunately.   I highly suggest the chicken parm. Really nice big piece of chicken and it was one of the best chicken parms I have ever had.   This place is definitely good for larger parties as well. It's not usually too busy either so the food comes out quickly and hot.   Also they have special deals during the week including a date night special on Thursdays :)"}
{"text":"Definitely try their Pasta Bellissimo with steak, it is amazing! They use a delicious sherry oyster cream sauce on the pasta, which I have yet to find at any other italian restaurant. In fact, this pasta is one of the many reasons I keep coming back; My girlfriend orders it every time we visit, and she's never been disappointed.  I love this place! My favourite restaurant in Brampton! The staff are friendly and personable, the service quick and prompt, and the food is always amazing. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is great quality and the portions are great! We are vegetarian and there's so many amazing options. Came here for Mother's Day dinner and ordered Squash Ravioli, Spinach and Ricotta Manicotti, Eggplant Parmesan... they were delightful! Pauline our host was also very pleasant, friendly and brought us our food and drinks quickly. This is my go to Italian resto!"}
{"text":"I had originally given this restaurant 2 stars but reduced it to 1 following this response from Mina M - Business Owner at Canellis.   My original review: This used to be my favourite restaurant in Brampton for years but I stopped going bc the service sucks! I brought so many friends here and we used to have a great time there. But then the waitstaff changed and they don't even acknowledge regulars. Whelp- if you don't want my business I'll take it elsewhere.  Comment from Mina M. of Canelli's Italian Eatery Business Owner 1/29/2018:  Dear Lisa, Thanks for your review. But not sure where is this coming from since you didn't describe a bad experience or something wrong that one of our servers did with you. We know our regulars by name and by face. My main server has been here for over 10 years that works almost everyday. We appreciate all our guests whether you are a regular or not. If you choose to take your business somewhere that is your decision at the end of the day. Cheers!   My response: To go into the numerous times that my meals were delivered late, hosts barely acknowledging my party's existence in a mostly empty restaurant, the lack of customer service (I AM telling you) in addition to your apathetic response is exactly why you get one star. By acknowledgement I just mean a friendly hello and warm banter that makes people feel welcome. The service was good until the waitstaff had changed a while ago. There was one \"gentleman\" who had been there forever and he was obnoxiously rude. (Someone being a faithful employee doesn't translate to good service).  I'm kindly stating that your service needs work. There are plenty of new restaurants and I haven't seen your restaurant full in a LOOOOONG time."}
{"text":"Amazing food every time we go. Now a family favourite. Friendly and helpful staff. I recommend the Pasta Bellissimo with Steak. Great home made desserts. Best Italian restaurant in Brampton. Glad I don't live closer or I might never cook myself."}
{"text":"Hubby & I felt like trying out an Italian place tonight.  #Yelp has done it again! Very pleased with our visit from the ambience & service to the food and pricing .  Had the ravioli di Zucca and I was slightly concerned the goat & gorgonzolla cheese would be overpowering, but not at all. In fact from apetizer to the desserts, was quality and mild to the perfection of taste. I also noticed they had alot of repeat customers, greeting guests on first a name basis. Gots to be a good thing. Anway, least to say we will definately be coming back! Looking forward to trying out thursday date night for two for $40 . Oh and coffee & tea is unlimited which was pretty nice#twothumbsup #greatfood #greatservice #greatpeople"}
{"text":"Good Italian food. The calimari app was excellent, veal parmigiana was spot on. The tiaramisu was just ok, but overall this was a great experience. I'll be back my next time in town."}
{"text":"Best penne a la vodka I've ever tasted. Nice warm atmosphere and friendly staff. Love the bread that just keeps on coming. I have yet to have a bad experience here. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Canelli's is probably one of the best restaurants in Brampton. Family run on the site of what used to be Queen's Pizzeria (run by the same family), they have a typical Italian menu, executed really nicely.  The service is always attentive and friendly, and the turnover has been quite low over the years, which I take as a good sign in a restaurant.  They do a nice caesar salad with proper anchovy dressing and nice shaved parm, we've been pretty happy with most of their appetizers, too, though we inevitably end up back at the Calamari. Terribly cliché, I know, but tasty is tasty.  Their pizzas are good, but I inevitably end up with one of their pastas. If it's your first time and a rich pasta doesn't scare you, I heartily recommend the Pasta Bellisimo. Nice tagliatelle tossed in a lobster sherry cream sauce with mushrooms and (optionally) skirt steak. Non-traditional, very rich, but delicious. The spaghetti vongole (clams) was going to feature in this review, but they've recently taken it off the menu, sadly. The Penne alla Vodka is another star (pancetta and mushrooms were made to be in my mouth together.)  Reasonable prices all round (the Folonari Valpolicella is quite a palatable house red) and a decent cappuccino if you're into such things. Not a legend of the culinary world, but great, reliable, comfortable."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food.  The veal scallopini is delicious! Their appetizers are amazing and plentiful. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. We will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our first \"married\" valentines =D I know I live in Brampton, but for some reasons I never find myself eating out in Brampton. He made a great choice since it was local (down the street) and definitely not a East Side Marios.  But since we went on Valentines, it was a set menu we would only order off of, and my brother whose been there has told me the normal menu is much better and bigger.  We ordered 2 glasses of white, their Riesling was actually really good, my husband ordered it and I finished it since my chardonnay was only ok. lol  We had the mussels to share (yummy and good size portion) $10 Bread basket was yummy so we asked for extra to dip in the mussels.  I had the Pasta Bellisimo $18.00 tagliatelle, portobello mushrooms, garlic, fresh herbs in a sherry oyster cream sauce topped w/ grilled steak: YUM (big portion, I saved half for lunch which was still yummy on day 2)  My husband had the Mushroom Agnolotti $14.00 mushroom stuffed agnolotti, roasted garlic, sun dried tomatoes and asparagus in a white wine cream sauce. (Small portion, I know he's a big guy but also looked small to me and I'm all of 5 feet tall)  Funny story because he normally \"loves\" veal/chicken Parmigiana which the couple both had next to us and it was a huge skillet covered with pasta and meat Mmmm Next time we will get that for sure.  Brampton is known for many family owed Italian restaurant and i have to say Cannellis has got me itching to try the other ones.  The only negative thing was the service, although everyone was super nice, maybe cause it was valentines it was kind of hard to have our plates cleared and the bill delivered. hope this isn't the case normally."}
{"text":"Canellis may be worth a taste but is definitely not to die for...   Canellis is a large Italian restaurant with a nice casual environment.. Nothing too fancy.   The service wasn't the greatest, mind you we did have a very large group of people. Our party had arrived at 6 our order was not taken till 7 and our food did not come out until 8. Our server also did not bother to refill our waters until the middle of dinner when someone had asked.   The food looked great but was definitely missing some flavour. I ordered the pasta bellisimo.. It was very salty and the sauce was not creamy but was watery. Not only did I find my dish salty but that was the same complaint around the table.  Also to pay the bills we had to go up and ask for it. Gratuity was added however the server failed to mention that and a lot of our party ended up adding tip."}
{"text":"Worst service. They have no clue have to run private functions and a typical done in restaurant at once. No water, bread was extra and let's not forget dry! Pasta was under cooked. Chicken still pink and the prices sucked for the quality of food.   Total disappointment.  Staff not friendly every staff member looked at us sitting and waiting patiently for 35minutes before receiving a menu.   Owner/manager sat at hostess booth in his phone oblivious to the entire evening. Nevvvver again."}
{"text":"I came here with my family since we have been craving Italian food for a while, but we could not find any restaurants without a huge line up. We ordered the margarita pizza and the pasta primavera. The margarita pizza was unlike anything I have ever tasted. The cheese was perfectly done and the dough was very soft. The pasta primavera was one of the best pastas I have ever had. I believe the only other pasta I have had that was this good was the rabbit spaghetti from Cucina by Wolfgang Puck. The primavera was an amazing mix of vegetables and noodles. This place gave my family the satisfaction that they had desired. I will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Canelli's doesn't try to be as upscale as some of the downtown Brampton Italian restaurants. Their prices are a little lower and the food is still very good. Our usual was the seafood pasta."}
{"text":"The food more than makes up for their bland interiors.  Really one of the best Pizzas, even though it was vegetarian. The Lasagne was a good dish as well.  Service was quick and courteous.  Really one of the best Pizzas!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation on their website for two people on a Thursday at 6pm. There was really no point because when we got there, we were one of two tables lol.  They do give you a complimentary bread basket and olive oil/balsamic vinegar to dip. However, the bread wasn't warm and was a really basic type of bread, so I wasn't too interested in that. I ordered the small mista salad and the pollo parmigiana. My friend ordered the chicken Marsala. All food came out in a reasonable time. The mista salad had an interesting dressing. Might be too much for others but I enjoyed it. I wasn't crazy about the spaghetti that came with my meal. It tasted kind of artificial. The chicken was okay. I think the cheese was what made it tasty. My friend said she thought the chicken Marsala was okay. Service was good. Might return to try other items but there are better places in Brampton that offer tastier Italian dishes and for a better price."}
{"text":"The chicken parmesan was bland. The bellisimo was really good. Fried Calmari was just okay... Service was great. 3/5 for me."}
{"text":"There are some nice beer options and lots of vino to choose from. I had a nice pasta meal listed on the chalk board near the entrance. The staff was friendly and there is a pizza list that tempted me to stray from the pasta I had deliberately arrived to order.   The atmosphere would be great for a date or family meal. The noise is quiet enough for conversation but not so sterile that you are afraid to have a private discussion."}
{"text":"The best seafood risotto I`ve ever had. Shrimp, scallops, muscles, clams and topped with a lobster tail! Worth every penny. Service is fantastic. Owner definitely cares. Must try!"}
{"text":"What a great and unexpected find! the chef really knows what he is doing. From wine suggestions to food pairings, they really know their stuff. I was second guessnig between alfredo and arrabiata, he put together a rose sauce for me which was divine! We thought we'd have leftovers but...it was too good not to finish :)  Definitely worth repeating."}
{"text":"Had an Italian craving so I ordered takeout from lunch menu- Chicken Alfredo. I asked to add mushrooms for an additional cost. The food is great tasting, fresh, good portions and fast service. The waiters were very nice and added free complimentary french bread and butter. The only downside was that there was hardly any chicken...I will definitely return. Great value!"}
{"text":"This is the third or fourth time our family has come to Canelli's for a birthday dinner. After our first visit this restaurant quickly became one of our favourite Italian restaurants in Brampton. One of my fav dishes was the Risotto de Mare, my wife and I used to share a plate for two for an unbeatable price any where in the GTA, piled with various seafood and a whole grilled lobster to boot. Unfortunately tonight it wasn't on the menu, otherwise I would have ordered it again. It didn't matter, as I browsed the menu for other equally tempting dishes. Our party of five ordered three different antipasti dishes, for the mains we ordered Chicken Parmesan, Stuffed Sole, Fettuccine Alfredo  with Chicken, pasta bellissimo, and a personal size pizza. We topped it off with vanilla ice cream and tiramisu. Everything was as expected and more, fresh, flavourful, big portions, fast service, an attentive waiter, and relaxing atmosphere. Without drinks it costed under $140 (tips extra), thanks to 10% off from Yelp! We will be back and next time we will try the panna cotta which was sold out tonight."}
{"text":"Went there with family and friends for a celebration dinner. Ordered Calimari and Bruschetta as apps. The calamari felt like it was frozen and not done well, but the bruschetta was delicious. Also ordered individual pasta dishes. The portions were huge and the flavours were nice - uncomplicated basic Italian. The prices were average ($16-22) an entree and because we used a Groupon we were able to save quite a bit on our total bill. They also have a small patio for outdoor dining.  Would recommend it for those in the area!"}
{"text":"Living in Brampton there is some limited choices when it comes to Italian food options.  Don't get me wrong there is excellent Italian food here, but there is some that are just standard Italian fare...  This is one of these places...Canelli's is centrally located in Brampton (Queen St and Kennedy) in a strip mall.    The restaurant has a patio, which is a rare sight to see on the busy retail industrial district of Queen St, it is also nice and spacious with lots of seating.  Large or small parties shouldn't be and issue here.  Open kitchen style with full view of the service area.  Service here is good...friendly staff and acceptable service.  I have been here twice as my wife's mother likes the Caprese salad.  Price are in line with most restaurants in the area and portion sizes are quite good.   I have had the Risotto Verde (spinach, roasted red peppers, red onions) which was quite good and very filling and the Manicotti..lots of cheese and tomato sauce baked in a modest portion.  Lasagna, Pizza, salads...pretty much the standard fare.  If your palate is hankering for some Italian food with good portion sizes and resonable prices..Canelli's might be what your looking for."}
{"text":"Good restaurant..was family run but now bought out by another person. We've eaten here 6-8 times, so I would consider us a regular. Went for dinner on Aug 15/14. We had a WagJag Coupon that was expired the day before that they honoured it for the value of the WagJag $19.00 but not for the extended value $40.00. I thought that considering we are regulars (the waiter knows our name) we should have been extended the courtesy of the full coupon, but we weren't. The food quality is solid but it's not a WOW. I haven't eaten anything here that I sent back or would right home about. Their pasta does stand out...their Penne Con Pollo is really good & is a must try."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday. Food was really good. Price is very appropriate for what you get. Service is kinda there.... it all depends on who is your waiter. The first person that took our order looked mad/angry, not very friendly. Pesce a la Griglia was was very good. It had a lot of seafood. The escargo was so so ....just butter and garlic...too much butter. We had to get the Pasta Bellisimo since everyone was recommending it. It was good but a little too sweet for my taste. Good thing I was sharing with a friend. The portion was appropriate enough for two if you get an appetizer to share. The pizza is really good. must try"}
{"text":"Canelli's is a family favourite that keeps us coming back even with the trek from Sauga! It's without a doubt that Canelli's is one of my favourite Italian restaurants. We always bring family friends here, and they're always impressed!  First things first, the appetizers here are great. There is a ton of variety and all of them are very shareable. My favourites have to be the bruschetta and the meatball sliders.   As far as the entrees go, the pizza and pasta are very delicious. It's evident that the ingredients they use are of premium quality, and it makes all the difference for the tastebuds! But my most favourite dish of all time is the Pasta Bellisimo. The sauce is super rich and creamy, the pasta is always cooked with that slight resistance, and the mushrooms are filled with flavor.  It's a great Italian place with a cozy ambiance. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Had a bad service the first time my husband and I came.  The owner addressed the issue on the spot and made an adjustment to our bill to compensate for the service we received.    I decided to give this place another try with a friend (who also had a bad 1st experience) we have been coming here many times without further issues.    Our favorite dish is the Chicken Parm with Spaghetti. The portion is huge!  Another one to mention is their Penne a la Vodka.  I like mine with mushrooms and that was no problem at all. Another favorite is the grilled calamari on mixed greens or the fried calamari... both FRESH! Pizza is made with fresh ingredients. You can't go wrong with any selections here.  I feel the need to add my thoughts based on some reviews I have read regarding Canelli's.    I have read some negative reviews on here... and I can agree w/ the slow service from order taking, bringing the drinks and complimentary bread w/ olive oil, balsamic vinegar mix, entrée and the throughout dining experience with a waiter/ waitress was not pleasant.  This was the issue we had on our 1st visit.  However, I have been dining in and taking out now over 20+ times since and I have nothing but positive things to rave about.  I am very fair rating and entry of my reviews.  To give Canelli's a 5*, I truly believe in second tries for those who has had bad experiences.  So if you are giving this place a second chance and the experience is better... Edit your review (update)   For any new customers who are thinking of trying... give it a try.  If there are any issues during your dining experience, share them w/ the floor manager, owner... and see if they can handle the situation.  If you choose to Yelp... share your WHOLE experience so other's can make a sound decision."}
{"text":"Great food and our waitress Pauline was helpful with recommendations. We started with the bruschetta, which was really nice. I had the penne vodka and it was delicious, also big portions. My boyfriend had the traditional pizza and it was also very good. Will definitely go back to try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! I love Italian food and this place is amazing! The best seafood risotto I'm ever tasted! Their portion sizes are more than generous (Italian style) and the food is flavorful. The wine list is well priced and has a variety of choices with some familiar wines. Everyone is always smiling and welcoming. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and accommodating. The place stayed opened way after closing time with no fuss what so ever . Food was great . The traditional pizza , garlic bread and pasta with meat sauce .. If you like spice u must must must must request their home made hot sauce !! It's out of this world !!!!!"}
{"text":"Canellis Marsala Chicken is TO DIE FOR!! I order it at least once a week and Tiramisu for dessert. So delicious!"}
