{"text":"Viet House is very good.  The food was fresh, well-cooked and flavorful.  The restaurant was clean and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Ok. Simple. This is not for a lack of trying on my part, or any decor, service-related part of this restaurant, but this review is purely food based. Particularly of the menu variety. Because a pho soup is definitely made using a meat stock ( along with meat in the soup ). We know that, we really do. (us vegans that is!)  That's the problem with listing a pho in the vegetarian part of the menu. When you use a BEEF stock, it no longer is a vegetarian offering. Please stop misinforming through your menu's listing."}
{"text":"Good service and pleasant owners. 'hue' pho was good and the assorted pho was delish. Tried their spring rolls and grilled pork bun- really good. In all money well spent. I will come again."}
{"text":"Have to say I was a little disappointed.  From all the positive reviews, I was a bit excited to try this place out.  The brown sauce that usually comes with bo 7 mon tasted a bit different to me, a not so good different. The beef fondue was normal.  The beef salad was actually very good.  The onion wrapped in beef was bland The beef ball was not seasoned very well.  The grilled beef needed some salt.  The beef congee was better than expected.  The stir fry beef cubes were pretty good as well.   Also ordered spring rolls.  Not the best but not the worst.  Fish sauce was more salty than your average ones.  Will I come back... yes.  I need to try the pho in order to give a more accurate review.  I believe for Viet restaurants, spring rolls and pho are a must try in order to accurately judge the restaurant.  So, please stay tuned."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I eat here often and have tried many different dishes. My favourites are the spring rolls, rice dish with grilled beef, the Vermicelli and of course...The big bowls of Pho!! Amazing! The price is reasonable,  service is friendly and fast, even their take out and the place itself is very clean. Definitely my go to spot for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place only because I had brought my car to be serviced at the nearby Toyota dealership and boy, I'm impressed! Their chicken and veggie spring rolls were delicious! Crispy and full of flavour. The pho soup had a great balance of savory \"sweetness\". I just may go out of my way to come here again in the near future. Great find!"}
{"text":"Finally! There are other decent Vietnamese restaurants in Madison, but none with anything approaching good Pho. While the Pho at Viet House isn't the best I've ever had, it blows anything else in Madison out of the water. For starters, they actually start with raw beef (the way you're supposed to). The broth is flavorful and they have all the fixings. The rest of the menu is extensive and looks to be all about Vietnamese food (no Thai food thrown in as is common around here). The Bun dish I had was quite good. We will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"I get such a good vibe from this place because it has such a clean environment and the furnishings actually look nice, not tacky like other small viet restaurants. Although, it seems somewhat hidden because me and my friend had to walk a bit from orfus to try to find it. It is across from a car dealership. Once we found this restaurant, my friend and I were greeted once we walked in. The prices are what you'd expect when you compare them to other pho chains, if not slightly more cheaper (in regards to the pho soups). The waiter was nice to us. I also like the bathroom (women's) lol. They're clean and nice elegant-looking. It has a full body mirror which is handy if you want to check your outfit and the like. Overall, I enjoyed this restaurant and I will continue stopping by."}
{"text":"Viet house is commonly misunderstood. Although, there aren't many customers inside the restaurant, you will be happy to know that you were pleasantly deceived! Since there aren't many customers, the food arrives in a matter of minutes! Not to mention the friendly staff that serve you are extremely friendly and are willing to give you recommendations. The prices are also out of this world--given the portions of food that you will receive! The regular sized pho is enough to fill regular adult sized individuals, and will cost you roughly $8 after tax! With the choice of 3 toppings and having the broth of their pho, will immediately get you hooked! The other noodle and rice dishes are nothing to pass on either! Every dish served is well prepared and is well presented and even better to taste!"}
{"text":"I frequent Viet House very often, however, my most recent experiences got me pretty disappointed. The main issue I find is with consistency - the consistency on the quality of the food served and the consistency of their billing practice. The issue surrounds their rice dish, which comes with the customer's selection of two meats. In my recent visits the portion size of the meats varied greatly from two large pieces of meats to two really small pieces of meats. Sometimes the meats are not \"hot\" when served. The other problem is with how they charged me for the side soup that I have been ordering for the past couple of years at this restaurant. I usually receive my soup with the rice free of charge, even when I order take-out. However, in my recent visit a new waitress was taking my order and charged me $3.50 for a \"Noodle soup\" when I ordered two rice dishes for take-out. I find this absolutely unacceptable and the charge being outrageously high for an 80% filled soup container. As a result I decided to come on Yelp to update my review for this restaurant."}
{"text":"It is at the back of the mall with Red Lobster.  I almost give up before I drive around to the back of the mall before I see it.  The décor is not traditional Vietnamese.  It may be left from the previous restaurant with a fireplace, twinkling star on the ceiling with changing colors.  The tables are sparely located.  We order Bun Cuon - one of the best in Toronto, tightly wrapped and taste very good.  The Pho soup is clear and can taste better.  It can be better with more bones and meat for the soup.  The meat ball has its texture. The beef can have a better grade of beef.    We also order \"Bò 7 món\" the 7 courses of  beef served for 2 costs $30.  According to others, it is more pricy than the other restaurants.  It consists of: - Gi bò: a salad made with pickled carrot, pickled daikon, and celery salad with thin strips of beef in nc mm (fish sauce).  This one is very good.  It is even better than the Thai mango salad. - Bò ch ùm: Steamed ground beef patties served with prawn krupuk - The patties is average and one comments that it is a bit fishy - Bò nhúng dm: Raw slices of beef to be cooked in a vinegared fondue - This needs some preparation to have the wrap really hard to be softened in the boiling vinegar and used it to wrap the beef with lettuce, cucumber, carrot, vermicelli and on top the beef.  Whether it can be wrapped tight is up to your skill. - Bò nng m chài: Grilled ground beef wrapped in caul fat - This one tastes like the Chinese fried beef - Bò lá lt: Grilled ground beef wrapped in a Lolot leaf (very similar to a grape leaf) - I can't really taste that there is beef inside - Bò nng hành: Grilled strips of beef rolled around a piece of scallion - I eat only the beef.  To swallow a big piece of scallion takes some courage! - Cháo Bò: Beef congee -  This is a thick congee.  If it is hotter, it will be good to wrap up the Bò 7 món  Server is attentive.  When we first order, the 2 appetizers got mix up, one before it comes and the other one has to be exchanged.   If you don't like the traditional Vietnamese restaurant setting, this one you should try."}
{"text":"Lets start with the service before ordering the meal.  The waitress is exceptionally friendly.  Totally make you feel welcome, and with big smile.  She introduces the special items on the menu with detail description.  As the restaurant environment, its nice and clean, even the waitress asks me rather I feel hot or not, that she'll adjust the curtain accordingly.  Food is very authentic, its not just some random sweet and sour pork type of fake viet food.  Fresh shrimp roll, fresh pho, and delicious viet coffe.  Most important of all, the price is very reasonable, I would highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the Chicago suburbs where Vietnamese restaurants are far and few between.  The best usually exist along Argon Street on the northside.  Since coming to Madison, it has been my mission to try every Vietnamese restaurant that strikes up.  I've driven down Washington anticipating Viet House's grand opening and was able to go this weekend.  Surprisingly the restaurant was very spacious, cool and instrumental music was playing in the background.  They had quite a selection on their menu, with many traditional dishes to choose from.  One important beverage for me is da chanh (fresh squeezed limeade).  I had the wonton and meatball egg noodle soup.  I don't typically get this but my mom has it whenever we go back to Vietnam or at restaurants in the states.  I figured I'd try it.  Needless to say, it was fantastic!  However it wasn't what I thought I ordered.  Instead of meatballs, it was slices of pork.  Regardless, the soup was bursting with so much flavor!  The wontons (mostly pork) had a bit of fish flavor, but it just melted in your mouth.  My boyfriend had the staple, flank and meatball pho.  Again, it was phenomenal!  The broth had hints of several spices.  It was not only beefy but rich with sweet baking spices such as nutmeg.  To top it off, they provided us with eggrolls on the house.  I had the full experience perhaps due to the local Vietnamese friends and family (I'm assuming) that were there to embrace the warm grand opening!"}
{"text":"Really like this place! Great service and spring rolls and Bun is delicious!! Spacious and appears clean. Good place to go to after shopping at Yorkdale. Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I make sure to go here everytime I go to orfus road, the food is a great price and very fresh and flavourful as well as huge portion for the soup!  I love that they serve your soup with fresh sprigs of basil. The spring rolls are amazing and so are the milk Shakes"}
{"text":"Woot woot!  My 300th review!  If you are looking for yummy Vietnamese eats in the Yorkdale/Orfus Road area, this is your place! They have an affordable menu with great selection.  The vermicelli was delish; perfect meat to noodles ratio.  The Pho broth had depth and hit the spot.    I was surprised to find vegetarian options available which is definitely a plus.   Service was great and very attentive.  I will definitely be back when I am in the area; you should check them out as well."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff and good food.  Giving three stars because I wasn't particularly blown away with the noodle soup broth as it was a little bit oily, and not flavourful like I'm used to. Portion sizes and prices are also smaller, and more expensive compared to your typical mom and pop pho place.  One thing that I really liked about this place was the customizable dishes. So instead of searching through your typical lengthy menu of different soup combinations, their menu actually allows you to choose the types of meats you want.   This is definitely a classier version of a pho place, but with that you lose some of its authenticity.  Good but won't be coming here again unless I'm close by."}
{"text":"I took my mom there last night after our little shopping trip at Yorkdale because I was sick of eating the foodcourt food and the restaurant was litterally a two minute drive from the mall. My dear mom being Vietnamese doesn't normally like going to any Viet restaurants because I have to admit most of the time the food turned out to be very disappointing compared to my mom's cooking. She actually enjoyed her \"Hu Tieu Nam Vang\" & thought the soup was very flavourful without any taste of the MSG. My \"Com Tam Ga Nuong Bi/Grilled Chicken, Shredded Pork on Broken Rice\" was also very good. I wanted to order a plain \"Pho\" for my 3 y/o son & the co-ower suggested I go with a different order which would give me the plain Pho & the \"Suon Nuong/Grilled Pork\" on the side for the same price so I could enjoy it with my rice order. But what really impressed me was the fact that the waitor came back with our hot tea for me & my mom & a cup of water  with a straw for my little son without me asking. Same with the food, he gave us a small bowl with a small plastic spoon & a pair of scissors to cut the Pho noodles for the kid without being asked. Usually I would have to ask other restaurants for that stuff & sometimes I'd have to keep asking if they forgot to bring it which make me feel so demanding & troublesome. :) Will definitely come back to this place for the excellent food & service. Oh & there's one more plus: their washroom stalls are really spacious. I didn't have to struggle to squeeze  my son & me in there like I usually do at other Viet restaurants. :D"}
{"text":"Not bad pho. My son likes the place because they have Chinese donut stick.  And it's also a bit of a surprise and inexpensive find in the area.  Bonus: my son left his iPod and headphones there and they kept it for us until we came to get it."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here and I look forward to going back!  I had the Pho Tai (rare beef) and Spring Rolls (Cha Gio). These were by far the best Vietnamese spring rolls I have ever had. They have a wonderful flavour together with the dipping sauce.  Viet House has a very friendly staff and they were fast and efficient.  It was very quiet when I visited during the busy lunch rush in the area. I truly hope the good word spreads about this place. It deserves to prosper.  Vietnamese cuisine, IMHO, deserves to be popularized such as so many other Asian cuisines. If you haven't tried it yet, do yourself the flavour."}
{"text":"Stopped into Viet House today.  I had the Pho Tai, and the cha gio.  Egg rolls were ok, the standard fare, although they had a chinese style rice wrapper as opposed to the normal vietnamese fried spring roll wrap.    The Pho was pretty good, the flavor of the broth was great.  There wasn't much steak,   or noodles for that matter - really the bowl was kindof small to what you would expect when ordering Pho.   I guess this probably suits local tastes, as Pho is pretty unknown around Madison, and most westerners wouldn't know what to do with the standard size bowl of Pho.  Also the normal Pho condiments came with a sad little sprig of basil.   The space was WAY to large for this place. It was tastefully decorated, but just too big. Also the hostess station is at the far end of the restaurant which can lead to some confusion when walking in.    I hope this place the best, I will definitely stop in again to try the bun.  I will reserve further judgement untill I try more of the menu.  I still miss Minneapolis and Denver Pho places!"}
{"text":"The wife and I had the COSTCO hotdog and poutine for lunch...(that's another review) anyway, we needed something light to end the day.  Why not some PHO?  It's near our place and we finally took the time to try this place.  Don't be fooled because it's in a business plaza.  The interior has a modern look and comfortable.     The food is fresh!  We only had the rare beef pho and chicken fried rice but if you are able to do the simple things right on the menu, I'm sure the rest of the menu is good as well!  I recommend this place if you are in the area!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: it's new and clean.  Service is quick and friendly.  Cons: the foods not good! Like, when my pho came, the rice noodle was all stuck together.  And also, the spring.rolls were tiny and the taste was decent at best."}
{"text":"the vietnamese sub sandwich was very good and quite a value for $5.00  great flavor"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite new find for Vietnamese food. Unfortunately, yesterday's visit made me question my previous review. I'm not sure if they are under new ownership, but everything about this place has gone downhill.  Over the past 6 months, Viet House has changed the format of their menu. The Grilled pork with rice paper and vermicelli that you assemble yourself used to be my go-to dish. When they wrote the new menu, they removed this option. When I went in about 5 months ago, I asked them if the grilled pork was still available and they made it for me. The grilled pork comes as part of a mixed grill entree, so they still have it, but just as part of a different dish.  When I went in this time, I asked the waiter if I could have the pork since it used to be on the menu. He said that no, it never had been. Perhaps, he thought I was referring tthe recent, revised menu, but I told him that I had been to Viet House many times some time back and they had a pork dish on the old menu. No, he said. This may have been a language barrier, but it felt rude and dismissive. The service here has always been friendly and accommodating, so I was a little shocked at this guy's negativity.  We ordered Spring Rolls, My friend had the Lemongrass Chicken and Pork and I had the Beef with Rice Paper wraps. Bahn Trang.  When he arrived with our main courses, he shoved the spring roll plate, which my friend was still nibbling from to the other side of the table and practically threw our plates in front of us.  The food was mediocre compared to all the previous visits. My friend's dish had no apparent lemongrass flavour and the presentation left much to be desired. It all looked thrown on the plate.  I was sad. I loved this place and would come here often with my boyfriend of best friend after a Costco run. I'll think twice next time."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Vietnamese place when I'm in the area.  The noodles in anchovy soup are consistently fantastic and the curries are typically quite good (except for the last time...hopefully that doesn't become a trend).  Service was excellent every time, good decor and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I went here after some great reviews on Yelp, but there was nothing great about it- trust me. The bun here was cold, old, and bland. The pho was just plain pho. The spring rolls were old because the sides were crusty. The peanut sauce was watery.. The boba smoothie was not properly made, full of ice chunks, no flavor and not a single boba on the bottom. I ordered the Taro  smoothie, and the waitress came out with a cup full of white puke. I asked if it was a mistake and maybe she thought I said \"coconut?\" and she insisted that it was Taro. Please don't lie, taro is a purple yam, it could never come out white. I also asked for a wedge of lime for the water since the boba smoothie tasted and looked like garbage, and the waitress came out with a string of lime. I thought places like this only existed on T.V with Chef Ramsey, but turns out there's one in Madison, WI. Save yourself from eating garbage and eat at Saigon instead if you are looking for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a large group for lunch. Everyone at our table got food at the same/similar time except for one friend. By the time they came out with her order which was much later, the rest of us were done eating already. I ordered the bun (vermicelli) with spring roll and shrimp wrapped bean curd. It was ok, not that flavourful, and the noodles were thick. Also ordered viet coffee at the beginning and it didnt come until long after we were done our meal. Had to end up taking it to go because everyone started leaving already. On a positive note, the owner seemed really nice! And the ingredients seemed fresh (especially the bean sprouts)"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Both of the appetizers we got were very flavorful. I've never had deep-fried tofu that was so great in a while. The vegetarian egg roll was a little oily but still was good. The main course were amazing with HUGE , flavorful portions. Price was right. Service was spot-on. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Good food ! Fast service ! I will come back for sure . Beef and  brócolis was tasteful !"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here with my family everytime we've craved pho for over a year now. My usual order is the pho with grilled chicken on the side. It's delicious and fairly priced for everything you're getting. The staff are friendly and they remember us everytime we come in. It's typically never busy so service is fast."}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant so many times and always wanted to try it, after reading the good reviews here. So I came here with a friend on Friday.  As we walked in we were greeted by the friendly server. The place is clean and tidy. It even has a performance stage with floor screens and a piano on it! But to my surprise the restaurant was not air-conditioned during our visit (they left the windows open and had the fan on though), which made it a bit muggy inside before a rainfall that was going to pour down.  As a result I decided to order shrimp pad thai instead of pho. The order came quick and it was really delicious. The sauce was great. My friend, however, ordered crispy noodles with beef and veggie and it was truly a disappointment. Neither of us knew what crispy noodles was like. So when the food came, I was surprised as the noodles on the plate looked and tasted like some sort of snack noodles I used to eat. My friend finished everything else except for the noodles, as he really was not into them. I guess the lesson is to stick to what you know.  Also, when we came in, the tables were all empty with no tableware or napkin boxes like in other pho joints. The server quickly brought them to us but still.. we had to ask for something each time which was a bit of inconvenience.   Overall, I enjoyed my food but was a little disappointed with my experience here. I would bring my friend here again if possible, as I did get some positive vibes despite some gripes. Hope my visit is better next time!"}
{"text":"So yummy ! No complaints with what I ordered. I didn't get the bo 7 mon but similar to it with the variety grilled meats along with the shrimp salad.  I think they're known for the bo 7 mon so no disappointment. I'd come back if I lived in town."}
{"text":"Decided to try another Vietnamese restaurant's mango shrimp salad with pho, and for the price of this, there definitely wasnt enough shrimps or mangos. The tamarind sauce tasted good. But the shrimps were peeled in halfs and scattered sparingly on top of a lack of mango slices.  They would get 2 stars if not for the super nice service."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good.  The restaurant is big and can seat a lot of people.  They have domestic beer for about $4/bottle.  Vermicelli $8.50 - The meat is tender, the noodles are nicely cooked and it comes with an egg roll.  Special Fried Rice $11.50 - Good flavor, comes with shrimp, imitation crab, carrots, peas and egg.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"The restaurant was larger than expected.  The service was quick and friendly.  The pho you can choose up to 3 items and the rice and vermicelli you can choose up to 2 items."}
{"text":"Take out experience only: The Pad Thai (requested extra spicy) was awesome. Quite surprised as this is a Vietnamese restaurant. $11 and change. Noodles were done just right and generous amount of beef. Crushed peanuts and extra hot sauce supplied on side with lemon wedge. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place really impressed me. The first thing that struck me was the look of the place. It was clean and actually had some decor, not like a downtown Asian restaurant. It does have kind of a lounge vibe, but I don't see how that's a problem. It's a refreshing change from plastic chairs and unswept floors in other parts of the city.   My server was great. She was friendly and polite in a way I haven't experienced in Toronto, let alone in a small Vietnamese restaurant on a side street. She welcomed me, made conversation, checked in to see how the food was. She did ask me if I was ok with chopsticks which I almost thought was offensive but then when she took the utensils to the table of Asian folks next door she asked them the same thing. Turns out she was offering a fork so that everyone is comfortable. Nice. I ordered the spring rolls for about $4 and a regular pho for $6.95. The menu lets you choose three meats for the pho. I went with rare beef, flank, and on a whim, chicken. The serving size for the soup was big. Lots of meat, allowing several bites of each type which was also impressive compared to the competition. The broth was a sodium bomb, but I like it that way so not a problem. The springs rolls were my second favorite ever. Crispy, chickeny, mildly greasy, would make for good hangover food. Tea was free.   It's just up the road from work, I'll be going back."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Less than a year after they opened, Viet House has closed, with no notice about where or when they might reopen.  Another mom and pop ethnic restaurant bites the dust.  I remember the nice Latino male waiter with a friendly smile.  ***  Viet House just opened within a week of this review being written.  One day, a banner read \"coming soon\" and the next day, it said \"grand opening\".  We ordered the nem nuong noodles (bun) and lemongrass beef noodles (bun). our dining companions ordered the wonton noodle soup and the traditional com (rice) dish with Vietnamese meatloaf and shrimp on a sugarcane.   Having eaten at the other three main Vietnamese restaurants in Madison, I would say that Viet House has a lot of potential to compete.  They have nice decor, friendly waitstaff, and a nice selection of smoothies and boba tea for the average price in town ($4 or under).   I'll write another review on my next excursion here."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Sunday night for a quick dinner.  We ordered the egg rolls as an appetizer and each ordered Pho.  The Pho was quite good - my only complaint was the sodium factor.  I was parched for the rest of the night.  They serve the broth and meat and place fresh bean sprouts, peppers, and basil on the table for you to add as you like.  The veggies were fresh and the Pho was good.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved from L.A. and this place was near my apartment so I decided to try their pho. I had their #33 Viet House Deluxe - Large combo with rare & well eye round steak, soft tendon, tripe and beef meatball.   Overall, pretty good. Could've been more generous with the noodles, but the broth itself was tasty. I expected more meat considering it was the \"deluxe.\" It;s the first pho I've had since moving to Madison so there's not much to compare to from the area.   Definitely will come here again to try their banh mi though."}
{"text":"Average viet food IMO but the portion is probably the smallest quantity I have ever seen in a viet place cuz I had rice dish and I was still left hungry afterwards.  I'm NOT a big eater by any means and lack of quantities at a viet joint is little disappointing.  Pho was also average and tasted very generic, again lacking quantity. The place is very big and seems like people rent out the place to host private events. Blah!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere and excellent service. Dishes are very affordable and tasty. Very spacious and can accommodate large groups of people."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's usually pretty empty when I go there which is a shame. It's well priced (cheaper than downtown). The service is fast and friendly and the food is great. I'm certainly glad that I've found this spot to take care of my pho addiction!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed, went by here on 4/26 and the sign is down and it was all dark inside. Never got to try it."}
{"text":"Don't post your HOURS until 10 pm and send customers away at 925.. Never return. Weak."}
{"text":"Most Asian food I have in Madison just makes me miss the food in LA.  And sadly, the pho at Viet House is no different.    The pho at  Viet House is better than Saigon Noodles or any other Vietnamese place I've been to in town, but I felt that the broth could've been more flavorful, the amount of rice noodles could've been more generous.  However, their bahn mi is delicious.  I had the grilled pork bahn mi and it was exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Their grilled pork bahn mi's didn't include any pate, but I usually ask for them to leave it out anyway.  I've also had their spring rolls, which typically are non-fried, wrapped with rice paper.  I found them to just be average.    The egg rolls are fried, but they were a disappointment.  They should've came with lettuce and basil and herbs to wrap the egg rolls with but instead all we got were just the egg rolls on a plate with some pickled carrots as garnish.   I've been there three times now, and twice my meal was ruined by the waitress.  It was the same waitress who was surprisingly incompetent both times.  We had asked her specifically whether the egg rolls came with lettuce and she said yes.  Then when it came without any lettuce, we asked for some and she seemed confused by the request.  Also, both times in the middle of me taking a bite of my food and enjoying my meal, she stops by and asks whether I am finished.  It ruins my meal every time.  I rather no service than incompetent service.  Come here anyway.  Just get the bahn mi to go."}
{"text":"I don't think i've ever seen a bad Vietnamese restaurant.  Great selection, tasty dishes. As I usually get on my first visit to a Vietnamese restaurant, I ordered the grilled pork and chicken on fried rice.  The cuts were good. The dishes were remarkably inexpensive.  It could be the best overall restaurant in the area, and I'll include Yorkdale in that area... :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my coworkers today and was quite surprised how empty the restaurant was. The food is decent and the prices are great compared to other similar spots in the area.   I had the vermicelli bowl with spicy lemongrass chicken (not really spicy, though) and a spring roll. Was just over $10 including tax and tip. Very reasonable. Would definitely return to try the Pho, as it looked really good!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Environment: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Family friendly: 4/5  A nice little hidden gem in a business plaza which you may miss if you drive pass Dufferin. Came here after shopping at Yorkdale after search on Yelp. Food is nice and price very reasonable. I like their vermicelli \"bún\" which they put mint in it, it is very refreshing. Also, you can choose 2 items like spring roll, grilled pork or grilled chicken etc in it so you can mix and match which I haven't seen at other place.  A good place for lunch or dinner if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that there is a good place like this and never heard of it before till my friend found it. I had \" Hu tieu My Tho\" for the dinner. The dish itself is pretty authentic - said by a Vietnamese, lol. They used clear noodle but not small vermicelli as usual which makes the dish more chewy with full flavor. The sauce is made from garlic oil plus soy sauce, little vinegar and sugar. Main meat from the dish is seafood.   My friend had 2 choices of meat noodle. That's their special for the night, I think. He picked chicken with beef stir-fried with green and red bell pepper, onion with some dry crush peanut on the top. \"So tasty!\" that's all he said when he tried first piece and then just focused on the food.  The place has A/C, fancy look with nice and friendly servers. They are really helpful. Not like other vietnamese food place, they kept checking up on customers if they need something and filling the water - Which I rarely see anyplace does that. I will come back here and try other yummy dishes!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, delightful young waitress.   Many new things to try and explore.  Finally, a nice tender lemon grass beef.  Grand Opening special is 4 free egg rolls with the purchase of 2 entrees."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a pretty large restaurant in comparison to the other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.   Definitely roomy enough for hosting an event.   Perks:  Large dining area Grand piano on a platform TV's Plenty of free Parking Good size menu Lots of natural light Modern and simple decor Clean Modern tea set (which I would like to purchase ;)  Improvements:  It needs more advertising so that people know they exist. Slightly hidden near Orfus Rd/Yorkdale.   Friendly and the food was good.   Music was classic 80's!!!! Loved it!   Bon appetit!!!"}
{"text":"I just happened to be working nearby this place one day so being the noodle soup lover that I am, I decided to pop in and check it out.    The restaurant is situated in a sleepy strip mall consisting of office/retail units and this restaurant was rather large.  It felt more like a night club/Asian karaoke bar than a Vietnamese restaurant.  As my visit was on a Friday afternoon, most of the tables sat empty.    I ordered my safe brisket beef noodle soup (s) and my hubby ordered ginger beef (s) Pho.  The bowls arrived without much warmth to the soup which was a deal breaker right off the bat.  To add insult to injury, the waiter came by a few minutes after our noodle soups arrived, only to take away our Sriracha and hoisin sauce bottles to another table.    Broth was the usual msg + stock blend and there wasn't much to be said about other flavours in the soup.  But my hubby really disliked his ginger beef pho as the meat was very chewy and tough on top of being wayyyyyy too gingery.  It was hard to taste anything other than ginger in his soup.    Next time I'm in the area, I'll just skip this place and head down south on Dufferin to grab myself a good ol' California sandwich instead."}
{"text":"Not flavorful.  Watered-down.  Less grilled meat/meat on soup.  The grilled meats looked like leftovers and slightly microwaved!  XL $8.95.  I had to add tons of the brown sauce and hot sauce to give it some taste; normally, not needed.  1/2 star is more appropriate.  Regret having lunch here."}
{"text":"Really good food. Delicious   Service was good, interesting Vietnamese cooking show playing. Large interesting space.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"pretty bomb soup overall, taste is up there with some of the greats. Spacious and homey, i recommend this for lunch or dinner dates, food doesn't disappoint. Also you cannot beat the price, actually well worth the money!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim on our way out of town back Minneapolis. It's in a sad strip mall but don't let that stop you. The decor is peaceful and nice compared to most vietnamese restaurants. And the food was wonderful.  Not my parent's home cooking but among us we had the rice with pork chop (com tam bi suong), pho tai and vietnamese crepes with shrimp and pork, greens and bean sprouts (banh xeo) and everything was delicious! Most times restaurants skimp on the ingredients and garnishing for bahn xeo but not here. And the service was GREAT!   We'll seek this place out again when in Madison."}
{"text":"Great place customer service is great very clean will come here anytime would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a large plaza near Dufferin St & Lawrence Ave W. If you've been in this area before, driving during the day is usually a nightmare because narrow lanes and usually construction makes a bad driving experience. However, once you get to the plaza, there are tons of parking spaces. The restaurant itself is very spacious and looks nice and clean. My companion and I were immediately greeted at the door and seated quickly. Unlike other Pho restaurants, I noticed there weren't the typical oyster and Srichacha sauce and tons of utensils at each table. The server actually brings out your utensils with your meals!   We ordered a large size spring rolls, Assorted meat Regular size pho, and Vermicelli with lemongrass chicken and marinated pork. The spring rolls tasted fresh to order, the roll itself was light and fried well, and the inside was tasty. The pho broth was decent, albeit not much depth of beef flavour but not as bad as some other places where it's either too salty or you can definitely taste the msg flavour. The vermicelli was also decent, with thinner and shorter noodles (which I'm okay with but my companion didn't like) and well cooked meat. I could have used more pickled vegetables and fresh bean sprouts and cucumber but overall it was good. Portion size, both the pho and vermicelli dishes were huge for the price. I think the regular size pho was $6.39 and the vermicelli was $7.39 with two choices of meats.   Great value for Vietnamese food with big portions and good service! I'd definitely come back to taste some other dishes or for my 2nd go-to pho place."}
{"text":"I tried out Viet House on a Tuesday afternoon because it was so close to work.  Walking in around noon, there were 2 tables seated and a server + the boss in the restaurant. I was seated, placed my order, and then served.  The waitress was so sweet.  I had a really long day and came in a little sleepy and didn't understand some items and she took the time to go over the menu with me + plus one star.  My assorted pho came out pretty quick and at first taste it was not bad at all.  However, even though the prices are cheaper than most ($6.95 for a Regular [medium]) there wasn't a whole lot in the bowl.  The noodles were a handful if even, the assorted meats came out to several beef, several tendon, and several tripe.  The tripe tasted stale and even though it's my favourite part of pho .. I had to leave it }:  There's nothing \"wow\" about this place esp since I'm still a little hungry going back to work }:"}
{"text":"This vietnamese restaurant has good soups and close to yorkdale mall, major highways like 401, Allan road. They have lots of parking in front of the restaurant, take out, delivery are also available. Price is decent and food quality is good. The restaurant is relatively small but clean."}
{"text":"Finally Pho East of Madison!!!  I went here for dinner last night.  My first reaction was to walk out because there was only 1 occupied table in the large restaurant but I'm very happy we stayed.  We started with the Spring Rolls which were super fresh and tasty. Although the peanut sauce was a little watery....they were still very good.  Then we each had Pho and I have to say they do a fabulous Pho.  I think they put a little lemongrass in it which is always welcome. We also decided to split the Pork with Lemongrass, again very fresh and very tasty.  To top it off I thought the waitress was a delight, maybe not a seasoned waitress but  a pleasure nonetheless.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My usual work lunch spot. Good food, large menu, and reasonable prices. Very quick service. I recommend the vermicelli búns and rice dishes."}
{"text":"Not flavourful, a bit bland, and watered down. However, it's pretty cheap and they have a lot of variety. The portion is decent, wasn't too much. Could use a bit more toppings. The owner(s) are very friendly.  I would go there again, but I don't live near ahha :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The place just opened and my husband and I went to check it out. The place was empty and still we had to wait and wait for service. The waitress was rude. The food was bad. Pho has too much nutmeg or something. Saigon Noodle is much better."}
{"text":"Really yummy and great prices. Definitely recommend! Make your own wrap dish is huge. Pho is also good. Service is also nice."}
{"text":"Am I ever going to find eye-rolling, lip-smacking good Bun or Pho in Madison?? Pho-get about it! Will I be happy that I can get decent, A-OK Vietnamese food? Yes, i will be happy.  A new place on the east side. A few kinks to work out (timing of dishes appearing at the table) but decent stuff. The crepe came out nicely, the pho broth was well-anised, a bit darker than I might expect but decent stuff. The Bun with grilled pork missed the mark. The pork was cold as if it had been grilled in advance. I'll happily wait for fresh grilled pork.   A second visit is warranted but for now, A-OK will make me happy."}
