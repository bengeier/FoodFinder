{"text":"You can't find a better weekend brunch than Bergie's! My family really enjoyed the atmosphere, attentive and friendly staff, and amazing food. Bergie's Benedict especially hit the spot for me (they had me at charred scallion cream cheese), while my husband and daughter enjoyed the light and fluffy pancakes. The staff was happy to accommodate two requests for substitutions. I highly recommend Bergie's as a more refined food option in Monticello!"}
