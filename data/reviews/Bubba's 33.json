{"text":"First time here! Our service was great and the food outstanding. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Eh, nothing out of the ordinary.  This is a sister property to Texas Road House.  We made an impromptu first visit around 5:30pm on a Friday.  I was lucky to spot a table in the Garage (bar) area and scooped it up.  Loud as hell in there when packed!  We both had the $4 Long islands which were mediocre.  Our waitress was spunky,  very informative.  She answered all our questions and was very pleasant.  We redeemed the free app coupon for the white queso which I loved!  We each ordered pizzas and hubby was taken by surprise by the garlic-herb butter basted crust edge,  it was a little too strong for him.  I liked the smoked tomato very much on my Margherita with sausage which I ordered to take home later.  I also ordered the fish and chips, not bad.  Lastly, Hubby had wings too which were good size but not crispy enough.  I'm in no hurry to go back but we'll be getting a gift certificate for my father in law to try since he's a Texas roadhouse fan.  We'll suggest to sit in the restaurant area."}
{"text":"Well this places popped out of nowhere 1st impressions  As soon as you walk in the door super  Friendly you sat in the bar because the restaurant closes at 10 But this my  Might be our new Sunday spot since B j's is game super expensive and their portions are getting really small no good so we ordered garlic knots which were probly the best I ever had love the cheese sauce that came with Ordered 6 wings those were not very good little slimy rubbery probingly be cooked a lot longer didn't care for the sauce also had a veggie pizza that was a good next time won't get the smoked tomato but I did love the crust I had their Habanero Burger which was really good juicy not cheese spicy but the deep fried cream cheese made the Burger Are several is nice she was on top every thing never needed to ask for anything good explaining the  Menu over all great   Experience They pry have the best prices in arrowhead We will be back very soon"}
{"text":"I missed opening day, however I have had the opportunity now to get in and give it a try.  We were sat shockingly fast, the cleanup crew is RIDICULOUSLY FAST!  Literally as soon as you turn from your table the buss personnel descend like buzzards to road kill!  They get it ready for the next customers in such a time that it would make a Nascar pit crew envious!  I ordered the Philly pizza and my wife a standard burger, we were both very happy with the taste of our meals and the onion rings were phenomenal!!!  The only reason I didnt give it the 5th star was once we were seated our waitress was not attentive to our needs as we would have liked.  I finished my drink near the beginning of my meal and was never asked if I would like another until we were finished our meal....so my wife let me sip on hers.  We will go back and hopefully it was just our server and the entire wait staff that is like this, by the reviews I tend to believe mine may have been an isolated incident.  A tip that I would like to offer is that if there is more than one person dining...order the large rings, so you don't have to fight over them!"}
{"text":"Decent menu choices and the place can hold a pretty good amount of people. The food was better than expected for bar food. Tried the garlic knots, which were tasty and a rather large appetizer. Also had the buffalo chicken sandwich - huge, but just okay tasting - diff than normal buffalo flavor. Had a burger and the Nacho Mama's pizza - both good.   Didn't give 5 stars because the head on our beer was nearly an inch and when I walked out to get my family, two staff members were standing in front of each door like they were there to hold it for people, but didn't really make a move to open one. Kind of awkward.   Giving them a pass because they were not even open a week. Will revisit."}
{"text":"HOW DOES A BAR HAVE FOOD THIS GOOD???   TLDR; great seafood (I know!) and service, Go here. You'll be happy you did.   My husband and I came to Bubba's before Deadpool 2 and man, we are in LOVE.   Not only is it SUPER cool to see every single employee with a smile on their face and loving work, but the food was delicious.   My husband got an Italian sausage pizza and I got the chicken tenders and shrimp with fries and coleslaw. OH MY GOD. I think they hand breaded everything on my plate. This is better shrimp than a seafood restaurant. The pizza was also delicious. But, after those heavenly chicken tenders and shrimp I don't I could order anything else.   We can't wait to come back. So happy there's something near the theater that's so good!"}
{"text":"As far as the food this place is a 5+ for me but the service is lacking.  My wife and I have been three times.  The first time the wings and black bean burger were great.  The waitress forgot the appetizer and when I asked about it she just walked off.  I was waiting for the bill and then she brings the fiesta dip that should have been brought in the beginning.  I would not order this item.  It was bad.  We ended up paying for it.  The second time was great all the way around other than the wait time for the food is a little long.  Jill was fantastic.  We ordered a chicken and steak dish.  Both were melt in your mouth good.  The third time it was another service issue.  We were seated, they took our drink order and we were told someone else would be our waitress.  She never arrived.  After 15 minutes we told one of the managers the issue.  She took our order and about 20 minutes later our two burgers came out without our appetizer again.  When our waitress finally came to the table we told her not to bother bringing it as I wasn't going to pay for it this time.  For some reason they have an issue with bringing out appetizers before the meal.  If the service was better they would get 5 stars.  We may be back or may not.  It's very pricy for their lack of service."}
{"text":"I've been to Bubbas33 several times now. My new favorite!! Food is great.  Atmosphere is fun and high energy.  All servers help each other out with food running,  clearing tables,  refilling drinks.  Ask for server Jean. She's is on point every time!!! Also if your order comes out wrong, don't take out out on your server with reducing their tip!!!!   Your order will be fixed and then enjoy it and be happy!!!! Love it there!"}
{"text":"Great place - can't wait to go back. Onion rings are homemade and taste great!  The staff were friendly and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing!! I got a margarita and it was bomb. Awesome vibe and great service. Our waiter was James and he did a phenomenal job. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  From the service, to drinks, to food, to dessert!  Definitely found a new spot.  The glazed bacon appetizer!!  Stop!  Highly recommend this place.  We found a new go to!  Nice to meet everyone and we look very forward to seeing you again.  Thanks for a great meal and hospitality."}
{"text":"Mark is the BEST bartender in the joint, hands down..love the guy. This is why people come back. Stellar service and food. The whole experience was that great..mostly because of Mark. Good job Bubba's."}
{"text":"1st experience at bubba33.great food and atmosphere our waitress outstanding no long wait times i definantley will be coming back in the future"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  The only thing wrong is everything is so good you leave really full!!!!  Burgers and Pizza are 5 Star and I'm real picky about my food."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. I had spicy chicken sandwich and fire fries and it was a good heat. Very tasty and hot. Very accommodating even though we arrived 45 minutes before closing. Definitely a bar atmosphere with sports channels and good music."}
{"text":"Took my 5 yr old here on the grand opening day... we were looking for something new and different and this definitely fit the bill. He had a burger and I had a steak, both were BOMB!!! Staff was super friendly and catered to our needs. Hope it stays this way!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Appetizer were great. Lunch was better than I would have expected. The place was very comfortable. I am a big guy and don't like most booths. These were roomy. Service was great. I have nothing to say negatively about it. Except, I don't want it to become so popular that it is crowded all of the time. Because it is that good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place is awesome!!  Our server Chris T. was quite witty!!!  Great food. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and the food was amazing! I highly recommend trying the lemonade."}
{"text":"We tried Bubba's 33 last night and enjoyed our food very much. My husband had pizza and I had burger and fries. Both dishes exceeded our expectations. The service was excellent. The atmosphere was nicely done, even with many TVs we could still easily hold a conversation. The beer was cold! What more could we ask for? Great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time Friday for happy hour and will definitely be back! Great atmosphere and the bartender Jana was fantastic! She was super friendly and had great suggestions and opinions of the food. Went about 4 pm and easily got a few seats at the bar. By the time we left at 540 pm, the place was pretty full in both the bar and restaurant. Got the bacon appetizer, chicken nachos, and a burger. Prob one of the best burgers My friend has ever had!!!! Food came out timely, Sangria was perfect!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here this evyso we could have a good time, boy did we. Their long island ice tea's are so good it is dangerous. Too many of those and it's a major party. The onion rings are perfectly fried and the bubba sauce is yummy. I had the Monday madness special which is a burger with 3 toppings for $6.99 and that's a slamming deal. We will definitely be coming back for more. The staff was friendly and loved talking to you about your meal or what game was on the TV's.  Bravo on a good staff. Our server Courtney was the best, ask for her and she will treat you good."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The staff is so friendly. They have a great selection of foods. I'm not a drinker but the drinks they offer look and sound so yummy. Several people were enjoying them. They offer mostly indoor but also have several outdoor tables. There is a corn-hole set for customers to play outside if they want to have a little additional fun. This place is so wonderful we went twice during their opening weekend and, will definitely be back! Oh and don't forget to sign up for the MVP club! We already have 2 free items on our next visit(s)!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place with a ton of tv's. Came with a small group and our waiter handled the orders etc without issue.  The spicy chicken sandwich was tasty and appeared to be hand battered vs from frozen. Wasn't really spicy, but it had good flavor.  Tried their fire fries, but I swear I got regular fries as they didn't have any heat to them. A couple of people had the individual pizzas which they enjoyed minus the one person whose pizza came out with the wrong toppings. They quickly made him a new one so no harm."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner! Burgers were awesome!! When a restaurant first opens, you generally expect to have \"so so\" service, that was not the case! Very friendly, fun atmosphere! We will definitely be back! Excited to have a cool new place in the area!"}
{"text":"Fun and family friendly,  tons of TV's, good music and friendly staff.. did I mention wall to wall TV's? Huge bar area, tons of seating and lots of chatter with everyone smiling. We started with drinks, I ordered a peach coda... Amazing!!! Burger with onion rings... awesome! Lots on the menu from pizzas to sandwiches to salads ... most your favorite standby dishes  and a few with a twist of something new!  Definitely a local favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was very good and they are very friendly.  The Garlic knots are AMAZING!! They have a lot of different choices on their menu and some items that are out of the norm (Bacon for an appetizer!!).  I can't wait to go back and try the Pizza.  They have lots of TVs on the walls and a clean and inviting environment."}
{"text":"Great little find. Food and drinks always good, service needs improvement in the bar seating area. Second time here and service is still lacking. Hopefully it will get better. Have to ask for server, got appetizers with no cutlery, napkins or plates. Never got water, still waiting for server to order another drink. Will be back and hopefully services will be better."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and the food is yum! Their onion rings are the BEST.  I love all the TV's showing different games and stuff. Loud atmosphere but not too loud. My kids love it. Their burgers are so yum - thick and juicy!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, great atmosphere.  We came here for dinner and walked into a crowded restaurant expecting to wait to be seated and wait to be served and that was NOT the case... they were perfectly staffed to accommodate the crowd.    We started with the wings and ordered the shotgun sauce... in my husbands words... \"it was phenomenal.\" It's almost like a sweet and sour with a bit of heat - really good!  My husband had the 33 Bacon burger and he said it was a well made burger.  He got loaded fries with it and they were delish!  The queso on them was just the right touch.    I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and I thought the chicken was breaded perfectly, just the right amount of sauce and yummy ranch dressing to top my sandwich.  I ordered the side salad instead of the fries and was happy with my choice as their side salad came with eggs and potato strings, giving it a nice crunch.  The salad was also topped with their ranch which I really enjoyed.  Definitely will be going back again!"}
{"text":"I hate chains.  I LOVE BUBBA's.  Although I feel weird making that comment, it is true. The burger's are delicious.  The fries are wonderful.  Everyone in my party loved their food.    I will be going back this week. I really like it here."}
{"text":"I am becoming a regular at your establishment.  Good food and military discounts.  Never heard of it before but i am glad you opened up here.  Danae is a great server she is real sweetheart.  If you want to enjoy your visit ask for her.  Always has a beautiful smile.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in today with my wife to check you guys out.  The wings were great..our beer was cold..but our server Carli was amazing.  She greeted us with a smile as soon as we sat down.  My wife is a picky eater but she answered her endless questions about the menu and her smile never left her face. She  treated us like family  A true gem.  In a world of just ok service she shines like a star.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We met friends for dinner and cocktails tonight and had absolutely the best onion rings and burgers. The service was excellent and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Nothing spectacular. Mediocre burgers, frozen fries, sub-par wings....just ok. This was our first visit and unfortunately we won't be back. The good food will bring me in (and this place was not all that great) and the great service will keep me coming back, but because this place offered neither, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place!! We went for Father's Day and had a great time.  If I could write a review about the fire fries alone, I would. They're so delicious! Smoky and a nice heat. If you like spicy chicken sandwiches, I would absolutely recommend the hot and spicy sandwich, it's got such good flavor and a decent heat for spice lovers.   Long Island iced teas were so tasty!   We ordered wings to start and even though there was a benign mix up with the flavors, it was corrected and they were all delicious. Crispy and flavorful.  Haley was our server and incredibly attentive and kind. Had lots of insight to our orders and checked on us often.   I'll be back for a 5 Star review when my husband orders a complete meal (he just had salad and wings this time) but overall we will absolutely return."}
{"text":"First time visit and I was not disappointed. Ordered and sat at the bar. The bartenders were helpful and friendly and attentive. Granted it was a Tuesday but it was nice to have great service. Ordered the chicken finger platter. It came out piping hot and fresh. The tenders were lightly dusted and crispy. Not heavy batter if you know what I mean. They were delicious, tasty and very tender. Pun intended. Cold beer and hot n fresh food. What more could you ask for. I'll be back Bubba....save my seat."}
{"text":"From the bright and open entrance, any sport you would want to see on the TVs, extremely friendly staff and my burger was cooked to Perfection at an amazing price.  It's enjoyable to walk into a place for the staff make you feel welcome and wanted. We will be back"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here and the food was good! I was very impressed by how nice and friendly the staff was. I waitress was top Notch thank you Jill!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a new restaurant.  We liked Bubba's 33 so much we went twice in the last two days.      We did not have a wait during either visit.  They have a call ahead list system of you want to get in the queue before heading there.  Becca was our server the first visit.  She explained about the scratch kitchen and that they are owned by Texas Roadhouse.     The menu is a variety.. it ranges from typical sports bar and grill fare like burgers and pizza to entrees like lasagna and salmon.     Typical bar and grill fare is an understatement.   The burgers are juicy and cooked medium well.  The patties are hefty.  One in our group ordered a double patty and there's no way he could finish it.  The buns are soft and fit the patty nicely.  The pizza is delicious.  Their dough and sauce is amazing.  The lasagna is a huge portion and good enough to stand up to any Italian restaurant's and better than many we've had.     The cocktails are done just right.     Wait staff is very attentive in checking to make sure everything is okay and refilling drinks.    We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a fun night with great food, conservative prices, and excellent service. We love our servers Gillian, Chris, and Jean!! They treat us like we are guests at their home with perfect hospitality. The lasagna and the philly cheesesteak (Chicago style) our 2 of our favorites. Our new favorite place to go!!"}
{"text":"We came back to Bubba's tonight and the service was much better! We also had the pizza and the bacon avocado sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good and the pizza was definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Delicious even down to the lemonade! Wasn't excepting bar food but if that's what you like, Bubba's 33 is the food for you! Highly recommend the blackberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Hubby had the fish and chips.  I has the smoked turkey and bacon sandwich. The smoked turkey had a nice smokey flavor. The portions were huge. We were here on a late afternoon on Saturday and the place was busy, but no waiting. They has fried pickles too. We are definitely coming back. We still need to try their burgers and pizza."}
{"text":"From the clean parking lot into the pleasant entry we were drawn into the establishment and greeted by smiling employees!  We were seated quickly and offered drinks of our voice, then our waitress came to introduce herself and answer any questions we had.  Anna...delightful, energetic and thorough!  She DID inform us that the servings would be generous, and that is true!  We could have easily shared an item and been happy!  My butterflies shrimp were a little \"too\" crisp for my liking, but taste-wise they were fine.  The onion rings and French fries were very good, and the burgers the others ordered were HUGE and got great reviews.  There was no room for desserts, but they did look tempting!  I was happy to be served Coca Cola product, and my companions enjoyed their LARGE beers, selected from a nice variety of offerings!"}
{"text":"James was the best!!!! He has a great attitude and makes the atmosphere very welcoming..."}
{"text":"Have not been on this side of town in many months and found Bubba's while looking for a place to eat. Originally went to another restaurant nearby but it was overly crowded and there was a wait. Thank god for that because that caused us to find Bubba's. It's a very cool place with awesome music and televisions that panoramically surround the room. The hostess sat us right away and our server was James. He asked us if it was our first time and told us what they had to offer. He was very attentive and didn't get annoyed when we asked if we could also put in a to go order even though it was close to closing time. We had the Chicken Nachos, it had chorizo and jalapeños on it with lots of cheese. Delicious. Also had a small pizza with goat cheese, arugula and balsamic vinegar which gave it a sweetness which went very well with the goat cheese. It was also supposed to have peppers on it but we chose to opt out on that. We never felt rushed and James made sure we were taken care of. They had a good selection of pizzas and burgers. I would definitely go back, even if just for the service. Great job!"}
{"text":"Great staff, good food. Our only problem was the burgers. We got our burgers and were told that they were medium well. For a comparison I usually like to get my burgers medium rare. Our burgers were still alive when they got to the table. Literally pink!. But the service was perfect.   Update: ok we gave it a second chance. It must have been the cook on shift that didn't know how to cook a burger. Just be on the safe side and ask for it well . We did both this time and they were both good. We also got the chicken nachos... yum! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and affordable. Great pizza and better wings then the Moon Saloon"}
{"text":"Such good food and atmosphere. Side salads are different and delicious. Chorizo queso do and buffalo chicken sandwich we're super tasty as well. Definitely recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, good prices. Best onion rings I have ever had. I had shrimp po boy and spicy chicken sandwich on 2 different occasions."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Mackenzie! She knew the menu so well, and brought some sweet cocktails to us. Sweet server! Great food! loved the drinks yum yum yum!  Love the crispy fried pickles were fabulous."}
{"text":"The food here is great!! The atmosphere is very sports oriented and I love it!! The burgers have great portions and flavor. The pizza is excellent quality. The mixed drinks and beer options are great."}
{"text":"I had a side salad and smoked chipotle wings...wings were spicier than i thought they would be...4 filled me up..friendly staff and nice atmosphere..i would like to try a burger next time...hopefully i can get it protein style"}
{"text":"If youre looking for great sandwiches/bar type food....this is the place to go in this neighborhood. I've been twice and each time the food has been great!! I've tried the habanero burger, shrimp po boy, the philly cheese steak, the buffalo chicken sandwich, meat stromboli, fire fries and pizza!! All of it has been really good! The bread they use on there sandwiches is yummo. They have great pizza sauce as well. I'll be eating here often."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Same owner as Texas Roadhouse apparently. Its kinda hard to get seating out in the open seating area, but that probably just means that they are doing something right. Highly recommend the bacon appetizer. Possibly the best bacon Ive ever had. It has some sort of sweet glaze over it and then apparently injected with crack, as I cannot get enough!"}
{"text":"We have the chorizo queso dip nice and warm and yummy. Had the shrimp po boy for lunch along with loaded tater tots.  One of the best shrimp po boys I've had an Arizona! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will definitely be back. The onion rings were huge and awesome! The bacon burger was juicy and super flavorful. The fries were the perfect crispness. Good selection of beers on tap. Lots of TVs for sports enthusiasts. Jill was our server and she was friendly, prompt, and helpful. All around a wonderful experience for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Top notch service and legendary food. Great atmosphere for sports games and endless amount of tvs,not one bad seat in the house. I had the sunshine burger and it was juicy and filling, not to mention the fries dipped in their bubbas sauce. This sauce can be put on anything if you ask me. Cant wait for football and ill be back to have my fantasy football party too."}
{"text":"Have you ever had crispy juicy flavorful onion rings??? Yeah me either until I came here.  Best onion rings I have ever had...EVER! I ordered my kids a pepperoni pizza it was so good and tasted so authentic! I got a bacon burger it was cooked PERFECT!! no pink just how i like but super juicy and a lot of flavor. My husband got the Fish and chip and they were so good! We literally passed our food around for each of us to try and everything was good. I never thought I would say this but.. their boneless wing are better then the traditional lol GREAT SERVICE! EXCELLENT FOOD! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great place, environment and great service to go with it. Everything I have tried here on 4 visits has been awesome."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour ! Loved the drinks but the wings were rather plain and our service wasn't fantastic but I would definitely go again !"}
{"text":"As soon as you enter the decor totally gets you and you already feel at home. There are people holding doors for you and hostesses ready there to seat you. The furniture is super retro and modern at the same time it's very appealing. The bar has hooks for purses and charging stations every so feet. Jean and Eric from this location are so comforting and entertaining to be around! They're very attentive and great at conversations! They make you feel like a friend rather than a customer :) Amazing food and flavorful drinks! Definitely recommend for anyone who wants to have a usual or wants to try something new! God bless this place."}
{"text":"Brianna and Mark are awesome! Give them a raise! lol but seriously great food, great service, and great atmosphere ... we will definitely be back! The glazed bacon appetizer is a must and we had the Hawaiian pizza it was delicious crust is on point which is hard to do! See you soon and thanks again!"}
{"text":"Ima fan! Some places just have a genuine good vibe to them and others try too hard. This was a dope find cuz i really don't hang much at or around Arrowhead. Can't say enough good things about staff and shout to our server Cheyanna, she was great. This place is like a well oiled machine where everyone helps everyone unselfishly.   The wings were on point and it's hard to find a good wing these days; most usually serve up small wings n hustle u for $10-$12, u order 12 but are still hungry. Bubba's are big, tender, crispy, fresh, and the hot sauce is unique, great flavor and a different kind of texture (see pic) but still has the classic hot wing taste. That's the mild in the pic but it packs a gd amount of heat which was a nice surprise. They also don't trip about asking for an extra side of ranch or blue cheese or trying another sauce like most will add on random .50 fees.   Oh, and ur first check in u get their chorizo queso dip for free or fried pickles. Fun, loud game time type atmosphere with a bunch of TV's and great staff."}
{"text":"We will be back for sure. We came here on father's day and it was only a 20 minute wait. Win. All if the staff that we came into contact with were so nice but our waitress Jill was the star. She was so sweet and genuinely seemed to care about our experience which is hard to find now days. My husband had the blueberry lemonade which is what I'll be having next time for sure. We ordered the Bubba's Fiest Dip and it was just ok. It was like a hot layered bean dip. My mom and I shared a 12in Goat Cheese Arugula pizza and it was the perfect size. The pizza itself was out of this world. The pizza crust was handmade and and we added Canadian bacon which was not needed because the flavor from the goat cheese and balsamic was spectacular by itself. My 5 and 8 year old had individual cheese pizzas from the kids menu (4 slices each) which they loved but the pizzas are big and we left with a to-go box with 4 sliced. My husband had the bacon cheese burger with loaded tater tots on the side and left happy. We will for sure be back... such great food and better service."}
{"text":"They nailed It! Sports bar/restaurant done right. Welcoming, friendly staff. Overwhelming amount of TVs and staff. Loud, casual sports bar with something on the menu for everyone. Burgers, pizza, salads, wings, etc. Fun drink menu. $4 Long Island Ice Tea all day. Large bar and patio area. I used the Yelp check-in for yummy chorizo queso dip. Our waitress,Julie was super nice and attentive. She had them switch one of the Tv's to an NHL game for my son. I enjoyed my Philly cheese steak pizza. It was loaded with toppings and WAY better quality than expected. My son enjoyed the fish and chips and really liked the fries. Very well done, especially impressive since only open for less than 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Had the teenager with us tonight, and was skeptical about taking her here, because I thought that it was a typical sports bar kind of place. Turns out, it's not! We were immediately offered garage seating or dining room. We chose the dining room. Our server was super attentive, had our drinks to us in a matter of seconds! We ordered fried pickles with Bubba sauce and they were delicious! Thin and crispy.  It was hard to decide on entrees because everything sounded good. We ordered the chicken strips and shrimp, the aloha burger and the salmon. We were shocked when the food arrived...it was a lot of food! Huge portions! Everything was really good, and I liked the coleslaw so much that I got a side to take home. We were offered drinks to go, which was nice.  So glad that we finally have a local place to go that is new and offers food that is made fresh in house!"}
{"text":"This establishment just opened two weeks ago. I ate in the \"garage\" area. Food was good. Solid selection of draft beers. TVs throughout.  I thought this would be a good place to watch college football and basketball...until I realized they have DIRECTV. Bubba's has ASU and UofA pennants on the wall. Unfortunately, cannot watch Pac-12 games there if they are aired on the Pac-12 network since DIRECTV does not carry the Pac-12 network."}
{"text":"Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't really fab either.  We were seated very quickly, and our server was very helpful and friendly.  Our table ordered a starter, two burgers, and chicken tenders. The starter came out relatively soon after ordering, but the burgers and chicken took much longer.   Our burgers were pretty dry, and the blackened bleu burger had no flavor of the Cajun spices mentioned on the menu. Fries got good reviews, as did the ranch dressing and \"Bubba's Sauce\".  The side salad was good size but it's disappointing it was all iceberg lettuce. Even a couple of leaves of romaine or spinach would have helped spruce it up.    Wall to wall TVs which is good if you're going to watch the game or whatever, but it was a little distracting, and the music level was too loud for normal conversation.  It wasn't an experience that will bring us back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!    Special shout out to our great server James. He made our first experience wonderful and a big reason we loved the place so much!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries, the price was reasonable. Our waitress, Paige, was the best. If the others are like her then this is the best burger place I have ever eaten at!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing.    Food was yummy.  I felt that there were plenty of options of menu items to make anyone happy.   Our table had burgers, pizza, steak sandwich and chicken sandwich.   All satisfying!  Dr. Pepper bacon and mozzarella sticks appetizers were yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Bubba's for the first time tonight-it was great!   Atmosphere: Great set up with two sides... One side is a regular dining room while the other is a very large bar area with a ton of tables and TVs. Definitely a good place to have happy hour, or take family including kids. The lighting and the music we're good and the crowd was eclectic in a good way.   Our waitress, Brianna was awesome. She was prompt, polite, and sweet. She gave us menu recommendations and all and all repped this place really well.   The drinks: my hubby had a beer and I tried the apple pie mule. The mule was super tasty-good ginger beer and the addition of the Fireball made it off the charts.  The food: we just came in for some appetizers which worked out well. First let me just say that all of our apps came out at the same time which was great and I have to say rare. It's nice to have everything all at once to choose from. We got a free app with our Yelp check-in which were the fried pickles, they were really good.  We also had wings..6 hot and 6 with the dry Cajun rub. The wings were a really good size, definitely not puny. They tossed the wings in just the right amount of hot sauce and the flavor was good. I lived the dry rub-just enough spice. The last thing we tried were the Shotgun shrimp. This was definitely my favorite! Lightly fried shrimp in a perfectly spicy sauce over thinly sliced and fried potatoes strings. Tasty!!!  We will definitely be coming back here to watch some games and will definitely be bringing the kids. I will say that their kids menu had six different options and the pricing was great. Look forward to coming here again and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The pizza was phenomenal!!!   Definitely will be back again.   Great service, fun atmosphere, stop in and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Hands down the best onion rings I have had in my entire life. Burger was really good as well. Tons of TVs and good music playing."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us came here during dinner time on a weeknight and sat in the bar area. Service was very slow at our table. The food was ok but nothing special for the area. I hope it makes it in that cursed building (it's been at least 3 different restaurants now...right?) because I'd like to see it around football season with all the TVs they have."}
{"text":"We tried this new place RIGHT!!! it was named Bubba's 33 RIGHT!!!! this place was AMMMMAAAZING!!!! We ordered a full order of BOMB onion rings! the batter was amazing and crispy and it had a good flavor! They served it with ranch and Bubba's sauce which was kind of smoked and BBQ flavor! IT WAS DELICIOUS TO SAY THE LEAST! I ordered the Habanero burger with a SIDE OF FIRE FRIES(DO NOT GET THESE IF YOU ARE A PANZY, THEY ARE NOT KIDDING WHEN THEY SAY FIRE FRIES) I absolutely loved and savored every bite! My server was very fast and attentive she made sure we knew the menu inside and out so we didn't miss out on anything! The happy hour deals are amazing MONDAY(build your own burger 6.99) and TUESDAY(pizza and fries for like $10) they had different deals on alcohol! ATMOSPHERE is cool, i wouldn't mind going here for dinner with my family and kids, wouldn't mind coming here on a date, i wouldn't mind hanging out all Sunday here watching football! I can not wait to come back here again to try new things on the menu! if you are looking for a place to eat this is the place TOOOOOOO GOO! :)"}
{"text":"Warning it's loud in here. We ate in the restaurant side rather than in the garage side as they call it which is their predominantly bar area. There are lots of TVs so it'll keep you entertained. Service was good food was good just have to be careful their bacon was not cooked very well. I had the bacon burger with a beef patty so it could be cooked well done. Hubby had the Philly cheesesteak very greasy. We started with onion rings and they were very salty but they were tasty with a light batter."}
{"text":"New place.... food was Average I ordered the Philly steak sandwich I wasn't that impressed. My son stated the burger was really good that he had. My friend had a sandwich She said it was average. It was very busy inside the waitress was a bit slow. We'll give it a try again hopefully they're just ironing out some of the kinks of being new"}
{"text":"First time here. Restaurant was nice. Food was ok. They charged us for our kids drink even though it was supposed to be free with kids purchase. Didn't notice until we left."}
{"text":"Good pizza,good burgers. To be fair,we didn't eat in,but took home."}
{"text":"Fun place!  Great burger!  Lots of TV's to watch sports events. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so good..I would have taken pictures but it was good didn't think of it. Appetizers-Big of Rings and Fried Pickles are to die for!! Seriously Pizza and burgers are AWESOME!! Chicken tenders are juicy with little breading. Tv's are everywhere music is a variety of every Era! Great place to be at"}
{"text":"I understand restaurants when they first open have their growing pains and we where fully prepared for mediocre service but not for bad food.  Came here for a late dinner after the DBACKS game on Mother's Day. The wait staff needed some serious help, I knew we'd be in for a challenging experience when our waiter didn't know what sweet and low was.  They was 4 of us in our party and we tried to ask some questions about the food and menu but he clearly didn't know his product so we just ordered burgers.  My husband ordered his med rare it was delivered to the table with a marker stuck in the bun that said medium rare but as you can see from the photo it clearly wasn't.  Told the waiter is was not prepared right he just said hmmmm sorry, didn't offer to fix it or get the manager.  We asked what the difference between regular and fire fries the waiter said one has spices.  We ordered fire fries expecting cajin spiced fries, what I received is fries so over spicey they burned your mouth and stomach.  I could only eat a few that where dunked in ranch dressing just to be able to tolerate them.  My burger was dry and over cooked as well .  Needless to say it was an all round bad experience and we won't be back anytime soon (if ever) the night  ended in stomach pain and antacids."}
{"text":"Wow great place amazing food. Tons of tvs they will tune in any game you want. I had the salmon which was fantastic, family had the burger, pizza, lasagna and California Chicken which they loved, happy hour specials look great, 4 dollar long island ice teas. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came in expecting regular ol' bar food but we were pleasantly surprised! First, our server (Jill) was amazing; very friendly, knowledgeable, and speedy! I started with a HH Long Island for $4. I was expecting a weak, watered down drink but it was great! We ordered the glazed bacon and the onion rings for an appetizer. Both were delicious! My husband and I both ordered burgers. I got the bacon burger (with ground up bacon in the patty and slices on top). He ordered the sunrise burger (same as mine but with a fried egg on top). We could not stop raving about how good the food was. We will definitely be back! For the handful of people that gave negative reviews, you need to give Bubba's a second try!"}
{"text":"Service was good after the second time the food not being cooked the way I wanted it the quality of the food was poor. Will not recommend it and will not return"}
{"text":"If you get the chance to stop into Bubba's, definitely try to have Stephanie as your waitress. She went above and beyond what she needed to do and made our dining experience wonderful. The food was amazing and all, but honestly, if the food was bad, we would still come back for Stephanie! Thanks a lot!"}
{"text":"Placed order to go. They advised 15-20 mins. Waited 40 mins before getting our food and it was not very busy.  They did not even offer to discount anything or even offer a free pizza or something next time. Not sure I will ever go here again but I wont recommend take out to anyone thats for sure."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the multiple visits I've had to bubbas 33. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. Most importantly, their beer is ice cold.  I would recommend bubbas if you're in the neighborhood. It's great."}
{"text":"What a great mix of environments.  My mom and I had lunch there today and we sat in the open seating bar area.  It's definitely a great place to pop in with friends, have a couple of beverages with plenty of TVs and music playing.  The burgers are huge and incredibly flavorful.  The Habanero burger has just the right kick and when paired with the fire fries it's a perfect way to get the sinuses opened up.  Our server Megan (apologies if spelled wrong) was incredible.I don't think either of us had a drink that reached the bottom before she was there with a fresh one.  She checked on us enough so that we knew she was there if needed but not so much that she was intrusive.  If I were training a new server, she would be my example of how it's done right.  If the slightly noisy side isn't what you are looking for, they have a restaurant side with booths that is nice and quiet.  Can't beat that.  Best of both worlds.    Looking forward to more Friday lunches!"}
{"text":"Was staying in this area for business and this place was recommended. Both times we sat in the bar side of the restaurant but there are plenty of tables in that area. We were seated at a table the service was eh, so-so.  The food definitely made up for the lack of service. We got wings and onion rings for appetizers both of them were amazing. The entrees were very good as well. I would recommend just know that you will not be getting top-notch service"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. That's the best word to describe Bubba's 33. My first visit was terrific! It was a Saturday evening after seeing a movie and the place was hopping. My party ordered a little bit of everything: onion rings, pizza, wings, salad, and a bacon burger. Our food came out hot, fresh, and so delicious.  On my second visit, the restaurant was nearly empty (but it was also a Wednesday night). This time we ordered onion rings, a burger and a pizza. The onion rings came out piping hot (the best way to eat them!) but the burger had definitely been sitting for a while - the bread was soggy. The pizza was fine.  On the third visit, I was hopeful. It was a Saturday evening after a movie, just like the first time. The place was busy and the environment had a good vibe. Unfortunately, the food fell short of expectations. We ordered cheese fries, chicken strip salad and a pizza. It felt like our food was taking a while but finally the cheese fries arrived nice and hot, so we were good to go. But then...we just kept waiting. Our server came over three times saying she would check on our food but it was never ready. On her fourth checkup, she brought our food! Except...the pizza wasn't hot anymore and the chicken on the salad was lukewarm. I'm not sure how long it has been sitting in the kitchen but it was disappointing. We boxed the pizza and warmed it up at home and left the salads untouched.  I want to recreate my first experience because Bubba's 33 had me at hello but they've lost me at least for a little while."}
{"text":"Had their Monday burger special and it was great! Queso chorizo dip, fried pickles and mozzarella sticks..yum!! And let's not forget the beer..ice cold! None of our party of five had a complaint. Also checked in on Yelp and the queso was free! Will be back!"}
{"text":"First timers!   And if you check in with Yelp you get a free appie!  The fried pickles are great and very different.  We should have split the personal pizza.  I could only eat half. Server was great!   Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Bubba's 33.  Our sweet waitress, Hayden, explained everything to us about the menu & answered all of our questions.  She provided great recommendations for what to order.  We had onion rings for appetizer & they were amazing.  Lightly beer battered & served with Bubba's sauce.  To die for. The Black Bean burger is one of the best I've ever had. My party ordered bacon cheeseburgers and they were juicy & cooked to perfection.  A wonderful lunch. Atmosphere was lively and fun!"}
{"text":"great place just very greasy so if you down for some greasy burgers get it here but there very good and soft and the crafts are awesome as well"}
{"text":"Update: we gave this place a second chance.  Great food and great service.     We just were at the restaurant sat for 10 minutes with no service.  We were literally sitting behind the hostess and several waiters, hostesses and managers walked by and no one said anything.  We finally walked out I told the hostess what happened and she did nothing!  Great customer service.  So disappointed the menu looked great but I shouldn't  have to beg for service."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant.  Great scene, plenty of TVs.  I could easily see myself watching the Cardinals here.  Food: Bacon appetizer was outrageous!  So good.  Burger made with bacon Wow. Service: Joe was excellent, the bald one."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Happy Hour last Friday. The bar was busy and I had high hopes. Bottom line, the Happy Hour menu sucks. 1 beer, Rolling Rock, was on \"Happy Hour\" for $3.33. Yet he menu said it was \"3.33 all day, every day.\" So how is that a Happy Hour special? Anyway the larger Rolling Rock was $4.33. There was also a shot, margarita, and Long Island Ice Tea on Happy Hour too, which I wasn't interested in. I asked the waiter about Happy Hour food. There is none. Not even an appetizer on Happy Hour. Needless to say, with all the other choices in the P83 area, I will not be back here. Not sure if I'll even be back for dinner as my first experience was negative."}
