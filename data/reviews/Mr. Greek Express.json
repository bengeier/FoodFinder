{"text":"This is my first ever review on yelp and it was sadly propelled by the poor quality of food at this restaurant. My mom & I stopped in for a quick meal on the patio and both ordered chicken greek salads. Her chicken was undercooked and both of our salads consisted of brown lettuce, rotten cucumbers and lack of tzatziki sauce. This is  the first time I've experienced having to pay extra for tzatziki on my salad AT A GREEK RESTAURANT. Our waiter thankfully replaced her salad & gave her a chicken skewer (not the same as a full chicken breast, which originally came with the order, but nonetheless better than nothing.) no apology was offered. We will never be returning."}
{"text":"I use to love this restaurant for delivery, but I will never order from them again.  I placed my order early and after waiting one hour (weather was fine) was told my food would be delivered in 10-12 mins.  Manager told me I should have been told they were behind  when I placed the order but I wasn't and They have always delivered my food within 45 mins or less before.  Said he added two a Coke's to the order - I don't drink Coke so it meant nothing to me.  Another 15 minutes went by and no food so I cancelled my order.   Guys shows up but I refused the order.   Just be honest - u either missed the order or you were too busy and should have immediately compensated me for your mistake.  Very sad because when I do want Greek they have been my go to for quick delivery."}
{"text":"A great place to get good Greek food! You don't find many Greek restaurants in this area, let along a GOOD Greek restaurant!

The plates are generous and full. Great value meals!

The service is nice, the ambiance is nice (Greek music inside / nice patio right on Yonge street)!

The only drawback is that they take a little bit of time to get you the food (take out or dine in)."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area, I come to this place. Kind of pricey, but the staff are nice and quick. I've been here over 15 times and I have never had a problem.. well only once when a group of squealing girls were there for a birthday party (who has a birthday party at mr greek express?!?!). It's also very clean there. The food is amazing. Wide drink selection."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place can call itself express, ordered take out and it took 25 minutes for food to be ready. Staff were rude when asked how long the wait would be. 

Nothing special about the food either."}
{"text":"Been here twice but will not be going back anytime soon. Food is what u would expect from any other Greek Restaurant but the only difference is, u'll get it food on time. Their portions are good, that's  maybe to compensate for ur wait!! LoL. I came in one night around 10pm to grab pork souvlaki. She told me it'll take 10 mins and I was fine with that. newayz when it was done, I didt expect my food \"2Go\"!! cuz I ask the lady what time were they open till jst B4 I ordered, and she said 11pm. I was pretty sure I said \"for here\"!! To make the story short I ate there even it felt awkward. While the cleaning lady sat across me lQQkn more often than she should. I got the sense she wanted me to leave!! Well I left after having my meal never to come back."}
{"text":"I have tried chicken skewer a couple of days back. Ot was under cooked and the chicken was very think and hard to chew. It was like chewing celery. It was a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Received take-out the other day. It was alright, more or less what is expected from fast Greek food. The staff was friendly but unfortunately forgot to place one of the items I paid for in my bag. That's always a no-no.

Tatziki was kind of bland, as is common for fast Greek food. Chicken was decent, however.

Not a bad place to go to if you're in a rush. Just check to make sure you have everything before you leave."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. I think the place is privately owned. Details matter when they put out your dish. Food is consistently good and healthy with very little wait.

Chicken souvlaki with rice and salad is our regular choice."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get, extremely slow service. I will not be back.. the entire time I was eating my dinner I was thinking about the FIVE GUYS Burgers & Fries across the street.. i had to go to Dairy Queen afterwards because I was still hungry. A big guy like me needs to eat and the pita I got for 7+ dollars was way to small for the price.. no drink or fries included."}
{"text":"The entrees cost more on the delivery menu. Guess they just bake in delivery cost? Either way still very affordable and the pork sticks are delicious!! SO juicy."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food.   I had the Gyro with a side greek salad.  The Gyro was dry and lacked something.   The salad is nothing more than iceberg with some red onions, feta cheese, tomato and olives.  (Typical greek salad) .  I guess I have more of an issue with the price than the food.   For what I paid, I would rather eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Expensive for express kind of take away food court food I think. 

18$ for a large chicken dinner with 2 sides. Without even a drink 

Extra tzaziki tiny container is $1 something ! And the one it comes with is never enough. 

Not sure if it's worth the price but does taste good enough for me. I'm not of Greek origin but seems legit"}
{"text":"Been here twice, place so far is consistent. 

Liked the chicken and rice. Salad was fresh. Good filling meal.

Would come again."}
{"text":"If my usual coworker lunch group didn't enjoy this place so much, I wouldn't be coming here. It's not exactly a place I would go to on my own time.

The facility is nice, spacious and clean which is probably why I gave that extra 2 star bump, the staff is also really friendly and helpful too. But that's it, that's all that's good about this place.

The food is cooked like it's missing meaning to it. I may be expecting a little too much from a Greek fast food joint, but with other options of Greek fast food, this is certainly at the bottom of my list. 

Flavours are just missing that extra 'Umph' and the prices ... Man, don't even get me started on the prices. It just isn't worth it. Don't get me wrong, Greek places usually tend to run a little on the high side but the portions you get KINDA make up for it. But this place doesn't deserve a dime. Everything I eat here it always tastes sour not savoury.

I just don't get that same 'Homey' feeling I usually do when I eat at other Greek places. I personally hate giving such low ratings, but after being here a few times I just can't pull myself to go higher than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Mr Greek express, is great if you want that quick Greek meal on the go.  They have a decent selection of Greek favourites including burgers, souvlaki, gyros and various desserts.  Also the price is relatively inexpensive and comparable to McDonalds or Burger King.  This must be kept in mind when eating here.  This isn't some fine dining experience,  it's simple fast Greek food on the go.

I usually have the calamari with the chicken souvlaki and the souvlaki comes with rice and potatoes.  There is a large portion of food and it's very easy to share it with someone else.  The food is decent although the meat is usually a tad on the dry side.  The calamari is surprisingly juicy and well worth the money.

If you have room, there are various desserts as well.  The new Greek style frozen yogurt is great and is a nice alternative to other ice creams available.  If I'm in the area and need a quick bite, I wouldn't mind coming back here."}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner here earlier tonight, I had the traditional gyro pita with beef and lamb. Even though this is an express place, it still took a while for the food to come out. They even serve it to you too if you plan to dine in.

The pita was good but seemed like they just slapped on all the ingredients in."}
{"text":"I come here often and can't believe I've never written a review. But anyways, since this location has been under new management, their service has greatly improved! Staff greet/thank you upon arrival/exit and are all friendly. 

The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating for being express. It's clean and tables are always cleared for the next customer. 

The food is your average Greek food at less than average dine-in restaurants but more than mall prices. Also, the portion sizes for the price paid is great (the portions are huge). 

I like the veggie souvlaki dinner which comes with rice, a whole tomato slices in half and grilled with feta on top, and a sliced pita -- I really enjoyed this! My boyfriend always gets the chicken souvlaki dinner with rice and salad as sides (two souvlaki sticks of chicken are included). Overall, however, I'd say the prices are more on the higher end. 

There's a point in time where I stopped coming here for a couple of months because of a negative experience with a staff member but I'm glad to see all the new staff are very friendly and welcoming so I will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"I went there on Friday because Jimmy the Greek at Sheppard Centre was closed. I have to say going there was a big mistake. Jimmy the Greek makes so much better food with cheap prices. I love Jimmy the Greek's roast chicken dinner, but it seems Mr. Greek Express didn't have anything like that, so I ordered some chicken breast, which was under their chef specialties category. The girl asked me if I wanted 1 piece chicken breast or 2, I said 1. When the \"chef\" put the chicken breast on the grill, I was like \"that small\"?! The price for the meal was like 12.95 or something plus tax, so I expected more than that small piece. Anyways it took them like 10 mins to make a express meal like that. The veggies in the meal had no taste, the rice was too salty, the chicken was just chicken, nothing special about it. I was charged over $16 for that meal and a bottle of vitamin water. Oh btw the staff wasn't nice, especially there was an Indian looking guy, it seemed like he hated me or something. I would never go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary here, just average fast-food style Greek inspired menu , delivered fast and friendly. A good spot for a quick bite in an area filled with other also good options."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here rather than my usual take-out stop, The Friendly Greek, because of the word Express in its name. It wasn't really the express, more like the milk run. Very friendly service, nice, clean restaurant, and a patio right on Yonge, but I waited more than 20 minutes for a pork souvlaki dinner and a Greek salad with a chicken breast ($25). The food was decent though unexceptional. I'll try it again, when I have a little more time. Did I say the people were nice?"}
{"text":"$10 for a big plate of food (gyros, fries, greek salad, tskiki tziki creamy greek yogurt/cucumber sauce, and pita). It comes out quick.

Not many places in North York for a quick Greek fix. I can't say Mr. Greek Express will satisfy you 100%. The gryos was a bit dry. The  tskiki tziki creamy greek yogurt/cucumber sauce needed a bit more zip. The fries, however, first rate. And it's pretty hard to mess up a Greek salad. Nice patio for a quick after movie meal.

Use the counter to order take out. Table service available for dining in."}
{"text":"It is ok. The Greek food can be healthy even in a fast food like this with potatoes, salad and chicken plate."}
{"text":"Pretty generic stuff, but tasty enough for a three-star review.

That said, I would like to continue my personal war on the cheapness of delivery garlic bread.  Please, a damp hotdog bun with a spread of garlic butter is NOT garlic bread.  Garlic bread is crispy and toasted.  A limp hotdog bun just degrades your product.  Honestly, how much does a baguette and a minute in the oven cost you?"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and they have the best Greek yogurt cheesecake I had in a looooong time. 2 thumbs up guys!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another try! What a waste of time! Should have drove 10mins east to Greektown!  My main showed up before my salad! So when I ask for my salad it came after eating the salad guess what was cold my main. Place is a waste of money! Never stepping foot in here. I have to give it 1 star to post a review! Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this particular Mr. G. Xpress and they're sitll working on our first order! LoL !
Both times we had the same experience. The people working here have the worst customer service skills, and OMG are they S-L-O-W !! 
Seriously though, if you are going to a movie at this mall and need a quick bite before.... plan to go to a later show and eat somewhere else. Take your time and get a good meal but do NOT eat here. We can't figure out how the heck this shop could still be here after so long. 
I ordered a Pork Souvlaki, it was over cooked to the point of being burnt. The big guy ordered Falafel. This isn't Falafel, it is FAL-AWFUL !
Mr Greek started out on the Danforth, and it was an icon over there. This is such a poor representative for Mr. Greek, and they should just take the word \"Express\" out of the name."}
{"text":"After learning my lesson the last time over a year ago, I was craving Greek food and decided to give this spot another shot. Meh. Same problems.

The \"dinners\" are horribly overpriced for what you get. Order a gyros dinner and you'll get 5 or 6 slices of gyros on a plate piled deceptively high with your chosen sides, making it look like a healthy portion but really...your plate is 90% side dish and 10% main. Everything else, the wraps, sides, etc are overpriced as well but not to the same level. 

Stick to the sandwich/pita options, more bang for your buck. Or better yet, drive a little further to the Danforth and have a really nice meal at any number of Greek spots. 

Food is decent tasting considering it's mostly served up cafeteria style. I think only the souvlaki is grilled fresh. Maybe the burgers...but have never seen anybody order one. 

Clean spot, comfortable booths, nice staff."}
{"text":"I had my second visit at this location last night. The first time was for a birthday since this was his favorite greek place. After our visit last night, I can say that I will be back. The service is good, staff are friendly and the food is also delicious. Whenever I'm in Scarborough, this is the first place I think of to go to for food."}
{"text":"Why is zero stars not an option? 

The precooked chicken and to the overall poor food quality makes this place a easy choice never to visit again. There are plenty of decent mediterranean restaurants so why go to this dated, quality lacking establishment."}
{"text":"The food is ok but what a rip off for express food ...you are not even sitting at a restaurant ordering off a menu. 

I ordered the classic chicken skewer...but I wanted only salad (no rice or potatoes). 

It costs $14.95 so I could not understand why it rung up as $18.88. When I asked why so expensive they said they charge for extra salad when you don't want rice or potatoe. This is ridiculous and he should have told me when I placed the order. I found the cashier unfriendly and I walked out. 

No way am I spending my hard earned money at a place that charges for substituting a salad for a side dish....and especially at an express dining place."}
{"text":"Food is okay but very pricey for the quality.  Stopped going after a few times of the staff being rude and having a lousy additude."}
{"text":"I work in the tundra of Scarborough.  There's not that much around for lunch except chain places, exhibit A... Mr. Greek Express.  I go here more than I feel comfortable admitting.  The best thing I can say about it is you're always guaranteed a seat.

The service is pretty rubbish.  I've experienced waits that go beyond a reasonable definition of \"fast\" food.  The quality of food is what you'd expect.  The price point is the only saving grace, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We looked for a quick bite before we headed to the train station and we wanted to try a chicken souvlaki so we walked over to this fast food eatery.

Tables were uncleaned and those that looked cleaned had the debris of it's former occupants found directly on the floor.

The chicken was tasteless and their salad soaked in Greek vinigrette. We waited 20 minutes in a fast food joint. Our two combo plates cost us nearly $42! Wow! One word to describe our experience - Lousy. $-$$"}
{"text":"Wowww what's with all the bad reviews? 
But then again, not many people have reviewed lately :(
Anyways, been here already 4x, this is one of the best Mr.greek locations, food is Fresh, good quality and I also highly recommended if you order fried calamari for take out, stay in and eat, you need to eat them Golden and crispy. 
Great Food and big portions all the time :))
Keep up the great work mr Greek @young and Shepard xoxox"}
{"text":"The service seems better and friendlier and the food was delicious this time around.  The fried calamari dinner is always a favorite"}
{"text":"I never really liked Mr Greek restaurants so I don't know why I'd come to the express extention of this franchise but I was hungry and in the area craving Greek food so I thought I'd give it a shot since I remembered they had some pretty good lunch specials.

Unfortunately when I arrived there was no lunch menu anymore and prices seemed even higher then I remembered since the last time I was here which was a few months ago. 

My food was average at best and for $15.00 I expected more. The worst part was the $15.00 wasn't even enough for the classic dinner (Bigger protions and a extra side) that was close $20 bucks for that money I though I was on the Danforth haha.

I'd much rather go to a smaller old school Greek restaurant where the food is way better and way cheaper!"}
