{"text":"Had for the first time yesterday after moving into the neighbourhood. Very good pizza and garlic bread, garlic dipping sauce also very tasty. Will definitely get the pizza and garlic bread again and maybe check out some of the other menu items. Price is a little more then the competition but still worth it."}

Growing up this was one of the local pizza franchises in the neighborhood. It offered some of the only spiced potato wedges and they were amazing. Almost 20 years later, and it still has some of the best potato wedges.

The pizza and chicken are made well. This is definitely the better choice out of the pizza options. 

The owners are courteous and the food is always promptly prepared. 

They always have reasonable deals and the prices are acceptable. 

The store itself is a little small and doesn't have much space to sit, the looks are simple, but it is clean inside. 

I definitely recommend this place if you're craving pizza or potato wedges."}
