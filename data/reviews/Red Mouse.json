{"text":"Excellent place to hang out! They have a vast menu and dining area that is kid friendly. They have a ball field where they play softball and a volleyball court. The place is huge and very fun! I love the Wraps the best!"}
{"text":"Friendly bartender but seven bucks for a glass of beer and a soda in a rural bar?   Never again!"}
{"text":"Went for my first meat raffle.  I won two meat prizesand two free drinks.  Not bad for first time. Service was alright, but nothing much put on them from us, and drink specials were good. A lot bigger inside than I would have thought.    Friend had a steak sandwich and fries which he liked, but is way too greasy for me to even try.   Id go again for drinks and raffles!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer, strike up a conversation or just enjoy the games on the TV's.  Plenty of room for all that, great lunch special and bar food.  Good times."}
