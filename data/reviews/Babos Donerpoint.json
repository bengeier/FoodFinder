{"text":"First time coming here after passing it for years. Sister suggested it after my dad enjoyed it and my dad never eats out. Got the spicy beef wrap (Sadly they were out of chicken) and it was good for the most part. The wrap was massive for the little we paid for it. Definitely worth the 7$. My issues as stated above is A) they were out of chicken. B) The beef was a bit over cooked, a bit on the dry side. Even though we took it home instead of dining in, I think their tables are a bit cluttered and their furniture and building appearance seem run down, out of date and need an upgrade. Then again at the low prices with massive servings, I would give up decor for quality food any day. They also have drinks and desserts I've never heard of and curious to try. Definitely recommend and plan to go again sometime."}
{"text":"When they first opened they would offer you complimentary apple cider. 
Now they don't do that anymore I don't know why. 
The food is great. The people are nice. Price is reasonable. I get excited when I think of eating there."}
{"text":"Disgusting? Place is hot and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in decades. The server/cook was rude, didn't pay attention to the order I gave. Stove, grill, and prep area looked like it was cleaned or wiped with a dirty cloth. My plate/tray had food left over from whoever used it before.

There were some black teens just having some fun eating, somewhat noisy but that didn't mind me. Didn't seem to be the case with the woman serving/cooking. She called then Ni***re under her breath.

A few hours have passed by and I feel like puking,

WOULDN'T RECOMMEND EVEN TO MY HATERS!"}
{"text":"Delicious, traditional Turkish food. The döner is always on point and the baklava is the best I've ever had. The Apple Tea is a must every time I go to Babos. The guys always have a smile on and like to joke around with you. They put their heart and soul into everything they do there."}
{"text":"Second time going here and I had the chicken and beef platter on rice and it was plenty to split for $10 all-in!

Great spot to eat at if you're ever in the area but driving out to exit may be tough if you're trying to get onto Eglinton."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and portion size is large. Owner is very nice. The döner beef is great and even the chicken Greek salad is spot on. Only accepts cash and debit, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Small little whole in the wall type place with great staff and delicious food.  You get a lot for the price of the food.  For a meal of $10 you will be nice and full.  The chicken was nicely flavoured and came with salad and rice.  I would recommend getting it to go in case you can't finish all the food, you can take it with you.   I would recommend and would return."}
{"text":"When they are at their best 4 stars but lately the meat has been to fatty and their sauces are so tasteless might as well not add it(just makes the pita soggy)"}
{"text":"The portions are huge! My boyfriend and I each got a chicken wrap, but we easily could have gotten one wrap to share and still had too much food. Great quality, friendly and helpful staff AND free parking!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years. Everytime I get a small chicken wrap with everything on it. It is delicious. The meat is juicy, seasoned well and just a really good dish. It is reasonably priced as well. They give HUGE amounts of meat in their wraps which I love. They don't sting on anything. It's a family ran business which is nice and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. I go there often so they know me and always make sure I get what I need, sometimes if theres a long wait they offer me complementary apple cider or a piece of baklava which is delicious ! I will be going as long as they are open!
Great Place!
Great Food!
Great People!"}
{"text":"I laugh at these good reviews,  like someone said here absolutely true , those people have no taste"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service. Generous portions of quality ingredients  for a very fair price. The space and flavours are extremely authentic of eastern European doner joints. The walls are very nice and make sure to touch them with your fingers before you leave because its fun!"}
{"text":"The meat isn't that good. The garlic sauce sucks. Food handling is unhygienic. Guy works the cash and touches bread right after. Lots of young guys go but they obviously don't have good taste."}
{"text":"Good food, Great prices, Generous portions.

Babos Donerpoint is a good spot to fill up on Turkish/Middle Eastern cuisine. This is a great restaurant to come and visit if you're craving  for doner plates, doner wraps, or middle eastern salads.

The food is well prepared and made fresh with the meats being tender and juicy while the veggies are fresh and crunchy. 

The main attraction of this restaurant are the cheap prices and generous portion sizes. You can purchase a very FILLING meal for around $8-15 which is a bargain considering the large portion sizes. A medium plate is equivalent to 1.5 meals while a large plate is equivalent to 2 meals by my standards.

In terms of aesthetics, Babos is a \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurant. But don't let the looks of this restaurant mislead you, Babos' serves good food at great prices and generous portion sizes which makes this spot a place you should definitely check out if you happen to be in the area and craving for some Turkish food."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Been coming here for many years and many more to come. When it comes to take out food, it really is as good as it gets. I grew up in that general area, and my parents still live around there, so it was always our go to for last minute dinner take out. 

The owners are great. Very friendly and appreciative of your business. They always recognize me and my family when we go, and almost pick up right where we left off the last time...even if months have passed. On several occasions they have even given us their traditional turkish tea, and a bite of their delicious baklava on the house while we wait for our take out. 

I generally get the beef dinner, or the wrap. The portions are very filling. I eat A LOT, but still cant manage to eat one of their meals in one seating. They completely fill the take out containers for the dinners and stuff the wraps to the max. In their dishes, you have pretty much every element. You get the deliciously roasted protein, the filling tender rice, the crunchy refreshing elements from the tomato, onion, lettuce, and cabbage, and the moisture and creaminess from the delicious sauces they pour overtop. You can even get a kick of heat with their fantastic hot sauces that I would highly suggest. 

Im also fairly certain that everything is made in house because I've seen the mother on several different occasions down the stairs, pressing those awesome wraps. 

If you enjoy delicious food at a good price, and would like to support a local family owned business, I would highly suggest dining here. I couldn't be happier to support them and spread the word."}
{"text":"When looking for your Turkish Doner fix. This Bang for your buck spot has great tasting items. Jumbo Wraps, Chicken, beef and veggie options. Their Chicken Platter is filled to the brim with very very generous scrumdiddlyumptious goodness. Love their pepper sauce. The place does not pretend to be anything it's not. It's a hole in the wall with quick and friendly service. 
 Best Shawarma in town."}
{"text":"Good shit. 

If you eat chicken of beef plates. This place is the shit. 
The only rule: BRING CASH.

Your ass will get a boatload more than you're already getting. 

Most people get a plate which is 9$ and it will fill you up guaranteed."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma. This is incorrectly listed as a Greek and Turkish restaurant. It's actually Turkish. The food is incredible. Best shawarma wraps in the city of Toronto. A place with character."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been here a good 8+ times i'd say. I always order the chicken doner plate I believe it's called? It's delicious, i'd highly recommend that especially if it's your first time eating there (this dish was the first dish I tried there and I still get it whenever I go there to this day). It's such a great meal for the value! You get rice, chicken, salad, & a pita for only $10 - not to mention the two sauces they use are delicious! They also give you a pretty generous portion of food. I believe there's two owners or at least two main guys that work there that are fabulous! They're incredibly nice & make you feel so welcomed. The place is pretty small on the inside, but there is a patio to eat your meal in for warmer days/nights but I usually take my meal home. It is also conveniently located right in front of a bus stop for easy access."}
{"text":"My wife's first time for Greek food.  

This place is GOOD! Sorry not good, AWESOME!!!!
Price and portions are great!!!! 

We ordered number 15with chicken, rice, fries and a side salad.   aka, CHICKEN PLATTER.  

I'm full and my wife had to take some home.

Totally recommend!!! We will definitely go back for seconds, thirds and so on and so on.....

Just go and eat there, it's goooood!!
And it will fill you up!

??????? 8/10"}
{"text":"The place is not much but the food is delicious. If you're ever craving simple chicken on rice with some salad you've found your place. I picked up the chicken donër plate - $10 tax included. The chicken is prepared really well and the rice was fresh. There's space to sit and enjoy your meal if you're not in a rush. They have a good selection of items to choose from and you really can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this restaurant for about 4y years now. And I absolutely love their food here. I usually go for ther dinner plates. Wraps and their delicious lentil soup. 
If you like middle eastern/turkish food. This is the best spot for you.

Food: 4.5/5 - big portions. Wraps and medium size dinner plates are good portions for 2 people. Eveything is served with their salad and if you order a dinner plate, it will come with complimentary pita.
Must also try their baklava for dessert, that is if you still have room for dessert :p

price: definitely affordable. From $5-$15

Ambiance: 3/5 not the prettiest restaurant but food is what truly matters

Location: ttc accessible (bus stop right in front of the restaurant), free parking, you wont miss it.


The person (big muscular turkish man) is always friendly, and always smiling I always call him \"my friend\"."}
{"text":"It's like crack. The portions are huge. I usually go for the mixed plate. Rice, salad, chicken, beef, sauce and a pita. $9. The service is wonderful and the one guy is hilarious. I haven't seen him not make someone smile. The wraps are also amazing. It's like the size of your forearm. If you finish it in one sitting you're not sure if you should be proud or sad. Sometimes it hurts. It's so good. The sauce!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here but I have to say:

Awesome Food
Awesome Value
Awesome Service

The chicken-beef doner wrap with cabbage is filling, nutritious and not too heavy."}
{"text":"This place was OK. First off, my brother and I were looking for a Greek place in the area, found this place on Yelp. It's definitely not Greek. 
Food was okay. Staff were OK. 
Portions are huge, one meal can be split between two people if you're not too hungry. 
I would go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Pretty cheap considering they stuff your take out container to the point of bursting. One of my favorite doner places."}
{"text":"the young girl behind the counter has no customer service skills at all!!
its as if she was doing me a favor, didn't greet or look at me until I didn't speak and stared at her waiting for at least a \"hi what can I get you?\" with a smile which I didn't get at all throughout the transaction.
the big guy never says \"thank you\" after you've paid unless you tip him.  Its take out!
food is good."}
{"text":"Amazing beef shawarma, incredible homemade hot sauce.  The owner/chef is misunderstood in his genius!"}
{"text":"Dingy little place, but aside from that the food is AMAZING!!! Love it and it is so cheap when you see how much you get. My faves are the chicken or beef (or get them mixed) plates with all the veggies.  They literally overfill the takeout box so you will definitely be stuffed! Two people who are medium eaters can easily share a box."}
{"text":"Very generous portions and friendly service! It's great to see a family owned and run restaurant making great food for the local community! The beef is not some \"beef-like\" substance like at some other doner places...it's actual BEEF! Delicious marinated meat piled high on a bed of rice and fries!"}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices, and amazing portion sizes"}
