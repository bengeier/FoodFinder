{"text":"Great food. Especially Tapanyaki. There are 3 very big Tapanyaki tables that could accomodate 50 people or so. Make sure you make reservations.
For sushi, you are most likely to find tables just by walk-ins."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family for ages! They have two options, you can eat teppanyaki or eat in the dining room. Personally i love the food here because the portions are good and the food is great! (fyi, when i say food i mean everything except the sashimi.. i don't know why but i have never gotten sashimi here before lol!)

Some things you should try - chicken teriyaki, beef short ribs (amazing!), beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, new york roll (salmon skin with teriyaki sauce) and mango avacado roll! They also come with a good amount of vegetables! and for some reason.. the broccoli is so yummy, cooked but crunchy at the same time haha 

Also when you eat teppanyaki, the chefs do do tricks like the onion volcano and some egg spinning thing. I think you just need to ask them and they even let you try it too!

Service wise they aren't too shabby (for an Asian place) soo yeahh that's all i have to say about that lol

overall.. i think it's a good family restaurant and it's worth going during lunch! Dinner... not so much because you pay more but you get the same amount of food the lunch go-ers get.

p.s. I don't think it's thousand island sauce they use on the salad.. it looks like it but it tastes different to me.. it somehow makes the salad taste so good haha"}
{"text":"The place is not closed AT ALL.
They have changed their name about 6 months ago to FUSHIMI.
I used to go there before they changed to FUSHIMI and it is ass good (if not better) then before. Great place, good food, good service."}
{"text":"2003-2010. My laptop died and I'm so sad... we've been through so much together: exams, essays, assignments, youtube, MSN, Facebook, myspace, heartbreaks, msn, etc etc.... so until I'm done mourning for my friend, my reviews will be rather limited. RIP my friend, we had a good run.

Like I said in my last review, I went back! This place is awesome, though the service was kind of crummy this time. BUT I very much enjoyed a big bowl of veggie soba soup noodles... it was delicious and very satisfying, it came with an abundance of veggies (they didn't skimp on the veggies!! Which is AWESOME!) and it was only $6.95 and 50 cents more for soba instead of udon!

Soba noodles + Japanese broth soup + corn + seaweed + carrots, mushrooms + broccoli + green onions = a very happy ME! 

You betcha I'll be back for more soba veggie soup noodles!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been, but with no reviews currently on record, I had to say *something*.

Taste of Japan is a decent teppanyaki joint near Markham's tech section. The ingredients have always been high quality and the prices reasonable - typical lunch is starter sushi, salad, miso soup and then a couple meats plus some fried rice from the cooking tables, all for $12-$15. if you're having trouble choosing, they do a pretty mean shrimp flamb√©, and their beef is also well executed.

As teppanyaki places go, though, pretty sedate. I'm accustomed to a cooking table atmosphere being really active and energetic - fun, engaged chefs, knifeplay, &c. This place is really all business and whereas that would be just fine in most realms, it's sort of out of character, here.

They have regular tables as well, if you want to skip the show but if you're not looking for teppanyaki, I'm not sure why you'd choose this spot.

Can get busy around peak lunchtimes, calling ahead is recommended and if you're aiming for Friday, maybe even calling the day before."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes the best salmon roses. Unfortunately it seems they will be closing down in mid-November."}
{"text":"A Taste of Japan was one of the first Japanese restaurants I went to when I was young. The prospect of watching food cooked before my eyes teppanyaki-style or the variety of options from the bento boxes was always an exciting adventure. 

The lunch menu options are reasonably price, though the dinner pricing fairs close to the price to an All-You-Can-Eat Japanese dinner buffet elsewhere. With the emergence of so many Japanese restaurants around, it had dampen the once crowded atmosphere to a quiet few around the peak lunch hours. Quality of food has definitely gone downhill compared to it's once glorious days,  and for the price you pay for just mediocre food, most customers decide to go AYCE instead."}
{"text":"This was the best place in Markham for teppanyaki.  Used to come here with co-workers all the time.  Too bad it's closed now.  :-("}
{"text":"sat in dining room. selection combos not great at all. was difficult to decide what to order.  when the salad and soup came. wow. disgusting. lame iceberg lettuce nothing in it. our sushi/sashimi was not fresh, not rolled properly. donburi was bland. food was garbage. overpriced for what you get. do not recommend. would not come back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi place that's within takeout lunch-distance of work. Unfortunately, the search must continue. I ordered the base sushi lunch combo, called in and then picked up within 10 minutes or so.

I'm not that picky when it comes to sushi. I love the good stuff, but I'll still eat the middle-of-the-road stuff you find on Bloor. This meal sits with 4 pieces of sushi uneaten. The highlight of a sushi meal should not be the miso soup, but that was it. The salad was 3 leaves of iceburg lettuce with thousand island dressing, literally nothing else in the box. 

The sushi... well, it just looks off. Kind of like it's been sitting out for a long time and the outside of it's sort of dried out. I ate the shrimp, which was rather rubbery and raised some flags, so I examined the salmon, with its white-ish outer coating, and the tuna, with it's brown edges, and decided to pass on the rest of it. I ate the salmon and cucumber rolls, since they had minimal fish in them anyway, and the salmon had a roll of rice to protect it from drying out.

Maybe it's better when you're in for the teppanyaki and the food's actually being made fresh, but this takeout is disgusting."}
