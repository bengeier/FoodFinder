{"text":"This place is my new favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas. Try #2 Boat, this is sushi combo comes with sushi, sashimi, rolls and soup. My girl friend loved this. She didn't like raw food before but now she asks me to go again."}
{"text":"Went here twice, one for dinner last week and late lunch yesterday. I was coming from downtown and it took me less then 10 min!! GREAT FOOD and Service!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good but more importantly the service was great. I was a little worried because I was the only one in at the time but their chef reassured me and recommended me a roll. Also, the female servers were very friendly. I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Misleading description here on Yelp and repeatedly by their staff. They claimed here that sashimi is included in the all you can eat menu. This is important to us because my wife cannot eat rice for medical reasons. The waiter assured us twice that sashimi is included. But only after we drove 20 minutes, settled at our table, and ordered or food and waited 10 minutes, did a stone faced and incredibly arrogant manager coming out to say that sashimi is not part of deal. What a terrible place!"}
{"text":"Sushi? On the east side? *Record skip* Mixed in with a million jaliscos, taquerias, and mariscos is Sushiro, tucked into a plaza with a karaoke joint, a clothing outlet, and a Mexican grocery store. If I lived nearby, I'd probably round up just for the convenience of finally having sushi nearby but I ultimately went with three stars because I'd personally drive further to go elsewhere. But this place is A-OK.  They offer AYCE and a la carte, with limited nigiri but reasonable pricing. I opted for the chirashi ($15) which the chef didn't seem to know how to make but he was shown by what appears to be the owner. You can't compare this dish to the chirashis you get for twice the price, but there were a few things to make this version unique- bed was a mix of lettuce and rice, the rice was hot and overly seasoned with eel sauce, and the dish was served with two sauces (spicy chili sauce and a spicy mayo sauce), which were appreciated but unwarranted. The fish was passably fresh, though the shrimp had seen better days. I'm not usually a fan of tamago, and this version had several pieces that seemed to be grilled, which leant an extra layer of flavor and texture that I enjoyed.   All  in all, my meal was okay. I was the only diner on a weekday during prime dinner hours and the service was fittingly attentive. The dining room is large and clean, and I like that they were playing Jiro Dreams of Sushi  over the bar as I enjoyed my solo sushi meal. I'd pop by again if work brings me to the area again."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and need sushi this place is A-OK. The place is located in a strip mall towards the right corner, so parking is fine.   We ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer, tempura roll, golden roll, caterpillar and dragon. All the rolls came out tasting fine. The only thing is that the food came out at different times. I think we actually never received two of the appetizers due to the crazy is the food delivery. :(  All the sushi was up to par. I would come back, but make sure you get all your stuff!"}
{"text":"I'm here almost every weekend with husband, we really enjoy this place food is great and fresh I really recommend this place.  See you this weekend!"}
{"text":"Not that many sushi spots on this side of town that do all you can eat and offer GREAT SERVICE (Mariel was the server) ! Rolls were great pretty much got a half roll of each to try them all and see which ones I would get more of next time I stopped by. Definitely recommend the Mexican, white orgasm and popcorn lobster.  Now some of the cons I did see a couple of flys. The edamade was pretty cold and didn't really like how the Golden California roll tasted even (probably because it was deep fried). All in all a good place to eat and if you live on This side of town you don't have to drive 30 min to get good sushi and good service, plus when I went they weren't packed so I didn't have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Loved coming here! Attentive & friendly staff. Stopped by twice in a week & even orders sushi to go :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and I haven't had one bad experience! The customer service is great , I ordered sushi (nigiri) and it was very tasty and fresh also had the regular spicy tuna roll , salmon roll . Only complaint is a small amount of ginger but they brought some so overall a great sushi spot"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for pickup. They forgot my Mochi Ice Cream. I was going to drive back for it but then realized that they didn't even give me the right receipt... the place has a nice atmosphere and we were greated when entering. My only complaint is that they need to be more cautious with orders. They had 30 minutes to make sure they got my order right. It was not busy and that tells me that they were too lazy to double check on my order. This isn't a fast food restaurant so there's no excuse for such mistakes."}
{"text":"Good food, atmosphere and good service! In a great location and friendly staff.  I do wish they had fountain drinks instead of can that is the only negative I've seen."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and it's awesome!!Tried the \"I love my ass roll\" and wow.It has fresh torched tuna on the top.Very very good.Super was really good and the location is very clean.Bathroom looked great aswell."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from us, and we found ourselves here one afternoon while craving for sushi.  We were greeted with shouts of \"irrashaimase\" upon entry. The super white tuna is a favorite of my boyfriend, who said, \"this is the first time I've enjoyed super white tuna with anything on it\"- the sauce they put on was light and didn't ovepower the subtler flavor of the fish. For being so far off the beaten path for most sushi restaurants most of the fish was pretty good, though the squid was still partially frozen in some spots. We didn't try too many specialty rolls though we both enjoyed how fresh and light the rock and roll was, a cucumber based roll...available most places. The squid tempura was alright, and while takoyaki (misspelled as \"taco\"yaki) were a fun thing to find they certainly are not comparable to the real things. We also sampled uni shooters, something not listed on the menu but they were happy to make it when we inquired. There were lots of options available for any other diners who choose to go the AYCE route, as we did. They've got rice bowls, sushi boats (no longer), sashimi... worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood and really need sushi. One thing to note is that the restaurant is still pretty young and they seem to have a high turn over, so presentation isn't very consistent over multiple visits. The same rolls will look completely different during the same meal, and some items have either removed from the menu now or served/made differently. Uni and ikura have been limited to one gunkanzushi for an order, unlike other AYCE places that serve two per order. I've witnessed several tense interactions while dining involving the staff, both with servers and visitors, which makes the small restaurant uncomfortable. Maybe in time they'll work out the kinks. The servers we've met were all sweet  and the food's not bad, just needs more time to find their groove if the restaurant is able to get footing in an unlikely area. Personally, after seeing how the staff are treated I'm not going back ever again."}
{"text":"4 Stars - I enjoyed the experience.  I will want to come back again even if there is a wait or if I'm not in the area.  Will recommend this place to friends and family.  Food - I would say this is one of the better AYCE in town.  We came here after volunteering at the nearby Salvation Army.  To be honest, because of the plaza it's in, we weren't expecting much.  It's a very nice surprise.  It has the best yellowtail amongst the AYCE restaurants.  Service - the waitress was clearly new to the sushi game but was very friendly.    I took a star off because the some of the food I ordered didn't come."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in the city. The customer service is always great, and the sushi is always fresh. After living in Japan for several years, my family and I have been on the hunt for some fresh sushi. Try it, you won't be disappointed! We will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Good food. Mariel is awesome.  Rolls come out fast.  Nice change from always having to eat Mexican haha.  Food looks nice and presentable. Inside looks nice. Decent price. $21 for all you can eat.  Mochi was good too. Plan to come more often."}
{"text":"I loved the Lobster Rolls and just the overall atmosphere of Sushiro, I would definitely recommend those wanting to try sushi for the first time to try Sushiro."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! This little sushi joint was incredible.. the Best Service I have had. The food came out super fast and was delish. Try the Screaming Orgasm.. the prices were very reasonable as well.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Sushiro es un pequeño pero muy bonito restaurant,la comida fresca y deliciosa.la atencion epcesional.es un lugar pequeño con una muy gran categoria,los precios son modicos para todos,una gran variedad de estas delicias q es el mundo del sushi.se los recomiendo 100%.nosotros quedamos encantados y con deseos de regresar,eso seguro.betty y rosell"}
{"text":"It's good, nice to have a sushi place on this side of town and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Stepping into this place, I already felt a very chill and relaxing atmosphere. The waiters greeted us at the entrance very kindly with a smile on their face. They sat us down and gave us the menu, which contained dozens of items to choose from. They constantly checked up on us to make sure everything was perfect and were very patient for we are very picky with our food (my girlfriend is a vegan). I could tell in a short period of time they are really trying their best to be a successful and courteous restaurant while only being open for about a month. It is understandable that they had a waitress on her training day, but man was she great! Now, the food! It was amazing, every single bite of it, from the appetizers to the special rolls and deep fried rolls, we absolutely loved it; they even made a special roll just for my girlfriend to fit her vegan needs.   Overall food was amazing and some of the best shrimp tempura and agedashi tofu I and my little party have ever tasted! Service was astonishing and couldn't have asked for any better. Definitely coming back for more in the near future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. The server was really attentive and really friendly. The all you can eat is great because they give you an hour and a half vs the hour that they give you at a regular AYCE. It's a great little break from all the Mexican food in the area. Will definitely be going back soon"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and looking for something to eat. Sushi is kind of a default \"good enough\" for me, and sushirio had good reviews so I headed over.  The spot isn't too big, but service was quick. I sat at the bar and did the all you can eat (dinner version since you get better stuff than the lunch version). I just had the sushi chefs pick whatever they wanted and was pretty dang happy.  Some of the options were a little sauce heavy, but most were light and fresh like sushi should be.   One dish that was memorable was the \"Hawaiian style poke\" they served, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't \"Hawaiian\" any more than pineapple on pizza is. I chuckled to my self as I ate the ahi with futikake, onion, and shoyu and moved on to the next plate. They even have uni on the menu, which was pretty good.  Finished up with some mochi ice cream and overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was satisfied with my meal. My friend and I got the I love my ass roll, volcano roll, and Chirashi bowl that came with soup and salad, and also the lemon salmon nigiri. The lemon salmon nigiri was delicious and melts in your mouth. It came with avocado on top as well. The chirashi bowl was alright. Some of the fish wasn't fresh and I would like it to be but I did like the masago on it. I ate it with the rice. The I love my ass roll and volcano roll was really good though. I loved both of those rolls. Our server was friendly and provided excellent service. She was great. Overall everything was very delicious but we will stick to rolls and nigiri here next time we come back."}
{"text":"This is a  great  place that  I  found  on accident!  I love  little gems like this..  Great service..  Fast food serve times  The bathroom is CLEANNN!  &  has a changing table for baby  They has  good music  playing  AND THE PRICES ARE  AWESOME!  Mariel ( the waitress) is so nice  Finally a place that serves FRESH food that  taste great on my side of  town! Yum! Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great and the servers are awesome.  This is definitely my new fav sushi place."}
{"text":"This is my new  hangout, fresh fish, great service and friendly manager/owner make it the complete package. This is a place to take family or friends. 200% satisfied. Out sever Mariel is amazing and attentive."}
{"text":"GEM  !! I didn't order AYCE this time because I was trying it out for the first time today. I ordered simple rolls but my absolute favorite was the Spicy spider Roll! That one is in the crunchy roll section for $6 a roll. So cheap and amazing. I usually stop by a grocery store to get a role for a simple craving but never again.   Wonderful service from waitress Mariel and fast & delicious service from the sushi chef!   I noted their Bento box is $9.95 for a whole lot of items. I'll probably get that for my kids.  Definitely impressed with the flavor of the sushi! I'm trying the garlic tuna Nigiri  next! It's only 2pc for $3.  Come on! Rolls starting at $4!  I'm glad I came in. I'm guilty of judging them by the location."}
{"text":"Go in here for strip quality sush. Chef has worked the strip and now does an amazing family thing here. A great atmosphere and everyone is trained there to help make the night special for you. Spend your money with this local family and skip the headache and prices of the strip. Thanks again for bringing great sushi to my side of town finally!"}
{"text":"Food quality was amazing! It was some of the best yellow tail I have ever tasted!  Service was absolutely horrible. Definitely more training with staff on knowing your product and they need a better system to communicate to the chefs. Rolls took far too long to be ready, rolls were forgotten, and rolls were given that were not ours. There was o my 1 server on a Saturday night. Not smart. Manager was running around I wish he touched base more and should have given us a discount for the lack of service.  I would come back in a couple months to hope it improved because the food itself was delicious."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent, service was good. It had many good qualities, but it wasn't a \"great\" experience that would make me come back. There were only 3 dessert options, some rolls you can only order once. I personally HATE when my sushi is drowning in so much yum yum and eel sauce. So i usually ask for them to put less than normal, im glad they did. Even so my sushi was a bit soggy. So i tried to order only nigiri and certain rolls. Their Korean BBQ however was A+++!! It is a Korean owned Sushi restaurant. choice of Soju and Sake and draft beer was available. Like I have stated I liked it, I didn't love it. But please give it a go. you might find this your perfect joint."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to my old neighborhood that I grew up in. Good old north Las Vegas. .. many things and places have come and go. But behold an actual sushi bar \" ayce \" in this neighborhood. I'm adventurous and like to experience food and restaurants. No matter where I go or live.  Sushiro have very nice and attentive servers and the food was good. It's small and comfortable. Just my style. I had a great experience. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I always come here and it's the best sushi place tbh. The sushi taste great I'd rate everything a 8-10 nothing less and the atmosphere is so chill. The waitresses are always super nice and the owner is very friendly ! My favorite things to order are the green muscles, screaming orgasm, and the shrimp tempura crunch roll. It's bomb af  the only thing I wish they had is bobba but hopefully they'll add it to their menu soon!  And those prices can't be beat it's so cheap for sushi!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and food after trying it on a whim.  Would recommend for a casual date night off the strip."}
{"text":"While we are not sushi experts, we felt we had a fantastic meal.  We started with 4 different tempura apps. Especially liked the calamari with spicy sauce.  We then ordered #1 sushi boat for $39.99.  This started with a not so flavorful miso soup followed by a very fresh salad with ginger dressing. Then cam the 12 pieces of sashimi followed by the 4 rolls about 10 minutes.  There was really nothing we did not like except was not a fan of the soup. The 3 of us could not finish the rolls and took home about 10 pieces.  The guys took advantage of buy 2 get 1 free beer. So it was 3 beers for $8.  Our server was Destiny and she answered all our questions and made sure everything was to our satisfaction along with removing plates.  We we here based on yelp reviews and we're not let down,by fellow yelpers. One thing is they no longer offer the bent box's.  For $10 they were a great deal.  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in on a Tuesday and opted for a la carte. We ordered I love my ass roll, volcano roll, lemon salmon nigiri and a chirashi bowl. Really No complaints. Everything was amazing. Volcano roll and lemon salmon nigiri practically melts in your mouth. The torched white tuna on top of the I love my ass roll was delicious and the chirashi bowl was fresh as well. Our server was very attentive and followed up on us regularly."}
