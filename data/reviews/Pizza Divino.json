{"text":"Friendly staff I was just a little bit out of the area and they still deliver to me the pizza had Great crust lots of toppings and a great price fantastic place I will certainly be ordering again"}
{"text":"Great pizza and food and very nice and friendly as well I recommend this place if you want some good pizza"}
{"text":"This place is great and local. Real pizza at a good price. I have ordered the largest pizza and it was a hit for the party. I also enjoy coming for a simple slice. The wings are great too. All round a great place. The people are wonderful here. Service really makes a place for me. This is definitely a place to eat at."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The only thing I can say I didn't like was the amount of sauce- I feel like the pizza could have used more sauce. But I like extra sauce so I should have ordered extra sauce! Customer service was great and everybody loved the pizza!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. We ordered the philly steak, chicken parm, and chicken cutlet. Everyone was happy. Also some chicken strips. No complaints. People working were really cool. All for about $30 dollars. So not more expensive than any other fast food. They also had a pretty wide selection of beers. Cool place. They had that fast and furious movie playing on the tv, the one with Eva mendes. That booty tho."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place zero stars I would...placed an order ONLINE at 8:53PM that was due in 45-60 minutes...called at 10:29PM to be put on hold and then transferred to the extra rude girl Alisha who told me \"yah it didn't get printed off and we are closed so yah you can have a refund.\" I said you are going to have to do better than a refund and she said refund is done and hung up. WOW. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE. When I called back to ask to speak to the manager- Alisha and her little coworker were laughing and making jokes that they were calling the cops on me because I yelled.... really????? She proceeded to tell me she was putting me on speaker phone and gave the phone to her male friend while YELLING in the background. You might want to rethink placing an order, they will take your money, not deliver and threaten with the police."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza restaurants out there. Super fast delivery, amazing food, and great prices. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome and great food, totally worth checking out. 
The location seems totally like a hole in the wall, but the inside is clean and the food is fresh. they have a great egg roll also. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars, I would. The wings were tough and dried out. All the sauce had run out of the box and into the plastic delivery bag. What a mess! Onion rings were greasy and cold.  Salad was edible (hard to totally screw up a salad). I threw away all but the salad. Sad!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, good pizza.  BIG New York style slices with lots of flavor.  The toppings are the right amount, not too much, not too little.  The crisp-chewy crust is done just right.  It makes for some great garlic cheese bread.  
The location is easy to get into and out of.  Their store is small so recommend dine-in for couples or small groups only.  They do offer take-out though.   
Best pizza we've had since moving here.  Will definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place. Never again! I ordered a large thin crust pizza and 6 med wings. Pizza had big, black burnt bubbles on top, along with burnt pepperoni. Wings were okay.. Very long delivery time. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"I tried Pizza Divino for the first time today and I was impressed! The staff was extremely friendly and the food was great! The cost wasn't so bad either! I highly recommend trying out Pizza Divino!"}
{"text":"If you love thin New York style pizza with lots of flavor this is the place for you! The pepperoni here tastes so much better than other pizza joints! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Everything we got was soooooo good! Even when we reheated the leftovers the next day. Bambino special is a steal for what you get, $18 for large 1 topping pizza 12 wings and a 2 liter! Sign me up!"}
{"text":"Value lunch deal...  the slices are huge.

Ate here today with a friend.  Pretty cheap pizza slice with two toppings...  I've eaten at pizza places that have cost 2x as much that left me hungry...this wasn't one of them.

Definitely would go back.

There are only a few tables, so not a great place for a group to dine in.  The size of pizzas though would be great for carryout/delivery."}
{"text":"Dudes, you let us down. All the air went out of the balloon big time. 
I have eaten here on more than a few occasions and   had orders delivered many times. This last order that was delivered was cold, disgusting and horrible to say the least. Both the pizza AND the wings were not over cooked - they were severely burnt, so much so that they were inedible for our family. 
The wings disintegrated into dust when we tried our first one and the pizza had only the burnt taste to it. The pizza was as hard as peanut brittle upon opening the box after the delivery driver hands it over saying \"sorry for how long it took\" - we now know why, they took the extra time to burn the hell out of our food. 
Got to give credit to Yelp though - even though this restaurant was closed by the time I called, Yelp stepped up and really handled this wonderfully. I registered my complaint, sent the obligatory photos and Yelp made sure we received our refund along with many apologies. Thank you Yelp.
As for this establishment, yes I understand that thins happen from time to time, but to allow product like this to go out your door and onto a customers dinner table is very hard to comprehend.
We probably will visit your place of business once again, probably once the taste of the horrible food that was delivered is out of mouths. This was unacceptable but we do believe in second chances sincerely. Thank you ladies and gentlemen."}
{"text":"Tried this place friday on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised.  The pizza had an great flavor,  good ratio for cheese to sauce and the dough was chewy.  We will definitely be ordering from here again.  Wish they had made salads but the wings were ok."}
{"text":"We ordered the gigantic 28\" half Maui Waui half pepperoni  and had to try the the cannoli too so we got a caramel cannoli and a strawberry one. Holy pizza for days! It was delicious! Just the right amount of chewiness and crispness to the crust and plenty of cheese! The cannoli were crispy and sweet deliciousness as well. Only reason it gets 4 stars is that I couldn't fit the left overs in the fridge! Lol! I guess next time we just need more people to help us eat it! Great value too!"}
{"text":"I lose a bet with my coworkers so I had to buy them lunch and they decided on pizza   I decided to try this place and wow 2 pizzas, mozzarella sticks and 2 cannolis for $25. The pizzas were excellent and so was the cannoli. The mozzarella sticks were meh but I'm really picky about mozzarella sticks. Service was amazing and they got my order done pretty quickly."}
{"text":"One star for now. Wanted pizza by the slice, as advertised on their website, menu, and neon sign. Don't sell it on weekends."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!!! I was very hesitant about this place especially because of the location, but I was beyond impressed. Took a while to get the food, but the wait was so worth it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was Great! Wanted to try something new I usually get Dominos or Pizza Hut but I think I just found my new Pizza spot. If you want to eat pizza but tired of the same oh same oh you should try it. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Ordered food through yelp at 7:34 got my delivery confirmation time for 8:33. Money came right out of account. Called them at 8:37 to ask about order and they said they just got the order and it would be a while for delivery. I asked for manager and Brandon came on line and sounded annoyed. He said the order was in and it would be another 30 min.  I ordered chicken wings and sandwich.  He didn't offer a discount or even a coupon.  All their bad reviews are because delivery time sucks! Maybe manager Brandon needs to find out why there is an issue and fix it! Order arrived at 9:12. ***update.  I contacted yelp and they told me they delivered my order within a minute of me placing it!"}
{"text":"First time ordering through Yelp and my food was delivered within 30 minutes of them opening as promised!! The food was hot and fresh.  The pizza tastes amazing and the combination of the crust, sauce, cheese and spices on top made for an awesome lunch! I like my pizza thin and greasy...once again they delivered!  The hot wings were cooked to perfection and the sauce was just the way it should be!  Last, but not least, when I called to check on my order the customer service was on point and the delivery driver was very courteous.  Thank you for a great first Yelp experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered a meatball sub and a pepperoni pizza. Both were really good. I specially enjoyed the meatball sub the sauce was spicy but not hot or too sweet."}
{"text":"A good tasting, well done meatball Parmesan sub, conventional but not rubbery hot wings. Anybody who tries to bring New York pizza to AZ is ok in my book. Place is small, 7 or 8 tables and typical mom and pop pizza shop ambiance. That's fine with me."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, for the first time I even ate the crust.
Absolutely Delicious.
I would recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good but they burned the bottom on half the pie. I'm still rating at 3 stars because the pizza that wasn't burned was really good. I'll be back to try it again"}
{"text":"I haven't received my food yet and it's been well over an hour. I called and was told it's being bagged now and I'll be the first delivery. Well that was over 10 min ago. They didn't apologize or anything. By the way it's Wednesday night and now my 5 yr old will not be able to go to bed at his normal time since we are still waiting to eat- I was told 45 min by the way!"}
{"text":"We love the pizza and wings from here!!  I crave it every week.  Ordering is easy, delivery is as promised, food is delish. What more could a customer want ??"}
{"text":"Gave me a 45 to 60 min delivery time.  Called them after an hour and was told it just got in the oven.  I got my order 1.5 hours after delivery just to be told they didnt have soda.  I was handed 2 one dollar bills at the door.  They had an hour and a half to let me know they werr out of diet soda so thar maybe i could pick somthing else.  This places service is a joke."}
{"text":"Delivery took more than an hour on we weekdayand no apology whatsoever. The food was okay"}
{"text":"TIP: order through website & NOT Grub Hub! The best desserts & the quickest delivery! Thank you!"}
{"text":"From Chicago, so I am very judgemental regarding my pizza. I ordered the carnivore with mushrooms. The toppings were plentiful, but nothing like Beggars pizza back home. Crust was ok closer to NY than Chicago, not much sauce. Only real complaint it was really greasy. Extra points for sprinkles of spices they added. Delivery took over an hour :,("}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to having a new good NY pizza place close to where we live. The reviews here on yelp enticed us to place orders. Let's just say our first order the onion rings they sent out were burnt. I mean really burnt. The sandwiches were cold. OK we figured it was the holidays let's give them a break because we realized it could be busy in there trying to get out of there themselves. 

So what do we do we give them a second opportunity to score a new customer. Guess what?  Nope. Well over an hour and a half no pizza. I called to cancel the order and got hung up on."}
{"text":"When I saw they have a 28\" New York Style pizza, my friends and I had to try it. When I opened the door to the glorious sight of seeing a delivery guy holding this ginormous box of cheese & pepperoni goodness, I laughed. It wouldn't even fit through my front door without being tilted. Haha!

Once we set it on the stove top and realized the box was even bigger than my stove top, we could not stop laughing! But then we opened the box.... A moment of silence came over us... Then our mouths dropped and we starred at this magnificent sight of holy amazingness... Still maintaining the silence... Drool was starting to run off our lips...

Then like a pack of ferocious wild animals, we dived in and grabbed the largest slice of heaven we get our hands on. This pizza is definitely a two hander. And all for under $30???????

Pizza Divino has me sold!!!! True NY style pizza!! It was delish!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, they will deliver to your hotel, and they'll be snappy about it. I mean, that's a really specific piece of advice for anyone reading right now, but I imagine delivery in general is an important consideration. But when you're worn out from a hike and they bring it to the door of your hotel, you're even more appreciative.

The pizza was affordable, wasn't too fancy, and sits right in the middle of the road between thin and thick crust. We also ordered a salad, which wasn't much to write home about but it did the trick to offset the pizza-ness.

I really appreciate being able to order right from the Yelp app, and that you can make a half/half pizza right there on the app as well. It was also a Yelp Cash Back restaurant, so that's another bonus. 

Honestly, when convenience is the name of the game, I can't imagine something more smooth."}
{"text":"Okay... another check in. There is no doubt this is one of my \"go to\" places to eat and I will continue to go back! On this visit I asked for a giant slice with extra sauce on top! In my previous reviews I already noted that the pizza is excellent! Awesome crust, awesome cheese, and an amazing sauce. Also worthy of noting that they are consistent... it's always awesome!

I know it's weird. Lol I thought of asking for extra sauce on top because there is a place in Brooklyn I used to go to all the time called L & B Spumoni Gardens. I know extra sauce is a boring for a pizza topping but let me tell you it was delicious!!!!!! Mmmmm!! Mmmm!! Even this photo makes my mouth water!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza. We enjoyed the laid back place. It is not a big restaurant by any means, but they treat you like you are a regular here so check it out for a great deal on a lot of food. Wings were ok, I have had better, but my son killed 11 of them. We enjoyed our visit and as I said, great pizza for a great price. Hard to beat this value for dinner out."}
{"text":"We love ordering pizza from here!! It's fun to call ahead and take it home . We have ordered pizza for birthday parties and everyone loved it . The guys that work here are always so nice . It makes me feel like I'm in New York eating pizza!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered two xtra large pizzas and some wings. Was told to give them 30 minutes, I showed up in 30 minutes and it was ready. Tiny place with a couple tables. Clean. Only advice..be a little more friendly and welcoming when customers walk through the door."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Delicious food. Their gigantic pizza slice is the best! Their sandwiches are the best in town!! Don't let this lil place fool you, It's for sure a lil hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Really good NY style pizza. We got a half pepperoni half sausage as well as an order of the garlic cheese bread and both were great but I'd have to say the crust was my favorite part of both (which says a lot because these are usually the pieces we toss aside!). Prices are far more reasonable than chain pizza places for far better quality. Delivery was also exceptionally fast and the staff was extremely helpful and nice. We're super stoked to have a great pizza joint in our neighborhood.

Unrelated but I'm not sure why two reviews were necessary for the 'metal mishap?' All new businesses make mistakes/learn along the way and I'm sure this was a one off miss. No need to destroy their rep on Yelp right out the door. Don't let one bad review stop you from trying this place and supporting small business in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I wanna like this place more. Fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. But the delivery times are sooo bad. Worst I've ever experienced anywhere. They are always and forever late. And for the life of me, I can't understand why they can't keep up. Every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. I've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! How is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? Fix it!"}
{"text":"Bought a coupon from restaurant .com for this place taking a chance as I had never been there. This place was delicious!  We had pizza and wings and hands down best pizza in AZ. This is a family owned joint with only 4 employees dedicated to their business.  I met the owner he was the one who made our food. Nice guy! I recommend that u check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza in Phoenix! And it's cheap! 8.99 for a 14\" yes please! 
The sandwiches and fries are delicious and the mozzarella sticks are the best I've ever had!!! 
 They deliver in a  timely manner and are always friendly. We have yet to be let down.
The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they charge you a $1.25 \"online fee\" if you order on the website and they close way to early, besides those two minor issues this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, friendly service. These guys know what it means to be a good authentic Italian place. Pizza and sandwiches are the focus but they have some good sides/desserts too. Will
Be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Ignore the bad reviews.  Unbeatable for the price.  Feed your family cheap or pig out with their amazing large sized pizza/wing/soda combos. This pizza is NYC style and fantastic.  The wings were cooked and sauced to perfection.  We had the medium spicy sauce and it was perfect.  No morning heartburn either.  The cheese on the pizza is high quality, perfectly sauced, and toppings are rather generous.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"So delicious!! We decided to try them and got the cheese pizza with half pepperoni and olives and the crust was so good. Cooked perfectly! The cheese bread is bomb too!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Pizza Divinio and I Got the giant 28 inch pizza for my sons birthday tonight along with some wings. They were busy so it took about 45 minutes for my pickup order but it was worth the wait. The pizza is HUGE! Filled up the entire back of my SUV. The crust was crispy and charred just the way I like it. The wings were crisp and not overly saucy. The medium sauce was flavorful and had the perfect amount of spice. We will definitely be back.... after we can get through all the leftover pizza!!"}
{"text":"I guess being from Chicago I am a pizza snob. I wanted this pace to be good because it 2 mins from my house however, nothing but bad cheap.pizza. When the sausage tastes like mystery meat yu know there is a problem. Nothing home made here, all out of the freezer or a box. Someone stated they had the best cheese sticks ever, really? The best frozen deep fried cheese sticks? Much better options."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. We got a cheese pizza and a supreme pizza  it tasted like school food. It was really disappointing:("}
{"text":"Cozy little whole in the wall... Wonderful canzone and Philly cheese steak sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their pizza is my family's favorite. They make adjustments for the kids (light sauce) and are great at customer service. We always order it for delivery and it is fast and delivered hot every time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I'm in love with their steak subs and wings. If I could I would eat them everyday Lol.Seriously recommend this place to anyone looking to eat some good food."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza 12 wings and cannoli on Monday with the coupon featured on Yelp @ 25% off .  The food was very good and what a bargain!  The pizza had great flavor, plenty of cheese, and savory toppings.  I live a block away so I will definitely be back soon to try more items."}
{"text":"What a cute hidden hole in the wall! I went after dark and it's in a strip mall that is otherwise closed. Parking was great. Service was fast and friendly, Had a delicious Philly cheese steak sandwich and half is going to be lunch today. Can't wait to try different kinds of pizza. The delivery girl was kept busy."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza place today for the first time. I was very surprised how great the food was for the price. Great value. The pizza was phenomenal as well as the extra crispy wing I ordered. I recommend it and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Finally found our new pizza/wing place!!!  After our old delivery spot changed their wing recipe & ruined a good thing, we've been trying new places & this one is gonna be it.  They have easy online ordering, which I love, the salad wasn't as nicely done as some other places, but that wasn't & never is a high priority....what is, is the pizza/wing combo of finding a place where both are equally great.  Their pizza is very large, thin crust, perfect texture to the crust & the cheese, pepperoni & seasonings were delicious.  Wings were great too....very much enjoyed it all...this is the place now!"}
{"text":"I walked in, wasn't greeted. The employee behind the counter was on his personal phone. Stood in front of him waiting for him to take my order but he didn't. He stayed on his phone. So I sat down and waited for another 5 mins and just decided to leave. This is by far the worst service I've had."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wings at a good price. They have the party pizza which is a HUGE pizza that's great for parties. I haven't really tried anything else except for the pizza but they do carry sandwiches and other things. For dessert you can't go wrong with the cheesecake or cannoli."}
{"text":"Good solid food. 
Fast delivery. 
Ordered onion rings, which were crispy and warm.
Pizza was a little heavy on cheese, but still quite good and flavorful."}
{"text":"The owner did not send a message to me, but to my boyfriend regarding our pizza snafu, so I am updating my review. If I recall though the name of the owner IS the person I discussed the issue with,  but whatever. The crust is fantastic, the sauce could have more flavor but it is definitely better than other \"ny\" pizza shops...I am from the east coast and it has been a long time since I have had such a comparable pizza crust. Seriously fantastic. The wings were decent and mozzarella sticks were frozen but not bad, and prices are very reasonable. I am not ready to go back to pizza divino soon, but might at some point to try their subs. Hopefully this was a learning experience for the owner and their employees.  I certainly am not trying to take down their business by any means, and never would have posted anything in my review about the metal had the situation been handled properly. Still, what happened is NOT good. I am thankful because it could've been much worse. It was the fact that it was blown off like it was no big deal and that is just wrong.  Of course it takes time to work out the kinks and get things running smoothly when opening a new business, which *in addition to good food,  makes quality control and great customer service extremely important when it comes to success. Hopefully they are around for a long time and get better with time so that when and if we go back,  they earn regular customers."}
{"text":"Maybe I've just been unlucky with this place but the past two times I've been there have been pretty subpar. I heard about this place from a family member and knew I had to try it- being from New York, good pizza is far and few to come by in Phoenix. I went there on a Friday night at 6pm with my nieces and mom and they had one slice of pizza left and weren't making any more. Then I decided to give them a try again and my mom ordered a ham and cheese calzone and opened it up and there was about 1 slice of ham in there and a drizzle of cheese. The pizza and wings were burnt and bone dry and my calzone was really crispy. We're not hard to please but this was pretty bad."}
{"text":"First time visit today.  I was doing the yummy after each bite.  Seasoning was more than expected.  Perfect thickness.  loved the pricing compared to where I have been going for 4 yrs...no more Papa Johns for me!  Not stingy with toppings. Thanks Mark for the good service.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place on the north side. The pizza is amazing. The crust is a bit crunchy which makes the pizza better, not soggy, usually other pizza places have their pizza soaked in grease including their crust. You get your money's worth and more with the calzone and they make the best cannolis I have ever had. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend, always like trying local spots. This place disappointed in every aspect. A 45 min delivery time led to over 90 min wait. The food was cold and below average. We ordered pizza, wings, mozzarella sticks and fries. Would never try this place again. The only positive thing I could say is the gentleman that answered the phone all 3 times I had to call cause of the late delivery, was nice."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had since I moved close to this place. Amazing crust. Fresh taste. Hands down the best pizza I've had in years. Fast and friendly service. Would definitely recommend to any pizza lovers out there."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings! Try their new place on 35th Avenue and Greenway. Beautiful location with lots a room for groups. They have adult beverages and their prices are amazingly affordable. The wings are cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Ordered 18 in pizza, half sausage, half pepperoni, pizza was fantastic.  No shortage of toppings on pizza. Being from NY, I am really picky about my pizza. Pizza tasted like it came from New York. Which is great because I can't stand pizzas that come from franchises those pizzas all taste like cheese and sauce on a cracker. Also picked up a cannoli while I was there it was delicious fantastic just like I remember from the Italian bakeries back east. Will definitely only go to this place for my pizzas and my cannolis."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the prices are even better. This is the kind of pizza spot people look for. I'd order it to-go because the spot is pretty small,  and really, honestly....you can't beat the quality of their pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"OMG This pizza as amazing it was hot...like still steaming hot it was here in less then 30 min and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Don't know there aren't more reviews but this is a must have!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome deli type sandwiches and their chicken tenders are yummy too! 

Only giving 4/5 stars because delivery boy came off a little weird.

I can't believe we've never ordered from here, will be again soon"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. Order the huge pizza for special occasions and our guest love the food. Good prices for a lot of food."}
{"text":"if you have store hours saying your open  on your door that's locked be ready for a 1 star review. We drove over here to try out the pizza and the hours everywhere say it's open. it's a lie. we will not return to a place that can not even get the store hours correct. it's 1250 on a Sunday hours day 10 am to 10pm. My suggestion is to always call ahead from now on."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wings, delivery was pretty fast. Extremely greasy, so if you're one of those people that dab the greases off your pizza instead of indulging in its glory, it might not be the place for you"}
{"text":"Tasty Pizza.  The Sub was not skimpy and boy was it delicious.  The mozzarella sticks were just ok for me.  Definitely recommend over Dominos and Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I added a soda to my order to get my total to $15 and the delivery guy didn't even bring the soda. So i basically got ripped off... Then my sandwich wasn't made properly. No onions or mayo. Will definitely let the hotel I'm staying at know not to recommend this place."}
{"text":"My 200th review!

I ended up here because of a post on 9Gag of all places. Ordered some mozzarella sticks and a large pizza. The mozzarella and sauce were great, I would have been happy with a double order of those by themselves. The pizza was pretty good. I really liked the crust and they are very generous with the cheese. There is nothing better than grabbing a slice of pizza and having cheese stretch everywhere. It was a little heavy on the seasoning, but other than that it was good. I'd like to go back and try their calzones sometime and maybe a cannoli."}
{"text":"Pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. They don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  I don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. Our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered."}
{"text":"The good: It's inexpensive, and the crust is good.  Not great, but good.  

The bad:  The ingredients are meh.  The sauce is bland and a little bitter.  Not spicy, zesty or savory at all.  All the toppings were kind of lumped in one or two places and not spread around the pie. 

+Before readung further, please know that the owner replied to my review with a sincere attempt to resolve this and explained that he was unaware of the issue at the time.  Kudos for that.  I'm leaving the original review as-is because it was my experience, but I did update the stars based on Brandon's response.  Brandon's response was what we had hoped for at the time.  Not a free pizza (tho Brandon did offer that, too) but just a simple and sincere apology.  Thanks Brandon for caring about your customers. 

The 'X' factor: As soon as I opened the box after bringing the pizza home (the delivery guy hadn't shown up that night), I noticed a shard of metal on a pepperoni.   We inspected the rest of our food and it looked fine, so we ate it since the kids were starving, and called afterwards to tell this new place how the meal was and explained about the metal on the pizza.  The guy did muster an apology, and although we weren't looking for a handout of any sort since we DID eat the pizza, it still would have been nice to offer any sort of solution besides a half-hearted and insincere apology.  We won't be back basically because of the response.  Mistakes happen, but you need to address them appropriately. Sorry guys, this place us not for us.  Best of luck to you.

I am uploading the pic I took of the metal.  It looks like the tip of a knife or the corner of a spatula. 

P.S.  there was no other metal in the food, so it was a one-off mistake I think.  Still..."}
{"text":"The young lady that took my order was very friendly and it was delivered very quickly by a clean cut friendly driver.  I had high hopes for the pizza, but sadly it fell short.  The crust is what I expect of a New York pie, nice and crispy with a chewy interior.  I was disappointed with the cheese and sauce, the cheese lacked salt and the seasoning of the sauce was non existent.  It also could have benefited from another couple minutes in the oven.  Overall it's a good pizza, by no means great.  I prefer to buy from local joints as opposed to a chain so I'll probably order from them again, I just won't be excited about it."}
{"text":"Although this is a little spot their food is a big deal! Never have I ordered from this place and then I'm satisfied I highly recommend it surprise amazing as well as their sandwiches and appetizers definitely worth the drive now offering delivery still excited! Keep up the good work I'm from New York in the piece of something to talk about best pizza this side of town"}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited this long to finally try it!  Great pizza!  Stopped in for a slice and a drink and left full, which is impressive since I'm usually a big eater.  Took a pastrami sandy and fries back home to the wife.  Tons of fries.  Pastrami looks and smells great and the wife loves it.  I think we found a winner!"}
{"text":"Ordered two deliver pizzas and by the third slice we had to throw them away. Each slice had long hairs baked within the pizza. I called the place up and spoke to someone who claimed to be the manager who claimed their name was Ramone. He said he wasn't there when the order was made (which I don't believe seeing that I don't think he just got into the restaurant seconds after this was delivered to us) and that he offered to remake the order. I declined this because the three slices we had all had hairs in the crust and he didn't believe me. He did not offer a refund and said he couldn't so I'm not a fan of putting someone on blast but let my picture speak for itself. Notice the long hair in the middle of the edge of the crust and the small one towards the tip? Yuck! I believe they do not use hair caps here."}
