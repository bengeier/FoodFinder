{"text":"Beauty lies from within.  Starboard Tack isn't your glitzy Vegas strip establishment or your artsy downtown eclectic gathering spot, but it will be your go-to hangout for great cocktails.  The dive bar style setting is no indication of the quality that this place has to offer.  Led by two of Las Vegas' finest mixologists, the cocktails are simply spot on.  While rum is the spirit of choice, the Retroscena influence comes through with ample amaro additions to many of the signature cocktails.  From light to rich, the cocktail creations of these two genius bartenders will once again be the talk of the town.  Oh, by the way, the food was surprisingly delicious.  While the Thai mussels, oysters, and chicken skewers were quite tasty, the Mongolian cheese steak sandwich was an incredible mix of spice and texture, worthy of visit on its own.  Needless to say, I'll be back...often."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see this place open again. I was invited by a regular there and man, was I pleased! I ordered some tapas (I'm a huge tapas fan) and found the empanadas to be excellent. They were Philippine empanadas, which are a little different from the ones I'm used to from South America. I took my mom there for lunch and she loved them. She's from Chile, so the bar is high. I also had the mussels, which were ridiculously large and delicious! The beer selection is good, the atmosphere about what you want for a bar/restaurant (dark, quiet). I hope this place stays around, because in that area, you never know, and I'm there a lot."}
{"text":"Love it! Fun drinks and a surprisingly delicious menu for what is essentially a bar.  The date and I split three apps - Tuna Poke Bowl, Empanadas, and Coconut Shrimp. All three were really good.   Friendly bar staff, and easy-going clientele.  We will return soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vibe of this place! It felt cozy and comfortable - a nice relief from the craziness of the strip. I didn't get any of the food, but the drinks I got were perfectly made. I recommend the Hong Kong Yacht Club and the Starboard Taquiri."}
{"text":"Third night in a row i've been here. great service every time. the food is so good!!!!! decently priced. i can vouch for the burger, the cheesesteak(!!!!!!really good!!!)) the wings , the chicken tempura, and the fish and chips are the best i've had in vegas. and of course the nautical theme is the best. also the fries on all the dishes were good. the cocktails are all tasty. yep this the new hang out"}
{"text":"Love this place. Bartenders are attentive and friendly. The entire menu is delicious. I come for the empanadas, mussels, and cheesesteak. Everything is priced well. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Starboard is a hidden gem!  I love the cocktail and beer menu and the food is something special!"}
{"text":"Great bar off the strip in the Winchester area! Good drinks, bartenders made a good Old Fashoined, the lady had a Swizzle. Food is surprisingly good. Has a great 70s Regal Beagle vibe. A few TVs to watch you fav sports. Definitely a place I will frequent again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always a great spot for a fabulous Tiki inspired cocktail, or a late-night bite... I suppose anytime bite. The atmosphere is fun and welcoming,  with an old Vegas vibe. When the new owners took over Gilligan's Hideaway, they remodeled this place after the previous spot which was originally called starboard tack. I highly recommend the drink that you get out of the panda, it's fun it's interesting and oh so tasty. I also highly recommend the fried chicken fried rice. So good I can't even."}
{"text":"Chicken wings were too salty and look at the color! My gosh how can I eat this?  I ordered thru uber eats app and the star rating was 4, not accurate at all!"}
{"text":"This a great new, old bar. It is bartender owned, as in the guys that own it were and are bartenders in Vegas. It's really becoming a big industry hang out, they take care of their people. They make craft cocktails, but don't get snootie if you just want a Coors light and a shot of whiskey. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"This our go-to bar. Going out to dinner? Let's grab a drink or two beforehand at Starboard. Coming home from dinner? Let's grab another drink or two... or three. BTW, you can afford to do that here, almost all of their cocktails are $8. Still think that's too expensive, well then you are obviously not from Vegas so trust me, that's a good deal. Especially with the quality drinks they sling here.   Also, fun fact, this place is open 24/7 and the kitchen is open 24/7. I don't know about you, but I keep a mental list of places that serve delicious bar food all hours of the day, don't you?   This place is divey, but has a very subtle tiki vibe that I love. Which, if you have read some of my other reviews or noticed my frequent checking in at tiki bars, that won't surprise you in the slightest. Just keep in mind, while you mostly get bartenders who are friendly, eager to serve and have that amazing Vegas hospitality, you may get a few classic dive bar attitudes. Don't fret though, your drinks will still be amazing. The consistency here is on point.  So, I'm gonna say it. Favorite bar in Vegas. WHAT. Yeah I did it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, I've been here twice already and I can't wait to come back. The fried chicken fried rice is great. The bartenders will help you find a drink to fit your tastes...and they're all delicious. The Chi Chi, Gunpowder, and Marinero are especially awesome."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Starboard Tack since their official opening. The food is on point! Our group shared the Thai Curry Mussels and the oysters. The oysters were a highlight and very fresh tasting. I had a burger with fries which was also very good. They have a wide selection of beer but I haven't made my way through the cocktail menu yet! This a very unique bar for the area and I look forward to coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love this bar! The food is amazing, the drinks are fun, and the renovations are beautiful. Highly recommend checking it out, it's a little hidden off the strip gem."}
{"text":"Coolest cocktails in vegas! CJ and Lyle both former Velveteen Rabbit Bartenders are now mixing up the most exotic and tasty cocktails in Vegas at Starboard Tack! The place is a throwback to the 70's nautical themed dive bar but don't let that scare you! The vibe here is chill, the drinks are crazy good and so is the food!"}
{"text":"We had originally been here when it was Gillian's hideaway.  The food wasn't bad then but it's even better now.  Significantly smaller menu. Half drinks.  Half food.  Smokey interior as it is primarily a bar. No one under 21 allowed. Love how have their own take on everything. Specialty but from local bakery for burgers.  And beef from the local butcher.   Cocktails are a bit small for the price bus definitely a fun selection.  If you like quiet low key dive bars.  Try it!!!"}
{"text":"First eve bad p  First ever bad review. Worst place ive been in Vegas- and I am A local and work In The service industry which means I'll tolerate almst anything. The bartender was the rudest I have ever incounterd and I am a really polite person and I make an effort to be a decent client.  Hunteudge tavern is near by and it is a much better bar. And if you need food there is a Tacos El Gordo near by"}
{"text":"Gunpowder Swizzle best cocktail ever!!!  This drink is truly refreshing, yummy and the right zing! Never had anything like it!  Amazing and very friendly bartenders and the food...the food... Mussels, skewers, longaniza empanadas, poke... Every item in the menu has a unique and vibrant and yummy taste!  Congrats Bryant and Lyle!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. It's really tucked away and then even hidden some more from the deceptive exterior. But, the inside was packed full of local bartenders and other industry workers. I would not recommend if you aren't part of this crew because this looks like a place that wouldn't think twice about curb stomping a stranger that wanders in trying to fit in. This is definitely an industry club and locals only.   There was a good mix of music during the time I was here. A good mix of people from all backgrounds. I mean, you might be able to get a drink if you know the secret handshake but if you guess it wrong, you better know high level jeet kune do. It seemed like the entire bar knew each other and I wouldn't be surprised if after a certain hour they all turn into vampires."}
{"text":"Cool little place..... just stopped by for a quick minute,  but we'll be back!! It's a little hideaway with ALOT is personality!! Steven was GREAT!!"}
{"text":"The skewers, like the owners, are hot and delicious pieces of meat  Great drinks and a better atmosphere. Also, grab a shirt, they feel great on the bod"}
{"text":"The oysters and the poke bowl are incredible. Incredible drinks, only surpassed by the service. I've never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"The drinks were great and so was the costumer service!   However... My friend and I got food poisoning from eating their raw oysters! We ordered 6, I got 3 and she got 3 as well.. I suggest taking that off the menu... the couple sitting next to us also ordered the raw oysters (12) and I'm wondering if they got sick too...   We both had to spend a night in the ER, those oysters are definitely a health hazard! I wonder how many people got sick by eating these.   The reason for my 3 stars is because of those oysters, please take them off your menu and do not serve this to anyone!   Like I said everything else was fantastic, just sucks that it had to ruin my 1st time there."}
{"text":"First time here, what an incredible experience! Had many great cocktails, the Cherry Blossom being my favorite. Tried the Beef Skewers, amazing! Full of flavor and juice. Can't wait to go back and try more! Thanks CJ for the awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We stopped here just after 10 am on our way out of Vegas.  I love tiki- it reminds me of my grandparents- and was very excited upon entering.  It's dark, but open.  Everything, from the lamps to the glasses to the wallpaper, was perfect.  Our bartender was great, too.  Every drink (I had three, my husband had two) was delicious and refreshing.  I'd got back to Vegas just to visit them again.  Even got a shirt for the road, hah!"}
{"text":"How do you give a dive bar 5 stars? Easy.  You serve killer cocktails, you hire great staff and you put out incredibly tasty food ranging from Monstrous Green Lip Mussels and Tom Kah Mushroom skewers to Mongolian spiced cheesesteak that will wish you had not agreed to split it. Oh and your 24 hours. I love this place."}
{"text":"Oh man am I glad my wife found this place! It's in a tucked away spot with a neighborhood feel inside. They will have gaming machines so it will be open 24 hrs and will be a smoking place. That's how I roll but maybe not for everyone. They have a real cool nautical Polynesian feel (not tiki) with really good drinks for an excellent price! We also ordered the Poke bowl and the tuna poke was fantastic! The tuna was as fresh as it gets and firm. The sauce was really well made and it was all over a bed of rice. Check out the menu - lots of things to try!  Parking seems ample and they have a big screen for watching sports. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm local and this is my absolute favorite place in Las Vegas! I have never used Shazam more in my life than here! The playlist is insanely good! I feel so at home and welcomed there! Everyone is beyond amazing and the food and drinks are outstanding! MUST GO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path lies a classic restaurant spot redone as one of the best local off strip bars. Original decor is still intact, award winning bartenders and good bar food. Ample private parking in a well lit lot.  If you are into retro design and crafted drinks Starboard Tack us the spot for you."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since my first review and I still love Starboard Tack. I've made my way through more of the menu now and absolutely everything is good (even the fried rice!). I really love the skewers, especially the beef and shrimp. My boyfriend loves the chicken sandwich. They have been doing more events and concerts recently and this place gets pleasantly packed during those. This is definitely the place to be whether you're looking for a social hangout on the weekends or a quiet bar to get some great food on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Nice to see a beach vibe bar on this side of town. I enjoyed the gunpowder shizzle, if only it was made in a bigger glass...I bought myself a shirt out of random because it was soft. I didn't have anything to eat but definitely will be coming back next time."}
{"text":"Great vibe that is unique to Vegas. We've been here a few times now and always have a great time whether we're eating dinner or playing keno or making our way through their cocktail list. The owners are super cool. Also, the toilet paper is soooo soft. My favorites are the skewers (all four kinds) and the Gunpowder Swizzle."}
{"text":"Seriously in love with this dive bar. The decor, food and choices of beer were excellent! Wish I tried their cocktails while I was there but it just gives me another excuse to come hang out here. Loved the poke, so good!! Even the rice flavorful! The owner was super nice and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my last day at work with my coworkers once we were off. Their cocktail list was pretty good-- a lot of rum based drinks though and not enough of a mix as far as vodka or gin cocktails go. I'm not sure what the place was before, but it feels like they haven't yet out what they want to be just yet. Dive bar? Tiki bar? Cafe? Poker machines with everyone smoking while you eat? The decor is a little strange too.   The bartender was friendly and paid plenty of attention to us and was constantly checking up, but started taking shots with us when we ordered a round. I always think that's weird. Annoyed that smoking is allowed even though you can order food and eat at the bar. Isn't that banned in Vegas?   The pork belly fried rice was the best thing I've tasted in a looooong time. I would come back just for that. But order it to go."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in town hands down. They have a really cool history and story - I won't go into detail on this review but it's fun to read about in the other reviews.   They have some amazing food you wouldn't expect from a late night bar! I love the fun cups the drinks come in as well. The decor is funky and totally nautical dude  All of the bartenders kick major ass.  CJ & Mia are who I usually see here, they're always on their game! Speaking of games... I feel every time I'm here one of my friends wins a decent amount of money on the machines. Super fun place you will be super pleased"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I had been before, but what a change. It still has the same charm and dim lighting, but a modern twist without being pretentious. I'm so glad we came in. We were just planning on a drink, but after seeing the menu we were curious. It was beyond my expectations. I will definitely be back even though we live on the other side of town, it's worth the trip. We ordered the chicken friend rice, poke and tempura fried chicken. I told Steven our amazing bartender not to change a thing, everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and us stopped by here for the first time last night. It is  interesting to learn the history of this bar. Starboard Tack opened in 1971 until 2000, when it became Gilligan's Hideaway until 2016. In early 2017, new owners restored the old concept, complete with menu that features pupu platters and skewers as well as Southeast Asian fare and Caribbean.  This is one of the best dive bar around imo. The places isn't as smoky as other bars I have been. There is a spacious bar area, dining area that is well lit with music not too loud and lounge area.  Must have are their Seasonal Chi Chi Frozen Drink that is served in a cute Panda mug and their original Lucky Cat is served on a cute Cat mug. We tried most of their drinks. They have a good selection of draft beer.  We like the Poke Bowl and all the skewers and the peanut sauce that came with it were flavorful. My bf and I's bill were $85 and the price were reasonable.  There were short on staff last night and their bartender Matthew waited on us. He was very friendly and attentive.  Such a great place, both the bar and kitchen are opened 24 hours, plus amazing hand crafted cocktails and food, with TVs and gaming. Definitely a place to bring your friends!"}
{"text":"We had a law school bar review here last night. The bartenders were all very nice, the food was yummy, and the price was fair. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were down for Viva Las Vegas, and happened upon this great, slightly out-of-the-way place one evening. It came up on a search in Google for \"Tiki drinks\" in Vegas, but in reality -- and true to it's roots, it appears -- this restaurant/bar is more nautically-themed than Tiki, with a smattering of fun Caribbean and Pacific-rim inspired food and drink offerings.  And what drink offerings they are ... clearly someone put a lot of thought into these. The Rum-Kum Cocktail was comprised of a rum blend with lime, dry curacao, with a whole kumquat garnish; the Starboard Taiquiri a fantastic daiquiri variant made with Plantation Pineapple rum, lime, sugar, and absinthe.  The Mocha Cioccolato Ya Ya is a decadent desert coffee drink spiked with Meleti Cioccolato, coffee rum, and with a coconut whipped cream float; the Poop-Poop-A-Doop another fine rum drink made with (besides the rum) gin, apricot brandy, and not-often-encountered Swedish Punsch. The Lucky Cat - an inventive blend of Kikori, Allspice Dram, and rice milk, with a hint of spice heat from Togarashi vanilla syrup, as also intriguing and delicious.  My favorite was the Atlantico on Atlantic St., a riff on the classic fizz cocktail made with Atlantico rum, creme de cassis, orgeat, lime, egg white, walnut bitters, and, as it developed in the mouth, a faint, smoky hint of scotch ... As beautiful to drink as it was to look at.  Despite their being uniformly excellent, the drinks were among the most reasonably priced we had during our whole week in Vegas, so our bill was a happy thing as well.  We had enjoyed dinner earlier in the evening, so did not get to explore the food menu as much as we might have liked, but the Vegetable Lumpia and Poke we shared were both fresh and tasty, and the service was prompt and friendly.  Starboard Tack wasn't very busy when we were there, but it surely deserves to be!"}
{"text":"Creative tiki-focused craft cocktails most of which are $8. For negroni week, they offered one made with durian infused Campari, which was perverse yet delightful. The eats are really reasonable and the pairing of spam with pimento cheese may be the apogee or nadir (depending on your pov) of hipster bar food. A must."}
{"text":"Two outta Towners introduced, to this amazing establishment, by one local, & we couldn't have been more satisfied. 24 oysters finished in less that 3 minutes. No joke. The tarragon mignonette was the best side sauce we've ever had on on oysters, & San Diego is one of our frequent stops. Finished the night off with the 4 skewers medley, & it was fabulous. We highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Let's be real here a vegas revive, a vegas landmark. This place just really did it right. 5 star stand up job. But let's not talk about appearance because they did an outstanding job. Let's talk about the food. The food is just some of the best, some of the best you can find all around the clock and I'd say all around town when not hitting the strip. The chef really does an amazing job and the menu is just unreal. The bar is amazing also full bar and tons of great drinks, not to mention every bartender just has an amazing attitude and are extremely friendly. Starboard and tack this one on your places to go list. Overall just amazing."}
{"text":"Really cool spot.  It's kind of hidden away but we didn't have an issue finding it.  We came during the day so it was very chill. I'm not sure how it is at night.  I had the cheeseburger and fries, very tasty. The lucky cat was delicious, milk tea heaven.  Totally recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and love the staff. Oh and their mango chi chi is sooooo delicious and served in an adorable panda cup! They have some light food options too, I haven't tried the food but my friend did and said the skewers were great!"}
{"text":"Horrible. It's trying to be a tiki bar but seems more like a restaurant. I ordered a signature cocktail, bartender says they are out of that. I ordered a different one, they are out of that too. The only thing i can say is that it's a building, it will keep you out of the rain."}
{"text":"Mmmmmhmmmm I'm into Starboard Tack. This place has a \"locals bar\" feel--I felt like I'd walked into the place where cool LV natives go to escape the strip. My friend and I checked it out on a Monday night and we were two of about seven people--a nice escape from the downtown crowds (and heat). I love the tiki/seafood spot feel of Starboard, especially the wallpaper and midcentury couches + rattan chairs. The food menu also looks fun--I was bummed we'd just eaten. Fish & chips, oysters, and poké felt like total vacation food.   Since we arrived with full bellies, we dove straight into the cocktail menu. They've got ten or so  really fun and creative cocktails on their list, plus a frozen drink and a mango chi chi. I went with the mango chi chi per Taylor S's (the lovely Vegas Community Manager) suggestion--this chick knows a good cocktail. I think this was definitely the best chi chi I've ever had, and served in the cutest glass to boot. My friend had a mezcal forward drink that was half blue and half green--I'm not much of a tequila lady and found this drink to be a little strong, but the colors were absolutely gorgeous.  Our server took the time to give us a rundown on the history of the bar--make sure to check out the old photos of Starboard Tack in the 70's over by the fireplace. While not much of the decor was original (except for the wood tables), they did a great job with the retro/throwback vibe. Speaking of our server, he was fantastic. He offered to make my friend a new drink if the one she didn't love the one she ordered (she did) and checked in with us often (but not too often, if ya know what I mean).   While I think this is definitely a five star establishment, I had to drop a star for the smoking situation. Toward the end of our visit, a guy pulled up to the bar, lit a cigarette, and proceeded to smoke the entire thing inside. I don't think that's legal here since it's not a casino, plus it's just super gross. Paired with the dry air, our eyes were burning and we decided to leave. Definitely still suggest checking this place out, though!"}
{"text":"You want to get away from the BS of Vegas and just have a good drink, you come here.   I enjoy locally owned spots. And even more so, locally owned spaces by good people doing good work. I was brought over here from a collective group of mixologist that i frequent, and one of them decided to open up this space. Tough to find if your not using GPS but i kind of like that as i prefer not to have such a crowd. The interior is older and nautical themed with a bit of that old smell still left behind. Even though the space is not much to look at, the drinks are impressive and inexpensive for the offerings. The service was on point, and very punctual. I even ordered a bit of food and was quite pleased with the rather large mussels in a bit of curry sauce and fries. I will be back, and i will come more hungry next time."}
{"text":"I am going to go ahead and expand on Mariena Mercer's description of this place where she imagined it featured in a Tarantino film, featuring  the great cocktails and food. This is much more than that in that it is more like the brainchild between a Chang and Tarantino. They've definitely got the camp going on with the mural and the rum and pirate scenes but they also serve some fantastic cocktails with pretty great food. I've had literally every single one of their cocktails and they've all been delish. All of the skewers are delish, they are served with white rice and an awesomely addictive peanut sauce. I've also tried their poke bowl, chicken strips and wings, and they are all solid. The fries are freshly cut and are AMAZING. I could order two plates for myself.   I was excited to hear that te team from Retroscena in DTLV behind the operations of this bar. I loved Retroscena, they had a spectacular selection of amaros and cocktails but unfortunately served too much a niche market to be successful. Anyway, the men know their liquor!   I am so happy to see a bar so east of the DTLV."}
{"text":"I came here the other night and had a good time. The bartenders really made the experience. The one with the tattoos and longer hair was hilarious and had a great vibe. I'm only giving 4 stars because the chairs are so uncomfortable ! I was in heels and I actually preferred standing and then the next day my butt was actually bruised from the edge of the chair! Please get better chairs! Also they didn't have any energy drinks which I thought was strange for a bar.."}
{"text":"Read and heard the food was excellent, but left before being able to try it. We sat at the bar, which was dirty, and no one took our order (even though there weren't many people there). My wife and I felt that the dried chucks of food caked on the video poker machine and being ignored by the bartender was a sign from above to leave, so we did."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out based on everyone's reviews. It always seems that the local dives are always the best. But not in this case. We don't like to complain but won't be back. Bottled beer wasn't cold. Asked for a cold glass and were told they were for the draft beer. I guess the 5 other customers in the bar might go through those quickly? The pictures of the food looked really good but after the ordering the fried Chicken fried rice, complete disappointment. Tasted like frozen bagged fried rice from Walmart. Then the chicken skewers tasted great but still raw in the middle. Not a good visit."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic except for the decor. Theres something very off putting about having raw oysters (the best in town) and tuna poke in an ugly dirty bar with bathrooms that are consistenly gross."}
{"text":"There are many things to enjoy about Las Vegas.  I'm not a native, but make my way out a few times a year.  I will never visit again without spending the majority of my time at Starboard Tack.  This place has it all!  Panda Bear daily special drink cups; Wheelchair accessible restroom stalls; Video Poker; Authentic retro booths; Bar Menu perfection; Tuesday Night Karaoke and wet t-shirt contests; Pleather throws for when you're chilly; Chicken wangs; Vodka; Branded evening wear; A dog friendly patio; Ample parking... The list goes on and on.  You'll not regret making this your go-to destination."}
{"text":"This spot is sweet. Very dark, cozy and tropical inspired. Their cocktails and unique and refreshing. Combining very tropical floral flavors to them. I recommend this spot if you want to feel like you're hanging out by the beach (even though you're in the middle of the desert at 120 degrees). OH, and their oysters. Yes."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal here. Everything was on point. Our waiter was excellent and we even got love from the kitchen. We had the salted coconut creme brulee for dessert, it was excellent. This place is a new favorite. However, they need to get iced tea, they should have a door presence and they should set the tables. I still loved the place though."}
{"text":"This little cozy spot is almost missed if you aren't looking for it. It has a small town feel and we perched ourselves on the couches and awaited a group of coworkers. To amuse ourselves, we sampled the happy hour menu. The service was excellent despite the continuous flow of customers pouring in. The skewers were tender and delicious. The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked. My husband found the oysters to be fresh and sweet.  The empanadas were flaky and an unusual delight."}
{"text":"It definitely has that dive and old tiki bar vibes, but you'll be coming for the fantastic food and drink menu served all day.  Starboard Taquiri ($8): Plantation Pineapple, Lime, Sugar, and Pernod. A little on the bitter side, but otherwise tasty.  Cherry Blossom ($8): Whistling Andy Hibiscus Rum, Lime, Fassinola, Maraschino Liqueur, and Cherry Bitters. A beautiful cocktail and lovely flavors; one of their most popular!  Longanisa Empanadas ($6): Filipino-style longanisa, green olive, egg, and roasted red pepper with chili vinegar crema. I was really surprised and pleased with this dish. I'm a big fan of longanisa, but it tends to be salty and can overwhelm a dish. This empanada was well-balanced and very delicious. It comes two to a plate, so order accordingly.  Fried Chicken Fried Rice ($12) with sunny side-up egg. The fried rice seems more Indo-influenced and we enjoyed it. The fried chicken was great, too, but I didn't care for it mixed into the rice as it took away from its crispy texture.  West Indies Fried Chicken Sandwich ($10): Walkerswood jerk aïoli, Pineapple pickles, and fries. Out of the three dishes we tried, this one was a clear winner. The chicken is unbelievably juicy with the crispiest exterior; just amazing. Our bartender recommended getting the pineapple pickles on the side and we're so glad we did! The pickles are amazing, but quite pungent, so it was nice to take a bite when we wanted. The fries were also good though a tad overdone.  I'm not a dive bar expert, but I was not expecting such great food here. We were blown away with the flavors and quality. Plus, the menu is such a fun fusion of cuisines. Sadly, it's a drive for me, so I won't find myself here often. However, I'm happy to explore the rest of the menu when I have the opportunity!"}
{"text":"What a fun place.  Visiting Las Vegas from New York, came into Starboard Tack with a coworker and a friend on a weekday night, looking to have a lowkey night with cocktails at local spot. It's a bit out of the way from the hustle and bustle of the strip (thank god,) but this bar hit the nail on the head - tiki hut-themed, couches and chairs for intimate conversation, and a longass bar with locals playing casino games built into the counter.  The bartender was working solo that night and came out to give us menus and serve us drinks we'd order. Craving something sweet, my coworker recommended the Chi Chi and so I went for it. It was flavored with guava that night, and boy was it tasty. The best part? Served in an adorable ceramic panda mug with a straw the chest, I knocked back about 4 of them (oops.) We also ordered the Chicken Fried Rice, which came with a sunny side up egg. That definitely hit the spot.  Despite our server being the only one working that night, he was pretty attentive, super nice, and quick with my Chi Chi refills. I'm not sure how many ceramic pandas they have, but I definitely used out a good portion of the ones they have.  Not trying to deal with the tourist bullshit and enjoy some drinks? Hit up Starboard Tack, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Starboard Tack has been my go to  for the last few months on my way home from work.  Great environment, friendly staff and exceptional service.  24/7 kitchen with good food.  Big fan of the chicken skewers and peanut sauce.  I usually see Mia there on grave and she's become one of my favorite late nights bartenders in the city.   Do yourself a favor and come down here.  Eat, drink, gamble and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great drinks and the most awesome Fries you'll ever eat. I love their stained glass windows in the dining room. Very cool spot, a definite must see! Vegas needs more bars like this. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"This lowkey spot is definitely a new go to with a cool beachy vibe and it's open 24 hours! The bartenders are all friendly and the drinks are so yummy. Don't miss out on the food here, it's a hit. Shared food with some friends and tried a few different items off the menu and all were great, especially the fried rice! If you're looking for a bar with a good cocktail and a new take on bar food then this is a place to check out."}
{"text":"To go back two nights in a row, and only when you're in town for three nights total, it must be good. I had Starboard Tack bookmarked for quite awhile and they didn't disappoint.   Tiki drinks, french fries, and festive wallpaper are all things I find appealing in a drinking establishment - Starboard Tack has them all aplenty. That, plus a lizard to boot.   Everyone raves about the Chi Chi served in a panda mug and yes, it's good. You could also order the signature daiquiri and wouldn't be disappointed. The best thing about drinking late at night here is that the kitchen stays open and patrons can fill 'er up while whetting their whistle.   The only drawback is the smoke. I forgot what it's like to stay up past midnight period. Add cigarettes into the equation and the next day is rough! Even if you're not directly inhaling, that second hand stuff is pretty powerful. Be sure to take a hot shower when you get home and spray the hell out of your jacket/scarf.  Beyond that Starboard Tack is my Las Vegas Kitty Coehn's - a top favorite bar in Austin. They've got a lot of the same vibes and I'm digging it."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot, it is away from the strip and tranquil. The drinks and food are incredible, I was not expecting much but they truly blew my mind. They also have a good selection of draft beer, mostly craft which I like. Prices were not bad at all, I would most def  return to this place."}
{"text":"Starboard Tack just had their soft opening last night. They have a huge selection of rum and an interesting menu that I'm looking forward to working my way through. Had their chicken fingers last night. They're the best I've had in Vegas. Expecting good things out of this place."}
{"text":"This is a great bar. The owners are super friendly. The beer is great. The food is awesome. And you can watch a football game with friends pretty comfortably on their couches if you don't want to sit t the bar. All around amazing spot!"}
{"text":"I live in the apartments that share the parking lot. They really turned the place around. A friend and I went during the soft opening. I loves it. Tropical menu from the drinks to the food! The drinks were of great quality and definitely worth the price! The bartenders were amazing and the whole vibe of the place is cool,laid back and a great place to unwind"}
{"text":"They HOOK IT UP with the chicken strip meal at night. Super fresh fries! Everyone is always smiling when I go in. Have had their drinks and the fish and chips when they first opened and those were great too. Looks like they took away the coffee slush when I last went in; that was awesome and should come back. Hole in the wall it may be, but it's extremely tasty."}
{"text":"First and foremost the beer is hot! Sit down hot beer saw the fried rice online somewhere had to go check it out should have known egg on top was black on the bottom from being burnt but was runny on top and the fried rice is forzen heatup  chicken satay undercooked like pink and runny in the middle dont waste the trip.....and the cook was hanging out at the end of the bar in a oversized black hoodie that was dirty as shit smokeing poker tighter than strip casinos"}
{"text":"Tiki vintage feelings!  I do love this place. I am a born and raised local, so I have known of this bar before its currect state. The update is very pleasant. Lots of space to sit and fun little tiki decor. The drinks were delicious. Unfortunately, I lost count after the second drink because the staff poured generously. I also sampled some grub...oh my the longanisa empanadas were absolutely delicious. I do wish there were a few more, but four piping hot won me over. The price of all the items suited my wallet very well.  A great place to rediscover after many years of vacancy. I am sure this place will be another local favorite. Also, keep an ear out for a particular song... if you hear you get to ring the golden bell and maybe something special will happen."}
{"text":"I ended up here by accident and was like what the hell.  This place is so freaking cool.  I don't normally drink cocktails, but after watching the bartenders I ordered a Gunpowder Swizzle, definitely will be a regular thing.  Just a really cool 60's vibe going on."}
{"text":"What to expect from a tiny bar in a small residential part of the city.  I had no idea either.  The Tack was popular on the 70's before changing to Gilligan's and now the new owners have paid homage to the original name.  The drinks are on par with any mixology bar but at reasonable prices between 8-12. The food options are limited in number but the taste was far better than what you would expect from a bar.  The fired chicken fried rice is excellent. Definitely going to be a regular stop this summer after work."}
{"text":"This place is super fun and great prices .....  CJ the graveyard bartender is very handsome  He has a very muscular physique and a enormous  bulge in his pantaloons... try the skewers they're amazing"}
{"text":"A cool nostalgic step back in time for me kind of night!   Yes, this was the spot to go to back in the 1980's and early 90's for fresh seafood and the best all you can eat salad and soup bar. Just a quick memory from me as a 30 year resident...Back in the day... In the 80's the original Cashman Cadillac dealership used to be right next door, so we would go buy the latest and greatest new Cadillac and go for a lobster dinner.  It was our go to spot. All the cool Vegas folks were there. It was intimate, pricey and super exclusive. Even if we just wanted our car detailed for no reason we would always hang at the Starboard. Sometimes we were there so many times a month, I would get spoiled and say 'No More'   So, after reading on Yelp that it was back up with the original name, I had to step back in time and revisit.   Its now a cool hipster kinda bar with a different kind of vibe. Walking in felt like it did 30 years before. I felt home. It seems smaller than before, but still the same intimate feeling.   The food is outstanding and the prices are so affordable on any budget. Ordered the chicken tempura $8, empanadas $6 and the daily poke(tuna) $10. Delicious! the chicken tempura was the best! A must! And the drinks are about 70% less price wise than you pay at at any bar close or on the strip.  Its in a very remote residential neighborhood on the east side of the Las Vegas strip, but completely safe and easy to find. Lots of free parking(private lot).  I love going back in time and revisiting old spots I used to frequent, and this is a definite gem. Support our local businesses and give it a try. Waiting for a 'Yelp Event' in the near future...hint hint.  Thank you! Great business and super nice customer service."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  Good drinks.  I can't wait to try the food here.  The only thing I didn't like was that they took my ID in order for me to order \"The Lucky Cat.\""}
{"text":"A rare 5 star from me. I really like this place. Its got everything I need in a neighborhood style dive bar. Good food - wide selection of delicious items from oysters to burgers, some asian themed dishes, and all fairly priced. Good drinks - A nice variety of specialty cocktails mostly featuring rum (think tiki drinks) but also a nice selection of other excellent spirits, and a decent beer menu as well.  TVs - great for watching sports, even a huge screen in the lounge area. I watched the Pacquaio/Horn fight here.  Gaming - quite a few gaming stations as well as open spaces for non-gamers at the bar.  Great place, great owners, great food, great drinks....it's just great.  Located just off East Sahara on Atlantic."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for it's awesome unpretentious neighborhood vibe. Bryant and Lyle are mixing some great cocktails, and for a rum lover like me this is a great place to grab a drink or two. I had the Caribbean Coral (?), a Rum Julep and another cocktail - I forgot the name but not the taste. The chicken wings in fish sauce are gooey, yummy carmelized goodness. And I even won $40. I'll definitely be going back again and again and taking friends."}
{"text":"I simply love this place.  I heard it had a little history because it was originally Starboard Tack and then became Gilligan's Hideaway for many many years. Two young entrepreneurs who love and have massive industry experience take over and bring it back to it's roots. Alas, Starboard Tack is born again. I love a good comeback story.  The place is huge. You walk right in towards the bar but there is a giant seating area full of booths to the back right. Just to the right of the bar are a few couches as well. There is a giant projection screen that comes down for sporting events in this area, or so I'm told.  Starboard won my heart with the Mango Chi-Chi. It's frozen, tropical, refreshing, and delicious. It also comes in a ceramic panda cup, so I might order it no matter what was inside just for that. They have a great cocktail menu and a very talented bar staff. The draft beer selection is a nice mix of beers and the can/bottle variety is on point. My favorite draft they have right now is the Ballast Point Amber. I'll take two, and I have many times.  The food at Starboard is even better. My favorite menu item right now is the Mongolian Cheesesteak. I've had it several times. The meat is tender, the cheese is hot and bubbling, and the onions are caramelized to perfection. The sauce completes the sandwich, in addition to the side of fresh cut fries. Skin on. Yessssssss. Want a side of ketchup? Ask and you shall receive.  This place is basically my local watering hole now, so I'll see you there."}
