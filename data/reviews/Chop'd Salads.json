{"text":"I understand that it takes time to make a salad, but today I waited behind 2 people for over 10 minutes.  When I finally got to place my order I asked for today's special - pub cheeseburger with bag of chips.  She asked what I wanted on the burger - lettuce, tomato, and some mustard.  Out of tomato. Seriously? It's listed on the menu as having tomato.  When I got back to my office I saw there was no cheese either.  Not the first time they have messed up my order."}
{"text":"A few of my co-workers and myself ordered some salads from here today. Lettuce was wilted and wet which made everything else wet and as far as the extras...not much. I was so looking forward to trying this place but I doubt if we will ever get a salad from this place again. If you specialize in salads the lettuce at least needs to be fresh."}
{"text":"Yeah... I'm gonna need one of these closer to the burbs that I frequent. Convincing someone to make the trek to Independence to get me a salad for lunch isn't going to happen too often. 

But every so often I get this is a choice thanks to a co-worker having to be out on site... and happiness abounds when he brings this back for me. 

Chopped salads are one of my personal favorites anyway - you get everything mixed up and all covered in dressing and in bite size bits, rather than having all the dressing on the top two pieces of lettuce that are way too big to fit in your mouth and then you end up with dressing all over your face or the table... (Unless you spend 15 minutes before you eat slicing it all up as best you can.)... Or is it just me that has these problems?? Anyway,  they've got my love just for doing the chopped salad thing, right off the bat. 

Mix your own chopped salad from a choice of romaine, iceberg, mesculin, or spinach as the lettuce and a nice selection of \"chop-ins\" - a number of veggies, meats, cheeses, fruits and nuts. (The only thing that seems to be missing from their list is banana peppers.) Three free from one group to go with the $6.25 base salad; an additional charge for more or for any of the meats and  fancier additions... all in all, mostly reasonable price, especially if you're not a meat eater. 26 different dressings to choose from (counting the lite versions). 

There's also a number of pre-determined salads, wraps, soup, chips... 

As for taste - I can only vouch for my own master salad mixing skills, in the sense that I just build my own. The smokey bacon ranch dressing is the only I've tasted yet. I might try some of the others one day. Maybe. But the veggies all have seemed fresh enough, and the red onion was potent, and that's my barometer for a salad choice really. (Why have dead red onion??) 

The chili tastes almost exactly like Wendy's chili - not an altogether bad thing, as there are times when I crave that flavor... but didn't wow me as anything spectacular either. (And could use some spice and/or hot sauce added.) 


Looking forward to trying more next time the co-worker is out that way, if I can't convince them to open up more convenient location for me..."}
