{"text":"No glitz...not fancy...just an older Wisconsin supper club with great service, great food, and good prices."}
{"text":"This is an old place. Very dark and old fashioned. The food reflects this. Bland and non-creative. They do have a great salad bar that is always well stocked and is not expensive. I would go for the salad bar."}
{"text":"When we go out for a fish we always go to Rex's. The staff is very friendly  and the wait is never that long. They also have an amazing salad bar that alot of fish frys in town no longer have."}
{"text":"Bad menu and ambiance, expensive, my steak was overcooked and not grilled. Also, an NRA supporter."}
{"text":"Salad bar is great, has extra things like pasta salad, and unusual items such beets and chickpeas. Wait was only 30 mins and got to sit at the bar until called to dining room. Bar prices were cheap, good, strong drinks. . Prices for meal were excellent. Friday fish fry -cod & haddock under $12. Amount of fish was adequate, not an all you can eat but with the large salad bar you left full and often with a to go bag. Walleye was excellent.  Bands play weekends after 9 in bar area.  Great experience for us just passing through."}
{"text":"Consistently good, amazing fried chicken, solid salad and soup bar. (This is weird to yelp about a place I don't remember first visiting.)"}
{"text":"Came here with family of 16 people, the service was great, the food was good, I ordered steak tenderloin and lobster tail entree, the steak was perfectly done and the lobster tail was good, it else comes with salad and soup buffet with entree, the soup was very salty, would not recommend but the salad bar was good."}
{"text":"Terrific supper club.  Went for the first time on Sunday and was very pleased with the food and service.  The resturant provides a good value for the price and has a great salid bar."}
{"text":"The salad bar is about the only thing going for it.  Had hoped that a place that is generally pretty busy would be a great supper club, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case.  The feel, the decor, the bar are typical supper club but the entrees...nope.  My wife and I have tried the Friday fish fry 2x and both times were very disappointed. The fish looked and tasted exactly like they came from a box of VandeKamps frozen fish filet.  Same unnatural shape, thin, with same breading.  Nothing like a true beer battered cod or haddock.  

I think the only reason the place is busy is due to the cheap prices and lack of other options in the area.  We won't be going again, it may well be the worst fish fry I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I'm from Chicago and it was a nice change of pace coming here.  The staff was friendly and very accommodating.   Everyone I was with had the broasted chicken or ribs.  The chicken was excellent and the ribs were falling off the bone.  The salad bar was great and so was the beef and vegetable soup.  The cheese curds were my favorite appetizer.  You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck here"}
{"text":"I am a Waunakee native and Rex's has been around for as long as I can remember. I have eaten there a few times and I'm sad to say I have never been impressed. One positive thing I have to say is the salad bar is good. Besides that I have never been overly impressed with the food, especially considering the prices. One of the worst times we had is when we went and ordered steak. The service was very slow. They finally took our order after a half hour of trying to flag down our server. Then it took almost a half hour for food to arrive at the table and it was only my daughters food. We were told it would be a few minutes for our steaks.  About 15 minutes later (after my daughter was almost finished eating) we got our steaks. We asked for medium well and both got steaks that were barely warm, still raw and bleeding. We were so sick of sitting there we got boxes and left. I cooked the steaks when we got home. I was too mad to eat. My husband ate some and said it tasted old and a little off. Such a waste of money. We have not been back since."}
{"text":"My uncle treated my wife and I here for dinner a few nights back. It's definitely old school, but has its positives. The salad bar is decent. I was impressed by their mushroom soup; it was creamy and flavorful. My wife wasn't a huge fan of it for some reason, and she loves mushrooms.

We started with the beer battered mushrooms. I can't remember if I liked it because my wife ate most of it (the mushroom lover who didn't like the mushroom soup). I had the broiled walleye, which probably wasn't the best choice on the menu. It was bland. I chose hash browns for my side. Pretty sure they used a slice of Kraft singles American cheese and plopped it on top. Not impressed.

My wife loved her prime rib. She ordered the queen-sized 12 oz portion. It was cooked medium-rare as she requested, but maybe a little bit more bloody than I could stomach. But she likes her meat moo-ing, so she was satisfied. It's a pretty thick piece too.

Not gonna be on our list of regulars, but it wasn't terrible. Next time, I'll avoid the fish and go for some meat."}
{"text":"Fantastic salad bar! My wife and I were both stuffed before our meals came out. There was a lot of variety and something for everyone. Food came out piping hot. Service is very friendly. Glad we came here!"}
{"text":"I love Rex's! The coconut shrimp is hands down my favorite in southern Wisconsin. I feel connected to my Wisconsin roots whenever I stop in, the people that eat at Rex's are super nice and there to have a good time. The cocktails are old school and great!"}
{"text":"Perhaps because I did not grow up in Wisconsin and grew up in a big city, I simply don't \"get\" supper clubs. While I would like that to be the reason I was disappointed with my experience at Rex's, it's not. The lack of quality in food is the reason I was disappointed. 

Another Yelp reviewer mentioned that Rex's fried fish might be Van de Kamp's frozen fish filets, and I'm afraid I have to agree. I enjoy Culver's fried fish better than Rex's!

The hash browns, rolls and coleslaw I ate at Rex's also were not up to par. I never -- NEVER -- reach for a salt shaker to add salt to my food. I had to at Rex's to give the hash browns any flavor. The coleslaw furthermore was bland, and the rolls did not seem fresh. They were on the chewy side and did not have the texture of a freshly baked dinner roll.

The gothic/Medieval (not sure what it's called?) decor is creepy, in my opinion, and the carpeting inside Rex's is \"seasoned,\" to quote my husband!

I won't go back."}
{"text":"Food average at best,but salad bar was good.Breading on broasted chicken way \"too heavy\"..Service OK.No happy hour in bar.On \"plus side\" I felt like the youngest person there."}
{"text":"Posting on behalf of of all the 2017 Waunakee graduates.  Rex's again provided support for the post Graduation activities in the form of food.  TERRIFIC chicken tenders were a huge hit with the kids and adult volunteers.  Outstanding quality and wonderful community benefactor."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Rex's.  Great salad bar.  Everything was fresh, plentiful, and a nice variety.  The mushroom soup was delicious.  You can definitely make a meal of the salad bar.  We also had the cod.  Very good.  We ate at the bar, great service from Belinda.  Will be back."}
{"text":"So first I find it hilarious that this place has been around for how long and only has 27 reviews.  But upon further thinking, if the average age of the customer here is what maybe 55+...then the use of Yelp is probably semi-lacking, haha.  But anyways.  We came here last night with neighbors because we live in Waunakee and we were pretty sure its like a Waunakee icon so a visit needed to happen.  It was exactly what I expected, \"charming\" old school supper club decor, with food that was edible but nothing that blew me away.  However, my husband's medium-rare Steak Oscar was cooked fantastic and was probably the best part of everything on the table.  My broiled haddock and baked potato were alright but nothing I couldn't do at home.  The fun part about a supper club is the soup and salad bar that comes with your order.  I did enjoy their turkey & rice soup and the salad bar section was your average.  Definitely can't say I'm dying to return but I am glad we gave it a shot and can say we supported a local biz!"}
{"text":"Rex's on a Saturday night.  Drinks before dinner were fine, but a little more expensive than I am used to for a rural supper club.  Apparently the proximity to Madison means they can have higher prices...

The salad bar wasn't bad, though the greens left something to be desired.  But the steak.  Oh the steak.  I ordered mine \"Medium\" and it came out rare, and cold.  Fries were fine but felt like they had been shaken out of a frozen bag and tossed in a fryer.  Waitress wasn't even around to try to send the steak back, and never came over to check on us - so I ate it because I was starving.  

There are plenty of good supper clubs out there - I likely won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"The review is based on a recent wedding reception held at Rex's innkeeper.

Upon entering the banquet room from the parking lot, I definitely got the \"Supper Club\" feeling.  The room is actually made up of two smaller rooms.  The smaller area where appetizers (snacks) and greeting tables were set up over the dance floor.  Also, there is a bar between the banquet room and the main dining room.    The larger portion of the room was set up with the balance of the tables.  Even though between the two areas, there were enough seating for 200 people.   There plenty of space between the tables and the public area. There was also a smaller bar in the banquet area.

The couple had opted to have Family Style.  The Fruit Salad, the Pasta Salad and  the main entrees (baked chicken, ham, mashed potatoes, vegetables) were brought to the table all at the same time.  I thought that was a little odd, but it's Wisconsin......  The wait staff were very attentive to all of the tables and guests.    After the main meal was completed, the staff quickly cleared the dirty dishes before the cake was served.  

After the meal, the staff had dismantled the tables dancing area.  Again, the dancing area seemed large enough where had plenty of area to dance and enjoy themselves.   

Overall, it was a great experience attending a wedding at Rex's Innkeeper."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for outdated salad bars and supper clubs in general, so I liked this place.  I wouldn't say it's very memorable in its own right, though.

The interior is done up in a kitschy, vaguely Olive Garden-style theme--hints of a retirement home, especially since hardly anyone was under 50 except for our table and the servers.  The salad bar was decent, with a good range of toppings and a few pasta-salad type sides, though the soup and the dressing tasted very institutional.

I can't speak for anything else on the menu, except for the shrimp cocktail, which was bland and clearly straight from a freezer.  The bar area is a bit interesting, there seems to be a space for polkas or something and a semi-divided room where dozens of old people were playing cards."}
{"text":"We have been to more than a few supper clubs for Friday Fish Fry and this one needs some help. The decor was fine. When visiting a super club you expect it to be dated and a little dingy; which Rex's fits. However, the service was bad, the fish took forever, and it was over-priced. There must have been 10 waitresses working, but no one was getting regular service. I guess everyone is smoking cigarettes. The salad bar is Not included in the fish special; it's 3.99 extra. Every other night of the week it's free with the special. WTF? The fish took 35 minutes to show up. It doesn't take that long to fry and there weren't a lot of people in there. This place needs a restaurant makeover. Go to maple tree in McFarland. Don't go to Rex's."}
{"text":"Came here with family for a Friday Night Fish fry. We had a reservation for 5:30 and were seated promptly, although I was the youngest one there by 30 years! Traditional supper club, outdated decor. They make a great old fashioned. The fish was definately frozen and overcooked, chewy and lacking flavor. It was actually hard to cut. Fish should flake, this didn't . It was extreely disappointing. We also ordered cheese curds. They were ok. The cheese wasn't melted so either they wern't cooked enough or sat in a window to die. I woudn't recommend this place to anyone else. 

It did look like they had a beautiful salad bar although for $3 extra, I didn't need it. Our server was wonderful however. She was attentive and the pace of the meal was nice."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. The food was good and the waitress was nice. However I wasn't overly impressed with their Mother's Day brunch. Prices were a little high and the selection wasn't huge. Would have been nice to have waffles, pancakes or French toast as an option."}
{"text":"Rex's is an aging supper club. My parents like this joint and it is a locally owned place. It feels like it's hanging on... It's really one of the only proper sit down dinner places in Waunakee. 

The food is predictable and it does still have the beloved Wisco Supper Club Salad Bar."}
{"text":"I avoid Rex's when I can, but large group meals or when dining out with friends will often bring me there.  I've eaten there easily a dozen times, both lunch and dinner.  

The food is adequate.  Generally more institutional than you would expect for the price (soups are not homemade, potatoes are instant, meat is usually pre-sliced and merely heated).  The service is decent and usually not offensive.  

The bar is pretty decent."}
{"text":"So the owner is super nice and the bar has some really good craft  beers available, but the food wasn't that great.  Really good service too, just wish that the food was better."}
{"text":"Supper clubs are unfortunately starting to fade away in our society and that is why I was so happy when I recently discovered Rex's Innkeeper in Waunakee.  I went with a couple family members who raved about the food and salad bar and they were exactly right.  Cannot even remember the last time I attended a restaurant and been this satisfied with every single item I ordered! Thank you! Service was friendly, the salad bar was stacked with fresh items and various choices: had homemade croutons, multiple types of wrapped crackers (sure sign of a classic supper club), the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted (creamy and homemade), A+!   I ordered one of their specials for my entree which was a salmon dish and it was prepared perfectly and adorned with a creamy/tasty sauce on top.  Bread and butter is complimentery item for each guest.  Yes the decor is a bit dated (80's)...but truly who cares??!!! With food this good it's no big deal! Will be back:)"}
{"text":"Stopped in late on a Saturday night. Traditional supper club with a European theme to it. We wanted to stay in Waunakee for dinner (as opposed to going in to Madison). It met our needs but, was just average. Hostess/servers were friendly and efficient but, not overly so.

I felt the A-OK rating fit best. Considered a fourth star though."}
