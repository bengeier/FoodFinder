{"text":"I would want to say that this is the best poke that I had in the town. Their fish are so fresh fish temperature was perfect. The place was very clean  You can also try their beef and chicken if you are not a fish person. Very healthy meal after a gyms workout. Good size proteins and veggies. You should check this place out!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Friendly service and not too busy. Seafood is fresh and they are generous with the portions!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The spicy tuna and salmon are tasty and so fresh! They offer unlimited toppings and you can choose between 1,2,3 scoops of protein. The scoops are very generous sizes! Too bad I live in Texas, or else I'd be here every week!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in Phoenix for Hawaiian/Asian kind of food. They always have fresh and tasty food and staff is extraordinarily friendly. Place is so clean that it's a pleasure to come here and eat. You will also get loyal guest card so that with 9 purchased meals you get 10th one for free. If I could I would give them 10 out of 10 stars, you definitely missing out if you don't come here and try the whole variety of delicious food!"}
{"text":"Not a great value.  The amount of meat they serve are small portions.  And they promote cheaper meats like chicken, beef and tuna.  I never heard of a chicken poke bowl.  And their medium size for $9 (2 meats) will just barely got up if you are hungry."}
{"text":"I was looking for a casual place to kill time since I was waiting for an appointment. I'm so glad I chose to come here. I've been wanting to try a poke bowl for a very long time, and they did not disappoint!!! Everything tasted so fresh and the atmosphere is calm and clean. Exactly what I was looking for. Not to mention it's a wonderful price for what you get. Also, thank you for your kind associates who were very helpful! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from a make your own poke bowl kind of place except the marinated fresh fish.  They have spicy tuna, regular tuna and salmon (among other options), but the couple of other poke restaurants I have been to have better fresh fish that is pre-marinated.  I also thought there were a couple of options missing - fresh cilantro, cucumber salad, fruits like mango, etc.  what they do have is good and fresh.  I would not hesitate to dine in again."}
{"text":"I got carryout from Poke Catcher and all I can say is wow! I'm impressed. I love the selections of protein as well as the choices of toppings. I chose the spicy crab and ahi dynomite and loved every bite. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Phx whenever I want a fast, healthy, delicious meal. The food is always fresh and the price is right!!"}
{"text":"Great service! It's mainly a poke place, but they also have specialty drinks, wraps, and teriyaki bowls. Tasty. It's within walking distance from hospital which made it a good place for us to grab a quick lunch to bring back."}
{"text":"An overall great experience. Started with awesome customer service and ended a delicious poke bowl in my belly."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. My food looked better in the photo on the window. I paid for the Hawaiian bbq wrap but it is bbq crap. They didnt even cut it for me. Not returning ever"}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles so poké has become a pretty mainstream and popular food. So i guess you could say i have high standards for poké. I decided to try poké catcher as it is close to my apartment and i needed a poké fix. The staff were super friendly and accommodating and the portion size was pretty big so I can't complain there. My issues were with the freshness of the ingredients. I've had poké from LA and Hawaii and you could definitely tell it was fresh as soon as you bit into it, but at poké catcher the texture and taste of the fish is way different. You can definitely tell their fish is frozen and thawed out. I bought a small bowl and ended up only eating a few bites because i just couldn't handle the taste or texture of the fish. Sad to say that I wasn't able to satisfy my poké craving."}
{"text":"Good service, clean nice little place with really good poke bowls. They have their own version of spicy mayo, and the lady working was really nice and gave me a generous portion. Would revoke d to everyone."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, it was excellent.  I got a 3-protein bowl with white rice, salmon, ahi tuna, and spicy crab.  Everything was delicious and the eating area was spotless and has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love love love this new place.  Super fresh, delicious, and lots of great options. The owners are so friendly and helpful too. Prices are super reasonable for the great product--about $10 for a medium bowl (which is actually big) and a drink. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break and saw it had a good star rating. But i'm from California where poke places are all over and i'm used to amazing poke. This place was just okay. There was nothing special about it. I got a medium poke bowl and i am not a person who can eat very much but that bowl was incredibly small. Also, I got teriyaki sauce and I couldn't even taste it. I also got a smoothie which was delicious but my total meal was 15$ and i was not full or satisfied. It's an okay place but not great. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, not sure if its because I ordered delivery or what but I took two bites and threw it away. Mushy salmon, no flavor to anything, really gross. Would hope they try an serve fresh fish and it was the opposite"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with poké, but last time I had it, I was in Hawaii -- and as much as I would have loved to be transported to Hawaii on the beach, hearing the waves of the ocean crash on the shore while enjoying a fresh poké bowl -- I had to make do with thinking about Hawaii (for now) and eat poké.   This place is extremely cozy, welcoming, and quite easy to find. The fish and ingredients are extremely fresh, and it's great that it's a make-your-own poké bowl kinda place -- you choose your base, then your protein (yes, you can have more than one), then the sauce, and finally all the toppings.   I chose Brown rice, topped with Salmon and Ahi Tuna (so fresh and not fishy), with Citrus Balsamic Vinaigrette (and some spicy aioli on the side), and I went crazy with all the toppings and got most everything I could fit on the bowl. (No guilt involved 'cause it's all healthy stuff, so go ahead, splurge on the toppings!)  I highly recommend Poké Catcher! It's fresh ingredients in a poké bowl at a reasonable price, that will satisfy the tummy. I will definitely be back again. Oh, and they have drinks from Hawaii to enjoy with your bowl! Win-win!"}
{"text":"Very Friendly Staff! This Place is always Clean. They give out great proportions. I love Poke. I've been to many Poke Spot in AZ this is simply the best"}
{"text":"Great bowls! Super fresh and also really inexpensive compared to other poké joints!  I'll eat  here anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I tried this Poke Catcher for the first time today. The place is very cute and the food tastes fresh, healthy, and delicious. The staff is very kind and willing to answer questions. I had the spicy crab and shrimp, which were both fantastic. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't too bad. Decent selection, clean interior, and it's just a short walk from my work. My only problem with this place is the portion size. While the rice amount is reasonable, they completely skimp on the other items. The bowl itself is literally the same size as one of my breakfast bowls at home. They give you about a teaspoonful of the mix-ins like masago and seaweed salad. I had to ask for another teaspoonful of seaweed so I could get more than one mouthful out of it. I'd have called my large bowl a \"medium\" at best.  If you want far better value for money, go to Poke Bar - where a large is four scoops, not three, and they give you a plentiful amount of mixins and a properly sized bowl. Probably won't come back here until they boost the value for money and quit skimping."}
{"text":"The very best. First of all the owner was so nice, opening and spent a good amount of time telling us her story and how she came to Arizona. It was great to hear and got us thinking about a move. The food was fresh and soo tasty. The hibiscus tea is a must!"}
{"text":"Poke Catcher is so good. Great portions, very fair prices and cool atmosphere. The place has a cool mural for you to take selfies! I highly recommend this place if you want a healthy fulfilling meal!"}
{"text":"Second time in this week! Had a wrap and came back today and had poke bowl. Their hibiscus tea is also good."}
{"text":"I've been on a Poke-kick for the past month or so since I discovered the stuff, so I was very excited to see this place come up on my radar when I was nearby yesterday.   The place overall is extremely clean with a nice bright, open feeling inside. It has a very Poke-place feel, and I really liked their colorful decorations.Their menu board and cash register area were very well done and high-tech, which I thought was cool.   Pricing was very good for the quality of food and serving size - I'm used to paying $10+ for a medium (2 scoop) bowl, so less than $9 was a nice surprise (especially for the pile of food I got!).   There were plenty of options for each of the steps (rice, fish/protein, toppings, sauce) and everything seemed really fresh, even coming in later in the day. Also, I LOVE the fact that they don't charge extra for any of the toppings (usually avocado, Masago, and some other toppings are an additional charge at other places).   The employees were extremely friendly, like over the top friendly but in a good way. They even came over to our table and offered my wife and I some samples of their new spicy crab and sauce.   I will definitely come back here very soon and I am excited to have another quality Poke place nearby."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while, and finally got a chance this week! The fish was fresh, the veggies and sauces were all awesome, and there are a lot of options. Portions are good sized and a great value for the price. Staff is really friendly and helpful. I hope I get to go back soon!"}
{"text":"If you have never had Poke before, this place is somewhere you should check out. I've had Poke before and this place is definitely on par to the places I have been. However, I do want to say that the one thing that was different about this place to other Poke is the option of getting lettuce as the base instead of rice.  If you do want an original type of Poke it's definitely the rice and a bit of soy sauce. I mixed up some sauces considering they had so many different type of sauces.    I came on a pretty much empty store and it was pretty straight forward, They have a large menu, you choose your protein, size of the bowl, and then basically go down the line. The avocado amount that they put in my bowl though was a little weak (see picture), but otherwise that small detail everything was fresh and tasty. The portion size was also pretty massive if you decide to go the rice route so if you want the size, that's what you should get. Definitely check this place out if you want to try out Poke and see what it's all about."}
{"text":"Area was very clean, and food was fresh. The price for what you get is fair in my opinion. I got a medium fresh salmon bowl with a green tea for about $10.00. Kudos to the employees they are very nice."}
{"text":"First time here today! Amazing & delicious. I  am a fan of the room design, very open & comfortable! The staff was very friendly & gave great suggestions. Even offered some extra dressings to try with my meal! I went with a medium Poké bowl, my friend had a chicken teriyaki rice bowl! Yum! Must stop in!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely fresh and tasty. Portions were plentiful and the price was on point. I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Having had poke in Hawaii and a few other cities, I can honestly say Poke Catchers is one of the better places. Portions are generous, no need to pay extra for items like guacamole, and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"So good. Incredibly fresh and filling for very reasonable prices. I moved to the area recently and plan on making this place a staple of my diet.   Tip: get the seaweed salad in your poke bowl. It is so, so tasty."}
{"text":"clean, relaxing, and good prices for the amount of food you get. Reminds me of when I lived in Oahu. I recommend to those that are fans of poke. After they put your main choices on, they let you load up on Kimchee, seaweed, edamame, tofu, etc. simple and great, come try it."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with friends. The set up is similar to other poke places. You can pick 1-3 meats and rice (white or brown), salad, or both. Then, you choose your sauces and your toppings. My friend is highly allergic to sesame and they were really nice about checking everything for her and making her a special sauce just for her that didn't have any sesame in it.   I ordered the spicy tuna and the salmon on brown rice. For sauce, I mixed 2 together the honey miso and the spicy aioli.  I ordered the majority of the toppings such as seaweed salad, avocada, masago, ginger pickles, green onion, tofu, crab mixture. The meat and toppings were fresh.  They give generous portions and I was pretty stuffed when I was done eating.   I also ordered the hibiscus iced tea to drink and that was super good. Highly recommend getting a tea.  I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times now when I'm downtown for meetings.  Both times I found a clean, well stocked poke line with fresh ingredients.  The people working behind the counter are friendly and will help with ideas if you have questions.   I'm a fan of salmon and tuna so usually my go-to's.  I found the fish to be fresh and good quality.  Love the topping selections and I typically like to mix a few sauces to create my own taste sensation.  Here I mix traditional and honey miso."}
{"text":"AMAZING FRESH FARE! I am a sushi hunter everywhere we go and just ducked in here for an emergency salmon sashimi fix...  HOLY SMOKES!!!!  My new GO TO for a healthy sashimi meal.  Great flavors. Constantly fresh and delicious food that doesn't break the bank. And you bounce outta there feeling fantastic! Wish I could give it 500 stars!"}
{"text":"I've only tried a couple poke places this one was pretty good. The place was very clean. I had the tuna and spicy crab. It taste fresh and a lot of healthy choices of toppings. I also had their pins colada smoothie which was delicious"}
{"text":"Great Fresh Food with fast convenient service.  I love the proposed combo's but it's fun to build-your-own as well!"}
{"text":"I swear this is my all time favorite place to eat. Being the fact my parents used to own a sushi restaurant and I love all things Poké. There is always quality fish and meat, the place is always spotless and the prices are SO reasonable. Being a model and beauty queen poke catcher is my life saver. PLEASE TRY. Also the employees are so sweet and how aesthetically pleasing is this layout?"}
{"text":"An excellent find.  I worked in Hawaii and this certainly reminds me of the poké I consumed there.  The staff is super nice.  They explain the process.  You pick your base of white, brown or spring mix greens or a combo of both.  Then pick your protein; 6 choices.  Pick your sauce, again 6 choices.  Lastly choose any or all 14 of the toppings.  We took rice and greens w/salmon, spicy aioli sauce, avocado, cucumber, edamame, ginger pickle, masago (fish row), sesame seeds, and seaweed salad.  Hubby had basically the same with ahi instead of salmon.  Delicious and freshest ingredients.  Plenty of parking.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the owner lady was super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Every time I come here the employees are so friendly and it's always clean! The poké servings are generous as well. The poké bowl is not ridiculously full of rice unlike other places. The meat is fresh and full of wonderful flavor. There is an abundance of toppings to choose from as well. They also offer Thai tea and it does not disappoint either. Every time I ever come here I have the same wonderful experience!!  Customer for life and wish they'd open in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Amazing poke! Portions and selections are plentiful and the taste is outstanding! There's another one in the neighborhood (Ahi Poke) that is truly missing the mark next to this place. The owners are delightful, too. I can't say enough good things... did I mention the ingredients are FRESH?! Take a look at the \"hidden\" reviews too - they're all positive, and I have no idea why they're not automatically visible. My new favorite neighborhood spot, and if it wasn't close, I'd happily drive the distance!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for Poke! The spicy crab is so delicious and they give you big portions. The team working there does a great job to make you feel welcome and to help make suggestions too. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good place still finding their footing with customer flow but don't let that keep you away. Some unorthodox choices for meats fish and they were generous with extra sides of sauce. Wish them much and long term success... Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best poke I've had in Phoenix. They give you a lot for your money and the workers are so sweet! It has a great atmosphere. Prices are cheap but food is great. I will definitely be back! Love this place."}
{"text":"It's a small shop but everything there is fresh and tasty. I got a bowl with salmon and tuna over brown rice & salad with almost all of the toppings and spicy shoyu sauce.  Guilt-free flavor with every bite. Mmmm mmmm... Great clean eating at 55 cents less per bowl than their competitor ($8.95 vs. $9.50 at Ahipoki.)"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  My friend ordered me two protein with rice to go.  And this is what I got! Litterally, tiny scoop of avacado, very small portion of salmon (not even fresh), and everything else on it.. TINY portion!!  Basically i got bowl full of rice!  I have been to many poke places  around the valley, and this place is sits on bottom of my list.  Never ever going back there again.    I gave it 2 stars because \"aloha lilikoi passion\" can drink tasted good. Everything else thumbs down!"}
{"text":"So let's review . I love this place . Reasons. 1. The amount of food you get is outstanding. They say 3 scoops but they stack it up   . I've gone here more than I like to admit  . Spicy Crab , Tuna and Salmon combo is so good , you will come back as many times as me. Great servers and you can get a card that will let you get a10% to 20% off each visit and I filled out one of those punch cards and got another one so trust me when I say it's addicting good food . 9 bucks If you go 3 scoop and you will be full till the next day . Lov3 this place"}
{"text":"Love how this place looks. Super clean, food is fresh, workers are friendly and good options!"}
{"text":"So unique and such a great experience for a late evening dinner. Perfect balance and great selection. Cute and very clean and the owners are very helpful for a first time Poke experience. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Ahi Tuna, Spicy, Salmon, Crab, Tofu, Rice, Fresh Vegetables, Delicious Sauces and Toppings, Wraps.... A Perfect and Healthy plate with everything You want, because You can choose between 1 and ALL the ingredients available! Faster impossible, As soon as You finish the Order, Your order is ready!! AhiTuna and all the flavors, make me remember last trip to Hawaii.. Coming back every time in Town!!"}
{"text":"Excellent location, service, and food. First time having Poke (yes, I don't get out too much) and loved it!"}
{"text":"We were craving for Poke & we definitely are satisfied now!!! Awesome selection, good prices, friendly customer service, and ONO! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Prices are low and the food was fresh and Delicious. Conveniently located next to the st Joseph hospital in a walkable distance"}
{"text":"Wow!! The food was tasty and a really good price. Best of all, the place is Paleo friendly. We had the salad bowls -- generous portions of fresh spring mix, ahi tuna and spicy tuna. There are a wide selection of fresh toppings, like edamame, seaweed salad, spicy cucumber, avocado, and more. The server was super friendly and helpful. Please try this place; I want it to do well and open even more shops!"}
{"text":"Great poke place and great service! The only downside is that there were not as many selections for seafood!  Nevertheless, the two selections I got (spicy crab and salmon) were delicious!! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered: 3 fish poki bowl (salmon, spicy tuna and tuna) and chicken teriaki bowl  Overall review  1. Fish is very old and mushy (salmon was mushy and I found a raw of what looked like chicken piece in my spicy tuna) 2. Teriaki plate- chicken also old and flavorless and sauce tasted like oil and sugar. 3. My mom and I had food poisoning after   I'd hate to write a review like this but it's very necessary in this situation. the restaurant owners need to be aware and should start serving honest fresh food to prevent customers from getting poisened. After eating our plates (I couldn't even finish all mine because of how mushy the salmon was and when I  found something raw in my spicy tuna made my stomach flip) we went home and suddenly the bloating began. My stomach was hurting. We woke up the next morning and my mom fainted twice and she had diarrhea. As for me I also felt faint and ran to the bathroom as everything came out. Now I love poke and I've had it in so many different places before so I know the difference between fresh and old fish. Please be aware, I've written this for your safety."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for our routine date night.  This place is by far one of my favorite poke spots in AZ!  The gentleman behind the counter is super nice and super helpful.  Must try if you're in the downtown Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Good ambience, friendly staff, and delicious food. Nice selection of fresh food and healthy toppings like avocado and masago and brown rice and green salad base."}
{"text":"yooooo these guys got it going on. two things that are always worrisome at Poke places are the 2 P's: Price and Portion. Two things that aren't worrisome at Poke Catcher? The 2 P's: Price and Portion.   another thing that was a really pleasant surprise were these bomb marinated cucumber things. Essentially a pickle but with the seasoning and spice to match up with the lovely, soothing flavors of its beautiful fish.   Anyways, if you enjoy life and don't want to be a miserable human being who has neither a future nor redeeming qualities, I would recommend opening your eyes and trying these guys  Definitely coming back here over another certain poke place a couple blocks away that i wont name now."}
{"text":"I arrived to my hotel famished after a long day of travel. Pretty much my only requirement was delivery. I stumbled across this restaurant and ordered a massive amount of food. And it was phenomenal. The flavors were amazing, the quality was perfect and the quantity was generous. I was so hungry I don't even remember what I ordered but it was all amazing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best poke bowl around and very affordable!  Yum.  2 items is plenty to fill you up while saving some $$$$.  Been here a couple of times and it's fresh and quick and easy"}
{"text":"Amazing Food!  I wish it was closer to my home."}
{"text":"Great poke!  Lots of flavor, generous portions, especially of meat.  Really enjoyed the beef and the tuna.  Just the right amount of rice.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Delicious and very friendly and welcoming!  This was our first attempt at Poke here on the mainland and stopped here on a whim.  Fresh fish, great selection of toppings and helpful services Ted that explained everything!"}
{"text":"The food tastes awesome! Reasonably priced!  One con is that the topping portions are smaller than I'd like. I'd definitely come back here again.  The employees were kind. Over all it's great"}
{"text":"I'm shocked by the 5-star reviews for this place. I love poke and this is the worst poke bowl I've ever had. Maybe I just went on an off day, but the fish wasn't fresh - at all! I couldn't even finish eating it. Gross!"}
{"text":"I was craving Poke on the way home from shopping. This place was near and just what I wanted. Delicious and refreshing. The wonderful woman who helped me said that they made everything in house. Sauces and all She even gave me some great advice for which sauces I should try and mix. And she right. Honestly, I have had better Poke, but the customer service was so great that I will be back again. Oh and try the Hibiscus Iced Tea, also made in house."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the BEST Poke places I have ever been. Great place, very nice and clean. Staff was very helpful. Food was AMAZING!!!  I had the Spicy Crab salad, which was amaze-balls, Salmon and Spicy Tuna.  LoveLoveLove"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Staff was awesome ! And they had great gluten free options for sauces !!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  This is hands down, the best poke experience I've had in Phoenix.   The place: The place is a decent sized establishment, modern, super clean, and it a pretty good location; uptown Phoenix where you get a lot of the business peeps in downtown/uptown area. Atmosphere is quiet, good for when you want to get away from the office for a bit.  The service: I came in on a Wednesday, 12:30pm, and there about 5 people eating there. There was only one person in front of me ordering, and I was helped right away. They were super friendly.  The food: I love that they have size choices! Small, medium or large bowls! I hadn't seen this at any other poke place in Phoenix. The large was less than $12.00, and it was a very decent portion, 3 portions of protein. I got Ahi tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna. They also have a variety of sauces, and my favorite part: they mix the protein IN A SEPARATE BOWL WITH YOUR CHOICE OF SAUCE! To me, that's what's up! The fish gets the flavor from the sauce, and it's delicious. They have a variety of toppings, pretty much what you see at all poke places, and to be fair, the serving of toppings is smaller than other places, BUTTTT, all toppings are included; YES! ALL! Even avocado, and crab salad, and seaweed salad.  After eating my large bowl, I was stuffed, def satisfied w/ the portion, the flavor, and the experience.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Just amazing! Why go to a Japanese restaurant and get a roll fir $15 when you can get a whole delicious meal for less! Tastes amazing!!! Includes a salad or rice base, salmon and ahi sashimi, seaweed salads, and so much more!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this family owned business 3x in recent weeks. They service there patrons with excellent customer and people skills. Poke catcher is an wonderful option for healthy eating with o fresh fish, produce and outstanding salad dressings. Finally there prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food! Affordable prices!!!  Ahi tuna was delicious. All fresh ingredients. Highly recommend. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The staff is always very help and makes great recommendations on how to create a delicious bowl that will blow your mind.   It is very refreshing, the options are all great together. If you need help there are preselected bowls to choose from. I like making my own, though.   I highly recommend this place. If you are in the area or live downtown, make this is a regular spot to pop into on a busy day to continue eating healthy and enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this poke shop as I was making my way towards downtown Phoenix and I must say what a great place.  I usually don't expect much but everything was excellent. Great service that makes you feel welcomed. It is also a great price for a poke bowl.  Plus it was delicious , I was more then satisfied with Poke Catcher. I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I can't stop raving about this place.  I love sushi and poke, but every time I've been to a poke restaurant, I can't help thinking that the prices are outrageously high for the portion size.  I've finally found a poke restaurant where I feel like I'm getting a great deal.  I ordered the \"large\" bowl, expecting a reasonably-sized small meal.  Turns out large means large at Poke Catcher.  It was priced at $10.95, which is about the same price of most medium bowls at other (disappointing) restaurants.  I received a HUGE portion of ahi tuna and salmon, tossed with the traditional sauce mixed with the aioli, on top of a combination of lettuce and brown rice.  I layered onions, avocado, crab, chili flakes, crispy onions, spicy cucumber, edamame, ginger, green onions, tofu, fish eggs, pineapple, jalapenos, sesame seeds, and seaweed salad on top.  Service was excellent as well, as was the matcha smoothie we ordered for dessert.  I was actually full at the end of the meal, which I've never been at any other poke restaurant.  Goodbye to all the other poke restaurants - Poke Catcher is where it's at.  I wonder if they have a loyalty program..."}
