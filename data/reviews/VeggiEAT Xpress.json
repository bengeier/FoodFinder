{"text":"Inside 99 ranch market. So worth it. Best vegan food in Vegas, made fresh after you order. Made with love"}
{"text":"Convenient off Stephanie/Warm Springs lots of parking, I ordered chicken curry and fresh watermelon slush. Curry's flavor is perfect ..green beans, tomatoes and vegetarian chicken slices and noodles  Order taker is very friendly and knowledgeable of food allergies...will be back"}
{"text":"GREAT TASTING FOOD! All plant based. Vegan and Gluten free options. Good prices. Good portions. Good service."}
{"text":"Vegetarian fastfood with great desert. Must try their milk tea! All \"meat\" are vegetarian imitations, great for vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"Best vegan sandwiches by far, located inside the 99 Ranch Market. Get the vegan chicken sandwich, it's the best one. Really friendly  customer service, almost everything on the menu has vegan options upon request."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the vietnamese beef sandwich.  I usually order one or two to go for work lunches during the week.  Crispy carrots and jimica, lettuce and cilantro, spicy mayo.  Yum. Also am addicted to the chinese chicken salad appetizer.  The sesame dressing is delicious.  I wish it came in an entree size.  Very filling and tasty.  Since its getting cold out, I am slowly working my way through all the soup offerings.  The ginger duck needs a bit more spice, the duck is nothing to write home about. However the glass noodles (I think that's what they are) are very light and not pasty.  I tried the won ton soup.  It was very tasty and filling.  My only complaint is there were tons of noodles and by the time the broth was gone, the noodles were soggy and pasty.  I eat here twice a week on average.  It is not very busy, but the waitstaff are very friendly and helpful.  Yesterday, I noticed on the menu that this location is 100% vegan, while the Las Vegas (Maryland Parkway) location is vegan as well as dairy vegetarian."}
{"text":"They are so kind and welcoming! It's inside of the 99 market. Yes, inside the grocery store. So, if you got lost looking for it - go inside the asian grocery store with the big 99 on it. Lol I had the hot wings and wonton soup; I swear to you this food is bomb! I brought my non-vegan friend with me and even he said it was really good.   They even gave us a delicious free sample of basil tofu with rice (I mean don't expect a free sample of anything, but still I thought that was cool!)   They have so many options, you're bound to find something to knock your socks off. I have a high tolerance for spicy food, but from what my friend told me, if the label says it's spicy, the label isn't lying lol.   omg enjoy your asian cuisine - some of the food may appear to be TOO realistic, but I purchase the same vegan 'meats' online and it's amazing what can be done with some wheat gluten & soy. If you have any allergies, please let them know beforehand. Check out their menu online! You won't regret your visit, fellow plant-based eaters.  Peace, love, and happy eating."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out. I got a veggie \"chicken\" curry dip with French bread. The curry had an excellent flavor. We ended up getting two free veggie  egg rolls for checking in. The egg rolls were very good with a nice filling. Also had an excellent  Cantaloupe Boba smoothie."}
{"text":"I've become a regular to this place. It just keeps getting better and better. The egg rolls are extra crispy with textured wrap and great flavors and spices. Mushroom udon has a savory almost light gravy sauce, and the noodles thick and soft. Enjoy coming to find new additions and menu items."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a nice light lunch. The menu has something for everyone. They have honey walnut shrimp that is simply amazing. The shrimp tastes exactly like shrimp. Made a believer outbof me and a customer for life. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent, the cleanliness is shining through. There located inside the Ranch 99 supermarket. My first item that I tried was a vegan Wonton soup. It is a large portion of hearty healthy and clean tasting soup, loaded with delicious Wontons, mushrooms , and other vegan treats. The bowl of soup is quite satisfying. It has amazing taste. I went back and tried there spicy eggplant. It is a stir-fry filled with flavor, and loaded with chunk's of delicious vegetables that scream taste. It is a large portion with lot's of eggplant , served with white rice, I love it , and has become my regular filling staple . This is a great! Fast food Chinese Vegan stop. You will be delighted by real Chinese, Phillipibe and other Asian families that go to the market, it is quite a cultural experience."}
{"text":"Great area tucked away in a small shopping center. Service was subpar as we did not receive water until we asked for it. Some people were waiting for their food a lot longer then we were. There were No menus in the front when we were standing in line. We had to order our food before we sat down which I don't mind but wish they put their menu up front so we don't feel rushed when we get to the cashier as the cashier provided us with our menu options when we reached the front. The food however was really great. I had the sweet and sour chicken and the potstickers ALL really great and it was worth the hassle in the beginning. Didn't like that we had to keep asking for water.  The guy kept apologizing hence the 3 star review as it was going to be a 2 star review. I will probably be back again to test out the service as the food was very tasty. And may update the review at that time!"}
{"text":"Love it always cooked fresh to order. Great staff, clean and close to home! Yay me!  I am only three months completely vegan and loving every bite that I've had a cyst place I've been here about six times and never had a bad experience..the desserts are amazing if you have room!"}
{"text":"Just bought the spicy lemon grass soup, the broth is surprisingly hardy. Service was great! Very helpful.  Got to do a little grocery shopping while I waited. I will definitely be back..............probably tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant and people here, the food is very healthy and tasty. No guilty at all! LOL' My favorite is tomato noodle soup. Also like the ginger duck noodle and mushroom sandwich. Sometimes they customized the stir fry veggies for me, very delicious and home-made style. People are so friendly. Highly recommended~"}
{"text":"I got a the beef footlong thinking i will eat all which I typically do at places like subway and surprisingly I got full half very tasty subs don't be fooled by the looks!!!"}
{"text":"I like the decor of this place. Staff and chef are very friendly. However, I've been here twice and both left me disappointed. The eggplant with tofu entree and the spicy beef noodle soup are both very salty. We did request to see if they can dilute the soup up to make it more edible. The staff was very friendly enough to help us out. But the result is still the same. I'm sure there are other items are tasty but I'm just afraid to order any after two bad experiences   5 stars for the staff  But 2 star for the food"}
{"text":"The best in town!  A hidden little gem of Vegetarian /Vegan delights.  Victoria P. has created a venue that serves up some of the BEST healthy food Las Vegas has to offer.  The Hot and Sour soup is fantastic.  The Fried rice is a meal that's non-oily, fresh and filled with veggie goodies.  Love the no fish \"tuna\" sandwich!  Spicy basil eggplant is delectable.  Yummy spring rolls with veggie shrimp.  We give Veggieat Xpress, along with Victoria, 5 big stars!  Can't wait to return.  Bill and Javier."}
{"text":"Hands down this place has the best vegan food in town. I tried  the lamb with zucchini and black pepper.  Let me convey in one word..\"deliciousness.\" I could not even tell from the texture that it was not real MEAT. Flavor was throughout every single mouth watering bite. Able to enjoy a cuisine that is healthy,.along with being cost effective."}
{"text":"Fantastic food Great service Owner came to our table and introduced herself to us We went To their new HENDERSON location We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great food Great service  I'm a diabetic and the chef cooked a wonderful sugar free meal for me"}
{"text":"Spicy lemongrass soup was yummy! Bbq beef sandwich was good. Free Vietnamese coffee with check in was a nice touch !"}
{"text":"Try this place out ! It's new and so good! My partner took me here bc he knows I'm tryna eat healthier and he had come here before with his friends. The staff is super friendly too.  It's advertised as a Vietnamese and Chinese vegan and vegetarian place so you'll see dishes like pho and banh mi, veggie fried rice etc.  Parking is in a lot so it's super easy.  The dishes were averaging around 7-8$ each.  I had the eggplant tofu and it was good- not salty at all and super fresh tasting and the portion was actually perfect. I didn't finish it tho and took leftovers home. The tofu was cut up nice and big and the eggplants weren't overcooked.  My partner had the walnut shrimp- it was so good - I think it was imitation crab- it looked a little like shrimp lol but it isn't. It was good tho.   I ordered brown rice with my dish.  How it works:  First you find your seat, then order at the front counter and pay for your meal. Then they bring it to you.  It's actually super convenient because then you don't have to wait for the check- and can just leave when you're done. Don't forget to leave a tip :)  Def. coming back when I visit the partner."}
{"text":"Great food as well as great customer service. We will always come back all the way from Texas -Ashes Smoke Shop : Denton Tx"}
{"text":"Good vegan food..lot of choices...I ordered Singapore rice noodles super delicious..good service"}
{"text":"This vegan kitchen may be very hard to find, at least on Maryland Parkway. It is inside 99 ranch market, and the lights are not always on even when the store is. Beyond that, if you like Chinese food and you want to eat vegetarian (or even if you don't) you have to try this. We swooned over their pho and potstickers when we needed a bite one night while trying to do some food shopping. Then we chose to go back for takeout on our last night in Las Vegas. It's that good."}
{"text":"So this place is wonderful. The food is absolutely fantastic, but what really stood out was the service. Our server Jason was super helpful and really made our experience here memorable. We loved everything about this place, but Jason made it shine. Thanks!"}
{"text":"It's all about the bread.   Located adjacent to a bakery, these sandwich rolls are about as fresh and soft as you could possibly get.  My date and I ordered two sandwiches - the Veggie Beef and the Mushroom. We also ordered the Purple Sticky Rice wrapped in a Lotus Leaf.  The sandwiches were tasty and filling - though I'd prefer more spice overall - more pepper slices, more cilantro, etc. The veggie beef was fine but unexceptional. I haven't had real cow beef in decades, but from what I can remember, this doesn't taste anything at all like cow. (Which is fine with me, but if you're expecting something beefy, you might be disappointed.)  The rice dumpling was also fine in an interesting kind of way. Glad I got it, but nothing to write home about.  I will definitely return to try more options. The soup looked particularly good."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, I ordered the small size BBQ pork sandwich which is vegetarian of course. I ordered the small size but my main problem was that there was hardly any of the\"meat\" on it. There was one thin slice and the rest was lettuce and like a French bread type roll. Also the menu was pretty small, I was hoping this place would be like Veggie House and have vegetarian versions of Asian dishes, they had only a couple of those and they didn't seem like anything unique, shrimp fried rice or sweet n sour chicken or something. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I tried the vegan meat combo pho. Pho broth is very light since its veggie based. Noodles were good. Vegan meat was weird for the most part. All of them had an odd aftertase. The seafood ones has the least taste. The vegan beef was not good.   Quick attentive service. Clean restuarant."}
{"text":"Delicious... I love the veggie fried rice. The dumplings are also pretty Good, actually everything I've gotten from here is pretty good and I eat here often since there aren't that many vegan meal options near me."}
{"text":"I ordered the orange chicken and fried rice ,both were delicious . The price was quite reasonable for the large portions . I look forward to going back .  Sammy"}
{"text":"Vegan Spicy   eggplant  Basil  Tofu. Hot fresh and delicious. A nice sized portion with rice. I highly recommend this place. Free wifi. Great looking iced teas I'll try next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie potstickers and Thai tea boba and it exceeded my expectations! Glad I found this place near my house. Can't wait to try the rest"}
{"text":"Since I was introduced to this Vegan eatery I've eaten here every week. My favorites are the beef chow fun, the mushroom with thick noodles & not on the menu, the veggieat lettuce wrap with two kinds of meat and pickled veggies.  The owner Victoria is very nice and loves to meet her customers. Kim was very nice also. Great food and great staff! A must try.   Feb. 3, 2018 This is the second time I ordered their sushi.  Only available on Friday's and Saturday's. I ordered 3 rolls. They were a bit pricey but DELICIOUS! They were sooo good. Best vegan sushi I've tasted."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times when I leave the ladies at the cash register say, \"see you tomorrow!\"   The pho is on point  Service is always good  Try the string beans and veggie fried rice   Almond milk Thai tea"}
{"text":"YUMMY!  Whenever he is hangry for a Bahn Mi this is where hubs wants to go.  Honestly this place reminds me of Veggie Delight here in Vegas (Chinatown) as far as the menu. Similar flavors also.  Almost all the items can be made vegan.  Hubs loves the mango slushie with boba. I have tried their Thai Tea but TT, but I don't like sweet, so my opinion is null and void on that item.  My favorite item here are the Fresh Hand Rolls. Hey who can go wrong one those?!!? Yummy!   I have tried their Singapore Noodles and they are super duper yummy. I am oil free now so I won't be reordering that one unless I can ask for no oil.  My favs are the curry (which doesn't seem oily) and the string bean dish.   Hubs usually gets a Bahn Mi and I have tried them before but being a non bread fan I pass one those.   The service is EXTREMELY nice the young ladies always happy to see us and the owners have spoke to us several times."}
{"text":"Never before have I stumbled upon a vegan restaurant that serves its delightful dishes with such elegance and professionalism. I thoroughly enjoyed each course to its fullest content as every bite ensured a heartwarming smile upon my face. Also, the interior is REALLY cute."}
{"text":"Spring rolls!! I love spring rolls with peanut sauce and they are great here. Also will be back for the Thai tea which was better than normal Thai tea with milk."}
{"text":"I typed in \"healthy food\" on Yelp for a quick lunch and this appeared within 3miles. Decided to check it out and loved it. Im OCD with almost anything especially my food prep and the Vietnamese sandwich I tried from here tasted really fresh. I love Vietnamese sandwiches so I know which ones hit my tummy good. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Have to say this is a Go To place to eat! It's always hard to pick places to go, specially having friends who are not vegan. But they also enjoyed a great meal from this place. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there today with a friend for lunch.  Absolutely delicious! Staff was *very* attentive and informative. Got the potstickers, (which I had ordered for the both of us but ended up eating all by myself as my friend was too slow...or maybe because I eat too fast, who knows!),  the big (foot long) chicken sandwich, and a Thai iced tea w/ boba. Most items are vegan (clearly labeled on the menu), the rest is vegetarian (due to dairy ingredients). I was told none of their items contain egg ingredients, in case anyone is highly allergic. NOTE: as of this writing, they're currently cash only until their credit card system is up.  A terrific addition to the Las Vegas valley's already great vegan restaurant selection."}
{"text":"Love this new spot! I'm giving it 4 stars because I think they still have a few kinks to work out before they reach perfection. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The interior is clean and modern. And most importantly, THE FOOD IS SO GOOD!! We got egg rolls, pot stickers, sweet and sour chicken, and honey walnut shrimp. All the food is plant-based, but not everything is vegan--this distinction is not clearly marked on the menu and can be confusing. There are small updates that will make a big difference--napkins on the table, water refills, etc., but overall, they are doing a great job and still getting their feet under them."}
{"text":"Over all service is good, Once they were pretty dead and they closed 45 mins before , next time when I went I got sick with food poisoning . Have stopped going there now ."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday. The Asian hostess who greeted us was not very helpful and seemed annoyed when asked questions about the food and restaurant, since it was our first time there. The food was decent and priced fair. The food was a nice alternative to American Vegan selections in Las Vegas. Our waitress was nice and helped us with our food selection.   We found out that they do not accept American Express credit card even though their website states all credit cards are accepted. I believe it is UNAMERICAN not to accept American Express. The website needs to be corrected as it can be conceived as false advertising."}
{"text":"So good!!! I had their chicken (vegan version) fried rice and it was delish!!! And the meat substitute looked, smelled, and tasted like chicken! We were amazed! Charles and Ivy were so sweet and helpful. Definitely recommend if you are about that veggie life"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. I was visiting from California and was so happy to find this vegan restaurant. The girl at the front was very welcoming and greeted us promptly. I believe this restaurant is new so as soon as she greeted us she handed us our menus and explained which items were vegan and which were vegetarian or had meat. The vegan egg rolls were amazing! I also had the vegan pho And the green tea w/boba! Super good! I'll be back when I visit!"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious vegan sandwiches! If you're questioning trying anything vegan, I'd definitely recommend any of the sandwiches to start. The food is consistently delicious. The mushroom udon is also very tasty. I highly recommend this place to anyone curious to try. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and is four stars.  The portions are very small.  None of the entrées came with rice and it had to be purchased separately. We ended up spending $80 on four people.  The service was two stars.  The server was always confused about what table they were serving.   It took a long time to get orders in and we had to request our bill after a long wait."}
{"text":"The staff set us down gave us water and never came back to take our order after sitting there 10 to 15 minutes we left without ordering they also had some very annoying music"}
{"text":"Decent food have a variety of choices and fast service,  i like their Vietnamese sandwiches and also the soups"}
{"text":"The best Vegan restaurant in HENDERSON by far!! Tons of choices on their menu! And everything on the menu is vegetarian prepared!! Excellent food"}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I begin? The service was phenomenal, the food was delicious and the place was clean! What more could you ask for from a restaurant! If you have never had vegan food this is the place to try it. Like they say, don't knock it till you try it. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in delicious food that is healthy too! We couldn't have been happier with our order of the vegan pho combo and vegan spring rolls. We joined their rewards program and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've gone here 5 times and loved this place each time I've gone. They have really good smoothies and their sandwiches are huge. And I think they're starting to sell sushi now so that's a plus"}
{"text":"Best veggie/tofu pho in town! I love ordering the veggie pho, even if I wasn't vegan I would still go here for the pho. I pair it with my favorite Thai tea boba made with soy milk! :) I'm in here quite often for take-out and not only is the food delicious, but the staff is also super friendly! I've also tried the cheesecake and it's so close to the real thing, I couldn't believe there was no dairy in it!"}
{"text":"Veggieat Xpress is the latest food counter to open in the food court Ranch 99 Market on Maryland. Menu is similar to Veggie House on Wynn, but it's unclear if they're related.  The best deal here is the $7 lunch combo- fried rice or rice noodles with your choice of two entrees. The spicy eggplant tofu is good with large chunks of lightly-fried tofu, and the flavor of the \"chicken\" curry is decent, with a solid sauce but an overwhelming amount of potatoes. The tofu could use more texture and the curry would benefit from more spices, but it's a huge portion for the price, and filling veggie meals usually aren't under $10.  Rest of menu is veggie-fied Chinese and Vietnamese dishes, including bahn mi- the \"fish\" sandwich is under $5 and the \"shrimp\" will be the next one I try. Their soups seem to be what they're known for, and the broths are surprisingly full-bodied. Check for daily specials and new menu items posted at the register.  NOTE: They take credit cards to the kitchen to run them? My receipt said I paid cash when I did not. Not sure what's going on but I'm not a fan of my card being taken out of my sight."}
{"text":"Poorly organized, but very polite. 2 stars  Waited long time in line, since they didn't have a menu available. Every person in line complained about the limited 2 printed menus available to order. Once you reached the cashier, you felt hurried to order even though you had no clue what dishes were available.   A customer was told he could grab a menu, sit down, and come back when they knew what they wanted. The same customer and his son left after 10 minutes, as the line had grown longer. It was sad.  Once My friend and I got to the front of the line, I ordered a spicy lemon soup,as i didn't have time to look over what else was listed.   My friend got the pot stickers, sweet and sour chicken, and brown rice($3 extra).   Taste 4 stars:  Lemongrass spicy soup was delicious. Generous portion, the soy meat is very tasty.   Potstickers 4 stars- mushroom filling   Sweet and spicy 4 stars- tasty   Message to management: have a large menu available for customers."}
{"text":"First of all, YUM! Boyfriend and I got a couple vegan sandwiches and they were so tasty and filling! The menu is expansive and the prices are extremely reasonable. I wish I lived on this side of town because I'd honestly be eating here religiously.   Not gonna lie, this place was a little tricky to find... until I realized it was in the grocery store! DERP!"}
{"text":"Really cool this new place caters specifically to Vegan and Vegetarian community. But everyone is welcome here and guarantee non Vegan/Vegetarians can find something to like here too!  I really liked my veggie sandwich and \"shrimp\" spring roll, tasty meat substitute. But the menu is pretty ordinary. Your basic sandwiches, soups, spring rolls, that you can get at any of the Asian cuisine restaurants in the area minus the \"meat\" option.  Other than being \"vegan\", I didn't see anything that stood out. Yes the sandwich is a large size, but mostly bread, the main part, the veggie filling was not enough. Thin serving.  I felt bad cause I felt I wasted food, leaving so much bread after I ate.  Spring roll was good as well. Prices are reasonable, and pretty much in line with other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great vegan options!!! Friendly staff! Food tastes amazing.. the pho is very tasty... and the sandwiches are very crispy.."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place. It's a Asian fusion food stand inside of 99 Ranch Market. Their menu consists of mostly Vietnamese food like your usual pho , vermicelli , and banh mi. Everything on menu is vegetarian/vegan , even the meats. If you're familiar with Veggie Delight or Veggie House (both on Spring Mountain) - they're a lot similar to this place. The counter service was extremely nice. The gentleman working there highly recommended me their beef banh mi out of their many menu options. The regular size banh mi is HUGE , in photos it looked a lot smaller so prices are not too expensive compared to the quantity/quality you get. The sandwich bread was bit too thick for my liking but overall the banh mi had great flavor. Good meat to veggie ratio - the vegan beef was super tasty and I loved all the crunchy veggies (daikon , carrots , cucumbers , lettuce , etc.) inside :))  I ordered the egg rolls seeing that they have the bubbly crispy skin that I like & Thai tea w/ soy milk to-go. Their Thai tea was amazing ! I usually steer away from Thai tea at Asian fast food places but here it tasted like legit Thai tea & a bit more \"healthier\" than other Thai teas since it definitely wasn't too sweet. I also appreciate how clean this place is. Now if they made their smoothies/slushies with real fruit rather than just flavored ice & also offered brown rice/whole grain options then this place would be perfect. I will definitely be back to explore their other food items."}
{"text":"Very clean, excellent customer seevice, cute ambiance, large portions, food is phenomenal! And I'm not even a vegan, but I don't eat meat anymore. The sauces are delicious! Only problem is, I might be here all the time. Lol Wonderful food!!"}
{"text":"First time at this establishment based solely on Yelp reviews. It's a new place on Stephanie St. and Wigwam right next to the Circle K Gas Station.  It's a very comfortable and quaint place that offers healthy food. Although a Vegetarian and Vegan place, the food taste so delicious without any hint of plant or tofu based meats. Made fresh with flavorful ingredients and spices, this place boasts of quality service and comfort.  I will definitely come back to this place with gladness and it's a highly recommend place to everyone. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Pretty good, the prices weren't bad and the food was yummy. I really liked the asparagus and mushrooms"}
{"text":"Great vegan options! Great food for lunch and dinner. I come here often and the food has always been delicious. I would recommend the Vegan Chow Fun, it's a must!"}
{"text":"Oh Em Gee! I had the chicken sandwich and it was the bomb.com! I will go back and try other menu options. Looking forward to my next visit. Sandwich was so flavorful! With every bite my taste buds were having a concert. I was not too impressed with the Boba drink as I don't think it was made with real fruit. I ordered the cantaloupe and it did not look like cantaloupe. Although I wasn't really paying attention when they made it, I don't think it was real fruit. I will try to ask if they do or pay attention next time."}
{"text":"The place is super clean. The staff is helpful warm and informative as well as patient in case you're not used to vegetarian and vegan foods. I ordered the beef chow fun and it was fantastic!! You wouldn't know it's not meat. I loved it. The food is flavorful the potstickers were oh so good. The owner was there and she is a gem. Makes you feel like you're sitting with family. We will definitely be back here. Hands down the best vegan vegetarian restaurant in vegas! And i can't wait to try their vegan/vegetarian Sushi!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, clean restaurant. Thank you Julian for the excellent service!  Great vegan options!  Will be back to try more !!:)"}
{"text":"What a great night! I didn't know where to go tonight for dinner until I saw Angel's post on the local vegan Facebook page! Her and Sensei really know how to do sushi and I'll definitely be back to try the regular menu next week."}
{"text":"Popped by on Meatless Monday to check out Henderson's newest vegan-friendly spot. I've been to their other location on the East side and this one has the same menu but with a strip-mall location (instead of a food court). It's an upgrade in setting without an upgrade in pricing, which I can appreciate.  That said, while the menu has a variety of Asian noodle, soup, and sandwich choices with fake meat products, I was a little underwhelmed again. The sauces, like in the chicken curry, are solid, but all of their sandwiches are on bread that is so thick that it is offputting. Bahn mi aren't known for being packed with protein but when 80% of my bite is bread, I'm not a happy camper. The \"chicken\" they use here is not my favorite, the texture is a bit off, but I do enjoy their \"shrimp\". It's a great find for vegetarians and vegans but omnivores may not find much to like about this place."}
{"text":"My sister and I came in on a Saturday for dinner and were delighted when we were handed sushi menus. This was a great treat because vegan sushi usually means cucumber rolls or veggie tempura.  The menu was impressive, mimicking signature rolls you see at sushi restaurants.  The Korean BBQ Rib Rolls stood out.  I will never turn down a mock KBBQ dish.  Additionally, we got the Rainbow Roll and the Tempura Jalapeno Beef Rolls.   The rolls were beautifully presented.  Our favorite was the KBBQ Roll.  The entire roll was panko-crusted, fried, and topped with a jalapeno slice.  It was better than I was expecting.  The Tempura Jalapeno Beef Roll contained the same mock beef in the KBBQ Roll, only this time it was topped with a tempura fried jalapeno.  It made for a real mouthful.  The cucumber inside was crispy and refreshing.  The Rainbow Roll was a decorative, gigantic masterpiece.  It seemed like a sampler roll with a variety of ingredients.  To wash everything down, I got the Thai Tea with coconut milk.  Sushi menu is only offered Friday and Saturday evening from 6-9.  Service was top-notch.  We were checked up on by three different employees.  Ample parking and we were seated right away on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service was great to. I went to try the food and I found the menu had a lot of tempting choices. I got beef lemongrass pho and I loved it. I got the spicy basil stir fry and it was also good. The lady who served me was very nice and pleasant to interact with. Will be back every time I am in Henderson. I will try the Duck pho next."}
{"text":"Loved the fresh mango smoothie, and the tomato rice noodle soup. The egg rolls I wasn't huge on, but not bad either way."}
{"text":"So happy we tried it out! Amazing food & great service! The BBQ \"pork\" pho sandwich is incredible!!!! Fresh yummy vegan/vegetarian food is rare to find while eating out, this place is awesome! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"We've stumbled upon this place after we received an ad email from Yelp. And oh boy what a gem this place. The food is simply amazing. If you're a vegan or a vegetarian, you must try this place.  It's located inside the 99 Ranch Market, and there are no signs on the outside. Just walk into the market and make a left.  The owner is so nice. She even gave us free  Fried Dumplings which were great.  We ordered the Vegan Beef Pho, the Vegan Wonton Soup, and the Tomato Rice Soup. The Pho and the Wonton soup were my favorite. We will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"For all the vegans and vegetarian out there. This place is a must. The Vietnamese sandwiches are so delicious also tried  the sour spicy rice noodle soup,wow!!. The family that runs the restaurant are so nice and friendly. Cant wait to go again"}
{"text":"good central location. food is tasty and they offer milk tea with soy milk.  the only issue i had was they should label the mock meat that is GLUTEN and GLUTEN free."}
{"text":"Bad service, and slow, slow, S L O W. Since I was only ordering boba tea, I thought I could get out in under 10 min. Didn't happen. Ugh. Well, surely at least the boba tea is good... meh."}
{"text":"Ordered Thai tea with almond milk, Singapore noodles and peppered lamb dish, the dishes were delicious and the portions are large. Also enjoyed the atmosphere! 5 stars from this vegan! Can't wait to go back and try the rest."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this restaurant.  We walked in at 8:30, fully knowing they closed at 9. We were on our way to a movie, so in a bit of a rush ourselves.   We were greeted at the door, and then the hostess looked at the server who was already cleaning, and the server literally moaned and said, \"but it's already 8:30\"... The hostess asked if we could please order take out instead. I said \"no\". And she also whined, \"but we close at 9\". I said, \"I know that, and I've also worked in restaurants,  and I know you still seat people 30 minutes before your closing time\".  I was in no way trying to keep these ladies from staying at work late,  but 30 minutes and they couldn't serve us, and the moaning and groaning? Nope.  At that point they realized they should probably let us stay, but we had no desire to so we left. I was a server in college. I get it. They wanted to be out of that door at 9pm. That's also why I would have made sure we ordered right away, to speed along the process.  We eat out all the time, and we respect our servers. But to have someone moaning at the fact that you showed up to their restaurant 30 minutes before you close, when we probably would have come back many times? Unacceptable.  Needless to say, we went across the street to a different restaurant, who also closed at 9, and when we walked in they said \"Welcome! Have you been here before?\".  And yes, we were finished eating and on our way to the movie by no later than 9:10."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant and I had a great first experience! I had General Tsao's, cauliflower style and the Sesame Crunchy Shrimp Roll. SO GOOD!! Employees are great!! My new fav spot!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice while I was in Vegas over the weekend. The wait is a little long but food was delicious! I got the beef chow fun and some shrimp and broccoli dish with a white sauce on top. I have never had vegan shrimp before but that dish was amazing! Can't wait to go back and try some more of their menu."}
{"text":"This the 3rd time ive been here, its the perfect spot for me after work with good amount of vegan options. They even gave me the free egg rolls for checking in even after they changed tye free item to milk tea.great overall customer service"}
{"text":"Opened recently. Excellent food even if you aren't vegetarian. Very tasty and healthy Pho. Great Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Much better than the new location on Stephanie. Convenient to UNLV and located in the pristine new 99 Ranch Market, VeggiEAT Xpress is a casual spot for tasty vegan food. The menu has a large selection and I have tried several items on multiple visits. Bahn Mi are tasty, curries and other dishes were well spiced, and the service was very good. The woman at the counter took time to explain they make everything vegetarian but can make it vegan if you request. They have an assortment of boba teas and drinks available as well. Not the fastest, but worth the short wait. My delicious and friendly experience here lead me to try the new Henderson location. I hope they get that spot sorted and it doesn't cause this University gem to fold. Check out the bakery next door for dessert!   Thanks for the tasty food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So, go to the 99 Ranch location if you want to try it. The service here was rude, and pretty incompetent (we ordered two entrees, to go, and after 30 minutes of waiting for Singapore noodles and curry, we were asked if we wanted one or two sets of silverware, for TWO PEOPLE with TWO ENTREES).    First of all, there's nothing \"Xpress\" about anything here. It's a full on sit down restaurant, very unlike the food court location on Maryland Pkwy, where I have eaten a couple of times and had good experiences. We arrived expecting a second location similar to the first, mostly take out focused.   Oops, wrong, made an ass of me and you by assuming. The name is Xpress, so that's misleading, and with a smaller menu thats all like regular take-out type food, we figured it would be a quick to-go type situation. Our order was taken by a very irritated woman, I guess she hates working there and hearing what food you want is too much, she shouted at us \"NO RICE!?\" because my girlfriend had just asked for a chicken curry, and hadn't asked for rice yet (who charges for rice with curry??). There were THREE whole tables of folks eating, one got their order while we're waiting, one was eating, the third got their check. 5:30-6:00pm on a Saturday, the only other dinners we saw were two more pick-up orders, and one poor guy was still waiting when we left. It's noodles and bahn mi and curry, it should not take long.  As to the food \"quality\", we received bland Singapore noodles with about 4 - 5 ratty little tofu pieces, and the worst curry I have eaten in a long time. The watery, palm oil filled mess was afloat with awkward and haphazardly sized hunks of what I estimate to be a big roll of tofurkey like delis use for veggie turkey sandwiches. Aside from that odd quarters of tomato here and there bobbed along a few incredibly uniform green beans (like frozen bag of beans uniform).  TLDR; pass. Veggie meats are subpar, tofurkey quality. There are better places in town for the same price without a 30 minute wait or rude service. The cashier/hostess was chatting with some business partner at the hostess stand the whole time we waited. Then the \"sushi chef\" came out to also have an extended, very audible conversation with this woman about how ignorant diners don't want to try his sushi because they dislike fish. \"It's not fish, duh!\"   Never again. I will check out the 99 Ranch spot again, maaaybe, but yeah save yourself the trouble here. It may be good if you've never had good vegan food, or good service, ever.   This was the first time food and service have been so disappointing that I've felt compelled to write a negative review. A review at all, actually. For fairness I'll leave a positive review for the other location."}
{"text":"VeggiEAT Xpress is a great choice for Vegetarian/Vegan folk. My favorites are the Buffalo Wings and the Beef Chow Fun."}
{"text":"I have eaten here plenty of times now since this place has opened & am really liking it!  When they first did opened they had a few hiccups, as to be expected. What really impressed me was how the owners handled it and were so kind.  This is located close to home, so it's very convenient when I'm hungry, want to order vegan easily, and get in and out quickly.  They have a lot of options on the menu, and I have yet to try the sushi. Looking forward to that as well!"}
{"text":"VeggiEAT is in the food court of 99 Ranch Market. There's plenty of parking, but beware of the less able drivers nearby! The food court is very clean but you still get a slight hint of smell of the seafood section nearby. As for VeggiEat itself, the food was great! Although I'm not a vegetarian, I do enjoy eating it. I ordered the Spicy Beef Stew Pho which was very spicy and salty. However, that is exactly how I enjoy all my food, so it was perfect for me. With the prices being fairly priced and a new location opening up closer to me in Henderson, I will definitely return to VeggiEat Xpress!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  The cashier was very friendly and the food was delicious. Wanted to try what the locals have access to. Was not disappointed!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My fav place for egg rolls, I love that it doesn't matter I only get a half order they add some salad"}
{"text":"Awsome food, comfortable seating, great service. Best vegan food in Henderson. Prices are reasonable and the location is very convenient."}
{"text":"First time trying vegan Vietnamese food. Everything I expected from the vegan pho happened! I got veggie spicy lemongrass pho, veggie egg rolls, and spicy basil chicken with white rice. I couldn't make up my mind so I got it all! The staff are VERY friendly. I ordered my meal to go and it look less than 10 mins for me to get it. Fast, delicious, and warm hearted people! Highly recommend and will go back to try other menu items! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is located INSIDE the 99 Ranch Market. Counters were kept clean, menus were easy to read and there were tons of vegan and vegetarian options including sandwiches and pho. The food was prepared in the back so expect a wait time for your order. I ordered Vegan chicken nuggets and fish, and here's the verdict- Vegan chicken nuggets: Taste and texture of real chicken nuggets. They're a bit pricey, so for that reason I'll only get these again for a treat. Vegan fish fillets: The \"skin\" is made of nori, giving them a more authentic flavor. That said, the meat itself tastes identical to the chicken nuggets, but are a bit chewier. The meal came served on a bed of white rice with steamed broccoli. This order was very filling and worth it for the price.   Based on my experience I will definitely return here to try more of their vegan food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, I been over 10 times lol I try different things on the menu only one item I wasn't too happy about so now I kind stick with I'm usually item I get lol, sushi bar will open soon there how awesome is that"}
{"text":"We had a large group (10-12 of us) looking for a good lunch spot on a Sunday afternoon. I think we slightly overwhelmed the staff of 3 but they did their best to accommodate us and answered any questions we had about the menu. And we had a lot! Since it was our first time and there were so many things we all wanted to try, we ordered several items and shared them between 4 of us. We ordered the curry French dip, walnut shrimp, wontons, and the green beans. And a large bowl of rice (dishes don't come with rice :/ ). Each item came out a few minutes apart, kinda weird, and every time a dish came out the server would basically announce it to the whole restaurant trying to figure out who it belonged to. Also kinda strange, which is one reason I gave 4 stars. But the food was hot, fresh and delicious. There is zero meat products served. Even the shrimp was not really shrimp but taste wise and texturally was just like real shrimp. The green beans and the walnut shrimp were definitely my favorites! My only other complaints and reason for the 4 star rating is the portions are small for the price, especially considering they don't come with rice.  A few at our table ordered boba drinks. They were yummy too. The staff are eager to please and even made a special sauce for my friend who has many dietary restrictions. Overall, I was very satisfied with this place and will most certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Great little supermarket food court restaurant. If you are vegan, every single item here works for you. Service is attentive and food is delivered quickly. Food has great flavor. Definitely stopping by when in the area."}
{"text":"(VeggieEAT Xpress @ Henderson) This is now the only place that my partner and I go to for soup and other vegetarian/vegan meals. I have lived in Vegas long enough to know where to get excellent vegetarian Pho, and this is it folks. You just have to go, sit, and eat to appreciate what they offer. Vegan meat never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"So, before I sound particularly mean or picky, just hear me out. I've been a vegetarian for 10 years, I've eaten Vietnamese food, Chinese food, Korean food, etc. I've had faux veggie meat on multiple occasions so I thought that I knew what I was getting when I ordered my food.   I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG.   1. Veggie Orange Chicken: The faux chicken was very skimp and the pieces were do thin and salty. No breading and about 75% consisted of chunky unseasoned vegetables and orange slices. The sauce on the orange chicken didn't even taste right. This dish tasted NOTHING like orange chicken! And half of the container was rice....  2. Veggie Buffalo Wings: The sauce on the wings made this dish inedible. It tasted nothing like a Buffalo sauce. In fact it was extremely tart and vinegary! It was so vinegary that it actually hurt your tongue. My friend literally had to rinse the sauce off to even eat it (because it was smothered in the crap) oh and BTW this dish was $10 for 5 inedible wings.   3. Veggie Dumplings: This was the only palatable thing that we ordered. And honestly they were RATHER bland.   If you are really craving Asian food and you are a vegetarian than do yourself a favor and go to Veggie house Vegetarian restaurant. At least your food will be edible there."}
{"text":"I waited 38 minutes for mushroom pho, and then it was so bland. Not quite sure why this place has such great reviews, I will not be returning. Service was very friendly and working hard, which I appreciated as I waited forever for my food. I just wouldn't go here if you're on a time constraint or if you're a meat eater you will most likely find the food bland."}
{"text":"Super, super good. And I'm not vegetarian or vegan. Their banh mis are some of the best I've had (favorite is the \"beef\"). Bread is super fresh. Always. Their service is attentive and friendly. Five stars, all day."}
{"text":"spent $32 on everything I ordered which included veggie egg rolls, they weren't tasty at all. Idk what they put in there but I almost threw up. Their fried rice was decent, the peanut oil they used in it had a pretty strong taste. Their BBQ veggie port sandwhich was decent but they should have toasted the bread like every other place would and they only give you four small slices of the veggie BBQ pork so it's basically all bread. MAYBE I'll come back for their pho but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"this place is a gem for vegetarians :) good tasting food, reasonably priced, big portions! the staff was very friendly. we had the wonton, spicy beef pho, the fish, and the rice in lotus leaf. all A+! it's kind of in a food court looking area, so not the fanciest and dont expect it to be that clean or the tables to be bus well."}
{"text":"I stopped here after getting some gas next door and seeing the sign. As a Vegetarian, I always am in the lookout for a restaurant that offers me a full menu of options. I decided on the Veggie Beef BBQ Ribs with black bean sauce and a side of brown rice. The flavors were incredible and it came out piping hot. The appetizer of the buffalo wings were also delicious. Crispy, with a side of medium spice sauce.   I also washed down the mean with a delicious Vietnamese Coffee which was flavored perfectly. Not too sweet and not insanely strong.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent lunch tried the \"chicken\" curry. Very flavorful! Also enjoyed the pho soup. I'll be back."}
{"text":"So good!! I mean everything was amazing. Very fresh. Friendly service. So glad we chose this for our vidit"}
{"text":"Best Veggie Sandwiches ever!!! The restaurant is inside the 99 ranch market. The tomato rice noddle is very tasty too!!! Would defiantly come back again!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy Singapore noodle dish and half way through a bug came crawling out my bowl."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm BAAAACK!!! Had to try this place again. This time I ordered their buffalo wings, tofu eggplant and oreo cake. All vegan. I am NOT a fan of the tofu eggplant meal. It didn't have much flavor and not sure what the juice was but it felt greasy. Won't order that ever again. The buffalo chicken was pretty good. It is a nice replacement for the real stuff. Nice sauce etc. The oreo cake was good too. Nice way to quench my sugar desire. Overall it was pretty good. I like the food I ordered last time a whole lot better. Could just be what I chose but not overly excited this time......think I might stick with the egg rolls and Singapore noodles. Sandwich too. I'll be back some other time for something else."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food and yelped vegetarian Chinese and this place showed up. I thought.......\"HECK YES GET ME SOME EGG EGG ROLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSS\"!!!!! so I ordered veggie egg rolls (of course), veggie chicken sandwich and Singapore noodles. Mmmmmmmmmmm. Ok so the place: it was clean, welcoming and really nice. Not to big. People were very friendly and even had some tips for other restaurants besides them.... (vegetarians stick together). Egg rolls: I have one word for them \"YUMMY!!!!! these are just add so addicting and the dipping sauce is such a great compliment to them. I will be ordering them again. Veggie chicken sandwich: it was pretty good.....a lot if bread....not much faux chicken.... no chicken taste but the veggies and spread were pretty good....just a lot of bread. Don't get me wrong the bread is REALLY GOOD but it's a lot. Singapore noodles: I think it's one step away from being AWESOME!!! I think it needed more curry flavor. Some spots had enough and others left you thinking \"did they not mix this together?\". Seriously 1 step away. I would go back for sure. Would definitely order the egg rolls again and dip them in that sauce and ask for extra sauce. Would try different items next time. Good Job VEGGIES Xpress!!!"}
{"text":"This place is inside the 99 Ranch Market next to Marshall's.. They have PHO soup among sandwiches, smoothies, egg rolls.  All Vegan.  Made our day and the food is great."}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience lunch was.  I wasn't sure of what to order.  Our server was so kind and patient.  The Curry Tofu with stringbeans was absolutely wonderful.  My friend had a cold salad dish from the appetizer section.......she loved it. Everything is cooked to order (no reheating of items). The place itself is so pleasant to be in...very light and the decorating is so tasteful.  The cleanliness of the place is so apparent.  Everything is visible.....no kitchen behind closed doors.  The employees (chefs) are so pleasant!!  I can't wait to come back.  There takeout service is very popular.....I counted at least 18 people who came in and ordered items to go.  This was in a half hour timeframe.  Also, I love Sushi and that is served Fri. and Sat. from 5 p.m.  What a wonderful addition to the restaurant corridor of Stephanie St."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service. Prolly a great location for college students & priced fairly, too. Always great to have more vegan restaurants.  Lemongrass pho was very \"meaty\", pretty good, but not as freshly flavored/veggie heavy as we are used to.  The spicy eggplant wasn't half bad. It wasn't really \"spicy\" to me (And I chose very spicy), but YMMV.  We would go back & try more menu items, especially if we were in the area, but wouldn't go out of our way again just yet."}
{"text":"Thanks to What The Health I've been vegetarian moving towards vegan for about a month and this place makes it hard to miss Dairy! I've only tried the soups but the pho is amazing and the wonton soup as well, I love all the options, can't wait to try everyone of them!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and we always try something new. All their food is delicious and I was excited when they switched to a full vegan menu. Their vegan sushi is amazing. Definitely recommend the rolls (not the egg rolls, the other ones. I forgot the name.) Their mixed fried rice is delicious and they don't use garlic or onion which surprised us when we were told. The Walnut shrimp was amazing, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"In town visiting family and doing this amazing tasting Vegan place. I would highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The sandwiches, the curry, the BBQ rib, the general tso, you name it! Everything is awesome! They even have a sushi chef on Friday and Saturday nights. The sushi is absolutely awesome. I have not had sushi this good since becoming a vegan. And finally Wasabi without eggs. Staff is friendly, reasonably priced, excellent food. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always amazing. I've never got something I didn't like. Even my meat eating friends love it. That says a lot! And Julian one of the waitresses is always so sweet and accommodating. I definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden inside the 99 Ranch Market, which is behind IHOP.  Kinda hard to see from the street NE corner Maryland and Katie.  It is totally vegan except for the 20% of dishes that uses dairy.  That was what Victoria, the owner, said.  Very creative menu and friendly people.  I ordered the \"fish\" and veggies that Victoria recommended.  It was on the dry side and could have used a sauce or something, but other than that, the fish was amazingly created from tofu and sea weed, and even tasted like fish!!!  They're open till 9pm every day, a great go-to place if you're near the Strip and looking for a reasonable vegan eatery.  Go!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out. I got the mixed \"meat\" pho soup which was a little bland, so I wound up doctoring it up at home. I would recommend considering the add-ons! I also ordered pot stickers and fried dumplings which were good except the fillings were exactly the same as far as I could tell. I'd call this place good, but not great."}
{"text":"Finally, amazing vegan food in green valley! Everything is fantastic. Victoria the chef and owner is amazing and so kind. Family owned and operated and open 7 days a week. I can't wait to bring everyone I know here and share their passion of healthy eating."}
{"text":"A clean and cute spot with plenty of Vegan options. Had the Lemongrass soup, it was a big portion, very tasty and spicy."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan restaurant! The BBQ pork sandwich was amazing. Tasted just like real meat, but it's all vegan friendly. Will definitely be back here to eat."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic variety of vegan dishes. Mushroom and vegan duck pho were great as well as taro boba!"}
{"text":"I had no clue this place was here for so long. Lucky I'm always searching \"vegan\" in Yelp and I found it! It's located inside of a super market, which I like honestly because I can pick up a few things while I'm here. Ha. I got the stir fry eggplant. I don't handle spice well, so they kindly made it mild for me. It was delicious. I'd definitely get it again. I wish I took a picture but I was too hungry to think. I plan to come back for the yummy looking soups. Another plus to it being in the market is that it's in a food court with other options, so any nonvegan friend or family don't feel like I'm dragging them to another vegan spot again. Haha. I'll be coming back here on lunch!"}
{"text":"Nice hidden little place right across from the shell station! I ordered the veggie shrimp spring rolls and the potstickers. The spring rolls were very fresh and the veggie shrimp was so tasty! The peanut dipping sauce was perfect as well. However, the potstickers had me torn. The taste was there but I guess I just prefer my potstickers to be crispy on the outside and these were not. 10/10 for taste 4/10 for texture.  Overall, I'd definitely come back to try their other options. They have so many options for bahn mi and pho and to top it off, they have boba!   Ps: their credit card system is up and running now but give them some time to get used to how it works! Super nice people over there (:"}
{"text":"Veggieat Express has great menu --for vegetarians as well as vegans.  Their veggie beef sandwich is one of the best!  I've also tried their vegetarian Vietnamese pho--it so satisfying and really affordable.  It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"This one of the best vegetarian/vegan restaurants in town.  They have flavorful food and very reasonable--'love the Spicy Lemon Grass Pho soup.  I've also tried their  Veggie Beef sandwich-- it's one of my favorites. This place is clean and bright inside."}
{"text":"The food here is good and I love that it's all vegan :) I had the sweet and sour chicken and lychee boba which both tasted good, except the boba was a little hard and not chewy like I would prefer. I got it to takeout so below is a photo of how the chicken looked!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here couple of times, obviously a 5 stars for cruelty free food. Their fried rice is really good. Also their sandwiches are pretty good. The only thing this place is missing is some fries & vegan pad thai. Perhaps a little more variety would be great."}
{"text":"I went in there today for the first time. The lady greeted me and my son so nicely and as we were sitting down the table she brought us a high chair and the menu. I ordered mushroom pho soup and it was so flavorful. I also got a vegan green tea boba and it was alright. The price was amazing and the portion size was pretty good too! I can't wait to try other items next time I am Henderson :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing pho, friendly staff that's so knowledgeable and full of recommendations. Also plenty of vegan options!"}
{"text":"I ordered the minced ground combo and brown rice with Potstickers and it was fantastic. Great experience and Jason and Charles helped me. Good service and food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.  The staff is friendly and helpful always making anyone coming through the door feel welcome.  Highly recommend VeggiEat Xoress."}
{"text":"Great vegan & vegetarian restaurant! The Pho was delicious as were the veggie egg rolls! Everything we tried was fantastic! Definitely gonna be a regular!"}
{"text":"Another all veggie restaurant with awesome food. Love the menu with a variety of items. Spice levels can range from mild to your liking offs spice. If you like spiiiiiicy food like me, they can do that."}
{"text":"I heard from the restaurant that the balance was due to the credit card being charged $13.96 and not the $16.13 shown on the receipt.  After checking the card, they were right!  I correct my review and change the rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome pho  currie veggie chicken noodle soup.  I could eat this all day.  Owner was very patient as this was my first time ordering pho."}
{"text":"Mmmm delicious veggie egg rolls I had me some for lunch . Oh! By the way! When using GPS Fir this place don't believe it on the end cause it's sending you to the back of this place so go around to the front of the plaza, thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since it opened in Henderson.  It has quickly become one of my favorite places!  I've tried at least half of the dishes and while I have my favorites, I haven't tasted anything I really wouldn't eat.    If you're in the Henderson area, do yourself a favor and stop by!   I don't give 5 stars often so you can bet it's a great place!  Be sure to give feedback when you are there so they can keep the business growing"}
{"text":"I have been to both of their locations. Henderson has more menu options but there are no bad choices. Everything they have ever made, are currently making, and will make in the future is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place. Totally glad I yelped it and came here with my buddy. Being vegetarian you don't always get many options. But to get options In a super market restaurant is great.  Let's start with the counter service. The workers are super sweet and quite helpful. They gave me good suggestions and my buddy too. He isn't vegetarian but they found him a great meal without wheat. Prices are good too. I got Vegan Chicken Nuggets and wonton soup. The wontons were amazing with fresh veggies inside. Wasn't crazy with the huge pieces of cabbage in it that were too big to put in my mouth lol. The wonton soup was good I wish it was spicier but I should have asked for that, plus it cleaned my sinus'. It's served in a MASSIVE bowl for like $7. The nuggets were served with an amazing peanut dipping sauce.  Did I mention they have Boba?!  All around this place makes me want to come back, come back and also do my groceries at the market and have dinner with them :) that's the impression you want when running a business! Thank you for the great food."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's been hard looking for a good vegan/vegetarian places. This place has bomb pop stickers, and delicious boba my person favorite is coconut. I really do e joy their soups, great value of the price feed about 2-3 people, and their vegan bbq pork sandwich is to died for. I take my friends who aren't vegan or vegetarian and they love it too."}
{"text":"This is a very good vegetarian restaurant. I recommend the ginger duck pho. Great flavor it's a good alternative to meat. Sometimes your system needs a healthy break. Try it!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best bahn mi I've ever had! The service is great and the space is extremely clean! Couldn't have asked for a better place!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  My friend recently started a plant-based diet and we decided to try this place out.  I couldn't believe that something meatless could taste like the real thing!  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I'm always in search of new Vegan spots in the Valley and was so excited to try this place after running errands all day! I ordered the Vegetable Pho, Veggie Stir Fry and Vegetable Fried Rice! Yum! I only have 4 stars because they were out of Taro and I was having a craving for it! We most definitely will be returning when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I had no idea about this place until i seen it on Ubereats!  Very yummy food! Taste so fresh and healthy.  I ordered the Veggie fried rice with Soy Bob Tea !!!!"}
{"text":"It's about time we get a nice alternative in this side of town!  I so far tried the beef sandwich and it was super fresh and yummy. I Can't wait to try the rest!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. This is my family's go to place now. They also do Perka points."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 vegan sandwiches and vegan egg rolls.  All excellent and the service was great.  The lady that took our order and services us was fantastic.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My husband was able to order online while I was running errands so I could just stop by and pick up our order which was SO convenient! No wait time, and they were so polite to help with the door as I had my hands full with two kiddos. Prices were good, and everyone was very happy with their dishes! The vegan egg rolls were a little tough, but that can happen when doing take out with fried items. I'd love to try them when they were fresh! Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"For all the vegetarians out there...let me just say props to you because I don't think I could be a vegetarian, but you gotta give me credit for checking this place out! I figured the food has gotta be good because of the reviews, but boy was I wrong :(.  I ordered the Singapore Fried Rice Noodle (very reminiscent of pancit) which was pretty bland and literally was just a bowl of noodles with a few toppings. I'm not sure why I had to pay $8 for this, but I won't make that mistake again lol. The noodles did have some spice and a slight kick to it, but I was expecting a little more flavor to entice me into finishing this dish. It literally is just carbs on carbs. I do wish they gave a bit more veggies or tofu...something to break the monotony and to justify the price.  I also got their almond milk tea with boba which was another big mistake. The almond milk tea didn't even taste like almond and it was so diluted! To make things worse my drink had so much ice in it lol. I only paid about $3-4 but c'mon...I get the whole maximizing profits thing, but don't dilute the tea and then throw in a bunch of ice into the drink :(. The boba was okay...didn't have much flavor to it, but maybe that's because I'm spoiled by Brew Tea lol.  Overall I would not recommend this place. It's decent at best in terms of flavor. The price point isn't that great either. It's a bit high for what you are getting. I also noticed that the Vietnamese sandwiches are going for almost $8 for a large size! That's ridiculous! I'm not sure I would fork over that much money to try it lol. If you are craving for some vegetarian food I would recommend Thailicious! I just went there yesterday and legit it was so good!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem   100% vegan  I'd recommend their buffalo chicken wings  Yellow curry  Mushroom banh mi sandwich  I'm excited to go to their restaurant location!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this little place and it's awesome! I had the Spicy Basil with Vegan Chicken and I LOVED it!! I had the level 5 spicy and it was very spicy! Just how I Like it. I will be back with my wife to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in Henderson or Las Vegas!  Upscale casual environment, and my meat-eating family adored the place.   This modern, clean restaurant makes truly delicious and creative Asian cuisine. The ambiance is very enjoyable, and they have delicious boba teas to try. Everything we ordered packs so much flavor. Any dish with vegan ribs or vegan beef has been a huge hit! The service has always been friendly and I'm excited to go back for a third time!  Such a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My favorite vegan spot in vegas!! Such amazing food, everything I've ever ordered was absolutely delicious and they have the most wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"This is a sit down reasturant.... not a quick and grab. They focus on ethnic food choices... so no hamburgers and fries here folks. So..... hmmmmmmm, the verdict is still out on this one? It's new... so I don't want to judge to harshly at this point. Let's go over my thoughts.   Parking is super easy and visibility of the location is good. When you walk in the place is big enough to fit a ton of people. They have screens up and boxes that need to be processed and put away! Not one of my favorite things to see.   Bathroom is clean enough... but you have to work your way through the tables and stacks of boxes in the hall way to get to it.   I wasn't  impressed with the inappropriate cus words in the rap song they had playing .... that that was kind of a turn off. When I sat down at a table the chairs sink in and we're super rickety! Most of them look like they're picked up from some craigslist posting somewhere... Dirty and unkept. The sign outside says they are just open?? This definitely doesn't seem like it's a brand new facility.  The sandwich that I ordered was good enough... Nothing really to write home about. And the Coke I ordered came in a can, with an offer to pour in a glass?? That was really strange and totally offbeat for me.  The waitress knew a lot of their menu and gave me some options which was nice to know, since it was the first time and I had been there I kind of wanted to get a feel for what they thought was the most impressive meals.  Oh and by the way they make their own mayonnaise... Which has a very sweet coconut flavor to it... Mayonnaise lovers beware.   I'm not completely dismissing this place, I'll definitely come back in a month or so to see how they do and maybe order one of the Thai soup dishes... That the couple next to me had! And that looked absolutely off the hook!! But for now, I will keep my two star rating for them and tell they can show me they've gotten their stuff together with a location in the food."}
{"text":"The employees are really really polite, they helped me pick out several items and the Vietnamese sandwiches were probably the best here in Vegas hands down, has lots of vegan options as well  Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Of course, I was looking for a lunch place and found this on Yelp. It was easy to find.  This is a very clean establishment with friendly people behind the counter.  Ordered some sandwiches and pho. Both very fresh and flavorful. Next time I won't get the jalapeños on the sandwich since those were too spicy. The pho had a nice broth and the noodles were delicious.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Another delicious dinner! I had the spicy tofu and eggplant with veggies. Also got some delicious pot stickers. I'm anxious to get hungry again! The friendly staff are always happy to please! This is awesome Vegan Thai food!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Our family dines here often. Love the sandwiches, the Korean BBQ \"ribs\" and the pho. All the servers are super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The service was decent but the cooking was off. A friend in our group and I ordered the curry lamb and the curry tofu. The sauce was very runny compared to other curry dishes I've tried in other restaurants. I also noticed how a lot of the dishes we had did not have much flavor as expected. To top it off the food left an uneasy feeling in the stomach. Not a good first experience"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! I order through uber eats and the time and food quality are all awesome! I'm a new vegan and love that I've found this place!!  I definitely would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Could be a little faster delivering food however their customer service and friendliness is on point. I would go back again because they are so friendly."}
{"text":"Hilariously bad food. Cauliflower was purely fried dough. No sauce. No quinoa in the $2.50 \"white rice and quinoa.\" My boyfriend's bahn mi had virtually no fake meat on it. Just a gross waste of money."}
{"text":"I love this place! Chicken wings are my favorite. This is the absolute best vegan food I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I just ordered 3 items from here. The 2 appetizers are really disappointing. The Singapore noodles are decent at best. I'm disappointed i wasted money on this. Won't be ordering again. Vegan food doesn't have to be without flavor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the staff is super sweet and they're always providing superb service and care. The choices in food are great. They've been adding more and more to their menu since they first opened. The location atmosphere is nice and well lit. I highly recommend their Veggie Curry."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious \"wraps\". I cannot remember what they are made out of but they are gluten-free and I had them 3 days in a row.  I found that may be a little less salt would have better suited me and when I mentioned it to them on my third visit, I was told that they usually sprinkle a little extra Himalayan salut when the wrap is on the grill. So I can just ask them not to do this next time and it will be super perfect."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwich and milk tea with almond milk. The sandwich seemed to be lacking chicken in it with only one very thin slice which didnt even reach all the way across the sandwich so you would get bites without any chicken in it. It was overall a good sandwich even though that second or third slice of chicken would have been nice. I will not count that against this restaurant though because it is a vegan/vegetarian establishment so I can appreciate the higher veggie to \"meat\" ratio."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how wonderful their food is. Sauces are absolutely delicious and how did they do fried shrimp vegan?? AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but damn I probably should be. This place reminded me of the very first time I tried a pho and bahn mi combo in college. It made an old experience new again by introducing my mouth to all the sweet and umami flavors I loved from my first experience, but this time being entirely meat free. My eyes could not correlate what my mouth was feeling. I ordered the bbq pork sandwich and the combo pho and every bite offered something unique and immensely satisfying. The bowl of pho was also astronomically large too. We needed two to-go containers to just pack one bowl.  My girlfriend got the grilled tofu sandwich (she's vegan) and it was just as great. The egg rolls were pretty damn tasty too!  Do yourself a flavor and try out this place."}
{"text":"So happy to see a vegan place opening here in Henderson. Will be back. Again and again.  I ordered the beef sandwich (vegan) and the veggie chicken salad (vegan). I would order both these things again. There were a few vegetarian items, mostly the fish imitation dishes like the tuna sandwich. Boyfriend got the pho combo which was really good too, had lots of different meats to try and the broth had good flavor - almost sweet. Also tried the strawberry boba. Good prices and portion sizes.   Only downside is that their credit card machine was down so cash only - a minor inconvenience and I'm not gonna take off a star for that. They were also out of papaya - the papaya salad was my first choice but went with the chicken instead."}
{"text":"I have only good things to say about VeggieEAT Xpress. All of the staff here are great. They're knowledgeable about vegan food and they are happy to ask you questions and make friendly recommendations if you can't make up your mind between two or more items. This place is one of my automatic go-to spots whenever I feel like eating out."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan food for a fair price and lovely staff with knowledge of the food. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So impressed with VeggiEAT. We were not sure what to expect and everything was amazing. We shared a Vietnamese BBQ sandwich (Bahn Mi), the bread, veggies and \"pork\" was tasty, the sandwich had a great, fresh crunch. We also had the curry chicken rice noodle soup, and it was spicy and so good. I've missed dumplings for years and they had a veggie version that perfectly hit the spot. The boba teas were a must too. You can eat in or take out, this will definitely be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"A bit of a challenge to find (I didn't know it was inside of the grocery store ).   Lots of great choices! The young lady behind the counter (Ivy) was great and helpful. The coconut boba was fabulous. The \"fish\" sandwich was good. Looking forward to trying other items."}
{"text":"Menu mostly consist of mock meat made of vital wheat gluten. The taste were very bland or overly powering. Didn't feel like we got enough value for the prices and taste. Spent around $130 for 3 adults, 2 children. Mediocre, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a long time and I really like it. Service at the counter was excellent and good recommendations. I had the Vegi Pho who was very good, but why not add some basil next to it? It will definitely add more flavor.  Got some dumpling as well who were delicious.. I did not care to much for the sweet rice wrap in Banana leaf and got more food to go for tomorrow night. Overall it was good and much better than a lot of Vegan place in Las Vegas. My litchi smoothie was delicious as well. I will be back even if I never go on this side of town."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Vegan alternative since making the switch. Yelp recommended and I went. It's inside s shopping market that has great produce and selections on international foods. I ordered the Spicy Basil Tofu Eggplant. It was delicious. I was not able to eat it all in one setting. It is a dish that can be shared. Excellent flavor and made fresh after it was ordered. I will definitely be back since it is so close to work."}
{"text":"Clean and relaxing, inside of a grocery store. Everyone was friendly! Taste like the vegan chinese food you get in California and thats a good thing. Good portion size. Not too big-Not too small. They have lots of fake meats. I suggest trying the buffalo wings. Next time I am going to try the Tomato Pho Noodle"}
{"text":"Having just tried to go the vegan route, i am so happy that we found this place. The food is great and the staff so is extremely friendly. Its   owner and cook, Victoria, is a master at creating new and interesting dishes. If you're vegan or even if you're not, check out this restaurant. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super good ! Not a fan of vegan meat but the vegan shrimp spring roll is AMAZING !! The sandwiches are also good. Would have gotten 5 starts except they said they couldn't make me a shrimp sandwich because it wasn't on the menu"}
{"text":"My first visit to Veggie eat was on Saturday 2/17/18 I ordered a mushroom sandwich regular and two eggrolls. The waitress informed me there were jalapeño peppers in the sandwich I asked her to please omit the peppers. After waiting a good 20 minutes I finally got my sandwich, before I left I said to the waitress there are no jalapeño peppers correct she said yes. I left went Home started to eat my sandwich after two bites guess what jalapeño peppers in my sandwich. I called the restaurant and told them that my sandwich on jalapeño peppers and the girl that took my order answered the phone apologize asked for my name and phone number and to come in and she will give me a new sandwich next time I come in. Went back two days later which was Presidents' Day and they were business.  I spoke to the person behind the counter And told her what had happened and she apologized and took my order. I waited another 30 minutes and asked if my sandwich was ready .  The person I spoke to was making lunch and serving tables. She told me because it's so busy if I would come back later or another day.  She refused to give me service because it was to busy at that time.  This place isn't going to be open to long if they don't get more help there customer service stinks."}
{"text":"The food is so good. I ate here a few times, however my last experience was kind of odd. I ordered the veggie pho and found two small insects in my food.. usually one doesn't bother me but as I was eating I found another. So technically my soup wasn't really vegan  anyway, I told the waitress and she was super apologetic. I really didn't want to make a huge deal out of it so I just asked for some spring rolls instead. 15 minutes went by and no spring rolls came and the rest of my table was finished with their food. My husband asked for them again, but to go this time, and then another 5 or so mins later, all I've eaten 2 bites of soup, I'm hungry and everyone else was awkwardly waiting for my spring rolls so we could leave. As we paid for the meal another woman explained to me that because their food is organic, there will be insects. Which is fine, except maybe just try washing your veggies before you cook them? So, anyway the icing on the cake.... I go home open the rolls and start to eat them and guess what? Another insect. I haven't been back since, but I'd like to go back because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I was on the complete opposite side of town last week when I did a yelp search for vegetarian friendly restaurants in the area. I stopped in to see what this place was like. I decided to order a coconut Thai combo with soy meat.  The cashier was friendly but for a place with EXPRESS in the title, it took awhile to get my order.  The food looked good, though, and I was excited to try something new.  Within about 1 hour of finishing, I became sick.  I literally had to pull my car over to vomit.  I was a half hour late to work because I had such a pain in my stomach and kept vomiting.  Once at work, I got sent home early because I was clearly unwell.  As a bartender, I missed out on about $400 that night.  I called the restaurant to explain what happened and asked for a refund.  I was told she could only refund my card in person.  This was not a worthwhile option for me, as I live far from the location, and requested a refund by phone.  I was told that she would get back to me, but no one ever called.  I called back today and this time the \"owner/ manager\" handed the phone over to some guy right in the middle of me talking.  He was no help at all.  I'm truly disappointed by their customer service. I will never go back, will never refer a customer, and will file a claim with the Health Department and BBB.  Shame on them.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"5 million stars. The staff goes the extra mile and the food is ridiculous. Seriously they're so sweet. They make all of their sauces themselves. Like hoisin & the hot sauce and the peanut sauce ..everything. I ordered Thai tea, bomb. Pho, hands down best pho I've had even prior to being vegan and my omnivore friend seconded that. Then there was the beef sandwich. YUM. We also got dumplings and that's when I just couldn't take it anymore and my heart broke from exploding from how f*ng delicious they were. I couldn't even get to the spring rolls. Had to save those for later but I already know what I'm in store for ;) yes !!!!! I couldn't believe how seriously good everything was and the fact that they are so genuinely sweet made me so much happier with eating there. Wow. Talk about hidden gem!!!!! It's in 99 ranch market if you have a hard time finding it ! GO NOW. I wonder if they are hiring because I just want to eat there everyday...... and figure out how they did this lol"}
{"text":"So excited to have a VeggiEAT near us! We had a few different options and the were all delicious.  Out of what we ordered the vegan beef yakitori, vegan pork banh mi and the fried rice are all amazing. 10 out of 10 will order again. Also highly recommend the Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"Their restaurant is clean, their service is fast and their food is delicious. But their prices are very high for such small portions. I ordered takeout of vegan Pho & fried rice just for myself. My total was 19$ & change it was ready right when I arrived which was earlier than expected so that was great, however for 19$ i was definitely expecting a lot more food. The Pho came in one small bowl I would guess 12oz? and the fried rice was in the smallest classic asian style cardboard togo box maybe 1/2 cup maybe 3/4? at that price point I expected there to be enough for at least seconds, however their wasn't even enough for me to get full :-/ None the less, the quality was fantastic and the service was great."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and the staff is super polite. The food comes oit super fast. We had the vegi buffalo wings which were fpod the sauce is spicy. The Korean noodles are fabulous. The vegi fried rice is great. The general Tso cauliflower is Delicious. We also had veggi tofu Pho. Which was flavorful.   We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was skeptical because I love meat. It's  solid asian food and flavors. And I'd totally go vegan for the mushroom dish! Soooo yummm! The service was good, and the price points for the quality of food were good. They prices are the same as you would pay at a normal asian food food place."}
{"text":"Yum!! This first-time visit here was excellent. I was greeted and served with superior service.   With bánh mì sandwich concepts on their menu, the Vietnamese staple item is done really well here. The baguette bread is light and crisp after they toast it and the veggies inside are extremely fresh and tasty. I recommend the mushroom sub (bánh mì) and the veggie spring rolls. The mushroom sandwich featured grilled mushrooms and they were marinated and tender before being grilled. Other accoutrements on the sandwich were cucumber, chopped lettuce, cilantro, carrots, and jalapeños. All of it had a nice crisp bite and paired well with the hot mushroom and toasted bread. What's even better was the price of only $4.50. The veggie spring rolls were made to order and also featured the freshest veggies with rice noodles and a peanut sauce for dipping. These were also very good, not quite as good the sandwich but still good. The decor and atmosphere of the place is inviting and well kept. Definitely a return spot!"}
{"text":"Rolls I got were too hard to eat, and I ordered spicy and it was about as spicy chicken ramen noodles. So if you like spicy stuff then better order very spicy."}
{"text":"Menu items there taste great--they're all a bit on the greasy side, but most of them are delicious. Especially the walnut shrimp, buffalo wings, and fried rice. If you're trying to maintain a healthy diet, I'd advice you to stick to the sandwiches as they come packed with vegetables.   The desserts are a bit too sweet for me to eat in one sitting, but they still taste amazing. I love all the cakes in the menu, and the smoothies are good too.   The one thing I really didn't like was the noodle dough. It has a gummy texture and a taste you quickly grow tired of. Sad, because noodle soups are one of my favorite things to eat at asian cuisine restaurants."}
{"text":"Loved this place. So good and tasty vegetarian food. Very hard to find a place like this. I wish they open one in Phoenix. I'll for sure be their one of the regular customer . It's a nice and clean place too. Also people of u r visiting this place for the first time FYI it is located inside the ranch market. I had to call them where they r exactly."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a vegan option for pho. I got the mushroom pho. It had several types of mushrooms along with you standard veggies. I recommended this, the broth was flavorful and everything very fresh. The staff was very nice. They had plenty of vegan drink and dessert options as well"}
{"text":"VeggiEAT Xpress opens their second location! (First location inside 99 Ranch Market). It seems like there's a new Asian or boba spot opening up in Henderson every other week and VeggiEAT Xpress just might be my new favorite. Not only is it really good, but there's also zero competition in this neighborhood (in terms of Vegan and Asian) so I have high hopes for success. BEWARE: Their credit card machine does not work yet, BRING CASH!!!!! The restaurant is fairly large, brightly lit and yes, they speak English.  Everything is vegan aka no meat! I listened to 2 customers come in and not understand that the chicken/beef/shrimp listed on their menu was not actually chicken/beef/shrimp.  Beef Vietnamese sandwich: So, so good. The large size is 12+ inches and huge for a single sitting. I would get the large though, because it's such a good deal!  Sweet and sour chicken: Not on their menu, but they serve it at their other location and you can order it here. The \"chicken\" has a slightly squishy consistency and definitely way more sweet than sour. Order a small white rice - $2!  Singapore style noodles: HUGE portion. Not very much \"meat,\" so if you're scared of the vegetarian protein I would start here. Thin, soft noodles with a small amount of vegetables. A little too heavy on the carbs for me, but as a side it's good!  I would highly, highly recommend VeggiEAT! It's a nice addition to Henderson and I'll be telling my friends about it!"}
{"text":"Had the chickn sandwich and the veggie pork soup. Both were very tasty and had very unique flavors This place is inside the 99 Ranch Market. The GPS may not give you the exact location."}
{"text":"When they first opened their doors I a happy customer. Food was great. Service was timely and accurate. Now they have new staff. While food has not changed, the service went so far down hill that I do not even want to go there anymore. Not only do they now get the order wrong, they make you wait till the order is corrected and then forget something else! A poor delivery service guy was waiting for his clients food longer then I was and they messed up my order. Had me and waiting for the new one. Got me my food. And only then did they make the missing smoothie the delivery guy was waiting on. I really felt bad for him because the client will blame him and not the restaurant. Today was the fourth order in a row of mine they messed up. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"I got the Hot and Sour Pho soup. It came out in hot and fresh in a big bowl, and it tasted great. They also have a special right now for 2 free egg rolls for checking in. The ambience is nice and relaxing for being inside a grocery store, very clean and new too.  I will definitely be back since it's so close to where I work!"}
{"text":"This place has some tasty Vietnamese sandwiches. I got the tofu and my husband got the bbq pork. They were a bit dry but very tasty overall. I really, really loved the warm bread. I almost forgot to say they have vegan dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!!!!! Wow!!!!!! This place has great food and service. We had the shrimp rolls and lemongrass soup, which were so tasty. If we could give a 10 we totally would! Must try vegan  spot"}
{"text":"food was great has the tgai tea which is not great everywhere but delicious here, also had to pea blossom lemon drink. tried the veggie pho wgich tastes very healthy its light not oily and taste very flavorful."}
{"text":"Very fast vegetarian and vegan food. Tastes good. Not too expensive. Better than fast food by miles."}
{"text":"First time here. The staff was so friendly and helpful. We ordered the vegan veggie pho, vegan beef sandwich, vegan egg rolls, and a vegan taro drink with Boba. Our food didn't take long. Everything was super delicious and the portions were huge. We will definitely be returning customers. Thank you VeggiEat for having vegan options and for being great to your costumers."}
{"text":"So happy to have a tasty vegan restaurant in Henderson! I just got a quick tofu sandwich to go on my lunch break. It was sooo good! But the restaurant is decorated really nice I can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"First time dine here after seen all the great reviews. I ordered the spicy lemon grass beef pho and the basil eggplant. The food was good, but a little less than we expected. Maybe we were spoiled by the abounded vegetarian choices in Southern California.  The basil eggplant is my favorite of the two dishes. It's a little bit heavy on oil though, flavor wise was very good. The beef pho just lack of flavor, the rice noodles were a little over cooked. Maybe the lunch specials will be better."}
{"text":"We are not vegan but we observe Meatless Mondays regularly and really enjoyed this restaurant. The service was great, the food was above my expectations & is bursting with amazing flavors!! Served piping hot and with a smile!!! The Tso \"Chicken\" (cauliflower) even fooled a meat eater like me!!  Look forward to frequent Monday meals there! I would totally become a vegetarian if I could make veggies taste that good all the time!!! Until then, we will be happy to eat at VeggiEAT Xpress!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We like the fact that they have vegan versions of so many of our favorite foods! Prices are reasonable. Staff is pleasant and nice. Ambiance is modern and fun. Food is terrific and portions are large. Get it for here or to-go or even order online and gave it delivered. It's good no matter how you eat it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The beef sandwich is really delicious! I tried the chicken one which was good but the beef one is the way to go. Everyone working is nice and helpful. Service is a little slow. It took 25 minutes to get my food."}
{"text":"Ordered via Postmates, can't wait to try it in person.  Beef Chow fun was amazing, have tried both the cheese cake and carrot cake and would recommend the cheese cake!  Highly recommend, good flavor!"}
{"text":"I have been to the other location on Maryland parkway , but I love this one wayyyyy more ! I forgot my servers name but she was wonderful and the food was delightful . The food came out fast and hot and it was freaking bomb . I also would like to note how good their matcha is ; super fresh :) will be back all the time !"}
{"text":"We arrived almost at closing time and they were great taking our order...They didn't hurried us up at all."}
{"text":"I love this place, this is the third time I ate here. The restaurant is clean, the waitresses are really polite, the food is delicious. I completely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We got the spicy veggie beef stew and the spicy basil chicken dish.  Forking delicious (pun intended)  I have tried several vegan/ vegetarian Asian dishes and this place takes the cake.   The food was to die for and even the boba is bomb! This store is killin the vegetarian game. Whether you're vegetarian vegan or a normal bro, you need to give this place a try.   Zamlicious"}
{"text":"What a great place, you will not regret visiting!! I'm a (vegan) New Yorker with family in Vegas, so I'm out there frequently, and always on the prowl for something good to eat. I often am disappointed with the vegan options in Vegas and find myself living on french fries and side salads. Not any more, this place served me the best meal I've ever had in Vegas! It's Asian fusion and there are lots of great choices. Everything was fresh and delicious, I have no complaints  (and as a former food service worker, this is rare). Definitely go there!! Don't let the name fool you, the Henderson location is a wonderful sit down restaurant. Their first location in Vegas, which I did not visit, is more of a grab and go place, hence the name. The owner was very nice and I believe that she gets to work in the kitchen in between visiting her guests at the tables. I wish her lots of luck because I look forward to going back! Go there now! I suspect that even non-vegan/vegetarians will enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good vegan food hidden in the back of a 99 ranch market. Lots of options but I would like to see a few more. The lovely lady up front says they are always adding new things and even gave me a sneak peek of the vegan sashimi that is coming to the menu."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was awesome and service was great. Great selection of Asian inspired meals with many vegan options. Resonably priced. 2 adults and 5 kids for 50.00 is pretty good and we are all full."}
{"text":"The food here is good and nice portion. They make avocado smoothie but don't have avocado I'm not sure how that works. It is located inside a market just Incase you get lost. I won't return but it was definitely worth the try. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian place. I've had the spicy tofu eggplant with rice the first time I tried this spot and it had me coming back. I've been here three times now within a week since it's reasonably priced.  It's also super lowkey and chill which is a plus!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The food is wonderful and they have LOTS of choices. We ate here once and instantly became regulars! The Vietnamese egg rolls are to die for and they have vegan Thai tea! The service is always wonderful too!"}
{"text":"VeggieEAT Xpress earns a five star review from me.  My dining experience yesterday left me with a feeling of WOW!  The dining area was neat and clean with a modern feel. Our server was attentive, friendly, and energetic.   This was my first time in so there were so many menu items that I wanted to try. I finally decided on the vegan ribs in black bean sauce.   The dish was amazing. The vegan ribs were perfect, great texture and flavor. There were vegetables tossed in the black bean sauce as well. The black bean sauce was flavorful, so tasty.   Will definitely be back to try other dishes and of course get this one again."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. The staff was very accommodating with my wife's meal. The chef even came to the table and spoke with us about our meal. They even have vegan sushi nights. The pho was to die for. This has quickly became my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok. Definitely vegan. Service was a little slow for us being the only ones they where serving. Had the veggie wonton soup. Broth was probably da best part. Wonton just different. I say try once at least for yourself. Hard to find if not no in Asian grocery shopping center"}
{"text":"What fantastic food.  The place is so clean and the staff is wonderful.  It's family owned and the Mom has the best Vegan cooking I have tasted.  I will be there whenever I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"had the mushroom pho and it was delicious  will definitely come back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Came to henderson and was looking for a vegan option! Im so glad we found this place! The Pho was really good and they give you a big portion. I also ordered a Thai tea and my husband ordered a Vietnamese tea and they both were so delicious. We definetly will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"The good: fresh food, lots of variety, good parking, clean interior, friendly staff. I have been here three times now, for lunch and dinner, and while not every dish was my favorite, most of it has been really tasty and good quality. The prices are reasonable. I love having so many different and unique vegan/veggie options.   The bad: popped in for a sandwich today. My partner and I each ordered one. He got his first, and I was told mine was on the way. Ten minutes later, still no sandwich. Nearly 15 minutes later, he is now almost finished, and I haven't gotten my food yet. Disappointed, we ask them to forget the order, as I don't want to sit and eat while he watches me.   While they did refund our money, and kindly even offered up to have us take the delayed sandwich to go (which I appreciated), they tried to convince us that we were being unreasonable. The manager brought out receipt to try and prove we hadn't been waiting that long. It was not our receipt (different order), which we pointed out. We also again explained that we were disappointed by being served at different times when we made a single order. She then continued to make excuses (the cook can only make one sandwich at a time, usually people eating at cafes don't want to wait, we should have told them that we wanted both of the sandwiches at the same time...) all of which were ridiculous. There were only about four other people eating there at the time, so it wasn't a matter of being too busy.   I would not eat inside again, as you apparently must preface that you'd like to eat at the same time as your dining partner. Perhaps phoning in an order is the way to go."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but the food was very tasty, the prices and portions reasonable, and the service was just as good.  It is inside of a 99 Ranch market.  I had the Singapore noodles known for the delicious taste of curry.  The portion was so large I could not finish it all and took the rest home."}
{"text":"Was good!  My first time here...had the Singapore fried noodle, and it was really good. A little spicy, but not too much.  I'll definitely be back to try the veggie buffalo wings!"}
{"text":"A little hidden gem tucked away next to the Circle K gas station on the corner of Stephanie and Warm Springs in Henderson. Having never tried a Vegan restaurant , I was absolutely amazed how fresh and tasty our meal was.  For under $10.00 per dish you can enjoy a variety of fresh vegetable dishes with tofu, noodle soups or sandwiches   (Side of rice is $1.50)  I recommend the Spicy Basil Tofu and eggplant. Just the right amount of spice and the veggies have a nice crunch. Also delicious is the Curry vegetable. A very mild curry with a slight hint of coconut. As others have mentioned, the  staff is very friendly and it is very clean!!  A must try if you enjoy Vietnamese style food."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian and vegan hidden gem inside the 99 Ranch Market. This place is hard to find but when you do it's worth it. Asian fusion type place with boba smoothies like taro and green tea. They have items like vegan egg rolls, potstickvegan pho, stir fry, and even vegan sandwiches.   I love the buffalo wings and potstickers. Best part is there is no meat and the food taste so raw and organic. I love it!"}
{"text":"This first of its kind restaurant defies fast casual healthy eating. With a Vietnamese influenced menu, VeggiEAT Xpress offers a variety of vegan meals including noodles soups, curry veggie chicken, sub sandwiches, Boba tea,  veggie buffalo wings, and (my favorite) spicy rice noodle soup. And did I mention all menu items are 100% vegan? Very tasty recipes I went 2 days in a row. Food is great and this is my new place for a quick healthy bite to eat. The dining room offers a quick or casual setting. Also the staff is very passionate and friendly. I orders the beef stew and it was fantastic. The veggie beef is made of misty mushroom caps that satisfy my cravings for beef. I also tried the buffalo wings, taste just like chicken. The egg rolls are a bit dry most likely because it does. Or contain egg."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the veggiEAT Xpress inside 99 Ranch on Maryland so of course I was excited to try the new location. The restaurant location is great... It is so nice to enjoy yummy veggie food without having to look at dead animals (like inside 99 Ranch).   I always get the spicy lemongrass beef pho. Here it is just as delicious in taste as at their other location. However, there was only half as many noodles as we are used to at their other location. When my boyfriend complained, they charged him for more noodles. When the additional noodles came out, we reminded the waitress that we had been waiting for our egg rolls for almost 30 minutes. The waitress went to go check with the cashier and came back saying that out of our 3 receipts, there was no egg roll order. That was the entire reason for our second order! I originally ordered 2 phos, and then after I paid, my boyfriend said he wanted egg rolls. So he ordered egg rolls on his card and the cashier said \"are you sure you don't want anything to drink?\" To which my boyfriend replied that he would get a boba as well. The waitress had my boyfriend walk up to the cashier to clarify the order. The cashier said, \"uhh I didn't hear that order.\" My boyfriend still wanted the egg rolls so he ordered them again. When they came out we were thoroughly disappointed. The egg rolls at this location are over fried versions of the Maryland location.   At first I thought that the service was good. The cashier and waitress were super sweet. After the incident with the noodles, I just chopped it up to owners/managers/cooks. After the incident with the egg rolls, my boyfriend was taken aback by the attitude he was receiving as a customer. I would suggest that the staff (and maybe management) take some classes in customer service for the betterment of this establishment. Luckily, I live closer to their Maryland location so I won't need to come back here again.   I am trying really hard to get my boyfriend to enjoy vegan restaurants so it is really a let down when he says \"man I might have enjoyed my food if it wasn't for their terrible customer service.\""}
{"text":"What The Cluck...  Helpful Tip: Located inside 99 Ranch Market! Enter, turn left, thank me later.   After reading such delightful reviews I popped in for some buffalo wings this afternoon. The service was quick and the presentation was pretty flippin' impressive. Crunchy Vegan wings with an actual chop stick for wing appeal I suppose. Whatever the case I'm here for it! I'm not a huge fan of soy but lets be honest it's damn near in everything that doesn't contain real meat (Contents: soy protein, wheat fiber and various plant starches).  The buffalo sauce is \"extremely\" vinegary with a spicy twist for my anti spice peeps!!   $10 = 5 Wings"}
{"text":"Great options for healthy vegetarian and vegan Vietnamese food. The location was clean. You order at the front and they bring the food to you. We ordered the veggie egg rolls, spicy basil \"chicken\" and thai iced tea with boba. The egg rolls and Nina were ok. The spicy basil chicken was flavorful and delicious. Would like to try their soups next time."}
{"text":"Though I do eat my veggies.I am not a vegetarian or a vegan but I met my good friend here today for lunch.  Very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.  I ordered the \"beef\" sandwich and it was absolutely delicious!  I ordered the foot long and it is a healthy portion.  My friend had the pot stickers and by the time I got to try one they were gone!  Now nicknamed the \"Disappearing Pot Stickers!\"  Heehee.  He loved them, so next time I'll be sure to get an order!  The place has only been open a week we; were told that the inside is all new and they are working on changing the signage.  So for my first visit there I was extremely pleased and will definitely go back to try other sandwiches or entrees!  Oh, and I had the Thai Tea with Boba and it was very nice and refreshing!  Overall I loved it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!Not too expensive at all. If you're used to eating at local vegan spots - this is great pricing. Charles was working today & he was AWESOME. Best customer service I've had in months. Food came out quickly. Free appetizer (accidentally made us the wrong one so it was free!) Charles was very attentive and helpful. We will be back regularly!"}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers,, you've let me down on this one .. trusted the ratings , even ordered some of the recommended menu items but just had the worst lunch ever. The broth from the spicy rice noodle soup has a horrible pungent order , the chewy egg rolls taste like cinnamon , the flavors were just all wrong and I usually love Vietnamese cuisine. Not a fan and the husband agrees it was pretty bad."}
{"text":"I did not like this place the water is so good but this place hurt my stomach.. they cook there food in heavy oil and I wasn't feeling good after I ate it."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this new place with my mom and sister. My sister is in town visiting, and she likes wonton soup.   The place itself is cute. It's small, but enough for a lunch crowd.   A little confusion on the orders and service though. My sister had ordered veggie spring rolls and potstickers when she first got there at 12. I arrived at 1215, and at about 1225 my mom asked about the potstickers, to which the server looked very confused. We saw her go back over to the counter and look through a stack of receipts. She then came back to the table, and my mom showed her the receipt with the potstickers right on it. They apparently forgot to make them. Oops.  Also, when I ordered, I asked for a straw since I never got one, and an ice water for my daughter. Neither one of those ever made their way to our table.  We also asked for 2 to go boxes, which never came to the table either. I had to get up and go ask for them at the counter myself. A little irritating.   The food itself was tasty. I ordered the fried rice and the veggie walnut shrimp. The sauce on the shrimp was really good! The broccoli was crunchy. The fried rice was yummy.   Not sure we will be back or not. As they are new, we may give them another try on service, since there are a few things I saw on the menu that I want to try out. The vegan cheesecake is on my radar!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! What a treat!!! Vietnamese and Chinese Vegetarian and Vegan Dishes were on point! We had the Vegan Veggie Spring Rolls! They are wrapped in rice paper so it was gluten free too. Hubby had the Singapore Fried Rice Noodles and the flavor was great, also Vegan option so yummy! I had the Vegan Chicken sandwich! Wow! Great flavor!!! Added the Vegan Oreo cheesecake for dessert, good but super sweet so next time we will get the plain vegan cheesecake! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this spot for a while.  Fast food veggie food?! What a delight! I am so pleased with the variety on the menu and the food and service are impeccable. If your an aspiring vegan or just want to get more delicious healthy food in you. This is the place. They even do veggie sushi on Friday and Saturday nights.  Full menu of gourmet veggie delights priced fairly and perfect portions.  They also deliver with postmates."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Now serving vegan sushi on Saturday nights. I'm not vegan but I love this place."}
{"text":"Love the pho! I admit I haven't tried much else because I keep getting drawn to these filling, flavorful, healthy soups. However, my companions love the sandwiches and they do look delicious .   Service is usually friendly and helpful. Sometimes we have to wait a bit but the food is always worth it."}
{"text":"I love VeggieEAT! I've pretty much tried everything on their menu and you really can't go wrong especially if you're a vegan or vegetarian. My favorite soup is the lemongrass, favorite appetizer are the chicken wings, favorite sandwich is a toss up between the pork and mushroom. But, one of the biggest seasons I come here is because of the owner and wait staff. I talk to the owner all of the time and she tells me the different herbs and spices they use. You can tell she cares about the food they serve and very accommodating when it comes to diet needs. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"My son is a teenager, after I took him to this place to eat the first time,  he always wants to go again to get the fruit smoothie and sandwich. We are not vegetarians but we like the food in this restaurant so much.! Highly recommended to friends!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegan lunch. The portions are big. The staff is great. It's hard to find good Asian vegan fast food like this. The location is s bit strange the first time you go: it's inside of an Asian supermarket. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"I really can't explain how GOOD the food here was and how confused I was at the fact that there was NO REAL meat in my noodle soup.. Haha we asked because we were so convinced that it was real meat. I am not vegan or vegetarian so I really enjoy a place that can give me the same kind of flavors and textures as real meat. Also I was really delighted with how sweet the cashier was; we decided to sit down at a table to try some before leaving and he went from being cashier to server mode and he brought over bowls for us at the table even though we had ordered to go. I would eat here like almost everyday if I were vegetarian or vegan since it's hard to find places that have so much flavor. But even not being on any restricted diet, this IS THE PLACE for great Asia cuisine - I'm definitely adding this place to my TOP FAVORITES and I'm picky you gotta check it out  *PLUS - they have smoothies!"}
{"text":"Always excited to find and try a new vegetarian place in town.  This one is surprisingly in a food court inside a 99 ranch. Nice clean area, easy to see and read signs and free parking outside the market. It's a little hard to find so here is how you find this place: Navigate to address. Find the 99 ranch market. Go inside the front door of the market. Turn left and go all the way to the end till you see a turnstile. Go through it you will see a bakery. To the right of the bakery is the veggie place.  You can takeout and sit to eat. If you get the footling sand which which is cheaper then getting two half sandwiches you can ask them to pack it up on two's. One for here, one to go! Here is the review of what we ordered: Summer rolls - pros: slightly warm so they were soft and fresh. Cons: I prefer summer rolls with more vegetable and very little noodles so I thought it was tasty but it wasn't my preference. The sauce was a little too sweet/tangy for me but still tasty. - I give it 3/5 stars. Singapore noodles - pros: pretty good, had a good ratio of vegetable and noodle. Cons: was expecting that addicting warm intense curry flavor but it wasn't fully there. It grew on me though after I stopped expecting the curry intensity. 4/5 stars. Egg rolls - Pros: they have that bubbly crispy skin from bean curd that I love. And I was very surprised to bite into it and find that it was meaty. It was different but really good! 5/5 stars!! And I like it came with pickles. Love Asian pickles. Grilled tofu banh mi or sand which footlong - pros: the sand which is $4.25 for half size and if you get footlong you just add $2.25 so pretty good deal. It has grilled tofu fixings and looks quite packed. Cons: too dry, not enough taste for that full bodied flavor. 4/5 stars  Service: really nice and friendly. We sat down and she brought us water and the food as it came out. 5/5  Atmosphere: clean food court atmosphere well lit. For a food court place 5/5.  I give it an overall 5/5 for having a rarity which is a vegetarian with vegan option place that is in a food court!! Rare and awesome! Keep it happening! Spread the love! And maybe add in just a tad more full body flavor and it will be flying stars!"}
{"text":"I'll be back.  Let's hope the quality I experienced will continue.  I ordered the Vegetable Minced Meat with a side of white rice, to go.  The flavor was very good.  The slight spicy ginger came through nicely.  The veggies were done just right.  Had enough crunch left.   The portion size was good.  Asked if I wanted rice, I said yes then saw on the bill it was $2 extra.  It should be part of the entree.  I also ordered a Honeydew Boba to go.  Very good.  Fresh flavor.  The bill was $16.72.  More than I thought it would be.  But $9.95 + $2 for rice for $11.95, that's not bad for a good veg/vegan meal.  I'll have to get back to try more items.  This is a good addition for the area for a vegetarian/vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"Warning: Singapore fried noodles is made spicy.  I ordered the Singapore fried noodles to go via eat24 with no special instructions. Menu does not state that it is spicy. I love spicy food but this was too much to handle. Spicy level was a 4 out of 5. Just be aware prior to ordering."}
{"text":"My wife and I just recently switched back to the Vegan lifestyle so this place opened up at just the right time. I ordered the Vegan Beef Sandwich and my wife ordered the Curry Chicken Rice Noodle Soup. We also shared the egg rolls. The egg rolls were good, but I feel like it needed some sort of tasty sauce to go with it. The Vegan beef sandwhich was AMAZING. Lots of flavor and the full portion was HUGE! We weren't a fan of the noodle soup. It looked good when it came out and had a very pleasant aroma, however, it was just too bland. Our first thought was that the chef forgot to season the dish.   Overall, it was a good first experience. We will definitely be going back to try some more items off of their menu."}
{"text":"I was in town for a realestate convention. Good place to eat some good veggies. Only thing is i saw her microwave my white rice...I DO NOT USE THE MICROWAVE. So the rice was a little crunchy."}
{"text":"Best Vegan restaurant I've been to. The food is so good I couldn't believe it. My 8 year old ate all her vegetables with no fuss. We don't live close, but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was good. I'd eat there again!  The pho was a bit greasy for me. I'd probably try something else.   The prices are very reasonable. The rolls were decent. Went with the beef. The shrimp is vegetarian. I'd give the minced \"pork\" and string beans a try next round. I'd go back. It's a little off the strip, folks are nice. Would go back. Large portion on pho too but it wasn't rice noodles."}
{"text":"Vegan.   Need i say more?    Delicious!    If you're wanting to explore but are nervous about Vegan then this is a safe bet. Surprisingly this would be great for carnivores as the flavors are delicious and resemble meat. I've been here every week on my day off. I deliver Part time for GrubHub which delivers and with Eat24 and heard so much about their soft launch I had to try and I've decided to convert to vegetarian/vegan for health reasons. Tried chicken pho, combo pho, tofu pho and their wonton soup and all great. The Black Pepper chicken is phenomenal. The Beef chow fun has great flavor and very filling for this guy. The  BBQ ribs and the bBq chicken are so good. Let's put it this way you won't be disappointed. They took over Cook On Wok spot and very easy to find behind circle K.   It's across on the southeast corner from Sprouts so easy for a meal before shopping.   The staff is super helpful and friendly. If I could give my first 6 star review for a $-$$ place I would.   Sushi is available once a week as a test.   Follow their page to get updates on the vegan sushi as it changes from week to week   Update,  continuing to visit a few times a month and absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing! They just went 100% vegan as on December 1st, 2017. I went there on a date with my boyfriend and we got the \"egg\" rolls, fried rice, and three different sushi rolls. Everything was really tasty! The customer service was on point! I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Was passing though this area running and found VeggiEat Xpress. It's not an Xpress anymore. It's a swanky sit down restaurants a little bring but maybe that can be remedied with some window treatment. Parking was good. Location is still dusty from construction but very nice.  The owner greater us super kind, warm, welcoming, and enthusiastic. We felt very invited and good about coming into the place although we were the only ones there. Apparently they just opened less than a week ago. The back patio was closed but after some persuasion they let my partner put his dog there so that she could stay cool.  I came in ravenous and ordered three things:  The combo pho which was good with a variety of meats.  My favorite I think is the \"chicken\" . Some of the \"meat\" tasted like teriyaki. I wasn't used to that in pho.  I ordered chicken nuggets. Skip those. Tasted good . Looked not very appetizing. Next time I want to try the sweet and sour \"chicken\" instead.  The curry noodles we ordered were the best. One of the recommended items. Soo good. Would order again.  Lastly tried the thai tea. Substituted Almond milk. Tasted decent but consistency was a little off. I would stick to a milk tea or slush. It might have been the almond milk. Almond creamer would have been better. Lucky to have an option besides soy.  So all in all would be back again. I want to come back for the ban mi. Looks so good!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Today was my first time trying this place, I'm so glad I found it!!! I had the vegan dumplings & vegan fried rice. AMAZING! Everything tasted fresh! I can't wait to try their other items, mainly one of their pho's or soups!"}
{"text":"Such good vegan food! Best in the area. The chicken curry soup is delicious! The veggie fried rice is amazing. The staff was so friendly. Great experience"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and place was def unique. When we received our sandwiches however it seemed they were all bun and very small portions of pho meat and condiments for the price paid. Perhaps this will change in the future?"}
{"text":"Our family are new vegetarians aspiring vegans. We found this little gem last night...the fully vegan menu was delish! My favorite was the spring rolls and the cheesecake! My son loved his vegan chicken nuggets! Our server was phenomenal! This will definitely be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. We have tried every vegan option in Las Vegas and hands-down, this is one of the best. This restaurant is distinguished from Veggie House (still good) because here, they are not \"breading-happy\". The worst thing about vegan Chinese food is that the cooks have to bread literally everything before covering the breaded tofu or vegan chicken in sauces. At VeggiEAT Xpress, we did not have the same problem. For this reason, its nice to know that this doesn't have to be to my cheat meal of the week.   Veggie Orange Chicken: GREAT. The sauce tasted authentic and had real hints of orange zest. Nothing artificial about the flavor. The \"chikn\" was not breaded, instead, it was tender and cooked with delicious red bell peppers, etc.  Veggie Spicy Basic Chicken: DELICIOUS. I love basil. Excellent job. Same quality of chickn as discussed above.    Veggie Beef Yakitori: EXCELLENT. My absolute favorite. The veggie beef was so well seasoned , as if they marinated the meat in the sauce for a couple hours, and very tender. I rarely discover a good quality of vegan beef and this one takes the top of the list along with one other restaurant.   Veggie Shrimp Rolls: Could not tell a different from the non-vegan version of these babies. Great.  Veggie Buffalo Wings: EXCELLENT. That is all.   We will be back. Cannot say what the place looks like inside because we ordered delivery.  I hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"This place rocks my socks off. As a vegan family, it's challenging to find great food and especially great food that our non-vegan friends and family will enjoy. Jackpot. Wonderful flavors, wonderful service, the owners are awesome. All in all, a fantastic spot. We eat there often and that won't be changing unless they do. Hurray!"}
{"text":"Had the Vegan Curry Chicken and Wonton Noodle Soup!!! Sounds amazing!!  seems like a popular a vegetarian and vegan location in Henderson! Perfect location."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. We had potstickers and spicy basil chicken, green beans and spicy mint ground meat. Yummy"}
{"text":"Wait: No wait; sat down right away.  Food: Vegan option overload, I'm pretty sure I was in heaven for a second. (Meat available too). Food was super delicious. I don't remember exactly what I ordered but damn whatever vegan sandwich I ordered was like biting into... into... heaven (I know I said that already; I'll try to expand my vocabulary next time, but it's just a review not an English essay geez haha) Came here with my parents and ordered like 5 plates to try different things. They're not vegan, but I definitely saw their jaw drop after realizing how good it was.  Service: Friendly people, wait for food wasn't long. Freakin brilliant for starting this place!"}
{"text":"Really don't want to give this place 3 stars but... it is solely based on the sandwich I had! I give the sandwich 2 stars and the overall location, interior and service 5 stars. Let's start with the sandwich first.  I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich and like someone mentioned in their review before me, there is more bread than veggies/meat itself. The sandwich consisted of few slices of imitation pork meat, some iceburg lettuce, cucumber and jalapenos. I think for how fluffy the bread its, there needs to be more fillings and also because it was quite pricey too! I will be back though, to try their a la carte options such as eggplant with tofu and their soups. I will definitely update my review when I do.  Interior is excellent on the other hand. There are plenty of tables and it is spacious. This would actually be a good place to study, not sure if they would allow it though."}
{"text":"New location in Henderson! Stephanie St just south of Warm Springs. They've been open for 2 weeks and I've been there 3 times already, it's that good. The Combo Pho is amazing! It comes with several different types of faux meat, but I like the faux pork the best. I asked for the Pho with just the faux pork, and they were happy to make it for me. You know how there are a couple of things that you could eat every day and never grow tired of it? That's how I feel about the Pho with just faux pork. AND the service is top notch. We all know how rare good service is here in the Valley, and how it can make or break an experience. The staff is friendly, they will answer all of your questions and offer suggestions. They know the difference between vegans and vegetarians, and they know which items to recommend. My meat eating husband even liked the food. Five years I've been trying to get him to cross over, and finally he's inching over."}
{"text":"The best Vegan/Vegetarian food period!!! The chicken tastes like real chicken.. and the curry... WOW!!!.."}
{"text":"I LOVE Veggieat! Even my non-vegan friends go here without me! The buffalo wings are the best wings I've had so far, and all the food always tastes fresh and flavorful. So far my favorite thing is the Banh Mi sandwiches, they were way bigger than I expected and I couldn't finish the last one I got. Make sure to call and ask if the sushi chef is here - they have very creative and gourmet sushi rolls for sale certain days.   What more can I say? The service is friendly and attentive, the restaurant is bright and clean, and the food is all vegan and delicious. One of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"First, I am glad to see more Vegan places opening up around town. This was our first time here and probably won't be back. We ordered the pot stickers, egg rolls, fried rice and two desserts. The rice was good and so was the desserts but the rest was so so.  The service was good but over all, 3 stars.  Lastly, they do not accept American Express cards. I personally like to earn rewards and be rewarded for excellent credit and Amex does that for me. If a business does not accept their cards, everything else better be amazing where I would use another one of my cards to come back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan phö in the city. Bold statement but true.  Is it the best overall? It's up there but all the meat eaters agreed they would order the vegan/vegetarian pho options coming back. But remember it's not in a fancy restaurant, there aren't a million options, you're not going to have some amazing ambience but it's straight to the point, the staff is nice and hands down a new hangover cure #4"}
{"text":"The veggie ribs in black bean sauce are really good. This is a food-court style restaurant in a supermarket, more for to-go orders than eat-in orders. Glad I found it during my trip to Las Vegas. Quite yummy and inexpensive. However, the egg rolls, although good, could have been better. I will definitely return next time I'm in Las Vegas but will probably skip the egg rolls."}
{"text":"Always grateful when a new veggie place pops up in Vegas, but this is exceptional. Curry veggie chicken with French bread, veggie beef sandwich, and wonton noodle soup. So impressed, and putting this into my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy vegan spot. Good choice of soups and noodles. If you have no time for dinner and want to take to go order - this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time ordering from here and I loved it! I ordered the beef pho to go and I got there 10 min after they closed and they didn't turn me away and my meal was hot and ready I just walked in picked it up and walked out. It is so convenient and the food is delicious! I will be going back again."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and loved it! The girls working were very sweet and the fresh mango boba was to die for. Looks like they have a new regular!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best vegan restaurants in Vegas.  The owner is always out to talk to customers and likes to ensure you enjoyed her food.   The vegan sushi is an amazing addition to their menu."}
{"text":"Very impressed at their Vegan options. New at this diet and I have been missing cheese and chicken. They got the texture right in their soy based 'chicken' Will def come back affordable prices and great flavor."}
{"text":"It's great to have more vegan options near by!  We love going to Veggie house but it's all the way in Spring Mountain.   The place is clean and the people are friendly. We ordered 3 things and a taro boba and it was kinda slow...  Our basil \"chicken\" came out fast, but our appetizers took about 20 mins.. they were dumplings and spring roll.  When it did come out, they tried to give us another basil chicken.. but we only ordered one. Maybe they didn't think we got any food yet?    The Basil chicken wasn't bad, a little salty for me but my husband said it wasn't. But what both threw us off was the fake chicken meat, it was very weird. We've had a lot of fake meat but this one was so odd. I would still get the dish next time but just all veggies because the sauce was good.  The dumplings wasn't our favorite, it was so oily and full of water inside.. it has a weird after taste but the size was good.   The spring rolls was good, it had fake shrimp but it was the biggest spring roll I've ever seen lol it was so packed with noodles and the peanut sauce was relish.  The Taro bobs was ok, I had a few pearls that was kinda hard.   I thought it was weird too that we sat down, then had to go back in the front to order.  And the bathrooms didn't have any sign...  they just opened so I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement but I hope they do stick around!"}
{"text":"Pretty good veggie curry with good serving size. The cashier was very friendly and she sold me on the curry because she said, \"our curry is really good\". It really was. More like a simple homemade curry, not super oily. The soy pieces were good and I liked the crunch of freshly cooked green beans. The cilantro added a bit of zest. ($8.95, good for two). My mom ended up eating my leftovers and she said it was good. She doesnt even normally eat curry or vegetarian.  My dad got taro boba($3.95) so everyone's happy. Although I ordered coffee and peach cake from Bakery & Cafe next door, if I lived nearby I would probably try the VeggEat French coffee."}
{"text":"There is such a huge menu and everything we ordered was so flavorful... my family and I all ordered a few things we did sandwiches, fried rice, pot stickers, soups, and some entrees! The server/host was super friendly and it's a cute little spot...The cheese cake is a must!"}
{"text":"First time here and I got a BBQ PORK banh mi! Long! I'm glad I did because it was Super delicious!!! Omg. I will be coming back more often! There is a sauce inside the sandwich that I am obsessed with."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.   My favorite is the sandwiches! WAY BETTER than those made at Veggie Delight!   The dishes are alright. They've got plant based options, so can't complain. Although, it would be better if it were ALL plant based. It's a bit confusing to choose from Vegetarian or Vegan. How do you really know for sure what's in that stuff?  Also, the last time I ate here with my hubby, he got a mushroom soup and felt miserable! Food borne illness?  I had a sandwich and felt fine, so idk? A bit sketchy!  All in all, I'd still go back. For the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this is the best Thai food but it was good. The yellow curry could use a bit more flavor.. the Thai tea was delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, all vegan!!  The service was excellent, food was great, and the owner told me they do vegan sushi nights every Friday!! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Who knew vegan food would be such AMAZING food!  This has been our go-to place for our Sunday Fun-days. We'd usually go to church, then gym, and then here! They offer a wide variety of things and we've tried so much on the menu, nothing has disappointed yet!  The food tastes really good and is freshly made to order. The sandwiches are THE best though. Every bite is so tasty!  I want to try out their specialty on the drinks sometime. But if you're looking for something healthy to eat or just something new to try, definitely check this place out. It's located on Stephanie in the adobe plaza.   We absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Great taste!! Healthy food and reasonable prices!! Will come back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a mushroom sandwich, veg egg roll, and fried rice.  I would order all again except the egg rolls, the wrapper on them was very chewy not sure why other than that they tasted ok.  The fried rice was so delicious I didn't even miss the egg in it, sad I had to share it.  The mushroom sandwich was also so fresh and hit the spot except watch out for the jalapeño on it! I thought it was green pepper and took a huuuge bite!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish here is the tomato Rice Noodle Soup and veggie egg rolls. I'm glad I can find a place for a quick bite that is so affordable. Will recommend this place to everyone who wants healthy delicious foods."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. I had tofu and vegetable pho. It was good, I had to make it spicy. Very fresh and soothing for our weather right now. My husband ordered combination fried rice and it was good. If you do a yelp check in they will give a free tea of your choice. We got the almond milk tea and it was good also.
