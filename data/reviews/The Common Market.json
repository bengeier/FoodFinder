{"text":"Fun atmosphere with a solid selection of brews. Staff has always been helpful in giving recommendations."}
{"text":"i  love the cm for a quick fix on food and drinks! its also fun to hang out and drink wine too! im a fan!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for the patio alone. It's just a bonus that it also has an excellent deli, fantastic selection of beer and wine, interesting knick knacks and a chill, weird atmosphere that's rare in Charlotte. 

Events at CM are great fun, from movies to music. The crowd is there to relax and have a good time. 

If what you want to do is  \"hang out,\" this place was made for it!"}
{"text":"OK, the CM is a market, not a bar and not really a restaurant. Yes, they have a deli and yes you can eat on their patio and yes, it is good deli food as far as deli goes leaning toward hippie-ish. 

So why is this place really cool? Well, they have one of the best beer selections in Chlt and you can buy a beer from the cooler and then go to the patio and drink it OR take it home. Can't do that in a regular bar but now the best part. You can drop off the face of the earth (as long as you don't tell everybody your secret hideout) when you go into their patio. It's a tiny courtyard that you only get to thru the store. No one can see in or out. You are surrounded by 4 brick walls with sky above. This is the perfect rendezvous place. Did I mention they have a great wine selection?  

If you're looking for a place to meet incognito and have a great beer or bottle of wine, CM is the place. And it's close to so many other great places too boot."}
{"text":"Forgive this post. It's late, and I'm a bit rusty.


Last week, a coworker and I went to the Common Market for sandwiches. Hailing, most recently, from Chicago and, before that, Savannah, GA, I've experienced some awesome healthy-minded grocery stores. CM was right on par with some of my favorite markets elsewhere. 

The food was great. I ordered the club sandwich, which was not only made awesome, but was also reasonably priced. 

The shop itself, as previously stated, reminded me a lot of some of my other favorite markets of the same genre. And, being that I'm not quite the fan of Charlotte yet, it was nice to experience a place, in the city, that brought me back.

As for the staff, they were quick, friendly, and efficient. My only complaint was that I had to ask for a bag at the counter, to carry my lunch out.

Overall, I'd say CM is a place I'm glad I found in Charlotte. Personally, it brings back some good memories of places I've loved, and they have great sandwiches.

{"text":"Amazing breakfast wrap!! Had one a few weeks back and was able to stop in again today. Great breakfast sandwich!! Fresh, tasty and well prepared. Best part about this spot is the staff. Super helpful, friendly and welcoming!! Keep it up all around!!"}
{"text":"Ever wanted to just buy a six pack or bottle of wine and sit on a side walk drinking and people watching? This is the place to do it!  Great beer and wine selection, diverse mix of people who have all been friendly in my experience. One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Now I understand what all the hype is about. This was my first visit and there was so much to take in: a small dining area to the right, a fabulous selection of wine and beer to the left, and cute little deli in the back.  Thankfully, the manager noticed me staring in awe and was nice enough to come over and see if I needed any help. He directed me to a rotating bin full of $5.99 and $6.99 bottles. Awesome! The wine selection is small in size, but not short on quality options at diverse price points: from $5.99 - $100.

I also took advantage of their lunch special: a grilled cheese sandwhich and a large bowl of soup for $7. You can choose the type of bread and 2 cheeses. I ordered American and cheddar cheese on honey wheat bread and added tomato. It was good. It's no Papi Queso, but it's good. 

I had the jerk chicken and black bean soup. It was delicious. In particular, the broth was AMAZING!! With every sip I felt like I was back in Jamaica. HEY MON!! Seriously, they should bottle the broth and sell it. 

I also purchased a fresh cheese Danish. My plan was to take it to work the next morning for breakfast, but it looked so inviting that I couldn't wait. I ate it after I finished my soup and it didn't disappoint. Delicious! It was so soft and fresh.

I also got the blue cheese and bacon penne pasta (clearly I shouldn't shop while I'm hungry). I ate the pasta the next day and it was great. If you like blue cheese and bacon, you can't go wrong with this dish. It's served cold with just enough mayo to coat the penne. It could function as a snack or meal. 

This place is packed with charm, good food and great service. They also have several local gifts (from charlotte inspired post cards to cookies from a popular NC bakery). If you've never been, add it to your list. This place is a must try! It's eclectic and welcoming.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place has an old school punk feel too it. Every inch of store space has something to catch the eye. The small outside are is littered with stickers and graffiti. The only reason this place doesn't have get 5 stars is the seating. There is not much of it and some of the chairs are not very comfortable.

The fact you can get vegan potato salad here is awesome! They have a lot of variety and snack foods for vegan/vegetarian folk, and the prices are very reasonable. I love that this place is like a little beer shop you can drink at, aka, they don't have jacked up prices on beer. They also have a great selection beer.

Also all the people who work here are very nice and friendly. I always feel welcome and enjoy the good vibes put out but the employees and most of the patrons. This is a great place to relax with some good food and drink, but not so much the ideal place for a date."}
{"text":"Same great food menu and beer selection of the original Common Market, but with more sitting room inside and out. Also the overall look of the place is slightly more polished.

I have started going to this CM more often for the sole reason that the seating is so much better and I love getting work done on my laptop while sitting out in the fenced in patio area.

They also seem to have a lot of weekly events, though I'm usually not around later at night to witness them. I have seen some decent live music and DJs here though."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the Common Market. Talk about a vast craft-beer selection. I usually get a beer to hold me over while I contemplate which six pack to get from the cooler; usually takes awhile. Since I'm in my twenties it's refreshing to go somewhere at night where there is a younger crowd. People have commented on how this place is too tight/lacking in space. That is true but I feel it only encourages people there to meet others. There has been a couple times, for example, where all seats were taken so my friends and I had to share a bench with other people. We made some friends that night. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I visit my sister. Been here less than a week and had their sandwiches twice already. Employees are super friendly, willing to talk to 2 old ladies, and the food is awesome!!! Worth leaving sunny FL for."}
{"text":"What can I say that has not already been said. Amazing deli and friendly staff, this market is an example of what we need more of in this town. Fresh food, local music and great crowd!"}
{"text":"Common Market is a great place! It has one of the best beer selections in Charlotte. (They also have a lot of wine) You can get good microbrews for a decent price and enjoy them there or take them home. There is occasionally live music and other events on the patio and behind the store. But even when there's not the patio is still a great place to sit and socialize. The only downside to the patio is that it isn't that big and can get crowded and smokey. Inside there is a great atmosphere with an eclectic music selection and usually interesting people with whom you can talk. Inside there is also a deli area with sandwiches, soups and salads. The menu includes vegan options if that's your thing. There are also a lot of interesting trinkets you can buy.

The Common Market is a great place to sit with a group of friends, a special friend, or by yourself. There are areas that get very loud but there are a couple corners you can find that are quiet enough to read by yourself all the while enjoying tasty beverages and food. It's also in a great neighborhood where you can walk to a number of other fun places."}
{"text":"CM is popular because it is quirky and trendy, and the sandwich was good, but to me CM is a bit over-hyped."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great idea. Buy you wine and drink it in the store - they provide the glasses and open it - no corkage fee. Also, a good variety of local and regional craft beers for a reasonable price. Friendly staff what more could you need on a Friday evening?"}
{"text":"Common Market has soooo many great reasons to visit! It's a great place to:

-Take friends visiting the city (it's a community staple)
-Have a cool brew
-Get a delicious sandwich (haven't had a bad one yet...although the last time I went they forgot to add bacon to my sandwich so double check your order before leaving)
-Write your next blog post...or is that just me:)

The staff is easy like Sunday morning. Come to chill and be sure to stop by when they have tastings and live music (ck out their site for details). It's totally worth it and with the oh-so-not-common atmosphere, you'll always something new to try!"}
{"text":"Grabbed take out for the offfice - wow - was kind of bad - salad was nearly 10 bucks and all lettuce.   I went back the next day for yogurt and watermelon - can't screw that up - watermelon was good but 4 bucks for a small container. 

Commom Markey has lot of fun things to try - graeat candy and in the past the sandwichs were not too bad. 

The uber cool at the deli counter are a turn off. 

So as for going back ??? Maybe only if I really have to."}
{"text":"CM is a great place to casually hang out with friends over a drink. Whether it be a beer, sharing a bottle of wine or a non-alcoholic drink, there's something for everyone. I've never had the food here, although I hear its pretty decent for a little joint! The outside patio is awesome in the warmer months!"}
{"text":"One of the best vegan sandwiches I've had.  The vegan dawn comes with soy sausage, but I'm allergic to soy.  The guy offered to substitute the sausage for an extra hash brown, no up-charge.  Also VERY reasonable prices!!"}
{"text":"Common Market is a hip, cool urban market that makes fantastic sandwiches, sells delicious beer wine and other beverages and offers all kinds of snacks and treats and toys. There are great options for vegetarians (but the chicken salad is a standout if that's your thing). It is one of the very few places in Charlotte that has real authentic character. I love the folks that work there and you can tell that they love working there, too. South End location is awesome too."}
{"text":"My absolute fav place to chill with a craft beer/glass of wine in the city.  Great scene/relaxed vibe.  Dogs welcome on the patio!  Need I say more for all the dog-lovers out there?! Great deli and wine/beer selection available inside."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood hang outs. Great beer selection, their deli is super fresh and delicious. If you're looking for left to center food items, try here. Everyone that works here is great to chat with. I've been here too many times to count, for a drink, for lunch, or just to hang on the patio. The studio I work at right up the street orders lunch here probably TOO much, haha."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches!! So many great options and great drink selection. Outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"When I want to have a couple drinks near home the Dilworth (I like to say Wilmore) location of Common Market is my go-to spot.  It's my spot for grab-and-go beer, my source for tea tree toothpicks and the best spot to find any sort of political or Jesus gear.  

I don't think that there are quite as many tattoos at this location, but hipsters are abundant and I like the vibe.  I felt concerned at first that the proximity to Uptown would lead to a yuppie vibe, but skinny jeans and funky glasses prevailed in the end.  Good sandwiches, good coffee, bands, beer tastings, tortas and cat litter.  I don't even have a cat, but I know where to find litter close to home if I ever do."}
{"text":"Great place to late night after hitting some breweries nearby. The atmosphere is also perfect for meeting friends for drinks on a weeknight. Best beer selection in southend. They have a decent wine selection as well. I'm a fan of the buy two get $2 off bins!"}
{"text":"This place is anything but common.  The sandwiches here are amazing.   I ordered the Californian turkey (recommended by the guy at the counter) on fabulous 9-grain bread which was cut nice and thick.   The ingredients were fresh and it was delicious.   There are so many cool products to look at that you don't mind waiting on to-go orders.  This place has been around for a long time and has devoted customers.   The vibe is cool and I could not help but feel a little uncool standing there but there's no judgement at a place like this.  I also love all the old candy products- candy necklaces, sugar daddy's and jawbreakers in the box.   They have some pretty interesting new items also.   I tried the Sirachi potato chips and they were a perfect accompaniment to my sandwich.   This place is a 10-minute drive from me and well worth my time.   People seem to rave about the amazing selection of beer and wine (and they're right) but I love their food."}
{"text":"Lots of cool snacks.

A large selection of deli meats and coffee.

The staff is cool and laid back.

You absolutely must see the patio outside. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was awesome,but, its way too slow. It's a real good click bar for the locals. They have everything from designer wine to Duraflame logs but if you're going into just pick up a sandwich, go someplace else !"}
{"text":"The Common Market, where Charlotte meets Brooklyn (almost). How can you not like that? It's a market/cafe with a great beer and wine selection and an open patio with an apple tree. It even comes with a little New York attitude."}
{"text":"A total hipster joint. That isn't a bad thing, I like the place but the kind of people that hang out there aren't my kind of people. I will continue to hit it up when I am looking to chill though!"}
{"text":"Everybody should love The Common Market. Its great. The live music is usually pretty awesome. The drink and food selection is good (and they carry Burt's Bees, another plus!) and the people are fun. There are very few things that can beat cracking open a fresh snapple and sitting down at the common market to people watch on a Friday Night ;)"}
{"text":"First time in today.  Man it was awesome to find a business with some soul in this city.  As a recent transplant from San Francisco it did my heart good to see a place with so many different types of people coexisting. 

Grabbed an awesome sandwich,  then much to my surprise found a 15 tap beer bar with some banging good beers.  Sandwich was spot on!!  Had a couple of local drafts, suggested by a staffer and I was in heaven.

Charlotte you should be proud to have such a wonderful business! !!  100% will be back...often!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to the South End spot.  While not as funky as Plaza Midwood I love this take on Urban Provisions!!!  Food great! Staff awesome!!  

Soups are spot on and that patio is smoking hot.  Great to have a joint in Southend that is locally owned, intriguing,  and an oasis of the melting pot of culture of this growing city!

Good show!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, Great people Great Drinks!!! my only complaint is the sealing looks as if it has never been cleaned in the history of the store. But the beer selection makes up for it."}
{"text":"A small treasure of Charlotte. Convenience store with a small bar with cool clientele and a great beer selection. Good stuff."}
{"text":"We stopped on our way through Charlotte, it's very easy to get to from 77. 

Neat place, good selection of beer and wine but the sandwiches were just soso. I ordered the Firehouse #8. My biggest complaint was the bread, I was expecting something better from their sourdough than a mushy wonderbread. I would definitely visit again when I have time to enjoy a beer on the patio."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have cool music being performed or a DJ playing cool music every now and then.  Beer/wine selection is great too!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty fantastic. They have something for everyone, from local craft beer to fun sandwiches. They do wine and beer tastings, and we were there for the Cold Mountain Winter Ale keg, which evidently is a hot item in Charlotte. 

The market isn't huge, but it has a great backyard with lots of space and seating. There is a small five-seat bar and there are several tables inside. One side is dedicated to craft and regular beer/wine, and there is a deli counter in the back.

Sandwiches are cheap, from about $6-8, and offer everything from turkey and sun-dried tomato spread to baked tofu. There are ample options for vegetarians and vegans, as well as a ton of choices for bread, fillings, and spreads. They also have a ton of kettle chips, side salads, and soups.

The guy behind the counter was really nice and brought our food to us at the bar. Bartender was cool as well. 

I liked this place so much, I hit up the other location on Commonwealth and was pleased to learn it has the same vibe and the same helpful, friendly staff. When I return to Charlotte, I will certainly return.

(For my fellow New Yorkers and Jersey kids, this place reminded me greatly of Bierkraft in Park Slope.)"}
{"text":"I walked here after Yoga to get something to drink (non-alcoholic that is), chill and have conversation with a friend. This is definitely the place for the eclectic crowd and is perfect for the Plaza-Midwood-Commonwealth area. There are tables outside to eat, converse and drink at. You can also bring your four legged friends with you. Lots of beer and wine to choose from inside. Of course they have your typical convenient store snacks but what I liked most was the vegan/vegetarian selection at the deli and a large variety of different juices and beverages that would don't normally find in your everyday grocery store. I think next time I'll try the Common Market at South End. Thats more of my type of crowd."}
{"text":"It's a perfect alternative (in every sense of the word) lunch place. Sometimes I want to grab a quick takeout lunch nearby that isn't fast food yet again. Common Market is great!  I can get a hot Pimmy D-lux, grilled pimento cheese with tomato and bacon, thus fulfilling my junk food craving but stepping it up several notches in quality.   I've also shopped here for mixed 6-packs of interesting beer. Another way I've enjoyed this place is taking the kids, letting them pick out gourmet sodas from the extensive selection, and lunching on the sunny patio. It feels grungy in a good way, neighborly, hipster in the hood."}
{"text":"This place isn't much to look at from the street. It's actually quite unappealing. In fact, I just walked by it last week and had no idea what it was, so I moseyed on by. So, I was kind of skeptical when I needed a place for lunch on Easter. But, I figured I should give it a try. 
While not a hipster, I definitely like this place. They have lots of beer and wine, old school candy, sweet shirts and old school random stuff + a deli! The sandwiches were pretty tasty, nothing special, but solid and fresh - I had the Californian which had turkey, lettuce, tomato, bean sprouts and avocado in it. But, next time I stop by, I think I'll grab a glass of wine with a nice hot Panini and sit outside."}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere.  I love it here.  It's super relaxed and friendly.  Their carrot cake is to die for.  Will definitely visit regularly!"}
{"text":"SO CRUCIAL.  Well picked wine and beer selection at nice prices.  Deli is open till three.  Best to get them made to order - the cold case sucks comparatively.  Awesome enclosed outdoor area.  Feels continental.  Decorated with liberal propaganda much of which is pretty lulzy.

I have to throw this out there that mixing the framboise with the double chocolate stout is awesome.  So awesome I kicked myself in the head.  Almost."}
{"text":"What I like so much about Common Market is the wine selection.  They have unusual and hard-to-find wines.  I believe I will miss this place when I move."}
{"text":"One of the best beer selections I have ever seen in such a small place (anywhere). Some nights this place turns into a bar where you can just go into the cooler and get anything you want. I'd actually rather go hang out at this market than many bars in the area due to their insane beer selection, vibe, and good prices."}
{"text":"maybe I'm missing my deli market from back home, or maybe I'm just a snob, but this just doesn't cut it for me.  It's ok, it has a better than decent beer and wine selection but the deli falls flat. Boars head is not deli meat, or at least not deli meat to be proud of. I mean its fine for a grocery store, but it's not  crap your pants good.  I recently ran to over there hoping to get a loaf of bread to bring home for a dip we made and they only had pre sliced bread, it was a let down.   

I also find the staff a little snobby for the product that they carry, but what can you do.  It is great as a wine/beer store, crappy as a deli, so thats why it lands at a three.    For what its worth, my wife is obviously a little meaner than me and said she has a hard time giving it anything higher than a two.  She might be right."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hang out on a week night. Meet complete strangers that are friendly, intelligent and outgoing. Great wine and beer selection. Also great place to explore different little knicknacks, sandwiches and entrees. On Fri and/or Saturdays, there is live bands that place this venue. Very artsy crowd and I love it."}
{"text":"A non-corporate meca for those who don't want to give their money to The Man. Buying products here is supporting small business and conscious entrepreneurship. Without places like the Common Market our world would be full of cookie cutter corporate franchises. The common market is the cornerstone for Plaza Midwood culture. This is where you'll find some of the most prominent characters that support the Charlotte subculture. These are the people that give Charlotte a soul. If you don't like this place you may want to go hang in Ballantyne  with all the other consumer puppets."}
{"text":"I love both CM's. The old and new I can't say enough positive things about the staff, the location their store, etc...."}
{"text":"Great Spot. Good Sandwiches and sides. Awesome beer selection. One of my favorites in Queen City"}
{"text":"Great great great. Beer... Wine... What else can a guy ask for. Both southend and plaza midwood offer a great selection and are super cool with questions or needed direction. Get a sandwich. Have a draft. And chill out."}
{"text":"I've been here a many times now for coffee and a breakfast sandwichs. The staff is very friendly and the store has a great eclectic vibe.

The food has always been great and I didn't find it bland like some previous posters. I'm not sure what they ordered but everything I've tried has hit the spot. Even their spicy food is well done. Their pepper filled Dragon Slayer breakfast sandwich hits the spot... spicy but not so much you can't taste the rest of the ingredients.

So far I've only hung out here in the morning but heard it's a fun place to be in the evening as well."}
{"text":"Do places like Common Market exist outside Charlotte? It's a crazy bar/corner store/deli hybrid and I gotta say, I kinda dig it. It's a great place to hang out with friends, where I can grab a beer (or six) and hang out on the patio. If I get hungry, I can grab a snack or a sandwich."}
{"text":"One of the best bottle shops in the charlotte and surrounding areas. Great selection of well crafted beer as well as some cold ones on tap. Food is also very good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Nothing fancy, on the expensive side, but very chill and laid back atmosphere. 
Good food, good wine, fun crowd."}
{"text":"Cool hipster place 
Don't expect a regular place and take this place for what it is :) 
I once forgot my credit card and this place gave me my drink and snack as a \"pay later\"! Wow! I was so impressed that a busy town place is trusting like that, I paid the very same day :)"}
{"text":"This is a must stop for Charlotte. Great bottled drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic. A little bar in house plus live music. It is a great community gathering place."}
{"text":"Love this place!    Super cool grocer/deli/live music.  Great outdoor patio for bands.  Great bands.  Love the employees.  On other night there was a kick - a-- DJ spinning records inside.  Good deli food. Fun interesting products to purchase."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with great mix of people. The patio is very relaxing and inviting as are the staff. Variety of food and beverage choices are refreshing! Parking can be a nightmare."}
{"text":"Don't have a patio? No problem, just come hang out at common market. I ventured out on Sunday to one of my favorite places, Laurel Market South, and discovered it was closed. Plan B was hitting up common market down the street and, fortunately, I was not disappointed. This place has a plethora of personality and a very diverse selection of beverages. The deli was good - many veg options. I had the Olympian wrap and was alright with it - a little too salty for my tastes. I enjoyed this wrap along with a delicious Ginger ale in the sick courtyard they have. I feel like it would be a great spot to venture on a sat afternoon to relax and have a beer with friends."}
{"text":"You won't find this atmosphere ANYWHERE else!  AWESOME sandwiches, soups, breakfast and a great beer selection.  Sweet zombie finger puppets and magnets too!"}
{"text":"Common Market is an awesome little hole in the wall spot. I took my parents here on Saturday to grab a quick lunch and drink.

All the sandwiches are delicious and there are so many options. We just got the grilled cheese but I really dont think you can go wrong, sandwich wise. My dad and I split a cup of broccoli and cheese soup. It surprisingly wasnt that great.....pretty bland. I think this is an anomily and not the norm cause every other soup I have gotten there has been delicious!

Beer selection is incredible. I grabbed a beer out of the $2 bin and it happened to be a beer I had in Germany.....loved it! This spot really can't be beat if you just want a casual time, sitting outdoors with some good drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, vegan and veggie snacks, all sorts of beers to buy and carryout, and great beers on tap too.  If one of these opened in ATL they would make a killing."}
{"text":"I have a hard time trying different sandwiches (either breakfast or lunch) because the Capri is so delicious, when I've strayed everything I've tried has been good. This is our favorite neighborhood breakfast spot, and a treat when I can make it over for lunch.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good, inexpensive sandwich."}
{"text":"The original--come enjoy a quick sandwich, good beer, or tasty bottle of wine.  No frills, no expectations, come one, come all.  The CM is a landmark.  So happy it's an integral part of the PM!"}
{"text":"A unique place to try new beer and wine, eat a healthy, fresh snack and enjoy life! It's a universally friendly environment and a popular meet up spot for all of my friends."}
{"text":"Beer! Beer! And more Beer!! I was in town for a business trip, mixed with a little but of pleasure. After dinner at Midwood Smoke I was looking to grab a few local beers for the evening and also to bring back to Ohio!  This place was amazing! The beer selection was fantastic! Unicorn Tears....so delicious!  Guy working the counter came over and helped us pick a few delicious local favorites.  Great place in a fun little neighborhood."}
{"text":"Definitely miss chilling with my friends here. One of the few places I could have a beer, see all my friends and bring my son. He absolutely loved it. I recently moved to Olympia, Washington and there really isn't a place like that here. =("}
{"text":"I have just discovered the Common Market and I couldn't be happier that I did.  It reminds me of a funky little deli from back home so it gives me the warm fuzzies while I peruse their killer beer selection.  They have everything a micro brew lover could want, including big bottles and single serve, build your own 6 packs.  They also have a great wine selection and they even carry sake!  There are lots of snacks, breakfast items, and organic choices, as well as off the wall treats and trinkets like \"Obama-mints.\"  I have never actually eaten at the deli, but I'm sure it's great too.  Oh and you can also buy single cigarettes for 33 cents.....so, if you are craving just one, CM is the place to go."}
{"text":"What a killer spot. The common market is tucked away in the heart of south end. If you want a good selection of beer & wine that you can't get at the local super market, this is the spot. My favorite part about CM is that you can have a seat and enjoy your beverage purchase on the spot either inside or on the huge patio are outside which is a regular host to live music. You'll see a huge variety of people here, so if you're in the mood for a good conversation this is the best place in town to drum one up! It'll also note that they do serve fresh deli food and coffee every day.

Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Great beer/wine selection, good sandwhiches and a really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"So embarrassed to admit I hadn't been here yet.  So we stopped in to check it out and I must say, I really like it. Excellent selection of beer and wine including some mead.  Odd configuration which is really my only complaint. A new person finds it difficult to negotiate, at least it's pretty compact. Love the little bar area in back. Way too convenient to have a glass of wine and sit outside in the sun. Love the outdoor area, we were day drinking so it was pretty chill. I actually prefer this to the Rhino down from my house for that \"lived in feel\".  I'm sure the Rhino will get there but until then, we'll drive the extra 3 minutes to come here."}
{"text":"Any place that has a neon Billy Dee Williams Colt 45 sign pasted on the wall is aces in my book..."}
{"text":"I have spent many Wednesday nights at the Common Market for their fantastic beer tastings.  Tommy does an excellent job of bringing in interesting microbrews from around the world for everyone to try.  The Common Market routinely gets beers before anyone else in the Charlotte area.  The selection is hard to beat and is always changing.  The staff are wonderful and attentive and know their beers!  And yes, there are hipsters galore, but when there's good beer, who cares?"}
{"text":"Awesome lil secret of charlotte , has delicious deli and quality Sides. Also has beer wine and some food you wouldn't expect a small hole in the wall to have .."}
{"text":"Got breakfast at another place in NoDa and was so disappointed that we left and went straight to Common Market for a second breakfast lol... The breakfast sandwiches and pimento grits were awesome. We also had a green juice from the juice bar that was solid. Thank you CM for saving our Charlotte breakfast. You're the real heroes."}
{"text":"I feel cooler for having been here.  This place was the cat's pajamas.  

It is many things all rolled into one.  When I was there is appeared to be an organic food store, a farmers market selling fresh vegetables and fresh fish, a beer bar, and a deli.  I was there for lunch so I had a black and white bean salad as a side and a tuna melt.  Anywhere that has a tuna melt is alright in my book, and this place was no different.  The sandwich was fresh and delicious.  The bean salad was awesome.  It was the two types of beans, and some onion, cilantro and lime.  I wish I could order it in bulk.  

I was with my vegetarian sister and she enjoyed all of the vegetarian options.  We sat outside on the patio.  There are a bunch of long picnic tables with umbrellas giving it a German beer garden feel.  

This place was so cool, and the neighbourhood was so cool I wanted to start looking for jobs in Charlotte.  Seriously.  If you get a chance, check this joint out."}
{"text":"I love this joint. I finally ventured into the South end location after checking out the Plaza location only once. Being mid day Monday, there were a few people there which meant faster service for me-yay!

I like the set up of this location much more than the Plaza location and absolutely love the outdoor patio. Sometimes I just want a fresh, hearty sandwich or wrap and this will be my new go to. I got the Mid Eastern wrap on a spinach/herb tortilla and it was fabulous. It could've had more flavor but it kept me full for awhile so in my book, that's money well spent. The cashier was friendly as well, I was telling him how excited I am that they have one in that location since it's a lot closer to me and he gave me the low down on all that they offer (Including brunch which I am stoked to try). And they open at 630A which is just awesome since I am a morning person living in the South where many things don't open until later.

I see myself day drinking here in the future!"}
{"text":"I really love Common Market. It has everything one could need: great hot food, great prepared food, great snacks, great beer selection, great coffee. The variety of clientele never fails to fascinate. 

I've had a number of different things from CM:
-Vegan breakfast with tempeh bacon and grits - pretty good. I'm just not one for savoury breakfast and not a huge grits fan. Others who like those things will definitely dig this.
-Vegan burrito - hot dang this was delicious. It was a lunch special and it was just delectable. 
-Veggie sandwich - hard to do wrong! Yummy and refreshing.
-Chocolate-covered animal crackers - these things are ADDICTIVE. I was going in weekly to get a bag and had to stop because I ate too many. But now...I think the time is nigh. 
-Snickerdoodle-flavored coffee beans - definitely a weirder choice but it was quite good. 

I'm not a huge beer person but I recognize that their selection is extensive. I appreciate that you can come here at any hour of the day and there will be lots of people around and there is always food available. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks. They do it all! And they truly embody the Plaza Midwood spirit. Keep it up, y'all."}
{"text":"Common market is great. It has so many varieties of drinks that you can buy for food truck fridays or whatever else you're going to. Or.. you can just chill in the back and hang out. The gritty feel helps you escape that corporate feel that seems to plague most venues these days."}
{"text":"Been a long time fan - dropping by to grab a sandwich after yoga class at Arrichion (the CM by Southend is better, I think) -- the grilled tofu with cheese is an amazing sandwich. Always friendly service, both at the cafe and behind the counter. 

I love you can buy alcoholic beverages in the fridge and consume them on the premises. A concept Europeans haven´t got yet:) The selection is as good as it gets. Something for everything. When I asked about ciders, then swung me around a corner. Also a wine lovers haven -- asked specifically to recommend wines from Napa/Sonoma region before heading out there, and the lady gave me tons of great recommendation (where I actually visited the wineries of!)

Can´t say how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"A few years ago, I wrote an article for the Charlotte Observer about where to take family and friends visiting from out of town and high on my list was the Common Market.  

It's a cool little neighborhood place filled to the brim with lovely beers, wines, juices and sodas, as well as sandwiches & food (from their own deli), interesting munchies and a bevy of novelty candies, toys and merch.  I love the patio - it's gone through some major changes since the beginning, some of which has made it more difficult to hang out back there, but I dig it nonetheless.  It can be a little dirty sometimes, but that comes with the territory when you have many people coming and going all day... even though I think the customers should clean up after themselves out of respect for who might be sitting there next....

Keeping me from giving the full five-star treatment is something that is not really the CM's fault.  Sometimes I don't really want to go there because of how crowded and noisy the place can be with people wearing fake glasses and tight jeans.  I never know when the right time to go is.  You might think its safe to go on a Monday night, and you get there and find it's so damn crowded that you can't continue with your mellow hangout plans.  C'est la vie! 

But still, I love the Common Market!"}
{"text":"A HIDDEN GEM with so many options to choose from!  I only wish the kitchen was open later.  I am sure as Charlotte continues to grow in popularity their hours will expand, especially considering the proximity to uptown."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is funky and eclectic from the appearance to the patrons and the music and the store/bar/coffee house.  It is a great place to hang out with friends, just people watch, meet new people, have a beer or get coffee, grab a deli sandwich.  The have a wide selection of craft beers and some seasonal beers on tap.  The Midwood area is awesome and this place is one of the reasons."}
{"text":"LOVED the Californian sandwich on multigrain bread. With a bottle of sauvignon blanc at a picnic table in the sunshine on the patio, my friends and I really really enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"I used to go here often when I lived in South End.  sometimes too crowded, but it's a shame this will be closing."}
{"text":"This was the best Cuban Sandwich I've ever had.  The place has a great funky look and lots of friendly staffers.  One day I'll had back to that cute little beer bar that was a nice surprise.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've been to the Common Market in Southend several times now and it's a great place to get some coffee, beer or a good bottle of wine. The choices for beer are endless from cases, to six packs to tall boys. There's a great patio outside that has music and beer tasting of local brews. You can also get the deli sandwich and single desert if necessary. My only complaint and the reason I held back one extra star is because they don't carry milk. I needed it the other day for a recipe and was out so I ran here and, ugh...nothing. Offer me  half gallon of the white stuff and I'll raise it to 4 stars. Until then, I'll always return for my beer/wine and coffee needs."}
{"text":"One of my favourite small deal places to go in charlotte. They have what seems like a endless variety of fun little snacky food that appeals to people who are just looking to lounge around and, on occasion, listen to some live music. The acts they are pulling in are mostly local people who would rank at best \"open mic\" level of performance but as long as you don't go with super high expectations you will have a good time. They also have a good beer selection and if you are looking to drink cheap the domestics are reasonably priced. I have only eaten there a couple times but the food I would say is mid grade and priced reasonably. They do have free beer and wine tasting which will give you the chance to sample some different brands at times."}
{"text":"If you are wondering where to go if you are in Plaza Midwood look no further. The Common Market is a staple for the area. They have a little bit of everything in there! The inside has so much going on. There is a place to order food, a huge section of it reminds me of a convince store. There are baked goods, candy bars, chips, gum, etc! Then in the back of the store there is a large selection of craft beers and wine that you can buy to go. They also have a bar area where you can order a beer on draft or have a nice glass of wine! 

My boyfriend and I did the wine tasting one evening and it was fun! The man that facilitated our tasting was nice and friendly. He explained each wine in detail and you could tell that he is well versed in the subject of wine! It was refreshing. 

One area of improvement would be the bathrooms. It is a hit or a miss if they are clean or not. There are only 2 bathrooms available, so the line can get quite long! The last time I went one bathroom had some gross stuff on the inside back part of the toilet and the other bathroom had such a strong smell of urine that I couldn't even go in there and that's saying a lot for me!! But like I said, you never know what they will be like because one time I went and they were fairly clean! Just prepare yourself! 

Overall, if you live in Charlotte (or are visiting) and you are looking for a place to visit that is special in Charlotte you need to stop by!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. 
One of the best things about living in South End is definitely living so close to Common Market. Mini review: if you haven't been, go. 

Its an awesome little eclectic shop. I'll start with the deli - their menu is simple but great. The staff is friendly, the food is always fresh, and even when its decently crowded, its pretty quick. They also have freezers with some great side items such as risottos, chicken salads, pastas, and different ravioli options AND delicious looking deserts! 

They also have, and what they're well known for, is their great extensive beer, cider, and wine selection. You can buy great local and hard to find 6 packs and individual beers. You can also find a great bottle of wine out of their really comprehensive selection and you won't be disappointed. On top of that they offer wine and beer tastings - which are great. 

They also serve King of Pops, which I love and and are great to grab on the go when walking around South End. ALSO, (so many also's because this place has it all) they have a lot of gluten free, vegan, vegetarian snacks and treats throughout the store. I have tried a few and always been pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I have to say I have had MANY good nights here!!! The wine is cheap the crowd is different but fun and if your in the mood for good different beers this is a good spot!! I love sitting outside in the alley on a nice night!! Cant wait for CM to open in Southend April 1st!!!"}
{"text":"Awe-inspring beer selection!!! It even rivals the craft beer selection in megastores like Total Wine.

VERY well-edited market selection as well - I was very impressed that one could find fresh local handmade pastas (filled and not) & sauces, regional handmade mustards, homemade hummus, fresh baked local breads, and even local cheese in such a tiny storefront.

The sandwiches are made on the same local bread and are hearty, cheap, and quality. 

I would definitely come back here for a cheap meal and a good beer in a really fun environment if I find myself in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"My favorite casual place. Great outdoor seating. Good micro brew selection. Live music or DJ often. My favorite chair is the broken one with deer print seat."}
{"text":"I only go about once a year when visiting a friend but if I didn't live 887 miles away I would be there a few times a week. The sandwich selection is great- even for vegetarians! The fact that you can grab a single beer out of the cooler yourself to go with your sandwich amazes me."}
{"text":"Night life say what??? I never realized just how lively Common Market gets after dark. If the two guitar and a flute eclectic indie band playing on this Saturday night and the varied mix of semi-hipster (but not in a bad way) people in the outdoor patio is representative of the typical atmosphere, I'm in love!
Ample parking in all directions, lots of good food within walking distance. Worth a stop in for sure!"}
{"text":"You just need to check it out for yourself.  A great convenient place to grab some beer to go or even drink it there.

The front area used to look a little divey, but they redid it not too awful long ago.  Now they have a nice patio out front and its just more inviting in general.  When you walk in the door you immediately notice all the booze in the back.  But wait, there's more.  If you walk to your left you'll see an awesome deli that has limited hours, but they have premade food in the coolers whenever.  If you would have walked to your right, you would have seen some awesome selections of coffee as well as Kombuchas and other similar items.  I love visiting for all these things, but the booze it what normally draws me in.

As per the booze.  They have a great selection of wine and sake, even a better selection of beer.  Not only are the coolers full of all kinds of diverse beers, there is even beer on tap.  Not something you find at your average convenience store.  The taps rotate, so there is no reason to mention what was on last time i was there.  Like I said, you just need to check it out for yourself.

Bottom line. I can't really explain this place.  Just GO!  Drink on the cheap, make new friends, and just enjoy the vibe."}
{"text":"I had candy and water in my hand with 4 other customers before midnight and we were told we had to put our items back to leave.   This place looked cool but it turned out to be a bunch of hipster angst.  Cool story hipsters.   Staff here were big POS's especially the cat with the horrible leather jacket.  Unless you want to be a victim of high school revenge then don't go to this wack establishment."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the CM. It was easy enough to find but horrible in terms of parking! I ended up driving around the lot a few times and still not getting a spot! Eventually I scored a space on the street but it's something I'll keep in mind for future trips. 

I like the eclectic vibe of the place. Beer and wine in the front, deli in the back and patio right out the side door. I can definitely tell this place would be really cool in the Summer. There was a long line for the deli so decided against trying anything today but did find some excellent (discounted) wine. Yay! 

I'm looking forward to trying the food and visiting the CM again really soon!"}
{"text":"Common Market gets 5 stars from me.  I've never really been to a place that is so diverse from the people to the establishment itself!  It's a great deli and they always have something for the vegans.  My favorite part of CM is the alcohol selection, especially since you can drink on site.  They have a small bar area where you can get draft beer and the taps are always rotating.  There is also a large cooler filled with beers from all over the world.  It's wonderful to find a great beer without any prior knowledge of it's existence.  The wine selection is also good.  I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I've been given great recommendations any time I've asked the staff.  The best part of all of this is you can pay retail prices for your booze and drink it there.  It's nice they're usually bumping some good tunes too (at least for my taste in music).  Where else can you chill out at a place with a bottle of great wine for 10 bucks?  The people watching is just fabulous at this place too...hipsters, hippies, 9-5'ers, bums, babies, you name it.  Cheap drinking and great people watching.  Love it.

Oh forgot to mention they have free wine and beer tastings, live music on the patio, and it's also a convenience store......Remember, I said it was diverse!"}
{"text":"What a fun, eclectic, happening little spot. I've been to common market twice for lunch and just to hang out. It's a great laid back spot to hang out with friends, grab a beer, have some lunch, or stop in for a six pack. No one here ever seems to be in a rush to do anything. 

Very eclectic crowd which makes it what it is: hipsters, hippies, business people, dinosaurs, zombies...everyone is welcome here and everybody always seems to be having a great time. As a note though, the crowd does seem to be a little more hum...tame.... than the Plaza Midwood location.

Wine Wednesdays... wine tastings on the porch and Thursdays offer FREE beer tastings. Come early, it fills up pretty quick! The have rotational selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have an impressive selection of beer and specialty beverages for purchase inside.

As for the deli food, neither of my sandwiches (Turkey Capri Panini and BLT) I have been blown away by but both were pretty good. They also have ready made sandwiches as well as pre made bakery items in addition to the miscellaneous chips and other groceries.

Come check this place out, bop around the store and see what trinket and goodies they have!"}
{"text":"Lurves me some Common Market (4.5 stars!) The main thing to recommend this place is their extensive and impressive beer selection. They literally have something for every season/taste In winter I was warming up with some stouts and now that summer has rolled around I'm kicking back and enjoying a nice hefeweizen. 

After you've picked up your food/beer you have the option of leaving or enjoying it on their tiny tiny back patio. I always choose the latter as I enjoy socializing with my buddies and watching the super diverse crowd that is rolling through. (They're also watching us. An older lady told my friend and I that we were \"very pretty boys\"..thanks?)

Often they have live music that is also a treat.

The price is right. Service is meh but it's a gas stations (basically) so whatever and the overall vibe is pretty cool. Definitely a spot I recommend."}
{"text":"good samiches, good staff, good beer,
everything is lovely, but seriously people, must you all hang out at the common market 24/7? get a life! sheeesh. (you know who you are..)"}
{"text":"This place is fun, eclectic, and the food is great! I'm also able to find specialty items here that I cannot find anywhere else. The staff is very friendly, too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Finally a place where health food nuts and junk food nuts can come together.  Wide selection of chips, beef jerky, power bars, soda, energy drinks and nonsequeters such as bacon flavored toothpics.  The deli has fresh sandwiches and wraps which is their strong point.

Phoned in orders never come out right.  So it's better to order in than to call ahead.  If you stand there and watch them make it, it will be perfect.  They have seating if you want to have your snack and soda pronto.  And they also sell coffee, wine, and beer."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite sandwich shops of all time. You can't go wrong with the supreme pimento cheese sandwich. The service is always friendly, and they also have a bunch of really cool daily special sandwiches."}
{"text":"Really awesome, super eclectic place with many options for beer, wine, and snacks. I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious pimento cheese spread and the chocolate chip cookies were AMAZING!!! The sandwiches are just ok, but everything else made it well worth the trip! The only complaint I had was the amount of smoking in the outside patio area - not at all pleasant for non-smokers."}
{"text":"Got a to go order here for the first time the other day. We were pleasantly surprised. The chicken salad deluxe sandwich was delicious and the portion was equally as great. My friend got a Rueben and was very pleased with the taste. We wish they would make the other location come here for training!!!"}
{"text":"I will tell you I did not try the food. This place isn't really a restaurant. It's a deli, with a distinct left wing attitude. There are no tables, except outside. 
I drove there because the food matched my 83 yr old aunt likes. Namely soup and other vegetarian fare. There are no indoor tables to eat at. 
So, if you like your food in a loud, very left wing bunch of young adults, this might be your place to pick up food to take home. 
For information only, weapons are prohibited inside, but that's their right. It's my right to never go near the place again. The only thing missing was a Che poster.
Again, because I'm an evil right winger, I did not sample the food. It might be delicious, and the place was packed. I'll never know."}
{"text":"Cool place to grab a variety of food.

I grabbed a cold brew coffee and a donut from the bakery -- both were top notch."}
{"text":"Common Market is anything but common.  It's fantastic, I had delicious black bean soup the other day, worth five stars alone on the soup.  Then add the great, friendly staff, the selection of beer & wine, prepared food, the music mix and all the kitsch, I'm in love. And you know that means you, Rob R. 

PS-they are always really cool when I want to take photos too.  I've even had a bride in Common Market drinking Prosecco.  I know this surprises you.

Great neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"The Common Market is one of my favorite places in Charlotte to hang out for many reasons. It's in an up and coming neighborhood in Charlotte and right off the light rail. It has some of the best vegan food options in town. My favorite is the straight jacket wrap--tofu slices, spinach, tomato, cucumber, peppers, onion, carrot and I add sriracha and vegan thousand island for a little kick. They even offer up a variety of large and in charge vegan cupcakes that are always difficult for me to resist. The greatest part about The Common Market is their selection of bottled and draft beer. This is one of the few places that satisfies my food and dessert cravings as well as my husbands thirst for beer. It's the perfect combination!

The South End location has a sizable outdoor patio that's fairly comfortable but I would only recommend lounging outside if you enjoy choking on cigarette smoke. I almost forgot to mention every Sunday they have a vegan brunch option that's always delicious like french toast or cajun tofu with grits.

There are so many things going on at The Common Market you just have to check it out for yourself. And hopefully you like hipster skateboarders."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for well over 10 years now, back when the Deli used to close after lunch. I am now back in the Charlotte area and so glad to see that they are open later! It is such a neat, funky place to grab a bite to eat, and now they have added patio seating I see."}
{"text":"I was looking for something different to do on a Saturday night and heard about local bands playing at The Common Market and thought, why not?

The place itself is unique to me.  Coming from New York, there weren't many deli/bodegas where people could buy cases of beer straight out of the fridge to go drink in the sitting area outside.  That's pretty cool.  Their prices are reasonable too.  I got two drafts of beer for around $9.

Beware: if you are not a hipster and if you don't like hipsters, this is NOT your place.  As we walked in to people smoking outside in their ripped shirts and jeans and old dockers, I immediately felt overdressed.  And I was wearing a tank top and a long skirt, nothing fancy.  Everyone has long hair of some sort whether its shaggy long or spiked up in a huge mohawk.  And the live music turned out to be a guy in a furry homemade suit (a hacked up teddy bear attached to a bearskin rug) singing with a puppet and then a local band that was using a trash can with a tambourine taped to it as a drum.

It was definitely an interesting scene, and can be fun if you're in the right mindset, but if being around a lot of people who are trying hard to look like they're not trying hard is not for you, you may want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was a Sunday morning and I was craving a turkey sandwich really bad.  Looked up on my handy, dandy Yelp app and pointed me here. I've been here before to get drinks, pick up some chips but not really to try their food.  I went for their chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty good so no complaints!  It was quite the hangout on a Sunday morning - the outside patio was packed, so we hung out inside to eat.  Maybe it's the New Yorker in me, but felt a bit weird to be hanging out a convenience store, but I guess that's the charm of it :)"}
{"text":"Common Market is my \"go to\" spot when I want a simple sandwich & a bottle (or 2) of the pink sparkling sake (that Soul Gastrolounge serves). My favorite sandwich is the 'BLT Deluxe' - bacon, lettuce, tomato, white american cheese & pickles - so yummy!
I love the layout of the place, you can grab snacks, \"adult beverages\" & soft drinks / water juice. They also serve coffee.
All the staff there are very nice & friendly. 
I absolutely adore the outside patio area. It's great to sit out there on nice sunny days."}
{"text":"Here in Chicago we have plenty of BYOB restaurants, but nothing can top the experience of Charlotte's Common Market. I have fond memories of my visits to the Common Market over the years. March of '05 was my first visit. There, I purchased my first bottle of Pom and my first bottle of wine. On that same day, I learned that filling an empty Pom bottle with red wine makes for a perfect disguise. Since then, I always make it a point to rally some friends together and head here to drink in their quaint courtyard. Not only is the beer and wine selection incredible, and not only do they provide glasses for you to immediately begin drinking, they also have an fantastic community board that can help guide an outsider to the best nightlife in the city."}
{"text":"Wow, I did not know what to think about this place when I walked up to it, but became very impressed once I walked in. We gravitated to the bar and had a glass of their excellent house draft. The coolers are filled with beers and wines that you can purchase and drink out on the patio. What a wonderful idea, mega selection and save some money by buying a six pack and splitting it with your friends. Great coffee and breakfast options are on offer. This makes for a great hub for the neighborhood, I am very all in on this place."}
{"text":"I loved the culture at The Common Market.  Everyone there was very nice, the sandwiches were great, and there were by no means any shortage of beverages to choose from.  Deeps selections of premium beer, wine, sodas, waters, etc.

I ordered a BLT sandwich on 9 grain bread which was very tasty.  I also bought Dirty sweet potato ships and a low calorie watermelon soda to go with it.  It was a reasonably-priced, healthy meal that I couldn't argue with.

By the way, they played my some great music outside where we ate.  My coworkers disagreed.  Will be back here soon for lunch."}
{"text":"I finally made it to The Common Market after working in walking distance for the last couple of years. I had a tasty sandwich and really loved the patio...they did seem really busy not sure if its always this way but it was prime time for lunch - I got my sandwich fast but my friend had to wait quite awhile for hers. Not a problem though I will be back...the staff was super friendly recommended a unique drink celery soda (think it was Dr. Browns) I will also recommend it... similar to sprite without being uber sweet. 

I did browse by the wine section briefly how could you not and noticed they carry my favorite little pink cans of Sophia Coppola sparkling wine major + for me."}
{"text":"Why hello, common market, and look at your stellar craft beer selection! 

I must say, common market is an amazing local staple. Half of the fun is educating yourself on the astute choices of brews to choose from. You just seem to feel like branching out and trying a micro/craft brew that you've never heard of before. Or, for the hipster at heart, grab a PBR and join the crowd. Their selection varies, so be sure to check back for seasonals and different locales to be featured/available.

I love the giant drums of beer and glass bottled coke throughout the shop as well. Makes it feel less like grocery-esque for a quick grab n' go. 

The deli is a phenomenon. Friendly for the typical sandwich aficionado and the vegan/veggie types. The flavors and combinations are endless and the deft hands of the deli staff move the lines faster than other places. 

Gotta love the niche humor and accessories/toys for sale. Always good for a gag gift or oddly celebrated white elephant party in July. 

Something for everyone here. Grab a six pack to go, a draught with friends or snackage for the road. 

Never a dull moment for this plaza midwood hearth. Always a pleasure to visit."}

Only difference between this location and plaza midwood is the outdoor seating. Gotta love those nights out in southend sitting outside. Another perk? There's an apple tree in the courtyard. You can pick the apples and eat them! There is usually an apple picker next to the tree, so pick some when they're ripe! Really fun for friends and family visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is super hipster. Think of it as a NY bodega filled with vegan/hipster conscious wording to attract a certain group of people. 

The market area I skimmed through because the craft beer and random stuff won't concern me during my trip.

I did however go to the deli side to order the Reuben sandwich. Which I thought was pretty good."}
{"text":"We came here during a weekend stay in Charlotte and this, by far was my favorite spot. The vegan options around town were almost non existent, and healthy vegan options were even more scarce. It's a little hard to find, since it's kinda tucked away and it was pretty busy for a late Sunday afternoon. We were lucky to snag a table in the courtyard where we enjoyed our very vegan, and super healthy wraps and black eye pea salad. It's quite the liquor store, and I was happy they had Lagunitas IPA on hand. Our one and only complaint was the smoking in the courtyard. I know it's not really a restaurant, but trying to eat while breathing in smoke was a little icky. 

If I ever return to Charlotte, I would definitely return to the Commons."}
{"text":"Reviewing Common Market on Yelp seems almost like a right of passage. Will I be the first yelper to extoll the virtues of this deli/convenience store/bar? By no means, but do I honestly value this local gem? You bet your bottom dollar! Common Market's strength is that it can be many things depending on what you need. 

Hungry for a meal? Go into the deli and you can choose from one of their concoctions (I recommend the reuben on rye, no mustard) or make up one of your own. Vegetarian? They have plenty of options for you as well (The mid-eastern wrap is particularly tasty). 

Just looking for a snack to quell the (possibly late night) munchies? They have all kinds of tasty chips, pretzels, cookies and soft drinks to satisfy.

Oh, you wanted a slightly stronger drink? Well you are sure in the right place. Chilled, room temp, individual, 6-packed, in a case or on tap, Common Market has a beer selection to astound. Whether it's a PBR night or you are looking for your favorite craft brew they are prepared. I should mention they also sell wine, but with so many unique beers I tend to forget.

Did you want more of a destination than a grab and go? No problem. They've got tables inside and out on their patio. They have weekly live music performances. Or you could just pick up a copy of the paper and do the crossword.

Worried about parking? They have spaces in the front, a lot in the back, there is street parking and a large lot around the corner. Oh, and they have bike racks out back.

Do be advised that they have a $5 credit/debit minimum, so have cash if you are just grabbing a snack or drink."}
{"text":"This place is awesome
My go to breakfast place for healthy food early in AM!! 
Try the Dragon Slayer.  Eric does a killer job whipping up the eggs!"}
{"text":"Friendly, knowledgable staff about  a great selection of wine and beer. Great sandwiches and awesome patio!"}
{"text":"What a great place. It's a little overwhelming when you first walk in, trying to figure out what's going on and what you're supposed to be doing...is it a market, a bar, a coffee shop, a deli?  All of the above.  I was greeted at the door and got a quick explanation about how it all worked.  The Spicy Turkey sandwich was delicious and the guys behind the counter were perfect.  I wanted a local beer and they pointed me in the right direction (it was soo good), and broke down a six pack for my single brew.  Just...great.  Wish I had this place down the street from my house."}
{"text":"Common Market is the freakin' jam!  If you're in Plaza-Midwood and scoping out a convenience store/coffee house/beer market/bakery, you should visit this place.  It's practically a hipster general store.

They have a lunch counter that is packed at lunchtime.  Your typical lunch counter staples, like reuben on rye, clubs, and paninis, but with fancier breads, meats, and cheeses.   They have a convenience store selection of chips and homemade cookies/brownies to complete your lunch. Did I mention that they are several brews of coffee?  Plus, its only a $1 if you bring your own mug!  The beverage selection is out of this world!  Many foreign brands with many, many syllables.  

Common Market is also loaded with hipster trinkets;  like dress-up Jesus magnets, cooler and more socially conscious-than-thou bumper stickers, and \"papers\"...he he.  So if you want to get your lunch on, caffeine on, or just roll your own...this is your joint."}
{"text":"Common Market is still my favorite place in Charlotte.  I just wanted to update and note that the sandwiches are always unbelievably delicious from the deli.  Please, please, please, PLEASE try the tuna (unless you're vegetarian).  It's a \"super secret\" recipe, and it's super delicious and addictive.  There's something about it that sets it apart from any tuna sandwich I've ever had.  (I happen to know the secret, thanks to a friend who is a former employee of the deli over at SouthEnd, but I ain't tellin'!)  Try it for yourself and see if you can figure it out!

The grilled cheese (with your choice of bread and TWO CHEESES!!!) is also amazing, and perfect for those mornings when you maybe had a little bit too much to drink the night before and need to soak up the alcohol residue with buttery, grilled bread and rich, gooey cheese.  

There are also tons of other sandwiches, and options for creating your own.  Omnivore or herbivore can find their pleasure here.  

No matter where I live or move to, Common Market will always hold a very special place in my heart.  It's a delicious deli, eclectic convenience stop, pleasant hang-out spot, and beloved Home Base forever."}
{"text":"The sport here is people watching. Either you are participating in the game or cheering from the sidelines. There's not much original I can add in terms of basic information. Common Market is a convenience store of beers, wines, an array of non alcoholic beverages, snacks, goofy toys and makers of tasty sandwiches. 

Whether you prefer Southend or the Plaza-Midwood location is likely more a function of convenience in distance and the time of day you most frequently visit as the crowd you'll find at a particular hour will change. Where the plaza mid wood location has more indoor seating, where Southend shines is it's courtyard.

That's the essence of my opening sentence. The wifi isn't super fast and I've forgotten the password, I'm sure it's been left as a yelp tip. The courtyard is really a special place, at times a quiet repose for introspection about it's unique architectural details and others raucous cavern barely containing it's human contents. Either way you'll have a good time on your visit."}
{"text":"Common Market in Southend has all the charms of the Plaza Midwood location...but with a bigger, open patio around back. Whether you're winding up for an evening in Southend or winding one down, add Common Market to your list.  Oversized Christmas lights, solid indie rock/reggae soundtrack, and the ability to interact with folks in an environment with absolutely no pretense.  I have yet to visit a weekend establishment in Charlotte where its so easy to strike up a conversation with a stranger.  It's hard to get a set indoors on Thursdays or the weekends, but this doesn't deter hard-core \"slacker\" types.  There's never a cover charge and dress codes are irrelevant...just a good place to loiter after dark."}
{"text":"I love this place. Vegan options in the deli! Stumbled here Sunday morning to realize they have their own brunch menu. I'm assuming it changes weekly, as I had never noticed it before (I'd only been on weekdays up to this point).

Beer and wine and mimosas are available. There were a few different groups on the patio, to include a couple playing the guitar and flute. The vibe is awesome and the people I've run into are just looking for their own little slice of heaven on the CM patio.

Great for lunch and brunch. I'll update when I finally check out the evening vibe."}
{"text":"Yes, I know.. this place doesn't need yet another five star review.. but I just had to chime in.. I used to live about two blocks from there and its one of my most favorite treats to give myself!!    
All the facts have been reported, but for sheer enjoyable food and great atmosphere check it out."}
{"text":"Having just moved to Plaza Midwood from Los Angeles, I have to say, I love the unpretentiousness of this place! It's right across the street from my new place, so I'm there almost everyday. I love everything about it. The owner is very cool, and I dig that they play great music. The other day I heard Op Ivy and it made me feel like I was in high school again! I'm a musician, so I'm definitely interested in checking out the bands on weekends. Haven't done the \"beer\" night either, but sounds totally fun. They have an amazing selection of beer and sake and their deli is always super good for lunch. i recommend the grilled cheese with tomato or the California. So yeah, it's a bunch of hipsters maybe, but I LOVE this place. It's totally original!"}
{"text":"Cute place where you can get wine, food, and healthy, gluten-free or vegan items.

This is a sort of boho, vegan, hipster, earthy place that combines a market with a deli, a patio and a \"Scene\".

If you are looking for a place to hang out on a warm afternoon with your friends, this might be a good idea. You can buy wine or beer from the market here and enjoy it on the patio (they allow dogs out there - good for some people, not for others, depending on your preference) You can enjoy some snacks from the market or get something from the deli.

The wine mark up was reasonable and they have quite a few fun choices on the shelves. 

They are across from where Food Truck Friday happens - so a lot of people pop in for booze and wine before heading over to the food trucks."}
{"text":"The CM provides a nice alternative for a casual night out. All of the eats are delectable; the cigarettes are sold in packs and as singles (perfect for the social smoker who can't quite kick the habit); they've got plenty of drink options; and they're staffed with some NICE folks. The patio here is the draw and its communal atmosphere lends itself to an air of intimacy you certainly dont find in a bar. It's nice to sit and drink and talk to people you may or may not know at the table beside you. 

Oh, and they have music Saturday nights. When a lazy Saturday afternoon drink turned into several hours of quiet inebriation, I was startled back to sobriety by an acoustic doom metal show-- that was outrageously original in its satirical hilarity. In general, the shows are acoustic and the music they showcase is good and local.

BONUS: (1) Apple tree with tasty/tart green apples.  (2)Dog water bucket for the pooch.  (3) Cook out Sundays!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Charlotte, and when I did,  this was my favorite place to hang out!  Now I come back to this city twice a year, and every time I make it a point to return to this establishment.

I've watched this place grow from a typical convenience store to a now bar/hang out/deli/convenience store, complete with beers on tap and occasional live music in the alley.  The concept of this business is amazing!  It's a true melting pot inside with something for everyone including unique gifts, pins and magnets, as well as local and traditional snacks and national or micro brew beers and wine which you can purchase and consume on site, either inside or in the alley spot in the back.  Inside the music is right on, with a typical indie flair.

My only complaint is that it's become too popular...but that's what happens to great businesses.

The eclectic crowd and atmosphere coupled with a great selection of your everyday favorite microbrew makes for a great night indeed!"}
{"text":"Funky little place. Loved the laid back vibe..you can go into the market and buy a 6 pack or bottle of wine or just a glass if you choose and head outside to enjoy the patio. Also had a little sandwich place in the back that looked delicious. While we were there a band was playing. Great place to hang out with a bunch of friends listen to music and not pay a fortune for drinks."}
{"text":"Im from CT and I grew up going to NY Style delis. I like a HUGE selection of sodas and drinks, a HUGE selection of alcohol, TONS of snacks, odd things to east and GOOD sandwiches. This place has it all! Its such a great place to hang out at 2pm or 12am. You can drink in the store or on the patio. Everyone is SUPER friendly and helpful! I love love LOVE going here and I make the 20 min drive from South Carolina for it. This is the only place I know of like it in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The best place to stop after a night out in Charlotte. Great food selection and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Common Market is one of my favorite spots in Charlotte because it's pretty much perfect for every occasion. I've been there late night, for Sunday brunch, with my mom, for a birthday, picking up a six pack for a party, grabbing a sandwich for lunch, etc. The sandwiches are fresh and hefty. You definitely get your money's worth. Breakfast items are also value sized and taste like your mom (who is a good cook) just whipped it up in her kitchen especially for you. The brunch menu is ever changing, with items like french toast and eggs benedict making appearances. This spot is also my go-to for vegetarian and vegan options. Wine tastings, a good array of craft beers and consistently awesome DJ's invite you to kill a few hours on the patio, where the scene is ripe for adorable dog spotting."}
{"text":"I like this one better than the Plaza-Midwood one.  The people here are less hipster-ish and the patio is much nicer.

Both common markets are my favorite bottle shops in Charlotte and if you enjoy trying random beers with friends this is your place.  Grab a 6 pack and ask for a bucket of ice to keep them cold, sit outside on the patio and life is good."}
{"text":"First time here! Based on all of the reviews I decided to go with the Tree Hugger wrap (subbed hummus for cream cheese AND added bacon). Conclusion: amazing.....different tastes and textures created a culinary masterpiece. The bacon brought the wrap to the next level. They serve freshly pressed juices, kombucha, any beer you can imagine (both in bottles and on tap), wine and mimosas! What isn't there to love about this place?!"}
{"text":"Love the common market. When you walk in, it's full of grit and goodies. I love getting a craft soda and trying something new. Last time I ordered a turkey panini from the deli and added pimento cheese and pickles. It was amazing! The staff is super friendly. I was a bit nervous as I wasn't dressed in a grandpa sweater and only have two piercings but both the deli guys and the girl at the register were very nice. I saw people on the porch who had bought juices and champagne and were making their own mimosas. Thought this was a great idea. Parking was available when we were there."}
{"text":"The staff is great with outstanding information about the beer. 

Loved the music playing outside on the patio. 

Beer selection was very good and had local Carolina offerings. 

Really cool vibe outside and inside. May not be for everyone but it's a great place to see for yourself.

{"text":"This place is great. I love coming by for a good sandwich with a coffee or beer, both are awesome. I always take my visitors here and they love it every time. I will miss this place when I leave Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Came here while my car was getting fixed. This place is pretty consistent. Sandwiches are clever, and high-quality. You have to get chips and drink a-la-carte, so expect $10pp when its all said and done. Staff friendly. On cold days, there isn't much inside dining space. If in the area, you gotta at least try this place"}
{"text":"Meh. 

I come here every once in a while because of the convenience factor, but I have yet to have a really great sandwich.  

People seem to love this place, would even consider it a staple of Charlotte.  Which is probobly why they get away with selling over priced bottles of wine."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is great whenever you just want to hang out, relaxed with some wine. I had tried the deli sandwichs and they are GREAT! I love the variety of beers they have (even though im not a huge beer drinker) and wine too! The only thing that i would add would be some heater for the outside patio since in the winter time it gets EXTREMELY cold to hang out outside and the inside is always full. Overall its a MUST GO place, music and staff are pretty awesome"}
{"text":"Been going on/off for years.   Nothing else like it in Charlotte.   Love the vibe outside in the alley connecting to Camden. 

PS:  They make panninis!!"}
{"text":"A perfect example of Trump's shithole if there ever was one.  Unfortunately, too many aristocrats think, \"lets fire up the bulldozer and build an altar in our own image.\"  And it's happening all over Charlotte.  

So before someone conspires for something grander, I suggest you meander CM's aisles, engage it's patrons, listen to its employees, grab a sandwich and ponder it's value.  Places like CM add distinction to neighborhoods, adding culture and charm (OK, the bathrooms are not charming opting instead for artfully layered, unique reading material).

Wanna experience Plaza Midwood before it's too late?  Way up on my \"Give 'em a whirl\" meter.  When finished here drop into the Thirsty Beaver and order up a round of suds."}
{"text":"Nice little place to grab some picnic food and enjoy on their patio or get a drink and head to the food truck area across the way. It does get busy in there though and I witnessed one kid grab a 6 pack, without paying, and head to the patio to drink it. It seems a little hard to monitor all that goes on in this busy place. Lots of really great premade food, a deli for made to order food, and lots of choices of grab and go items. They also serve wines and beers by the glass. Parking could definitely improve, although I'm not sure how they could expand it."}
{"text":"I'm definitely going against the grain on this review compared to many others before me. I'm not quite sure what the fuss is about. Husband and I were driving around looking for someplace new to try...\"The Common Market has so many great reviews, let's do it.\" 

The parking lot is small, but we found a place to park. I thought, \"Wow, this place is hopping already. Can't wait!\" However, once we entered everything came to a screeching halt. It's a weird combination of convenience store meets deli meets poor college student's rental home. There's stuff EVERYWHERE and it's completely overwhelming. The deli is on the side and there's a little bell to ring when you want to order...apparently there's cooler places to be and people to hang with when they're not serving up sandwiches and soup. 

The atmosphere is not really chill and \"hippie-esce\" like I was anticipating. It was more edgy and raw, which was not appealing or inviting for my taste. The music was not laid-back, more like aggressive.

We grabbed a tea and headed out only to top it off with the cashier saying that they do not accept credit cards unless the sale was over $5. Grabbed some munchies to push us over the mark (one drink, one package of crackers for nearly $7 = robbery). Geez. 

Plus side: They do have a huge variety of beers and wines. Seems like people get pretty comfortable.

Downside: Not for me."}
{"text":"This location has a completely different feel than the Plaza Midwood location. Great patio, nice place to chill. I didn't feel like I was on exhibit when I walked in.

I guess it's pretty standard at CM that you have to spend over $5 or you'll get an extra charge on your credit cards. So take note all you plastic carriers. *Note jotted down* 

Last week they had the Tailgate Farmers Market set up in the patio/courtyard area. It was a very intimate setting and it seemed like a good fit. A couple Fridays ago they were having wine tastings too. Seems like this is a popular and diverse place! Give both locations a try and see which one fits you best!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Hippies, goths, weirdos, and my cracker preppy ass all in this place. There are tons of beers to pick from ( think of a convience store meets patio) and there was a guy there to help so my indecesiveness didn't take me 4 hours to pick a beer.  There was blood wrestling going on in the back and the girls were throwing down.  Also, if this place isn't working out Thomas St is right next door, though  i have never had a bad time here.  Lots of interesting people to meet"}
{"text":"Am I in the village in NYC or is this Charlotte?  Holy hipsters everywhere!  This place is way better than the other Common Market.  There a bunch of delicous beers to be had and I even found a Moses Action Figure!   Score!  I love the outside patio and there is always room to meet new people.  I will say that this place is way more fun in the summer than the winter because the patio is where its at."}
{"text":"Fresh deli sandwiches & wraps, salads and homemade soups. Very hipster environment. Loved the spicy turkey Panini as a wrap.  The lady taking my order was helpful. She asked if I wanted to add spinach so the wrap would be fuller b/c most people got it as a sandwich. Definitely would go back for a quick fresh lunch."}
{"text":"Let's see, I've been in Charlotte for over 4 years, and I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE COMMON MARKET UNTIL NOW! Please don't call the Police on me....

Very funky hippie/bohemian vibe in this place.....I was half expecting to get the Washington/Colorado treatment if you know what I mean....Uh hem. While I'm quite sure that NOBODY in this place is from my political side of the aisle, this IS a cool place to enjoy some beer or wine on the patio, and enjoy a deli sandwich (during the day anyway). 

What I was really blown away with was their really stellar wine and beer selection! Who would have thunk that such a small, funky place would carry such \"hard to find\" wine and beer selections! As \"the Wineguy,\" I was shocked to see many Oregon Pinot Noirs, some \"boutique\" Zinfandels, and even a Beaujolais Blanc! Not exactly a common wine....but apparently it is in the COMMON market!

Because I need more wine like a hole in the head, I left with a couple of bottles of Mexican Coke! (Uh, the SOFT drink......) Now for those of you in my age bracket (yes I'm old), this is how Coke USED to make their product....with CANE sugar! Now they use High Fructose Corn Syrup which while not bad (and CERTAINLY better than that sweet a$$ Pepsi), pure cane sugar ROCKS! So I bought both and there IS a taste difference! The Mexicans got it right folks.....Pure Cane Sugar WINS! WOO HOO!

Overall you just can't help but like this place......the guy behind the beer bar was cranky, but hey, it was late on a Monday night and I would have been cranky too. 

I do look forward to going back here....this time during the day OR when I decide to hit the Food Truck Rally!"}
{"text":"This place is dope. Breakfast is not often a meal you enjoy out- at least in my case. But rolling into Common Market and hitting the deli for breakfast should not be missed. They offer killer affordable breakfast sandwiches. Sunday they do homemade queso for your ranchero wrap and I guess topping anything you desire. I enjoyed their homemade pimento cheese In a wrap (ever had pimento cheese melted? Nope. Me either. It was yum) they offer tons of vegan and veg options and tons of ready made sides and wraps to go. And yeah a totally rad beer, wine and snack scene. However, I'm here to tell you that breakfast/brunch at the deli counter is not to be missed. Oh and they will do grits with pimento cheese too. Worth it. Take it to go or sit on their newly expanded patio."}
{"text":"It blows my mind that it has taken me this long to write a review of The Common Market.  I have been frequenting this place for what feels like decades.  Truly the only place of its kind in Charlotte.  The Common Market is your eclectic home-away-from-home type of place.  I can't really decide if it falls into the category of coffee shop, delicatessen, acid trip, museum or bakery.  Maybe all of the above.  It is the perfect spot to grab a cup of joe with friends, split a bottle of wine after work, or stop for a quick business meeting with a lively environment.  

The Awkward & the Awesome:
* Best coffee in Charlotte, hands down.  They have recently started creating their own!
* The décor.  Something out of Andy Warhol and the Drinking out of Cups youtube video.  Prepare to be amazed!
* The employees.  These people are some of the best I have met in Charlotte.  Shout out to Sarah & Chuck (the owner).
* I strongly believe the Common Market could have its own reality tv show. 
* A killer deli for breakfast/lunch/dinner + Vegan & Vegetarian options!  Chika chika yea!
* The gag gifts.  Greeting Cards, Bacon flavored toothpaste, raunchy magnets, cupcake dental floss, Jesus mugs and much, much more...
* Grape leaves.  Just do it.
* Beer, wine, tea, coffee, and every soda flavor ever made.
* The outside patio!  Dogs & smokers welcome.
* After hours events on the weekends (wine nights, poetry readings, etc)
* And so much more...

If you haven't visited The Common Market yet, I recommend getting over there as soon as humanly possible.  This place far surpasses anywhere else in the greater Charlotte area.  I would give it 10 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Staff was not as friendly as when went I went to the north store (why only the 3 stars...gave the north store 5) but great selection of beer and wines.  Heard rave reviews about the food but did not have time to try."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of this place on here and on beer advocate I was really looking forward to this place. Once I got there the place was not at all what I was expecting. Kind of a strange place with a deli, convenience store, beer/wine store, and a small bar/eating area. They had a few good beers on tap, and a ton of good bottled beer as well. 

That being said, the place seems a little disorganized, and there is not much in the way of seating. I had a question or two about some of the beers, and the employee that I talked to seemed to be annoyed that I had the nerve to bother him. Really the only thing that the place had going for it was the beer selection, and I would rather stick with Brawleys, especially given the difference in the level of service between the two..."}
{"text":"This place is super cool and I had no idea it was here. You go down this tiny alley way to get there. You first walk in a court yard with tables and chairs and people drinking and chatting. Then you walk into the market which has all sorts of stuff, all types of beer and wine, snacks, food. The people there are super nice. If you are the artsy type or the type that goes to NODA, you would love this place."}
{"text":"Everything you need in a neighborhood market!
Their sandwiches are great and cater toward all different foodie groups. You can go vegan, vegetarian or meat-lovin! They have draught beers, wines by the glass and a whole back room full of micro brews and fun wines that they will cork free of charge. 
The back patio is perfect for pretty days."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little find close to the Dilworth area in Charlotte. I've been here for lunch a few times and they custom make your sandwich/wrap to order. They have a eclectic variety of beverages and snacks as well. They also allow dogs indoors and out. Parking may be hard to find though so get here early."}
{"text":"So good. Soups, sandwiches, vegan cupcakes- all yummy."}
{"text":"I love the Common Market. They have a great beer/wine selection and a patio to hang out on and drink. Awesome deli. Cool toys and neat stuff for people who like bacon. It's my go to spot for switchblade combs."}
{"text":"Used to like this joint. But if you are coming from work, a business meeting, church, or just anywhere where you aren't dressed like a bum, the loser hipsters are kinda rude, both patrons and employees. Sorry I have some self respect and class ... Oh yeah, and a job."}
{"text":"I love this place! Thursdays offer FREE beer tastings! Be sure to stop by  

Food truck Fridays are off the hook too."}
{"text":"How has it taken me this long to discover the awesomeness of CM's deli. I always knew Common as the place to go for beer and look at the weird gag gifts - horse head mask anyone? Thanks, Bethany D. for helping me discover how great the Later Hater is. The breakfast sandwiches are awesome and the lunch ones aren't too shabby either. I have a love hate relationship with the slices of Carolina Pie Company pie they have in their coolers. I love to eat them but my waist hates it. If you frequent the CM for coffee, make sure to take them up on their buy 4 cups and get the 5th free deal. The funky vibe and tasty eats can't be beat."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Common. Super hipster and little dirty but an awesome spot. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing. The beverage selection is wonderful. Grab a beer and a sandwich and chill out on the back patio. 

I hate that this location will be closing... Thanks to all the development in the area. I know they are looking at a new spot! I'm sure it'll be just as cool."}
{"text":"Once we got the interweb up and running, the current wi-fi password says it all... \"igotsexypower\".  
The Southend location (NOT Dilworth) is a different scene than the one in the Wood.  Its a laidback atmosphere still, but you get more of the business casual regulars than Midwood hipsters.

The back patio is perfect for afternoon meetings.  Especially since they carry a nice selection of bottled and canned (who needs anything other than an ice cold PBR tallboy, honestly?) craft and macro-brew beers to tilt back.  They also have a few taps running for that tasty draft feeling.  The wine selection is pretty decent as well.

If the alcoholic thing is not your style, they have pretty much any of the happening new energy style or hi-tech hydration products to satisfy your thirst.

The deli is always cranking out some tasty vittles and I am always primed for a deluxe chicken salad sandwich.  I love their recipe and everything in this world is better with bacon.  The prepared desserts will throw you into that fantastic sugar coma.  I think there was a mocha espresso cheesecake that took me a few attempts to finish because of its richness.

For take out, its also one of the pit stops in the CLT where you can procure the ever so delectable Pasta & Provisions line.  Mmmmm... fresh pasta.

Usually, CM Southend is one of the stops on the Two Wheel Tuesday tour and there are sensation beergarten parties on the back patio regularly.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had been talking about going to Common Market for so long and finally did last weekend. When we first walked in I wasn't even sure where to go or what to do. It was nothing like I expected! 
If you are interested in getting food made you go in and take a left and you place your order there... they also have breakfast which I wasn't aware of before. You can get chips and other things in the market area as well. 
They also not only have a wide selection of drinks but also beers on tap which is awesome. If you aren't in the mood for beer you can always grab wine or even champagne and also some orange juice if you would like to make your own mimosa! 
They have two outdoor seating areas, one out front and one in the back that is a non smoking porch and totally covered. We ate out there and we really enjoyed it, it was much more quiet than the front area too. 
The guy who helped us with our beer was awesome too, he knew a lot about the kinds they offered and even gave us several samples to try before we ordered. We will def. be going back here regularly!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good sandwiches and beer selection. Was just at a party there this afternoon and it was a real good time. Love the laid back chill porch where dogs are welcome! Would recommend this for a beer, a meal or simply a good time."}
{"text":"Great place, so many cool local options for beer, drinks and even food. Juice bar and deli are fantastic with vegetarian and gluten free options and cool daily specials. Really friendly staff. I'd hang out here more if I didn't feel so out of place and gather a few odd stares from the crowd here, so I just stick to picking it up to go."}
{"text":"Common Market South End, not to be confused with Common Market in Plaza Midwood is great for drinking, being loud, and being merry. As an impromptu gathering shaped up after coffee and snacks in uptown began to emerge they were an awesome place to hang out.

Some may extoll the virtues of the Plaza Midwood location over South End's, but hey just I think they are basically the same except for the crowd. In the Midwood you've got grungy hipsters smoking outside and here you've got a more laid back crowd and that they certainly are! We were getting a bit tipsy off bottles of cheap beer, wine, and mimosas and they were very obliging of our raucous occasion!

The place is a little cleaner than Plaza Midwood's and roomier I think so it's great if you like being able to sit with your friends while you drink. The booze is cheap and they have pretty good selection, the company is fun what more do you want? Get over there and get to drinking."}
{"text":"Common Market is one of the best hangouts in Charlotte. It has an amazing beer and wine selection and everyone is extremely friendly. Tends to get a little crowded but even with a full house this place is great to hang out in. Bring your dog, grab a beer and join in on a very cool crowd."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite new places in Charlotte. 

The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, the clientele is hipster/casual mixed, the beer selection is phenomenal, the food from the deli is great and sometimes they have some great live music as well. 

It can get crowded later at night especially on weekends so plan on stopping by a little earlier. The patio outside is also dog friendly."}
{"text":"Not being a native of Charlotte I was kind of perplexed when my friend asked if I wanted to go to Common Market at around 10pm for a Friday night out. I suppose I was thinking what's so fun about going to a grocery/deli at night? Well I was in for a surprise when I got there. The place is packed and parking was almost impossible, and it didn't help that people parked extremely close to me after I arrived making backing out of my parking spot a very tedious job.

Once inside you're greeted by music, friendly people and a huge selection of drinks. They have tons of beers here and it seems like a great hang out spot. However I'm allergic to beer so it wasn't really an option for me and since they don't really have much else to offer in the evenings I felt a bit out of place when I was pretty much the only person who didn't buy a beer.

The location is great during cool/warm weather since it is close to a lot of other attractions of the Plaza Midwood area though. A variety of bars such as Snug Harbor, and Petra's along with restaurants such as the Diamond are in walking distance of where you park!

Not really my type of scene but the sandwiches sound extremely delicious here so I'll have to stop by for lunch to try them out sometime."}
{"text":"first of all, i'm pretty sure the chicken salad sandwich that i ordered was a tuna sandwich.  it was mushy with dill.  it was ok for a tuna sandwich, nothing to rave about.

but that's fine because the snack selection here is AMAZEBALLS.

all the kettle chip flavors you've ever dreamed of. and three different kinds of bugel flavors.  that's right, THREE FLAVORS including nacho cheese.

lots of good drinks made with cane sugar too. 

me likey."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the owner is a fan of bicycling, but a lot of bikers(human powered) like to hang out here. I often make the trek around town and made the common market my pitstop for a can of santa cruz lemondae. 
I haven't tried the deli, but there is a small farmers market on tuesday from 4-6 and saturdays 10-12 outside of the common market under a few shady oaks.  people sell vegetables, hand-made soap and candles, fresh herbs, and jewelry. be sure to check it out on your bike or even your car."}
{"text":"The Common Market is the best place to go for single good beers- they even let you drink them in the store or on their patio.  Besides having a huge selection of beer and wine, they also have a deli during the day-time that makes great sandwiches, etc.  I also love to browse the candy and assorted treats that the Common Market offers.  This place functions as a convenience store and a deli, but at night it also becomes a hang out for hip locals who wants to relax on the patio and drink and smoke cigarettes.  Open until 2 am!!"}
{"text":"If you are a vegan or vegetarian staying in the area, here's your spot! The market has a great selection of prepackaged foods, fresh out of the kitchen options and coffee. We ordered two vegan breakfast bagels packed with soy sausage, avocado, spinach, tomato and tofutti cream cheese. It's so refreshing to find a breakfast option that doesn't involve hummus . The coffee is also tasty, and don't forget to pick up a package of the No Evil Foods meat-alternative sausages (The Stallion) - so delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot featuring lots of unique items!  Small batch beers and wines both local and from other places.  Gluten free and not gluten free goodies, Archie MacPhee treats (like the Pocket Mr. T ), and even a deli counter.  I'm sure there was other stuff, I was having fun trying to see everything.  I was asked if I needed help and then left alone to browse (this is a good thing).  It's not a stuffy or upscale place, just unique friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love.  This is a grocery/deli/bar/concert venue/hipster watering hole.  They have cheap beer and wine, crazy decor, best beef jerky in the WORLD ( no exaggeration ), and always a fun performace or activity on the calendar from music, to art, to comedy, to a talent show where the host played a nose flute to ELO. Yup.  I saw it happen."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the positive vibe, fresh food and broad selection of draft beer on tap.  The dog-friendly \"secret\" beer garden in the back was pipin' good tunes and filled with such a pleasant clientele that we couldn't help but walk out with smiles and feeling refreshed! Reminds me of other favorite locations in Crested Butte, Santa Cruz, the Oregon coast or Charleston.  Organic, relaxed, eureka are words that come to mind. Draft beer options are rotated regularly or buy a 4 pack out of the cooler if that's where you see your favorite.  Dog entrance to outside tables is around back - not thru indoor market.  The impromptu singer phone reception we got when calling ahead was also appealing."}
{"text":"Came here for a beer and a sandwich for the rating was quite high. 
Ordered an ESB for beer time was nigh. 

Olympian wrap was filling and decent.
The beer selection was fresh and tapped most recent. 

Indie rock  and great atmosphere.
Glue my ass on the barstool I would pleasantly adhere. 

Come for the noon I highly support.
A five star review you will surely report.

End rhyming couplet review..."}
{"text":"There's nothing like being told that a certain store in Charlotte not only has the beer that you've been searching a month for, but also that it has a great selection of beer overall. Erin at The Art of Massage recommended The Common Market as a store that had the elusive watermelon flavored beer that I'd been searching for.

Finding the store was a bit difficult but the easiest way to find it is if you know where Phat Burrito is... The large parking lot across the street from it buts up to The Common Market's parking lot.

It looked like the world was going to end this afternoon as I parked the car & went inside. Immediately I saw beer. Bottles, cans, six packs... A lot of the brands I'd never heard of & I began to feel the beer sucking me deeper into the store. Fortunately I found the beer I was looking for in a refrigerated cooler. I bought 4 six packs & ran to the car. It looked like they had a little restaurant inside. Hopefully I can come back & check it out."}
{"text":"After finally going to The Common Market on Tryon, i suddenly hate myself and my life for not going sooner. If i were to dream of a perfect haven of beer and vegan options, it might be similar to what already exists here. 

If i were to take off a star, it would be for the reason i don't like not knowing what's going on. Place my order, now what? Will i hear my number called out somewhere? Can i grab any beer i want in the fridge? Is there an upcharge for drinking it there?  Luckily, the dude i asked was cool and i didn't feel like a d-bag for too long. In my dream, it might have a larger space and comfier seating.

Additional awesomeness includes the fact that you can just get the beer from the fridge and they'll open it and provide a glass with no additional charge. The price of drinking at home, away from home. Also, an outdoor patio. 

Thai curried shitake and vegetable soup was wonderful and a large was like $3.29 ish. Don't pass it up if you like Thai flavor with a tad of spice. Also ordered the MidEastern Wrap, not too shabby, i actually liked putting a little of the soup on it, but in hindsight would have added some hot sauce i didn't know was available. Next time we will pass on the potstickers, but we did enjoy the vegan cupcake...actually i really only enjoyed the frosting and could have done without the rest of the cupcake. 
Aside from the lovely beer selection, they have several vegan goods that we usually buy elsewhere (Primal Strips, vegan cookies).
Also of note, there is a coupon in the Entertainment Book for a free menu item with the purchase of a menu item, which i forgot to use. 

If we don't go back within the next month, something went wrong."}
{"text":"Ok so on our night out and if we are planning to chill in the Plaza-Midwood area this is either I first stop or our last or sometime both. I just love the vibe here. It is so chill and relaxed and that pretty much what you want when go out. Somewhere that staff is cool, great music, pretty much whatever you want to drink. I love that DJ play great music and it not just hip hop but its a everything from soul to funk. If you want to just chill come here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. EXCELLENT selection of craft beer, wine and interesting international food/candy. 

They also have a small deli where they make simple, delicious sandwiches for a very reasonable price. 

I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a cool, eclectic place to grab a drink or sand which."}
{"text":"I love the Common Market. This is my \"go to\" place in my hood for random gifts of the alcoholic kind and a great meeting place for friends. During Food Truck Friday, I highly suggest grabbing your food and then hanging to CM, where you can find seating and beverages on tap and in the bottle. 
Like an NYC Bodega, they offer random treats such as King of Pops popsicles, Vegan Cookies, and have a full deli in the back. Sometimes I wake up craving the deli's tuna salad. I'm not kidding...it's delicious.
The bartenders are always friendly and passionate to talk beer with you. They offer a large array of bottle beers, and seasonal taps. It's a great place to people watch and grab a quick bite. You can bring your dog too, which is always a plus!

The only reason I didn't give the CM 5 stars is due to 1. lack of seating (when it get's busy, it's packed, and seating is a rare commodity) and 2. It is HOT inside in the summer. I feel for the cashiers and bartenders, as I lasted maybe 10 minutes inside and felt like my face had melted off.

Otherwise, check out the Southend or Plaza Midwood locations. They're awesome and both bring a neighborhoodly flavor to the place."}
{"text":"Reminds me of a place I'd find in Venice Beach, CA.  This is great little joint.  Sunday brunch, evening beers, you name it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. What I ended up was only liking it....and it wasn't because of the food. Standing at the deli area, I saw the selection of chips and it was on point; there was a rack on the side just for cape cod chips, and a spot in front of the counter for the ever elusive flaming hot funyons. The staff was very warm and friendly and the building itself had a great vibe. The outdoor area was perfect. 

I really love chicken salad sandwiches and I'm not even that picky with what type of chicken salad it is as long as it's good. My sandwich ended up being bland, with more mayonnaise-ish flavor than I'd like. The bread for my sandwich and my girlfriend's sandwich was dry. We chose two different types of bread, so I couldn't even chalk it up to an errant loaf. Worst part was that I got the chicken sandwich deluxe, so I don't even know how a sandwich with bacon in it can be bland--but it was. I did like the place itself enough to want to come back and try a hot sandwich, but that would be it. It is pretty cheap, though."}
{"text":"This review is for the Common Market in Southend.  #1 reason for loving this place - they are pet friendly!  My two little ones had a ball while a friend and I sipped on some budget friendly wine.  They even keep dog treats behind the counter and an employee went out of his way to get a bowl of water after the pups tired themselves out!  

The atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming.  The clientele is a mix of young and old and everyone is super friendly!  You actually kind of have to be if you are sitting inside...the tables are very close together :)  

Common Market offers a nice selection of wines and beer.  I usually spend $12-15 on a bottle of red.  They also have a unique selection of homemade food and sweets.  I had a chocolate chip/coconut brownie \"thing\" that was just amazing.  They also sell a bunch of vegan and vegetarian foods, in addition to the regular deli style sandwiches that are available.

I'm a fan! Me and the kids (i.e. my doggies) will be heading back.  Dogs deserve a Friday night out too once in a while!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a for a sandwich and a beer not knowing what to expect. We both got sandwiches and they were great. We loved the selections and stuff for sale. The local beer was great too. I wish we had something like this in Wilmington. I would definitely recommend stopping in, even just to look around if you're not hungry."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was verbally and physically assaulted by a bouncer who works there.  They lost the business of me and all my friends....the place hires thugs to harass people!"}
{"text":"The Common Market has two locations: This one in Plaza Midwood and one in Dilworth. They both have a very similar vibe and about the same options. The basics: they have a huge craft beer selection, they have beer on tap, you can drink here, they have awesome deli style sandwiches, the atmosphere is uber hipster. 

I came into this location on a rainy day and parked over by Whiskey Warehouse. I came up through the back patio area and tried to order food at the bar. This is a little confusing, but you have to go around to the front, where the deli is, to order food. I asked for some recommendations and the girl at the deli suggested the \"Old Scratch\" on sourdough. The food came out fast and was affordable. I then grabbed a drink on tap at the bar and made my way out to the covered patio in the back. 

The sandwich was awesome! They use fresh bread daily made by Golden Grains and this shows. The bread is so fresh and delicious. I'm not even a huge carb guy, but I would just eat a loaf of that sour dough. They also use all Boar's Head meats and cheeses. They have a ton of options as far as sandwiches go. 

The outdoor patio, where I sat is a nice change of scenery and it is covered, so you can sit out there when it is raining. They also have seating inside and bar seating as well. This place is just the definition of hipster. I'm not saying that as a bad thing, but it's just the truth. It is so eclectic and just kind of off the wall. 

The Common Market is a quick place to grab lunch or a drink. You will be in and out in no time, or you could sit and stay awhile. There are plenty of beers to keep you busy. I will definitely go back to try some more of that awesome bread!"}
{"text":"Had the day off so I was biking around Plaza Midwood. Stopped by Book Buyers first (also a 5-star review) so get some great, cheap reading material, then had to figure out a lunch plan. 

I did my best Lance Armstrong impression (sans PEDs) over the the Common Market. I've come through here a few times to grab a beverage and once got a sandwich (but that was after a few beverages so I didn't appreciate it) so I decided to hit up the deli counter again. I got the \"Just Back From Brazil\", which was one of their daily specials. I'm very much a carnivore, but when I chose the Brazil the ingredients looked so good I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE IT DIDN'T HAVE MEAT! WHAT?!? Avocado, hummus, lettuce, a mango-sriracha sauce, red cabbage, green bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers, and sprouts in a lettuce wrap. **sigh**

Someone once described the Common Market atmosphere to me as \"steampunk\". Wouldn't fully agree with that, but it definitely has a different vibe. I showed up one afternoon straight from work (for corporate America) and caught more than enough stink-eye to last me for the week while wearing my shirt and tie. Who cares though?! It's an awesome place with all sorts of different people. Can't fault anyone for being themselves! I'd take all the stink-eye you can throw for some of their $3 pints on Thursdays."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, but I'm a bigger fan of their beer selection. They often have nights where they hire a DJ and you just buy whatever beer you want and hang out. It might sound weird to hang out in a store, but it's really cool... trust me! (If you get the munchies, Common Market has you covered!)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere where everyone is welcome. Trinkets are a plus too. Always a fun time"}
{"text":"I used to love going up here, now it has turned into a hipster hangout.  If that is your thing then you will love it.  If not then steer clear, afternoons are cool but the evenings and nights (Fri and Sat) tend to be DJ oriented to the point where it is hard to talk to people.  Good beer selection and food!"}
{"text":"Five stars simply because there are so few cool places in CLT! Nice little market where you can get knick knacks, some food, some drink. Little outdoor are between two buildings has a cozy, alley feel. You can crack open that beer out there, too. The writing all over the wall is kind of lame, but hey, these Charlotteans need all the outlets they can get in this buttoned up southern banking town."}
{"text":"My first time here, I saw that it was a very homey feeling. Every inch of space in the store was used and did not waste any. An awesome selection of beer that you can't find anywhere else, that was the first place I browsed. I drank the Aventinus which was absolutely delicious (and at 8.2% alc. content it got me where I wanted to be.) The only small problem I feel was that the seating was limited and parking was also limited. I think this only applies to the wintertime because it's too cold to go outside to drink.

I have heard raving reviews and talk about their deli, but sadly when I went there it was closed and I didn't get the chance to go and try their food. They definitely have an amazing amount of beer food where it accompanies your drink. I found that really useful as my friends and I did buy some snacks to eat. I will definitely be back here for their free beer sampling."}
{"text":"The Common Market has a very chill and relaxed atmosphere and the beer selection is always great. Probably the best hangout spot in the city. I love going here whether it's to grab drinks before/after FTF or meet up with friends after a long day. Staff is great and the patio area is where it's at...always good vibes here."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I'm vegetarian and I always try eat as clean as possible, so every time I want to eat something fast, tasty and healthy I go to eat there. Beside that, they have all kind of beers, wines and other beverages you can imagine. The area inside and outside are pretty cool and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice patio to relax and eat. Also pet friendly which is a plus"}
{"text":"A definite five-star experience.  You can get a unique, and ever changing list of, draft beer from the bar, or just pick one from their extensive selection in their cooler and have the cashier crack it for you.  

Lots of cool options, and a deli where I first came to like spicy mustard (after 28yrs) because they have the fantastic Boars Head w/ White Wine product in packets.

It can't really get much better for a place that is technically a convenience store (on steroids)

The workers have been much friendlier in recent visits since the time that I originally reviewed the CM."}
{"text":"Wow, this bar...errr... convenience store is popping on Friday nights.  I just stopped by for a quick break on a bike ride so I didn't get to thoroughly assess this location.   It has a really cool courtyard that is a great place to hang out in the evening.  I'll have to update my review when I get to see more."}
{"text":"There's no place in Charlotte like common market. Even the south end location isn't quite as awesome. I couldn't imagine the midhood without it."}
{"text":"The Common Market is SO COOL!!! Honestly, it was such a cool spot I found myself sitting there wondering if I was cool enough to be in there. I imagine the average Common Market customer to be a colorfully tattooed musician wearing sneakers custom designed by their equally cool artist significant other. In other words, this place seems like the perfect haven for creative, free-spirited Charlotteans who appreciate kombucha, beer and free love.

If a dive bar, a delicatessen, a New York-style upscale boutique grocery, and a punk rock music venue had a baby, they would name it The Common Market. There are lots of random things for sale on its shelves, like flotation devices, board games, and obscure candy. There is a little bar in the back, offering draft beer, draft kombucha, and $5 mimosas (at least when I was there on Saturday morning!). You can order food to pick-up at the courter to-go, or eat it on a stool or in one of their two quirky booths. I have only been for breakfast and unfortunately, have not had the best experience with food. I had soysage which was completely inedible (but props for offering vegan options!). I have had several people say that dinner is exceptional.

People watching is the best part of hanging out at The Common Market, and there is always someone interesting with whom to have a chat. It's so thrilling to experience some true local flavor in Charlotte--and there is live music at The Common Market almost every night! Drop by sometime and make The Common Market one of your CLT hangouts; I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great deli and great bottled and draft beer selection!  Awesome to hang outside on the patio on food truck Friday!"}
{"text":"M wife, my daughter and I went here a couple of weeks ago after reading about it online in \"the Charlotte agenda\". What a surpise....haven't been in the central area in a while...so it felt like a hidden gem..I ordered a tuna sandwich and had a beer while we waited. The beer & wine selection is wonderful...it ties in very well with the bar...Most places put mayo in their tuna...this place did not, and it was the best tuna sandwich I have ever had. Keep up the good work guys! I'm going back when the first opportunity presents itself! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting little convenience store that offered an interesting menu of sandwiches to eat there or take out. They had an extensive selection of interesting craft beers and some wine. They also had a small bar with a selection of draft beers. The bar was also a juice bar. They were a few tables that were mostly in use. Customers place and pick orders at a window. The store appeared to be a popular local attraction."}
{"text":"I had been in once to grab a cup of coffee, but I didn't have enough time to explore. We went back Labor Day weekend for a beer, and it was even more funky and fun than I remembered. There's a deli with sandwiches, a bar with some fairly rare beers, a few tables where you can sit and have coffee or a beer (from some good bottles they have on hand) and even some convenience store fare! There's also an outdoor area with umbrella tables, and on the day we went, there was a fella with a guitar playing music. There's something for everyone here!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Noda (the Art District) or the entire city for that matter to get a great sandwich and drink! 

It is a sandwich shop and drink/ snack market all in one. They have a great selection of beer and wine that you can either enjoy in their small, eclectic table area or take home. 

Their specialty however is the amazing sandwiches of unique combinations and of substantial size. All the ingredients tasked fresh and they use Boars Head meat! Amazing! Another positive is that you can get a sandwich and a beer without much of a dent in the wallet!"}
{"text":"I had read so many good things about Common Market that when I started a new job in Southend I made it a point to stop by at lunch for a sandwich to take back to my desk.. Asked a very friendly customer and was told about the back-to-front-to-back routine Ordered a Darby roast beef something or other on sourdough bread. Twenty five minutes later I had my sandwich. It had a good helping of roast beef, but the taste was nothing special. If I go again I'll call in my order and ask for horseradish on my roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"It's hard to find what else to say about this place, since so much has already been said. So, I will be brief.

This is a neighborhood staple. Everyone comes here: young, old, rich, poor, every race, ethnicity, you name it. They make great sandwiches and have classic snacks and a massive beer, wine and cider selection. 

They've recently expanded the interior to include a real bar with beers on tap and booths inside, which adds to the two already awesome outdoor areas (one which is like an alleyway and the other which is the front patio). It's a great way to eat lunch and hang out all day, drinking retail price beverages with a casual deli restaurant type atmosphere. 

Also, they have the good chips. Like, the really good chips that will make you break any diet plan you're on, especially after a few mimosas (which they sell all the ingredients for) and a really good made-to-order sandwich from their deli."}
{"text":"It's neither common, nor is it really a \"market,\" since you can sip, nosh, and sometimes listen there. I just love this place. It's one of the reasons I chose to locate so close by. From its sandwich delights, to its yummy handmade desserts, to its awesome well-priced selection of beer and wine, this place has got it covered. And where else can you find so many groovy kitschy bumper-stickers, buttons, and toys (a la Archie MePhee)? Years ago, even my eighty-something grandmother accompanied me here, and she loved it, too! The Common Market has captured an uncommon niche. It's a place where even weird folks are just folks."}
{"text":"This neighborhood hangout//convenience store offers a deli and Swig, a bar that now has a couple beers on tap. 

They have free wine tastings and a DJ every Thursday night. The place is usually packed, but it's a fun way to spend your evening 

You can grab a six-pack of an obscure brew and drink it right there at one of the tables inside or on the (somewhat hidden) patio outside. On a nice day, the patio is a great place to sit and relax. But after a rainstorm, it can be pretty gross out there. 

Common Market has a great selection of wine and beer, but it's often pricier than the Harris Teeter. For example, a bottle of Riesling might go for $10 there while it's $7 at the Teeter. But Common Market is open well past 10, when the Teeter and other shops close, so it's your best bet for late-night beer/wine runs."}
{"text":"Probably the most overrated \"Deli\" In town. First, when you walk in it instantly smells like unemployment. That could be due to the odd group of both hipsters and homeless people who hang out and smoke hand rolled cigs in the parking lot, but that kinda gives the place a little character. Then, you walk into a seedy corner store setup that you feel like you may get a bag herion with your food if you order the wrong thing off the menu. That aside the food is just kinda average but I think they're going for that. Again, probably not the worst out there but really overrated and I prefer to spend my money at places that value customer service. The staff is just kind of rude but I was wearing my CC hat and that may have triggered them."}
{"text":"Fantastic and stupidly fresh deli sandwhiches
Huge selection of sides
Huge selection of beers (including drafts) and non-alcoholic beverages
Friendly service
Comfortable atmosphere 
Community gatherings 
Nice patio 
Nice prices
Hipsters EVERWHERE!

What's not to like? The place makes me feel like I am hanging out at a friend's house who happens to have the most stacked refrigerator ever. Ride a bike for added cred."}
{"text":"Good spot to hang out and pre game. They have a wide range of brew and wine. Fun little knick knacks all around. Sandwiches are pretty tasty as well!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It seriously has everything, great beer, awesome deli, ridiculous things to buy, and fantastic live shows. How can this all exist in one place? I was only in Charlotte for a week, so I can't say I'm a pro on this city by any means, but Common Market was by far my favorite place. It was just dripping with energy and people that care about things that taste and sound great."}
{"text":"Really neat place!  Great food in the deli, lots of home made treats.  Really good beer selection.  And all the neat knick-knacks.  Great place to stop by, explore, and stay for a brew or two!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in town where all types of locals gather to drink and hang out. A must visit if you like unique eccentric environments. The first time walking in is a little confusing if you don't know what you're getting into. Convenient store meets bottle store meets draughts meets gag gift shop but with picnic tables. You can find it all! I don't care much for wine but as a beer snob I can say their craft selection is phenomenal! They also have cheap beer hidden away somewhere. The staff is always a good time and willing to talk to you as much as you are to them. I moved away from Charlotte and to this day can't find a bar with a better environment. I adore this place!"}
{"text":"Echo many others here; cool, relaxed, eclectic deli and grocery. One of my favorite Saturday lunch spots. 

The patio is great, it feels like a cozy hangout in your own backyard. Grab a beer or soda, a pasta salad, and a sandwich. Then head outside and people watch. 

For how simple a BLT is, it is difficult to make a memorable one, but CM does it. Try the BLT deluxe for a bit more substance. 

The main attraction for me is the wide selection of specialty and hard-to-find sodas. I will gladly splurge for soda that I can't find elsewhere. CM has a great selection of Italian sodas, puréed fruit sodas, ginger beer, Dr. Browns, Boylans, Virgil's, and plenty more left for me to try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and feel truly lucky to have it only about a block walk from my house. This place is the neighborhood go to for brunch lunch a last minute stop in for beer wine and even some grocery items as well. They have a great menu mostly sandwiches and small side items, but they have a whole vegetarian/vegan portion of their menu and its all tasty too! when you walk in you can go to the back to place your order then while you wait for your sandwich to be made you can browse the store for your side item from the fresh coolers while sipping your beer from the tap or a glass of wine while also grabbing a few random items you may be needing for your home like milk or toothpaste. 

This place is like your favorite sandwich shop, gas station and dive bar all rolled into one. They have a large outdoor courtyard that gives you an entrance and exit for the other side of the building and road so you can walk in from either side of the building. There's lots of tables outside for eating or drinking on a nice day.  Also during the summertime they have watermelon mimosas.... I repeat fresh squeezed watermelon juice meets champagne and magic happens. If you haven't made it into this place I'm not sure what your doing with your life. definitely check it out when you can."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!

I often host out-of-towners and I ALWAYS take them to Common Market SouthEnd! What's not to love? Delicious sandwiches (my personal favorite is the Special K wrap), an excellent beer and wine selection, some of the most wonderful employees you'll ever have the pleasure of interacting with, and a wonderfully casual, fun, eclectic vibe.

No matter what the occasion or time of day, this is my favorite place to spend time in Charlotte. I have yet to find a place like CM (besides its sister location in Plaza Midwood) in the Queen City.

Why are you still reading!? Go! Go there now!! (:"}
{"text":"Now stop, Dont get flustered, I only gave it a 3 right now because I am hoping to go back down and sample the Faire and environment, and upgrade this to a much more favoriable rating.

So yes I will be back, did not seem as fun as some other Farmers Markets I have been too. (Riverside Arts Market \"R.A.M.\" in Jacksonville Florida) but I can not wait to try out the food which looked eclectic and delicious.

If you want to comment on what is good, I will try it when I head back down in the near future!"}
{"text":"Too bad so many pretentious hipsters raid this place every night or I'd give it more stars. Frankly I hate even coming in because of the crowd that's always there. Sometimes the folks behind the counters can be a little snooty, but for the most part it's a great place to chill and get a good drink. Love the beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"Common Market is a great little place in the heart of everything. Great beer and wine selection with live music.  I love the atmosphere and we frequent this place quite often!"}
{"text":"This place is very Plaza Midwood hipster....appropriate for the digs of the neighborhood.  I'm far from hipster but have no problem fitting in to grab something.

I went on a Saturday night with a group of friends after dinner for some drinks.  I agree with everyone regarding the selection.  Awesome!  Small bar serving wine by the glass, or you could just purchase the bottle!  It's a place where you can go to socialize and not break the bank.

There was live music this night in the alleyway/patio area.  The thing I did not like about Common Market was how tight it was.  You could hardly maneuver in and out of the building because of the crowd of people.  I felt very claustrophobic and like I was at a street festival, which is not a feeling I like.  There is also zero air circulation in this alley area so if you are not a smoker, I would not recommend.

I have heard that the food is great!  I live right down the street but haven't tried it yet.  Wanted to update this- I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon so I missed the deli service, but I did grab a premade tuna wrap and a huge vegan cupcake.  The tuna wrap was nothing out of the ordinary.  The cupcake was huge and the frosting was great.  I guess they are made at the South End location."}
{"text":"This place is great, not only is there a deli with great sandwiches (I had probably the best breakfast sandwich of my life) but there's also a huge beer selection.  The coffee is good too.  It has a fun, laid back hipster vibe going on."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and a lot good food in the cafe, with vegan options. Everything is very reasonably priced. I wouldn't recommend going later at night unless you love crowds and tight spaces. Sometimes it can be obnoxious."}
{"text":"Common market is the hippest place in Plaza Midwood in my opinon. They have delicious sandwiches, I've had about 10 different ones and they were all delicious! $3 draft Thursdays can get a bit rowdy, but you can't beat the selection and price!"}
{"text":"It's a little pricey in my opinion, but the Common Market is one of the greatest places to find some interesting vegetarian lunch foods in Charlotte. 

I enjoy their barbeque tofu, and they've got some fantastic sandwiches. The whole she-bang will usually run you around $7, which is expensive when you think you could get the same deal from Subway for significantly less...but you feel better in your soul when you eat local! 

Common Market is near Yoga One, which is where I get my downward dog on, so I find myself over there a lot. The staff is friendly, the wine and beer selection is top-knotch, and the food is good.

Another of my favorite parts of this shop is their little weird toy section. I have a stretchy, squishy, sticky red pig that I keep in my kitchen window that came from there, and also a set of unicorn action figures emblazoned with the Russian hammer and sickle vs. one with the US flag pattern. Where do they find this stuff?"}
{"text":"This place is like your favorite baja that you got at your first music festival way back when that seems a bit raggedy to others, but feels good and just makes you happy when you put it on.  Granted as a resident of MorComm I am biased as this place is near and dear to my heart but it is not to be missed if you are in the hood.  Way back in the day when Blake and Cress first realized the dream we jumped on board and have been enjoying the ride and the experience ever since!!!  Whether it's dropping in for morning coffee, breakfast/lunch/brunch from the deli or beers beers beers... this place has become the heart and soul of our neighborhood.  It embodies the best of what MorComm and Midwood have to offer... the crowd is the most eclectic thing you can imagine, from Izods and sperrys to skinny jeans, nose rings, full tattoo sleeves and mohawks you will see it all here.  People arrive by Range Rover, blown out Honda, Fixie bike, skateboard, or just cruise in on foot and fall in together and enjoy the scene.  The food is great... breakfast picks in our house are the \"later hater\" on everything bagel grill pressed and pimento cheese grits (yes you read that right), and lunch is a \"Jack Kennedy\" (egg salad and horseradish spread with bacon) on marble rye.  If you are into beer, then just go over and settle in and drink your way through the cooler... you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I visited CM for lunch this weekend.  I have only been to the one in Southend, so I was excited to try this one out.  Walking up, the crowd of people outside were definitely a little...different.  But, I got past that and went in to order a sandwich.  The spicy turkey sandwich, which was delicious.  It was also reasonably priced, which is always a added bonus.  I definitely recommend CM if you are looking for a tasty sandwich...and some good people watching."}
{"text":"This place is so rad. It's got a little bit of everything;  a bottle shop with a variety of beers from all over the country and abroad, wine, a deli, old school candies and treats like Moon pies,and a great collection of craft beer on draft. They even have a deli! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Love the Common Market and the new sitting area outside!!  Wide selection of beer - just head on in, grab a cold one and grab a seat!  

Great little deli attached to this one where you can get a nice sandwich.  Very fun items for sale and eclectic atmosphere.  

I love sitting in the back where you can have some quiet drinking time.  There are fun items for sale back there - nostalgic to the just silly!!!  Get a sixer to go and tell your friends - what a great spot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go after work. Food is awesome and atmosphere is relaxed, come as you are, be who you are. Great outdoor space if you can get a seat! Inside is just as fun. Great place for the Creative Class... have great vegan and gluten free options..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and really cool vibe. I've gone here for years, just wished I lived a little closer. Great outdoor space with plenty of tables to sit at.  You can find just about anything in this tiny market.  Food is excellent"}
{"text":"Pricey brews on tap but great selection, chill crowd who is friendly albeit hipster, great DJs bumping along, and great court yard.  Best place in South End to hang out on a warm evening."}
{"text":"Cool deli/grocery market. Didn't try the sandwiches, but the store side is great for gifts."}
{"text":"As calling it a super market would be an insult, the (nothing) Common (about it) Market is well deserved 5 stars. Indeed, I have nearly lost friendships for failing to introduce them to this place in a timely enough manner.

While I can certainly understand the complaints about seating (indeed seating is limited), I see CM as a market first and as an alcohol-imbibing location as secondary. Think of it this way: how many seats does Harris Teeter next door provide for patrons drink their purchases? Exactly. 

So despite any shortcomings, it is enough for me that one can drink a beer on tap or a glass of wine WHILE ordering a fantastic deli sandwich (they have a great deal for grilled cheese and soup) and getting a few snacks WHILE forging through what is probably the best wine and beer selection this side of town. Add fun wine flights and beer tastings alongside live music and you have a winning combination.

The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and can recommend some great finds or order discounted bulk of your favorite drinks. And in a final coup de gras, CM has some legit sake and plum wine (not the crap you usually find in restaurants) that was actually made in Japan. This makes me very happy."}
{"text":"This place rocks!

Went here with the boyfriend, we had no idea what it was like and were very pleasantly surprised! Order food in the sandwich shop, they'll deliver it to you if you go to the bar (they are in separate parts of the building). They have beers on tap or any and every beer out there (ice cold) to choose from in their beer coolers. You can open a beer and drink while you shop! :-)

They also have a nice wine selection, and the staff has rated some themselves (which I love!). They have old fashioned candy and food items, old timey sodas, etc. This place is my new favorite place and I will go back again and again!

They have an outdoor eating area, and pooches are welcome!

You MUST try their pimento cheese-they have won some serious awards with their recipe, which consists of at least 5 cheeses, made fresh daily! Their grilled pimento cheese sandwich with tomato is FANTASTIC!

This place gets an A+++++ :-)"}
{"text":"Love the deli and good selection of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.  Great wine specials and beer tastings on Wednesday.  The crowd was always more punk than I was, but no one seemed to care.  The sandwiches are so good, and you can grab one that is already made if you are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"I dig the Common Market. Why? Because you can come in looking however you want and pick up beer, a sandwich, weirdo flavored chips, condoms, pimento cheese - whatever. Such a cool spot to hang with the dog or friends while drinking local brew outside. The juice is super rad - do that for sure! Also every sandwich they make is like love between bread slices, and the soup is outstanding. I love coming back to the office with the combo to share with work pals. 

Open late, its a great place to start or end the night. That late night snack and on less beer before that Uber ride home - or a 6 pack pick up and sammie grab for the in house night cap and snack. I love the local vibe you get here. Random shopping sprees are the coolest here. I once left with a rubber chicken - don't ask and don't be jealous. It was a great night. Common Market = Charlotte must!"}
{"text":"Nothing common about this place.

Unless common is the equivalent of awesome sauce.

From Moon Pies to Boylans . From Wind up Lederhosen to Zappo's. Handmade Deli sandwiches to heavy duty coffee. How did they squeeze that much really well selected craft beer in those coolers? It boggles the mind. Basically, an amazing collection of gourmet goods (aka, things I like to eat) and kitsch, crammed into a mini market that oozes cool.

Just wait. It gets better, they have beer on tap. Thomas Creek IPA! Again, kudos to whom chooses the brews! Drink it inside or out on the enclosed patio.

Yeah, Common knows that he's the cool kid, but he doesn't rub it in your face. He just chats you up and hands you another beer."}
{"text":"An incredible selection of beer! Why spend $3-4 for a shitty Miller Light draft at the bars next door when there are plenty of great microbrews here for half the cost? And best of all, you can drink them in-store! Well, after paying, of course.

That said, despite this Mecca of delicious and unique beer at your disposal, your crowd will be mixed with hipsters drinking cheap PBR, because thats what hipsters do. ::shakes fist:: HIPSTERS!!!

But I digress.

There is also a really good Boars Head deli on the premises. May I recommend the spicy turkey with pepperjack cheese on sourdough bread? Yum.

Simply put, I love this place. 

And don't worry, I love you too, hipsters."}
{"text":"Super cool neighborhood hang out spot with a really great selection of beer, wine, and sake for on or off-premise consumption. The small deli has a really good selection of very reasonably priced meats and cheeses, and an extensive variety of vegetarian and vegan options. Seems to be pet-friendly, at least outside on the patio. Moderately priced, and for the super selection they have, it was definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is a daytime dive bar, gas station, TGIF on crack with Pabst signs and pinatas dangling from the ceiling.  The inside is stacked with snacks and coolers of any type of beer imaginable.  The beer selection is as affordable as a grocery store, with Kirin Ichiban 22ozs for only 2.50.  So, grab a beer and head outside to the back porch and paint on the benches or bring a laptop to write.  

It is a communal atmosphere with friendly guests who respect the joint.  It's easy to get lost in the view of urban decay with an Irish sized beer mug in hand, and the music is anything from Radiohead to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.  Drop on in and drop out!"}
{"text":"Last night I went to the Vinopoly at the Common Market! It was grand! 22 wines to taste on the patio. It was 5 dollars admission and you could use the 5 dollars off on a bottle of wine or any purchase ! All sorts of wine, Argentina, Italy, Spain, California . Also a spin the bottle game and ring toss for more off the wine. They also brought out a huge cheese tray and cracker tray. The wine reps were most informative and would answer any question you had about the wines. The wines were great I ended up buying two bottles of I Perazzi from La Mozza winery ( which happens to be owned by Mario Battali) It was a great hearty red with big bold chocolate and tobacco flavors..really heavy and rich! It was 17.99 a bottle and with the five dollar off coupon and also an extra 10 percent off from the \"Spin the Bottle game\" it was very reasonable. I would definitely go back for any wine tasting they have!!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about CM.  You got novelty items to look through, great beer and a deli that always looks fantastic even though I've literally never tried it.  This location with it's new outdoor patio out front really has a following it seems.  We stopped in just the other day on a weekday and the place was packed.

Be aware the parking out front is weird and you basically have to back into a parking spot.  Strange and awkward.  

I come here for the beer selection, that's the main reason.  They always have good taps on deck and the bottle selection is equally impressive."}
{"text":"Common Market is my go-to for breakfast takeout on Saturdays (or Sundays). But do call ahead or you'll stand in line for a while. Or, if you have time to wait, CM has some funky merchandise that can be fun to browse. Recommend the Later Hater for breakfast or the Turkey Capri for lunch. Great beer and wine selection too."}
{"text":"I've been here for pub crawls, but I've never dined here before-until the gracious Chuck bestowed upon my staff a gift certificate to try out the lunch menu.  WELL, we were in love!!!!  I ordered a reuben panini with chicken enchilada soup and IT was to-die-for.  My assistant ordered their pimento cheese panini and I had a bite based on the fact that she said it was the best sandwich she ever had and yes, I agreed with her....it was!  My other employee ordered just a standard grilled cheese sandwich and it was amazing, too!  A MUST TRY for a lunch place!!!  We are now excited to attend some of their beer and wine tastings after work!"}
{"text":"Always a great time at the common market. Amazing beer and wine selection. Maybe one day I will actually try the food."}
{"text":"When this first opened right around the corner from me, it took me longer than it should have to drop by. So when I finally did, it had a lot of hype to live up to. 

I have eaten here. I have drank here and purchased alcohol to go. I have attended events on the patio here. All were enjoyable. Actually, I'll even go above that for the beer and deli- both were excellent. 

But I mean... they close at 10 and... I thought the whole point of.... the other one is open until... anyway. The website says 12 every night but a friend and I were most definitely locked out at 10:02 one Thursday night. And I went to an advertised music event, made the mistake of showing up fashionably late at 9:30ish, and the music was done before my beer was. It kind of takes away the lure of going if you feel like you're rushed out by 10 like it's CVS.

Night owls need beer too! I would love this to be a place I frequent but my own patio is open all night."}
{"text":"not common at all!! It is awesome.  Great place for a sunday morning breakfast or a place to buy a six pack and drink a few on the patio after work."}
{"text":"Sammiches! Cerveza's!

Used to go to this joint every weekend when I lived in Charlotte. It's a great little store with TONS of import beers. Lots of homemade sandwiches and TREATS by the register!

Great little place that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! From the really cool vibe to the great sandwiches it just doesn't get any better.  Go with the Mediterranean Veggie wrap.  It is so Awesome!"}
{"text":"Just went today fir the first time. Great atmosphere, good food (blt) and great drink selection. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I totally get the appeal of this place. It feels like a neighborhood joint and is a great mix of deli, grocery store, and coffee shop. Its adorable inside and has lots of character. However, I have to say the fact that the servers make the sandwiches without gloves and handle the meat without gloves grosses me out. Maybe I'm a clean freak, but you should wear gloves when you're making sandwiches and handling meat and other ingredients. Sorry. Otherwise, the food is very good, and there's a great mix of snacks and desserts!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a food truck Friday and was very shocked on their selection of alcohol. Lots lots of sake that a larger market would not even have. Service was great here and the selections of beer was so many!"}
{"text":"Oh Common Market - How I love thee!  Every time I'm in need of a little pick me up I head over to the hustle and bustle that is the Common Market SouthEnd.  I love going there during the day-time when all the skater kids are in their drinking cokes out of glass bottles.  CM just drives a really eclectic group of locals into one place for yummy sandwiches, homemade treats and of course adult beverages.  It's a great place to hang out and kick it when you are just trying to catch up with friends, and actually hear what they're saying."}
{"text":"There is nothing quite like the Common Market Plaza Midwood. At all times, you will find a diverse crowd gathered around the picnic tables in front. Great people-watching locale! Inside you will find everything from deli sandwiches and craft beers to ice cream, greeting cards and \"interesting\" other things to purchase.
I can attest to the fact that you need to visit a time or two to \"get\" the vibe and what's available. My first review was not stellar but I think that was due more to my operator error! I'm a big fan now."}
{"text":"Common Market is a funky place to grab a snack and some drink to enjoy. An interesting scene to say the least, but the selection is awesome and the picnic area can be an easy place to catch up with friends and do some people watching. Definitely a place to check out, even just to have some quality people watching!"}
{"text":"Will be back!
Big sandwiches, great chip selection, and great  prices for what you get!"}
{"text":"Thomas and his gang over here ooze with everything that I love about Charlotte - friendly, down to earth, come as you area attitudes that make you feel good about whatever you are (crust punk? banker? dog lover? bible thumper?).

A great selection of cold beer, they've got 4 taps here and a great deli serving up some vegan/veggie/carnivore treats throughout the day and early evening. Everything's fresh which is nice compared to the other quick places in the area that seem to deep fry their best stuff (hushhhhpupppppieeeeesssss). Along with some novelty items, you can also pick up some standards incase HT across the street is closed. Be sure to check out their outdoor patio area, too! It gets crowded quick but on a nice evening it's the place to be, often times with live music!"}
{"text":"What is there not to love? You can be weird and no one cares. You can be plain ol' vanilla and still no one cares. You can be a 2nd runner up in a Barack Obama look a like contest and still ain't nobody gonna care what you do or who you is - this is a place to come as you are and enjoy!

The deli at this and the other location are top notch if you're craving a sandwich - my go to is the California with some delish Boar's Head spicy mustard on it. That's right, Boar's Head only, biotches - high quality up in this piece! For our vegan and vegetarian friends, don't cry no tofu tears because CM is known wide and far to have you covered from sammies to salads (pasta, greek, etc) and locally made sweets that make your animal loving heartstrings go ZING!

The newer of the 2 Common Markets here in town, this is my favorite spot to grab a beer with friends, hand down! It used to be soley based on the larger patio this location had, but even with it's new extended picnic table cement patio that the Plaza Midwood location is rocking, I still catch myself coming to South End to indulge in a brew or 2 from their great bottle selection and rotating taps.

See you then!"}
{"text":"Dog friendly, great sandwiches, lots of gluten free options, super fun!  They randomly have live music during the week and it's a fun, casual place to meet for a drink or food.  Plus their brunch is delicious- the fresh squeezed juices are a must."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to start to describe this place... Everyone I talked to said we had to go and check it out, especially if we liked beer and people watching. This place definitely fit the bill!

To begin, this place is a literal market. More of a bodega really. You walk in to a small snack shop. They have local cheeses and meats and jar items. And chips, and t-shirts, and cigarettes. If you turn right there is a deli in the next room. There's a cooler with premade sandwiches, salads, pastas, cheeses, etc. And they have vegetarian and vegan items aplenty in there. There is also a random vending machine for musicians with drum sticks and stringed instrument strings. 

If you continue straight when you walk in past the bathrooms on the left and the register on the right, you'll come to a small 6 stool bar on your left with 15-20 beer taps and a lot of wine options. They also had canned and bottled beer. In fact you can peruse the extensive beer section at the back of the store and drink it thee if you'd like! There's also a few tables and chairs to sit at, but not a whole lot. You can also drink out on their front patio, that has heaters when it's cold. 

This was just a very interesting place to spend an hour at on a Saturday night. But it was fun and the beer was delicious and the company friendly. I'd stop back in Everytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Awesome sandwiches, the finest selection of kind bars and great people watching."}
{"text":"Common Market is just one of the many reasons that we love living in Plaza Midwood!

Great variety of handmade, eclectic sandwiches, wine & beer, fun snacks, and a great place to hang out!  On nice days on the weekend, the patio is usually packed so snag a spot early.

My only complaint is the sandwich shop's odd hours--- I wish they were open all the time!!"}
{"text":"This continues to be the place in the Southend that is just perfect. 

Great beer selection, tastings, live music and the people watching on certain nights can be a real treat.....think Snug Harbor with more hipsters shopping next door at the American Apparel.

PBR......man, Todd is starting to get a following around this town......everyone WANTS his business!?!?! *grin*"}
{"text":"I want to love the Common Market SO much.  After all, it's a quirky little place, with a great selection of interesting beer, wine and grub.  

The things I love:  
1)  I love their selection of beer and wine.  I feel madly in love with a Belgian beer, and this is one of the few places in town I can buy it.  It helps that it is so close to where I live, too.

2)  I love that they have beer and wine tastings on occasion.  Nothing like trying new stuff!

3)  All the staff people working there are awesome and friendly.  They helped me find what I was looking for and even recommended some good beers to me.

What I don't love:

1) Their food is really bland.  I have tried two of their sandwiches and two of their soups.  Both times I was incredibly disappointed.  The soup tasted watered down and their sandwiches were flavorless and dry.  The first time we thought maybe it was just a bad day; after the second time, I think I just need to give up on their food.

2) The parking is not great.  Now that they have finished some of the construction on Commonwealth, you can actually use some of the street parking.  However, on a busy night, all these spots are taken and parking is still limited.

3) This place is always crowded.  The space is cramped in there, with really narrow aisles.  The crowds make it difficult to search through the shelves to find some great brews.  It also makes it difficult to order food when the space is small and crammed with people.  I am still never sure if I'm cutting in line in front of someone.

In sum, I love the staff and the great selection of beer and wine.  This is what will keep me coming back.  However, I think I'm going to pass on the food from now on.  Overall, I give it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts. You can hang out there in some small seating areas, and even order food. Worth it just to come in and look around even if you dont need anything!"}
{"text":"A Plaza Midwood staple. Great selection of beer and wine, they have a sandwich shop when you walk in to the left, and small bar near the back door and a front and back patio where you can drink and smoke if you want."}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy alternative for lunch  - I met up with a friend at Commons Market. It's a pretty interesting place  with lots of wine and beer, a deli in the back , toys and trinkets for sale and a patio on the side. I decided on the Turkey Capri - hold the onions, and some New Orleans kettle style voodoo chips.. not even going to lie I totally picked these chips up just b/c of the name and the design on the bag.  Lunch was great! I will be back to try more things and maybe reserve some time to kinda look around. There isn't a huge eating space, maybe 4 tables at the most but there is  patio on the side (too cold to venture out) , this place reminds me of my home town Asheville very hipster-ish."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Common Market and have been a regular here for quite a while. The location, selection, events and awesome times I've had here really make it deserve 5 stars... but on two separate occasions I have been there for lunch and had to suffer through one deli employee's cuss-word-filled rant about her personal life while I was waiting for my sandwich. 

So, in case you were wondering, the brunette that prepares sandwiches there hasn't been laid by her boyfriend recently, has a distaste for food safety standards and thinks all the guys she works with are \"fucking idiots\". 

One time she stormed out of the kitchen just screaming expletives as she walked through the whole store (which included small children).

I know it can get a little rowdy there in the evenings (especially during Food Truck Friday which is incredibly cool if you haven't been out there on a Friday yet)... but both of these unpleasant visits were the middle of the day, post-lunch rush and it was incredibly awkward for all the customers inside. I don't know how that chick hasn't been fired yet."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Popular place to pre-game before hitting up other Plaza Midwood favorites like Snug Harbor on Thursdays. The \"patio\" (kind of an alley) is pretty cramped when it's crowded, not as nice as spacious as the South End location. But great place to grab a beer, a snack and even a gag gift."}
{"text":"Common Market is where the hip young and old (mainly young) go to hang out. I went there with some friends for a wine tasting they had. It's always crowded, but the energy baits you into staying and you're always glad you did. There are some interesting people to see and meet, and that always makes for a lively conversation. 

The only thing I've ever had there is the wine, which was great though. If I based this on atmosphere alone, it's 10 out of 10. Add the location and patrons and you've got yourself a neat hangout spot."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love CM?  Hipsters meet socialites meet people who just wanna get out of the house.  This is the go-to place on South End.  Super causal, nice atmosphere, decent music--just go already."}
{"text":"There is nothing common about The Common Market, whose mascot appears to be a drawing of a little sandwich with arms and legs with the motto \"Uber Deli\"  - small red square stickers that can be had for free.  Located in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte, this was one of Charlotte's earliest neighborhoods, which dates back to 1903, when its first avenues were plotted.  Plaza Midwood, as the area is known, is now home to the hipster crowd, with several blocks of turn of the century buildings offering MidCentry Modern furnishings, clothing and other brick a brack. 

The Common Market offers many alternative lunching options from the usual fried choices of The South, including a vegan sandwiches, wraps and salad selections in the deli as well as colorfully named sandwiches that include meat such as the \"Simple Simon\", \"Billy Club\" and \"Evil Homer\". Alternatives to high fructose corn syrup laden soft drinks include brands made with - real sugar, a novelty in this day of cutting corners and expanding waistlines. 

The clientele, on my visit, ranged from the hipster tattooed crowd to  locals buying a sandwiches. The Common Market is a cool little store, any city would be lucky to have an outpost of this market."}
{"text":"The original Common Market in Plaza-Midwood is, simply put, a landmark location in my life. When I first moved to Charlotte, I didn't have a clue what to do or where to hang out. My first visit to Plaza-Midwood (on Record Store Day 2009) involved a trip to Lunchbox and then to the old Penguin. Afterwards, I didn't have a clue what to do and I stumbled across the street into the Common Market. I didn't have a clue what it was. It went something like this.

Wow, this is really interesting. A deli? Ice cream and snacks? Oh, sweet, there's a bunch of coolers in the back. Wait - craft beers? I had a place like this back at Virginia Tech. I'll grab something for home. He just asked me if I wanted it opened? Uhm... I don't get it. Hold on. Those guys are drinking. Now I'm drinking. So it's like a self-serve bar? There's food? Snacks? What's on this patio? Oh nice, more people. There's music here tonight? Sweet. If I had an assistant, I'd tell her to cancel all my appointments. I'm going to be here a while.

Simply put, Common Market is the hangout for all the crazy hipsters and young adults that are refusing to grow up and work in a cube. But the interesting thing is, just like the (old) Penguin, those people are here too - and we all just get along. I made my first friends in Charlotte here after nine fruitless months going to Meetup events and stumbling around at Evening Muse and other NoDa hangouts. Common Market was exactly what I was looking for - great people drinking great beer in a great place.

Since then, I've been to CM (probably) dozens or hundreds of times - it's not just a store or bar to visit, it's a central part of my routine. I have formed friendships with the staff there. Brad, especially; he's my beer guide and has taken the time to remember my name and what kind of stuff I like and he's shown me a few choice bottles that I wouldn't have looked at otherwise. CM's one of the reasons I moved to Plaza-Midwood. It's also one of the reasons I stayed when offered by my work to relocate to Phoenix. It's where I go when I don't know what else to do. It's where me and my friends have probably our best memories or started our most exciting nights.

Common Market is, simply, part of our lives."}
{"text":"The Common Market is a magnet for the more interesting, artistic sort of people in Charlotte. This location, nestled into Plaza Midwood, accentuates this fact with crazy things hanging on the wall, live music on occasion and a broad variety of beverages (ranging from off-brand cane sugar sodas like Boylan to PBR to tasty Belgians and beer snob can appreciate.

There isn't as much sitting room inside at this location as the Dilworth location, but its still a nice hangout."}
{"text":"This was one of the first places I visited after arriving in Charlotte from the northeast. I showed up later in the evening after deli hours so I can't recommend that, but as far as a hangout area where you can snag a drink or two, I definitely would recommend it. 

This place provides you with a very comfortable, hipster-esque environment and friendly staff. For the average beer snob, you'll be content with the selection- I snagged a dark Belgian ale and kicked back with a friend of mine and people watched for an hour or two. Aside from their alcoholic drink selection, they offer a lot of organic and healthy drinks like Reed's Ginger Brew and Kombucha.

The only set back I can think of is they close at 10pm on weekdays and midnight on the weekends.

if you're the type to kick back in skinny jeans, a vintage T shirt and drink PBR, you'll feel right at home."}
{"text":"Simply put, I am neither pierced, tattooed, nor hip enough to frequent this Common Market on a regular basis. Sure, I'll run in and out real fast to pick up some beers or lunch to go, with my head hung low so as not to attract attention. But, I never linger because I just can't handle the crowd that does hang out here. #iamold 

If you are slightly uncool and don't have a hip bone in your body like yours truly, might I suggest you check out the new Common Market Oakwold. Now, there is a place that I can (and do) hang out at multiple times per week!"}
{"text":"Love thus place! Great atmosphere. Love coming to the patio for drinks at night or for brunch on Sunday. Their fresh made OJ is the best!!"}
{"text":"Common Market is a pretty unique place to shop around for something to drink or snack on and then hang out. Wide selection of drinks, smaller selection of food. I've been told that the Southend location is the yuppie Common Market and the Plaza Midwood location is the grundgey one. Haven't been to the Plaza Midwood one yet, but will once the Southend one closes in a month."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the Common Market.  After having a wonderful filling meal at the  Diamond... we moseyed on over to the Common Market.  We actually had a mission to find a couple specific beers that we had sampled at the BBQ, Beer, and Bourbon Festival at Southpark the other weekend.

I was a Common Market Virgin up to this point, but as soon as you walk in the door, the place and ambiance gives you a huge hug of uniqueness - music is blaring, tons of selections of beer and wine,  people having good conversation, or just hanging out on their tiny, but awesome patio.

We definitely had fun looking for the beer... AND WE FOUND IT!  Well, just one of the two kinds we were pining for.  I ended up being intrigued by a bottle of wine (it's label and description drew me in)...  I know where to start stalking my wine collection from now!  Very excited and I know I will be back to enjoy the Common Market again."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful and quirky convenience store/deli in one of Charlotte's funkier neighborhoods.

It's funky because it's independently owned and not forced to conform to corporate standards.  Common Market has one of the best wine and beer selections around and if you're looking for something in particular or looking for a recommendation the staff is more than willing to help.

Occasionally they have wine and beer tastings.  I've seen concerts there and I've even had a birthday party on the patio.  The patio is cool as well - 4 tables nestled in a quiet space in the back.

I haven't eaten anything from the deli other than the hummus but I hear it is fantastic.

Kudos to the ownership and staff of Common Market for making something funky in the QC!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe but I don't understand the hype on the sandwiches. They're just glorified boars head deli sandwiches you could get at HT for $3 cheaper. 

Vibe is definitely cool and good selection of other snacks, drinks and food"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, delicious deli, enjoyable people watching- what more can someone want?"}
{"text":"The soul of plaza mid wood. Snacks, drinks, novelties. Punk rock atmosphere and great for a quick bite. This place is filled with character and history, a must go to if in the area.. Ask for bartender Matt- he'll cater to all your beer needs, accompanied by great conversation. On weekends they have love music. 

PS- vegetarian/vegan menu in their deli section!"}
{"text":"Common Market is a neighborhood general store and deli. Ive heard it described as the local country store where you can purchase a fried fish sandwich the likes of which you will never find again. 

In the case of Common Market, local seafood is repliced with a wide selection of New York Style Deli options. Unlike other local delis, Common infuses vegan, gluten free and organic options to the menu.

It gives you a small town feel in the midst of one of the fastest growing cities in the nation.
The old style fish and tackle store without the hooks and cane. The real deal in Charlotte.

People hold on to the establishment as a local icon. The Deli options are inventive and there is a wall of odities that would remind Xenials of Spencers, but kid friendly. The patio is dog friendly and parking continues to be accesable despite the unique location in the heart of Plaza Midwood. 

Roco used to be my favorite Columbian styled, purveyors of incredible Carribean sauces. It still is but Common Market has it all. Almond milk to vegan cookies form part of the multilayered inventory of this one of a kind, hybrid market deli. 

The staff is brilliant and always attentive. The enviorment is dynamic and diverse. Moreover,
the arts and local artist are supported by the neighborhood."}
{"text":"holy college crowd!  We were definitely the oldest people there, but we had such a blast!  This market is a blend of eclectic food & drink offerings that you can take out with you or eat/drink onsite.

We had looked for live music and found Remy St. Clair which sounded interesting so in we went.  The stage area is at the front of a long, narrow patio with some seating, but mostly standing room.  I sat on the end of the stage and didn't feel out of place at all (but that's just me).  Even though there were people smoking in the crowd, because there isn't a roof it wasn't bothersome.  The band played a fun and lively mix of everything including original material.  

We purchased a bottle of wine (or two?) and the bartender was happy to provide glasses for us.  We had some little nibbles that we purchased there and really had an amazing evening.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fun place with organic-ish / natural type food options (sandwiches etc.) They do a good breakfast / brunch although we were too late for that. 
Good coffees and wines to have while you hang out. The outside patio is eclectic with odd furniture and such. However one of the workers was smoking out there as well as a customer (who hadn't seemed to have purchased anything) so that get's a little old for the rest of us who are spending good money. But since it's a little different from the typical food joints, they're worth a revisit."}
{"text":"I find myself going to the Common Market at least 3 times a week.  For food from the deli, groceries, cold craft beer, or just to grab a table and get some work done. 

This place is so many things to the neighborhood.  It is in the perfect spot, right off a central Ave on a part of commonwealth that actually doesn't see insane traffic.  

The deli sandwiches are what made me fall in love with the Common Market.  All my other praises of the place may just be my food buzz that I get from the deli.  They have the best pimento cheese sandwich in the city.  All of their breads are fantastic and their veggies always taste very fresh.  Their breakfast is also out of this world.  Grab a bagel sandwich and a coffee and you have one killer breakfast for less than 7 bucks.

They are open until midnight in school nights, sell single cigarettes, have beer on tap and bottled in cooler displays, and the best deli food in the neighborhood.  What more could you ask for?

If you live, work, or play in Plaza Midwood, the common market is a requirement!"}
{"text":"If I could fall in love all over again it would be with The Common Market. I love the vibe, the food, wine and beer. It is laid back with great music and service. I stopped in for a simple salami sandwich on plain white bread for my finicky 9 year and fell in love. They guys that work there were helpful and had a sense of humor as I placed my ever so simplistic order. I look forward to coming back for a quick beer at their bar, shopping their great wine selection and grabbing a few vegan prepared foods to go."}
{"text":"this place was a total hit for me. my first time there a few days ago & i really like the chill, laid back atmosphere.  great selection on food, beer, wine & Kombucha :) this place is for everyone & anyone.  its family friendly, dog friendly & the staff is cool. I just wish their outside sitting in the back was a bit more open since this place gets packed up quickly.  if you're looking for a bite to eat, or a glass of wine or just to hang out with friends this is the place to be. check it out & enjoy."}
{"text":"There is something truly special about walking into a small little -stuffed to the brim with every goodie imaginable- convenient store/deli that makes me wiggle, dance, and smile like a little girl.. From the local goods, huge selection of beverages, down to the amazingly tasty, heart crafted sammich that literally had me dancing in my seat while I enjoyed each bite...Everything is amazing! Staff is really friendly and awesome!!! Seriously, check this place out! The Reuben is so dankk"}
{"text":"My go-to neighborhood hangout. Love it so much I almost don't want to advertise for them in case fratty douche bags show up. 
Sandwiches are excellent and there's a wide range of choices, but the beer and wine selection is where it's at! Buy a bottle at reasonable prices, then drink on the patio. Sunday brunch is also really good.
Free beer tastings the first Thursday of the month, wine tasting the first Wednesday of the month."}
{"text":"I love the vibe in this eclectic, crowded market. The patio is one of my favorite spots to grab a quick bite for lunch or an afternoon beer or glass of wine - it's especially great that it's dog-friendly! It's a great option for going out to meals with friends as a vegetarian, as conventional delis frequently lack for meatless options. They offer plenty of vegetarian offerings from the deli counter, all made to order and customizable; they also offer tons of yummy takeaway options."}
{"text":"This is a off the beaten path kind of place, but make no misteak about it they are legit. Let me start with the amazing soups i haven't had one yet that disappointed me. My daughter can't get enough of them and she isn't a soup person at all. The creamy shrimp chowder is simply amazing being I'm not a sea food lover so for me to say this goes against my taste buds.... Now on to the sandwiches; the variety is endless because you can build your own and the panini are insane. Any sandwich can be made hot. Again quality ingredients pushed them over the top. Atmosphere is a little on the Corky side, but don't be fooled or put off it's worth a try you won't regret it. The salads and freshly made spreads are worth trying as well"}
{"text":"What a great place! There are all sorts of goodies including beer/wine, prepared salads, soups, breakfast and lunch sandwiches and desserts and lots of specialty items including fresh pasta you could take home to cook for dinner. They also do Sunday brunch with a special menu. There are several tables for eating in and they do a large takeout business as well. Every week they have a wine tasting and a beer tasting and live music nights are not uncommon :)

After much deliberation I tried the Soup-O-Rama which includes grilled cheese made with your choice of cheeses and optional tomato and a large soup. The soup selections change frequently but were very impressive. I tried the red pepper gruyere (I think that was the name!) but they had so many tasty sounding options including Brunswick stew and chili. They always have at least one vegan or vegetarian soup. I also sprang for one of the giant chocolate sea salt cookies that are next to the register. Everything was delicious, especially that soup. I definitely look forward to trying more from Common Market soon. The original location is on Commonwealth Avenue in Plaza-Midwood."}
{"text":"What a fun and eclectic place. Good deli, seating outside, fantastic selection of bear, wine by the glass. A great place to relax."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, ok latkes, and surprisingly great coffee. When I wake up a little early, this is my first stop on the way to work."}
{"text":"I use to frequent the other location but after moving this is my new CM. A few things of note about this location:

Seating is horrible...They have room for more tables but for some reason they just don't put them in. If they changed things around they could make more bar seating or add more regular seating. That being said if you're cool with standing and/or leaning while drinking this shouldn't be an issue for you. Outdoor patio is a smoke-fest. If you don't smoke it is reeeeaaaalllly tough to enjoy sitting outside here. Everyone does it and they don't have enough space (very narrow patio) to do it in. 

Now on to the good stuff: Staff here is always super friendly! The food is great at this location although I've noticed they sometimes close the deli at odd hours during the weekend (11am one time on a Saturday??) 
The place itself never ceases to amaze me - bomb wine selection and fun conversation pieces everywhere.

Oh yea and drinks are cheap!"}
{"text":"This use to easily be a 5 star place for me - awesome location, great atmosphere, super drink selection (beer & wine), and something way different than your usual marketplaces. I spend a lot of time and money here since I live in the neighborhood. 

BUT...  I have had some major issues with customer service lately..why the heck are they hiring mean people?! 

When I made a comment about a product they were out of - the person at the counter literally shrugged...I mean really you cannot have an actual response? I wasn't making an off-putting comment - it was more disappointment than anything else. I noticed on another occasion a girl told her boyfriend \" wow that guy must not like me\" ...it was the same guy being rude to another customer. 

Then on a separate occasion I waited 20 minutes for a deli sandwich ...as I watched several people walk up and take their sandwiches home I finally had to ask where mine was. I was told \" some asshole took yours\"- and then he slammed my sandwich down on the counter in front of me. Well excuse me, last I saw you had to hand the sandwich to that \"asshole\" -so you actually just gave my sandwich to the wrong person. I was honestly stunned by the response. I would have been fine if they at least told me why I was waiting so long (before having to ask) or here is a novel idea offer an apology. 

I love the venue but with the attitude I've experienced lately - I will have to start looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Common Market is an excellent little deli, bar, and quick grocer in SouthEnd Charlotte.  

If you are looking to pick up a quick bottle of wine, a fresh sandwich, or just something basic, this is one of the best drop-ins in the SouthEnd area.  I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I always get anxiety when I first visit somewhere like Common Market.  Like everyone knows the system of where to order and where to pay and what to get and it's just very overwhelming. Needed some nourishment after a hot yoga class, so headed over to Common Market. I went with the Darby, which is roast beef with horseradish cream cheese, cucumbers, lettuce, tomato and onion. The horseradish cream cheese really made it. Would be great on a bagel. Other than that it was just a pretty typical roast beef sandwich. Took home a firehouse for my boyfriend. Was also just a pretty typical sandwich. They have beer on tap as well as a huge bottle selection and lots of other snack stuff and a deli case with salads and sides. I think its a great place to grab something quick if you are in the area."}
{"text":"If a convenience store could have a personality, it would be the Common Market. It would also be a hoarder of sorts. The main difference being that they do not mind getting rid of (selling, not giving away) their stuff - they just replace it with more when stock gets low. But like most hoarders - and like others have mentioned - the place is packed.

On the one hand, there is nothing quite like CM, and that includes the South End location. This spot has a shortage of parking, though you can make do if you try hard enough. The deli is up front rather than being tucked at the back, and finding a spot to mix and mingle can be a challenge at best. If you want to kick back and relax, South End may be better - it doesn't make this one bad, it just makes it different.

If you want to drop in and grab something, you may be fine, even if you do want to hang out for a bit. Just recognize that it is probably not the relaxing oasis of the other location."}
{"text":"Where to start?  The Southend version of the Common Market has many things to talk about, and I'm sure I'll miss something.

First, you have the market.  On that front, it's not bad.  I mean, it's a market.  They are a bit on the funky side, but generally they aren't much different than any other convenience store.

Next you have the \"deli\", where they serve up fare that is generally healthier than your usual fast food, and at a decent pace (unless they are busy, which can happen).  The only thing that is a bit bizarre here is you go to the back to order, then back to the front to pay, perhaps shopping while you make it there, then wander around while you wait, then pick up your food - and you don't typically have to show a receipt that you did pay.  You also have to guess as to when it's ready, because they don't let you know and they don't bring it out to you.  And there isn't a sign saying that you go through this process.  You're just supposed to know (or ask).  It's not bad, it's just awkward, and more so for first-timers.

Finally you have the patio, often adorned with lights of some kind, and usually featuring dogs, music and a variety of clientele.  It can actually be quite a nice place to enjoy your food and even an offering of the CM, such as a beer tasting.  The downside?  Even if there aren't many people there who are smoking, it smells like smoke.  If you smoke, it's not a big deal, but if you don't, it's a bit overwhelming.

As to the food?  It's decent.  Much of the packaged food, even the not-quite-what-you-would-find-elsewhere stuff, it's not generally outstanding, because it is packaged after all.  What you get from the deli is typically good, but it may not be worth the hassle of everything else.  Probably better than what you or I could make at home, but maybe not, as I have no idea who you are.  I only know my own limitations."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and decided to go one night with a friend. It's literally a market where you get what alcohol you want as well as snacks. There are a lot of options to choose from. Lots of beer choices! The snack choices are great especially if you are hungry. There aren't really a lot of places to sit in side but there is seating outside. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great spot to pick up a bottle of wine. Staff know their wine and always give great advice. They have never steered me wrong."}
{"text":"I came here to meet some friends for lunch while in Charlotte recently and was impressed.  They have a great selection of wine and beer (in single bottles as well as six-packs) and a deli with some fun sandwich/wrap combinations.  

Also, there's a fun outdoor space in the back that is perfect for a relaxing lunch or, even better, day drinking."}
{"text":"You can buy bottle of wine/champagne, canned or draft beers, a sandwich and listen to a cool ass female dj spin old school hip hop/ r&b music while chillin outside in the patio. This is my kind of place! What else can you ask for? Not too crowded, diverse crowd of people, and affordable drinks n food.

I've tried the pimento deluxe sandwich which came w slices of bacon and tomatoes! They have a great selection of beers on tap and best part is the patio and live dj (at least on weekends). And the service staff was chill/friendly, and very patient."}
{"text":"The Common Market is a great little spot to grab a decent sandwich and generally whatever your heart desires to go with it. They have sodas, beer, wine, and even mimosas (including watermelon and blueberry flavors) and different liquors at the small bar on the side. They also have ready made sides like mac & cheese, fruits, chickpea salads, etc. and different grocery items you could grab (chips, pop tarts, trail mix, even Quest bars which I love). 
The sandwiches are great. The quality Boars Head meats/cheeses and Golden Grains breads are top notch, and they seem to do a solid job of making sure they don't give you a sloppy/rushed creation or skimp on any of the toppings which is good. The workers seem really friendly, although very hipster to the point that it's kind of comical to me.
Overall, solid sandwiches at a decent price and a great selection of other things to go with the sandwiches plus a great atmosphere and seating."}
{"text":"A worthy update for the Common Market...new obsessions include:

-The J Wrap: a tasty breakfast wrap filled with eggs, cheese and black bean/corn mixture with bits of tomato and onion. Your choice of protein and carb...utter deliciousness. 

-7 Layer Bar: Mmmhmmm treats! Just get one.

-Scoop Salad: Just $5 for a scoop of chicken salad (my fave) atop of fresh greens and some decent dressing options. 

-Milk: They now carry a few half gallons of milk! 

Still the same friendly employees, awesome patio and surprisingly fresh and innovative beer specials. See ya soon, Common Market."}
{"text":"I'm a touch partial to the CM in South End, even though I know this is the original mamma jamma! 

Really, what's not to adore? A myriad of interesting bottled beer and wine, fresh pints off the tap, a great crowd and excellent live music. Plus, if you're feeling snacky, there's a plethora of choices - tasty sandwiches, chips, cupcakes, salads, soups, etc. There's a bite for everyone, regardless of your culinary curiosity. 

And yes, Common Market offers some of the best people watching around. It's a very delicious utopia, right in the heart of Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"My deli of choice for sandwiches. Also a great place to grab any kind of drink. Local beer, wine and fun sodas and juices."}
{"text":"The Common Market is cool without being pretentious about it. It's like that guy in high school who says, \"yes, I can pull off pink, and I dare anyone to say something about it\". The infusion of  listening to Frank Sinatra sing New York New York while gazing at an angry pumpkin next to a zombie donkey mask (I know I didn't think that sort of thing existed either) gave it that hip punk feel. Good local taps, and bottle selection. Sandwich was also tasty."}
{"text":"I live just down Commonwealth and absolutely going to Common Market to get one of there deli sandwiches!  The Californian is my favorite.  They have a great wine and beer selection as well and have wine tastings and other events throughout the week!  Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"This place is just pretty damn cool. Is that what the kids would say these days? A neighborhood hangout/convenience store with an eclectic twist.

The Common Market is one of those places where you can do a little bit of everything. Wanna grab lunch? Need good beer or wine? Looking for a place to have a meeting? A patio to enjoy a drink? Do work? Unique gifts? Yes, you can find all of it here.

Along with regular menu items, the deli cranks out different specials and homemade soups daily. I took their Dilworth Special to the tv station recently for a segment and everyone fought over it afterwards. Yeah, it's pretty tasty. I usually go with a spicy turkey sandwich and one of the soups. Soup not your thing? They have plenty of homemade sides, too.

The patio here is tremendous. Perfect spot for people watching and live music. 

The parking lot can be tricky. If it's a busy time (say lunch rush), you may have to drive around the block to wait for someone to leave and steal their spot. Keep an eye out for parking spots on the street."}
{"text":"The food here is underrated...standouts include the Ruben and the Pimento Deluxe. The beer selection is great as well."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. hands down. Really cool and nifty little place. The crowd is always fun to observe as well. So much beer to choose from that it actually hurts my brain. Prices are pretty steep on snacks and beer."}
{"text":"We visited The Common Market tonight in hopes of a new find on our  never ending quest for good vegan and vegetarian fare.  They did not disappoint!  The hubs got the Soy Boy on sourdough. It was a bit dry, but only because the sandwich didn't come with  sauce (as advertised).  Understandable.  I had the avocado barbecue wrap and it was wonderful.  I did have to return my sandwich  because tofu was left off, but the sandwich was remade with no issue and the cook was very apologetic. He added extra avocado to make up for the mistake.  The wrap had shredded beets, carrots, red onion, tomatoes, veganaise, avocado, tofu, cheddar, and I think that's it!  It was very tasty.  The market itself is a wonderful place to visit if you are in South Bend, and in search of beer or wine. There are also plenty of funky gifts and snacks to choose from.  Go there, check it out, and spend some time. The staff were all very pleasant and everybody had a smile. We had a great time. Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Always has a good selection of local beers on tap. There deli makes delicious sandwiches fresh and fast. They also have a wide variety of craft beer on sale. They make there own brand of coffee sold by the counter and also carry Zapps chips from Louisiana which are the best brand of kettle chips known to man"}
{"text":"Been in here a few times to grab a quick bite to eat, very good fresh sandwhichs and grinders.  The guys who work in the kitchen are very friendly and help you make the best food combinations with their suggestions.  Very casual attire.  Can bring dogs and have them hang out outside with you - they even have bowls for them to drink out of."}
{"text":"Came here after talking a walk in south end this afternoon.  Loved it! A girlfriend and I grabbed a few beers and sat outside to chat with others.  Had a sandwich here one time too - it was to die for."}
{"text":"I am from Europe and lived in Berlin the last two years before committing to Charlotte. This is like a \"Späti\". A place where one can buy beer or wine in a bottle open it and enjoy it there. The ambiance is easy and wild. Staff is friendly. This place is very artsy and fun. But the main thing is that you can get ANYTHING here! I only stopped here for lunch and then had a coffee. I ordered a veggie wrap and it was affordable and yummy. 

They have an outdoor area, where people read, drink coffee, eat lunch and smoke. What a fine place to have in my hood. I heard rumors that it will be closing soon, but a new location should be opening there as well? Well, please do so!! Because I found my new hangout."}
{"text":"Wow! Coolest beer shop I've been to in a long time! 
This place is amazing. They've got it all! 
The beer selection here is quite impressive. They specialize in hard to find beers, with a section for sour beers, IPAs, and seasonals. They have a small bar, where you can get a beer on tap, and drink it there, or out on their nice patio. 
They also sell wine! They've got a wine expert on site to help you with your selections. The staff is also quite knowledgeable about their beers as well. Since I was an out-of-towner, they were able to steer me to the best local beers, made just down the street. 
The store also sells weird knickknacks and strange toys, like pigeon masks, or red fuzzy fezes.  
The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant. They made the visit quite enjoyable. 
In the back, they have a deli with a wide variety of sandwiches, and a vending machine that sells musical accessories, like drum sticks and guitar strings. 
The place isn't exactly clean, but I get the feeling that they're going for a dive vibe, which is certainly working for this place. 
The patio is nice and large, with outdoor heaters and plenty of seating. They allow you to bring your beer purchased inside out onto the patio and drink it right there. This is something I'm not accustomed to, but I really enjoyed the experience! 
If you're looking for something good to drink, this is your place."}
{"text":"Where else can you find fridge magnet dress sets for President Obama AND Sarah Palin side by side? Who else offers beer, bitters and \"Before, During and After Sex\" breath mints. Where else can you order a microbrew under the watchful eye of Lando Calrissian? Need to pick up another pack of tree tea oil toothpicks or Jesus sticky notes. This is your place. It's the only convenience store/deli/wine bar/pub/coffee shop I've ever been in?  There is even an outdoor side area where I suspect smokers can enjoy a cigarette. These guys have raised eclectic funk to an art form. Check it out next time you hit Thomas Street Tavern or The World Famous Penguin and be reminded of how fun life can be.  The clientele is as eclectic as the merchandise with a smattering of housewives, punkers, Goths, gays and 20-somethings. It's so encouraging to see such funk and diversity alive and well in button-up CLT! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Don't get all freaked out like a whiny, petulant child if you see a Anti-Pat McCrory Deli Special. The owner of the Common Market has a heart as big as the beer selection. Many consider Him a local hero. Besides, is there anyone that actually takes Pat McCrory serious ? lol

One of my favorite places to visit. The Common Market has a great deli, and sandwiches, cold beer and good conversation. There are always friendly people out on the patio to talk to, and the politics, and conversation generally lean to the left. The Common Market is LBGT, and Liberal Friendly. As most people know, This Entire Area is LBGT , and Liberal Friendly. So don't visit and get Butt Hurt. I would highly recommend this place to ALL my friends, a Great place to hang out with a date, or friends, or someone looking for something a little different."}

Now on to the important things. Common Market is one of my favorite places to bring my Wife for an morning coffee, and bagel, or a sandwich, and beer for lunch. The Common Market has a great deli, and sandwiches, cold beer, fair prices, a nice staff and usually some good conversation. They also have some interesting gifts. WELL worth a visit. Visit it once, and you'll be a regular."}
{"text":"The Common Market is one of my favorite places in the South End area; maybe even in the entire Charlotte Area. The beer and wine selection is amazing and the environment is so laid back and relaxing. Its a great place to kick back and have a few beers with friends. Even their lunch sandwiches never disappoint. 

The thing I like the most about CM is that you can find a good variety of different people here, which in my opinion, you can't often find in Charlotte. They also have live music and a fun outdoor patio to relax in. 

To top it off, their coffee is really good to. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Common Market is a cool little spot in the Southend. It's a little cramped inside and not as spirited as the Plaza Midwood location, but it's still fun. The courtyard is a great place and a little unique gem."}
{"text":"Came here in search of vegan breakfast but worried it wouldn't deliver since most of the places I've been to lately have no handle on it whatsoever. 

Walked in and was greeted by good vibes and hipsters. Always a good sign for vegan!! 

Went straight to the ordering counter and ordered the vegan special which was soysage, daiya cheddar, veganaise, spinach, tomato and hashbrowns on a spinach wrap and drumroll.....VEGAN GRITS!

After I placed my order, I began perusing the shop while waiting for my order. I opted to pick up some lunch options from the cold case. I selected the garlic sesame noodles and vegan chicken salad.  Then I took a lap around the store side. Some great options including fresh coffee  and pastries. 

While perusing the drink cases I came across my favorite San Pelligrino pomegranate aranciata. SCORE!!!! 

Everything I purchased was just over $15!

When I got my order I ran to the car to photograph and partake since the little seating they had was occupied.

OMG it was the most delicious breakfast I've had as a vegan thus far!! The wrap was perfectly crispy from the panini press. The cheese and the veganaise gave a perfect creaminess--a texture I often miss as a vegan. The grits had the most perfect consistency and didn't need anything added. As a former cheese grits addict, it was unbelievable.   And what better than my aranciata to wash it all down!  Breakfast of champions!

The garlic sesame noodles were absolutely amazing and I enjoyed the mock chicken salad as well, though I typically like mine with a little bit firmer of a texture.But the flavor was spot on!

So happy I made it here finally! This will be my go to place for vegan breakfast going forward. Now just to find 
sit down vegan breakfast and vegan brunch!!"}
{"text":"Hello friends,

This place packs a punch.. or bunch..ahhh maybe a bit of both. I must admit my 1st time there I walked thru & told my friend, \"this place reminds me of Common Market near the Chicken Coop\". His reply.. \"It IS C.M. I guess you didn't see the sign\" 

Well anyyywayyyyy, on a busy night it can get tight on the inside. Since i was enjoying a fine stooge I stayed on the outside in front (which was pretty big). My bud bought a 6 pack of a mix of beer and we were off!!

Go enjoy,
TTFN"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Got a breakfast scramble which was delicious! It came with a choice or greens/reds drink or coffee. I got the reds and loved it. All for only 6 bucks. What a deal. Every staff member I ran into was super nice and took care of me and the other people really well."}
{"text":"what a shit hole food is gross and beer is way over priced and the help are thugs. its really like being on west side of charlotte
guy was picking his nose while making my sandwich through right in the trash.  young hipster wannabes.  go ask for steve he will smile at you.  not. thug life.    
blake the owner doesnt care about his customers. so many better places in southend like crafts tasting room  

it's definitely not macs speed shop not even close. thugs"}
{"text":"Gold mine!

I visited this place recently with my brother.  After a long afternoon of outdoor labor, I was more than excited to hear that we were going to purchase a couple of cold ones to unwind. 

When we pulled up to this place, I thought to myself \"Where in the hell has he brought me?\" I definitely learned that you cannot judge a book by its cover after visiting this place.  We made our way to the back of the store near the beer display case where my brother began to strike up a conversation with a man whom he knows simply as \"the beer man\". I don't know if I would ever want to be affectionately known as the beer man myself, but this man has definitely earned the moniker in my eyes.

Glancing at the beer display, I quickly realized that I was familiar with less than 20% of the beer selections and had actually only had about 10%.  Thats where the beer man comes in.  I think he could sense the hesitation in me with regards to my search, so he came over and began to give us a ten minute spiel on the different kinds of beers that he stocks, what they taste like, what they are made from, where they are brewed, etc. We went with his recommendation and were very satisfied with our purchase.

It is interesting to see the very different blend of people that frequent this place. I even saw a guy there that was dressed like Prince from the Purple Rain movie.

If you are looking to sit back and drink a good beer rather than the traditional busch or miller product, I would highly recommend making your way to the Common Market for a wide range of quality beer selections.

Oh yeah, they have other stuff too."}
{"text":"FINALLY!  After reading so many good reviews, and seeing all my fellow Yelpers check into this place, I got an invite to The Common Market and I immediately felt cooler.  

First mistake (and only mistake) I made??  I went to the wrong one...LOL!  Ooops.  I thought there was only one...but there's two.  DOH! Rookie cool person.....

The good:  I, again, felt cooler just by getting an invite.  The place has a plethora of beer selections.  I'm not typically a beer drinker but I am starting to appreciate a good beer.  Bud light was my idea of good...I've been set free from that type of thinking.  They also have a great selection of wines.  I bought a malbec and it was delish.  Atmosphere is so causual with lots of locals chatting.  There are places to sit at the tiny bar and a small section inside with small roundtables.  The patio is a nice size and I can only imagine it's uberly packed in the summer time.  Lots of pretty hipster people and a wide range in age!  Comforting! (Minus the two children that were there throwing rocks??  *Looking around* Where are the parents??)

The ummm:  Place is rather cramped.  It was PACKED Friday night at around 6.  I was a little overwhelmed but quickly calmed when I saw the cool people that invited me and hubster.  

Parking is a headache.  Be prepared.  

I didn't get a chance to order any food but I hear the food is pretty good.  I hope to go back and try some of their sandwiches and such.  Overall a good place to hang w/ friends! I'm sure once I try the food, I'll bump up my stars to a 4."}
{"text":"So I've been here before to hang with my friends on the patio on a Friday night which is fun in and of itself. But today, I visited the deli for lunch after checking out their menu online. I walked in and was promptly helped, I told the girl taking orders I was between two sandwiches, a main staple on their menu and one of the daily specials. She convinced me to get the daily special and boy am I happy I did (see photo). The sandwich was called \"Spicy Turkey\". Basically it's turkey, sriracha, jalepños, banana peppers, red peppers and ghost pepper cheese. Yes, it was spicy, but also delicious! Once you order you can peruse the store and pay at the front, I went during peak lunchtime so there was a bit of a wait while the sandwich was being made, but I had nowhere to be so I did't mind.  I will definitely be back another day!"}
{"text":"A cool little shop with specialty beers, sake, wines and snacks.  Also a nice selection of beer on tap.  There is a deli area where you can get food, but it closes fairly early most days. 

Do not hang out front very long if you don't like cigarettes.  The front patio is smoke-ville.  The back patio is supposed to be smoke free, but people sneak I think.  I prefer the back to the front, however.  

It's pretty loud inside, so good to stop & get beer to take home or just for a quick drink and maybe a snack, I love their snacks! Unique jerky, chips and various other items to choose for make it a good place for something to munch while enjoying a nice draught."}
{"text":"This is a clt must. One of the first places I went in clt and I've been a frequent customer since. Drink eat or just shop and leave. Great location in south end. Downside is it will soon be converted to condos so go soon!"}
{"text":"Gotta love CM. Employees are always chill and awesome, their beer selection is tops (come with some cash to spend, microbrews are not cheap), and the deli kicks booty for both meaters and non-meaters alike. I have to admit a current addiction to the chickpea-batter fried cashews-- its like a cashew falafel, SO good."}
{"text":"Meh, I like mine better. This is the last place I ever expected to hear a remix of the Thong Song being spun, so that may have something to do with my lukewarm feelings. 

Patio is a plus - nice tables, covered areas, comfier than the C/W CM, but I didn't see a stage area, so not sure if they're doing live music.  Less stuff on the shelves here than the other outpost but the beer selection is still rad. Open interior, bright colors, weird neuron-looking sculptures hanging from the ceiling. As comprehensive a selection of chotchkeys - we saw bacon floss. Eclectic crowd. Dug on the little brick alleyway they're hid beyond, very euro. Bathrooms are ridiculously large but very clean.

So ya! Once this CM gets broken in a bit, it'll be awesome."}
{"text":"What an awesome find for a first time visitor to Charlotte!  I was actually in Charlotte over night and stayed near the airport, but soon discovered there is nothing decent to eat in that area.  So as always, I pull up the Yelp app, searched sandwiches (because yes, I crave a good sammich!) and the CM came up.  After reading one review that meantioned deli, beer and wine, I was already pulling up directions.  Pretty easy to get to, which is saying a lot for this directionally challenged girl =)

The place was pretty busy for a Wednesday night, but I easily found my way around.  I hit up the deli in the back for a chicken salad sandwich on marbled rye and a bag of chips.  While I waited for the sammich to be freshly made, I admired the extensive beer selection and was impressed for a place like this.  The great thing is that whatever beer or wine you buy you can plop right down at one of their tables and test it out!  Next time I shall do this, especially if its patio weather.  This time, being the great wife I am, bought a 4-pack of a local beer (recommended by a guy that works there, super friendly!) to bring back as a souvenir for my hubby.  I took the sammich and chips back to my hotel room to consume and it was really good.  Can't wait to try the Moo-hoo, chocolate milk stout.  They have quite a selection of food items to choose from (and other deli items you can buy prepackaged) so next time I will definitely try something new.  

Love, Love, Love finding places like this!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have a really good beer selection that's unique and diverse. The coffee is quite good here too! The only downfall is this place is it can get a little crowded but I guess that just speaks to how cool it is.

I love little places like this."}
{"text":"I'm a fan..stumbled upon this and was intrigued by the courtyard and casual atmosphere. Its a great place to sip beers with friends or to just people watch. They have food, a large selection of beers, and the staff was overall helpful. I  had a vegan/gluten free cookie and milk stout nitro in my efforts to be hip and while they were good I did not have a chance to check out the deli. Will update once I have. Overall a great place for the autumn days and nights to come and am looking forward to checking out their other location."}
{"text":"Pretty great location- near a light rail stop, has its own parking, and a small courtyard.  Excellent beer selection and really friendly staff.  If you work uptown, its a great place to grab a sandwich for lunch.  The deli menu is great an imaginative, or you can create your own.  

The best part about CM is the atmosphere.  It's a great place to hang out and have a coffee or beer, bring a date, or get a few quick groceries made by real people.  

They have wine tastings, a cool out door courtyard, buttons and bumper stickers and fun stuff on the walls."}
{"text":"Love this place! Beers on tap, vegan options at the deli, and ample seating.  This is a market as well as a gathering place.  The patio is rather large, the staff is friendly, and the beer is cold.  
It's hard to example this little eclectic market.  They have really random merchandise for sale.  A great wine selection, local vegan/raw products, and a deli.  The deli has great sandwiches and soup.  It's so hot in charlotte I can't image why you would ever want soup, but it's an option! 
It gets really busy on Food Truck Friday but if you don't mind a crowd go on a Friday.  If you are hesitant of crowds I would try a Sunday or weekday evening.
Love it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The idea of just going there gets me all excited. There are some many reasons I love the Common Market, but numero Uno is the atmosphere/vibe. It's so laid back and chill, but everyone is having a great time. People are so nice and will offer up suggestions, wanted or not ( I always want them) on what to check out. It's always fun to explore and see what new/different products they have. I try something new every time visit, ranging from some snacks ( great cookies), different beverages (Kombucha, get it, you won't regret it) wine, beer etc. I am sure to be by more often now with summer rapidly approaching, and it is walking distance from my house."}
{"text":"Great South End spot to grab dinner on your way home from work or hang out for a laid back night out. Their deli and cold case has amazing quick meals and snacks that are perfect to pair with their reasonable alcohol prices. They often have live music on their patio, so buy a six pack (which they will open for you), hang out and take the rest of the beer home if you need to :)"}
{"text":"Beer, hangout, deli, hip, convenient, local, cool. I'm sure there are many other words you can use to describe The Common Market but I like these. Stopped in the other day to grab a few things and ended up with a Greenman IPA and a grilled pimento cheese sandwich w/ tomato and bacon. I think it was 1:30pm on a Thursday. Yep, I don't normally drink a brew with lunch but something about this place just says \"go ahead, no judgment here\". I'm glad I did. The sandwich was fantastic. Nice, crunchy sourdough bread and warm creamy pimento cheese. This place is also a plus for people watching!! See you soon!"}
{"text":"I went by this place on a Saturday just to get a sandwich and a drink.

The sandwich choices were very varied and the prices for them were reasonable. between 7-10 bucks.

Now if you looking for a beer WOW! Ok I am not much of a beer drinking but they have a large selection of the regular and lots of international beers that look quite interesting to try.

If your by this place I recommend that you check it out.

The outside is dog friendly"}
{"text":"Fun and funky market with a good variety of wines and beers, including options on tap and gluten free. Lots of snack foods, late night bites,  or even brunch or lunch options if you're coming in during the morning or daytime. They have live music on Saturdays, and it's a great place to hang out, relax with friends, or just people watch."}
{"text":"This spot is solid for lunch/brunch, coffee and picking up some drinks. The patio is not my favorite spot to hang out in Charlotte (too much cigarette smoke for me) but there is definitely a community of people who love it and that's cool. The employees are always really, really nice and friendly. 

As for food, we like to go for the Sunday brunch (ends at 1 pm). I love the ranchero and the folks in the deli are always super gracious about the modifications I ask for. My husband loves the pimento cheese grilled sandwich (add bacon and tomato), as well as the pimento cheese grits. 

It's a Charlotte staple and I would definitely recommend a visit. I loved the South End location and am looking forward to them reopening in that area."}
{"text":"Is this place overpriced? Ehhh, yeah. But is it tasty? Absolutely. I've never had anything that wasn't really fresh, which makes sense because they make stuff fresh to order. This also means that if you go at a busy time (aka- lunch time) you'll have a little bit of a wait. 

I love the bagel sandwiches. My boyfriend loves the pimento deluxe. They have a great selection of chips and drinks (sodas, beer, etc). The people who work there are always friendly, which is a major plus. 

Overall, a great local spot"}
{"text":"Great bar and large section of Beers to choose from. It looks like a gas station but it is a awesome place to hang out or go out with a group of people."}
{"text":"They don't carry any of my favorite beers and I still want to make this a regular stop on my weekends. I've only been once, but I hear tales of live music and delicious food....
I love the crowd, all hipster ish and semi conscious and somehow still cool about it. It's a great space even though there's a complete disregard for one's desire to sit down. You can still make it work if you try, though. My friend and I found some space on the patio bench and pretty much camped out with our purchases. It was good."}
{"text":"Just terrible service. My wife has an out of state id, so do I- same state, but they refused to serve her, claiming they don't accept out of state IDs. Btw she's older than me. Served me though. Terribly rude to her. Terrible service, illegal, inconsistent ID vetting, never going back again.  The hipsters can taken their trash and smoke it, as I'm assuming that's all their employees are good for."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The breakfast Sammies are on point and the people that work here are the best. The outside area has a hipster but awesome string light setting that's a great place to grab a beer."}
{"text":"As if anything negative can be said about the CM Commonwealth. This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte and I go there as often as I can. Walking in is like entering a cave of wonders. The entire place if filled with all sorts of snack foods and sundries which are unique, interesting and fun.

The deli is another great feature of this gem which has many a unique and great tasting sammiches along with a variety of other packaged food that range from vegan dished I'd never dare touch to great individual salads.

Which brings to my favorite part of the place, being a beer nerd and all, the nearly unlimited selection of beers and wine. The Common Market boasts not only of a large selection of macro and micro brews but with a staff that truly enjoys and is knowledgeable of all things beer. Tom, Jason and the rest of the staff can not only pour you a perfect pint but give you all sorts of data and unique facts of whatever you're drinking. Wednesday nights' free tastings are great for those venturing out into the craft beer world as you can sample a variety of beers for free.

The CM has the feel of a backyard lounge where all your friends will eventually swing by or come to hang out. Everyone seems to know each other and the crowd is very varied and eclectic (I've always wanted to use that word).

Ultimately, the CM is a great place to hang out and relax as most anyone will find something for them there."}
{"text":"A staple of the Plaza Midwood community. Ask around where to get a cheap beer. The answer will be CM. Ask around where to get a craft beer. The answer will be CM. Where to try a nice wine flight. The answer once again CM. Common Market is not fancy but they will surprise you with their many options. 

Food is another bonus. You can get a healthy lunch no issue here and it will be very tasty. They've got snacks if you don't have time and don't forget the beer/wine to go if you are having a little get together at a house. 

CM is unique. It can be dirty but that's expected at a dive like this. The bathrooms show tons of character. They don't please everyone but that's the way it goes most time. Expect large crowds in the night times and realize they will be hipster and they will be weird. This place puts Charlotte on the map and whether it's day or night you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love this place. Sad to see it move. Amazing, chill outdoor space. Cheap beer and wine you can open on site. Open always which is always a plus."}
{"text":"It's a loud, crowded little hipster spot, but the pimento cheese is even better than what I make at home. (I haven't figured out how they're doing it, but believe me, I'm working on it.) Pair that with a good craft beer and it's a fantastic lunch. Note that the sandwich counter isn't open Sunday evenings.

Also, what's with the jerks who need to express their political disapproval about a neighborhood deli? Eat your sandwich or don't, but nobody cares that you're a conservative until you cram it down our throats."}
{"text":"This is one of those Queen City institutions that I show off to any friends and family from out of town. CM may only be just ten years old, but it has countless lives' worth of personality and flavor. Each time I visit, I still find something I've never seen before among the decor which is full of character. Their excellent beer selection is always changing, and don't miss out on the deli. They make great sandwiches to order. My favorite brunch item is the huevos rancheros in a spinach wrap. The patio is also great for people watching; everyone is welcome at the Common Market."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Cool vibes. Go and hang out, chill, listen to or play some music. Enjoy some food from the deli or pick an eclectic mix of brews from inside the store. Sit in or outside. It's whatever and it's a pretty dope hangout if I do say so myself!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the large drink selection and the outdoor seating in Southend, but it can get packed pretty quickly.  Haven't tried the food, but it looks and sounds good"}
{"text":"Must do experience if you live or are visiting Charlotte. The deli is amazing, I recently started having breakfast there and am sad all this time Ive only been doing lunch!!! There is a large selection of beer and wine which you can enjoy in the store. They also sell excellent baked goods, a good selection of vegan/veg products and weird/interesting candies/toys etc."}
{"text":"Amazing. I always take out of towners to CM. Best sandwiches in charlotte, amazing breakfast and the atmosphere is great. I order lunch from here at least 2-3 times a month, if not more. Does get busy during weekday lunch so if you are on a time crunch order ahead. Great patio area and lots of happenings (music, tastings etc)"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a few times as it is very convenient to Uptown/Morehead area where I work. Menu has great variety, and every day there is a different sandwich on \"special\" that 9 times out of 10 I end up getting instead of whatever I was thinking of. The deli definitely gets crowded around lunch time so make sure you have some time to wait, especially if you get a hot sandwich, but the wait is worth it and the staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Deli meets corner store meets underground bar. This place was cool before cold was invented. Great good, great people watching, great refreshments -- it's Great. With a capital G. And a capital CM, as in Coolest Market or Charlotte's Mainplacetohangoutbecauseitssoawesomeandyoushoulddefinitelygo."}
{"text":"I like the vibe overall here and I appreciate what they are trying to do.  What a great spot for people watching, unique treats/grub, wine/beer tasting, live music, outdoor patio, etc.

The indoor seating is a little tight so I wouldn't say it is comfortable to just \"hang out\" there but the outdoor patio may be the way to go if you just want a casual place to grab a sandwich and a glass of wine.  

The problem I have with this place is that I feel like even though it is a casual, low key spot, there is too much effort in trying to be casual and low key.  Make sense?  Its like you still get sized up for how hipster you can appear and I feel like there were quite a few unfriendly wannabe cool peeps in the mix.  If you have to \"TRY\" to look hipster or if you wake up thinking hard about what to wear so you can fit into an artsy crowd then it isn't coming natural for you and just give it up.  If you are truly laid back then the atmosphere should feel relaxed, not \"casual pretentious.\"  It isn't like this place is located in the East Village of NYC..let's all calm down and relax.  Other reviews mentioned the customer service being a problem and there was one guy in particular that must of been \"that guy.\" He was rude, arrogant and not helpful whatsoever.  The others were very sweet though!

The food we ordered was good...the panini and the veggie wrap.  We picked up some of the pimento cheese which was okay, not the best I have had and we tried a couple of their fresh cookies...again, okay.  I do love the fact they have gluten free/ vegan options sprinkled throughout the shop.

I do really like the concept of this place but I'm not sold on the vibe they are dropping.  Again, \"cool\" and pretentious don't mix."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is amazing, great drink specials, and by far one of the coolest atmospheres."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so laid back, GREAT beers, cool crowd. No yuppies (that I could tell). Hard to find in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really.. What needs to be said? Go there! Leave your judgement at the door, get an awesome beer and pimento cheese with some bomb ass chips and chill out!! If your dog can behave, bring it. (Same goes for your friends.) Everyone here is laid back and friendly, Tuesday is open mic and Jake the Ukulele player will fill your ears with delightful versions of TI and Kid Cudi, Random nights of beer sampling and the best vegan options around (and I'm not even vegan.. or else that's how I would have started this review, and it would be in my biography.. And you would know it.) All around it's a great place... 

Hey Walker!! Hey TJ!! (Say hey if they're working, they're awesome.)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome vibe and lots of great beers!
They have a huge selection of beer and let me sample a few kinds to pick the best one!"}
{"text":"Ever been to the Paper Skyscraper in Dilworth?  Yea - like that, only with delicious sandwiches, hard to find chips, a sweet outdoor patio area, and Garbage Pail Kids cards - that's right... Garbage Pail Kids cards.

I've had multiple types of sandwiches now and they've all been much better than average.  The Common Market is slowly creeping up on, and taking over my top choice for sandwiches in Charlotte, RiRa's sandwich bar.  

The Jack Kennedy (egg salad, bacon, horseradish) is good, but I like the Reuben on marble rye even better.

If you're a soup person, they're selection is top notch and fresh daily.  

The real tip is to get there before noon.  Your wait time  for them to make your samich before noon on a weekday? about 5 minutes - after noon?  about 25.  At least there's a bunch of cool shtuff to look at, including some crazy one-off beers, wines, and desserts."}
{"text":"This place is awesome really eclectic and a very laid back atmosphere. I've been to  this one and the South End location . This is a great place for lunch and to  gather with friends for beer and wine."}
{"text":"Last week I was here 4 times; I think it's safe to say, \"I love this place\"!

The Common Market has a great selection of all kinds of drinks (alcoholic and non), snacks and oddities from Archie McPhee (my favorite store in Seattle). It's a really chill place to grab some food and drink and just sit down with friends for some good conversation. I don't drink, so it's a great place to go with friends who do where we can all enjoy our own thing without pressure to order more.

The staff and other people who come here have always been friendly and nice.

And to top it off, they have boar's head meats and cheeses and make a damned good sandwich (breakfast and lunch)!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to find rare beers and NC beers from the breweries. Really tasty bison chocolate bars and lime chips. Also had fresh squeezed OJ for 4.00 nice. The people working here are really nice and friendly the only way to be. They gave me Common Place stickers and told me about future events like food truck Friday and directions to the Unknown Brewery. A diamond in the ruff is this little place I tell ya."}
{"text":"Interesting little (crammed) place!

The service was friendly and helpful. I got the tree hugger wrap (sub hummus for cream cheese to make vegan) from the deli and the vegan stuffed grape leaves from the reach-in. Um....BEST stuffed grape leaves ever! The wrap was pretty good too. A little pricey for a wrap ($7.25), but the stuffed grape leaves ($2.49) seemed reasonable. They have several vegan sandwich options and the vegan items in the reach-in are clearly marked, so I will come again!"}
{"text":"Ended up here by chance since the restaurant I wanted to go to had lost power but was pleasantly surprised. 

It was a Sunday night so it was pretty low key but the food was really good (try the braised pork) and they had they had Delirium on draft. 

I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a cool place! Part deli, part market, part wine/beer spot... What's not to love?! We finally decided to give this place a shot tonight and boy were we glad we did. Wanted a quick bite and found they had boat head foods. I found it so hard to order, everything looked so good! I ended up going with the hot mama panini and a small roasted bell pepper Gouda soup, the soup was my fav! I regret not getting a large. The panini was alright, would have been better if I added salmon for $4 and used hoagie bread. The tuna melt sounded bomb, save for next time! The bf got the chicken salad sandwich, it was really bland.. I was not a fan. It needs some kick or sauce to it. Not bad for $6-7 of quality sandwich. 

I can't wait to come back and actually sit down to enjoy the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Tank topped hipsters. 

Beer. Deli sandwiches. Vegan/vegetarian food. Jesus action figures. 

Apathetic and mediocre. A familiar old friend."}
{"text":"Okay, so I go here for beer and socializing. For that this place gets four stars. It is unique, the clientele is .... Interesting, and the beer and wine selection is the best possible within four miles of my house. When I come in here to buy beer(let me know if your experience is similar), I tend to spend 15-20 minutes in the beer aisle, eyes 10 inches from the glass. The salivation and incredible indecision have to make my alcoholism and beer snobbery apparent.  If you like beer and wine and live near this place it should be your go-to \"support a local business\" place to stock up for your grill out, fancy dinner party, or lonely binge. 

On to the food, though. I don't like it. Maybe it's just not my style but ive eaten here three times and never enjoyed it. Take that with a grain of salt, my friends sing their praises to the high heavens of the deli. 

In summation: buy beer here. Buy wine here. Imbibe in the unique atmosphere, with some unique music, then stroll over to snug harbor for a crowd so unique you won't even think you're still in Charlotte. Try the food, if you like it let me know, I want to find something I like to eat here!"}
{"text":"I love how eclectic common market is. It's my go to place for craft beers and the best breakfast sandwiches in plaza."}
{"text":"I don't know if there's anything about CM I don't love. Maybe the parking sitch during the day when it's particularly hopping but that's so not their fault :)

This place is a deli w many vegetarian and vegan options, a watering hole w delicious beer, wine, and my fave -sake!- available to purchase and enjoy on site (hello, pregame?), a performance space showcasing local talent (DJs, live music inside the place and outside on the patio, female wrestling out back, noise show, etc), and the perfect location to buy White Elephant/Crazy Gift Exchange gifts (seriously, they've got loads of kitschy things). 

Their grilled cheese and soup daily special is filling, yummy, and a steal at only $6. The selection of kombucha teas rival Healthy Home Market and Earth Fare. The music on Thurs & Fri nights always provide eargasms. The sake selection is expanding and I'd like to think it has a tiny bit to do w me turning all my fellow CM goers on to the bottles of nigori they carry. 

In case you are wondering: No, I don't nor have I ever worked at CM and no, I'm not dating anyone that works there. I'm just a girl sitting in front of Yelp.com asking it to love Common Market."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and love the fact that they have vegetarian and vegan options. And they happen to have the bet cookie in Charlotte- the chocolate chip potato chip cookie!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool I must say. They have so many wacky nick knacks all over alone. Just looking around I know where a my \"fun and joke\" gifts will come from. The atmosphere is eccentric and the staff is pretty nice. 

they also have food especially for the vegan types. I am not a vegan, however I do love the food from time to time. My favorite are the breakfast sandwiches. The selection of beer and win is really good. 

This is also a little hangout spot with a back patio. I usually visit here early in the morning. Parking is not great, but not many places in that area are. I would recommend stopping in here at least once, especially in the morning for the breakfast."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky when it comes to chicken salad so I was hesitant to try it. I got it on a croissant and it was pretty good. I would recommend getting it with lettuce and tomato because it does not have a ton of flavor on its on."}
{"text":"Cool little place in South End. I had some good breakfast sandwiches and snacks. 

Only downside is the douche bag attitude of the people at the deli counter."}
{"text":"LOVE The Common Market!!

I usually stop by here first before I head to the lines of Food Truck Friday. This place has a HUGE selection of wine and beer. They also have a great little back patio area that has a wonderful neighborhood feel to it. 

*Best Tip I've learned for this location: You can check-out at the back bar if the line to the front register is too long. You're welcome : )"}
{"text":"Fake hipsters running the place. Keep your shellfish away. Policy for outside food is to protect bottom line, but they will give you a BS line that it relates to food allergies. Please. Tear the place down already. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. There are all types (seriously, all types) of people who come here. And you will see regulars if you go often enough. My favorite times to go are weekend nights to sit/stand out on the front patio and have a few drinks or in the morning to grab a breakfast sandwich from the deli. The beer and wine selection here is great. Pick from the fridge or grab something on tap from the bar. Some nights they have bands play in pretty much any space they can find - inside by the bar, in the little alley, out front. Check out all the other little snacks and knick-knacks for sale. It's like a weirdo's Cracker Barrel in there and I love it."}
{"text":"Made the trek up to PMW with some friends recently to grab beers at Common Market. I wasnt sure what to expect when we walked in - It's a mixture of a bar, a deli, a craft beer shop and a knick-knack store. It's got a good sized patio that's perfect for kicking back and people watching (if you're in to that sort of thing). Blue Ribbon tall boys are priced cheap and the cans are ice cold. Overall the staff was friendly except for the bartender who was just too hip to actually give an answer a simple question. Make it a point to stop in - it grows on you more the longer you stay."}
{"text":"Very chill spot to grab a drink and a GREAT sandwich!
Alot of various hard to find drink's to choose from. Love that they have drinks I remember from my childhood.
The few times we have been, the staff have been really personable and make you feel at home. 
Anytime we are on that side of Charlotte and want a sandwich and a drink...this is our spot!
Real neighborhood feel!"}
{"text":"There's really nothing bad I can say about this place, the atmosphere the people and their products are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Oh Common Market... how I love thee...  Aside from being footsteps away from my home, the Common Market is a great place to find beverages and great sandwiches.  I have heard their coffee is pretty darn good - with a name like \"Sexy Power\" the coffee cannot be bad, right?  But I mostly come in to buy beer here, with the occasional bottle of wine.

A nice little alley way will lead you into a courtyard with a myriad of tables of which you will find people hanging out, dogs wandering about... its a nice cozy place.  Since it's winter, there are some heaters out in the patio, but looks like most of the smokers are out there puffing away.

When you walk in, a small bar counter is located on the right with about 8-10 beers on tap, usually rotates on a non-set-schedule.  Just check the chalkboard and the bartender is pretty knowledgeable to help you find the drink of choice.  A small section of tables and chairs are in the center with all kinds of merchandise surrounding you.  Racks of wine and beer coolers/refrigerators are in the back.  

If you go past the tables and past the wine shelves to the right is the sandwich counter to where you can order your sandwich.  Always made fresh by the kick-ass guys/gals in the back.  While your waiting for your sandwich, walk around and peruse the shelves... or grab a beer.  

There is a secondary entrance closer to the cash register and leads out to a parking lot (connected to the Tryon side of the building).

Very very unique and cool place to hang out with friendly people."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang out in Charlotte! I enjoy this location over the plaza midwood one. They have very friendly staff who remember their regulars. I love the variety of drinks/food and the back patio is awesome!"}
{"text":"Tired of playing the chain game when it comes to Charlotte restaurants and pubs? Step outside of your burger box and $9.99 bottle of grocery store wine, and get yourself into The Common Market on S. Tryon Street! 

Prior to meeting up with a fellow Yelper, I will admit I was a Common Market virgin. But, after perusing the isles of endless wines, wandering past the daily deli specials, and settling into the charming common area I gladly handed over my CM V-card.   Looking back it's hard to believe that I have overlooked such a great place for so long.  The Common Market is a \"you want it, they got it\" kind of store. They've effortlessly crossed off everything on my list, I bet they'd do the same to yours.

THE LIST:

 Food: Hungry for breakfast, lunch or dinner? Swing by the deli for some fresh daily specials. Or make your way towards the front of the store to indulge in a junk food frenzy, and old school pop shop filled with nearly every soda you could possibly imagine.  

 Spirits: Racks on top of racks, and stacks on top of stacks of wine?! What could be more fine?! Well, let me tell you. The Common Market has wine on racks and beer on tap. So feel free to grab a few friends and enjoy your drink of choice at one of The Common Market community events. The more the merrier!

 Atmosphere: The perfect mid-day get away. Quaint, Cozy and Contemporary with just a hint of artistic expression The Common Market certainly captivates the eye of its clientele. Customers are sure to enjoy the comfort of CM's eclectic decor while dining in the perfectly mismatched common area, surrounded by multicolored walls and various works of art. I can best describe the interior design of The Common Market as a seamless blend of \"a little bit of old and a little bit of new.\" 
The staff here generously gives all of their clientele a refreshing dose of southern hospitality. On my first visit to CM I did not touch one door as I made my way into the market. A kind male customer and an amicable CM staff member thoughtfully opened both doors for me. I was amazed! Chivalry isn't dead; it's alive and kickin at The Common Market. I was also bid \"good morning\" by both of these men and the kind woman working behind the register. Such considerate and genuine people I'd encountered on my visit. The kindness must be contagious because as I left CM I was all smiles. Their customer service alone could keep me coming back for more.    

So it's safe to say if you're looking for a niche, to fix your itch to change up your pace, choose The Common Market, and while you're there have a taste.

{"text":"Visited this local deli recently while on a business trip.  Went in and ordered the Evil Homer, their most popular cold sandwhich.  The sandwhich was made from quality ingredients and while it wasn't bad it also wasn't anything special.  It was a basic turkey sandwhich with bacon lettuce, onions, pickles and cheese.  The price was good around 7.50 for the sandwhich if I remember correctly and their selection of beers and ales were superb.  Definitely a good place to stop by for a quick lunch, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
