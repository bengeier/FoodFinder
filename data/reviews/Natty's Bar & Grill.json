{"text":"Service was terrible, Beer was flat, Food was overcooked and nachos had no cheese.  Server was rude and unfriendly from the start, found her to be extremely arrogant and insulting at times. Would highly recommend you save your money and time."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here on Saturday.  There were a few mainstay on draft, such as Coors, Guinness, Blue, Bud, Stella, etc.  No Stream Whistles, though.  The ambiance is like a diner plus a bar. The crowd was around middle aged the evening I was there.  It might be because some were waiting for the comedy show to start next door.  If this was their normal crowd, then it was not much of a meeting place.  For food, their wings smelled good (we didn't order).  They have a vension vegetables soup. Sounds interesting."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite corner bars.  I love this place.  It's all about the people.  They used to be open Christmas night. Frequented by Julian of the Trailer Park Boys (so I've been called, so I've been told)."}
