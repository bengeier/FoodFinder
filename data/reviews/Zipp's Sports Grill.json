{"text":"I have been here a few times and figured it's time to write a review. This place, overall is an all right spot. They have happy hour specials practically all night, every night. The only time they seem to lack happy hour is from 7pm to 8pm lol. And I know that they have weekend specials for those weekend ball games and whatnot. It's awesome. The food is pretty yum too. The only reason I didn't give the place four stars is due to my experience tonight.   Zipps is a sports bar. And it's football (pre)season. They should have at least one TV dedicated to the home team, but they. I get that they couldn't get the ASU game due to the whole TV dispute, but to not have the Cards - Bronco game is ridiculous considering it's on ABC. And when they finally did have it on, it was a bit difficult to have someone change the channel on the right TV. I get that it was busy, but that shouldn't be an excuse to not listen to your customers. If anything, they should make a conscious effort to hear their customers and make sure they're happy.   Anyways, I'm sure i'll go back some time, but I'll probably have to call ahead and make sure they have the games I want on."}
{"text":"My Hubby and I luv bar food with out the bar scene. We went on Sunday evening to grab our meal to go and so we can watch movies while we get our grub on. I haven't been to zips in years but I knew exactly what I wanted (errr NEEDED)! The famous Zipps Golden wings, yes!!! Our server was by far outstanding! I forgot her name but she was fantastic and kept us hydrated as we waited for our meal. Thank u for dinner Zipps!"}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio. Typical sports bar. Our server was nice enough, said she's worked here for 16 years. Too bad she couldn't describe the difference between their cup of chili and their bowl (a $1 difference). Pay the extra buck to avoid getting pissed at the salsa cup it comes in, lol. Also, we got the Monaco focaccia sammich wrap, which wasn't bad, although the surrounding birds received most of the excessive breading. Our server offered spending an extra buck-fitty since we were splitting the wrap, in order to receive separate sides. If you are into flavorless, deepfried potatoes and flour-covered, seasonless onion slivers, I highly suggest these side orders if you like to waste your money. Aside from the nice patio environment and decent, greasy chili, I would've rather picked up hotdog and thirst buster at circle jerk and saved about 23 bucks, lol!"}
{"text":"Focaccias!!!  I get the Monaco religiously and have them put some wing sauce in it + that jalapeno dipping sauce on the side = delicious!   I don't live in AZ anymore but Zipps is a mandatory stop every time I'm back because of this single item.  Have the Monaco with a giant blue moon and some medium golden wings and you won't be disappointed even if the team you came to watch loses  :)"}
{"text":"You must have at least 4 people in your group to have a table to yourself!  I used to have a lot of business meetings with clients at this place (at least twice a week) as it was right down the street from my office.  The food is not great and the service is unusually horrible but they have a big selection for my business clients to choose from as most have different tastes and it is more of a relaxing environment in which most like. One Sunday, 2 friends and I were having lunch at a table for four people.  They sat a stranger with us to have lunch....very awkward, but was okay as we were all drinking beers.  About two weeks later (on a Friday), I was entertaining potential clients discussing our company and answering other questions.  There were three of us sitting at a table for four people.  They had the \"balls\" to sit another guy at our table as they say they were now sitting groups together to fill all spots.  I told the manager that we were discussing business as he seemed to not care and still sit the guy with us.  Needless to say, I have never returned to a zipps and never will."}
{"text":"I set foot into the fire, and felt the burn on my tongue.  I like wings, I always have.  The spicier the better, and finding wings that have that right amount of burn and flavor is hard to find.  Some places like to make their wings so hot that they sacrifice flavor for the prestige of being the hottest wings in the neighborhood, while some places have wings with all the right flavor, but you feel like a complete wimp for the lack of pain that you just consumed.  Zipps on Camelback is one of the those burn before flavor places, but only barely.  I heard about their \"hot\" wings, and scoffed at the idea of a trendy sports bar being able to cook my tongue with their sauce properly.  The waitress, a cute little number, came to us and took our order and I, being cocky and maybe somewhat stupid, told her to get my wings from the bottom of the barrel.  I didn't think they would exact some sick form of revenge on me for my boisterous dare.  I was wrong.  The wings came out in a good time, considering it was the early part of St Patrick's Day and they were a little busy.  As soon as they hit the table, my nose was filled with spicy aroma of habanero and vinegar, a good wing combination.  My grandfather, who smartly ordered tacos, looked at me like a priest reading rites to a death row inmate, smiled and wished me luck.  The first wing wasn't too bad.  I felt a little ting and smiled as I sucked it down.  Then I felt a little fire on the lips.  It was only slightly painful, but very managable.  I took the second wing in earnest, and bit down with the same defiant determination as the first.  More burn, but not too bad.  Around wings five, six and seven, I my head started to bead up.  Wings nine and ten, I was in full water sucking mode.  I didn't finish the wings...sadly a first for me.  I did take them home, thinking that they would be a great second day food.  Overall, I really liked the atmosphere.  I sat outside, so my addiction to cigarettes would be fulfilled, and my love of baseball was satisfied by the multiple big screens that surrounded the wooden tables and benches.  Service was top notch, and thank God the cups were huge (and filled with water).  I would recommend Zipps on Camelback because it is a good atmosphere and there is plenty of scenery in the female variety to look at.  The wings were good, not great.  Hot, but a little flavor was lost in the heat of it all.  My grandfather, a huge fan of tacos, raved about them, so I would trust them enough to go back and give them a whirl."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give the chicken ceasar salad a try yesterday and boy was that a mistake. The chicken was tasteless but I was starving and didn't want to wait to eat. After I finished my stomach immediately felt bloated and started churning. I came home got in bed and for the next twelve hours I had a fever of 103 and diarrhea. 24 hrs later still fighting low grade fever and stomach upset. Food poisoning or salmonella for sure. They have decent beer prices, but stay far away from the food."}
{"text":"Zipps is OK. Nothing really to write home about. I went there to watch the Bears game with friends who were in town from Chicago.  The food was all right -- I had the buffalo chicken fingers and fries.  Standard bar food. What I did like was that the atmosphere was really chill and relaxed and our server was great. She checked on us constantly and was super friendly. I'd probably go back..."}
{"text":"Food is always good and the specials are great but the service almost always sucks!!! The only location I get good service at is the Mcclintock and ray location."}
{"text":"Watery bloody and slow service. Terrible management."}
{"text":"best happy hour specials and pretty good customer service. I couldn't decide what flavor margarita to try and the server offered me suggestions, and then brought me her favorite. It was great & I appreciated her being willing to help me decide. I'll definitely be returning to Zipps."}
{"text":"awesome wings great place to watch a game, patio is nice but people smoke out there ... yuck!"}
{"text":"Great food, but u must get with the times and update and add more tvs, u call ur self a sports bar and have some of the worst situations to watch tvs"}
{"text":"Awesome place our kickball team goes here almost every Monday.. The staff is always nice and friendly and food and drinks are fast.. There prices are great. Love this place cant wait till next week for more...:)"}
{"text":"Usually stop in to pick up buffalo style wings \"hot\" extra crispy. Eat em all up every time. Spicy even though i need a glass of milk afterwards but not ridiculous where you can't enjoy them. They do warn you but don't be scared."}
{"text":"I finally dropped into Zipp's... and I'm so glad I did! Everything that was ordered at my table was uh-mazing. The chicken fingers are perfectly battered and fried to golden perfection! It seems like their chicken fingers and chicken skewers are specifically made differently on purpose. Both . They give generous portions, too.  One thing that I found interesting was their tacos. They apparently roll their tacos like a wrap? My order may have just gotten mixed up, but I didn't mind because the wrap was also wonderful. I definitely suggest if you want some good ol' American fried food."}
{"text":"I used to go here for lunch. I stopped when the service became so slow that I could not get wings and make it back within an hour. Recently went back and got the wings slightly faster, but one of them was raw. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Been going to this zipps for 10 years and will probably never go back( at least the scottsdale location) . Ordered drinks and food from a server and decided to close out with her to move to a more comfortable spot in a booth to watch the game. The two servers (old and new) chat for a few moments about the switch. New server walks by 12 times in 40 min and does not make any kind of contact with us. Everyone but us to be exact. Looked at us as she walked by every time. Nothing. Sounds like they've fired the wrong people. Lot of new unfriendly faces."}
{"text":"Yum! I've been here (Zipp's on Camelback) many times and the food is great. The Focaccias are probably my favorite (homemade bread) and you get a huge side of fries, onion rings, salad...all for about $8. (I've spent more in drive-throughs). AND \"our\" waitress is so the best! Her name is Erin (Eron). We totally sit in her section anytime we're there!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic tasting and juicy bunless turkey burger!  The traditional red basket my burger came in, was overflowing with a wonderful fresh house salad, that was a standard option in lieu of fries. Appreciated having such healthy and tasty options!    My friends elected to sit inside, but that patio outside looked so inviting.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great happy hour and wings are yummy. Highly recommend coming here for fights and sports!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 5 years. I'm a local and have been to every sports bar in Scottsdale. This is the best. Hands down, no question. Very, very friendly staff.  I usually get the buffalo focaccia sandwich with rings. Burgers and wings are also great. Huge beers, great happy hour specials, food is consistently good!  Stopped by Marleys on my bike earlier today while the football games were on. I know I misspelled it but Im too lazy and don't think enough of that place to bother with looking up the right spelling. Overpriced. I sat down on the patio and a hostess dropped a menu in front of me. No hello or any type of welcome. Not a word. Guess she was anxious to get back to texting.  Zipps is not owned by a local sports celebrity. That's a good reason to go there and not Marleys. They have outstanding food. Very reasonable prices. Super staff. I'm an airline pilot and eat at a lot of different places here and out of town. Zipps is simply one of the best.  (Not five stars because nobody believes those. This is a real deal review)"}
{"text":"***updated 6/25/15***   -GOLDEN WINGS (medium). still best in town. hh price remains at $6, but the nightly specials for wings has been relegated to only sun and mon nights at $6.50. i gather soon the specials will cost more than the regular price. but damn that golden medium sauce!  their new beer menu is now broken down to domestic, import and craft. which is highly unnecessary with little options they have. just a reason to tack on a import or craft tax. like a corona costs more than a ranger ipa or some shit like that just cause of the category it falls into. get real.  not much new on the food-front that i can tell. burrito deal on tuesday is decent.  and the website got a makeover.  4 starts is accurate.  -----------------------------------------------  ***updated 9/2/11***   3 years later im updating this review.  -GOLDEN WINGS (medium). still best in town. prices have gone up a bit to $6, available happy hour and mon, thurs, sat, sun after 8pm. the new chicken skewers are a change of pace for the same deal.  -specialty burgers. still rock. sweet japaleno may have taken over the top spot.  -fries. they have grown on me since then. still not award winning by any means but i like them a lot. i usually get the half and half cause the onion rings are also done very well, usually.  -focaccias. monaco is still tops. but you can just order a side of sweet jalapeno dressing with others and it turns out near similar.  -most of the other food turns out to be pretty good. but i stick to the staples above. ranch chop salad is very good, but also far from a 'healthy' salad.  -beer. big mugs went up a quarter during hh. still, the best deal around might be the $8 premium pitches sat and sun, open til 4p.  id put this up a half star if it would let me.  -----------------------------------------------  8/1/08  ive been frequenting this place for nearly 3 years now, its our go-to destination for happy hour or anytime really.. so here is my rundown..  -GOLDEN WINGS (medium). best in town. (happy hour,  mon & thur after 8pm = $5). the extreme difference between medium and hot is not worth it. good but way too hot..  -specialty burgers. most are fantastic.  ask for any sauce \"on the side\"! youll get more. (black n bleu is my fave).  -fries. fresh cut. not a fan, but will still enjoy them if the option is there.  -lately, the monaco foccacia or however you spell it. the jalapeno dip is awesome.  -all other food is mediocre at best. salad's salad.  -beer = 3.50 for big mug (domestic) is a good deal at happy hour.  THIS (and the wings) IS WHAT MAKES US COME BACK.  -tv's can be changed to what you want if youre there on an off-night.  -service is typically good.  -managers can be douchebags (is that new?).  -parking does kinda suck on crowded nights, but dont be so damn lazy.  i do agree with some of what 'Jason C.' says, but will rate this place higher. hes bitchin bout little things. if youre there at the right time (happy hour or after 8pm) and stick to the right food(s), you should have a good time!   [this applies to the Via de Ventura ZIPPS also]  GOLDEN medium WINGS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Zipps in Scottsdale and I was blown away! Our server was Mia, she was extremely sweet and friendly to us and obviously really cared about making us happy! We ordered wings and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, both were absolutely fantastic! As our entrees, we tried the Zipps wraps and a couple of slices of pizza, both of which were also phenomenal. LOVED the frozen margaritas and the whole atmosphere, the service was incredible and we would return to visit for that alone, and to top it off we had awesome food! We WILL be returning :)"}
{"text":"If you are gonna have a drink here you better drive home drunk.  If you leave your car there it gets towed."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers , nice place for friends family or just to hang out lots of tv a for the sports games and nice outside sitting area."}
{"text":"Awesome comment about the zipparita. I had the same experience and have also been going to that location and the other two in Scottsdale for a decade w no issues.  I was just at the zipps on via de Ventura got a chambord zipparita a week and a half ago and it was perfect as always.  Went to old town this weekend. No chambord. We all know what chambord looks like.  It's missing when I ordered it and paid for it.  Only the old town location! So I don't really buy the \"overpour\" excuse. The other locations get it right. And other restaurants that offer chambord zipps put the same pour. Nothing new.  And the fact that the manager \"floated\" some to appease me was a joke. I bartender in old town too.  I know what it's like to have too many liquor sales need to cut somewhere.  It's obvious they are starting there.   #savethechambord"}
{"text":"Love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing!  The bartender CJ is da bomb!"}
{"text":"40 degrees on the patio and four of their heat lamps don't work.  Apparently the owners are too cheap to fix them.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Had fun at happy hour there last week. Shelby was great! As much fun to talk to as she is to look at...if ya hear what I'm saying.  Food was good (wings) per usual. Shelby really stands out at this location."}
{"text":"Service is great, and the 32oz $4 dollar beer is awesome. And when the patio isnt packed its a good spot to hang at."}
{"text":"Big beers, strong margaritas, best wings in town, and several tv's playing sports. There isn't much to say other than I love this place.    Medium honey Hot buffalo wings. 32oz dos equis. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'd like to think I just went on a bad night and the atmosphere just really wasn't  my style. Instead of badmouthing the place I'll just say it came highly recommended and the atmosphere is loud and probably for someone who wants to watch the game."}
{"text":"This is a hard review ..... On the one hand the zipperitas are great .... And some of the happy hour prices are good  However  I have yet to have good service at this location, every time you order the servers make it seem like you are putting them out and are never very willing to be helpful   I also do not think they have never changed the fry oil since they opened"}
{"text":"Grossest thing I have ever seen. This place is filthy.    I ordered a pizza to go well done.  It came out barely cooked.  I asked the server to return it. They did and the next thing I noticed is one of their workers putting his thumb in our pizza and then they brought it to us us with a giant greasy thumb print on the box.  I asked the the manager about it and he said the cooks use rubber gloves to check the food temperature!  Gross!  I told him I'm looking at the cooks and none of them have gloves on.  Just bad. Do not eat here. Gross"}
{"text":"i liked the food, the service is quick and friendly, i could eat those onion rings all day.  and the amount of tvs located everywhere was a plus, for any sports fan!    a-ok with me"}
{"text":"Great customer service! My boyfriend and I always go to this location and the service is outstanding! Love the zipparitas!"}
{"text":"love the wings and 1000 island burger - zipps on camelback is my favourite zipps"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Zipp's, but this is my first time coming to this location and it's pretty horrible. First I stood by the door waiting to get sat down, all girls working the floor and bar, no one even cared to talk to me until I finally asked the bartender if I could get sat down. She states harshly \"It's open seating\". Well thank you!  2nd, After eating my salad for about 10 minutes the server came and dropped off my check saying \"No rush, but here's your check\". Okay, thank you again lol. This shouldn't even be done until I ask for the check like all places.  I was completely nice and always smiling, but apparently the girls here in Oldtown Scottsdale are very judgmental and not providing superior customer service.  The only nice person, the server that I had.  Will continue to go to other locations, but definitely not this one again.  Just letting y'all know if you decide to come here!  :)"}
{"text":"Went out to watch the play in game tonight for March madness.. the hometown team... Until the only table on one side of the restaurant requested the TV to watch the 8th seeded rangers in their regular season NHL game play the penguins and monopolize the TV.    Then after being ignored for the second half and a saddening ASU loss we requested to close out.... You think it would be over....   The server took 50 minutes to close out a table of 4 God forsaken people... 50 minutes...  I could've pleasured half the West coast in 50 minutes let alone give a table a check."}
{"text":"Some time has passed since the visit that caused the 1 star review, I have not returned but wanted to update and shorten this review to say if decent bar food at decent prices were the only factor for a good review, Zipp's would have it.  However, the experience with management the last time left a bad taste that just won't go away.  I may go back to a different location, but I don't think it's going to ever be the same frequency as before."}
{"text":"Good American cuisine & great beer at a reasonable price! Staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been a patron at zipps for a long time and at many different locations across the greater metropolitan area. This one on camelback I live nearby so I visit it most often. I am also a bartender for the last 7 years. CJ the bartender gives some of the worst customer service I've seen in a long time. I sit in the same bar stool and order the same thing every time I go in there. For one, he never recognizes me. I've probably been served by him half a dozen times in the last few months alone. Last time I was there, I ordered what I always do. After delivering my beer and food he never checked in to ask how the food was or if he could get me anything. I guess he forgot the two minute two bite rule, but there was only about 6 people at the bar. He was busy in conversation with the servers about restaurant problems. When I had finished my beer and my food, he just said,  \"Do you want your check yet?\" To which I was stunned. Usually you would ask if everything was ok, or if I could use a refill on my Budweiser. So I said, \"no..but I will take another beer and some to go food if thats ok with you.\" I took my new beer outside to smoke a cigarette. As I returned, my bar stool had been hijacked by someone who asked if someone was sitting there. CJ replied, \"Oh there was but he'll be fine.\" So I moved down three bar stools and waited for my to-go wings. I tipped about 22% but I was really pissed I did. So I feel this review is worth more than stiffing him on a tip, since he never recognizes me anyway.   I don't think I can go there to have beers anymore. They're lucky that the focaccia is freaking amazing and the wings are hands down the best in the state. I will say I have been served plenty of times at tables as well, both with friends and by myself, over the last 5 years i've been going to the camelback location, and I have always had pretty excellent service from all the girls. I think I'll just have to stick to getting to-go food from there or visit a different zipps."}
{"text":"Great specials throughout the day and on weekends. Very nice TV's and atmosphere. They run a tight and consistent ship. You won't be holding a table of 10 for an hour with only a few people present. The food is well above average for a bar and priced fairly and below the valley average, especially the happy hour pricing. 32 oz beer under $4, win!"}
{"text":"Always a great place for lunch.  Had Chili and wings today.  You can't go wrong with the burger, fries and rings either."}
{"text":"Excellent location, especially for MWU students. I go for the chicken skewers, zipparitas, and relaxed environment. Check it out .. Especially during their happy hour!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Zipp's I was promised the best chicken wings on the planet.  I was disappointed only by my inability to eat them all!  I can't do super-spicy, but the mild flavor is just right for me.  I haven't actually bothered to try anything else there.    As far as atmosphere, Zipp's is your usual sports bar.  I'm a fan of sports bars more than I am of sports, because I like to sit with a drink, some sort of food, and be able to talk to my friends without shouting.  That said, during a major sporting event, one would still need to shout to be heard properly.    I'm sure I'll go back!"}
{"text":"This can't be too common of a complaint, but if you're hanging out w/ foreigners, be aware they refuse to take passports as valid IDs (but also don't take foreign driver's licenses...so I guess they only serve Americans?)  Other than that, nice, cool chill place."}
{"text":"32 oz draft beer for $3.75. Need I say more? We couldn't have found a better place to watch opening weekend of the NFL.   Here's the low down: If you like sports, tasty food that's bad for you and cheap beer, Zipp's is your nirvana."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. Cheap beer, daily specials, and GREAT burgers. I was impressed! Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"The chicken was dead! Never alive just a horrible existence. Made me sad man. Chicken fingers were dry, didn't marinate them before being breaded I give them a 1/5. The fries were decent and could use some improvement and I give them a 3/5. Zipp's does make a good burger and only had one problem once, the burger was undercooked but I won't hold it against them too much so I give the burger a 4/5. The service is pretty good even when crowded they get the job done so a 4/5. Overall it's a nice place so I give them a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Always super busy when there's a game or fight-- food isn't bad, servers can be kind of rude but in a fun way.  I recommend coming here to watch a game, otherwise I don't know what the point is."}
{"text":"I ate here on Thursday, November 15 and got food poisoning from the wings. Let them know so they could pull the batch but they said it was just me and offered a free pint as compensation. I won't eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Cheap beer and the best wings in town...golden hot!"}
{"text":"I love Zipps for what it is - a sports bar with awesome food and drink specials - but I just can't justify giving them more than 3 stars.   I've been to Zipps dozens of times at a variety of locations around the valley, with the Camelback location being closest to my house currently. I like all the TVs and the large smoking patio (weeee!) and the CHEAP drinks. But they sometimes enforce weird drinking rules, i.e. only 3 of their frozen Zipparitas, or 3 big beers. If you're eating and hanging out for a few hours watching a game or playing shuffleboard three drinks isn't that much.   Also service is super spotty. Sometimes they're nice and enthusiastic, other times they disappear for seemingly hours on end and act inconvenienced when you ask for things like water or extra ranch?   Golden medium wings is where it's at. Trust me, try them. (Their hot wing sauce is HOT, by the way). The Fresca focaccia is my other favorite - chicken, salsa, sweet jalapeño sauce and pepper jack rolled up in a long narrow wrap. Yum. Both of these items can be ordered for $6 if you catch them on the right night, as Zipps has varying food and drink specials nightly."}
{"text":"I go to Zipps quite often and nothing has ever been an issue, but last night while trying to enjoy a nice outing with my friends/coworkers things took a turn for the worst. We had friends show up early to reserve a table for 8, we met up with them and sat down, ordered drinks, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. But then throughout the night, rude remarks and attitude was given by the server (not going to mention names because you know who you are) . You could tell she just clearly did not want to be there. The main issue occurred when the checks were brought to the table. Everything was unorganized. With ALL of us  at the table working in the restaurant industry (including our manager), we DO understand rough days and the business. But I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant. She then proceeded to drop the checks off... one check book had a salad on it, I recognized it was not ours and put it in the middle of the table.  We situated our money and she then came by to picked up our tabs. But before she could even do that...she snapped at our table saying we had some other tables check book, I said \"yes, we put it in the middle of our table because it wasn't ours\", she then says \"well where's the money that was in it\" we say there was none that we had seen. She then pulls aside the table that the check belonged to as they are exiting and questions if they paid their tab... they say \"yes, with cash\". She comes back to us (mind you making scene in front of the patio) saying it is \"impossible\" that there was no money in it, assuming we stole it. Coming from a table full of servers we discussed that we would never accuse a table and track back steps before throwing accusations around...well what do you know, the money was on the floor. How did the manager handle it? He simply stated he would talk to her. I have never felt so offended and appalled by how we were treated. It is called customer service. Not only did she do that, but as other guests would leave she would lean out the patio while they were walking to their cars asking if they paid their tabs. Just very unprofessional. She then brings back our checks but one booklet has three tabs in it and she says the cash amount given was insufficient because she forgot a tab... at this point I thought it was a joke. We all gave her enough money, but at this point I felt she wouldn't get a tip because clearly she did not deserve one and pocketed the money, with our manager fed up, he took care whatever needed to be paid for because he just wanted to get out of there. I have never tipped lower than 20% even if the service was bad, knowing that everyone has their days. But being accused of stealing while trying to enjoy a nice evening is uncalled for. Her demeanor was awful and the whole transaction had me sick. I will not be attending this Zipps in the near future."}
{"text":"I LOVE spicy wings and usually Hot is normal, but Hot here is REALLY hot.  It's the kind of hot that creeps on you too, so if you are as hungry as I was you may have wolfed down two-three wings before realizing you mouth is on fire!  But they tasted SOOOOO good I couldn't stop.  Zipp's loses a star for slow service on the water.  If you have someone order the hot wings an ice cold water should come automatically."}
{"text":"Love their patio area with the tvs--it's a great place to watch football. However in my world, football and beers go together like peas and carrots so when I can't get a beer, I get sad....and a little mad. We couldn't get the attention of our server for the life of us, not sure if she was just ditsy or in the weeds, but she was basically non existent the whole time.   The crowd was really funky for it being Scottsdale: a few normal people, a man dressed like a pirate and your standard douchey people dressed up to watch football on the patio in 100+ degree weather.   Food was decent I got the buffalo focaccia which had all the right flavor but kept falling apart.. Like Mexican food, it was actually better the day after. Parking is a beezy, I feel sorry for the poor people shopping at Sunflower since they have to share the lot with the place."}
{"text":"Super Bowl Sunday. I'm in a strange town and I want to watch the game. My indecision about where to go was quickly decided for me by my concierge who pointed me toward Zipps.   I got there with plenty of time to spare and was greeted at the door by the nicest guy who was very accommodating to make sure I had a seat. He offered me outdoors (too bright to see the TV's) , inside (the stool was higher than the table- not good for long periods of sitting) or at the bar (Perfect).   After getting though my Goldilocks phase, I settled in at the bar and got some great service from Shauna, the bartender who never lost her smile no matter how many directions she was being pulled in. In fact- she is the reason for the 4th star as she made me right at home at her bar from the first beer ordered. And there was none of that \"catering to the men\" thing that makes me nuts when the bartender is a cute female. She was on her game for all!   Plenty of TV's in this place.  Three alone over the bar, more outside and even more scattered through out the bar.  There is also a pool table and other bar games.  The food was just okay. I had a burger which came with a novel idea of half and half fries and onion rings. The food came up fast and hit the spot but it wasn't anything special. The fries were soggy and the onion rings were over done but the burger was pretty good with the meat seasoned perfectly. The menu is quite diverse, though, ranging from burgers to pizza to salads.   Nice clientele too. I had read some Yelp reviews about what kind of person frequents this place but I have to say- there was a good mix of tourists and locals and if the two guys sitting by me were any indication of people who normally frequent this place- I'd go back if I lived in the area (but maybe it was a different crowd given it was Superbowl Sunday) as they were friendly and fun to hang with for the afternoon.   Yay Zipps! You made my Super Bowl Sunday fun versus sitting at a hotel bar. And that's saying alot."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I liked it a lot - reminds me of the Irish bar I work in at home in So Cal. Mellow vibe and they had all the NFL games on this morning. Good drink specials - had the Bloody Mary with Titos for $4.50 and the cheese sticks - wrapped in won ton wrappers. Better than the usual breaded kind! Our receipt said our server was Angelica but I swear her name was different. In any case, she was awesome! We were there at 11am and she was attentive and nice. I would def come back here to watch some games and relax."}
{"text":"Worst service ever just went in there to watch cubs game waited 20 minutes asked 3 times to turn the game on  ...7th inning HELLLO you are not busy no one including some guy named MATT couldn't be bothered ....will never go in there again"}
{"text":"This particular location is getting one star for the following reason: I ordered medium wings and they gave me an order of hot. That wasn't a big deal. Accidents/human error happens. It was the way the MANAGER, of alllll people, handled it. I ordered my wings about 20 minutes before my cousins ordered theirs. As I took the first bite, I thought, \"Wow, these are really hot for medium,\" but I kept eating because I didn't know better. By my second wing, I'm sweating and thinking, \"These can't be their medium. They are way too hot to be medium.\".....so I ask my other cousin to try a wing. He agreed that they were extremely hot and that they must have accidentally given me hot. His sister and her husband dipped their finger in the sauce and were like, \"Whoa, you need to say something because they probably gave you hot by accident.\" By this point, 2 and a half wings had been eaten. Just before the MANAGER came to give us another order of wings (that my cousin ordered LONG after I ordered mine), my other cousin and her husband also tried the sauce. She said the medium didn't taste like mine. So....I asked the manager if I had an order of medium or did they accidentally give me hot. He looked at my wings for less than 2 seconds and said I have the medium. I said, \"Are you sure?\" He said yes in a very irritated voice. So I questioned again and asked him how he knew. He said that I didn't have a red toothpick.....so I pick up the red toothpick in my tray and say, \"This one?\"  After he saw, instead of taking blame, he said, \"Oh, then you must have ordered the hot.\" I said, \"No, I didn't order hot. I ordered medium. What happened?\" Again, he places blame on me and says, \"Oh, then you grabbed someone else's order at this table.\" He said it in such a way like he was not going to do anything about it because it was my mistake. During this whole time, I am remaining calm and being very polite. My cousin could not believe the way he was handling the situation with such an attitude so she gets involved and we all say that nobody at our table ordered hot. I couldn't hear what he said to my cousin, but I see him nodding his head no and shrugging his shoulders like, \"Sorry for ya\" kind of thing. That's when I ask for our waitress because she was very kind and I KNEW she would rememeber that I ordered medium, as she was the one who advised me to do so. Again, I can see him annoyed with me, as he's asking her what happened and he's just hoping she's going to prove me wrong.....except she doesn't. She tells him yes; I did order medium and that nobody at our table of 13 ordered hot, and that yes, it was Zipp's mistake. He was very unhappy to take the wings back and I could tell that he thought I was lying, and it was as if he thought I just wanted free wings. We still gave the waitress a good tip because it wasn't her fault that the manager was so awful, but we just couldn't believe that the manager was so, so rude. Besides that, the food was good and the spot was a good place to hang out and enjoy friends and family."}
{"text":"My first day getting to write reviews and I realized I haven't given anyone a 3-star and I'd like to round out my evening - so here's Zipps.   Good service (especially in Old Town), beergaritas, drinks, and food's ok. Nice patio to hang out on at night.   Warning to wing-eaters, if you ask for blue cheese, they'll just sprinkle some crumbles into some ranch, which is ridiculous and almost warrants a rant. But I had too many good times drinking there to hold it against them too much, so just don't get the wings and go for a focaccia instead.  Basically your typical 3-star, perfectly adequate."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want to just hang out with some friends and catch up, or watch some sports.  Their chicken nachos are yummy and a good side kick to your favorite beverage. :)"}
{"text":"I will write this for both the Camelback location and the one in Central Scottsdale.  If you're looking for a fun happy hour party (both regular and late-night), do the Camelback location in Old Town.  It's much more lively, there's a pool table, there's an awesome outdoor patio, there's a shuffleboard table, and the waitresses are awesome.  If you want something more for watching Sports and relaxing a bit, the Central Scottsdale location is the one for you.  Both are great.  Great food, great drinks, great service."}
{"text":"Giving it four stars based on the drink specials.  The nightly happy hour doesn't start until 8pm, and we got there about 15 minutes early. Lynne, our adorable server was nice enough to let us hang out with water until 8.  On a Friday night, it's \"The Most Interesting Night\" of the week, so there are Dos Equis Specials, Jager for $3, and whatnot. I did serious damage here for about $20. You can get massice 32oz beers for $4.  It's no different than any other sports bar. Come here with people you like. Don't bring a debbie downer, or a sober driver (but make sure you take a cab, so that everyone can have a good time). This is the place to kick back with your friends and have a few, and a few more.  The bar food is solid. I asked for a gigantic bowl of celery sticks, and she obliged. we got the golden wings (medium), not really sure what that meant, but it was amazing. Also I sampled someone else's fries, and they were epic.  A bite of the turkey burger....delicious.   The food here is probably not healthy, but that's why we have gym memberships, and muscles. To burn that shit off.   Next time, I'm doing an all Mexican friday. Dos Equis and Fish Tacos."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place two stars is because I think their food is good. The service at this place completely sucks except one waitress, but unfortunately I don't get her every time I'm their. My last trip here was the worst by far. The waitress took ten minutes to greet my friend and I then we asked for water with lemon and she didn't bring out the lemons. We asked her again and after ten minutes I just went to the bar to ask for them. Next she finally brought out our food, and we begin to eat and realize that the sandwich (the Monaco focaccia Cajun style is awesome!) didn't come out Cajun-style. When we asked her she said it was and just walked away. We have been there multiple times so we knew that she was wrong but didn't care, and we had to ask for silverware and napkins to eat with. Overall that was the worst zipps experience I've had.  It's too bad the service sucks here because I really do like the food."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed going to Zipp's for years.  The wings are friggin' amazing, they have some pretty nice beers on tap, and the staff is super friendly and cool to talk to.  The outdoor patio is great for large parties, love going there with a group after work to decompress and/or watch a Suns or D-Backs game.  5 Stars - All day long."}
{"text":"I luv Zipps for Happy Hour!! Yea Chicken Skewers and a 32oz beer! All that for less than ten bucks on happy hour is a steal, especially in this part of Old Town Scottsdale. Keep up the good work Zipps!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Zipps is the king of the local sports bars.  They've got decent bar food, great beer specials on Sundays, and I've always had attentive, friendly service.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Good food, especially for the price.  Servers were kind, though a bit loud in the restaurant"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and Zipps has never done me wrong.   Great place to go for games with multiple TVs and a lively crowd.   Also, they have Nightly Specials (food & drinks) from 8pm to Close everyday and the Golden wings are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great little sports bar just a couple blocks away. Large patio, lots of TV's. The pool and shuffleboard tables are a bit of a squeeze. The happy hour and reverse happy hour are very good and for can be a hit or miss. Usually the waitress will tell you if you as if something is good or not.... with an honest answer. This is a growing local chain and I've been to 3 of the locations which seem to be consistant."}
{"text":"Burgers are phenomenal... order one with \"half and half\" and get a generous portion of fries AND onion rings.   My favorite sports bar in old town."}
{"text":"First & last visit.  Came here on a recommendation from the college-aged kid cleaning my clubs at McCormick Ranch. We don't agree on what \"good beer lineup\" means.  The place is a bit of a dive. OK, I'm good with that, but it was a fairly run of the mill beer list.  Green chili burger was OK. Served on a grocery store bun. Fries were limp. The wife had a salad that wasn't bad, but nothing to brag about.  Cute young girls waiting tables and multiple TVs to keep track of March Madness.  Sorry, but my refined (old) taste calls for a bit more in the food & drink departments."}
{"text":"Please do something about the night manager Malcolm. He is very rude. I had my foot on the chair and he rudely came over and told me to take my foot off. No personality at all. Everyone else here is great and the golden wings are too!!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to say how many poor customer service experiences I have had here.  We used to do lunches a few times a week at my old job and Zipps seemed to be one of the regular spots, although I always made a fuss. Rather than being stuck in the office and miss out on the lunch gossip, I always opted to go, and EVERY time, it was the same old story...this place is never too busy during lunch, but service is slower than the second coming. It would take 1.5 - 2 hours for the small group of us to make it through lunch. Not to mention that after consuming my first beverage, the glass would remain empty, my number one dining pet peeve.   I do have to say that I can't completely hate on Zipps because their food really is good. They have awesome nachos and sandwhiches. I have never been disappointed with the quality of my food. And when I was having a calorie splurge day, Zipp's pizookie was the perfect way to do it!   Zipps gets a 2 star rating from me, but if they get their service act together, we can negotiate a better score..."}
{"text":"Badass burgers. THE BEST ONION RINGS. Nice patio (I think they even made a smoking section). A million TV's if that's your thing.  They have beers besides all american most people think they like."}
{"text":"Great for beers, sports, and greasy bar food. Very dark inside, but a massive patio with more sports. All in all a bit above average and a good neighborhood haunt.   Great for kids especially after a day of sports."}
{"text":"Our go-to place in old town. With so many options in the area, we always know what to expect... good service, great good, great drinks and extremely affordable. With insane daily specials, go now."}
{"text":"Popped into this place for late lunch at 3:00pm. Dining here I'm left with so many questions.   1. Why is the music so fucking loud? Are we at an EDM club in Las Vegas?  2. Why is there one server covering the whole place?  3. Why are the onion rings covered with so much batter? I feel like getting a Sawzall to chop them up.   4. Who in gods name chooses the music for this joint? It like pandora has a channel called \"Horrible music that makes you want to run into a moving bus\"  5.  Why is the music so loud?   6. Why is the music so shitty?  7. How is the food so basic and flavorless?  8. Why did I pick this place for lunch?  9. Will my co-worker ever forgive me for choosing this spot?"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for wings during happy hour. M-F, 3PM-7. $8 wings and $5 32 oz beers.   Simple wing sauce selection, though no need to stray from what they have. These wings have a great value at $8"}
{"text":"I love Zipps because of their amazing zipparitas, focaccias, and overall fun place. There are tvs everywhere so you always have a good view of the game you want to watch. The patio is fantastic on a nice evening in the summer."}
{"text":"This is the best chill out sports bar in town I've been here more times than I can count and it's always amazing. The best employee they ever had was and is Tim Rogers! He's the type of guy that makes a place like this special! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I frequent Zipps fairly often and I am definetly a fan.  No its not gourmet, super high quality food.  Its bar food people!  The burgers are great.  I know it sounds simple but their chicken fingers are the best.  Different from any others and the half onion ring/ half fry option with entrees makes me happy.  Plus they have some of the best specials and they last almost all night!  Theres only 1 hour in the evening that doesn't have specials (7-8).  I go here often with friends for beers, burgers, and sports. Loves it."}
{"text":"A must for us when we visit Scottsdale.  Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic. Very well priced and easy to bring the family, have some wings, burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank."}
{"text":"Everything you're looking for in a sports bar.  SEVERAL TVS- four over the bar, two in each of the downstairs areas, no problem changing channels to show multiple games at once NON-TV OPTIONS- pool tables and shuffle board available just in case your game sucks or you want a distraction for a few minutes AMPLE FOOD CHOICES- You're probably going to be disappointed if you opt for a salad, it just isn't their forte. They have daily specials, game day discounts, and also HH. It's typical bar food though, with fried apps, burgers, and pizzas. The Green Chicken Chile Rolls were fun but greasy, and didn't have much cheese. The sweet jalapeno dipping sauce was weird. Their \"foccacias\" are similar to cut pinwheel wrap sandwiches. The primo steak version was tasty, as were the fresh onion rings. FAIRLY FRIENDLY SERVICE- I was initially put off by another server's attitude, when we entered and she greeted us with, \"you seat yourself here.\" Not helpful when we aren't familiar with their layout and could only see that the entry level bar are was full. Luckily, Joy was our server and she was super sweet and attentive to make up for our awkward welcome."}
{"text":"We had lunch there last Wednesday and I know from another experiences with food poisoning that it takes a couple of days before it hits you I had a miserable weekend being extremely ill and I know it is because I had lunch on Wednesday at Zipps I was sick on Friday Saturday and Sunday I'm just now beginning to recuperate  I know it was the tuna salads - the place is not the place it used to be - the food was not as good - it was not clean or felt safe to eat - we should've left when I had those feelings but we didn't I should never have not had the tuna salad in a place like that - it did not even look good It was as much my fault as anyone for having eaten the food brought to me but the truth is that is where I got food poisoning and I was extremely ill all night on Saturday night and Sunday and it started with getting ill on Friday  I paid a high price for having lunch there on Wednesday"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. One of the best places to get HOT wings and I mean HOT! Every time I order the wait staff asks if I have had them before because many people cannot eat them! I can with a nice cold beer. The staff isn't all that bad as long as they are staffed. There are tons of TV's in the place but it is a small restaurant/bar. There is outdoor seating which is nice during certain times of the year."}
{"text":"Much Better food experience tonight. It seems there a few solid items at all Zipps and those are the ones worth eating each time.The focaccia is one of those items. This version had chicken breast, mozzarella cheese, onions and cherry peppers. It's about eight bucks served with good rings and mostly good fresh fries. The special beer prices at night have gone way up, by at least a buck, but still sorta feels like a deal. The other items at Zipps that are good are the pizza (pie only), cobb salad and zipparitas."}
{"text":"Had a great experience, luckily we found a table on a busy night with Arizona v UCLA. Service was impeccable and all drinks and food were decent. I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I went with a large party on Friday night and sat out on the patio. We had a server, Shelby, who was hard to find and friends who left throughout the night, and paid their parts of the tab, which she was supposed to take off the bill.   At the end of the evening, I was the DD waiting for our check and to take my friends home. Our friend Tim split up the bill with cards listed and amounts divided out for her. She was to charge my card 40 (which was well over what I owed and included tip) charge another couple for their tab plus more, which included their tip, and put the rest on our friends card.   Except that Tim's sister had given her 60 in cash when she left and it hadn't been taken off the bill. We reminded her of this and she was insistent that it had been taken off-- finally she seemed to \"remember\" she hadn't taken it off when all of Tim's sisters food and drinks were still on the tab.   When I got my bill, I marked 0 for tip, signed it, took my copy and drove everyone home. I checked my account and saw the 40 on my card. Come Tuesday morning, imagine my surprise when 80 DOLLARS is charged to my card from Zipps. Fuming, I called the store and talked to a manager, Brady, who took my information, told me he had to call Corporate and would call me back. Still waiting on the call back.   I was even more pissed when I found my copy of the receipt with the 0 marked in my wallet and confirmed that she decided to give herself an extra tip. Now I have to dispute it with my bank because she felt like being a scumbag. Really hoping my bank will refund me my money.   THANKS ZIPPS FOR THE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"We went there on a busy night. It is seat yourself and fight to the death for an open table. We finally found a table and there was only 2 chairs for 4 people. So whatever we borrowed some other chairs from else where. Ok. So the food.... Was great. However the service was shit. Slow, forgetting about our drinks, checks, etc for a while. I would recommend to eat here when it is not crowded, so maybe the service will be better.... Bc the food was delicious..."}
{"text":"Zipps is like McDonald's.. it will always be there and everything is always the same and you have nothing to worry about .... BUT things have changed !!   They have some strict rules & guidelines on food . Like if you prefer all drumsticks for your wing order , you will never get that . Not even for an extra charge . But the past few wing orders , the wing to drumstick ratio has not been correct and there were no apologies. I am sure there are many more rules of the menu that I am unaware of .  Yesterday was a complete joke with chambord margaritas. The GM was very defensive when we requested her to look a margarita ( for lack of chambord ) She calmed her bartenders have been over pouring and this is how it has to be . She went back and added a couple drops more .. but she was not happy . Myself and my party have been coming to all zipps locations for over 10 years . We know what the margaritas are suppose to look and taste like . And side note , she had the dirtiest shirt on .   So we are going to assume  , the liquor costs are up and this GM is trying to cut her cost and does not know how to do it . They are losing dollars over pennies !! Very Petty ! Reality check needed .  Oh and my friend wanted to add they do not have bud light on happy hour any longer at all Zipps  - and is not too happy ."}
{"text":"Great wings - it's what they're famous for. At least it's what I think they're famous for :) Happy hour make the dozen only $5  And they have a great outdoor bar, with several TV's, showing sports. If it's too hot, they'll turn on the mist system."}
{"text":"I have a hard time believing anyone can give Zipps less than 4 stars.  My friends and I come here often (sometimes more than once a week).  Great beer, great food, and usually the service is great.  They say the burgers are famous, but most of us prefer the wings.  Hot means hot, so order medium or mild unless you like eating habanero peppers."}
{"text":"Fun place on a Wednesday, yet laid back and relaxed. Mark took amazing care of us. The bartender on duty just didn't have the natural attentive abilities that I'm accustomed to.  He came off as he would do better in a Hebrew School then slinging drinks at a bar."}
{"text":"Don't cone here unless it's cj bartending. The weekend bartender has no clue. The gentleman I was with offered to buy me drinks all night . Alison the bartender has no clue will never be back when she is working . She waters down martinis."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for over a year for the fact it's convenient and we \"HAD GREAT\" service by a few bartenders and staff that are no longer there now. Decided to go on Friday evening at approximately 10:00PM after a long day of work and needed to grab a quick bite to eat with my fiancé and child. We waited about ten mins at a table and during this time it wasn't busy and we hadn't seen a manager on the floor or on the expo line like we would usually when we are in the restaurant. Finally a server walks up and tells us she can't serve us because they don't allow children after 10PM. We looked at our clock and it was a little after 10:15. My daughter was so hungry and had already picked out what she wanted to order so that was a big disappointment to hear for her.  There are a couple issues with this situation: 1.) Considering the situation I would think a manager would be on the floor to express an apology considering it would be a sensitive issue but there wasn't one to be seen. 2.) There isn't a sign posted anywhere in the facility saying that otherwise I wouldn't have brought my child. This was the first time I heard about this and like I said I been going there over a year. 3.) I searched on the Zipps website and there isn't anything stating that no children are allowed after a certain time. Furthermore, I attached a picture to show this sports grill is more of a \"family and friends neighborhood bar and grill.\" This location definitely showed in the scenario we encountered they do not stand by that motto."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Zipps but the staff at this location are simply dense. I was served the most disgusting salad once there. I simply told the waitress I didn't want it but I had no problem paying for it. The manager comes out and proceeds to ask me what my issue with the salad was. I said to him that it's not a big deal and I should have known better than to get a salad at Zipp's. He still wanted to know what was wrong with the salad. I told him it looked like a 4 year old made it and he could bring the chef out if he would like and I could show him how to make a salad... I left shortly after."}
{"text":"get the zipps wings, golden-medium hot. it's sweet, spicy, and comes out hot. that's all you really need to know.  okay, it's also a cool place to grab drinks with friends. their zipperitas are strong as balls. there's tvs everywhere and it gets packed for every game.   but really, get the zipps wings, golden-medium hot. I just moved to LA and I really, truly, deeply, miss zipps wings."}
{"text":"the best wings in town. go for the golden medium wings!  this is a great place to watch a game and get some good bar food. good nightly specials."}
{"text":"Not sure why all of a sudden they make the patio non-smoking. I thought maybe it was a corporate thing, but I know of a couple that still have smoking.  The real kicker is that it's non-smoking until 10pm. That makes no sense at all. Either commit or don't do it at all!  Been going here for years and considered myself a regular. Now we are committed regulars to Clancy's Irish Pub down the sidewalk."}
{"text":"We vacation in Scottsdale and the last 2 times we were there we went to Zipp's at least twice each week.  Everything we have eaten there was good.  Wings were very good...fries, burgers.  But the ABSOLUTE best thing on their menu is the brownie skillet dessert.  Fresh baked brownie on a skillet that comes out with ice cream, chocolae sause and whipped cream.  It is hands down the best dessert I have ever eaten, anywhere and trust me...I have tried many!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the opening weekend of spring training, and our group stopped in on Saturday for a couple snacks and drinks before heading to the Cubs opener. We ordered some nachos and and green chili chicken rolls, along with a few drinks. Everything was great. Service was a little slow but I think they just got hit early with some large groups from local little league teams, so no big deal there.  I'm not itching to go back, but I would highly recommend this place for some good bar eats, good drinks/beers, and watching some sports. We sat inside but it looked like they had a decent outside area with tv's and heaters for chilly weather."}
{"text":"For some reason I hadn't gone to this location yet, even though I am a big fan of sports, bar food, and drinks. I went this last Sunday with my roommate to watch some football. It was packed, but we were still able to get a table and our server was very friendly and accommodating even though you could tell she was busy. They have some of the best drink and food specials around and I love their patio area. I was only able to stay for a little over an hour, but I got their chicken fingers with fries. Although, they were only about average, I was still happy and will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I love riding bikes to Zipp's to watch sports with friends or to grab a beer before our kickball game! In my opinion, Zipp's has some of the best Blue Moon in the valley. I don't even know what makes it so good...it might be the SUPER juicy orange on the rim or the perfectly frosted glass, regardless, it always has me coming back for more! They also have fabulous HH Specials from 3 PM - 7 PM, Monday - Friday! {Mmmm, the wings-skewers with buffalo & ranch dipping sauces are my fav!) I must highlight that their ranch is amazing and i'm hard to please with ranch, so this is saying a lot! If you're looking for a fun place to get a cold beer, watch sports & indulge in some unhealthy {but oh so good} bar food with friends, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Count on Zipps for a good time, food is tasty at a fair price, plenty of TV's, attractive servers, burgers are sensational !!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the zipparitas here!! Used to come here allllll the time after work. $5 flavored frozen margs - strong & delicious! 4 stars because I've heard of multiple friends getting sick after eating here  I've never experienced personally but I've only had the chips  and guac here... would recommend sticking to drinks & basic snacks just to be safe!"}
{"text":"Wish one could do 0. The service here is horrible waited 45 minutes for food that was never put into the system, when asked to talk to a manager all he said was sorry..... Place is garbage"}
{"text":"Ok , and what about the whole tables awful food? I still have the receipt,if like a refund or something."}
{"text":"Can't say I go often or that I even go out to bars often but I like the vibe of this place. Usually busy (which for me is good because a depressing sports bar is well...depressing). They have a huge array of tvs, the patio area is nice and Camelback Rd although right next to it doesn't make it impossible to have a conversation with someone. Last time I went service can be spotty. Ordered a drink and we had to ask other waitresses twice for an update. I don't go to bars for amazing food and can't really speak for any of their dishes other than my go to one, but they do have in my opinion one of  (or at least my favorite burger) the best green chili burgers in town. Love it."}
{"text":"Arrived with some friends I have not seen in years. It was close to where they were staying. Younger 20's crowd. Beer was cold and my fish tacos where very good."}
{"text":"I have to preface this comment with the fact that I am now gluten-free and it is a struggle for me at times... But if I go without the bun and I skip the breaded fries, I really enjoy Zips.   THE GOOD: I want to give Zips a top rating because their food is awesome! The burgers there may be the best that I have ever had. I can't choose between the BBQ or the Southwest... And their fries are reminiscent of the memories I had for McDonald's as a kid... Zips has the best food any bar can hope for... Please - pay your cooks more money!  THE BAD: Zips will nickel and dime you for stupid things like mayo and ranch... It just seems silly that they will charge $.75 or a dollar if you ask for a side item... and they don't tell you until you get the bill... How Rude!   THE UGLY: Their wait staff always seems to be unhappy. They often seem over-worked and unable to give better service. Their attitude has changed my experience on more  than one occasion... and that is too bad because their food is really good."}
{"text":"So my friend told me this was the best sports bar in Scottsdale and I had to check it out so I figured I would go on Sunday to check out the games when I first arrive they have all the games playing on different TVs and they seat you based on what team you want to watch. The downside to this is if you are coming with a group only half of your table can watch one game and the other side of the table is watching another game which was annoying.   As for the food I was told there wings were amazing and hot so I ordered some hot wings only to find out they smell hotter than what they really are they were also pretty standard nothing amazing. I also ordered a green chile cheeseburger which was really good it was a pepper jack cheese burger with green chile from NM which made me feel at home. They also make homemade fries and onion rings which was a plus.   Overall there are better sports bars around, food is ok and nothing special would I go back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"I appreciate Zipps for its un-Scottsdale-like feel despite being right around the corner from the Old Town bar/club scene.  Zipps is a solid, down-to-earth place with many food, drink, and seating options, where you don't feel like you're being stared up and down.  Mad bonus points for allowing the option of half-and-half when you can't decide between fries and onion rings alongside your burger or sandwich.    I must deduct one star for the pizza-by-the-slice, which reminded me of the frozen pizza you buy at Costco, on account of the completely flavorless dry-ish crust.  Plus, the toppings literally slid right off, as though the pizza had been baked and then the toppings were sprinkled on as an afterthought (guess that's how they get away with selling pizza by the slice with any combination of toppings you can think of).  All in all, I do like Zipps and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a laid-back happy hour or night out.  Just stay away from the pizza."}
{"text":"Wife: Upon arriving here, we found that service was terrible.  However, they made up for this down fall with the deliciousness of their sweeter Golden style wings and onion rings.  The hubby might even say that my mood changed from the wicked witch of AZ to his usual  angel.  Hubs-  So I was dead set on Nellos but was told we were going to Zipps instead.  They serve wings......  They serve beer.....  So I was perfectly fine with change in dinner plans.    Walk into place and very lively crowd for a Wednesday evening.  Inside or outside seating is our first decision.  Easy!  Inside!  Baseball and NBA everywhere so great views.  Find a seat and eagerly await for someone to take our drink orders...2...4....6....8.....man I would appreciate someone to acknowledge us.  10 minutes before our waitress arrives.  So kind of agitated but beer is now coming!  Drinks took forever. At this rate I'm thinking we'd should of ordered breakfast.  Ordered wings and fries and was eager to post a crappy review on Yelp.   Then magic happened.  Our food finally arrived and it was outstanding!  We ordered the Sweet, Golden style wings and onion rings and loved the wings and rings.  I will say the staff was busy and maybe just short handed, but came away satisfied."}
{"text":"The wait staff is amazing. They had no problem with us moving once the early night crowd moved out. Patio fireplace! Amazing for the slightly cold nights. I really can't say how amazing our waitress was , she really was amazingly good.   This places is busy but not overly crowded like other Scottsdale bars so you can watch the game or talk with no trouble. The drinks & food were good. Totally would go back again!"}
{"text":"We love Zipps! Great food and service. Love Love Love the outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Ok so here's my deal with Zipps on Camelback. Been there 1000 times. They have a great great veggie burger. Like, super tasty. Can't emphasize enough. But the last time I was there I had a really bad experience. My well-vodka soda tasted like it was poured in a poisoned glass. It was beyond gross. Undrinkable. I tried. My buddy had a well vodka cran. Same exact thing. Something was off. So after trying to choke it down I complained. I said, it's not a big deal. DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT, but... it's gross. There is something wrong with something. So the fucking manager comes out and tells me that well vodka doesn't taste good. Thanks, Asshole. I drink well vodka ALL THE TIME and it doesn't taste like a chemical cocktail. So then he tells me that it comes out of his pay. Dude, are you serious right now? I just wanted a new fucking drink. Didn't want to enter psycho therapy with you. I'll pay for the drink. So now I don't want to go there anymore even though the food is really really good. Amazing. I'll probably go back but I hope the owner realizes his manager is Scottsdale's biggest tool."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went here for lunch. There was not many ppl inside so we did not expect to wait as long as we did for our food. The waitress we initially had seemed to have forgotten about us, even though again there weren't many ppl there.  She took our drink and food order and that was the last time she came over. She ended up passing our table over to another waitress but failed to tell us she was doing so, she never even gave us 1 update about our order. After sitting for a little over an half hour, we were finally asked if we were ok but of course at this point the answer was no and the question was where is our food? The new waitress was very nice and apologized for the experience we were having. She gave us updates and got our food out to us as fast as she could... she is the only reason I'm giving a 3. We all agreed it was a bad experience and wouldn't bother going back to this location, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here regularly for 7 years.  Zipps has some of the best beer specials in town and pretty good bar food.  The servers are top notch, and the patio is a chill place to chat with friends or people watch.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best nights for food: Tuesday for 6 dollar specialty burgers and Thursdays for foccacias.  The patio has heaters for chilly winter nights and misters for the summer.  There is a drawback though... As this location trains managers and servers for their new locations, you can have off nights."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour. Cheap beer, cheap pizza and shuffle board.  Best part was the SHUTTLE from the bar to Scottsdale stadium and BACK for only $5!!!   Then you can use that $5 voucher towards your bill later that day! What!?! Yeah we used that sucker all weekend!!!  The wait staff handled all 10 of our drunk bachelor party having asses with ease. It's like they have done it before."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about.. I love the golden wings and on a mod week slump like this I needed them... Highlight of my Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Food is ok and the beer selection is pretty typical for a sports bar. The chicken \"focaccia\" sandwiches are ok. They aren't made with the traditional Italian focaccia bread but rather more like a middle eastern flatbread or wrap.  Happy hour selections are pretty weak for food but the drinks aren't bad with $3 for 32oz on draft.  Inside bar and decor of this location is pretty depressing but the patio is large and can seat plenty.  Service   is  ok and haven't experienced any issues.    If you are looking for a place to watch  a big game this place will do."}
{"text":"Been there a few times place was very dirty and found cockroaches crawling right on the bar very disgusting management did nothing."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count. Its a great spot to meet up with friends for bar food and beer without spending a lot. Wings are good here. I like their golden sauce. It's on special most nights for $5 for a dozen. Even not on special they are reasonably priced. When I'm not in the mood to get my hands dirty, I'll usually get the chicken skewers or the chicken strips, with golden sauce to dip in of course. Also, they have good ranch and honey mustard here."}
{"text":"Decent American food and typical beer/alcohol selections. The happy hour prices seemed good. Typical sports bar. The seating is kind of strange, but there is patio seating (when it's not sizzling outside) and bar seating. There are a couple pool tables and table shuffle board. It's ok."}
{"text":"It goes something like this:  Me: Game tonight. Who's down? Friends: We're in, where? Me: Andrew wants wingy! And a big beer. Trying to keep it cheap tho.  Friends: So, Zipps?  Arguably the best happy hour in town (3-7pm). Zipp's has it made with awesome burgers and focaccias (really good wraps), and of course, those WINGS. Get them medium golden. The only downside is the lack of sauce variety, but the flavor and quality really outshine typical sports bar food. I've wasted many an evening watching games in this fine establishment. For good reason too - we're talking premium beers for $3 and 32 oz domestics for $4 or less. Toss in chips, salsa and guac for another $4 and you've got me as a fan for life!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Typical sports bar. It was unusually crowded on the patio and they had the sound on the tv and then music REALLY loud. We couldn't hear each other and the waitress couldn't hear us either. Asked for it to be turned down just a bit but they turned it up. Everyone on the patio was then trying to talk over it. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Do not go to this Zipps on a Saturday night. You have a good shot at getting towed! Whomever owns the property will have your car towed on Friday/Saturday nights if you park in the lot. I've been going to Zipps for years (N Scottsdale location) and I can assure you I will never go to the one in old town again after going there for dinner/drinks and getting towed in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"For a corner bar, its a winner!   Loved the hot wings and the patio beers.   Service was good, we had no issues, whilst I hear some reviews of issues on service, we had plenty of service.   The place is like a sports bar with a patio and a college bar vibe.   Its cool, very cozy for a date too and central scottsdale.    Enjoyed it, wings were BOMB DIGITY!   Bomb is great , superb!  Get some.   4 stars...recommended!"}
{"text":"Zipp's is absolutely heat. They have incredible wings and I highly recommend the Golden Medium sauce. Pepper Jack Focaccia is really good. Their fries are a little hit and miss but they make up for with huge 40oz frosty mugs of delicious beers. Love coming here during football season or for any sporting event on TV for that matter. They have TVs all over. If you're craving wings you gotta stop in."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Zipp's location and this is my favorite location to sit outside on the patio. If you like sports and bar food, then my friend, you have found your place. Lots of TV's, lots of beer (heck yes, I'll take the 32 oz one, duh!), and wings! Their golden style wings are so incredibly delicious that when I'm watching sports at home, I'm wishing I had a dozen of Zipps wings in front of me!"}
{"text":"My husband & I have been going to one Zipp's or another around town for the last 7 years...we currently live near the Old Town location...always our 'go to' place to eat during the week when we don't feel like fixing dinner at home. It's your typical sports bar with a bit better food selection. You can't find a big 32oz beer for $4 ($3.50 @ happy hour) anywhere around town & their onion rings are outstanding, you can order 1/2 & 1/2 ...fries & onion rings with your burger or sandwich. We have never had an issue with the wait staff at any of the 3 different locations we have visited. The new boneless buffalo chicken skewers are fabulous & on special when regular wings are.  Happy Hour M-F 3-7pm $5 Wings & other stuff  Plus nightly specials 8pm-close & Weekend specials 11a-4p We love Zipp's!!"}
{"text":"The reason we actually came here for the evening was because every other bar nearby wasn't playing sound on the NHL Stanley Cup game which was highly aggravating, but Zipps was playing the sound with the game thankfully! As long as you continue to do that I will continue coming for all the playoff games (thank you)!! This location is awesome! Staff was super friendly- AND they have Sam '76 on draft!!!!!! I was pumped for that! Wings were definitely good (not grilled unfortunately, so certainly not a favorite) and they gave us two sides of ranch (for each of our order of the wings) which was nice. Chicken skewers looked good, but I didn't try them."}
{"text":"So I came here this past Sunday with my boyfriend, his sister, and 3 other friends for a business meeting and it was awesome! I didn't know what to have cause I wanted to try something new but one of the friends with me recommended angry orchard cause he knew I wanted a beer but wanted something new. It was so yummy. It was an apple cider beer. And our waitress was nice. My boyfriend and I however, did not pay attention when the waitress told his sister not to get hot wings because their hot wings are really hot. We got one basket of that and one of the golden ones. The golden ones were really good. But the hot ones were so hot that we couldn't even taste anything or enjoy it. And let me tell you, I'm not a sissy when it comes to spicy foods but man was it in enjoyable so if you can handle spicy like me, I don't recommend that because you can't enjoy it. So my recommendation is to get mild or medium or ask for a sauce thing to see if you can handle it. Oh and any extra sauces cost extra so just be careful."}
{"text":"Yes, I'll say it. This is as good as it gets...  .... ..... for a sports bar.  I am in love with their golden sauces.  Mmmmmmmmmmm. I also love their focaccia sandwiches, wings, and chicken fingers.  So when I'm craving greasy, bad for me, bar food.  This is my first place of choice. Yum."}
{"text":"Big beers make me happy.  Turkey Chili makes the wife happy.  Patio is cool, had TV's.  Fills up on big game days.  Dont remember what else..."}
{"text":"Oh I'm totally crazy about Zipps.  Its a great place to watch the game, grab some grub for happy hour, or day drink outside on Sundays.    For happy hour, they have different deals every day, inclduing both drink and food items.  A personal favorite is the monaco foccacia--a chicken, cheese and ranch foccacia wrap with a mild jalapeno sauce on the side.  With fries and/or onion rings, this is the perfect hangover meal.    We used to frequent Zipps on Sundays when you can get a bucket of beer for $10 (5 Bud Lights, what a steal), sit outside, watch football and play cards.  Fine, we're nerds, but I'm telling you, its the perfect ending to a weekend of debauchery.    Theres a ton of TVs (although not as big as some other bars) and service is good.  On game day, arrive early to be able to seat your whole party--or for those who want a more hands-on sports experience, try out the 2 shuffle board and pool tables.    Morning, afternoon or night, Zipps is a great place."}
{"text":"Worst tortilla soup I have ever it tasted it was like a hot bowl of salsa plain and simple. If I would have been given chips I may have eaten it. The server was really cute and attentive but she had no clue what to suggest for a non meat eater I was struggling to find anything appealling here. She finally suggested a salad. It was good it had candied walnuts and dried cranberries w goat cheese on it but by the time I got it everyone had eaten and I stole a bunch of their fries so I couldnt eat the whole colassal salad. I just read Dallas' review I wish the girl would have suggested their veg burger sad. I might go back if I had to. I used to live at Zipps years ago but mainly for the football and booze not the food meh."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a sports bar through and through. I came here with some buddies on a Sunday after a bachelor party the night before. We were sitting outside but then it started raining - so we headed inside and the only \"table\" available was the pool table in the back which was converted into a dining table. Not very comfortable but it was a table (sort of).  The food was delicious - we ordered several appetizers, a pizza and sandwiches, along with a couple pitchers of beer. I was stoked that they had New Belgium Ranger IPA on tap!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. We sat on the patio had a couple drinks and some wings. They were great. The wings were a decent size and the sauce was tasty. Our server was fast and friendly. When I mentioned my food allergy she was happy to go back into the kitchen and double check for me, which I greatly appreciated. Solid sports bar in old town. Big drinks, good bar food, good service, what's not to love."}
{"text":"It's Zipps. A chain restaurant that has the same feel wherever you go. Not as big as the one in Arcadia. The wings are always great. The pizza is comparable to the take-n-bake that you can pick up at your local grocery store."}
{"text":"Specials everyday of the week, outdoor seating and cheap drinks. Zipps is definitely an old town favorite and for good reason.  The prices are great and the drinks are always cold. Be ware of the famous zipparita! This location is perfect for sporting events and has enough tvs to get the job done.   During special events they also get the Zipps bus rolling making it even easier to stop by and enjoy yourself.  Writing the review makes me want to grab a foccacia now..."}
{"text":"Went to Zipps the other afternoon for some lunch, have eaten at this place before, and could not remember why it had been so long since I had eaten there again...  Oh yea, this is where most of the white trash southern redneck big truck driving cheap ass hillbillies hang out at plus the food always gives me a stomach ache because it is covered in grease.  Got the mushroom Swiss burger with fries...that were literally shimmering from the grease on them, and got the brownie skillet...for desert and could not believe this was 7 bucks was a total rip off of Organo's Baked Cookie. Our bill was over $33 bucks with only two Zipparita's a little high for bar food.  This place got 2 stars for these reasons alone.  1. It's Cheap 2. The service was excellent it had a ton of waitress so there was never a wait. 3. $3.00 happy hour Zipparitas  were good and were very strong.  Also this place is not an atmosphere for kids...so white trash muffin toppers please leave your 4 year old at home, instead of letting him mingle between tables while you slurp up giant mugs of beer with your tattooed roller derby girlfriend and her toothless hillbilly inbred that can only grow facial hair on certain parts of his face boyfriend."}
{"text":"Visited Scottsdale this weekend and was directed, by a local, to try Zips as a good sportsbar that would be close to our hotel.  Nursing a killer hangover from the night before, I ordered  a Coke to begin with.   The Coke tasted like they have moldy lines or something.   A couple other guys I was with ordered Mr. Pibb and each of their drinks had the same \"musty\" taste as well.  I had the jalepeno burger and fries and they were both pretty good.  Nothing out of this world, but decent.  The service was terrible.  Actual exchange between my friend and the waitress:  friend: I'll have the Caesar salad. waitress: chicken caesar salad? friend: No, just a regular caesar salad. waitress: what kind of dressing do you want with that? friend: I'll have the ranch (ok he didn't actually say this part, but i wish he would have)  it's a freakin' CAESAR SALAD! Without the caesar dressing it's just a salad.    Food was OK. Service was...curious.  Beverages were bad."}
{"text":"They have very nice wings, and a very cheap pool table. Nice patio to sit. Service is fast. They also have cheap beer specially at happy hour Wifi usually doesnt work. Very noisy,"}
{"text":"I am adding a star because they have great happy hour during the week, amazing daily specials for food and drinks and they have a wide variety of food and booze options. Recently I tried their Chicken salad with goat cheese and cranberries and I must say it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok so i had a salad.  Not the best but why would order a salad when their burgers with jalapeno sauce are so darn good.  Well all I had been doing while on a little trip there was eat.  i was just not hungry.    We actually met about 18 of my sons' friends for dinner there.  So the company was already great.  Our server was excellent and all in all it made for one happy night.  I know I will go back next time I am in town.  I promise to have a burger and fries.  I wish it was here in my town because right about now a burger sounds pretty darn yummy.    Till the next time."}
{"text":"Mediocre chain in the Phoenix area. Service is ok. Food is marginal sans the chicken wings. The wings are out of this world."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go to this Zipps regularly because it's really close to work! The happy hour deals are great!  The food is great as well. I've tried many things on their menu and always been satisfied, but their fish sandwich, and the golden mild wings are AWESOME!!   As regulars, we find the waitresses very friendly! They always help us get a table when it's busy and recognize us each time we're there. I've never had a problem with the service or management.  No complaints here - Zipps is the best!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food at Zipps but the last time I ate there the quality seemed less than usual.  The burger was not as fresh, the onion rings tasted like they had been sitting for a while.  Soda was flat, had to ask for a new cup and they did get me a better soda, but just another indication that things are slipping.  What I do like there is the Black and Blue burger with one patty, two patties and I am just stuffed.  My wife really likes the Monaco wrap.  Other than this last experience, the food across the menu is generally very good."}
{"text":"This is a PERFECT location to come to whether you are watching any sporting event, getting happy hour after work, or needing a few drinks before a night on the town. Their Zipperita's are fantastic (not to mention, strong!). I am partial to their wonton cheese sticks, wings, and pizza. Everyone is always so nice there and helpful."}
{"text":"Love the Golden Hot and Extra Hot wings...some of the best in town!!"}
{"text":"our second stop for the san tan beer labor day pub ride. zipps always seems like such a fun place. alas, we don't eat meat anymore, so why go?   the wait staff was super cool with a bunch of dorky bike riders pulling up. they kept the booze flowing and didn't seem stressed at all. the patio was freaky hot though.   i hear from my friends...they always love zipps as a good ol standby for beers and watching sports!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to watch a college football game and figured that Zipp's was as good a place as any to watch it.  Arriving around noon, we found several televisions that we were able to change to our game.  We also learned that there was a special happy hour available even on Sundays where we were able to order a full 18 inch pizza for only $10.  In fact, there is a great menu with both happy hour and reverse happy hour deals for drinks and food.    Though the pizza was a great deal, the pizza was not the best.  The service, on the other hand, was very good.  The waitress stopped by every few minutes to check on us.  I probably won't order the pizza again, but I'll definitely come back another day to enjoy the sports atmosphere and perhaps order a specialty burger or wings.  There are also several Zipp's around the city, which are in pretty convenient locations.  I have had positive experiences at all of them."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place to meet up with someone and grab a drink.  Caught up with my cousin here and watched a Sunday Night Football game a few weeks ago. Pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Zipp's is apparently a somewhat local chain that I'd never heard of until my most recent visit to the valley. Frankly? It was about as good as a subpar chain that I'd never heard of. I don't often recommend that classic chains over more local spots, but after a visit to Zipp's I'll argue that it's beat out by Hooters, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc. I've experienced better.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  The atmosphere at Zipp's is just fine, with a large selection of seating complimented by pool and shuffleboard, which was great for my party of twelve during our quest to find a good spot to watch some March Madness. The waitstaff, while not exactly quick or attentive, were offset by food that came out quickly, which I can always appreciate. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Another area where I can't really complain. A pitcher of decent beer? $10. An order of maybe 12-15 wings? $8. Sure, it's not the bees knees, but these were some fair prices that beat out what I would have found at Hooters, etc. Burgers, sandwiches and the like hovered around $10, which is fair enough. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  It's here where things were just a little bit off. I was told before coming to Zipp's that there are two things that everyone should get: their wings and their foccacia. My party got both, and topped it all off with some fries, having ordered both their buffalo and 'golden' wings.   The wings were okay, and were surprisingly meaty, but I couldn't honestly spot the difference between the buffalo and the golden. Apparently the golden are supposed to have more of a bbq taste to them, but to me they just tasted like standard wings. Fair enough.  The foccacia, on the other hand, was very disappointing. Buffalo fillings were essentially just poor buffalo chicken, and the bread itself was nothing to write home about and ended up being quite a bit undercooked in my opinion. The fries? Awful, with very little flavor and a texture that can be defined as nothing short of soggy. All in all, not a great food experience. No Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Again, in my opinion Zipp's is trumped by Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings, but it's a decent alternative with a lower price point. Even so, No Star Granted here. There are simply better options around the city."}
{"text":"Service is great, but food is blah. I got the tacos and it looked like a blind person took a bunch of ingredients and threw it on my plate. No presentation or care. I guess you go here for the atmosphere more than actual dining experience."}
{"text":"there's nothing bad to say about zipps.  always a good burger that isn't going to cost you $12-$15 - like at the yardhouse or other place in old town.  great fries.  lots of tv's.  great place to slide in, grab a burger and a beer or three, and slide right out."}
{"text":"This place is nasty with bland, basic food and now its grossness is well documented:  https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodInspection?p=FD-05504&i=4076561  \"Observed cook employee handle raw hamburger patties, then wiped his nose and then proceeded to make customer order.\"  Nice.  Hopefully something good goes in its place."}
{"text":"Seat yourself restaurants, especially sports bars during large sporting events like March Madness, make me uncomfortable. I hate hawking tables waiting for people to leave so I can jump in the booth while they are bussing the table.   After 8+ hours of watching March Madness at home on Saturday, my husband and I decided to venture up to Zipps in Scottsdale to catch the second half of the last games of the day. Luckily despite the crowd and having to seat yourself, we got a table within five minutes or so of arriving. Our waitress was very nice and even when she got my order wrong, she fixed it quickly and apologized for it.  We had the chicken nachos which I didn't care for too much because they use shredded chicken and I prefer the pieces of chicken meat. My husband had a slice of pepperoni pizza (described as just OK by him) and I had the chicken caesar foccacia with half onion rings (for my husband) and half french fries.  If the menu hadn't said my sandwich was supposed to be on foccacia, I would have never guessed. It came out as a wrap cut in five pieces and it was almost impossible to eat as everything kept falling out.  The onion rings and fries were forgettable...supposedly the fries are fresh cut, but I didn't get that sense.  Thankfully prices are incredibly moderate and for our food and 2 32 oz domestic drafts ($4 after 8 on Saturdays), our bill came to $29 without tip.  It looks like Zipps has a pretty decent happy hour and also runs nightly specials after 8 pm.  There are TVs throughtout the inside and on the patio, so it is a good place to catch sports...they had two different college games on that we could see plus the Suns game. I will go back to drink some beer, watch sports, and play shuffleboard (or shufflepuck as it is called in Ohio), but not for the food."}
{"text":"The server was nice. I was excited to return and have a second round of the Chicken Foccasia wrap. Well, it wasn't nearly as good this time. Half of it was dry, as the sauce seemed to be sloppily distributed, the way I might expect a burrito at Taco Bell. Come to find out, it wasn't even the same thing I'd ordered last time. According to the waitress, there are a few different types of this dish. A piece of information that would have been useful when ordering, and without myself knowing this, how did they know which one I wanted then? I'm glad it was as good as it was the first time or I'd never return to try this item again. Now that I know this item comes in different varieties, I'll probably visit again sometime and make sure I order the correct one."}
{"text":"I love Zipp's, always have and probably always will.  It's a relaxed sports bar with decent bar food.  My friends always get the hot wings so I take that as a sign of delicious-ness!  I myself am a huge fan of the focaccia, I think it's their best seller so check it out!  The patio is excellent for beer drinking and hanging with friends.  The servers are pleasant and always some-what quick.    I highly suggest this place for a relaxed lunch or HH."}
{"text":"I just left and am disgusted! I was sitting at the bar and a baby roach crawled across the bar. I trapped it with the glass and told the bartender. She tried to get it and it went in the bar mat. She was very nice and I was not loud about it. However I was with 7 people and we literally were about to order food. She did discount the tab. Which I could care less about, I tipped her 100% because it's not her fault...but this was unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Great service all of the time.  Good food and great happy hour deals.  Good place to go anytime.  They have all sporting events on DirecTV and will change the TV at request.  Great place to go."}
{"text":"All three stars in my rating are for the service... our waitress (Megan) was excellent today at lunch.  She was speedy, attentive, and sincere.  We had a large group for lunch and it was fine... just fine.  Needless to say, I didn't love the chopped chicken bbq ranch salad that I ordered.  I guess next time I should go with a burger and fries or onion rings.  The chips and salsa were decent.    I would go to Zipp's only if your intention is to watch a game and not for the food!"}
{"text":"Terrible wings Cheap and overpriced nachos Zero Customer Service..  Everyone keeps telling me how amazing the wings are. So far I have ordered 3 times (mostly in desperation because Long Wongs was closed) and all 3 times I have been disappointed.  1. I always ask for the wings to be done extra, extra crispy. -What I get is regular wings. Nothing crispy about them.  2. I always ask for extra ranch and extra bluecheese dressing. - I never get extra  3. I ordered the nachos. This picture says it all: Click For Pic of Zipps Nasty Nachos  https://tinyurl.com/ycoj68s6  Not sure how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations when it comes to Zipps, however even for a sports bar this place is kinda gross.  We used to come to Zipps a lot due to good happy hour prices, they have since raised the prices and now it's very difficult to recommend a place that looks the other way in many regards AND isn't very cheap.  First, it's probably not a bad idea to wash your hands after handling a menu anywhere, but wow their menus are dirty. The last two times I have been here my hands were sticky after touching them. Including the last time where I tried hard to only touch it with one finger. The table was only slightly cleaner.  Then the most egregious part of our visit, the tacos. I'll preface with saying that I am far from a taco snob. I enjoy anything from Taco Bell, Del Taco, Salty Señorita, etc. Wow, Zipps has the worst tacos I have ever eaten. You get four tacos, seasoned beef or chicken. I got 2 each.  The chicken and beef meats look almost identical and basically taste the same.  I should have taken a picture. Both are soupy messes that taste like what I imagine what dog food taste like. I hated typing those words because it sounds mean and sensationalizing, but it's true. The corn tortillas buckled under the load of the soupy, gross mixture that tasted like it's been sitting in a soup container waiting to be delivered to a poor unfortunate soul.  The tacos come with sour cream (which I luckily got on the side) and diced tomatoes which added to the mushy mess.  There was no cheese, lettuce or anything else on the tacos. But I did find large pieces of lettuce UNDER the tacos in the basket. Likely from a salad mix.  Luckily we got sweet potato chips which did offer texture and a pleasant taste."}
{"text":"This place was awful and dirty. I'm from out of town and we came here because it was convenient. The tables are filled with gunk between the cracks. Stick a knife in there.. if you can.. our server took for ever to come around to us. I saw the other tables servers around many times more than I saw our table then I gave my server cash and she didn't even give me my change back ( yes it was going to go back into her tip anyways) but seriously not even giving it back to me??? I only had two drinks and would've at least tipped 5.  I'm a server myself so I generally over tip but I just couldn't at this place and with this experience."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in thos zipps location, came here for lunch at 11 AM and it was very calm so you think I wpuld have a great quick meal at the bar.. It took 30 minutes to get my one Fresca foccicia and when I finally did the sweet jalapeño sauce was just mayo. When I asked the lady she said that's just how they must've prepared it today. I love zipps food usually but this one is just definitely subpar."}
{"text":"This establishment is NOT pet friendly! General Manager Susan refused us patio service. How does this happen in pet friendly Old Town? Luckily Clancy's took this face in."}
{"text":"\"Anyone going to Zipp's intending a culinary masterpiece deserves what they get, and thats likely a sad little Scottsdale frown.  One should go to Zipp's because of their kickass patio, complete with a fire pit and TVs at every imaginable angle in which to view games -- even if you are the last in your party to arrive and get stuck with the worst seat at your table.    The managers are always willing to switch it to the game you're interested in as well and don't give you the same kind of haughty shit that other sports bar managers do when you ask them to alter their precious programming schedule.  The food is good, for bar food of course, although i don't venture out very far past their Hot Wings.  They have really good beer on tap too -- nothing else quite like a 32oz. Alaskan Amber and some college basketball.  I would have to say that, as an avid sports fan who really tries to avoid watching important sporting events outside of my comfort zone (re: living room), Zipp's is the only place I will let host my antics.\""}
{"text":"Oh Zipps.  Oh Zipps,  Oh Zipps.  I do like you today.  Last time I hated you. The time before, I loved you.  First of all, you are so dark inside.  And sometimes you are dirty; yet sometimes, you're freshly cleaned!  Your service is consistently outstanding, when it doesn't suck.  Your patio is delightful, when it isn't crowded and awful.  Your fries are marginal; yet your sweet potato chips are delightful.  First time today with your onion rings, that are quite tasty I must say!  I just wish I liked onion rings.  Your sweet jalapeno burger is always a crowd pleaser, and today was no exception.  The secret sauce is so delicious, I want to bathe in it, and put it on everything.  Dear Zipps, you always manage to attract the most interesting crowd - businessmen to sports enthusiasts; douchebags to posers; teens to senior citizens.  Parking is always easy; and there is always a timely sporting event to watch.  I don't want to see in your kitchen; but the food always comes out quickly.  Your salads are fresh; and appetizers are tasty.  Most notable - your happy hour is ALWAYS exceptional, and beers are always cold, and large.    Oh Zipps.  Oh Zipps,  Oh Zipps.  I do like you today."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Zipp's.  It is close to home and CJ is the best bartender. Come a couple of times and he has your name down. The tacos on Wednesday night are great! $4 for 4. I like the chicken. The wings are awesome here. My nephews always ask me to take them here! A huge 32oz draft at happy hour will make you happy for sure! On Wednesday night the flavored Zipparitas will knock you on your a....! Watch out! That's why they limit to 3!"}
{"text":"Ok so the service isn't always the best, but I love this place.   I sit outside every time I come here and they have refreshing misters in place so you wont melt:)  They serve Blue Moon and have a great happy hour. The food is yummy too.  I come here everytime I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food here is always not the way you ordered it. Also the waitress and managers will give you attitude if you ask for it the way you ordered it. Came to watch sports and have a beer you might be ok but the glasses taste like cleaner. Sports bar quality is was it is but this location is the worst!"}
{"text":"Wow... My friend asked for a Cabernet 4 different times to 2 different servers an it took over 35 minutes even after they discussed the wine list to him.. Then she finally came to the table an said your cabs here.... We were like where? This server thought we meant a cab like in a ride... The foods good but the servers are terrible."}
{"text":"Gotta get the hot wings! They'll make sure you know what you're getting into, but even if you haven't had them before, just play along. They're worth it."}
{"text":"I don't go to bars often anymore and probably wouldn't have gone to Zipp's had Sushi J been open for dinner when we arrived. I found Zipp's too dark inside (one of the reasons I don't go to bars often) and would have asked to sit outside had it not been so warm and humid out. Is there an outdoor area? I don't know and didn't ask. I ordered the passion tea and didn't like it. Yuck. It tasted like...I'm not sure.....dishwater?"}
{"text":"Zipps is my favorite place to watch a game, get a beer especially during football season.  I recommend the medium golden wings and a 32oz domestic.  They have the best happy hour and daily specials around."}
{"text":"Could I give this place NO STARS???  My girlfriend and I head in and sit down with a group of friends already there. We smile and wave at the waitress to let her know more people joined and she purposely makes us wait at least 10 minutes.  I am not a fan already... but yes, it gets worse, people. She brings our drinks out after another table sits down and orders theirs. Our friends are catching on and order a round. Get them before ours. Gosh, does she discriminate against blondes?? I am wondering. Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings. Didn't get it.  At this point I go up to the manager and ask if the gal is super busy tonight or if something is up in the kitchen. No, and no. I tell him what's going on and he tells me he'll come out in a moment.  Oh... that moment was priceless. He actually said we were rude to her and should be lucky she even continued to serve us. He must be screwing her so I am OUT OF THERE! My tip to folks. Sit at the bar if you must go. There are plenty of other spots out there that will treat you wayyyyyyyy better, have better service, food and prices."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I do not recommend this place to anyone. They ruined our 21st birthday celebration. We paid the complete bill (which took about 30 min to because they would not split the check even after the manager himself said he would take separate cards) and once we all walked out everyone took off and the manager runs out and says that our bill was short $30.00. It was not short and he should check his cameras because someone took that money... We know that they took the tip out of the bill. We would have left a pretty good tip if we weren't treated the way they treated us that night. The manager is very RUDE and needs to learn about customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect if you want a chill night or pregame before old town. They have a few games too which is nice to do besides just sit there. Always a non threatening atmosphere and have seen dogs on the patio which i love!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for drinks and food. Great atmosphere and they have amazing chicken wings."}
{"text":"My experience was similar to the other recent posts.  We stopped in on Sunday for lunch.  We first sat at the bar.  I had a drink within 5 minutes.  We then spent the next 30 minutes trying to order food.  The bartender was busy taking phone calls and was the only person available.  We moved to a table, but then it took another 15 minutes to get someone's attention.  In hindsight, we shouldn't have taken the menus to the table.    The food was great, but I didn't expect to spend 2 hours eating lunch."}
{"text":"Place is a decent place to go if your plan is to watch a game and have a drink. Food selection/price was a joke. I ordered a chicken salad. I asked the waitress how much a side of chicken would be and how much I would get. I was told 6oz for $5. Which was acceptable. What I received was a couple pieces of cubed chicken on the salad and maybe 3oz on the side. I politely addressed the manager and he insisted the little bit of chicken I received was 6oz. Well, I know what 6oz of cooked chicken looks like. The manager could've remedied the situation very easily. Yet he insusted. So I asked him to take the chicken away. Terrible customer service. So instead of fixing the issue, he'd rather remain insistent, and lose out on the $5.00 charge AND the chicken. Good job in not turning a profit or pleasing your customer.  Nice ambience to watch a game and have a drink. Don't come here expecting a decent portioned meal for a decent price."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about Zipp's. Admittedly, their happy hour is good but it's almost like a couple hours of fair prices to make up for the other 18 hours a day of unfair prices. Not unfair in the outrageous sense, just slightly inflated when you're dealing with food that average at best.   It's a fun place to go in a huge group and pass around pitchers but not necessarily the best around. I would be more inclined to patronize Dos Gringos or a true dive to delve into those sorts of hijinks.   Zipp's not-so-comfortably straddles the line between pure sports bar and Scottsdale scene, since so many pre-partiers stop by in their clubbin threads on the way to Axis or Pussycat Lounge or wherever.   I have a theory that in the right group, any place can be a five star find, and I still believe it. Keep that in mind when you head towards Zipp's."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. We arrived at 1:05 PM. Waitress came and asked us what we wanted to drink, took 15 - 20 minutes to get the drinks. She then took our order which was a Philly Focaccia split for two with french fries and a Greek salad with grilled chicken. At 2:06 we got our lunch. A chicken Focaccia and a Greek salad without the chicken. By the time we finished eating we were there 13/4 hours. I must say that the waitress apologized for all the problems and did not charge us for the drinks. I have been to this restaurant many times and have never experienced this problem, that is the reason this did not get one star. By the way there food is very good for a reasonable price. I do recommend this restaurant, but if this should happen to you do not be so patient. I did tip the waitress 20% because that is the way she makes a living."}
{"text":"Wish they would swap out the sweet potato chips for sweet potato fries, but what can you do?  Zipps is a weekly staple in my household.  Happy hour just isn't complete without an ice cold 32 ounce mug of beer from Zipp's.  The BBQ chicken sandwich is awesome.  My new favorite is the Balsamic Chicken Salad.  You'd never expect to find such a lush green and very tasty salad at a sports bar.  Prices are impressive and the staff is always friendly.  Seating can be tricky in the evenings or on the weekend, so it's best to get there early to beat the crowds.  Again, my only complaint is the lack of sweet potato fries.  Who eats those chips anyway?"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery."}
{"text":"Pretty decent as sports bars go.    I got to spend about six delightful hours on a great college football Saturday afternoon recently. What made it delightful?  First..our servers, Sheila and then her replacement Bridgette (who had some real nerve sporting the U of A shirt) and second the overall quality of this location....and lastly, Ohio State lost.  While the general consensus from our party (which was an ever-changing 8-9 people anchored by yours truly and a Chris V.) was that this location is smaller than the others but still roomy enough to get loads of people to watch the games w/ unobstructed views.  Tip: if coming w/ a big party to this location you better get there early.    The menu is typical bar grub so read not healthy what-so-ever.  Fried Chicken Salad?  Really?  You're not even trying to fool me to think its healthy.  It's not bad nor great...fills ya up so you don't get too trashed.  It is worth noting...our service was downright amazing.  Sheila and Bridgette were busier that one legged men in a butt kicking contest but were always checking on us and even refilling waters when only half empty...both were downright nice and willy to hang out for periods of time too...if I went back I'd request to be in their sections.  So I'd say overall the place is pretty decent...really kind of a can't miss."}
{"text":"Zipps is such a fun place and it's a great location by the girls here sometimes can have an attitude or they can be super nice so it depends who ya get and how their days been. I love the medium golden wings that is all I ever eat along w their pizza. I've tried other things but for a pizza\burger joint they try too hard to be fancy. The margs are to die for also!! They are always frozen and even in az heat I've never had one melt away before I was done and I didn't have to chug it down before it melted. I like sitting at the bar for lunch, those girls are usually the nicest. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Do you like wings?  If so you'll love Zipp's.  One night out our cab driver decided to tell my boyfriend and I about his Scottsdale favorites.  Everyone has their opinion, and it's all you can do to smile and pretend you care.  This guy was very adamant about Zipp's, and so we decided to look into \"the hottest wings ever.\"  We were so glad we had Mr. Chatty McChatterson as our driver because he was right!  Zipp's has TO DIE FOR wings.  The golden hot was our order, and although a notch down from the hottest flavor, they were still pretty hot.  They are made with habenero peppers and bbq sauce, and dipped in either ranch or blue cheese, a party is created in your mouth.  We thought we made it for the happy hour or even the reverse happy hour, but we managed to make in between those times, go figure.  Go before 6 or after 8 to make your experience even cheaper.  Oh, and grab a zipparita too - a strawberry one.  They seem to compliment the wings quite well!  Go for a game or with a group of people - tons of tv's and a great outdoor space to enjoy drinks and wings."}
{"text":"OK this is the last Zipps review I will write:  I keep giving zipps chance after chance & they continue to fail me. This weekend's update: we've noticed the signs ON EVERY TABLE for the breakfast at 9am during football season with a note \"until daylight savings\" next to the 9am, so we get here at 10am on the dot (since games start an hour later) and they're open. We order drinks around 10:15 and then try to order breakfast only to learn that the kitchen does not open until 11am, about 40 min from then. I ask the manager why the breakfast menus are on every table then, isn't that false advertising? She says its required by management, and if they were to walk in she would get in trouble. What the heck?? They have a menu on every table for breakfast but yet they do not serve breakfast. And its one of those standing specials menu , on the other side are weekend drink specials, WHICH IS ALSO ON ANOTHER MENU ON THE TABLE. Makes ZERO sense. I just don't understand.  And then this may just be me asking for too much, but in my opinion, customer service is huge, so at least be like \"I'm sorry for the inconvenient , here's a drink on us\" like .. a $4.50 bloody mary or what not. But no its, \"No breakfast ,it is what it is, sorry.\". The service and quality has drastically declined since we started coming to this Zipps location the last few years, super bummed about it."}
{"text":"I came in last night with my boyfriend for a couple drinks after work. We got an IPA pitcher for $14 and a turkey club focaccia for $8 and off if their late night menu. The food was great, the environment was nice and our server Amber was outstanding. She was very sweet, attentive, and helpful. I give this Zipps 5 stars because I've been to other locations with servers that didn't really know what they were doing and did not give good service.   If you go to this location request Amber to be your server!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Zipps this week.  We have been to many of the locations, but for this particular location, the two female bartenders that were working were outstanding.  They were efficient, polite, personable, and very on top of it!  Our food was good and the drinks were great.  It was a good atmosphere and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a couple buds for the first time, it isn't a great place, but the golden medium wings are awesome, really the only saving grace. The waitresses are... interesting, the beer selection is bland, basically just the big names, Coors and what not, and it was filled with elderly people eating alone... it was depressing. Maybe I went on the wrong day. I would come back for those wings, some of the best I've ever had, but otherwise, I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat clean. A bit dark inside and too hot to sit outside in Arizona. The food isn't worth the price. Burger didn't have any flavor and the fries wasn't good either. I'm a fries type of guy and I know fries. Haha, maybe it was a bad day I went. But you won't see me returning."}
{"text":"I think that everything about Zipp's is pretty mediocre...except the wings. The wings are amazing especially the really hot ones. They do have some good happy hour specials every day which is nice but I don't think the food is anything outstanding. The fries and onions rings always taste a little soggy to me. This location has a good patio if it isn't too hot. It's a good place to watch games and they also do have strong Zipparitas if you're trying to get after it. I'm never AGAINST going to Zipp's but it also isn't ever the first place I think of."}
{"text":"On a busy night like tonight, Carrie G. was the best server. In a crowded bar and servers running around like headless chickens, she recognized that I needed to place a to go order. She was very sweet, didn't rush me when taking my order, the calm in the middle of the storm. When my order was ready, she was very thorough to check and make sure everything was there and was correct. Everyone should value servers like her! That girl needs a promotion or a serious raise!"}
{"text":"I really don't  like this place.  The food is not good.  I go there sometime to catch a baseball gave but if your not a fan of the local team sometimes they turn it off before the games over.  And never go there on a football day.  But probably the most annoying aspect of this place is how consistent the service is bad.  I had a new server a few weeks ago who was great but shes gone now.  So good luck if you want good service.  And pretty much every time I go with someone else they mess up their food.  Which isnt to say its the servers fault.  The only reason I can think that they dont mess up my food is I usually dont give special instructions. So I think you get the idea about this place."}
{"text":"OMG I warn you, as a fellow pepper-head, watch the hot wings. Only for the waiver signing crowd. And the medium are hotter than most hot and they have a \"golden\" style where thay add some honey and that is really good to try as well. Sandwiches are fine.The wings are great, burgers are great, very loud, always a drunken sports crowd during games or happy hour. I heard the Scottsdale cops pull everyone over as they leave so park down the street,"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! I called to make an order for pickup and went to pick it up and they didn't place the order. The waitress was so rude and yeld to my boyfriend that they don't have an order on our name, WHAT THE HELL????? . I definitely never going back. This eas on Camelback and Miller location, they also told me the location just to make sure, for nothing!!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the atmosphere in here it usually pretty lively. I usually come here for three things Sports, Zipps French Fries, and the Buffalo Focaccia. I've noticed since I get the dish so regularly that it can be hit or miss. One time the chicken can be tender and savory and the next time it can be dry as the desert we live in. It can have a nice blend of wing sauce and ranch (I subsitute ranch for blue cheese) and the next just chicken drowned in ranch without any spice. Mostly though this place is exactly what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"Good sports bar. Great service, decent food, and open til 2am!"}
{"text":"Football Sundays, specials everydays. This place is a great local neighborhood bar..moderately priced and great service! I'm not quite a regular but my food has been the same every time. This place is predictable and brings the same quality every time I go back.  When you work at a place that stays busy with repeat customers, remembering those people is a huge part of the job. They do that and still give good service to the rest of the bar. Food is good and the wings in particular. If you have a game to watch, go to zipps."}
{"text":"Zipp's is always a fun atmosphere. The food is good, beer is cold, and service is friendly. One of my favorite spots to watch sports."}
{"text":"Take the free bus to salt river fields for games  Way better food than your average sports bar. Great outdoor patio. Inside is a bit cramped though."}
{"text":"I would like to compliment the bar staff, managers, and most specifically the kitchen staff, for the great service on the busiest day of the Phoenix Open. These guys and gals are rockin' it!   I've never seen it so busy in here! The fact they are able to keep up with everything is testament to their dedication to their customers.   I hope that anyone that comes out on this extremely busy weekend appreciates what the staff of any Scottsdale establishment is doing to make your experience the best they can."}
{"text":"Who's leg do I have to hump to get a proper margarita in this town?! The wings are pretty much the only thing they've got going on here, not necessarily a bad thing cuz there's something to be said about having the best wings in town...but why be a one-trick-pony when it's sooo easy to excel at several items, if not dozens?!? (especially in this town) Anyways, avoid the specialty drinks, as the only special feeling you'll get is disappointment"}
{"text":"Zipp's has some of the best bar food in the Valley. They have a really good burger menu, with some interesting options. All of their appetizers are good, and the focaccias are great. One word of warning if you order one, they're not the traditional sandwiches, but more like a wrap made out of focaccia. It sounds strange, and you'll give it an odd look the first time you see one, but trust me, it's good.   There's a great outdoor patio assuming you're there on a night that isn't hot. They have plenty of TV's set up around the place, but you don't have a good view of all of them, so Zipps isn't really the kind of sports bar you'd want to go to see all the games. It's more of Monday Night Football spot, it's better to go if there's only one or two big games going on."}
{"text":"We come to this Zipps almost every week after softball since we play down the street in the Scottsdale league.  We have a decent size group, but can always find a place to sit when we get there mid-evening.  We all like to get the 32oz premium drafts for $6.  Then we get a smattering of apps around the table.  The food is good, but I've only really had the appetizers (having never been here for an actual meal)  The nachos are great, they are not shy with the toppings.  The wings and onions rings are always good too.  There is a shuffleboard table and pool.  The wait staff are all super friendly and are good about checking in to see if we need anything."}
{"text":"Zipp's is my go-to spot to watch football on Sundays. It's in a really great location walking distance to the other Old Town bars. I love their happy hour hours it's a nice place to go as your first stop to take advantage of the drink specials especially for the zipparitas! I love that they also have reverse happy hour for the night time games."}
{"text":"Water tastes like it's from the toilet, what should be a 45 minute dining experience was a 2 hour dining experience with how slow the service is here. Food was just plain bland with burnt chicken and stale foccacia. Definitley taking a break before going back especially that I always leave feeling like I have food poisioning."}
{"text":"Great margs- be sure to ask for the Apple Margarita it mighty smooth! Happy hour changes by day, but it's everyday!! Nice outside seating with fire pits. Good crowd and speedy service!"}
{"text":"Great wings. The service is good there is no reason not to enjoy a drink or food during a big game."}
{"text":"This is our spot for sport watching in the hood. The downside, if you sit outside during the day, you can't see what's on TV. They need to upgrade their outdoor televisions.   The food is good. The beers are cold. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is jovial. The people watching is the best since the location is right off Camelback."}
{"text":"Zipps is THE place i recommend for anyone looking to drink some alcohol, munch some tasty wings and watch a good game. Wings arent the only tasty item of course...there's burgers, focaccias, sammies, greenbay chili (good one!), and desserts! Play some pool too, or at least get in line if its a busy night.   For the record, its honey medium wings for me every time...the drink varies."}
{"text":"It's the second Zipps that I've been to and it's pretty comparable to the other one. This one was a little smaller, but the beer selection was decent and the burgers were still okay (nothing to rave about)."}
{"text":"I'm a slut for the monico focaccias.  It can be hit or miss. But I still enjoy the misses...it's a double ding...Ding ding  Onion rings. I'm also a slut for onion rings...and no nonsense."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with amazing food. I have been coming to Zipps for years - the Monaco foaccaca is literally amazing. This place is a definite must!"}
{"text":"We had the best service at zipps tonight! Our server was Shelby.... she was friendly, let us know about all the specials.  Usually the Zipp girls are robots, zero smiles. Shelby made us feel like she actually cared about our experience. Thank you! We will return to that location :)"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible! Came here for margaritas and food after each only having 2 drinks the waitress and manager took it upon themselves to 'cut us off' no reason, no explanation just that they thought we 'had had enough' this is so close to my house and I come here with friends often. The food is atrocious but the vibe and drinks was what we would come for. So if we can't even come here and enjoy a few drinks there is no point! Disrespect and embarrassed! Go zip yourselves"}
{"text":"Horrid bar layout. Pillars block the view of the (only) 3 TVs at the bar.  Wow."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Zipps after going to the dissapointing Wharehouse sale in Scottsdale this weekend. My experience here really rounded out the morning.  There was no place to sit except one tiny table in front of a big screen TV. I bellied up and tried to order fast. There was a crowd of jocks that thought screaming at oddly placed TV's would help their teams to win. I kept trying not to look their way, but I was sitting right in front of the TV so that was a bit difficult. The waitresses that couldn't hear me order so it took about 4 attempts. Once she did hear me she must have forgot I odered in the first place because 2 glasses of tea later I had to hunt her down to order again. Maybe she got brain damage from being around screaming goons all day.. Who knows. The atmosphere was bad, the service was bead... But still 3 stars because they have the BEST wings I've tastes in a long, long time. Next time though, I'll order them to go."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service was amazing (CJ is great!) and the food was tasty. But waking up this morning sick as a dog was not. I thought it was just me or something else I had ate but my friend I went with had the same problems happen around the same time early AM. We both regularly go here but am so disappointed with either the lack of freshness from the food or from the cross contamination of a non edible product that made us sick. Not sure if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I dunno if all Zipps locations practice the same seating arrangement but this location is first come first serve. So, on a busy night, you end up stalking tables trying to get yourself a seat. The bar isn't conducive to standing around and grabbing a drink because the walkway is pretty narrow between the bar stool and the tables.  Anyways, after standing around and stalking two tables, we finally snagged one! I must say, it was slightly awkward standing around watching people and not be able to stand with a drink in hand at least.  I got my favorite golden wings. Finally figured out the perfect combination. I got them medium hot with hot sauce on the side. Which was PERFECT spice level for me. I could control the spicy heat level by dipping my wings into the hot sauce. My mouth is watering as I type this...  We also got the cookie skillet which was a perfect finishing touch with the ice cream on top. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and we were all happy campers :)"}
{"text":"Lots of food was consumed at our table, so I'll start with the wings.  I like hot and spicy, so I ordered them hot.  The server told me their hot was VERY hot (note - they do have a VERY HOT category that is hotter than HOT - lol), and that if I don't like it, they won't refire it and it can't be sent back (clearly this is a recurrent issue and must come out of the servers pay or something.  Either way, she scared me sufficiently, and I NEVER send food back regardless), so, I ordered them MILD, expecting them to be HOT.  And they were, indeed, MILD.  So, my wonderfully cautious server brought me a cup of the HOT sauce.  Holy crap.  This shit was VERY HOT (not to be confused with the VERY HOT wings, mind you).    Is that clear?    To recap, the MILD is MILD, the HOT is VERY HOT, and the VERY HOT is...I was too chicken to find out.  All you really need to know on the wing issue is that if you over-order in hotness and you don't like it, you're screwed.  Moving on..  Had a blue cheese burger.  It had some strong earthy taste, almost like dirt.  I was afraid to check under the bun, as the server could have been annoyed with the wing drama, but it tasted like either weird pot, or dirt.  In reality, it was probably some strange oregano.  Or chervil.  Or marjoram.  Double patty, though.    Fries - good.  Onion rings - EXCELLENT.  Even the next day microwaved, they were yummy.  I wouldn't say I'd drop back in unless I was in the mood for a divey sports bar with wingitude, but I also wouldn't pout and sit in the car."}
{"text":"Nightly specials are my favorite... On Saturdays, focaccia's are only 6.50 and zipparitas are $5. This is great for people who can never make it to happy (but they have that too). It's one of the better sports bars in town."}
{"text":"golden medium wings!!!!!!!! Also really good beer specials and they have some really good looking waitresses"}
{"text":"Zipp's is fast coming the sports bar standard in Phoenix.  Fizzy, yellow beer in big quantities, typical bar food and Zipparitas.  Lots of televisions strategically placed, games and scantly clad servers.  I enjoy visiting on an occasion for the fizzy beer, the occasional burger (the one with the peppers and jack cheese was good) and a good view of the eclectic clientele."}
{"text":"When you make the assertion that a place has \"The best F'ing veggie burgers on the PLANET\" and throw your arms up in the air in exclamation, you better know why you are talking about.   Being that I have been a vegetarian for over 14 years now, I have had a LOT of veggie burgers and I hate to burst your bubble, Dally G, this is NOT the best F'ing veggie burger on the planet. It was tasty, I will give you that, but only because it was smothered with sweet jalapeno sauce, pepper-jack cheese and fresh jalapenos. I am not a fan of those garden patty's. Nor my soggy fries.   Both times I have been here it was pretty packed. The first time, on a Sunday, the service was horrible and the waitress was quite the snob. Fortunately last nights visit was quite a bit better, but I think that is because our waitress wanted to give me the business.   So... they have some good specials, I will give them that. The food is okay. The service leaves a little something to be desired. I couldn't figure out which bathroom I was supposed to use and the parking is pretty bad. but, they do have a cool patio with fire pits.    Because I am nice and the coffee is good this morning I am rounding up my 2.5 stars to a 3."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm really impressed how Zipp's manages to be so close to typical Scottsdale clubs, yet doesn't endure a smidgen of pretentious clientele. This is a place for large groups to chug beer, watch sports highlights, and if brave enough, chomp on greasy bar food.   $8 for a freaking pitcher of Ranger IPA made me a happy camper. That's all I really need! I can have one of those and call it a night. But you know me, I like to party.   Prices on shots like Fireball and Jager were also very reasonable. This is such a great place to be social; I like watching the occasional early walk of shame around 1:30 from the patio while I chat it up with friends.   Apps were interesting...I tried some sort of roast beef spring roll, but it wasn't my cup of tea. No matter what, the food is inexpensive, and the kitchen is open late. Men, if you don't want to deal with an army of bros and cheap cologne, come here. Ladies, if you don't feel like 5 inch heels and pushup bras, stop by. This place is fun."}
{"text":"Man. I'm torn about this place. Let's talk good stuff first: It's convenient, it's close to everything. I love their zipparitas in every flavor, they often have great deals on food and drinks. It's a great place for watching sporting games.   I mean it all sounds great, right? Everything you'd want in a sports bar. Well listen up, about 80% of the servers there are just straight twats. The customer service blows big ones. Idk why they've even got attitude, some of them aren't even cute. Check yourself girlfriend. I get it, you're busy. But we're your customers, get that bitchy look off your face. Enough with that rant, aside from their god awful customer service - some of their items are mediocre at best. They charge you for every side of ranch. Oh wait, you're not making enough money off all the drinks we have there, you need $.25 for the ranch too? It's a pet peeve of mine. Don't charge extra for condiments!   Sad thing is even tho I get so frustrated with this place, I'll still come here and tolerate their rude servers because sometimes you get lucky and there's a new server who isn't jaded like the rest of those B's. And those damn zipparitas. I love 'em. Sooner or later, I'll give up on this place for good."}
{"text":"I like this particular Zipps. I appreciate the 32oz beers and the Bloody Mary's! Courtney is a fantastic bartender!! Friendly staff and a great bar selection!!"}
{"text":"As a sports bar in Scottsdale it is about as good as it gets.  However I sports bars overall goes Zipps is merely average.  The only way to describe the place is AVERAGE. Average food, average prices, average drinks, virtually no craft beer selections and average service.  Only good thing is a nice shuffleboard table."}
{"text":"Regret coming here everytime. Not because the food is terrible, it's decent nothing special, but edible and they're open late.   I regret coming here because the customer service is terrible. Is it that hard to HELP your guests, or to be courteous to your guests rather than making it seem as though you have better things to do. Managers aren't any better.   Ugh, annoying."}
{"text":"Very rarely will I write a review, but tonight's experience at Zipp's leaves me no choice.  Our waitress, Lacey P, had an attitude from the moment we arrived. I'm not sure what was bugging her, but it was certainly nothing that our party of three did.  Midway through our meal, as she was clearing plates off the table, she accidentally dropped a carrot slice from somebody's salad into my beer. That's no big deal. Staff has accidents all the time. The issue just begins here though. Lacey P didn't apologize or acknowledge me. She simply took my half finished beer, and after five minutes, returned with a new beer in a smaller cup. She explained that I received the smaller cup because the beer she had ruined was not a full beer.  I'm not going to fight with a waitress, however if you make a mistake, you need to correct it properly. A simple apology would have been fine and no new beer would have been necessary.  The night was fine again until it was time for Lacey P to remove the rest of our plates. At which time, she flung a knife across the table, assuming it would land in our wing basket. However, said knife did not land in said wing basket. It landed about 4 inches from my leg.  I find this behavior dangerous above all. I can't, in good conscience return to Zipp's ever again. I can get over poor service, but I absolutely can't get over such blatant disregard for safety.  Lacey P, if you're having a bad day, don't come into work. It's that simple. No need to endanger Zipp's customers.  What a terrible, terrible experience."}
{"text":"Awesome Attentive service. We got our drinks almost as soon as we sat down which was awesome. Such a fun place to go after volleyball at ISP down the road. I had the buffalo chicken salad which was so good. The chicken had a ton of buffalo sauce on it which I really love. Several people got the fish tacos which also looked really good.   They have a special margarita that's only $3 during happy hour which I believe is after 10 pm. They also have blue moon and some other domestics on tap. We all had a great time and really enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"This place was great the first time I came (back in st Patrick's day) but the second time, they ruined my 21st birthday! Came out with my girls (group of 15) for dinner and drinks and they would not accommodate us when it was time to pay! After the waitress and manager himself came out and told us he wouldn't split the bill, but would allow swiping as many cards and taking cash, to complete our bill. We were ready to pay and he comes out and told us he wouldn't accept different payments, only ONE CARD/CASH. We tried coming to an agreement because several people didn't even buy anything so it made no sense in why we would all have to split the bill. The manager was super rude and just blew the situation out of proportion. He's really lost all of our business and has disappointed us all. My coworkers are all regulars."}
{"text":"The customer service here is AWFUL!  The manager is less than nice, even at the best of times.  I was at Zipps recently for several college ball games, where thank goodness Megan our server was amazing, because the rest of the service was horrible. Not only was I in attendance for bad behavior on management's part, but also able to read an atrocious letter written to a friend simply because she wrote a bad review. I will NEVER be stepping foot in Zipps again, and will be forwarding the letter to ALL my friends.  The food isnt that great, and the beer is cheaper is most other establishments, where management is generally nicer.  I only wish I could give ZERO STARS!"}
{"text":"Zipps is a local favorite and honestly has the best wings I have ever had. Between their 32 ounce beers, medium golden honey wings and happy hour specials this is the place to be for sports events.   It does get packed quickly and the TV selection is a little iffy at the Camelback location but the food and atmosphere make up for it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite patios to be on on a warm sunny day. Their food and specials don't hurt either. I love this place."}
{"text":"Their wings are some of the best in town by far atmosphere pretty great and a out door patio 4 when the weather is good love this place  food is AAA+ Bar AAA+ Atmosphere. AAA+"}
{"text":"If I could give a half star I would. The waitress was a sweety but the food was awful. My salad was not cleaned or cooled and it was warm!! The sandwich wasn't the greatest either. Just wanted to hurry up and get out of here. The restroom was disgusting too. I suggest to go to another place."}
{"text":"The food was over priced for the quality. The appetizers were a joke. I and my boyfriend both have been puking foam since we ate here. I'll gladly never eat here again"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great place to watch games with your friends or just hang out.. Lots of deals basically all the time. $4 for 32oz domestic drafts and $3.50 zipparitas on Wed. Favorite place to go to watch SF Giants games- best part is the Scottsdale Trolley goes straight there and its a short walk to the rest of the bars in Old Town. I had a buffalo chicken foccacia, wan't that great (companred to 4 peaks) but good for bar food. Personally I don't like the onion rings but the fries are good"}
{"text":"We love coming here for happy hour 4-7, its always noisy and crowded, but the buffalo wings are yummy( ordered crispy) and the zipparitas are delish. The burgers and salads are good as well like the green chili burger or the buffalo salad. They have pizza and wraps, but we havent tried those items as they are loaded with carbs. We like the service and staff allot. There are a few different games on the TVs, and the patio is great during the cool months. Very casual, but solid consistent service and food."}
{"text":"First off, I am not much of a sports fan -- and I rarely frequent sports-bar themed restaurants. I was presently surprised by Zipp's upon my first, of what has become, many visits...  The atmosphere is very clean and open (as sports bars go), the staff are friendly, they have a smoking-friendly-patio, and the bar is good sized.  The food is a notch or two above pub-grub. Tons of choices from salads and veggie trays, to mouthwatering burgers, chicken strips and  Pizza. Lots of beers to choose from, and LCD TV's everywhere.  Zipp's is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"As previously stated, this is a Sports bar, and it does that well.  TVs outside, pretty good food and every time I have been in there, excellent service.  There are bars and pubs in the are I prefer, as I don't need my sports bars to be fancied up.  They do have New Belguim's Sunshine Wheat on draft, a nice change, and they run good specials."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was warm and would make you feel welcome as a sports bar, the staff was friendly and very attentive to their customers needs. The menu was very limited and didn't have many drinks to offer but keep in mind this is a sports bar not something that specializes in mixed drinks. I order the wings, like a spicy honey barbecue and was pretty darn good I must say, the bloody marry was not bad and was not overly salty. I will be returning to this restaurant to try other things"}
{"text":"This place is our safe place.  So far they haven't gotten our order wrong, everyone has been incredibly nice and there is always a game on.  The wings are pretty good.  I prefer the golden wings over the hot wings but you can still spice those puppies up.    The best thing about happy hour is the zipperita.  For 3 bucks for a frozen 2 1/2 shots of tequila goodness.  One thing I do not understand about this place is they will not serve you a shot unless you have half a beer left.  They think it controls alcohol intake but what it really does is force me to drink faster.  Big fan!  Please check this place out."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Wrong order to table. The north Scottsdale location is ten times better.  Horrible experience.  Management needs to know about the poor service. Food sucked    Horrible overall!!"}
{"text":"I like going to Zipps once in a while.    I haven't been to this location in many years, but we were in the area recently running errands and decided to stop in for a quick bite between appointments.  It was a Saturday afternoon and luckily it wasn't very busy.  We didn't have much time so we ordered a drink and some chips and salsa.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  The chips and salsa came out quickly and were pretty tasty.  I think we were able to get in, have a beer and nosh, and get out in less than half an hour.  I appreciate the speed when we were on a time crunch.  I would definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! I wish I could give it no stars. I had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week. Their PR person contacted me and asked more about it, so I told them. They asked if they could pass my information along to the Director of Operations/Owner and I received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that I am a self-righteous b*tch who knows nothing about customer service and I only care about myself.   Todd Goldman, the owner who so kindly took \"the time to teach young girls like [me] life lessons\" about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that I \"get so mad and take it so personally that [I] fail to think rationally while [I] struggle with the idea that [I am] not the most important person in the world\". Apparently my \"myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of [myself] are staggering\". Whatever he may feel about me, I do know one thing about him: I will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again. This does not seem to bother Mr. Goldman because, as he told me in his letter from this evening, according to him, \"[I] feel that [I] am so influential in this community that [my] posting will dissuade people from visiting [their] establishments\". I only wish I could attach the PDF letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it.   I cannot imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer, and yes, I do hope that people read this and see that they should pick Fox Sports Grill, Half Moon, Blue 32, Firehouse Bar and Grill, Duke's, American Junkie or any of the 1000 other sports bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix to enjoy their bar food, beer and sports viewing. It is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and Mr. Goldman should be ashamed of himself.    ***ADDITION 10/19/2010*** I was currently in the building with 11 guests, sitting at a 6 person table when I asked to be accommodated.  I was not asking him to \"hold\" tables for us, I was asking that they take care of  \"actual customers\"."}
{"text":"Easily been here at least 5 times a month since I have been in Arizona. My friends and I always come for the wings and beers to watch the games. I am moving back home and my friends asked where I wanted to final day to be. Of course I said Zipps. Best sports bar around!"}
{"text":"Good location, decent food. My favorite remains teh Foccahia's."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in my entire life. The focaccia was so undercooked that it was still literal dough, the cheese was not even fully melted. Not to mention the fries were cold. I placed the order to go and was told that it would be about 15-20 minutes until my order was ready. 45 minutes later I'm still standing by the bar waiting for my order. Not a single employee was polite nor apologetic. Simply dissatisfied. Would not ever recommend coming to this location."}
{"text":"Zipp's can be hit or miss at times but if you're looking for an affordable friendly atmosphere this is your place. Service is usually best at the inside tables I've found. It's always open seating so it can be tricky to find a table during crowded times. Also if you're looking for a quiet bite and beer avoid major game times and late night weekends."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if excellent customer service is what you are looking for, this is not the place for you.  Are the waitresses nice?....Sometimes.  Are they efficient?.....Not usually.  Do they get the orders right?.....most of the time.  Do I love this place anyway???.....ABSOLUTELY!  Here's why -   Value of Happy Hour / Reverse Happy Hour / Weekend specials - 5 stars!  There are not many places you can get a slice of pizza, a basket of wings (Golden Medium, yummm) AND a 32 oz frosty beer for about $10 bucks.  They have daily specials, happy hour specials, weekend specials, and late night specials.  If wings are not your thing, try the Monaco Focaccia - it is to die for!  Ambiance - Ehhhh - 3 stars.  This is just your typical sports bar.  No special ambiance to note.  However - bring your shooting skills, and give the arcade game Big Buck Hunter a try for some laughs, OR coerce your friends into playing some pool.  I will concur with previous guests comments that the management at this establishment leaves something to be desired.  I have had several experiences where management failed to provide a service or take care of a customer, and was less than apologetic about their unwillingness to help.  All in all, I love Zipps - mostly for its convenience and it's cheap prices.  I'd still recommend it though! :)"}
{"text":"Bar Food at its best. This place has been a lunch staple for a group of us at the office for years which to me says it all. You won't be wowed with the offerings but they never disappoint, making it exactly what you would come to expect. Therein lies the magic.  Go with the Fish Tacos or the Philly Focaccia (more of a wrap than a focaccia and also not like a true Philly Steak, but still very tasty)."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of wings across the country.. these are they best in Arizona!!!! Hands down service is great. Hope you can find a seat when you get here"}
{"text":"The golden wings are awesome! Focaccia  rolls are another favorite, especially the buffalo chicken one. Service is generally quick and very friendly. Kind of noisy if you sit outside. My 10 year old asks to come here every time we are in town."}
{"text":"It actually hurts me to give Zipps on Camelback and Miller a two star rating but after going in there for several years at least two times a week to watch my favorite sports teams compete I have no choice. I will say, if I could only rate the service and staff, they are 5 stars...Jordan, Kat, Cj, Katie, Bethany, Allison, and Kelsey, just to name a few of who we have got to know who have been there awhile, always happy to take care of the customers, however this Yelp is not about the them, it's about those who own the franchises in the Phoenix area... mind you it's one family that owns all the Zipps in the valley. For the last two years, the misters did not work properly until this summer, the heaters work occasionally or not at all, the TV's need replacing cause pictures are blurry or a TV just doesn't work, signage lights have been out and not working for a long time, and regular patio lights just burned out and not replaced. The bugs have been dead inside your Main Zipps sign for the last three years, I like seeing them when I'm eating. I find it funny how you manage to keep your great staff when your customers complain to them about the upkeep and in turn your staff is making excuses for you... the owners. There are much better places that are up to date, have better patios with working equipment, and more healthier food options. In the end , price doesn't matter, people will pay more when their needs are being met and by the looks of your popularity over the years, you are losing. It's no wonder that your business is empty on big sports nights, because you are not making your place stand out. Instead you keep building more Zipps in the Valley, you should capitalize on your biggest patio bar in the area, Scottsdale Old Town, poor business decision on your part. I posted some pictures, so all could see first hand as well as a picture of our regular black olive pizza slices.... definitely cutting back on the Vegetables, usually cannot see the cheese over the black olives, however obvious money is tight."}
{"text":"Zipp's Sports Grill is exactly what it appears to be...there isn't any nuance and if you are expecting any, you are likely in the wrong place! If you want a pretty good burger, pretty good wings, pretty good salads, pretty good sides (fries, rings, etc.) Zipp's will do nicely.  No, I won't tell you that they have the best anything, but they do a decent job across a pretty broad range of sports bar food...nothing that they make is crappy. Once again, this was a place that I quit patronizing for awhile, until the cigarette smoke and the after-effect smell got wrung out of the building. But, I'm glad to be back. I played Squash for a couple of hours on Saturday morning and I was pretty hungry at lunch, and Zipp's was close by, so... We hadn't been in for several months (so many restaurants, so little time), and was nice to come back. The service was terrific, prompt and friendly. It may depend on who you get as a server, or the time of day (we were there for lunch) but we've always been lucky and well taken care of at Zipp's. I had a Zipp Burger and the Beautiful Carin had a big ol' chopped salad. Both were good and tasty, well prepared (even down to getting Carin's order right...no cheese, 2 different dressings on the side, etc., etc., etc.). After de-toxing with couple of hours of hard exercise, re-toxing at Zipp's was a good way to get my cholesterol levels back up!"}
{"text":"Zipp's is one of my favorite locations. They have plenty of TVs so you can watch a game or two while you enjoy your food and drinks. Their golden wings are a fantastic appetizer. They have great burgers and wraps. The cookie skillet is always worth it. The outdoor patio with the fire pit is great for late night appetizers and drinks. Be sure to check the deals for the particular day of the week that you go. You can usually save a good amount of money on great appetizers or drinks. The service has always been great.   I am extremely happy that more and more Zipp's locations have opened up in other areas of town."}
{"text":"My favorite Zipps location out of all of them. They always get my order done correctly and takeout is always piping hot when I take it home. Their wings are their go to staple, delicious, flavorful, and I love them extra crispy. Another favorite item of mine is their mozzarella sticks. This spot is great to watch any sports either indoors or out in their large patio."}
{"text":"Its a sports bar. Food and drinks of sports bar caliber. Sometimes what you really want is wings and some beer.  Zipps can take care of that for you."}
{"text":"This Zipps is getting ridiculous! I have been coming here for YEARS (live within a few blocks). I politely questioned the number of drinks that was on my bill and the brand new female 'manager'  (Chicago lady w longer Brown hair - old Rosati's bartender) couldn't even handle the situation. This use to be a fun bar, now it's a waste of time. There are 50 other bars within a mile, go to one of those and save yourself the headache. For a sports bar, their TV'S are inadequate and horribly placed, their HH isn't that good and their service is declining fast."}
{"text":"Zipp's is a microcosm of what's wrong with Phoenix, and especially Scottsdale. I've been here about a dozen times, so I'm not a regular, but it's more than one experience. The service here sucks giant rhino balls, to put it bluntly. Which seems odd considering the number of wait staff they typically have.  I went in here with a group of about two-dozen people on a Tuesday night in 2009 and they carded all of us. Fine. We all came straight from the job (guitars, think about it) so it's not like we were dressed down. One guy which with us, age 32, was from Mexico and had his national ID. And these fools wouldn't accept it! Even the manager! Ok, so we took our $300+ to the place next door (One Eyed Dog, now Clancys) and they served us all.  But that's not it. I've come here only because of proximity and waited what seemed like 5-10 minutes to get a drink on a slow weekend! It's like the waitstaff puts a priority on their texts and that's it. Fuck this place, the only reason I give it 2 stars is at least their hamburgers are decent."}
{"text":"Ahhhh the Regal Beagle... So much to say and so little characters. Beers are always great, can't beat the wings, and the burgers are awesome. I've been coming to zipps on camelback since it took over for fast Freddy's before you probably moved here. Amazing for football, but don't ask to switch the channels, check the helmets on the TVs and find where you should sit. In the summer, it's an ideal neighborhood bar, where - except for downtown scottsdale over flow or pre party crowd weekend nights. otherwise, leave your BS at the door, learn your bartenders name, and have a conversation. Love zipps, it's a scottsdale institution."}
{"text":"ZIPPS, baby!  I love watching the football games here because ZIPPS prepares a giant steamy melting pot of fans rooting for different teams.  Even the employees working here show their support for their favorite teams every Sunday.  I've only been here on Thursdays and Sundays.  The Golden hot wings are phenomenal and they have Alaskan on tap.  I try to go every Sunday and if I could, I would go every Sunday if that hot wing sauce didn't burn a hole through my pocket."}
{"text":"This review is only for the bar and cocktails. The ladies behind the bar were friendly and attentive and also mentioned the happy hour specials of the morning. Who doesn't love a good Bloody Mary cheap? We most certainly do. There's also a cool outdoor area with plenty of tv's to watch and chill. We have hung out here before during Spring Training and it is always a hot spot...."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the reviews I've seen about zipps.  I'm from California and think its way better then buffalo wild wings.  I always try and eat here when I'm visiting. I've been to a lot of different locations and some have been awesome  and some just good but haven't had a bad experience. Great wings, good selection of beer and good quesadilla.  My girlfriend also likes their chicken fingers and margaritas"}
{"text":"Since this place is right by place I go here often. I stop going couple months ago because the service disappoint me. However, I went back three weeks ago to have their famous black and blue burger which I love. As we sat down, we were greeted by friendly server who took our order. Gotta say I was really surprised to see improvement in service side.  Since I went there couple more times.   Thank you for great service Zipps keep it up."}
{"text":"Checked out this location a few times including my visit today. Went in for the playoff Packers Cowboys game and had fast service outside. I ordered the hot buffalo wings and a bud light, $12 total which is pretty good!  This location is nice, food are in large portions and is pretty decent. Besides that, you get what you expect from a Zipps. Packers won too!"}
{"text":"Use to be a great place, now the food is not as good as it once was.  The help during the time I went was sadly lacking.  On to the next place."}
{"text":"Zippity Do Da Zippity....  That Disney song from such a long time ago comes to my head whenever I go to Zipps or hear the name.  Just like how the song has a melodic chill feeling, Zipps is a chill and cool place to hang out to watch a game, eat some food, and drink a beer.  For bar type of food, the quality of the food is actually quite good.  I have had their chicken sandwich, turkey sandwich, and chicken salad.  They have a great variety of beer and other liquor to keep you satisfied more than a nights worth."}
{"text":"This Zipps is my favorite one.  The location is close to home and I love I can ride my bike for a Zipparita !  I stick with your standard hot wings and a strawberry Zipparita.  Honestly, I think I've had something different....once.  I just prefer to have what I like!   The location is clean and the patio is great!  Bartenders are always friendly and fast, fast is always good when it comes to alcohol. :)  Shuffleboard isn't always open, but the upside is...they have pool and the touch screen game thingy (that's my favorite).   If you don't want the unce unce, but what to be in Old Town this is not a bad place to be.  Also, if you want to change up the scenery Clancy's is next door which is also a great spot !"}
{"text":"They won't grill their wings and they come at 10 not a dozen or a pound. Their sauce, in fact, can be beat. The mozzarella sticks are wrapped in spring roll paper, not bad just not my thing.   Go to the Irish bar next door, seriously."}
{"text":"I was here for Happy Hour a couple weeks ago and I realized that I have never written a review even though I have been here many times. Since I know my adoring fans are anxiously waiting to hear my thoughts on this place, I am happy to oblige.  Zipp's is not a bad option for a work lunch since they have a pretty large menu and can accommodate big parties. The food is mostly bar food with burgers, pizza, fried apps, and wings as their specialties, none of which are my top choice for lunch. But they do have the option of what they refer to as focaccias; they are sort of a cross between a wrap and a panini.  Those are pretty tasty but unfortunately they all come with mayo or some other kind of creamy sauce (yuck!) and so I have to order it without and hope the kitchen gets it right. My go-to item is actually the honey balsamic salad. It is really filling because of all the stuff that's in it and the dressing is really good and goes well with the goat cheese. Overall its not the best food in the area (hey, its Scottsdale after all) but its a safe bet since there is something for everyone and the prices are reasonable.  Zipps is also a great place for happy hour. They have a large patio that is just fantastic because of the wood and comfy seating. You kind of get the feeling you are hanging out on a friend's deck. It can get a little crowded at times, especially on Fridays. And I wish there were more shade. But when the weather is nice you can't beat sitting out in the sunshine with a cold beer watching the game (yes they have tvs outside). Even when the heat drives you inside to the a/c, this place is still worth a visit because of the $3 pints. That's a pretty good deal. They also have $4 for the large 32 oz but that doesn't include the \"premium\" beers.  Overall, there is nothing that really makes Zipp's a \"must try\" place but it is a pretty decent option to go and grab a beer after work."}
{"text":"Zipps used to be the place to go and get a meal at a decent price. However 6 months ago or so they printed new menus, changed some menu verbiage and raised the prices three dollars per item with minimal improvements. I'm not quite sure why I just paid 7 dollars for a side salad then an extra 50 cents when I asked for more dressing because my first 3oz ramekin of dressing was barely half filled. I get it. You need to increase prices but a side salad for 7.50 seems a little excessive and if you're gonna charge for extra dressing make sure the first one is at least filled properly."}
{"text":"Zipps is my neighborhood go-to spot.  There's always a special; except for one hour between 7-8, we like to refer to it as the 'un-happy hour' but that doesn't distract from the good time you'll have.  The beer is always cold and the glasses are generally chilled, unless they're super busy, then they're freshly cleaned.  The staff is friendly and plentiful.  There's generally a manager cruising the floor (or helping the waitstaff when it's really busy) making sure everything is going as expected.  My only negative is they don't allow dogs on the patio like almost every other bar & grill with a patio in the area (Duke's, Pranksters Too, The Habit, The Morning Squeeze, Gilligan's, etc.)  The reason they give is due to health codes.  Regardless, they have their reasons and it doesn't keep me from going, but it does keep me from going as much.    Still, lots of sports on the TVs, cold beer and good food; all at reasonable prices, especially for Scottsdale.  Paired with friendly, consistent service.  Zipps is a great place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"They wouldn't play the free UFC fights because they \"had to play hockey and basketball\". Guess they didn't want people staying and paying for food and drinks to change one TV."}
{"text":"This place gets one star because the bartender was nice. I ordered a chicken quesadilla for lunch today. It was beyond disgusting. The chicken was chunks of fat that I couldn't chew. I had to throw more than half of it out. I wouldn't serve that low grade barely edible chicken to my dog!!! So disgusting. Never returning."}
{"text":"Very good experience at Zipps Camelback tonight! Arrived at 11:45pm (kitchen closes at 12am). Had the chicken skewers and fries, 2 Don Julio shots and 2 Long Island ice teas, total was $43. Server was adorable and efficient, music was good and the TVs were accessible! Excellent visit and a very viable option for late nite dining!"}
{"text":"I love how there's still a nightly special even when happy hour ends. The wings are the best here and the burgers are surprisingly amazing! The last time I was here I had exceptional service. The server was named Kristin/Kristen I believe."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE to come to this place, all of them across the valley really. BUT this time was sub par and not because of the food or our server. It was the manager! We found a piece of hair in my girlfriend's focaccia - literally wrapped inside of the second slice. We had already ate the first slice and found it peaking out of the second. We even pulled on it to check what it was, and it was sliding out of the focaccia. My gf nearly vomited. So, naturally we sent it back. BUT THENNN, the manager came back and said it was my gf's piece of hair!!! Whaaaat??!?! We'd been here for nearly an hour ate 3 other items and onto our 3rd round of drinks - what did she think, we sabotaged the focaccia!?!?! LMAO What a JOKE. Completely argued with us and made my gf feel like complete crap. Unfortunately accusing us that we're liars is not the best way to retain a local customer."}
