{"text":"Been here a few times, Decent selections and food is ok. Girls are attractive but man service is not up to par. Took forever to even get served and we were a group of 12 with a not so busy atmosphere at the time. Not really welcoming, but oh well."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's hottest waitresses who don't know how to waitress!   Aside from that, this place has a HUGE beer selection. Food is mediocre. I occasionally come here for lunch."}
{"text":"Love love love the beer selection and food, service is ALWAYS a nightmare especially when you go there during very busy times. Yes the waitresses/bartenders are all gorgeous but they are never very friendly, do not know the menu/beers on tap and take a very long time to come check up on your tables. I have ordered take out a few times and it's hit or miss whether they act like you are bothering them with taking your order or not. When I go to pick it up I wait a good 5 to 10 mins before someone even bothers to look at me, a female, at a bar full of men. It is nice that you can help yourself at night to the cooler and pay for the beer at the bar, that keeps your beer fresh and cool."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! Don't waste your time or money! Husband and I went to watch the Pens game, place was packed, had 1 bartender and 2 waitresses for the who establishment. Our waitress was too busy making shots and checking her text messages to get us food or beer. Table of 2 behind us had to request a new waitress as well. Had to go to the bar to order our last round before we closed out! Not hot waitresses as everyone else says...We describe them as Completely clueless! There was no manager or owner visible in this place! Shame on whoever runs it! They are surely losing tons of money every second as we went elsewhere to watch the rest of the game and to eat dinner. They are not even worth 1 star!"}
{"text":"FLATBREAD was disgusting. ...tasted like pillsbury dough with jarred alfredo.....turkey burger awful too. SKIP THE FOOD."}
{"text":"Decent bottle selection (what do you expect) but very weak tap selection and spotty service. Yes, they hire good looking waitresses.  I queston the overall quality of the food, but I have had the occasional great meal there."}
{"text":"Service is horrendous.  Ordered the mixed grill salad.  Shrimp was mushy.  Fish was over cooked. Beef was Delicious.  Salad was bland.  Toms onions & cucumbers the size of Connecticut.  A few shreds of cheese.  Not impressed.  Price on website was not correct.  Ended up being $2 more.  Which would have been ok if it was good. Very disappointing. The worst part was the rudeness of the \"servers\"."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 5 years, but I can't imagine ever going back. A little background, went on a Friday night for drinks and dinner.  There were no games going on so it wasn't busy and there were plenty of open tables. Beer selection is great although they don't know how to pour a Guinness - 4 inches of head.  Food has always been decent.   Service was deplorable.  Took 15 minutes for waitress to come to our table with no beer menus or food menus in hand, and she only knew a few of the beers they had on tap.  From the time we sat down to receiving two beers it was 35 minutes.  Waitress was oblivious and unapologetic to the situation.   Management seems to be non-existent. Decided to leave and go elsewhere to eat, drink and spend our money."}
{"text":"Thought this was a sports bar...bartender refused to put the pirate game on; instead had to listen to horrible music on the jukebox."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be back. Sat down and noticed several wait staff standing around but no one greeted us for about 10 minutes. And it wasn't very busy and was around the dinner hour. Several wait staff passed us and never once said that someone would be with us. The girls in the wait staff seemed to have attitudes and seemed to care more about talking and looking at their phones then providing customers proper service. We ordered food and drinks. Food wasn't that great, typical bar food. Wouldn't go back to this restaurant. Why would I give my money to a place that has poor service and not so great food. It's a shame, as if this place provided better service, could probably be a decent place to go to. If you're looking for a friendly environment, wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out with friends and have a glass or two beers. They have a good selection of beers, lots of TVs to watch you favorite games. I did not order any food, went there after dinner to get a beer, so cannot comment on the food. The beer selection is good, and the service is very good. It seems like a popular place to hang out. This was my first time and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Service sucks, always has. The girls are rude until it's time for you to pay your bill. Tried their own craft beer and it was awful. 0-4 people liked it. We all ended up ordering Helicon Brewing. Awful after taste"}
{"text":"beer selection is excellent, service is the worst and have been there a few times...the food is awsome!  seems like take out would be your best bet if going here...the service is always bad, order out!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience there. The food was decent, well priced and portion sizes were good. Service was excellent; based on the other reviews we might have just been lucky. Beer selection was very nice as well. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This  used to be a favorite place  of mine, but it's really taken a nosedive in the last year.  The food selection is typical American fare, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, salads, wings...the usual. Sadly, it really suffers in the quality dept.    They usually have decent beer specials, and since their expansion they've added more taps, so there's usually  something yummy (craft beer) on draft.   If you go to eat any time after 7:30 p.m. on the weekend you will get to enjoy to the parade of skanky-ness that comes out at dark.   The place becomes so packed with bros you will actually be able to TASTE the cologne  in the air around you. It also seems that they've upgraded their sound system. Last weekend we went after taking a long hiatus from this place and it sounded like a thumping strip club.  It's likely that you will have to wait a very long time to to get a table. We tend to go before then, so we don't have to deal with the hoards of Zack Bagginses."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was one of a kind! It's like the waitress wanted to get to know me! The in house brewed beer will quickly become one of my favorite drink options. The owner Mark also came to the table to check up on our food and service a few times the time we were there. Very outstanding guy! I'd recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beer, many drafts and even more bottles, food is good and the prices are right."}
{"text":"Rarely do I find myself in this part of town, but on a Friday after work I went here for some drinks per a co-workers recommendation. Pretty nondescript sign as I drove by the place at first glance.  Inside my initial impression is that the place looks new and clean, two things you can't argue about - even though it's apparently been around for a decade.  There's really not much character. It's a sports bar and seems like it would be a good place to watch a game with two large projection screens and lots of TV's it's fairly clear what they're going for as the appeal, and they're situated behind the bar.  They have a modest selection of beer on tap and several coolers full of bottled varieties. Not a huge selection by any means but the pricing seemed very fair to me.  I ordered some cheese sticks that were very good, so I can't speak much for the menu otherwise.  Overall, it's a sports bar with friendly and attractive female bartenders. So if that's your thing, id recommend it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a disaster of a place! Wow!    A group of friends got together and decided to have drinks and dinner after work here. We made a reservation to ensure that we would have a table and collected there over a few minutes. the place looks nice. It's clean, bright, and the industrial look and feel works nicely. One side is completely occupied by the U-shaped bar and the woman working there was relatively quick in getting our orders. She did tend to disappear for long stretches of time, so getting refills was a chore.   Once our whole group arrived, we asked her to point us to our table only to find out that was not her task. She pointed to someone else .. who then pointed to a table with a piece of paper on it, so we walked over there. We were quickly provided with more menus than we could use as well as cutlery, and then left to look things over. We decided on an appetizer to share - the nachos - as well as what our main meals would be... and then we waited ... and waited ... and waited some more. About 20 minutes in, I asked a worker who walked by if we were forgotten? She gave me a startled look and ran off without saying a word. However, a few minutes later, our waitress showed up. She only wanted to take our drink order but we \"convinced\" her to take the appetizer and entree orders as well.  Drinks and the appetizer came out quickly. However, the nachos were a mess. Take tortilla chips that you get in the supermarket, pour some thinned-down Velveeta on a corner of the plate, throw some pickled Jalapenos (maybe 10 slices) over the top, and then garnish with some shredded Kraft \"Mexican blend\" cheese and serve cold. Not good.  For our entrees we had to wait another 40 minutes. Not sure why it took so long as they were on their regular menu. One of us got the fish sandwich and he said it was practically inedible as it was fried until the whole thing was a brick! Another got the Chicken Fajita Warp which was completely tasteless and room temperature. Other got the Chicken Parmesan plates... and most of it was left in the plates because of overcooking the chicken and a completely uninteresting sauce. We waited for so long and we get ... trash.  The beer menu was also a disappointment. Mostly humdrum offerings that you can pick up in any supermarket around town. Definitely a place to be avoided."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, still not sure if I even had a waitress. Nice selection of drinks and food was decent. Staff was unprofessional and outright rude."}
{"text":"Went here to watch a big college football game with a group of about 20.  Staff insisted on one bill for all of us- thankfully we knew in advance and could plan to bring cash.  But really, would it be so much trouble to give my family of four our own bill?  The service was poor.  Forever to get drinks, and had to literally flag down our waitress several times to even get a food order.  She walked right past us and refused to make eye contact.  The food was fair.  We had the soft pretzels with cheese dip.  For the price, it could've been a much nicer portion than the small portion we wound up with.  We also had a pizza, which was adequate, if messy.  And we were shorted utensils, so that was difficult.   Also, we were not provided with real plates- just very small, saucer shaped plates.  Not conducive to a slice of messy pizza.  No visible managers.  We will not be back, even though we live close by."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Very cute wait staff. Always a decent crowd at night. Food is pedestrian."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to stop when we go back to visit Pittsburgh.  They have a great selection of both food and beer.  Although we did not find onion rings on the menu that we recalled from previous visits we were happy to learn they still offered them and they are out of this world!  We always find the wait staff to be very attentive (and attractive!).  The owner is a very sweet guy (and single).  This place is also close to the high-end houses in Nevillewood where many professional athletes reside.  You may be lucky enough to meet  one or more of them at his place."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the 10 years it has been open.  My wife and I stopped there recently for a Friday happy hour visit.  They have 50 cent wings and draft specials during happy hour.    As others have said the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Our waitress was average at best.  The wings we had were ok.  Sauce selection was far from extensive.  Fries were frozen and from a bag but were ok as well.  Nice beer selection, and I believe they are starting their own microbrew soon as well.  Place is clean and somewhat large.  Doors open to have a nice open feel except for the cigar shop a few stores down and people smoking stogies with the smoke coming in.  I am going to give the Bottleshop another try with either a chef special or sandwich.  It's ok, but you won't go out of your way to stop here."}
{"text":"Known for their very attractive wait staff, but that shouldn't mean that good service and friendliness be sacrificed. While our waitress was overly made up with a full face of makeup, yet dressed down in leggings (must be the dress code), not once did I see her smile. However, I did notice her take special attention (with smiles and batting of the eyelashes) to a table of 20-something year old men.  No joke, she did not once smile at us, in which I suppose I shouldn't be surprised since our group consisted of married couples.   While service was terrible during my visit, I did appreciate their large selection of beer. They have a large draft list and an even larger bottle offering, making this a great place to enjoy a few drinks. Unfortunately, the one beer I wanted on draft that night wasn't available during my visit. However, I was able to find it in a bottle in their cooler. A couple of my friends ordered food and everything looked decent.   I would be willing to give this place another shot on a night that isn't so busy, which may affect the level of customer service."}
{"text":"I have gone too the Bottle Shop many times over the years. Sitting around the bar is nice, you have the bartender right there to open the beer you get from the cooler. But sitting at a table has never been a good experience. Tables are not cleared until you go sit at it and have to avoid touching someones used napkins, plates, and glasses. The waitress came to our table, refilled my drink, then saw another drink was empty and only refilled that glass while the other two drinks at the table were empty. She made 4 trips with 4 drinks.  The beer selection is great, the owner is a very nice guy, but the girls working there need to learn how to serve tables. They said they were sorry but it was busy, but they had 6 girls working the shop and it was not as full as it is during a Pens game."}
{"text":"Pretty girls.  Pretty awesome beer list.  Pretty awful food.  Pretty awful service.  Pretty low cut shirts and yoga pants."}
{"text":"I went to the Pittsburgh Bottleshop for the first time this past weekend. Overall the food was decently good but the restaurant itself isn't anything spectacular.   I had a shrimp po boy, which was on special that day and it was really good. I have no complaints about the food at all. But the service is a little bit...meh. I'll agree with other reviewers that it's apparent the waitresses are probably hired based on how attractive they are. A big hint of this is that the menu features more pictures of the smiling waitresses in tiny tank tops than it does of the actual food. I get that some places just operate this way, which is fine, especially for a sports bar. But I do wish the service was better. It took our waitress about 15 minutes to take our order. Then once we had our food she never checked back until we had already been done for ten minutes.   If you're in the area I'd say it's an a-okay place to stop for lunch or a few drinks, but it's definitely not a place I'd make a special trip for."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great if you're into that but for the rest of those who only go for liquor or wines the selection is about normal for an establishment this size and the prices perhaps a bit stiff unless you're there during happy hour.  A bunch of us went there as part of a get-together.  Our serve was nice and attentive, so that was a big plus knowing that the size and loudness of our party wasn't going to trigger slower service.  Both apps and entrees were ordered and by the end of the night all of our individual checks were correct, so that was awesome.  The food was good.  The beer was cold.  And the service was efficient.  Definitely would go back if I was in the mood for a beer, otherwise I would probably try something different just to get a more diverse set of food options."}
{"text":"This place sits back off the road in a little strip mall. From the outside it looks small but there's a lot of room to spread out and catch a game. Flat screens throughout give you a good view so you don't miss any of the action. The menu offers a nice selection of finger foods and entrees. Our table ordered nachos, fried zucchini, spinach artichoke dip, salad and wings. I'm not a beer drinker but they have large variety of it if that's your thing. Their frozen cocktails were yummy. The food came out fairly quickly, tasted good and prices fair for the quality and quantity.   I read complaints about the service but I didn't have a bad experience. The Steelers were playing and there was a bunch of people but the girls were working their butts off with a smile. On a side note, my squad pulled in the win so it was a good day. #gosteelers"}
{"text":"It's a sports bar in a strip mall...so right there it's a let down.  They make a descent drink and have a make your own six pack option to take out.  I have had a burger, ruben, wings, and mozzrella wedges in the 3 times I have been here.  All were just okay.  If you want to watch a game, eat some wings, and drink a beer I would pick elsewhere.  there are a lot better places for this in the South Hills area."}
{"text":"Three stars is described as \"A-OK\" and that is exactly how I felt about the bottle shop. I stopped here with three girlfriends to have a dinner to catch up. It wasn't clear when you walk in but since no one approached ups it seemed fine to seat ourselves. A waitress quickly came over and told us that while she wasn't our server, she would take our drink orders until our server could make it over. This was appreciated.   They have tons of drafts and bottles (obviously), but I went with the Bell's Oberon which was on special for $3, as I thought that was a good price. We had the Yuengling Beer Cheese dip as an appetizer. It was a little small but tasty. The pretzels were hot and fried and the cheese was tasty, though it could have been a bit hotter.   For my dinner I got the brisket sandwich, which was one of the chef's specials. It was tasty but nothing to write home about. The brisket was well prepared and not overcooked, but the bun was standard grocery store hamburger bun style and I think it had some cheddar cheese and LTO. Some BBQ sauce would have complimented it well but I didn't think to ask for any. The fries were tasty but a small portion (fine with me as that's already plenty of food but some people probably would have felt shorted).   After eating, we were still talking though confirmed to our waitress we didn't want any more drinks. She didn't rush us at all, which was cool, but checked back a few times. It seems like she wasn't sure when to ask if she should bring the checks. After about an hour, I went ahead and told her she could bring them and she brought them out promptly, and even split the appetizer without asking, which I loved.   I would come back if someone invited me but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I wanted to try their beer and have some food. They had a limited menu due to pens playoff game. It took server 5 minutes to wait on us then once she brought the drinks, another 15 minutes to take food order.   Their beer tasted like a typical kit beer....not too tasty.  We ended up not ordering food.   They used to have a huge bottle selection (hence the name). Now they tried to brew their own and it's not working (in my opinion).  They need to perfect their beers, maybe hire more people - and keep regular menu.  Servers were pretty nice."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about the bottle shop other than the selection of fine waitresses and beer options which explains why the place was full of mostly guys.  Food is standard bar fare- nachos, fries, and wings."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch a couple of times & food was very average for the price. It also took some time to get the food, which at that time, made me endure at least an hour lunch with some of the stiffest people I have even worked with & met in my life. Only talked about work.....I digress.  Fast forward to today, I went there for a couple of beers after work. Good lord, I like what I see. But, can you at least work for your tips by speeding up the service. Are these girls protesting?? Because it takes forever to get a drink. I drank 5 beers, I was as sober as I walked in as I was leaving. There is an attempt to try to make their own home brew, I didn't have it."}
{"text":"Beer is good...food is so so at best.  The service is about the same as the food. Mediocre"}
{"text":"The top attraction to this place seems to be the pretty waitresses.  No question, they are pretty.  But the food is also pretty good at a good price. Nice beer selection.  Try the Mixed Grill or Angus Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Went here after work on a busy evening, when you first walk in you can see a white neon glow from the right side wall that is actually a large beer cooler- it looks like you can just walk up and grab your own beer from the cooler-awesome! Had the special for dinner, stuffed peppers with red potatoes- it was decent, not out of this world good, just OK.  We also ordered the spinach dip- the 2nd place in PA that I tried the spinach dip and it just isn't that great, I am not sure what the deal is-  the price seemed a little steep to me for what you get, but then again I was just visiting the area so not sure if that is typical price for that part of town. Service was great, and the bathroom's were clean. this place was very busy though and really loud."}
{"text":"This place is a good place to stop on your way home from work to grab a beer or two.  The waitstaff is usually pretty friendly  The place is pretty big for being in a strip mall so bringing a group would be a nonissue."}
{"text":"When the first draft I tried to order was out, they immediately lost a star.  It looks like they have a lot of taps but the selection isn't the best.  There is a wall of coolers, though, so I eventually made my way over there for a few bottles.  We also ordered food, I had a turkey wrap and my friend a burger.  Food was average, not bad but not something I'd go back for.  I did kind of like the U-shaped bar surrounded by tables.  I was not a fan of the front wall of windows.    I had no complaints about the service however the menu cover is pictures of, I can only guess, their favorite patrons and pretty servers.  It didn't seem to go at all with the rest of the atmosphere, at least when I was there.  I can see it being a cool place to watch a game, but I don't really get that friendly neighborhood bar feel.  It's difficult to decide between 2 and 3 stars.  I mean, for the 2, yeah, I've experienced better and I don't think I'll go back.  But the 3 is A-OK.  I'm stuck in the middle but will post this review with 3 only because other than being out of my first draft choice, I did not have any other major complaints.  Pittsburgh Bottleshop needs to decide if it wants to be more upscale with better beer selections and menu entrees or more of a sports bar where it's okay to have Miller Lite on tap and lots of fried appetizer specials during Steelers games.  Right now it's somewhere in the middle, kind of like my rating."}
{"text":"Service : For being understaffed, the girls were working hard and pleasant. Giving it their all. I applaud that.  Beer: prices were fair and beer was cold.  Food: I had serious issues here. I got one of the daily specials... It was a gyro wrap. It came out after about 15 minutes, a fair and reasonable time. The fries were cold and obviously old. The wrap was missing the gyro sauce. I asked for some and got a little tiny cup of water-like gyro sauce. Their was enough meat on the entire wrap for about one good bite. The rest of it was all lettuce and tomatoes. I honestly had two bites on the meat part and it was gone. Unless I wanted a salad I was left very hungry. What a sad sandwich. Sorry I came hear for lunch. Will be my last time here when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  I've never eaten here but its a good place to grab a drink.  prices are decent."}
{"text":"This place was packed when we arrived. It was a cold night so we didn't want to sit by the door. Thankfully  we found a table at the opposite  side of the restaurant.   I got a generic cheeseburger  and it was good. My boyfriend had a turkey wrap. It was basic. I would like to try more food from there another day. They had a nice beer selection and they arrived shortly after we ordered.  I felt underwhelmed about this place but I would like to try it again, especially  since it was so busy, i must be missing something."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.   The restaurant has decided to move toward the micro brew route.  I sampled some of their beers.   I am not sure I like the new direction.     I miss the variety of beers I could get.   Their beers do have good taste, they are not at the maturity of some the items they no longer provide.  The service was on point.   The food was good.    I will definitely go back and hope that it grows on me."}
{"text":"Was told by the bartender after 7 beers over a 3-4 hour period while watching a steelerr game, that she was gonna start pacing me? Will never go back there, fries came out sorta slightly cooled off, and not hot."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  The Bottleshop used to be this unique place with an awesome beer selection.  My husband had lunch with his groomsman @ the BS the day of our wedding and we've taken out of town guests in the past... We hadn't been in about 6 months and wanted to catch the end of the Pens game after dinner with friends.  Let me just say, it'll be an even longer time before we return again.  The place was packed, which, at first, was good to see for a local business.  The waitress finally came over and took our order... she was so scantily clad that I was a little uncomfortable looking at her. The attitude just seethed out of her to the point where we felt as if our order was a bother to her.  Every time we turned around to try to find her, she was either flirting with the douche bags at every table around us or txting.    Aside from that, the beer selection has totally changed.  They used to have coolers lining the walls full of an amazing selection.  Now, their selection isn't far off from what you'd expect at, god forbid, an Applebees or TGI Fridays.  The food was never that great, but the beer selection and laid-back atmosphere made up for it.  Not sure what happened here, but pretty sure we won't be back."}
{"text":"Come look at our boobs...I mean, beer selection.   I've been to this place a bunch of times, but not since they remodeled, until yesterday. The bar looks great, but the restaurant is unbelievably neglected. Burned out overhead lights make the place seem like a dive. Easily the most filthy floor I have ever seen. Very hot waitresses that have no business waiting (they giggle a lot and say \"like, sorry I totally forgot that, he he\" way to often). Here was my dinner experience yesterday:  No lights on?! - The light from the dark day outside and T.V.s made me think I was going to sit next to an 80 year old woman chain smoking or a construction worker burping the alphabet.  Slip and Slide - The floor is disgusting. Worse than any dive in the city.squashed french fries, used napkins, spit, sticky booze, and the like. Slipped several times.  Hookers or Waitresses? - This isn't Hooters, but you wouldn't know it from the completely clueless staff with giant boobs, fresh fingernail polish and about 3 inches of cover up on their faces. Our waitress didn't know the specials and when we found it on the menu said, \"oh -- he he -- I didn't know that\". So much body spray, I smelled like her 2 hours later. Their menus are covered with photos of famous Pittsburgher's with these waitresses like they are cheap hookers. But it's okay because...  Every guy at the bar is a stereotypical douchebag. -  Baseball hats just a little askew to look cool, shell necklaces, perfectly white K-Swiss shoes and sleeveless button up dress shirts. All these guys did (about 50 of them) was drool over the waitresses and flirt drunkenly. Very loud and distracting.   Bar food or fine dining? - Bar food is average, very average. In the mood for Fillet Minion? They have it. The menu has everything, but its a mess. A joketastic mess. Also the menus are sticky torn and have many sauces all over them. Some interesting choices though and my wings were okay.  Beer - Tons in the bottle, but their taps are very lacking. As if saying we are to good for the city of Pittsburgh (this place is in Bridgeville, not the city of Pittsburgh), the have zero local beers on tap. In the real city of Pittsburgh, that is a sin.  The bill - 2 beers, three meals = $60=tip!!!!!! Crazy!!!!!! The attitude of this place goes as follows. \"Hey, we give you \"hot\" girls to look at and we have every dish ever created. And beer. So we can charge what we want because the average income in the area is over $65K a year. Did we mention the chicks? Hot chicks man!\"  Skip it...defiantly skip it!"}
{"text":"Acceptable food with horrible service. If you come here be ready to wait forever to get served."}
{"text":"I'm there most Fri nights with friends, always have a good time.  Good food (dry-rub Cajun wings are my favorite/usual), fun atmosphere, good service, friendly staff and great beer selection.  Plenty of TV's tuned in to sporting events.  Can get crowded weekend nights, but the girls almost always do a great job keeping up with everyone (like anywhere else when it's packed, they can get a little overwhelmed but generally handle it well)."}
{"text":"Waitresses are definitely hired for their attractiveness and one look at the menu will back that statement up.  Scattered among the typical bar food choices are glamour shots of the young ladies, occasionally with local celebs (read: Steelers).  It's really kind of funny.  Pretty to look at, but hit and miss on actual service and drink mixing ability.  However, this place is always buzzing with the Chartiers Valley locals.  A good people watching place to see folks you used to go to high school with.  Parking is plentiful and they are open until a decent hour, so it's a great alternative for locals who don't want to go \"dahntahn\", but want to mix with a crowd.    They play recorded music and have lots of flat screen TVs if there's a game on that you want to see.  It's been recently remodeled and expanded, so business must be good.  Wide selection of beer as the name suggests.  Lots on tap and plenty of bottles.  Apparently it's kind of a help yourself to the coolers for bottles then wait (and hope) for your waitress to come by and open it for you."}
{"text":"Good for guys as the waitresses are adorable. Food fair at best...bar food.  Lots of beers if you are a beer drinker.Decent place to watch a big game."}
{"text":"The weird online first dates continue.   This was suggested by a guy I met, and it seemed pretty nice from the outside. The dining area is nice, lots of TVs. But it's really loud. REALLY loud. I could barely hear this guy the whole night. I digress.   He ordered drinks, and I had a water. He seemed to enjoy his IPA, and we ordered a quesadilla. It was just okay. Chicken, cheese and what seemed to be canned green peppers. Their salsa was pretty good, though!   The server was rather non existent. Kind of disappointing. She would be there, and then be gone, before you could leave before you could say what you needed.   The dating game continues.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Food and beer was very good! The service sucks. You rarely see the server. And when you do you feel like you're bothering them. Cute behinds with horrible skills."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good food, spectacular scenery, but...the service is not up to par.  It may be as simple as adding an extra server or two.  Same goes with the bartender area."}
{"text":"Luckily they sell beer because you have to be drunk to think the food is worth throwing down your neck. How do you mess up nachos? Stale chips, pump cheese, canned diced tomatoes and run it through a deflavorizor. I've had better in a 7-11 in Newark. Had a veggie wrap that was nauseating. Why? Limp lettuce and bleached tomatoes. They got crazy exotic and threw in some hummus...so creative. If you are broke down and have no other option for eating, I vote starve and fondly remember any other meal."}
{"text":"My first visit here was to meet a date and this was a middle meet up point. I had scoped out the menu ahead of time (they do have a link for the daily specials, but that part of their website obviously hasn't been updated in a very long time).   As it is Good Friday, I assumed there would be Lenten specials & there were - my date & I shared Yuengling Beer Cheese with soft pretzel sticks, neither of us were overly impressed, but he got their Crab Bisque & said it was very good & crab in the bisque tasted fresh. I opted for cod nuggets & mac n cheese. The fish was good - the tarter sauce definitely was homemade & was tasty; the mac n cheese wasn't anything to write home about, but the beer selection's a good reason to check it out."}
{"text":"Whoa lots of choices! The craft beers on tap bring it all to life!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this place descriminates against the pale, non yoga pants wearers of the world when hiring waitresses unless tanning is a part of the uniform SO if you want to  attend a sausage fest trying to pick up bartenders check out the bottle shop. Otherwise decent food and beer selection."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here in the late afternoon for a drink or two and a meal. We found the selection to be great but the service and food were lackluster.   We wanted to give this place a fair shot after hearing so many mixed reviews but it took several minutes before we had a staff member even acknowledge us.   This bottleshop could be a great hangout for group and friends a like but it's anything but."}
{"text":"Let me just concur with most of the previous reviews...the food is not too bad and the service sucks. Our waitress either woke up on the wrong side of the bed or makes it her life mission to ignore people and act like a total b!$*#&. This place could have served the best food I have ever eaten in my life and I would never go back because of her. We were there as a very large party and pretty much the entire lot of us felt the same way. People don't frequent public places to get ignored and they certainly don't enjoy spending their hard earned money on someone who things they are entitled to a tip because they took an order. The bartenders were very nice to us so that was a good thing. The management really needs to do some training with their employees unless they enjoy never having repeat customers. The fries and wings were both very good. No military discount."}
{"text":"I've always liked stopping in at the Bottleshop. As for beer, their selection is hard to beat. And I have to say, I think the prices are pretty reasonable when you consider the selection carried.  Their food is pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. I would say it's a step above your average \"bar food\" menu, but it definitely isn't gourmet either. But with that being said, you get a good meal for what you pay for. I've never really been disappointed, just don't go expecting to rave about the food. But I've never complained about it either!"}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT, I love the food, but everytime I come, the service SUCKS.  it takes 20 minutes before we are even acknowledged.  Drinks take a while.  Takes another 20 minutes for food order.  Food usually comes out fast but we are NEVER checked on again.  No refills or other drinks. Turns into a 3 hour visit.  If it wasnt for the excellent food I wouldnt be coming back.  Maybe Ill just get carry out from now on since it has been like this the past 5 visits (I go monthly).  But I cant stress enough the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Two stars indicates \"Meh, I've experienced better,\" and sadly, that's about all that's necessary to say. The bottle selection that takes up one wall of coolers is great. The draft list isn't bad. The servers behind the bar were more interested in talking to each other, though if someone needed something, they were pretty attentive, at least to us sitting around the bar.  The food was..mixed. I had a Chicken Caesar Wrap and my chicken was a bit dry, though boyfriend said his Santa Fe Chicken Wrap was good. I brought a Philly Cheesesteak Hoagie to my father and he loved it.  Gotta say, they need to step up their fry game, hard core. You can tell their the kind that are kinda battered and double-fried and these were soggy and the crispy exterior was cracking."}
{"text":"I have had lots of great times here, most of the waitress ive dealt with at the place have made me feel like the nerdy kid asking the head cheerleader to dance. The food is allwase decent or amazing and the beer selection allwase gives me something new to try ; which for me says a lot because I go out of my way to find new beers"}
{"text":"I see a lot of complaints about service, but when I went our server treated us well.  The beer selection is fantastic and they don't mind you self serving out of the fridges when it's not crowded.  Loads of TV's for sports is another draw. The food is just okay.  I wouldn't go for the food, our appetizers were \"meh\", our sandwiches weren't worth it and my friends wings were bland and soggy.   Go for the beer."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection.  About 30 drafts and  it looks like hundreds of different type bottles (not really sure).  Waitress was terrible and even said so when we were paying.  Were is the management?  We had a large group and ordered several apps.  Took 50 minutes for the apps.  The wings are OK but about the time we were finishing the wings our waitress finally showed up with plates for everyone and napkins.  Not great to eat a wing and have no place to put the bone.  The nacho's came out cold with some of the worst cold soggy cheese. Meh.   Finally were asked if we wanted to order our meals and it took 45 minutes. Most just ordered some type of burger and most said it was well done, not the way it was ordered.  I chose the Santa Fe wrap and it was OK.  The place was so noisy, yea the football games were on.   So if you are not in a hurry or just want some beer this is an OK place."}
{"text":"Food was gas station warming light quality. Beer selection ok.  Chef is clearly a novice.  Bartenders are a solid 8-10. Liquor tastes watered down.  I have revisited this place several times and it's always the same."}
{"text":"I got a call Sunday morning from good friend (Jimmy is his name and he is the only friend of mine who looks like Jesus Christ) who I'd not seen in over a year.   \"You wanna meet me at the Bottleshop Cafe and we'll catch the Steelers?\"  I agreed, I pass this place daily on the way to the gym, but never stopped in. We met outside the place and walked in.  It's a huge place and great for watching games. Two giant projector TVs are on both sides of the bar and smaller HiDef TVs are everywhere, not a bad seat in the house. There are about 17 beers on tap including 6 pretty good IPAs, and about 150 types of bottled beer. I chose a terrific IPA, Route 113, and Jesus, er, I mean Jimmy ordered a Red Stripe Jamaican Lager. We sucked them down fast, and figured we better order something to eat.   Nice menu, the usual with some pretty amazing surprises thrown in to keep you on your toes. One of the surprises was fried duck wings, panko crusted and deep fried. I ordered the red pepper roasted hummus, served with warm pita points and a side of chopped purple onions, it was a nice crunchy topping for the smooth, garlicky, flavorful hummus. Friend Jimmy ordered the Big Texas Burger, a six ounce patty with two strips of applewood smoked bacon, cheddar, onion rings and something called Bottleshop sauce. Looked mighty tasty, even to a vegan. He had a side of smashed potatoes and a pickle.   Why only three stars? The service was sad. I had to ask our waitress three times for the check and when it did come it seemed awfully high. We did some quick arithmetic and discovered she charged us for three beers each when in actuality we each had two beers each. Padding the bill? No idea, honest mistake, no idea. Keep track of what you eat and drink here, you may save ten bucks on the tab."}
{"text":"My second trip to the Bottleshop...   I visited about 2 years ago over the holidays for a Steelers game and a birthday party.  Food was great...excellent service...great drink selection.  I was coming from Moon to meet some friends from Mt. Lebo so it seemned a perfect meet up spot.  I was nervous after reading newer reviews.  No need to be nervous!  Food was great!  Drinks were good.  Service was great!  Nice spring breeze coming in the open doors.  I had a fantastic mixed grill salad and everyone else was happy with theirs.  Nothing fancy, but good and reasonably priced.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"We usually enjoy coming here, but unfortunately this time was not an enjoyable experience. We waited 20 minutes on a night that was not busy at all to get our order started. She took half of our tables order and then forgot about the other half. Our food was cold. Our waitress also didn't split our check when it's obvious she should have asked so service took longer. We are never ones to complain or be needy, but this was one of the worst services we have had. Waitresses were also busy socializing and on their phones instead of waiting on customers. We will be going elsewhere in the future."}
