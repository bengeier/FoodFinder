{"text":"One of the best and authentic Sichuan restaurants in Mississauga.
Not too pricy either, but expect to wait a little bit during rush hours."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and all the tables were dirty, they had to search for a clean one for us to sit. 

Unfortunately they don't speak very good English, they are in Mississauga after all. 

You get a free soup dish if you order over $40 but it has nuts in it and our waiter didn't understand the question \"does this have nuts in it?\". It's a cold soup that's basically noodles floating in oil, told them to keep it. 

The food was quite sub par, goto the pho restaurant instead, same plaza."}
{"text":"I'm so naive, I though there were good Chinese restaurants in downtown Toronto. Lots of them. Not so, according to a Chinese acquaintance who has recently arrived here from Shangahi. To prove it, we made the trip to the Red Chili Sichaun Restaurant in Mississauga.

Also known by its Chinese name, Ba Shu Ren Jia, this is the sister branch of its better known location in North York. The food was stellar. 

No Sichaun meal is complete without Fried Chicken in Chili Oil: very hot for those that like it that way (including me!) and aesthetically gorgeous, succulent chicken pieces all but invisible for the riot of dried red chili's its served with. Also chili saturated is the Mapo Tofu, fondly referred to by my friend as the Exxon Valdez (after the notorious Alaskan oil spill) As the moniker suggests - its very oily! - but no less delicious for that. 

To cool your palette try the delicate pea shoots with garlic, dry sauteed  bitter melon or the onion pancake - and of course a glass or two of cold Tsingtao beer.

All in all: authentic, a bit of a trip, but oh so worth it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but service was crapppppp, like seriously crap. Waitress was rude and slow, you'd have to ask many times to get what you want."}
{"text":"The Sichuan cuisine gods are smiling down upon me.

Back in the day when I worked in Markham, the Ba Shu Ren Jia on Steeles was a regular lunch stop. Authentic ma la seasoning was a rare commodity, and this place had a treasure trove of peppercorn-laden goodies.

Since moving to Cali, my visits back to the GTA have left me on the west side, namely Mississauga. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I discovered that Ba Shu Ren Jia had set up a new place just off Hurontario!

I went with my old mainstay, the Chongqing chicken (diced chicken in dried chilis). The spice was certainly there, with a fair dose of numbing peppercorn. Not quite up to the level of the Markham restuarant's heyday, but certainly prominent enough to be recognized. Legit ma la is now in the Sauga!

Very happy that the proprietors have set up shop in the west end. Also happy that they have a varied menu so I can invite my non-Sichuan loving friends/relatives for a meal when I am in town. Nice looking place, and the iPad ordering system is very cool."}
{"text":"I'm a long time customer of red chillies but theservice I received today was appalling. 

I have been ordering sheshuan noodles for years and they have always arrived with thick fat noodles. Today my order showed up with a shanghai noodle. I called to let the manager know about the mistake. 

He told me I need to ask for the fat noodle which had never been an issue before. I explained that I would like to have the error corrected or my money back. He told me he would only do so if I returned the food that my family had already dug into (to serve to other guests?!)

We have already waited over an hour for the food to arrive and weren't about to wait another hour for someone to come pick up the noodles while the rest of the food gets cold. 

When I told the manager that he's lost a long time customer and I will not order from them again he said \"that's fine\" and hung up. 

I hope he thinks this review is \"fine\" as well."}
