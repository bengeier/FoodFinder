{"text":"My husband and I tried Global years ago and just returned last night for a impromptu date night. The service was great. We both had salads as our first course and they were simple and well put together. The bread was warm & fresh. My husband had the pork cheeks and I had the ravioli and both were very delicious and presented beautifully. The sauce on the ravioli was very tasty, but not too heavy. Our server informed us that due to some recent changes to the office buildings around them, they will be moving. We can only hope they move closer to our neighborhood so we can visit more often."}
{"text":"Love the location and the restaurant is beautiful.  Unfortunately the price point will limit how often we return."}
{"text":"I dined at this restaurant back in March and service was a big issue...bringing the wrong entree, cold food, not clearing plates, etc.  I decided to give them a second chance this past weekend however the service was just as woeful....including serving one appetizer and two of our entrees COLD. The chef came to apologize but it should really have been the waiter. In addition, we dined at 7 pm and the special was already sold out....there were only three other tables of diners at that time. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We were seated in the noisy bar area. Could not order from regular menu...only Queens Feast Menu.  Food was just ok...small portions.  Two members of our group asked for more bread at different times....it finally came with dessert.  Did not care for rhubarb/strawberry dessert...strawberry was bad.  Service was not good..only time we saw anyone was bringing dishes,  couple ordered soup and had to wait for spoons.  Have been at other location and was much better.  Just disappointed."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a non-descript office complex, betwixt some unsightly concrete parking structures in a part of town long-abandoned after normal business hours, you will find Global Retaurant. So unlikely is this location, that I swore my GPS had to be wrong as I was pulling up for dinner with a large work group. If you happen to be fleeing the authorities and want to grab a solid meal in the Charlotte area, this would be a good choice. Indeed, it would likely be one of the last places they'd look for you.

Global delivers outstanding, complex cuisine. Its brand of New American borders features some French accents, including some contributions from the former colonies. 

We were a large group and ordered off a set menu.
- appetizer tower: a little bit of the highlights: spring rolls (nondescript), tartare (good if you're into that) and pork belly (which was the star)
- endive salad
- diver scallops: this was outstanding. A difficult protein to get right, this was seared to perfection and served with a risotto cake, mizuna and a glaze. Great balance of flavors. I didn't try the duck, but apparently that was the hit.

Service was really good. We were 20+ people, and they got all the coordination right. Staff was knowledgeable about all the dishes and were attentive at all the right times. I really like how they explain all the dishes at the time of service.

My only knock about this place is the ambience. While I've always believed it's all the about the food, this location would seem to push that saying to the stress limit. Mentally, I just can't associate fine dining with desolate office parks... It works for a corporate group, but probably less for a date.

If I lived around here, I'd go back with a significant other but make this strictly a weeknight spot."}
{"text":"Nothing to be impressed about!! Upscale prices with mediocre food. The service was good and the restaurant was beautiful.  Sorry won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Global moved to downtown Pineville!  Pineville needed the livelihood and Global is such a great place for date nights, family dinners, casual and formal parties.  They have amazing dishes and a nice variety of weekly musicians. 

I absolutely love Tuesdays for music, half price bottles of wine, and great times getting to know the staff & chef while having a girls night!  Give it a try!  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Tries too hard to be special; as a result, the servings are tiny and the pairings odd. ( nothing goes with grits flavored with faux smoke ) We were there during restaurant week, so I would have thought they would bring their A game."}
{"text":"Business dinner and everyone went away happy. The She Crab soup was outstanding. Between the four of us we had the sea bass, steak and pork belly. We all loved the meal. The wine was nice and the pricing was fair. Very quite so we had plenty of opportunity to talk shop without being bothered.   Seems like a hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had the esteemed honor of working for Chef Bernard during the opening of his new location, and I can safely say I have not met anyone more entitled and arrogant in my adult life. I worked for two weeks without pay, after being promised compensation, putting together the tables you sit at during your foray into what may be the most banal dining experience in all of Charlotte. The man, and his wife, scare away talented and well meaning people as if it is very rapidly going out of style. The grill chef Corey is one of the most bush league cooks in fine dining I will have the displeasure of working with, don't be surprised if your entree is overcooked.
The playlist will play advertisements during service, so perk up your ears, as no one seems to notice, over the modern drivel. I think an establishment such as this must only attract the tone deaf and senseless, seeking any place which doesn't serve biscuits. The cost of food is atrocious, for a 3 dollar portion of ribeye or duck you will be charged 30 dollars, a brazen display the infinite nerve and sense of grandiose delusional entitlement of this place and owner. Speaking of place, it is oddly situated by some rail road tracks in a row of mind numbing antique stores, which actually is perfect, nevermind. The décor is sickeningly modern in a turn of the century building. Clueless people completely out of touch with anything than acquiring your money. I don't think there is much of a love of anything else. While employed there frequently we would be scolded for ruining their dream, which in all reality is a nightmare. It has two floors and the service staff has to truck your food and dirty dishes up and down all night, because, who doesn't love a sweaty faced server when you are paying 30 dollars a plate. And a dumb waiter was out of the question, because the owner was swindled out of a large portion of the building costs by someone who maybe dealt the blow which was coming to these utterly draconian owners/usurious crooks. Notice the plywood which was painted dark grey to hide the fact that it's cheap plywood at the bar. This place is all show, and it doesn't take more than a visit to recognize the fact it's vacuous and hollow at its core. I will never work for someone again who has such utter contempt for those who toil for him, and as he approached me to work for him, and never gave any respect to the fact that I worked for him for nothing to make this nightmare come true, it was a tumultuous bitter life lesson. Oh, and there are cockroaches. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Have been to Global 4 to 5 times now and it is consistently good. Very unassuming location (in an office park off of Johnson Rd. on 485) but they make the best of it. Great service that seems like side jobs for local Johnson & Wales kids (who else would be able to describe the cooking method for each entree that descriptively? Maybe... I don't know). Chef covers many different cuisines, hence the name, but seems to do best with creations of his own (try the pork belly if it is ever on the menu). Worth the trip. Decent to above average wine list."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner. Do not recommend. Food was okay but uninspired and unimpressive. Wine list is extremely limited and narrow is scope...they had one Pinot Noir. 

The decor was equally uninspired, it felt somewhat run-down. Tinny piped music, worn tablecloths and chairs could all be overlooked if the food was better. 

The chef spoke to our table, unfortunately. While clearly knowledgeable about his menu, he did not have a very good tableside manner, and the server was clearly uncomfortable when he spoke to our table. 

On the positive side, the martini was very good, and service was excellent.

Overall mediocre in terms of food, wine, and atmosphere. Unless you are stranded in Ballantyne or a hotel within walking distance, there are far better places in Charlotte to experience this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"Wow.  Love the new location! 

We just came in for drinks and apps at the bar. Hannah the barterer was so nice and friendly. Started with the Global Julip which was wonderful. -- gin, cucumber, lim, mint & club soda. It was so refreshing on a hot day. 

My favorite Bar Bite was the Berkshire Pork Belly. It was out of this world! It had a cucumber relish and pickled ramps. 

Already planning our next visit. 

Thank you for a great night and wonderful food."}
{"text":"If you have not experienced Global.....GO! The food and service is impeccable!!! Sooo good."}
{"text":"My brother got me a $40 gift card for Global Restaurant off LivingSocial.com. So, I had no choice but to heck this place out.

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience! Aside from being in a business park, the ambiance was nice and the inside was well decorated. The food was good and I couldn't have eaten much more after an appetizer and main course. The prices weren't too bad as well.

My only complaints: The waiter obviously didn't know too much about the food, he kept stumbling over his words while describing the dishes. Also, one of the employees had brought there kid as he kept running around. It was quite annoying but I am not a big fan of kids."}
{"text":"Went with my better half for a birthday dinner on a recent early sat evening.
Having worked at a large fish market throughout high school and college I have a pretty good idea of what is prepared correctly and what is not.  I ordered the seared sea bass, And have to say it was one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly and was delicious.
Highly recommend that and would definitely order again.  My wife had the sweet potato ravioli which was also good.  We both had the lobster bisque which although had a nice flavor  had not a morsel of lobster in there.
Overall the meal was excellent and will def be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit hard to find on its own since it's in the middle of an office park, but there were plenty of directional signs to guide you along the way.  This is definitely a neighborhood gem.  We went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was perfect for a nice quiet romantic dinner.  Portion sizes were perfect, not too small nor too large.  We shared the Moroccan Delight for an appetizer, then had the Paella and Pork Tenderloin.  We ended dinner with the Nougat Glace, which was well worth the calories!  The chef even came out and spoke to every table to ensure everybody's dinner was perfect.  Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. Loved the Pork-belly appetizer!! Had the luck to order from a brand new menu. Had the sea scallops, very tender and the rissotto \"patty\" was awesome! My girlfriend had the duck breast which was juicy and tasty. We ordered a bottle of French red and we drank it all! The service was very good and the chef/owner came out to greet us and was very nice. Love a restaurant with a socializing chef . Def part of the Global family."}
{"text":"This is the Charlotte area's best kept secret. Global Restaurant is our favorite! The food is fantastic, the waitstaff is great and Chef Bernard is personable, as well as being the best in Charlotte! We can always count on the food to be perfect. It's our \"go to\" restaurant for taking clients and friends from out of town. Don't forget to check out the special wine dinners Chef Bernard hosts. They're out of this world!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere.  Server recommended the starters and main course including the wine.  It was perfect."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed an amazing 6 course food and wine pairing dinner at Global recently.  Chef Bernard went above and beyond to prepare an innovative, exciting and very delicious dinner.  He took extra special care to make the evening a memorable one.  I would recommend this restaurant without a doubt, special occasion or not, it will be a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Global on multiple occasions such as Restaurant Week, New Year's, Special Night on the town and EVERYTIME the food has been fantastic.  The menu is always seasonal with local farm fresh produce.  I don't understand some of the reviews on Google questioning location? Many (myself included) take pride when they find a hidden gem in the neighborhood and are able to tell friends about the great food...it seems like this \"word of mouth\" marketing is working because the restaurant was packed the last time visited on New Year's. In my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in all of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a pleasing small town setting.

Only negative was uncomfortable downstairs chairs.

Would definitely go again.

{"text":"My first visit was last Saturday night ,I pass this restaurant 2xaday and always wanted to drop in . Well the perfect time came and how glad I did . It was a pure joy from my first step in the door to my last step out the door . First what struck me was how beautiful the interior was , then a great bottle of wine and the a most wonderful salad and what a great entre of the duck . I ate it all and wasn't ashamed when my plate was cleaned . Why would I have left any of the best food I have had in the 7yrs of living in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and go to this wonderful place Great for date nights And the most welcoming owners .... 
Don't miss it !!!!"}
{"text":"We dined the last night of restaurant week(which we didn't know until we arrived). The menu was very limited, the appetizer of pork bellies(my husband's) was so greasy he couldn't eat it, his entree was cod and very bland. My entree, sea bass was overcooked and tasted bland and not very fresh.  The only part of the meal that we liked was the dessert.

This was our first time here for my birthday and was very disappointed considering all the great reviews.  Was this any off night, maybe but will probably not go back. One positive was our waiter-very knowledgable and friendly."}
{"text":"Came during Queens Feast.
So far I've had a glass of chianti with an heirloom caprese salad with fresh  mozzarella. Magnificently done! 
So they have this cream cheese butter and fresh strawberry spread for the fresh baked bread... 
So about this pasta... 
Fresh Campanelle Pasta
Tomato conserve - basil pesto - Pecorino  Romano cheese. 
THERE IS CRACKED BLACKED PEPPER MADE IN THE PASTA DOUGH! ?
Dining is not complete with out dessert. Think deconstructed peach cobbler... flame broiled braised peaches with a dulce de Leche cinnamon flavored crema served in a double shot glass and baked pie crust strip."}
{"text":"Chef Bernard has a creative and appetizing menu with regular specials that are unique and delicious. Many traditional favorites as well. Great service and friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. Good wine selections. Can recommend with confidence."}
{"text":"I have dined with Chef Bernard over 10 times and it never fails to be like a new first time.  What makes it so special are several things:  1) the food is just fantastic, 2) the wait staff have been there for a long time and know the food and wine/cocktail offerings like a best friend, and 3) Chef comes out of the kitchen to visit the tables and see how you are enjoying everything - and actually deeply cares what you think.  

I've taken friends and clients 4 times this spring and have had most of the appetizers and many of the main courses.  I personally enjoyed the Butternut Squash Ravioli with shrimp, the Veal Tenderloin, the Divers Scallops, and the Paella, and have had tastes of the Sea Bass, Duck, and the Mahi.

My favorite appetizers are the Shrimp Ooh La La and the Pork Belly (to die for!), and the She Crab Soup is a must (being from Charleston I did not believe it could be as good as it is...but it is).

Let the wait staff make wine recommendations.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good here and the atmosphere is laid back which makes a great date night or chill spots with friends. You are instantly transformed into a different atmosphere with classy upscale place to the point you almost forget you are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"An experience that is exquisite! We had a party of 7 and started out with the galette, pork belly and tortillas. Wow, what a start. The entrees ordered at our table included the rib eye, pork tenderloin, prosciutto mac and cheese, and a gourmet burger. No food was left behind because it was so delicious.  We ended the meal with a variety of desserts which did not disappoint!  The menu is not overwhelming and the plate combinations are superb. The service is impeccable with the servers being very knowledgeable about the menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While on a business trip, I stumbled upon Global Restaurant while literally riding around looking for a local place to have dinner. Wow, what a great experience. I loved the atmosphere as soon as I entered.  The staff was friendly and extremely accommodating, but what prompted me most to write this review was the food. I had their Baby Lettuce Mix and Cabbage Roll with Butternut Squash.  It was a culinary experience, simply incredible.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Global is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The food is always amazing and the service is 200%."}
{"text":"My husband has wanted to eat here for two years now. We finally made but we will not be making a second trip. If you are hungry make sure to eat beforehand, since the portions you are served here are incredibly stingy and overpriced.  We started with the shrimp appetizer and got only 3 moderately large shrimp for $12. Not enough to share for sure. My husband ordered the W& D Mushroom ravioli and there were 6 raviolis for $22."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I went with my fiance and a group of friends for a birthday celebration and waited for almost 2 hours for our meal. I had the ribeye which was just ok and my fiance ordered the lamb pave, that she couldn't eat it because the meat was very chewy and the curry rice bland and hard. Worst dish I ever tried to be honest. Unfortunately no one at the party was happy with the meal and service.

I really wanted to like the place, which is nice by the way, but I won't come back again"}
{"text":"Tucked off the beaten path in Ballentyne is this little gem. Would never have known about it had it not been for the Charlotte Citipass coupon...this little book has been a harbinger to many a great dining experience. 

One of the few fine dining restaurants in Charlotte that attempts to step outside the boundaries of normal gastronomy. The words \"safe, unambitious\" will not appear as adjectives to describe any of the three dishes I consumed during my wife's birthday dinner. I began the adventure with the chefs soup Du jour, Braised Boar and Rice Soup. Fantastic starter, if a bit on the salty side. I've never been afraid of a little sodium, so I consumed every last drop. 

For a main course, I again chose one of the chefs specials; Duck Breast, with a cauliflower puree, bean puree, broccoli rabe, finished with a honey gelee (read: honey jello). Now, I'm not usually one to fall all over themselves for kitchen gimmickry (i.e. honey jello squares garnishing the plate, purees of this and that, finished with an emulsion of blah blah, etc.); I prefer to let the locally grown ingredients (which this place boasts) speak for themselves. However, in this instance, I was pleasantly surprised at how all the flavors played off one another. The insanely bitter-but-delicious Broccoli rabe, paired with the sweet honey and savory fatty duck, was sublime. My only critique would be the two purees on the plate (albeit very delicious purees). Fortunately, the crunch of the lightly sauteed broccoli and crispy skin of the duck breast swooped to the rescue with just enough texture to save the dish from becoming a plate of baby food accoutrement. 

For desert, I always play it safe. If a menu declares creme brulee, then creme brulee I do order. I don't know what it is about this simple, delicious vanilla custard that commands my attention. Being a purist, I prefer the vanilla bean creme brulee over other variations, but Global forced me outside of my traditional boundaries (just as they had with the two previous courses) by serving me a trio of brulees; a mocha and a chocolate brulee accompanied my vanilla go-to. And I was happy to have the experience! Chef Bernard came out at the conclusion of the meal to make sure everything was to our liking.  This little touch is lost in today's culinary world, but greatly appreciated by myself and my fellow diners.

I hope this place makes it; an odd location in a seemingly abandoned business park, coupled with the menu being prohibitively expensive for many a dining budget, will make it challenging. Fortunately, I believe that Chef Bernard (executive chef) and his wife Shannon (front of the house) are up to the challenge!"}
{"text":"I had always driven by this place and wanted to stop in.  I finally did last Friday evening.  I was alone and sat at the bar to have some drinks and dinner.  It took a while before anyone acknowledged me.  The lady behind the bar was busy chit chatting with another couple.  After I was finally acknowledged i asked for a drink/wine list and ordered a glass of wine.  Looking at the menu, as usual in a lot of places, there are not many vegetarian choices.  I ordered the cheese plate which I was very excited about (until i received it) and what i thought was BEET tartar.  
When my food came the cheese plate was little to be desired.  There were 4 kinds of cheeses, but not enough of each to even put on a saltine cracker.  While it was delicious, way too small portions for the $15 price.  and the BEET tartar i was excited about turned out to be BEEF instead.  I looked at it, thinking \"this doesn't look like Beets\" and looked on the menu to see if maybe the bartender misunderstood me but there was no other dish on the menu called Beef tartar that i saw... so I stupidly took a bite.  It was Beef!  I just ate a poor dead cow!
I finished my smidgen of cheeses before anyone ever came back to check on me and asked the bartender what i was served.  I told her the menu said BEET.  She showed me the menu and the one i had was printed badly and the letters of the BEEF/BEET were cut off, making it look like BEET... Then she showed me the other menus and said \"See, it is BEEF!\"  Which was much more legible on the other menus.  
She offered to give me some fried avacado instead, which I accepted because I was still quite hungry after my $15 cheese plate.  But rather than arguing with me and proving  her point to me by showing me other menus ... she had no idea what it was like for a vegetarian of 20 years to eat beef.  She was not understanding or compassionate of the situation whatsoever and made it into my fault.  
After finishing my wine I asked for my bill and left.  That is not a place i will ever go to again - and reading other negative comments from other customers reinforces my opinion even more."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Bad service.  We left after only being served cocktails during our 1 hour wait.  No bread, no salad, no service.  Never had a chance to try their food.  I mentioned it to Shannon a co-owner, she seemed not to care.  But they sure like selling drinks while you wait for no service.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu, we had no other choice.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  We were offered cocktails 3 times, we still had cocktails yet they still tried to sell us more."}
{"text":"It sounds good on paper - but the execution isn't there.  Would be much better if they stuck to one cuisine they did well, instead of trying to make each dish based on a different region."}
{"text":"The gourmet burger itself deserves 5 stars.  I'd ordered it medium and it was definitely medium well but it was still juicy and the bacon jam did not disappoint.  My husband however was very disappointed with his boneless short ribs.  Minus the pickled carrots there was no flavor and it left him hungry.  Lastly, the service wasn't anything to write home about.  We noticed a much better camaraderie from the servers with the locals and felt like they honestly couldn't have cared less about us."}
{"text":"I really hate posting this because I normally don't write reviews but Global really disappointed me. It's one thing to make people wait more than an hour (2 hours in our case) for a meal but it's another not to recognize that your customers were upset. We literally left our desert uneaten and left our appetizer on the plate because it was served cold. Our waitress seemed extremely shy and not attentive. The chef did come out and speak with us and said they would work on the issues in the future but really did not apologize or offer to remove the plates from our bills. I really wanted this restaurant to be good. I like the atmosphere and location but I cannot stand poor customer service. Every restaurant makes mistakes, the key is to recognize them and to keep your customer coming back. In my case, this restaurant do not meet our expectations."}
{"text":"First time dining at Global Restaurant.  Enjoyed the cafe style dining out front and the food was wonderful!  Definitely a \"must try\"!"}
{"text":"An incredible gem in of all places, Pineville!  Food compares with the best of Charlotte or anywhere else for that matter.  If you love great food, you need to check it out.  The downstairs is more casual and has a pub like atmosphere (although upscale).  Upstairs is fine dining which is where we sat for our meal. A separate review talked about how great the burgers were so we plan on checking that out next.  We plan on making this a regular spot and intend to bring family and friends at our next opportunity."}
{"text":"I waited to review this restaurant, until we had the pleasure of trying both the Upstairs (more elegant dining) and the Downstairs (more casual dining). We have now tried both and have enjoyed it throughly. The new location is much better than the former, where they are accommodating for either of your dining needs (elegant or casual).

We celebrated my wife's birthday upstairs and it was wonderful. We each (3 of us) had 4 courses and everyone loved their dishes. The waiter was excellent, was engaging, knowledgeable about the menu, personable but not to much. We came back a week later and sat outside, and along with the rest of the appetizers that we enjoyed, we had the best burger we have ever had. 

We love good food, I am not one for over the top presentations. The food may look good but does it taste good? And it did INDEED! Well done!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Global!  I love the fact that you call and can easily reach the owner to discuss reservations, specials, etc.  He constantly is searching for new dishes for his menu and new specials and has a VERY knowledgeable waitstaff that give great advice on wine selections, food selections, etc.  I also like the fact that I haven't seen any noticeable turnover in the waitstaff in the years that I've been going.  It has an incredible \"comfy feel\" to the restaurant and great ambiance.  Mike K."}
{"text":"Well where do I start this restaurant is one not to be missed..........The interior is so beautiful and was done with real class. Now the bar was welcoming and having arrived before my date I was treated so nicely when My date came we started to chat then ordered a bottle of wine with the help of Shannon the owner still chatting we decided that where we were was co convertible that we stayed at the bar had our meal which was GREAT mine the Duck ,his the Diver Scallops after dinner drink and we ended up having such a great time we closed the place and on top got a tour of the restaurant from the other owner Bernard....Can Not say enough really good things about our first time not last to Global ...Don't Miss out ."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte and a true \"hidden gem.\"    Global is an ideal place for a special occasion, romantic night out, or a business dinner.  We were just there for our 10th anniversary and had a fabulous experience,  When we sat down we were given complimentary champagne to help us celebrate.  Every course was delicious.  We had a cheese plate and shrimp for appetizers.  Our main entrees were sea bass and lamb.  Both perfectly cooked and plated very nicely.  The desserts were excellent, too.  While the food is high-end, Global is very reasonably priced with no entrée more than $30.  If you live in the Ballantyne area or are staying at one of the area hotels you need to put this great restaurant on your list of places to try.

By the way, it is really hidden.  It is behind the Earth Fare/Red Robin shopping plaza in the Torringdon Way business area just North of 485 off of Johnston."}
{"text":"I wish I had pictures to share of the many spectacular meals we have had at Global but they were all so great that we dug in before snapping a photo. We have been loyal customers of Global ever since they were in their prior location in Toringdon. Each and every time we have had impeccable service and the BEST food! Their menu changes often but with all of the dishes we have tried, we're pretty sure you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"The bar area is nice with good service.  We only ordered drinks but they were served quickly.  We got seated upstairs in the dining room and things quickly changed.  Our waiter was friendly but the service was horrible.   We ordered our food and it literally took an hour and half for it to come and that wasn't even the main course, it was the soup and salad. There is no reason that should have taken that long. In addition the waiter never came over to apologize unless we called him over. The restaurant wasn't incredibly busy either.  When our entrees came they were cold, over cooked, and tasted bad. Unfortunately we won't be going back."}
{"text":"On Thursday nights we go to Kit's Trackside Crafts for music bingo in downtown Pineville. We usually eat dinner first at the Corner Grind. Unfortunately a couple of weeks ago a drunk driver drove through their front window so they are closed for repairs right now. The only other restaurant that was available on main street was Global Restaurant. We decided to walk down and get food to go to take back to the bar with us for music bingo. We walked in and no one greeted us. The hostess stand was empty. There was a bartender behind the bar but he didn't really acknowledge us. Eventually we wandered over to the bar and sat down and told them that we would like to order food to go. They were mildly friendly which was a plus after having no one greeted us when we walked in the door. The prices were out of this world outrageous! So we ordered just a few appetizers to go because really it was the only thing we could afford compared to what we usually eat on Thursday nights.  My husband eats low-carb so there were not very many options for him. He ended up ordering wings because that was basically all he could get.  I ordered a cheese plate and spinach artichoke dip with wonton chips. Our friends placed their own order which was just two cups of soup. We proceeded to wait an ungodly amount of time for our food to be ready. I'm pretty sure it took about 45 minutes to get our meager order cooked and bagged up and ready to go. It seems preposterous because there was hardly anyone even in the restaurant. I don't know why it took so long. The whole reason why we went to Global was because we were too hungry to wait for food to be delivered by door dash. We would have been better off doing that in the end. We took our food and went back to Kit's. When we unboxed our food, we were beyond disappointed. None of the containers were full. The dip barely filled half the cup and the wonton chips were extremely greasy. My husband's 8 wings didn't even come with celery. But, the kicker was the cheese platter. It cost $15 and it was the saddest cheese platter I have ever seen in my life. It looked like leftovers from a cheese platter that a previous group had already demolished. The Corner Grind also has a cheese platter and it only costs $12 and has 3 times as much food on it. I will attach the saaaad photo. These meager offerings ended up costing us $40!!  And, we were still hungry!!  Don't bother with Global Restaurant."}
{"text":"Last night, I tried Global Restaurant Bar & Lounge on the recommendation of a friend. The food was very unique, creative and succulent. Our waiter was excellent and was exceedingly knowledgeable about the menus and wine. My wife is a food snob and raved about her food. She is happy, I am happy."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants in all of charlotte. This place is a hidden little gem. Hands down it is creative, unique and always we'll executed.  For those looking for a culinary adventure this is definitely your stop. Mmm... Oh and the wine is good too!"}
{"text":"This is a nice cozy atmosphere with dim lighting, it would be great for a quiet date night. I attended for the first time during Restaurant Week. As a disclaimer everyone should expect delays during restaurant week. A restaurant can go from 5 reservations on Tuesday to 30 during restaurant week. It is an adjustment. We were a party of 4. The bartender was good, be sure to ask for the liquid sunshine :). We met the owner and she was very pleasant. I enjoyed the saffron papperdelle pasta which was seasoned very well and the collard greens added extra texture.  We were able to sample each others food and the steak medallions were cooked properly but I wish there was more coffee crust on them. The carrot-ginger soup was not heavy on the ginger, which I liked. The macaroni and cheese could have used more cheese sauce, it was not as creamy as I would like. But it had a good flavor. Overall I enjoyed this place and the location. My group will come back after restaurant week."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, food was delicious, and service fantastic! One of Charlottes hidden secrets! Located in the town of Pineville parking is easy and you get to avoid the downtown Charlotte traffic. Chef Bernard stop by our table personally to thank us and ask us how we enjoyed the meal...not too often in a big city do you get to meet the chef...and his wife. Personable, impeccable and worth it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in during Restaurant week - not knowing and not wanting a big meal.  The staff sat me down and made some appetizer suggestions that I took and were phenomenol...absolutely delicious!!!!  Try the Pork Belly appetizer - it is truly sublime.  I paired it with the pickled peach salad and am still savoring the flavors........"}
{"text":"Much better since they moved. Waiter was one of the best
I thought the desserts were a little flimsy for the price, but we had a lovely eating"}
{"text":"Just an overall great experience. Being from Chicago we are really spoiled by great restaurants but this one can definitely hold its own. Loved everything about it, especially meeting the owner/chef after dinner when he came to check on our meal! Great time, best meal in town."}
{"text":"Been to Global twice since the move & both meals were 5 star. Service was 5 star as well. The most recent during CLT Restaurant Week. New location has a cool vibe versus the bland Torrington Office Park locale."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions and really like it. It is a small and intimate place with wonderful servers, great food, and a nice wine list.  It is a bit odd that this nice resturant is tucked away in a corporate park rather than being in a center with a mix of retail and restaurants, but it works nonetheless. 

I love the Shrimp \"Ooo La La!!!\" which is flash fried & tossed in a sweet & sour Papaya vinaigrette. And, we also love the Diver Scallops as well as the Sea Bass. Since we both love Crème Brulee, we usually go for the Trio of Crème Brulee  - delish!! 

The restaurant is a little pricey but worth the splurge. Also, we have been when they have participated in Restaurant Week -- or  when they have offered fixed price specials.  This is a nice way to try Global for the first time, because you get a choice of selected appetizers, entrees, and desserts for a fixed price."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Not many in the Charlotte area South of 485. Sophisticated but somehow down to earth. Worthwhile!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Global Restaurant last week, although it had been on our \"to try\" list for quite some time.  Good things come to those who wait -- our experience was fabulous.  The restaurant was not too crowded on a weeknight, so we were seated in the more casual downstairs venue.  It still felt like a nice night out.

My husband ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi and gave me a taste.  It had a very nice taste and texture that was brightened by the orange in the mascarpone crema. I ordered the Diver Scallops and was not disappointed! The kohlrabi slaw provided a nice counterbalance to the creamy scallops and the house siracha gave a nice punctuation to the plate without being overly spicy.

As others have mentioned, Chef Bernard did make an appearance at our table to ensure that we were enjoying our meal.  All in all -- it was a delicious treat!"}
{"text":"Global is fine dining in a gorgeous, yet casual setting. My husband and I first tried Global during Charlotte Restaurant Week and have been back several times now. The food is outstanding! The menu is thoughtfully planned, and not overwhelming like so many other establishments. The cocktail list is a work of art! Everything we have tried has been mixed to perfection. 
The staff at Global is always delightful. It is apparent that management hires and trains with the highest expectations. 
On our last visit, owner/Chef Bernard visited our table to ensure we were pleased. He was so warm and genuine. 
We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Service at this establishment was awful and the meal was barely average. We went for Charlotte Restaurant Week and Global put adders on to the menu choice prices instead of following the advertised prices. This is definitely not worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Friday night 7pm restaurant was completely empty,  never a good sign for me.  

#1 if you hungry and looking to eat lots, this is not the place for you.

#2 prices are a little high 

#3 food was good and I do recommend dessert."}
{"text":"Went here for a restaurant Week and it was a pleasant surprise. I never even knew he restaurant was there because it is in corporate building. The food was great. We had the shrimp ooh la la which was excellent and the NY strip. The chef came out and greeted us which was nice. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"First time here. But not the last time.....First off, the wait staff is excellent! Very professional and friendly. He made some recommendations, and we opted for the Pork Belly and She Crab Soup. Both were excellent! She Crab soup was outstanding, with delicious chunks of crab and the cream added was just the right amount. Pork belly....I mean it's PORK BELLY! Thick bacon cut with lentils so it was YUMMY!

My date got the Scallops and I got the Paella. Both were really good. Her scallops were better than my Paella, but don't get me wrong, the Paella was really good! It's just that I'm spoiled when it comes to Paella. Cafe Ba Ba Reba in my hometown of Chicago and Segovia's in Toronto really ruined it for me when juding Paella! Nonetheless, Global's Paella was good.

The dessert. OMG! Their Nougat Glace was phenomenal! Very classic French presentation and preparation. It's basically a very light ice cream, but so much better! I'd highly recommend this if you come here!

Overall a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Very nice menu, excellent service, willingness to accommodate multiple dietary restrictions, and a lovely visit from the owner and executive chef.  Location is a little off the beaten path in Pineville, but a very worthwhile excursion."}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice and the food was decent, but the atmosphere and service is lacking."}
{"text":"We had an incredible time when we visited Global Restaurant. The food was full of flavor, fresh, and was wonderfully presented. The best part was chatting it up with the Chef and his lovely wife. We had such a great experience and I can't wait to get back for another visit!"}
{"text":"We've discover this place in yelp and let me tell you - the best choice in Pineville area by far!! Amazing place, ambiance and food. If you are looking for a good drink and french tapas style cuisine this is your best option. Now has become a place to go for us on a weekend. Also, live nice old country elegant music. Can't be better than this. Super recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to find this gem of a restaurant tucked in downtown Pineville! Amazing food, atmosphere and location. We stopped in on a Friday and there was a very talented singer performing, the staff was so friendly and thoughtful and to top it off the food was AMAZING! Authentic, fresh and quick to order, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the \"best\" Restaurant in Charlotte!  Every meal I have had here has been extremely memorable in the best possible way!  The She Crab soup is so good it is hard not to eat the bowl.  The pork belly appetizer is so good you feel like you should go into the kitchen and shake everyone's hand.  Every entrée I have ordered has been special.  I am from California and if this place was in San Francisco it would cost twice as much and have a two month long waiting list.  I saw another reviewer say that the place was not crowded and that was never a good sign???  Chile's is packed every night and the food is garbage.  Do yourself a tremendous favor and eat here once before you die.

{"text":"Cute little place right in downtown Pineville. I ordered take out while attending an art workshop a few doors down. 

The white bean spread and cheese plate were really good however I would bet money it would have been better in the restaurant. 

I would give 5 stars but I'm not due to the uneasy feeling/vibe I received when I enter to pick up my order. Not sure if they were busy, not equipped for take out but I felt out of place in this very clean lines modern environment. I will try them again during restaurant week as the menu looks delicious"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Global and decided to try it for Restaurant Week.

The location is a little odd. But the staff seems super friendly and knowledgeable.  My waitress was exceptional. 

I drank the Malbec that was available by the glass and it was superb. 

I started with the Pork Belly. It was very well composed which is nice in a dish that can get by on it's decadence. The belly, itself, was perfectly prepared. Pickled vegetables added an excellent acidic and textural component. The spicy mustard topping added an interesting bite.

The Entree was a pork chop with root vegetables and herb potato gnocchi with a fig reduction sauce. The pork was well cooked and seasoned. The root vegetables were out of this world. They conveyed a sense of warmth (but not spicy) and home. The gnocchi was great with a little char that added flavor and texture but no bitterness.

The Smore dessert was rich and lovely. Capturing the childhood flavors and refining it to the adult pallette. 

Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Great food...quiet atmosphere...definitely a good date place, esp on Valentines Day.

I had the W&D Mushroom Ravioli...Belgian endive salad...both very good. 

The vegetarian options were clearly marked (definite plus in my book!)"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were delicious. The staff was very friendly. We enjoyed the cozoness of the restaurant. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"We love Global restaurant.  We have gone a few times and everytime  we go the food is phenomenal! The chef is very nice and professional. We refer all our friends  to Global if they want a special night out. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We drove through town on our venture between Charleston and Greensboro. We were very impressed with both the dinner and wine selections. We will make sure stop here again! If you are thinking of giving it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant! I have been dining with them for the last 9 years and love the new location in Pineville. Great food and atmosphere. They have a bar area and outdoor seating if you want to be more causal or dining room for more formal affair."}
{"text":"If you can find it you won't be disappointed.  The service was impeccable and the food was outstanding.  Good wine list and eclectic tasty food.  I will withhold the 5th star to see if they can perform with a full menu rather than the restaurant week one they served tonight."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal at Global last night, Valentines Day. The meal event was 4 courses, each presented with a wine pairing. The wine selection for each dish was spot on; an Albariño for the lobster ravioli, a Pouilly-Fuisse with the stripped bass, a Cabernet with the melt in your mouth veal osso buco, and a ruby Port with the delicious opera cake.  The memory of this wonderful meal and the company it was shared with is priceless."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Nothing spectacular like we had expected. Service was very unprofessional. We were seated downstairs in a very uncomfortable booth where my husband had to face the wall the entire time.  We had high hopes but not worth the drive to Pineville."}
{"text":"We visited during Restaurant Week.  The service was great, and we enjoyed the menu.  The chilled corn bisque was awesome and I was craving a good corn on the cob when I finished it.  We also love the flavor of the pork tomahawk chop with braised kale and pineapple rum salsa.  The kale had incredible flavor and the whole dish was cook perfectly.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was outstanding!  We went on a whim while trying to find a restaurant in Pineville and this restaurant is a true gem.  Great food, awesome cocktails and fabulous desserts.  You can tell that they put their whole heart in the food they serve.  Its a MUST try!"}
{"text":"I don't know how else to word this, THIS SHIT IS NASTY!!!!  First meal I had all day so almost anything would have tasted good.  I ordered the duck, I even asked the people working their if it was any good, they said Yes, very good!!  

First it came in a card board to go box and nothing on the bottom to stop wetness from coming through the card board

Second it had a horrible smell like old garbage, but since I just spent about 34$ on a meal the size of an appetizer I figured I might as well try it.

Third the duck was barely even warm, more like room temperature and it wouldn't chew, it was so chewy had to be spit out and was about impossible to eat.  Tasted like unseasoned pig feet.

Forth It had some sort of peach medly under the duck that was cold like it just came out the refrigerator.  The peaches and what ever else that mess was looked cooked but were very cold with no flavor to them.  

Most disgusting meal I think I've ever tried.

I don't see how this establishment will stay in business or how they managed to have such good reviews. 

Tried 3 bites to much, thank God Outback's open till 10"}
{"text":"Quiet, hole-in-the-wall place near Ballantyne (in the office park near Earthfare). Restaurant is decorated fairly well considering it is in an office area, and there is a full bar.

The food is very creative - I believe the name comes from the fact the chef works in all kinds of cuisines, hence the greek appetizers, southern style pork, french-style roast chicken, etc. It is a little frenetic on the menu, but the kitchen is able to turn out lovely renditions of classic items. In particular the duck with french lentils and fig sauce is sublime. 

Desserts are good, but nothing outstanding. I would go over to Salara and finish the evening there instead (or go across the street to Vintage!)"}
{"text":"Food was just OK and over priced.  Service was excellent and the building was interesting.  Probably not going back for a meal - perhaps for a drink and appetizers."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Due to it's size, it's very cozy. The food is excellent and the service is terrific. It's not in the greatest location so I wonder about their longevity, but for a nice, romantic dinner, this is definitely one of our favorites. The scallops we had were to die for."}
{"text":"I always hate to drop a rating, but I've visited a few times to give them a fair shake, and I'm really not impressed. I'm not sure what restaurants they're trying to compete with, but based on menu prices, I have to think it's the 5-star places... and they're not there. The food is just okay, and the prices are too high for what you get. On our most recent trip, the service was pretty abysmal with no one saying a word to us when we sat down at the bar, even though a bartender was literally right in front of us. They also had a singer with a guitar downstairs... some people may find this romantic, but I find it cheesy; Ifelt like I was on an '80s cruise ship. Also - random complaint - but the chairs are crazy uncomfortable. I've definitely visited Global for the last time."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Global for dinner last night. The mussels, she crab soup and scallops were excellent. We finished with creme brûlée that was out of this world! The ambiance and service exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend Global to everyone."}
{"text":"It's a far cry from the old Global that we knew and loved. One good entree, but the wahoo special was overly salty, the baby eggplant too tough to cut and the mini pumpkin had hard pieces of shell that fell into the soft filling. I told the server when she cleared the plate, but clearly she never told the chef or he would have come by. DISAPPOINTING AT BEST.  Service was absolutely horrible. There were only 6 tables occupied...and servers were non existent. Waited for wine, bread, the check. It was such a let down. We were so excited for the new concept...please go back to what worked."}
{"text":"Bernard & his staff are superb! We hosted a big dinner for out of town guests on a Friday night. They were one of 2 local restaurants able and willing to accommodate us on a Friday @7:30. Bernard is very detail oriented, makes great suggestions and very easy to work with. We highly recommend dinner or events at Global. Our NYC family & friends were very impressed with the food, wine and service!"}
{"text":"Ate here for Restaurant Week. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could because my food was pretty good but my wife's food was just OK. Started out with the Pork Bahn MI and the Mac and Cheese. Pork was good, Mac and Cheese not so much. Moved onto.the short ribs which were good but the Mahi was rather plain. Finished with the chocolate mousse and the nougat glace which were decent. Ambiance was nice and service was decent but not somewhere I'll be putting on my list to return and try."}
{"text":"Global  never disappoints, and it's new location is so stylish! The menu is not large because it is a hands on chef driven kitchen, but it has a very pleasing variety including vegetarian options. The food is presented elegantly, and every.singe.bite is scrumptious. Chef Bernard puts himself into every plate and takes time to come out and speak with the diners.  He has shared techniques and many smiles with us.  We are happy to see the new bar bites menu for more casual snacks.  Chef's wife and partner, Shannon, is a gracious presence as well.  Their pride and love for the restaurant just glows."}
{"text":"Happy birthday to me....nope!!!  Arrived at 8:54 pm last night and was told that the kitchen was closing in five minutes, but we we're welcome to drink at the bar. The place had one table with two people currently dining. I was a server when I was younger, and as big as a pain as it was, we were never allowed to turn down a customer when we were open. Had heard great things about Global and was hoping to find out on my birthday, but it was not meant to be."}
{"text":"2/10/18
Had dinner here last night with friends 
Every one had a great meal except my companion ordered the mahi-mahi and said it was very salty and was dark when in the past when she has ordered it in other restaurants in was a lighter color and not salty didn't think it was Mahi-Mahi
The owner and chef if excellent I can't believe he would substitute a different fish and call it Mahi-Mahi could just have been a bad piece 
This is a very good restaurant and we will go back great

Main Street
Jayson our waiter was Excellent suggested a very good wine that we shared also suggested some dynamite specials that were on the menu especially the tomato salad was out of this world and my companion had Seabass and I had the ribeye absolutely excellent food excellent service I will go back as often as possible"}
{"text":"Global Restaurant is a great combination of classy and casual. Upstairs has a formal ambience whereas the downstairs is more casual. Everything we have tried on their menu is delicious including their bar bites and desserts. If you are looking for a great burger, do not pass up Global Restaurant! It has amazing flavor and should not be overlooked. It is part of their bar bites menu so is only served in their downstairs area as it is after all a more casual choice for dinner. Overall, a restaurant you should definitely check out."}
{"text":"We thought we would try Global after all of the positive reviews. We had tickets to a show and thought this would add to it nicely and make it a great evening out. It is a small restaurant tucked away in an office complex. We had early reservations so that we could get uptown for our show and were the first diners. It felt a bit odd to be in the only ones in a small restaurant, a bit like goldfish in a bowl, but we were well attended by our server and soon there were others diners. 

We started with the cheese platter, which was wonderful. Hard to mess up sliced cheese I suppose. For our main entrees, we ordered a tilefish special and the lamb. I love lamb and theirs is a duo of loin and belly, so I was quite excited to try it. I love pork belly, and am familiar with the cut, and the server explained that the belly was braised for over 24 hours. Yummy, right? I wish I had enjoyed it.. I can only describe my dinner as disappointing. They cover the meat with this gravy like sauce. Since we were the first in the restaurant, I can only assume that the chef was still prepping or had just finished prepping his kitchen for service because my sauce was refrigerator cold. I don't like to send things back, and didn't want my meat reheated past my requested medium rare temperature, so I scraped the sauce off the meat and ate my cooled loin and vegetables. I turned to the belly and realized they had given me the cap. I couldn't find a trace of meat in all of the solid fat. Again, I am familiar with belly. I understand it is a fatty cut, but this was white solid fat. I asked the server if the cut looked unusually fatty and he went to speak to the chef. The chef responded that the belly is basically like a solid piece of bacon, it is supposed to be fatty. If he were to slice me a new piece, it would look the same. Then the server adds.. \"it is edible\". Hmm. No thank you. If it had any meat, or if the fat were somewhat liquified or caramelized, it would have agreed with the \"edible\" comment, but this was disgusting. The chef doesn't even want to see the slices to gauge my complaint? I left the two slices on my plate, disappointed that I was still hungry. I ate a bit of my boyfriend's fish and wished I had ordered something, anything, else. I don't really like dessert, but I was hoping to fill my stomach a bit more. We both got dessert. I got this marscapone strawberry thing, which was really sweet.. but I was hungry. He got the trio of brulees, which he was happy with. 

When we were presented with the bill, the server asked how everything was. I again expressed my disappointment. I had only eaten half my dinner. He again let me know what the chef had said. He returned with the credit card and let me know the manager had taken a dessert off the check. I was disappointed that at no point, after complaining twice about the quality of the cut, did I see the manager, or did the chef see my cut. 

Thanks for the dessert, but way too little effort. A bad situation can e turned around by simply acknowledging a guest's complaint. Rather I felt condescended to regarding my knowledge of the belly cut and unimportant to the senior management to bother stopping to talk to me. 

I really wanted to like this place, but there are other restaurants in Charlotte and we won't be back.

VISITED JUNE 8, 2013"}
{"text":"Ok. Looking for a nice restaurant to have dinner for the family. Mother had a burger, 2 kids split diver scallops, 1 kid ordered she crab and Mac n cheese off of the bar menu, wife had  , and I had the ribeye (2 pieces of meat the size of a meatball). Charged a split fee, charged for every soda refill, everything. No wine, 1 mixed drink. Bill north of 250. Wait staff was great, chef/owner great. Food to price to portion ratio? Definitely other places to go , equally as good if not better, at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here on a Thursday night.  At that time there were only a few other diners, so it was quiet and we received plenty of attention and enjoyable conversation with the waiters.  The food we were served was quite good by any standards but especially by Charlotte's.  We had a cheese plate, cured beef, scallops,  mushroom ravioli, and finished with mouse.  The food was all very flavorful, well presented, fresh, some local, and creative.  The bar menu is also very good with a pretty good selection of wine by the bottle and glass, and there are a few unique beer options if that's your preference.  I had some of both.  The only thing lacking was our dessert course, which was a bit thick and rich for what we expected of a mouse.  

The major downside to this restaurant is the location and the atmosphere.  It's located in an office park, which has a very deserted feeling in the evening. It's also buried pretty deeply as was evidenced by the abundance of signage directing you to the restaurant, and not that easy to find.  Inside the restaurant, it seemed to be trying so desperately to make you think you aren't in a space intended to be an office.  The industrial carpeting and drop ceiling were ever present.  The art, music, and other decorations make you feel like you are in the star trek cafeteria.

The food is great, but this place would be so much better in a more authentic location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Global during Restaurant Week-and oh boy, were we delighted with the food and service!

Ah, how I love Restaurant Week-especially at a restaurant I've never tried before! Up front I was impressed with their offerings for the tailored menu, and we went HUNGRY.

I will tell you-they are all by themselves in the office park, tucked away in the back corner in their own little world. They have been in business for 7 years, so your GPS is probably right instead of wrong as it leads you away from civilization.

I ordered the:
*Ooo La La Shrimp-Shrimp flash fried (no batter!) and tossed in a DELICIOUSly complex papaya vinaigrette and served with micro greens. The four shrimp were quite large, and had a very subtle heat I thought, with very Indian/Asian flavors.
*Mouclade Fourasine Style-mussels, shrimp and clams served with a creamy curry fennel risotto and focaccia. I literally scraped my bowl clean with the bread and would have licked the plate if I thought I wouldn't be judged toooo harshly by diners close to me... SO TASTY! This was Indian meets Italian with this incredible dish.
*Mascarpone Strawberry Verrine-so light and fresh, layers of mascarpone and strawberries topped with coconut crunchy  

My boyfriend ordered the: 
*Spring Mix Salad with pork belly-little pork belly explosions in the lettuces, carmelized pecans, manchego cheese and apple vinaigrette. 
*Sea Bass-wilted greens, braised shallots, Sriracha, & cauliflower goat cheese sauce. The flavor factor was HUGE! The fish was cooked perfectly, so moist and flavorful, with a delicate flavor that married excellently with the cauliflower goat cheese sauce. I think he DID lick his plate. :-) French meets Asian, I wish I was having this for dinner tonight!
*Nougat Glace-served frozen, roasted hazelnuts, pecans & maple crème Anglaise (I almost licked his plate). BEAUTIFUL presentation, with a foot-long puffed pastry that looked almost like a quill stuck in the frozen cream.

They served complimentary bread with a fennel butter-which amazingly paired well with everything we ate, including the wine. They had a special Restaurant Week Wine Menu, with three $30/bottle wines to choose from .We had the Malbec, which went well with everything we ate.

The chef, Bernard, came out to meet us after we were finished. His wife greeted us when we came in initially. They were SO FRIENDLY and hospitable, we will definitely go back and enjoy some more of their menu selections! Highly recommended-this restaurant truly has \"global\" flair, beautiful presentation, cozy atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but way overpriced. Service was ok, but would have expected more. Unless we caught a groupon or received a large GC, we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Bernard is the most passionate chef I've ever known. The menu...using local sources...seasonally has never disappointed. Definitely my favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday to eat with my wife.  It was restaurant week but I didn't come to try out their food.  They didn't have a regular menu so it was only restaurant week menu. 

Everything we order was out.  The restaurant didn't seem really busy at all.  My wife had the ribeye steak and it was okay.  You can't really mess that up.  I had the lamb pave which was really disappointing.  The meat was very chewy and the cut of the meat was more of like prime ribs but tasted like lamb.  The rice or grains that came with it was hard and the sauce was bland.  The dessert was okay but once again what we wanted was out.  The chocolate dessert I felt like it was old and tasted like it came from sams club.  

I thought a 4 star restaurant would be better than this but really was disappointed.  Maybe we went on the wrong day because yelp has always been right.  When I go to a 4 star restaurant I would expect the food to be more tasteful.  Our bill was about $120 which included a bottle of wine.  Even the wine we ordered, it was 2012 on the menu but they brought a 2013.  

The only good experience I had was at the end of dinner the chef came out and greet us.  He's from France and my wife spoke French being from Montreal, they had a quick conversation.  I love good service but I wish the food was better.  The service was ok.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends and would not come back myself but if you want to try it yourself I would recommend not getting the lamb."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, very creative menu. Everything exceed expectations. Thank Chef Bernard!"}
{"text":"The upstairs dining area is relaxing and elegant.  We dined during Charlotte's restaurant week and the food along with the presentation and service were excellent.  The cocktails were perfectly prepared and Global was offering selected bottles of wine at a reduced price to go along with the restaurant week menu.  There is also a parking lot on the side with free parking and easy access to the restaurant.  A thoroughly wonderful experience that our party of four enjoyed.  We have followed Global since its inception in Toringdon nothing was sacrificed in moving Pineville.  Kudos to Shannon and Bernard."}
{"text":"This place was great. The beer/cocktail selection was nice, but my food was exceptional. The short ribs were cooked perfectly and everything on the plate made for one awesome, complete dish. The chef/owner came out to say a quick hello and his wife helped the bartenders and chatted with me for a little while. They seemed like nice folks and they can damn sure run a nice restaurant, so if you're on the fence about trying Global, get off the fence and go try it out."}
{"text":"Okay this was my second trip to Global --the first being 3 years ago and the last tonight. We were greeted by a uppity hostess ..who acted like we could not be seated or taken care of..I understand --we DID NOT have a reservation, but it was a Tuesday Night and it was 6 PM and No one was there....no one other than myself and the waiters. She did say she would try and I went to the restroom and came back out and she ..said..POSSIBLY we could sit at the bar...So we took it..a party of three...and we were happy to be there--it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where YOU are going to spend YOUR MONEY and they act indifferent to you..
We started out with a bottle of BOOM BOOM Sirah..it was good. We ordered 3 appetizers...the Mediterranean Lamb, the Berkshire Pork Belly, and Butternut Squash  Soup.   Soup was good..Pork Belly can do no wrong..EVER and the Lamb...not quite good and way to tough and well done.
We then ordered the Sea Bass and the Open Raviolio. The Open Raviolio had way to much canned tomatoes, zucchini and wet veggies...not really there. The Sea Bass looked beautiful..the top 1/2 inch was edible the rest..was a tough gelatinous piece of sea carcass. NOT able to cut or eat. They did take it off the menu..
The waiter ( Chris) was very good ...he was the bright light of the restaurant...
The restaurant..was ALMOST GOOD..Not quite..not worth another trip back..Oh yea and it was very high priced for a Not Great place...."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, the decor, the food, the staff and Bernard, the owner/chef. This will be my new 'go to' restaurant."}
{"text":"Global is a real find hidden among office buildings on the fringe of Ballantyne. I enjoyed dinner last night and hope to return soon. I ordered from their (held over) Queen's Feast menu and was very pleased with their braised Berkshire pork shoulder spring roll with an Asian cabbage, peanut slaw and sweet ginger soy sauce . Service was kind and attentive, food was unique, well seasoned and the portions were just right. Global is perfect for an intimate dinner, business meeting, or if you are on your own, a comfortable, relaxing environment."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place located in a quaint spot in Toringdon Way. The food and service were both excellent. The decor was terrific and the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic date night. The location is the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. It's in the back of a corporate park off of a path and it's just a little strange. Other than that it's a very nice place to eat"}
{"text":"i recently went to global for a family dinner looking for something fun and different to try, and i was blown away by how amazing it was. we went for queen's feast, so you choose a starter, entree, and dessert all for $35 per person. i ordered the pork belly banh mi to start, and i was practically licking the plate. they were so good and every ingredient tasted so fresh. i got the pork cheeks for my entree and they were just as good. the meat was so tender like i had never experienced before and the apple butter that went with it paired perfectly. i got the miroir au chocolat for dessert and it was light and fluffy and was just enough to satisfy my chocolate craving. the raspberry sauce that came with it went so well with it also. overall, i would absolutely return and recommend this place to anyone. with such a personable, kind head chef bernard and such exquisite combinations of almost all locally farmed ingredients, this restaurant is a can't-miss!"}
{"text":"Sweetie and I went to Global this past Thursday night for a nice dinner with friends.  Reservations for 5 were accommodated and off we go.  Nice location in downtown Pineville since it was on the main street it was easy to find and plenty of close parking.
We stepped in and the place was pretty full.  Nice bar and seating area, but they also had a setup upstairs where we went.  I felt bad for the waitresses walking up and down but once I tasted the delicious offerings my lack of empathy kicked in.  On to the food!
Sweetie and I split a She Crab Soup and once it came we were immediately sorry we didn't get our own bowls.  It was delightful and rivaled any She Crab that I've had in the \"big\" seafood areas like Charleston.  It was creamy, well seasoned, and quite honestly soul saving.  You can tell the person that made it knew what they were doing.
I ordered the Diver Scallops and Sweetie had the Sea Bass.  Scallops were big and Gordon Ramsey would have been proud at the preparation.  Bouncy, yet firm and covered with a pickled something or other and a house made sriracha rounded it out.  OMG, the sriracha was perfect and added a nice kick to the dish.  Sweetie is a virtual Sea Bass Connoisseur and said it was the best she's ever had.....a statement not to be taken lightly!  We shared a chocolate torte for dessert and called it a night.
Global is priced well, had many good menu offerings and we will definitely be back.  Well done!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is quant, my husband and I each tried something different. My husband and I can't remember what he had however we remember it was delicious. What we continue to discuss is the lamb dish I chose. The flavor was lovely, but the lamb probably had two tablespoon of actual meat. The entire piece was nothing but fat and grizzle. We said something to the waiter and he basicly lifted his shoulders made a face and said he was sorry. We alluded to it again hoping he would offer another piece but he ignored us? For a special meal way over $25.00 save your money! Order something else or go someplace else! I went to culinary school and owned a catering business. We chose Global because we are \"foodies\" respect and enjoy a fine meal. Boy, it was such a dissapointment. It's hard to desire another try when the only thing you can remember was the negative part!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best dining experiences I have had in Charlotte. Bernard, the head chef and owner, makes sure your dining experience is always truly exceptional.

Global is currently located off the beaten path, but definitely a hidden a gem. The atmosphere, environment and experience make for a perfect evening. Always very accommodating, I have hosted two corporate dinners at Global and everyone in attendance has praised the service, food and experience."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with both the food and the service.  When I come to Charlotte I usually have my daughter choose where we will dine.  She was in the food industry for many years and always finds interesting new places for us to try.  Chef Bernard didn't disappoint.  Our waiter was attentive and considerate.  The food was perfection on a plate.  We chose the lamb, duck and corvina and then shared the dishes.  Each one was presented in an artful way and combined surprising flavors which pleased all of us.  Don't miss this little gem."}
{"text":"Global is an unexpected treasure in the heart of Pineville.  The food, service, and atmosphere were all top notch. I had chilled corn soup, sea bass and chocolate panna cotta. My husband had the a heirloom tomato salad and the sea bass. Each dish was perfection. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was there last night as a part of restaurant week. Everything was great.  The cranberry Margarita was so good.  Our waitress Jessica was the best. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. And the food was delicious.  We cleared our plates on every course ! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you really want to like but it gets harder and harder to every visit. It's always empty when we walk in besides on the weekends when they have live music. We ordered water, one app, and split a meal. $60. Did I mention they charge you $5 to split a meal? I've never had that happen, and feel we overpaid for the experience and service. Waitress was hard to communicate with as she was extremely socially awkward. Felt like pulling teeth just to place the order. The menu is very limited. Won't be back sadly, gave it too many chances. (Decor and ambiance was nice, so added an extra star)"}
{"text":"I went here last Thursday with a business partner and was blown away.  The place was awkwardly empty, but the craft drinks, wine selection, and level of food was unexpectedly awesome.  Chef came out after the meal and asked how everything was, and after exchanging pleasantries he said \"now you're family.\" Going back very soon for another \"family\" meal."}
{"text":"Ah yes. My sweetie and I drove around Tennessee and the Carolinas this year for our vacation and just loved it.  I am just now pasting all our mementos into our vacation scrap book and I ran across the receipt from our dinner at the Global.  It was a wonderful dinner so expertly and creatively prepared and was one of the many highlights of our trip. Chef Bernard Brunet came out and talked with us about our meal, and I really liked that.  We are a couple of foodies from the west coast and were so happy to find this place.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Fine dining has FINALLY reached the Pineville area! Pineville will no longer be compressed with chain restaurants if the community continues to open restaurants such as the Global Restaurant. 

I ordered the She Crab Soup, Beef Tartare and Mac n Cheese. PHENOMENAL FLAVORS! 

The soup was a beautiful blend of crab, sherry and cream. It's silky with chunks of sweet crab in every bite.
The tartare was definitely my favorite, as it had a slight smokiness that married well with the vinaigrette and pickled veggies served with it.

The mac n cheese was creamy with hints of several cheeses blended together. Although bacon and I have a troubled history, I felt the risk was worth it as it wasn't overcooked nor did it overpower the dish.

I am urging everyone to venture into downtown Pineville and travel the Global's menu (no passport needed). From the elegant wallpaper upon entering to the superb service rendered, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service,  great food, and great atmosphere.  The rating on the food on a scale of one to ten is eleven."}
{"text":"Global moved to Pineville last year an its just 5 minutes from my house I had not been but my neighbors said the food was n great service. Today I had the chance to go they arent open on sundays but my neighbors daughter got married an had her reception at Global. Its very nice inside an we just had appetizers but they were amazing . They served meatballs with a dipping sauce it sorta had a cheese flavor I could have ate a whole plate lol They served pulled pork sorta like a nacho very good drizzled with bbq sauce yum. They also served hummus on a tortilla chip. Im gonna make it a point to have dinner at Global an I recommend
 if  your looking for a reception location or any type of special event choose Global. The owners were great in helping with the cake cutting"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was great.  I will definitely be going back!  I highly recommend the pork belly appetizer and the lamb entree."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a nice family dinner or romantic date night. The downstairs area has a sleeker more contemporary feel while the upstairs is more formal and cozy with white linen tablecloths. During nice weather, there is also an outdoor patio that is dog friendly. In addition to great food, the restaurant has a good bar program with seasonal cocktails and a nice selection of wines."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of great things about Global but I don't make it out to Ballantyne that often.  If you are in the area, it is definitely worth checking out.  Now we just know what to order next time:

Appetizers: The portions are perfectly sized (not as small as Good Food, but not like something from Maggiano's either). 

Quail: I really like quail and the menu indicated that this was their \"signature dish\" so I figured it would be outstanding. This was the only app we didn't finish. It was not very good at all (again, coming from someone who generally loves quail)

Berkshire Pork Belly: Described by our waiter as a \"big piece of bacon\" it was pretty flavorful, but definitely on the fatty side.  I know that is the definition of pork belly but I can see how it would be off-putting to some. I really enjoyed the bed of lentils it came on. We finished it but wouldn't order it again.

Eggplant and Greek Olive Spring roll: THIS is what I am talking about.  This was by far our favorite dish of the night. It comes with a goat cheese and honey sauce that is good enough to drink. I'm going to try to replicate it for sure. 

We also shared the sea bass entrée which was very good. They put the Sriracha on the side since my husband doesn't really care much for spicy. 

Split the nougat glace dessert which was incredible. It reminded me of a dessert I had in St. Barth's on our honeymoon. Not too heavy or sweet, but just enough to hit the spot! 

The restaurant was slammed, so the service was a little slow, but still very friendly. A quaint, cozy and delicious restaurant that was not at all stuffy.  Definitely a nice change of atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came here after a few pints next door at Trackside Craft beer. We had 4 different entrees and everyone raved. Great ambiance. Warm decor. Soft music. The chef is French and takes a great deal of pride in his cooking. The portions are European sized so that at the end of the meal you know it tasted great but aren't too stuffed to still enjoy sitting over another drink. Reasonably priced wine. An ok craft beer selection. Great Irish Coffee after dinner. We will be back with a larger group  of friends. Pineville Main Street is an undiscovered  part of south Charlotte. 

They have a more formal upstairs dining area that we didn't try tonight. But we will."}
{"text":"Tried Global for the first time yesterday. I was very pleased with the atmosphere, and everyone on staff was spot on. Had the salmon on wontons for an appetizer, and it was delish. The She Crab soup was fantastic. Had the entree with scallops, potatoes and spaghetti squash. The combination of the flavors with the sriracha sauce on the side was a home run. I prefer my scallops more on the well done side, but they were great. The wine selection was more than adequate, with a nice selection across price ranges. We chose the Sea Pearl Sauvignon Blanc, and it went well with our selections. After reading, you may be wondering why I am giving Global three stars. Simple: I don't agree with a separate charge for two people splitting an entree. My girlfriend and I are conscious about what and how much we eat. We split entrees routinely, for this very reason. It was disheartening to see a $5 split entree charge added to a bill that was over $100. Seems a little \"chincy\" to me, and not appreciated. We did enjoy an after meal cocktail at the bar before leaving. Overall a good experience, and I may go back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the \"tapas-style\" offerings. People are bored with full size dinners and want just a few tasty items to eat while sipping wine or other beverages. Price points are good for this elevated level of restaurant. The ginger soup, salad and brussel sprouts were delicious. We will try the hamburger next time with frites."}
{"text":"I must say this was a real surprise.  Not only was the experience a memorable one for our mid-week anniversary, but it was possibly the best restaurant experience I have had in Charlotte.  We took some special out of town guests downtown a few years ago to a well-recognized old traditional Charlotte restaurant, and spent (with tip) over twice the amount spent tonight per person (without discount) for a nice dinner, wine, dessert, etc. in a dining room that was way too dark to see our entrees.  It was fine, but based on comparisons to other US large city dining experiences we have had, not really that special.  Next time we want to show off Charlotte to our out of town guests, we will definitely come to Bernard.  We had a wonderful appetizer tower with 3 exceptional choices, with our favorite being a tossup between the steak tartare and the spring roll.  We ordered the duck and the beef tenderloin as our entrees, and although the beef was very good, the duck was truly superb.  We shared the nougat dessert and had brandy and coffee to finish out our evening.  I have no criticism to offer, just a hearty recommendation.  I cannot imagine that you would be disappointed.  Bernard lets his food be the star of his show - he does not need anything else to make your evening truly exceptional."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Charlotte! I have been to the restaurant for business meetings twice now. Parties of 12 to 15 people. Chef Bernard has been more than accommodating and has provided exceptional menu choices and attentive waitstaff.he has also been available to present the food himself and shows great pride in his efforts. I highly recommend this restaurant, they deserve more attention and are worth the effort to find them."}
{"text":"Located in a quaint, little strip in Pineville, this restaurant offers upscaled menu and a warm, inviting dining experience.  Bottom level of this restaurant is catered toward a more casual crowd, and the top level serves a more formal crowd (but not much in terms of upscaled ambiance).  Initially, I was disappointed with the sparse menu selection...as there are literally less than half a dozen items on the main menu.  Since not too thrilled with the skimpy main selection (with surprisingly snobby pricing), I ordered their specialty soup and two appetizers (and dessert) in its place.  The appetizers, Beef Tartare and Mac 'n Cheese, were good...but not great.  However, I was very impressed with the She Crab soup and the Creme Brûlée, which came in a cute, TRI-medley presentation.  I came with a group, and some of the entrees that others ordered looked quite delicious, so I might have written off their entrees too soon.  Also, the service was very friendly and down-to-earth...just what you'd expect in a restaurant situated in this quaint, little area of town.  For these reasons, I would definitely consider returning at a future date.  However, if I'm craving a truly upscaled dining experience in this price category ($30 and up), I would probably opt for several other restaurant choices in its place."}
{"text":"Global is my favorite restaurant in the South Charlotte area! Tonight was amazing. The Sea Bass was incredible...as was everything else, including the wine selection. Chef Bernard is a master. So glad  to have this gem so close to home!"}
{"text":"I have found a new favorite Charlotte restaurant....in a very unlikely spot. Everyone in our group loved their entrees including the special Mahi which came with an creamy artichoke and chorizo sauce. She crab soup was also excellent and the apple berry tart was my favorite dessert.  The entire menu is done with an excellent flair. 

The wine list is especially interesting with some unusual choices and good value.  

Our server was was attentive but allowed us a very comfortable, relaxed pace."}
{"text":"Average. Fresh but lacks flavor in a major way. Ribeye was 32$ and it wasn't worth it. Won't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"The new location is super convenient and easy to find.  Downtown Pineville and Global are hidden gems in Charlotte.  

The food is every bit as good as it was at the old location but the atmosphere is much better.  They did a great job renovating the building.  

The chef came out to speak with us and make sure we were enjoying our meals.  The wine selection is fantastic and they have a handful good of beers on tap.  

I'll go back"}
{"text":"I I had the pleasure of dining here for Restaurant Week with a few friends. The ambience is perfect for  Girls Night Dinner or a Romantic evening. I arrived early and was pleasantly greeted by Jamie, the bartender. She was very attentive and friendly.  I asked her to make my own \"special\" drink and she did so with a smile. Shannon, the owner-I hope I got her name right, was very approachable and friendly as well. She even mentioned my drink Jackson Sunshine may be on the menu this summer! 

My friends & I were promptly seated upstairs where Jessica was our server. She was very pleasant and answered all of our questions with a smile. The food was amazing! Everything was cooked  well and beautifully presented! I've heard of some upscale restaurants have attitudes with Restaurant Week diners. This is something I've  never understood because they could be your next regular customer. I am happy to say I will definitely be returning to Global not only because of the delicious food but because of the excellent service!"}
{"text":"Saw the construction go up near my office. Never went to the old local and thats a shame. Atmosphere and service were great. Glad Pineville has a spot like this. Food was delicious. I had the pork cheeks and she crab soup. Plenty of food and the dish had a nice subtle smoke flavlr that I enjoyed. Wish they were open for lunch. Definitely a good place to try out. Amy wife had the duck and it was very good also and cooked perfectly. Verh nice savory yet sweet taste that she loved. Definitely a spot for people thag enjoy creative dishes. We will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Global was fantastic! I've been to the former location, so, my expectations were high. We were not disappointed!

My husband and I went during restaurant week and totally enjoyed our evening. We both tried the pork belly starter, which was tender and delicious. The filet entree was expertly cooked, with a divine reduction sauce and ginger carrot mash. I never eat my entire meal, but this time, the portions were perfect. I usually choose the restaurant I go to based off of the dessert choices, and the strawberry and rhubarb sorbet was AMAZING!

We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I sooooooo wanted to give this restaurant 5 stars but I just couldn't because of location.  Which I will touch on at the end.  First, the food!

She Crab Soup:  10/10  The chef is a Charleston native and apparently prides himself on this dish.  Well... bravo, my friend.  I will be back many-a-times for this alone.  

Fresh Bread/Cheese:  6/10  You might think this is weird to add this in the review but I thought it was pretty cool that they made fresh butter/cheese every night with their own twist.  It just so happen that cream cheese and dill was below average to my pallet.

Pork Tenderloin:  9/10  Succulent! Delicious tender pieces of pork laid over a risotto to die for... Worth a 2nd, 3rd, possibly 4th order in a row.  

Additionally, they have a wide selection of local micro brews which always pushes you up on my list.  Great job, guys.  Only problem.... Located back in the middle of a corporate park well off the beaten path.  Just odd.  But a good find if you venture there.  

Enjoy!!

{"text":"I am giving Global 5 Stars- yet the Restaurant Week performance was a tough 3.5-4.  With that I will be back- often. The smaller closeness in size and ambience sets a quaint comfortable mood with its is low lights, makes you want to stay all night long! Unfortunately they just weren't staffed adequately or prepared for the bombardment of Restaurant Week. The Food was amazing, truly inventive & tasteful (fine dining at its best!), Bernard the owner was so gracious and appreciative, and bless our waiter, he was well-professionally-trained and tended to us as best he could, but the rest of the establishment was working against him. 

Read below for Restaurant Week experience:

Upon arrival (7:45) our table was not ready (rsvp'd for 8, which is fine, we were early) so we went to the bar for a drink while we waited. While we saw plenty of people working and fluttering behind the bar, apparently only one lady was a bar tender(?), a wine, another wine, a beer and the 4th in our group ordered a Dark & Stormy...she snapped with a horrible attitude \"we can't make that\" and took off to go get the drinks she could get - didn't ask him if he wanted anything else, or offer what she could make him- her attitude was that of Frazzled and frustrated and unhappy to have a job and be working. She was like this to everyone, shitty & snappy to co-workers (we felt bad for them!) and to guests. She should not be at this kind of establishment, she belongs at an Applebee's.

She got the rest of us or drinks and our table was ready upstairs. 3 of us with drinks, 1 nothing. We sat for 10-15 min (the drinkless member pretty pissed) and our over worked waiter arrived. He was calm, patient and could feel our discomfort. He took new drink orders and gave us menu highlights and did his best.  He was over-seated, too many tables with no support for drink, bread or water runners, and a slow bar with a pissy bar tender and slow kitchen were not his fault - and he handled like a freaking champ! I applaud his attitude and ability, it isn't easy to walk into a storm!

With the bar down stairs, drinks were slow to arrive, and they ran out of the beer the guys were drinking - so they had to switch -- but when the food did come, it was so amazing, the food was so flavorful and unique, it went miles to help us forget our judgments of the flaws in the evening.

I am 100% confident the inconsistencies we experienced were due to Restaurant Week, and that any other normal night, Global kills it.  I plan to come back, at a slower paced night (hopefully the bar tender has her attitude adjusted- especially for this caliber of a restaurant) for a much more fun evening!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequented Global back when they first opened in Toringdon.  We loved it then and love the new location even more.  We recently stopped in for drinks and appetizers, and it was fantastic.  The brussel sprouts we're phenomenal, as was the burger we ordered.  Service at the bar was prompt and courteous.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The Global is worth finding. In an area of chain restaurants, it is unique. I recently had to find an unscale restaurant near Ballantyne to host a business dinner for 12.  Some colleagues and I did an initial \"site visit\" or \"test run\" as a group of four.  We all agreed it was definitely the place to return for the larger business dinner!  One of my colleagues, who is a real \"foodie\", proclaimed that it was the best meal he had eaten in Charlotte!  Others, who live in Charlotte, said they did not know about The Global, but would be coming back now that they knew.  Bernard, the owner/chef, worked with me on the larger dinner party to determine a pre-set menu with my choice of wine.  The wine menu, btw, is top of the line!  Not the run of the mill, same old stuff.  Excellent explanations of a variety of bottles you don't see everywhere else. Bernard obviously works with wholesalers who carry something different.  The food and service at The Global are top notch.  Bernard is charming.  See the other reviews for more on the food. The location is truly a bit different, in an office park. It is in a nice area, so don't let that deter you.  If you are tired of chain restaurants, and desire a nice ambience, with interesting, well thought out, excellent food and wine - make reservations for a table at The Global.  Everyone that has been there with me, now has it on their list. You get what you pay for, and the value for what you pay here is well worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty decor, great food presentation, food is average, price is REDICULOUSE for that kind of quality. I like it that this resteraunt tries to be your above average eatery, however, the taste of the food is just plain...nothing memorable. The actual location is very hidden as well. The staff there is friendly however this doesn't make up for the average food fare."}
{"text":"My dinner group visited Global for our Anniversary Dinner. Having never been I was very impressed with the decor, modern setting with an upstairs, with a more formal dining room. Downstairs has a bar with a more casual setting and different menu then upstairs.

We dined upstairs, one of only two tables that night.
After reviewing the menu I was a little disappointed with the limited options and how high the prices were. Several of us started with appetizers, from the She Crab Soup to Octopus. I had the She Crab Soup, smelled a little fishy at first but was good. Not the best I've ever had. Bread was served which was a little stale.
For my entree, I actually chose two appetizers (as I was not th with the entree options). I had the Beef Tartare and Prosciutto Macaroni & Cheese.
Both good, but nothing great. The Macaroni & Cheese was somewhat dry and seemed day old. Others had the Lamb, Duck and Scallops. Everyone seemed to enjoy their Entrees.

Overall, the service and food was good, but I had higher hopes."}
{"text":"Food was little above ok . Prices do not match the taste or portion . The decor and vibe is great . Bar area is great as well .  We ate upstairs and we were the only ones up there . Was little to quiet.  Great service all around , just need to get those prices down ."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant!!!  Loved the atmosphere/ambience.  We came a little early, thinking we would need to have a drink at the bar before they could seat us but we were promptly seated in the upstairs more upscale dining area.  Even though it was restaurant week  the menu items were all very different and provided plenty of wonderful choices.  Our waiter was \"superb\", the food was excellent and the entire dining experience was one to remember.  I will return!!"}
{"text":"Global is like two restaurants in one.  Downstairs is casual and open and upstairs is more classy and elegant.  On the night our trip through the Charlotte area, there was a wine tasting event downstairs so we were given a lovely table upstairs near a window.  

We began the evening with some local craft beer and the Beef Tartare from the starter menu.  The beef was properly chilled and the extras were good.  Our only complaint is the description says it comes with local pickled vegatables but we only recieved two small pieces of cauliflower :(

Moving on, we enjoyed a delicious bottle of red wine with Carolina Shrimp small plate.  Everything on the plate was tasty, though a bit too room temp...

Next, Schweety had the Baby Lettuce Salad with had a nice mix to it and I had the Mussels, which I will say was some of the best that I've ever had.  

Service was friendly and knowledgeable with the the right amount of attentiveness!"}
