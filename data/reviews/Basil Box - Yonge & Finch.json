{"text":"Yasss! So ecstatic finding out this location opened by my work. I finally got to check it out last week, and they had a promotion for buy one box, get the second free! Guess who had lunch taken care of for two days?! The lineup wasn't too long, however it did take a bit of time due to the promotion. There is so much natural sunlight coming in this place, and plenty of places to sit on your lunch break. They were sold out of brown rice, and decided to try the rice noodles. They do give a hefty portion for the base, and I don't want my sauce getting eaten up by it, so I ask for small amounts. I always get the peppers and sweet potatoes, plus lemongrass chicken. I mix the penang and peanut curry sauce, topped with Thai chillies, crispy shallots, herbs, and peanuts. I wish my app was working, as I had a promotion for a free drink. Regardless, the taste was as perfect as it is at their other locations, with great heat to punch. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients, and it is very filling! It does come with a price tag of almost 12 bucks a box, so unfortunately I can't have it all the time. I'm not sure if I can make modifications on the app with less noodles, or a mix of sauce, but do order ahead to avoid the line and get reward points. Check it out...I may walk over tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. So fresh and tasty. Great for meat lovers and vegans alike.  They also have original flavoured carbonated drinks."}
{"text":"Perfect for healthier meals! Basil Box is super clean and the food is also really clean and delicious! I ordered a brown rice base with tofu, tangy tamarind sauce, edamame beans, sweet potato and deep fried shallots for a healthier dinner on the go."}
{"text":"Cute place for healthy-ish Semi-Thai food. Got tons of seating and great decor. Definitely more like a salad place than the usual oily and heavy-handed fast food Thai places. Ask their cashier for suggestions if you're confused, she's got a great smile.  Try their Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"Wow it was so quick! If you don't plan on dining at Basil Box and considering take out, I highly suggest you download the app and order and pay for your box online. It was so easy and the meal was ready in less than 10 mins. I wasn't even out the door yet!   You select a base, veggies, protein, sauce and toppers. Next time though, I will pick a different sauce as the Penang curry was too spicy for me (and I can take spice). It overpowered everything else in my bowl. Everything was fresh though. Staff were nice.  Brilliant location! They probably get a lot of business during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Just checked out the latest Basil box location. Well done on design of the store. You pick your choice of base, meat and sauce that's it. Quality of food is good. I was offered $1 off for drinks but didn't try any drinks. Staff seems very friendly and willing to explain how to order. There are street parking on Yonge, Basil box have their own parking at the back as well. Overall I give 4 out of 5 star. If you are in the area and looking for something fresh and healthy try Basil Box. Price is bit high though, almost $12 for a bowl."}
