{"text":"So I've been here a couple of times and was underwhelmed on each occasion.  The first time my sister and I ordered their strawberry crepe which ended up being a crispy crepe scarcely filled with strawberry jam. Really. 

The following time I came I was seated by the window which had a poster of their green tea red bean slush. So when I ordered it, I actually pointed to the poster. Can't go wrong, right? After waiting a good 15 minutes (this place wasn't packed with people) for my drink I got a green bean slush.  *sigh* The waitress was apologetic and I couldn't be bothered to send it back.  The drink itself was fine (in general, they're comparable to other bubble tea places), just not what I ordered. 

I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. 
A few outlets available for studying with a laptop.
Food is good for a quick meal, but it's not quality. 
Drinks are decent. 
Can get loud on weekends when it gets busy but on weekdays it's quite."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, especially their milk tea with the choice of pearls, small pearls, sago and pudding! Price is reasonable!"}
{"text":"Another bubble tea place in Markham area. I like to categorize tea shops to two category:
1. decent drinks and comfort - quiet environment to get work done (with high speed free wi-fi)
2. good drinks, with lots of specialty drinks - a place to chill with friends

I would say Serissa Cafe is category no.1.  Lots of people come here to get work done (mostly students) so generally it won't get too noisy. The drinks are decent, they won't have lots of unique/ house drinks, but that's okay. 

I've been here a couple times, and their wifi always work, never disappoint us. They also have good customer service, very patient with all our demanding request (such as asking them to turn the music down). It is located in a corner unit, facing highway 7, so there are lots of natural light during the day. It's actually relaxing to work here. They have only about 40 seats ... most of the time they are not too packed, but maybe just call them ahead of time if you don't want to be driving around and looking for a place to work. They also have extension cord, so I'd say there are about 6-8 outlets spread between 3 tables. Parking lot outside does get really busy, because there are a lot of retailers in the same plaza, but they have an underground parking that's open for customers free of charge. I actually like to park at the underground parking during winter times!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little spot to hang out with friends, though I wouldn't bring a large group here because seating is limited and it gets busy on weekends. The decor is contemporary, somewhat eclectic and easy on the eyes. The bookshelf is full of magazines and manga. Their milk tea tasted better than most of the tea houses I've been to lately and I particularly liked the mixture of small and large tapioca balls. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Another Chinese Cafe in Markham. I personally find that their offerings exemplify the issue with most Chinese cafes that are in the area as they push their powdered drinks yet fail to appreciate the beauty of a good hot drink. That being said I find that the few hot drinks that they do offer are fairly decent.

Tried the rose oolong tea without the sweetener, noticed that it still had a palatable sweetness to it hopefully from the rose infusion, though I have a feeling its probably a sweetener of some sort. 

The atmosphere i better than most cafes I've been to though I found it strange that their wifi was locked without a clear way to access it for the customers. Probably relying on people to ask for the wifi password (just noticed jen's review...should have asked)?

The service is average with some errors in the order. The hot tea that I got was warm at best and I promptly asked for it to be remade, not sure if they actually remade it but it was actually hot the second time around (fingers crossed that they didn't just add hot water and diluted the tea)

I might go their again, but it is quite a bit out of the way and very expensive for the type of drinks I prefer. Definitely a place to meet up with friends in the area though."}
{"text":"Did not try their food options, only their bubble tea. I was actually quite impressed with their bubble tea because of their tapioca and value for the drink. The tapioca is smaller and a bit softer than what you typically get at average establishments, so for me I liked this better as it was easy to chew and didn't give that awful stick-to-your-teeth feeling.

The tea itself was okay and their \"regular\" came in a fairly large size (I would say just short of a beer mug) for a drink that cost between $4-5. I think that's not bad in terms of value for bubble tea these days. 

I needed a place close by to sit down with a friend for bubble tea in this area. Sure there may be more \"tasty\" and popular bubble tea establishments like Green Grotto down the street, but if you don't want to spend $5+ on a small drink or don't want to experience a long wait, this is not a bad place to get your bubble tea fix."}
{"text":"I put one star because I have to put down something. The best part of my experience was looking at the place from outside. I got a hot herbal tea- it was okay. I got Taiwanese popcorn chicken, order was forgotten and when I got it, it was soggy and greasy. Some of the ceiling lights weren't working. The female bathroom was out of service. Graffiti was on the door to the male bathroom. So why would I, self confess picky eater, be there. Cause that's is the only place not packed on a Friday night, where I can chat for as long as I want with my friend (without yelling), and use free WiFi. My warning: expect nothing!"}
{"text":"Their milk tea is pretty good. The price is on the higher side and it can take pretty long. The food isn't that great either and would say nothing is really worth the money you pay. I wouldn't really recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"I usually come here every week or so. The warden/hwy7 location is really convenient, but sometimes it's really hard to find parking near the store (due to high traffic from the other Asian eateries in the plaza). 

The bubble tea taste good, and they have tapioca, jelly, pudding as options for their teas. The tapiocas they put are often different size, which gives an unique sensation when you bite on them.

The prices are around $5/drink and wifi is great. 

I'm not giving it a 5 is b/c their food is actually terrible, tiny portions & expensive ( plus I can make it in the microwave too). But seeing they are a bubble tea cafe and their bbt is good, 4 it is!"}
{"text":"Location: Highway 7 E (is it farther than FMP)
Price:$$
Service: Alright

Even though there are plenty of bubble tea places around highway 7 area this is one of my favourite even though it is a bit far for me. No brainer for me that the quality wins ever time. They have unique flavours of bubble tea and they taste great. Hands down their green tea red bean bubble tea is orgasmic- I usually add tapioca to it but grass jelly (correct me if I'm wrong) taste great with it as well. The price for their drinks are good because the quantity of the drink is on par. Another great thing about this place is that their tapioca has two different sizes small and large mixed together.

As for their food... it's alright for the price. I wouldn't recommend to go to Serissa for food but if you're just hungry and want anything-it is passable. 

The environment is cozy, since you'll always see people on their pc/mac and at times ppl studying. As for their washroom, I had a gross experience so I usually avoid going (but I usually try to avoid going to public washrooms overall). Also, their service is a little slow.

A must try for BBT =]"}
{"text":"Came in here tonight with my boyfriend and our friends for their matcha ice cream. I got the matcha green tea and our friends got the swirl. It contained black sesame and matcha mixed together. Very dense ice cream and it's a bang for your buck..well 5bucks. There was so much ice cream in our cones that we struggled to finish it all.

Would definitely come back here for matcha green tea as the flavour was delicious and tasted so good! And would like to try the swirl as the black sesame also tasted very good!"}
{"text":"Serissa is the go-to bubble tea place for my group of friends. It's never extremely busy, it's relatively comfortable, the items are not very expensive. Sometimes, you're hungry and you don't want to spend $7 on a bowl of beef rice or a slice of cake. Serissa has got you covered. Instant noodles for $3! Add an egg for a dollar and you have dinner. 

The drinks are alright. They don't have as much variety as Green Grotto or Ten Ren and the quality is not as great as Cha Time, but it does the job and it stays consistent. I just order the basic honey green tea. My friend always tries to order the more unique items and half the time, they're out (e.g. rose slush). The front page of the menu are their \"signature\" drinks. I don't know if it's still applicable but a couple months ago, they had free size upgrades for those particular drinks. 

Serissa probably won't ignite a passion for bubble tea within you, but it's a cozy place to study or play board games. The service is quick, professional and they're always very courteous. I'll keep coming back.

(4/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Serissa Cate began in Pacific Mall until their expansion to this Office Building Lobby location as their 2nd location that allows for sit down and services.  It's not in the same realm as Destiny nor Go for Tea in scale and definitely not in a visible spot to be seen unless you travel these parts of Highway 7 and Warden avenue.

I give them that their business name is definitely ORIGINAL within GTA.  I also noticed that they focus on Specialty Drinks as in unusual mixes rather than the typical Bubble Green Tea and such that most are know of.  Such items as Black Diamond Green Tea Red Bean Slush, Black Diamond Wintermelon Slush, Caramel Pudding, and The OZ.

Back to this destination...  It has some seating that are comfy and stylish but I still don't understand the reasoning behind 1/8 backrest seats that no one really rests on.  Once again a room full of Laptops on Wi-Fi as they chill while I took a handful of Asian Computer, Photography, Technology Magazines that feature the typical Asian HOTTIES more than the content.

There was an LCD on showing the local game while soothing Music plays through the speakers.  This setup and feel has the same ideals of another Bubble Tea Shop \"Green Grotto\" except instead of LCD, they have a Fooseball Table there instead.

Hot Honey Ti Quan Yin Tea came in a Glass Mug rather than my expected Tea Pot but it was nice to warm up before moving on and CHILL...."}
{"text":"Average drinks and dessert (tried the toast with condense milk).

A very relaxing place to wind down after a busy and hectic day.  It was pretty empty and clean. Servers were nice and prompt.  They ran out of the drink I wanted though (cloudy oolong tea).  Drinks were in takeout cups even though we were dining in.

$4 per person minimum charge after 6pm Monday to Friday and weekends.

Sometimes you just want to enjoy a drink away from the busy city life and this place is the place to be."}
{"text":"I went and picked up a pudding milk tea with tapioca.  When I took the first sip of my drink the first thought that crossed my mind was it tasted bland.  My second observation was that there was no ice in my bubble tea.  All my pudding milk bubble tea just slightly tasted like pudding.  I ended up having to discard it due to the fact that it just wasn't good.  

The tapioca was ok but tasted a bit funny in them at it lacked the chewy texture I'm used to.  I like the different size bubble but the small ones just didn't have any texture other than being slimy.

Overall, the quality really has gone down and I would say save your money and the mall bubble tea places are better."}
{"text":"The Iron Goddess Milk Tea is the best. I'm not a fan of too sweet drinks though, and their tapioca is pretty sweet, so I normally ask them to just skip the sugar. All of their other teas are pretty good! My next favorite is the oolong milk tea."}
{"text":"Did management change? I feel like quality has gone downhill. 

Won't return again as there are much better bbt options close by."}
{"text":"After coming here twice and hearing a horror accident from my friend last month... I've decided to skip Serissa and go elsewhere for my BBT needs.

Both times I came - one early afternoon and one busy Saturday evening, they were out of the large tapioca balls.... the reason I was first enticed by this place was because their drinks offered a mixture of large and small tapiocas.... the fact that both times I was left with one option really lets me down.

The first time - I came for a red bean black tea which was partially blended and I was overall pretty happy (minus the combo tapioca). none the less, a little disappointed but willing to give it a second chance.

second time, I came for one of their special drinks and it clearly did not state that milk was included as one of their ingredients. When one of their items clearly states: MILK TEA, and one does not indicate MILK, I would assume that THERE IS NO MILK!

That clearly was not the case and I ended up with a drink that I was not expecting to get. That being said and the lack of large tapioca balls really was the last straw.

Won't be coming back any time soon .... there are way too many competitors to keep me loyal.. especially when I am not satisfied at the end of the day."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is decent. I like that they have mixed sizes of bubbles. It doesn't affect the taste or texture really but I just find it to be a nice change. 
Sometimes my bubble tea is really really really sweet and then other times it's really bitter. So I recommend getting the slush bubble drinks instead. Those always turn out the same for me. 

Nothing much special on the menu. Service is fast. Food is average. I'd rather go elsewhere for better bubble tea at a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Cozy little spot.  People can play card games and computer games here.  Drinks are ok."}
{"text":"A quieter BBT place with low tables and comfortable padded couches to lounge around in for a couple hours. I like this place because it never seems too busy or rowdy and the music tends to be soothing rather than obnoxiously loud (like another well know place). The drink menu is your typical choices of syrupy sweet drinks. A couple magazines to flip through if you are bored, but there is always the free WiFi."}
{"text":"PROS: You can stay there for hours on end, and it's surprisingly not TOO busy.  They also play really good music (in my opinions).

CONS: bubble tea isn't that great; and everything is WAY too overpriced.  Don't expect a lot of popcorn chicken if you're planning to get that.  It's overly oily, and you don't get a lot for the price."}
{"text":"My one star may seem harsh but I assure you it is accurate.  

1.  9/11 drink orders were wrong
2. popcorn chicken was not edible as seen in the yelp photos

its not like the shop was overly busy.  the wait staff could have just validated our orders after the fourth wrong order.  would not recommend when there are so many quality bbt shops around like ZenQ, chatime, and cha me cha."}
{"text":"I like this place, so it is 3.5 stars.

I compare it to Green Grotta in the same plaza.  I ordered a Moccachino, and it was as good as Second Cup/Starbucks'.  My BF had a Black Tea with Mandarin Orange Lemon, the flavour was strong and unmistakable; it was not very sweet and that I like.  I like the chairs/sofas.  They are comfy.  There is free WIFI; just ask for the password.

Generally, I like Serissa over Green Grotta that is in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Its a nice place to quench your thirst during a hot day. I don't think this combo was ever ordered before as bubble tea but we got it. Passion fruit tea with egg pudding. $4.24 for large and $0.90 for the egg pudding. This combo definately tasted weird at first but it grew on me. There is a good amount of seats and there are a few snacky foods available."}
{"text":"I'm just going to summarize my review.

Drink selection is decent but taste wise they are not very strong. Original milk tea has a funny taste I cannot quite pinpoint and it's my usual to go in bbt places. 

Food selection is next to none. Only have noodles and minced pork rice. 

Seat selection is minimal. Place is kind of small and it's usually packed during the afternoon and night and the place gets loud. 

Prices is about the same as other tea shops in the area. Regular drinks over 5 bucks, large at just under 7 after taxes. I really don't find good value here."}
{"text":"2.5/5

I've always passed by Serissa when I'm on Highway 7, as well as the one at Metro Square. My friends raved to me about how it's a very good bubble tea place, so I decided to try this afternoon.

We seated ourselves, as there was no server when we arrived...you can kinda guess where this is going at. 10 minutes later, we finally got our orders taken after waving our hands around. 2 of our drinks arrived within 15 minutes, however the third drink didn't arrive until 45 minutes later!!! My friend was quite irritated at the service we received, and I don't blame him as nobody took the initiative to approach us throughout the whole time we were there.

The drinks tasted okay. I personally enjoyed the tapioca (particularly the different sizes) than the drinks themselves. However the lack of service overshadowed what was overall a mediocre experience here, and I will not go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"I don't usually like my bubba but their tapoica is somehow better than other places. Maybe cause it mixed sizes or it's softer I don't even know. Either way good bubbles and their tea flavor variety is pretty unique, I tried their peach black tea which was alright nothing noteworthy but their manderin green bubble too was sooo refreshing the black iron goddess or whatever you call it was good too make sure you try it with the tapoica though or it's just gonna be $5 black milk tea with a strange name

POSITIVES: Drinks arent overtly sweet, quiet location, clean+pretty decent decor, free wifi, staff won't bother you
VS
NEGATIVES: Prices are a little high(like $4 for a small), staff aren't gonna baby you if you're into that

Good place to study, a 3.7 out of 5 for me"}
{"text":"Serissa Cate (not Cafe) is my favourite bubble tea house in Markham! Small location but offers a nice variety of hot and cold specialty mixed drinks, quick snacks, small meal combos and light desserts. I prefer this chic and modern location over the other 2 Serissa locations: 1) Pacific Mall - take outs only. 2) Metro Square - cozy place with wooden furniture.

Pretty good price for drinks I gotta say! Make sure you order a LARGE, only a $0.50 difference and you get quality AND quantity ^o^ Also, I absolutely love the mixture of small and large tapioca in their bubble tea drinks - gives it a nice chewing texture #nomnomnom. If you do take-outs for drinks, they have a stamp card system (Buy 8 get 1 Free!), so be sure to ask them for one. Apparently, drinks cost even less when you order take outs #greatnews :D

Here are a few of my favourite drinks, give them a try!
- Iron Goddess Milk tea with tapioca #lovelovelove
- White Chocolate Moccachino with tapioca
- Red Bean Slush / Black Sesame Slush with tapioca
- Taro Slush with egg pudding... yes I'm a big slush fan :)
- The Oz (Green Tea Slush with egg pudding, topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce woohooo! #droolz #spoiled lol)

Overall, I give this place a 4-star for friendly service and always have consistency in serving quality food and drinks. Minus 1 star for slow service sometimes... they only have 1 barista and 1 waitress on duty... but they are a hardworking pair! But it doesn't bother me much, my friends and I are too busy killing each other at monopoly deal XD

P.S. Unlike other bubble tea houses, Serissa allows you to play card games or board games! Sweet :D"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as Gal's Sushi.
This place has mediocre drinks, so nothing special. Their food is pretty bad tbh. Not a lot of choices and prices are also quite high as well.

The atmosphere however is really nice and it makes a wonderful studying place during the day! Seats are comfy and decor is nice! :)

Most people come here at night to have drinks with friends, so it can get busy. 

Wouldn't recommend anyone to come for food but it's an ok place to chill with your friends!"}
{"text":"I would say Serissa is my go to cafe for studying.  The bubble tea is consistent and I love the mixed sizes for tapioca.  However, the service is a hit or miss - they'll either come take your order right away and have your drink out pronto OR they ignore you until you flag them down & by the time your bubble tea comes you're about done studying anyway.
The cafe itself is spacious but the parking lot is horrendous - there's a lot of other restaurants in the plaza & it's a constant brawl trying to cop a spot.  
& ps. the food isn't worth it here."}
{"text":"Why Serissa Cate spells that way?? I really have no clue... I almost think someone cannot spell like me.. but really I look at their signs it is really spell Cate... 

Another Chinese Tea house serving Chinese Tea, Flavoured Tea (like the one I am drinking now... Mandarin Lemon), Italian coffees, Black Diamond Ice Crash in various flavours... 

Taiwanese Teen Pop music filling the whole Cafe... don't expect tranquillity or quiet here. 

Good Fast reliable Free WIFI access.. YAY! I am using their WIFI sipping my mega sweet tea/juice like drinks and writing this reviews and posting the photos! 

BTW, ask the staffs for the internet access keys, then you will be all set!"}
{"text":"just so so the drinks are a little bit overpriced but the decor and service were great"}
