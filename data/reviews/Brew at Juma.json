{"text":"Excellent place for coffee, tea or a snack. Fantastic customer service. Interesting atmosphere.   Great alternative to the chains."}
{"text":"Lovely space, decently priced tea, nice place to work in."}
{"text":"Awesome little gem of a coffee house. Great ambiance and feel for an afternoon coffee and snack. Everyone was extremely friendly. The attached gallery had lovely pieces of jewelry, clothing, and ceramics, however they are bit on the more expensive side. I did not have lunch there but they do serve a light lunch that looked delicious. I would not hesitate to stop by again!"}
{"text":"A wonderful spot to spend the day working! The music is mellow, there are plenty of outlets, and the coffee is great! I got the curry chicken salad sandwich and it was absolutely delicious! If you're looking for a break from chain coffee shops, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Love our neighborhood spot. Friendly, good coffee, and a great place to meet neighbors for coffee or lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, super chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great coffee in an urban-artsy atmosphere.   Long overdue in this part of the city.  Offers all local food, great music on a decent sound system.  I could spend all morning here.  Hoping you all will patronize this place so they will extend their hours, currently open until 8 pm  Proves that not EVERYTHING cool is only in Tremont or Ohio City!"}
{"text":"The espresso is from another planet! Very good and very STRONG! Excellent service and very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent all-around.  The quality of coffee at this place rivals Rising Star.  All goodies are provided by Philomena Bake Shop and Cleveland Bagel...both 5-star as well.  Probably the coolest designed coffeehouse in Cleveland...no joke.  Staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  The attached clothing store has some killer cool stuff in it.  When I go Herr I end up spending $1,000 for my latte!  Sadly,  no coconut milk...so that was the only mini tear I shed while ordering my latte."}
{"text":"Juma is close by our new residence and it's quite a discovery. A combination of a coffeehouse, upscale women's wear and housewares shops in three conjoined buildings. Coffee is great, food for lunch is very good. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came in here with my husband on a rainy day looking for some caffeine. We not only found a solid chai latte and mocha, it was relaxing and the atmosphere was chill. We were surrounded by a variety of people enjoying their morning and working.  They have a variety of drinks as well as some food including clam chowder and Cleveland bagels and an assortment of pastries.   Looking for a nice place to start your morning? Look no further."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee house, with great coffee, Cleveland bagels, and nice outside seating. My favorite place in the area! The smoothies are tasty, too."}
{"text":"I have shopped at the gallery but I never went to Juma just for the coffee. I took my journal, had a good cup of drip & a yummy scone. The atmosphere is chill. The art adds to the vibe. I will return -- including for happy hour --Purely for research though"}
{"text":"Ordered iced coffee, received a nitro brew and paid for it without being told. Asked if they had iced coffee and they told me no, so I was stuck with a drink I paid for and did not want.   My friends ordered iced tea which the barista made by pouring water over tea bags on ice... so the tea didn't brew at all resulting in little taste. The \"matcha\" tea was just green tea with no matcha included whatsoever.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great quality coffee, and they have delicious lunch options. The atmosphere is nice; soft music, new artwork every month or so and pretty plants. As an added bonus they almost always have free samples of their very tasty pastries/cookies/bars!"}
{"text":"Needed to stop in to grab coffee, get on my laptop computer for work and take some calls - also was starving for something to eat. I waited in line, looked of the menu, was first disappointed at not much offering to eat (don't serve until 10). There was a section called Noshes that included an antipasta for $4 (served from 7am to 3pm). I asked for that when I ordered and they said they don't serve that until 11. I showed THEIR menu to them and said I chose this from the Noshes section that's served from 7-3. The young man asked the other employee who said, \"not till 11\". Which also differs from the menu, which's states lunch is at 10 - but this WASN'T a lunch item, it was one of there \"Noshes\". Anyway - move on to backup plan, coffee with heavy cream because the cream will hold me over. They give me my coffee woh room for cream but never added the heavy cream. I went to the condiments and additives and there was only milk and half-n-half. I asked the guy who seems to be running the front and he states \"heaviest thing we have is half-n-half\". Backup plan failed, and this this place failed at being an actual coffee cafe, how do you not carry heavy cream and how do you not put out a menu with correct KEY IMPORTANT information. Now I'm stuck here with nothing to eat and not even the sustainment of a coffee with heavy cream. Why did I not grab a Bagel or Muffin? Because I'm on the Keto diet (low carb low sugar). That's why I didn't give out a one star, I understand my diet and eating habits were part of why this was a difficult experience."}
{"text":"Our favorite coffee house in Shaker. Plus has a fabulous boutique, gallery attached.  Music on Thursday nights. Wine and beer also."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. The service here is fantastic, the vibe is excellent, they have nice cushiony seating and tables for people to spread out and study. When it's a \"lunch rush\" it might get a bit louder, but it doesn't bother someone like me who doesn't mind noise. It might be loud for someone who needs peace and quiet to study, but if that's the case, its hard to understand why you'd study at a coffee shop.  Anyway, this place is a nice change of pace from a lot of chain coffee places. Theres artwork on the walls I think are for sale and the coffee shop is connected to a clothing store so if you need a short break between chapters you can take a walk around and browse (the clothing store is a bit overpriced if you ask me).   I ordered an Americano and a chocolate chip cookie (sandwich?) that was on display. The cookie is REALLY sweet ( I mean it's a lot of chocolate), but it's nice with the bitterness of the Americano."}
{"text":"This is a really cool cafe. They have outdoor and indoor seating. I stopped by to work on a paper I was writing. It was like a moderate noise level-so quiet enough to focus on light work if you don't have a pair of headphones for music. The staff was really nice and the service was quick. My regular at any coffee place is a hot hazelnut soy latte. Let me tell you that was the best hazelnut soy latte I have ever had! It was smooth and i could actually taste the hazelnut flavor. To go with the latte I ordered a vegan brownie. I'm not a vegan at all but tbh you could not tell the difference between a regular brownie and their vegan brownie. It was moist chocolately and delightful! So yes it is a little more $ than a Dunkin coffee and a donut but it was so worth it.   Another cool feature of the cafe is that it is attached to a boutique and the boutique is quite interesting in terms of fashion seems to have a vintage theme. They also have art an gallery for local artists in the cafe part. So lots to see here. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"This place has great hand baked goods, a friendly outgoing staff and high-quality coffee. It also has a great atmosphere. Please patronize this wonderful independent coffee house"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite place in Cleveland, this cafe has been a godsend while I study for the bar. Perfect amount of traffic, good vibes, great music, and fantastic espresso and coffee. What sets this place apart from all others I've been to in the rust belt are the people that work here. Nick and everyone else are just phenomenal humans."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop in Shaker.  They have several light to dark coffee choices. I had an Ethiopian blend with a hint of spices and chocolate.  They also have iced drinks, mochas, and expresso.  They have bagels from Cleveland Bagel Company and doughnuts from Lucy's.  I enjoyed a salted bagel with chive cream cheese.  The bagel had a great crunch on the outside, but tasted fresh and warm inside.  The chive cream cheese was also very good.   The music over the speakers was upbeat, but not to loud for the early morning crowd.  They have a large table near the front door/ window with butcher block paper and crayons to entertain younger guests.  The walls are covered with art from local artist and there is an open wall where you can enter the cute store next door (same owner)."}
{"text":"Love coming to this coffeeshop to study! The service and drinks are fantastic, the food and bakery are delicious.  It can get a little loud, but I suppose if it's that good it will bring a comparable crowd!"}
{"text":"Very nice cozy spot to enjoy some coffee and a bagel."}
{"text":"I had time to kill in the morning, so pulled into Starbucks by Green Rd. with the lot filled to the brim as usual. So I searched and wondered if there were alternatives, and lo' and behold I found this lovely, non-crowded, quaint, unique coffee shop that is connected to a boutique and gallery. The coffee was sophisticated. I ordered a soy latte made with espresso beans crushed right there and then. I'd put this up there with Pacific and all 3rd wave coffee shops out there. Go against the flow my friends."}
{"text":"I go to coffee shops nearly everyday and the coffee here tasted great. My mocha could have used more chocolate though. This place has a nice aesthetic too. However, I got some bad customer service from the black guy with glasses. He was unwelcoming and rolled his eyes when I asked question. Total dick."}
{"text":"Lovely space with lots of light, I bet it's great when the weather is nice. It's unique in that it's connected to a clothing and home goods shop. They offer a variety of pastries, including Cleveland Bagel Co. bagels. I grabbed a slice of banana bread which had good texture but not a ton of flavor. I sipped on a chai latte with almond milk which wasn't especially good and my husband's vanilla latte was so-so. I would return for the ambiance, especially to meet someone but not for the drinks."}
{"text":"So i know it is a coffee house and you probably really care about how the coffee is. Well, the coffee is great I've been twice now and I get an almond milk vanilla latte. It's a strong cup of coffee and its the perfect temperature (no taste buds lost on the first sip).  The star of the show for me is the cranberry bread. the cranberries are tart but the bread is sweet, it's hardy from the walnuts (which are chopped into small pieces). Everything just works together seamlessly. It is literally the best cranberry bread I have ever had.  i forgot to mention it is also a boutique, I've only been early so it isn't open. you can see it from the coffee house and it looks really cute."}
{"text":"The hummus plate is DELICIOUS... (we actually came back for the hummus plate). The coffee is great- strong and well made...and the customer service was so great, I decided to write this review. Places like this deserve the praise."}
{"text":"Had a very weird experience to say the least. Stopped in for our first visit today. I felt like I did something wrong walking in today. The barista was VERY off putting. There was 0 friendliness or welcoming atmosphere. He did not greet us, he seemed extremely annoyed that we walked in, he sighed multiple times after we ordered. Why such a bad attitude? I told him it was our first time in, and was surprised to see that he wasn't more welcoming. Or at all. If it wasn't for the coffee, I might not even give it another shot. He had someone else assist him, but that gentleman was also very unfriendly. No one said thank you, no one even seemed to care that we came in to give them business. All we received was an attitude, for no reason what so ever. I work in customer service, and even on my worst days I don't take it out on my customers. It's not like we walked in the door at closing time. Fix your customer service! If you want to close down early or something, then lock your door instead."}
{"text":"I love trying new coffee shops and was really excited to hit Juma today. Unfortunately, the person who \"greeted\" us and made our coffee could not have been much less enthusiastic or friendly. Our vanilla lattes were decent, but the poor attitude made me less likely to come back."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and is a perfect example of why it's important to support our small businesses. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the food lives up to the expectation that the atmosphere sets. High quality, artsy goods are a room away."}
{"text":"Liked this little place, emphasis on little. That's why I only gave the coffee joint 4 stars, not very much space. The music they were playing was right up my alley though (Motown)!  I enjoyed a large iced Americano & the barista threw in an extra shot of espresso for free because I said I like it strong (how nice!). I also had an oat & date bar which I think was homemade and delicious as well.   All & all a cute place, just don't plan to have a table to yourself!"}
{"text":"While staying at the Cleveland Marriott East Hotel in Warrensville Heights - I was in need/want of caffeine on multiple days. I asked the front desk at the hotel if they had any recommendations for locally owned coffee shops - they were unaware of any - so to the Yelp App on my iPhone I went!  Juma comes up as being 2.5 miles from the hotel. I asked the hotel staff if they were familiar with Juma - they were not. Juma has lots of good ratings - So off to Juma I go!  There is a parking lot around back - along with two entrances. I took the entrance to the left - and found myself in a clothing store. Confused, but undeterred, I continued on until I found the section of Juma that is a coffee house.  I ordered their version of a cold brew - they pour a certain amount in a cup and then cut it with water. It's super strong! I came in the first day around 4:00 pm in the afternoon - and I was wired for longer than I wanted to be - meaning I was still partially wired when I wanted to go to sleep later that evening!  They also offer some baked goods, and there is plenty of seating. They have installed a garage door that is open during the day to the street - so lots of fresh air and sunlight streaming in the front.  I've been back a couple more times during my stay! Very cool little coffee shop! The folks working here are very nice! Check them out!"}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems around Shaker Heights. As I walk to the local playroom I like to stop in here to grab a quick coffee (usually sorely needed). They are quick & friendly,  and espresso based drinks are up to snuff, not bitter or watery. Their cold brew is hella strong so leave room for milk if you can't take it. Tasty cakes and cookies also make for a quick snack, and they have a limited menu for lunch as well (mainly soups and sandwiches/wraps).   Seating inside is about 20 people I'd say, mostly small tables but one long communal table by the baristas. There's a neat shop connected to the cafe, wish I had time to browse around more!"}
{"text":"Best latte around this area- also a cute little shop to answer some emails or study in. And what a great little selection of baked goods! They have a unique clothing store there that's a little older than my style but my mom loves it. Great place!"}
{"text":"Eh I wanted to like this place I really did but they don't offer too many flavors that go with my latte. When I did try it the vanilla iced latte it just tasted like the smell of bleach even after a new cup with more milk with more syrup. Maybe it's too robust for me? I'm not sure but I wish they had more sweeter options on the menu or they tried tweaking their drinks a bit more. Forgot to add that the one guy that works there is super unapproachable and not very pleasant, after the second drink didn't taste right I didn't feel comfortable going up a third time to revamp my drink so I just threw it away and left."}
{"text":"I've been going to Juma for the past three days straight. The ambience is amazing, the space is great, and I absolutely cannot wait for the patio to open. The tables and chairs are really comfortable, and the space is just great.   Their coffee is great, too. I usually get the Irish Creme coffee, which has a really nice flavor to it. Coffee is great and all their tea smells amazing. I've also had their food, which was all great. Chicken curry salad is one of my favorites. Their soups always taste good and so do their quiches.. The only negative thing would be that their bagel in the bagel and lox was really hard, so I couldn't really finish the bagel.   If you want a nice space to study or chat with your friends or even to just spend a little quiet time alone, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"While working at Bicycle Boulevard I went to Juma often for a cup of coffee. The service is always friendly and quick. They were always happy to fill my travel mug and avoid another disposable cup in the trash, and the coffee is always good. The music choices are often pretty excellent as well. The attached store is high end and therefore not for me, but the coffee shop is tops."}
{"text":"I am an occasional visitor to Shaker Heights and stumbled upon this local coffee house one afternoon.  After the closing of the local Starbucks and Panera Bread shops over the past few years, the area was devoid of areas to grab a cup of quality coffee.  (A local gas station and Wendy's seem to be the only other options.)  Juma offers typical coffee house fair like fresh scones, bagels and muffins, as well as a variety of soups and salads.  The atmosphere is laid back with soft lighting and artwork on the walls.  It's definitely more suited towards hanging out with a laptop to work or study in groups, appointed with lots of tables and chairs as opposed to overstuffed couches and chairs for lounging.  The noise level changes from library quiet to vibrant buzz as people come and go.  A lot of the patrons seemed to be regulars who know each other by name, and you can get a sense for local politics and issues by listening to their conversations."}
{"text":"Very cute inside and great lattes! Their espresso has a great flavor that comes through any type of milk you chose for your latte. I ordered an almond milk latte!"}
{"text":"Everyone at this coffee shop was very friendly. I walked in the back and was greeted by two people.   The shop has a basic espresso menu, bakery and some lunch items as well.   There is a boutique of gift / houseware items, handmade plate ware and men's and women's clothing next door. I wandered through after ordering my coffee and the cashier actually brought me my coffee in the boutique which was very nice.   The coffee shop itself has a patio in the front and a spacious interior with lots of tables and seating options including a long cushioned bench.   I tried the Americano this time which was very good and smooth. Next visit I think I'll go for the Chai Latte.   There is a large parking lot in rear shared by other businesses in the strip."}
{"text":"As Spring weather blooms in Cleveland, I can now take full advantage of this caffeinated oasis only a ten-minute walk from our home. I have made it a regular stop to switch up my working-from-home routine and my affection for Juma grows with time.  The coffee and espresso are top-notch and the local munchies are a continual source of delight. The service is always warm and friendly! I always enjoy the time I spend sitting in the dining room: it is lively enough to provide some people-watching enjoyment, yet sedate enough for me to work.  There is only one problem that I have encountered: on 2 of my last 4 visits to Juma, I have left, not only with a coffee, but with an unplanned purchase of something fabulous from the boutique! If you're impulsive like I am, your cup of coffee could end up costing you upwards of $50.00, so be prepared!   In all seriousness, though, the boutique really is delightful! It's a perfect place to shop for gifts or just a treat for yourself! I'm so glad that Juma is a part of my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really great spot that my partner and I stopped at on our way through town. The staff were very friendly, the space is great, and both the coffee and the bagels (the bagels!) were fantastic.   Recommended spot."}
