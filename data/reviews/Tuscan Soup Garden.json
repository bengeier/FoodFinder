{"text":"I work very close to this soup and sandwich shop and I eat here at least twice a week.  I always get the chipolte chicken wrap.  Personally, I prefer the wraps over the sandwiches. The wraps are filling and fresh. Its a great place for a quick lunch and a warm soup."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and quick which kept me coming back at least twice a month. But I think they could improve their customer service.  Never a smile or thanks for coming back. Nobody is friendly in this joint! And the last time I opened my wallet and pulled out a twenty and he grabbed it out of my hand. I thought that's the last time I go there.  If I patronize place often I expect to at least treated nice. I will patronize places in the area that appreciate my business. I don't want to go to a place that I dread going to. Yikes!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick lunch that isn't fast-food look no further...This little hidden gem is worth stopping by if you're in the area.  Today was my second time stopping in at the Tuscan Soup Garden and I must say I'm having a hard time restricting myself to the occasional trip with it being so close to work.  The menu is mostly sandwiches, wraps, and three or four soups for the day.  Today's special was a mexican taco style wrap that sounded delicious - seasoned ground beef, sour cream, salsa, corn, and an assortment of vegetables.  There were four soups today but I saw the broccoli cheese and nothing else registered after that - they had my favourite so why look at anything else?  They warm the tortilla so that it rolls properly, they don't have to wrap it in foil or paper like other places because it stays in shape on its own!  The wrap is stuffed as much as possible and today's mexican taco style was delicious.  Well seasoned, fresh produce, and great salsa.  The soup was fresh, balanced and creamy.  The meal is produced so efficiently that I had plenty of time to sit back and read a book while eating before the short walk back to work, without feeling rushed.  Just pleasantly stuffed...  I only get a small soup or they would have to roll me down the drive back to work.  Delicious, quick, and healthy.  I am glad this is the closest place to work, they will see me often I'm sure!"}
