{"text":"Food was good. Place is clean and people were friendly. The only complaint is that the waitress needs more training. She tried hard, just was scattered. Brought our food out to the wrong table and 5 minutes later it shows up at our table. Needless to say it wasn't exactly hot at that point. My daughter's whip cream on her pancake was completely melted and unrecognizable. We had to ask for water three different times to two different people and it finally showed up many minutes later. The prices were OK and you do get a lot of food. So, train the wait staff better and it could be a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch...and well...it's clean, staff was friendly enough but it was dump and go and they auctioned off plates.  One in our party got their food well after everyone else  (special of the day no less!), food was edible. .. but the prices high for what it is.  It tastes like it all came from a food service company....no thought to it.  Overly salty and premade. Clam chowder was pastey.   Portions were good.  Menu just has too many things so it does nothing well.   I think we were the only table with anyone under the age of 60.  Nice try.....but we won't be back unless we hear of major changes."}
{"text":"We just had our second breakfast here in as many weeks. This is a new restaurant in our area and we always get excited by that. There is plenty to choose from on the menu. We've tried their pancakes and French toast as well as rib eye and eggs and even a Benedict dish and biscuits  and gravy. Come here to find all of the usual suspects and more. The service has been great. You will never starve for attention here. Our server Sierra was very nice, funny, and even tolerant. Honestly we would come back here just to have here wait on us again. 
Hmmmm what will we order next time??"}
{"text":"Not sure what they are going for. The food I've had has been good not great. The menu is insanely large, so theres something for everyone."}
{"text":"Huge menu makes it hard to choose but what we had was great and a fantastic value. Big portions suitable for sharing, will be back"}
{"text":"We have visited Morelia's twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. Both times we found them quite good. Service is good and the food was excellent (cafe style).  

Breakfast:
We tried the California Benedict and the California crepes. The poached eggs were done correctly (not simple) and the hollandaise good. The California crepe was 2 crepes filled with eggs vegis and avocados; they were HUGE.  Coffee was good, not premium but not bad at all.  Hashbrowns were top notch. My only qualm was that the avocados weren't quite ripe. 

Dinner:
Gyro panini and Friday fish fry.  Fish was good, not the best in Madison but good. Gyro panini was good. Both came with a chicken and dumpling soup, surprisingly good and seemed homemade.  Only bad thing was surprisingly the water, they desperately need a water filter.

Overall it's very good and we will go back. They could use a little decoration but the food is solid, portions huge, and service good.  I hope they do well."}
{"text":"My bride and I were here for breakfast around 11am-ish

Our meals were not really impressive.  My wife ordered the chicken-fried steak with hash browns; that turned out to be pretty good except for the hash browns arriving five minutes after the rest of the food and being on the not-so-hot side.  I had a bacon omelet, which looked like it might have originally come in a cellophane wrapper -- it looked mass-produced, and I had to look for the pieces of bacon.  Both of our breads came \"buttered\" with something that tasted more oily than buttery.

The service, unfortunately, was less than reliable; it took two requests to get another set of silverware to our table; my wife's hashbrowns were delivered five minutes after the rest of her breakfast; the server asked if I wanted a refill on my soft drink, I replied in the affirmative, and the refill never happened.  (I was asked again by the same server when she delivered the check.  Kinda late for that?)

I'm just unimpressed by Morelia's; the combination of spotty service and boring food just didn't put a smile on my face,  I'm sure there are better places for breakfast in and around town."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Came here with my family for dinner one night. Maybe they should stick to breakfast because I've heard really good things about their breakfast options. 

I ordered a wrap, and to be honest I couldn't eat it. It was soggy, and nothing like what it stated on the menu. Everyone else ate their food but again they were not impressed with the flavor or quality of the food. 

I may or may not give them another shot. If I do, I am ordering breakfast."}
{"text":"We walked in around noon on a Sunday. It was fairly busy but we were seated by the owner immediately. Service was better than average. The servers were busy because if the lunch crowd, but they were friendly. It seemed new, clean, but not fancy. The food was very good, but not gourmet. Everything was hot and freshly made. The pricing was good. It's a good deal , fresh, hot, good service, fast, and the menu is full of feel-good items."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with out of town family. The food was ok. It was very bland but probably works well in this community. 7 of us are and nothing about the food really stood out. We had salads, burgers, fish, quesadilla, ice cream, soup and a few other items. The beer was cold, the service was good. I would like to come back and try breakfast sometime. Can you go wrong with Bacon & Eggs. I'm not giving it a bad review because for someone else the food may be perfect. I just prefer more flavor."}
