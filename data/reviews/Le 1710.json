{"text":"Save yourself the trip into Vaudreuil and have a tasty breakfast here in town.  Large variety of delicious food and friendly service. The portions are large so bring your appetite!  Recommend:the 1710 for him and the classic smoked salmon benedict for her."}
{"text":"Visited this place today and all I can say is smiles all-around :) - Warm reception, exceptional friendliness, generous portions, good clean food, and a really amazing find in this neighbourhood.

This place is being managed by new administration, and I think that is a good thing.  It was a beautiful day for a drive and thought to give this place a visit.  It was nice just driving up to this place...it felt like I was going for a day to sugaring-off with the trees whizzing by to my left and right.  

The exterior of the place is whitish/pale yellow so it was easy to find.  There is a terrace along the road and has sufficient seating.  Decided to sit indoors (entrance is at the side, via parking lot - see photos).  Immediately see what is, or was, a coat check area (the resto may have been a bar in a previous life time), and the counter was lined with today's newspapers - various selection in Eng and Fre.  Pick one up, and get quickly greeted by the owner.  Immediate seating at a booth.  I love how upon walking in that everything just seems so familiar.  Seems they have a lot of regulars as the owner seem to remember each client as they walked-in and got seated - Us included, he came to every table and asked how everything was doing and made sure our experience was a happy one and took in any comments that we had.

I can see how the place was full with clients of every age, and party size.  Reservations are possible as well.  This weekend they had a holiday special for St Jean Baptist.  Was served by 2 waitresses - both quick and efficient.  Very friendly - always a smile, and attentive.  Constant attention to filling up our coffee mugs - coffee is a-ok.  Ordered the Chef's Choice from the holiday menu: 2 eggs, 1 meat, 3 crepes - which came with an abundance of fruits and cream, and asked for my potatoes without onion.  My partner ordered 2 eggs, and 1 meat, came with potatoes.  Tea and/or coffee is included.  The service was very fast and came fresh and hot.  I just loved how much fruit that came on top of my crepes, and I have to give kudos on the variety as well!  (Apple, oranges, strawberries, grapes, cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple, banana, and blueberries!)

Overall, I am impressed.  Good job!  I will most definitely recommend, and will become a repeat customer. No need to go into Vaudreuil for a meal - they serve breakfast and lunch (took a peek and saw that they have a wood oven, must try their pizza at my next visit!)"}
{"text":"They make your typical run-of-the-mill bacon & eggs breakfast but you get a lot of food for a pretty low price. You can easily have a large breakfast for 2 for under $20. My partner personally really likes the potatoes more than any other breakfast restaurant in the area."}
