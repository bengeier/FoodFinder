{"text":"Had a delicious lunch with my husband today!  Love the the new contemporary decor.  Rose did a lovely job bringing a classic restaurant into the 21st Century!"}
{"text":"Great food and environment. Tried two different small plates and both were good."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved into the area and have come to Pearl for two dinners in the last two weeks. The food has been delicious each time. The shrimp toast, the egg roll, the Eight Jewel Chicken and the Vegetables Delight are excellent. Sheri, our server both evenings was terrific! Prices are good, especially for the generous amount of food. Two meals for the price of one. We love Pearl!"}
{"text":"This beloved neighborhood landmark has made a big mistake by trying to do a major overhaul on the cheap. New location with modern decor is a much needed change. Pared down menu to focus on their strengths is a good idea. Unfortunately the execution of both the decor and food were disappointing. Too many different shades of red with a pale green awkwardly thrown into the sleek modern mix. Cheap chairs and faded chinaware (from the old restaurant?) are just sad. The food: scallion pancakes were greasy, pad thai was a huge bowl of tasteless rice noodles and poached (?) chicken breast with NO sauce, but the Empress chicken was quite tasty and the highlight of our meal."}
{"text":"Disappointing.   I ordered delivery (pad thai) and it came so underseasoned that I was actually digging through my fridge for fish sauce and lime (since no lime wedges were included) to try and salvage it.  I ended up throwing most of it away.  For maybe the second time in my life, I called the restaurant to complain and was treated in a very condescending manner.   With so many other options in the area, I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"What was once a pretty good restaurant is no longer.  The place was empty on a Saturday night and should have been the red flag for us.  But we went for it and should not be surprised that we were disappointed.  None of the food was delivered hot, despite the fact that the kitchen couldn't have been too busy to heat up soup or egg rolls.  The main course, Happy Family, was thankfully served on a sizzling platter.  However, it was somewhat bland and lacking seasoning.  
Won't be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is our second time here at The Pearl Asian Kitchen, formerly Pearl of the Orient. Last time we started with the Shrimp Chips and Shrimp Toast and my wife had the Eight Jewel Chicken and I had the Kung Pao Pearl. The food was excellent but the Mai Tai cocktail was just okay. This time I had an Egg Roll which was one of the best I've ever had and the Hoisin BBQ Ribs which were moist and tasty. My wife had the Vegetables Delight that she loved. Our server both times was Sheri and she took very good care of us. 

We'll be back often and look forward to exploring more of the menu and possibly upgrading to five stars."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and can't remember a time I ever left disappointed. The egg rolls are giant and delicious. The Kung Pao dishes are unparalleled. I could drink the sauce. Chicken fried rice, Mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, eight jewel chicken -- I've yet to find something that doesn't satisfy."}
{"text":"Love the new location and ambience of this favorite restaurant. The owner, Rose Wong, is so welcoming, the service staff is attentive, and the food is fabulous!"}
{"text":"The new location for Pearl of the Orient East, excellent food, plus the new very light atmosphere is so pleasant. As always, the food is excellent and a wonderful value. My favorite Chinese  restaurant. ALSO a very long marble bar with television screens for very friendly atmosphere and more fun. Run run run to the Pearl. You will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"I come here about once or twice a month for lunch. Food is always good and quick and friendly service. Decor is modern and always clean. It's a great stop for lunch...I have to try it during dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"New location for what used to be the Pearl of the Orient across the road. Same staff and excellent food. Gone is the kitsch decor and now it's modern Asian."}
{"text":"The revival of Pearl of the Orient. Now Pearl
Asian. The menu has improved with more Asian choices. Walking distance in the new Van Aken District . We have enjoyed it a lot. Rose the owner is very welcoming. The service was great. Great menu and wonderful bar area. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for a quick lunch after I had a a job interview. And.... yum! Very attentive service, good wine (tad pricey by the glass, but that's to be expected) and the food was very good! All in all a lovely experience, I'd be happy to return. Oh and the food prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout over the phone. Restaurant itself is very nice, but the food I ordered was just terrible. Weirdest sweet and sour chicken I've ever had, more vegetables than chicken... mostly peppers. The chicken pieces were quite large, but dry and hard. Egg rolls were odd tasting, no sauce was given. The bill was over $70 and definitely not worth it. Will not be going here again. Sorry."}
{"text":"Only reason I gave it twe because the server was very efficient however the food was less than acceptable. I ordered sizzling beef came barely lukewarm the asparagus was cold that came with it and the portions were small. Not the same pearl of the Orient I used to remember. There were only three other customers  which makes me wonder why. My wife ordered  a Szechuan pork dinner and had very very little pork and virtually no taste I doubt if I'll come back"}
{"text":"Aubray was our server and was excellent. She was informative, efficient and attentive. I  had the pad Thai and was not disappointed. What really got me though, was the Won Ton! This has to be the best version I have ever tasted.  It was a very nice change from the usual small piece of meat overpowered by a large noodle.  Hats off to the entire crew!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Rose Wong's restaurants most of my life here on Earth...vs outer space!

Her early spot \"Amethyst Grill\" was classy but short lived.  Too bad, so sad. It was elegant.

Her long, long time spot across the street  \"Pearl of the Orient\" was a tried and true local spot for authentic Chinese Cuisine.  The staff was always polite and efficient, but the atmosphere and ambiance left something to be desired. Quite honestly, it had none.  A tiny lil bar for the rejects in the neighborhood to pour over a poorly made drink and a dark and dismal restaurant where you could hear every conversation of the dry and busy body crowd. It was ...well... MEH...

Now, onto the next chapter in her life, \"Pearl\"!!!!!!!
The atmosphere is Pretty, Chic and Inviting!  
The beautiful vibrant Red walls, artwork and furniture is another world from the Pearl of the Orient!  Thankful for the City rearranging the shopping center, this place is the New place to hang!

A long bar for the regulars or newbies to hang out! 
Happy Hour 7 days a week!
The menu has even been enhanced!

Managed by Jason, a long time friend and awesome young fella, Rose is back on her game!
Stop in, you will likely see me at some point.
This place is just wonderful and a Welcoming new spot in Shaker Heights!"}
{"text":"It's fine, nothing special. Standard Chinese fare. I came here for lunch, because it's close to my house."}
{"text":"TASTEBUD OVERLOAD!
This is a secret little gem in the Van Aken District. I hope it's not going anywhere with all the renovations going on. It's walking distance from the rapid and right in the heart of this up and up and coming area. I love the pad thai, egg drop soup and rice dishes. You just can't go wrong here! The owner is always greeting folks as they walk in and very on par with hospitality. I highly recommend trying out their great menu selection and drink specials."}
{"text":"I tried this tonight for take out on my way home from Cleveland driving to south Youngstown. The food was beautifully packed and was quite warm 1.5 hrs later when I arrived home. Shrimp toast=awesome!!! Mongolian beef= awesome!!! Orange Chicken= wonderful but the pieces are far too big, will not order again. I actually ordered from here because I saw Gailan on the menu (Chinese broccoli). I will definitely try again as it is on my long trek home from work everyday.
I was very impressed that the chekcnout clerk verifies all of the contents with me prior to purchase. That is customer service!!
Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"I am shocked at the qty of 5-star reviews on here.   I know that we're starved for good Chinese food in NE Ohio, but certainly we can do much better than Pearl?

I really really really want to like this restaurant.  It's so close and it's one of the few places that will deliver on Uber Eats.   I've even given it 4-5 tries just to make sure that I'm not mistaken, but it's still lacking.

Pad Thai: tastes like it's been made with spaghetti noodles and had little flavor
Moo Shu Pork: wasn't bad, but was clearly served with tortillas instead of pancakes
Crab Wontons: undercooked and soggy

I would recommend staying away!"}
{"text":"Congrats Rose & Bernie! New location in Shaker Heights is wonderfully bright & crisp & elegant! Stopped first at the bar, which is expansive with its white marble slabs, all the beverages against the white wall, the jade junk with red envelopes of luck. Started with the milkshake stout and shrimp toast appetizer (a delicious deep-fried surprise to this supposedly-dieting man). Can't wait for my wife to arrive so we can try some of the new dishes."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer since I was very young and it was called \"The Pearl of the Orient\". It's not the most authentic Chinese cuisine, but it's definitely flavorful. I've never eaten at this updated location, but I have had takeout several times. The sauce/gravy on the chicken with broccoli is my favorite and really flavorful. Least favorite dish is the wonton soup- the wontons are very odd."}
{"text":"Love the new Pearl.  Such a nice improvement on the other location.  This is our favorite Chinese restaurant both locally and nationally.  Its so nice that the owner is always present with a smile and hands on.  So rare today.  The food came out hot and fresh.  Such a great variety.  I usually don't do Chinese for lunch but a friend insisted on going there this Friday for lunch.  I hope its as great as their dinners."}
{"text":"This place is nice But.... I got there at 8:30  with acouple of friends,found out they are only open until ten!  So by the time we received our food and had 1 drink it was almost time to go. Who closes at 10pm? Saturday they close even earlier. The food was good but it took a while bringing it out."}
{"text":"I will never return to this restaurant ever again. Service was ok but the food was mediocre! Politely said. Frozen PF Changs from Walmart would have been better. I don't understand how they were so busy. The owner was walking around taking video of the restaurant. So tacky. Never again. I usually never write any reviews but I was just so disappointed. And for how much the meals were it just was not worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible. Pad Thai was made with vermicelli noodles and zero flavor. General Tso chicken, also zero flavor and huge dry over cooked pieces. Wonton soup had a strange synthetic plastic flavor. Never again. This place used to be amazing. What a shame."}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything about this restaurant! I have always enjoyed their food and am excited how they updated the decor of the restaurant. The bar area is much more inviting and they have some lovely options at happy hour. 

Their wonton soup is amazing and so are their egg rolls. Always ask for the house sweet and sour sauce! It is the best sweet and sour dipping sauce I have ever had.

Order the honey chicken - it is one of my favorites!! You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes."}
