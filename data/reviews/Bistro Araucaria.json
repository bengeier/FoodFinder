{"text":"Don't bother going unless it's just for drinks. We got the pastel de choclo ($14)which was supposedly the \"best\" dish off the menu. It was basically watery chicken and beef topped with creamed corn. It was served with stale wholemeal sandwich bread. The chicken and avocado sandwich ($5.50) was also tasteless and yet there was no salt or pepper on the table. The fries were limp ($3) and came with a very watery tomato ketchup.  The only decent thing was not made them - the beer ($6).  We came here by mistake intending to go to the place next door which happened to be closed. Next time, I'll check more carefully before grabbing a seat..."}
{"text":"Next door favorite Tachido was closed for lunch, so we sat out here for a patio lunch instead. The seafood empanada was really nice, but I'd look elsewhere.  Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"These lovely Chilean people came through for me on a catering job at the last minute. I had a very specific menu (definitely NOT Chilean) and they came through brilliantly. Every dish was amazing and the price was more than right. I'll add another review once I have a chance to get up there and taste their empanadas for which they have a variety of reviews on other sites. They're quite new and are still finding their feet from what I understand but, they came highly recommended and really saved my event."}
