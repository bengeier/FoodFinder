{"text":"Finally i find a place near my school that is great.
Service was amazing. Cashier was super friendly and nice.
Food was amazing. Fresh and full of flavor.
And price was great also.

Came for the food, will return for food+service

Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"delicious falafel sandwich. you can have one, two, three, four and still want another one. the best thing is that your wallet stays fat!"}
{"text":"Only 1 review on this place?!! 
For the lovely and affordable price of ONLY 2 dollars, you get soup, a felafel and a drink!!! 
Did I mention this gem is vegan friendly. Nilufar is definitely no frills when it comes to atmosphere, but WHO cares when you get a deal this reasonable and tasty. 

In fact there should be more of this in Montreal, our stomachs and pocket books would thank you."}
{"text":"This place is really great, you have really great food for cheap and the staff is friendly.
Went for the first time yesterday and will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2005. I could eat here daily- best falafel for the price, so great, so friendly, always busy & super quick. Love it!"}
{"text":"I was sightseeing in Downtown Montreal when I stumbled upon this family-run falafel joint.
Living in Los Angeles, I have had my share of falafels, but I have to say this one exceeded all expectations. It was crunchy on the outside and soft and green on the inside. You have to get them fresh while they are hot and crispy. The side dishes are awesome too. They serve mostly Mediterranean vegan dishes.
The restaurant is named after their daughter Nilufar who manages the restaurant and is friendly. All around they serve high quality food at a great value."}
{"text":"Friendliest owner I've ever met (at least I think she's the owner). She's super chill and down to earth.

But this is a restaurant Yelp review and not Tinder so onwards!

Looking at this place from the outside, you'd think that you pretty much get what you pay for. You'd think that a $1.50 falafel will taste like a $1.50 falafel. Well fictional you is wrong! 

These falafels, shawarma, shish-taouk(sp?), etc are really good. I mean it's not Boustan's but I'd even eat here even if I was filthy rich. Which I am not. So from the point of view of a really broke student, this stuff is delicious and cheap and absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"It's not quite as cheap as it initially seems because you have to pay extra to get an all dressed pita (the regular price only includes lettuce, tomato, and tahini ; no onions, turnips, etc.) And the garlic potatoes aren't as good as Boustan. But the falafel is really good, probably better than Boustan, and it is a bit cheaper as well."}
{"text":"As stated before, the price couldn't be nicer for the special. Good variety of soups so you can try something new. The falafel itself is crispy on the outside yet moist on the inside and bursting with flavor. My only complaint was the wait. It felt like orders were being taken and processed in slow motion. The cashier was very friendly and helpful otherwise."}
{"text":"Cant complain for the price! 1.50$ for a falafel, much better than paying close to 10$ for one at green panther (although it is better overall) My one complaint is that the women at the counter is always on the phone! I dont really care but it can be annoying."}
{"text":"Ristorant√© delicieux et pas cher! La serveuse du vendredi soir est super sympatoche, je recommande fortement."}
{"text":"As a fairly cheap and broke Concordia student, I like this place. I REALLY like this place.

The 2$ trio became 2.50$ trio (including cheap drink in a styrofoam cup, a falafel sandwich and a soup of your choice). It is THE best quality/price Lebanese restaurant I ever set foot in.

Granted, the portions seem smaller than other Lebanese restaurants but it's still at a higher quantity/price ratio that I've ever seen. The pitas are the freshest I've ever tasted and the service is fairly fast. The lady at the counter seems hateful towards life but is actually really friendly if you bother to throw more than a \"Hi I'd like X, Y and Z please\" at her.

The place is kind of small and cramped but with those prices, it's to be expected. The chairs at the tables seemed to have been stolen at a local daycare center and the tables wobble.

Recommended. :)"}
{"text":"Incredible service from the most friendly staff. Food is incredible, always super fresh and made with love. Vegan or not, there are plenty of options for everyone. Great for any with special diet. #falafelforlife"}
{"text":"$3 for a truly delicious falafel wrap, a soup (or salad), each of which alone I'd pay that price for, and a juice to boot. Does it get better than that? No, it really doesn't.

This place makes me wish I lived in Montreal, just so I could come here all the time."}
{"text":"Must certainly be the best $1.29 lunch in North America.

I had a falafel. It was small, yes, but really enough and quite good. 

If I lived in the neighborhood, I would go here all the time."}
{"text":"A gem of a spot that easily merits five stars in spite of its below-street level location and limited (and that's putting it nicely) decor and ambiance... that's saying something!

Nilufar features amazing, friendly staff and a small yet delicious menu of Middle Eastern foods prepared fresh daily.  Basic falafel wraps start around $1.29 and trend upward based on what you add to them (eggplant, fries, sauces, etc.), and while they are quite decent in their own right, the real star at Nilufar are the soups - spicy Tunisian, barley and ginger, and several others make up a usual rotation of absolutely delicious options served in extremely generous portions that put trendier spots located closer to the downtown core to shame.

You can eat *very* well here for under $10.  And eat here, you should."}
{"text":"Defiantly good bang for your buck but if you don't want something that's been sitting around for a whole ask for it fresh."}
{"text":"I've had terrible meals at twice the cost in the Concordia area for similar food (La Ficelle).
The great thing about this place is the price, it's 30-40 % cheaper than elsewhere,  portions are 20% smaller and the food is not amazing, but you kind of know that going in.

How they can survive downtown rent prices with their menu offerings is beyond me. 
Their decor is student friendly and the people behind the cash are very nice. 

You kind of get what you pay for, but for those without a big appetite and a small budget, it's a good option.
But just don't expect the greatest shish taouk plate and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Decent place, obviously can't expect ambiance because of the cheap nature of the menu. This is the ideal place for broke college students and the owner herself serves you and takes orders. Prices range from $2-$5 for full meals. I personally don't find one falafel pita to be satisfying so keep in mind if you're going in hungry it will be a minimum of $5 required to make you feel full. The quality of the actual food isn't exactly anything worth mentioning but for the price it is good."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, I've only been there twice but I'll definitely be going more often. They offer really affordable food (very suitable for students) and they're really good! Super vegetarian-friendly (and vegan as well, since they've asked me if I want the sauce vegan) as well, which always makes me happy. The cashier lady is a pleasure to always see, she's very friendly and fun to talk to. The place is a little small but the rotation is fast and it's good to take away food as well. Overall, it's going to be my regular go-tos from now on. I regret not going earlier!"}
{"text":"I've only been once.  I read about it in The Concordian.  I'd read that you can get a falafel sandwich with lentil soup and a cup of juice for $2 and had to see for myself.  There was a sign on the door that said, \"Vegan's delight!\"  I liked that.  The place itself is small, cozy, and looks a bit run down.  I have to admit I wasn't really compelled to sit down to enjoy my meal.  But the interior's sort of like any other place in that area.

I didn't get that $2 special though.  Upon seeing that a falafel sandwich was $1.29, I got two to go.  It came out to only $3 after taxes.  I walked back to school and ate them there.  They were truly delicious.  Cheap enough and good enough for me.  Waaaay cheaper than the falafels found around Concordia, and just as good.  I will definitely be back many times over."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Everything is cheap, delicious, and vegetarian. I couldn't ask for more.
It's a super cute restaurant, medium sized, and cash or debit only.
The lady at the cash is super welcoming and nice! She answered all my questions about the food (I am picky). 

Perfect place to grab lunch if you go to Concordia and have some time."}
{"text":"This is probably my new happy place for falafel wraps! Decided to give it a shot for lunch today and I was so surprised that it'll be that delicious and filling for so less. 

It took me 10 minutes to get there and to my surprise, it was crowded but the service was quick and efficient. The lady that served me was so nice and sweet. She also recommended that I should go for the mega falafel as it's my first time as it comes with fries. In addition, she said that I could get a choice of 3 sauces, garlic, vegan garlic and spicy. I went for the garlic sauce and it didn't disappoint. On to my first bite, I fell in love with it and oh my days, the sauces gave it a special addition as well a blast to my palette. 

The place is great to have lunch. There are many tables and I'd definitely return to try other foods on their menus but the mega falafel was the highlight of my day!"}
{"text":"The owner is amazing and friendly, the food is amazing and cheap - what else could I ask for! As a broke stupid living beside Concordia, Nilufar becomes my second home when it comes to food. The food is always fresh and did I mention CHEAP?!!!!! 
How can you have something SO amazing and mouth watering and have it be less than $2... its witchcarft.... no but really I dont care what it is, the food, the price and the amazing service is what keeps me coming back!

Also best falafs I've ever had in my life. No Big Deal."}
{"text":"After a long search for the perfect falafel sandwich, I am happy to say that I have finally found it, my search is over; thanks in great part to the Yelp community and thanks in part to being 6 months pregnant and having an intense and unquenchable falafel craving. Nilufar, herself, greeted me as soon as I entered her restaurant. She is a beautiful woman with a lovely smile and she is really friendly despite busily manning the counter all by herself. 

Her falafel sandwich is wonderful: hot and flavorful! The tzatziki sauce is so wonderfully cool and luscious and the hummus is so creamy I was half-convinced she must add heavy cream to her garbanzo beans. Best of all, I ate like a queen for about $3. If I lived closer to Nilufar, I promise you, I would be here every other day!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment the food was terrible. Where do I begin well the hummus was tasteless as like they  just ground chickpeas up that is it there was no garlic, tahini, cumin or olive oil. There was zero taste I mean zero taste. The rice was the the same thing flat zero taste just plain boiled rice. The tabouli looked great but no taste to it but parsley. I have made tabouli myself there was no lemon taste or olive oil or garlic  not even a bit of  mint to kick it up a notch. The shawarma was the biggest problem on the plate finally something with some taste Way Too much taste all I could taste was salt like a lot of salt as if a whole  cup full was poured in it. It was so bad I threw out half the meal. I work for 28 years in a Lebanese restaurant i know what the food should taste like seem a lot people in Montreal do not or a least those that love this place don't."}
{"text":"Cheap meals though i stopped going there once i found hair in my soup. Sketchy place to hangout."}
{"text":"We loved this place. The food is excellent, the prices are low and the staff is friendly. Go--you will love it."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough of food choices in Downtown Montreal. In terms the price and taste, no complaints there. Not much of an ambiance but the staff and food make up for it. I wish they'd open more locations around the city."}
{"text":"A full and satisfying meal for under $6?  Yup this is the place.  Don't expect anything fancy in the way of the d√©cor - it looks like a fast food space, but the food and the service are lovely.

A falafel plate for under $6 can be found here.  Seriously you can't go wrong.  Fill up your belly and be pleasantly surprised that the service here is probably one of the best I've encountered.  the lady (I really wish I knew her name) is so genuinely nice and friendly and talkative (in a good way, not an annoying way) makes it a great experience.

While waiting for my food I was just sitting and watching her interact with her customers - even those that took their time deciding what to have - she was always friendly and pleasant.

You can do take-out or order/pick-up here.  When back in Montreal, for some cheap eats I will definitely stop in here."}
{"text":"Finding healthy eats is challenging these days unless you're willing to pay a premium price.  Restaurant Nilufar bucks that trend by delivering simple and healthy middle eastern cuisine at a great value.

Small and unassuming, the restaurant is a no frills establishment within walking distance of Concordia. The owners are friendly and prices start at less than $2 for a wrap.  A satisfying lunch with a drink can be had for less than $6 and a massive amount of food can be yours for less than $10 bucks.

The vegetarian falafel wrap is some of the best food you can get in Montreal for under $2 bucks. Two crispy on the outside moist on the inside falafels wrapped in a flour tortilla filled with shredded lettuce and then topped with tahini sauce and add hummus, babaganoush, or another spread for a bit extra.

If a wrap isn't going to cut it for you, then go for a hearty plate of rice, nan bread and a variety of middle eastern sides and mains, many of which are displayed in the deli counter and look delightful.  

The focus here is on great food at a great value, everything else is just a distraction."}
{"text":"SOUP. FALAFEL. DRINK. $2 (+tax).

It's not a big falafel, and the quality is no Boustan, but it's still two dollars for a full meal. Not to be messed with."}
{"text":"Nilufar is an incredible place to grab a bite to eat if you are downtown. I've been living in Montreal for 4 years and I've never found a place so cheap with such delicious food. For less than $5, you can get a falafel wrap, a soup and a juice. I can't say enough good things about this place. The owner, Nilufar, is hilarious and so sweet. 

I've never had a less than stellar experience here."}
{"text":"The best falafel ever, pita is a little hard to chew off (maybe been sitting for a while) but if they could heat it up in the grill before serving that would be amazing. Other than that, can't go wrong for a 1.69$ falafel, its sooo flavoured!"}
{"text":"How had I not discovered the $2 trio earlier? I will soon be duchess no doubt. The windows that line the front of the restaurant allow plenty of light despite it being slightly lower than street level. The cashier was a doll and you could tell by listening to her interactions with regulars that she's part of the charm and reason for the repeat business. I splurged the extra 25 cents for garlic sauce in my wrap and I would suggest you do the same. I was impressed at the significant choice of soups and was pleasantly surprised that they make a point of serving the juice in a larger-than-normal styrofoam cup rather than something that doesn't hold more than a juice-box. You won't find a better lunch for $2, that I can guarantee."}
{"text":"Cash only or minimum payment of $2 if you want to use your debit card. No other means for payment. :( took over 10 minutes to process my order although I did change it.. Kind of a busy place and only 1 person processing those orders in the kitchen and 1 person at the cash so service is slow but very friendly. Hence, one star off for those reasons.. 

Amazing falafel - bit crunchy.. Nice cumin flavor :)
Shish taouk was great, too! 

Fascinating menu + Really amazing prices. Will definitely come again to sample other items from the menu, especially, the soups!"}
{"text":"Nilufar is a great place for when you're near Concordia, and you don't want to spend a lot of money.  I don't think you can get a cheaper falafel pita in Montreal.  The food is actually quite good.  And the woman who usually works there is very friendly.

The food is good, and a little surprising.  For example, they have a few middle-eastern soups, and they seem to be homemade.  That's extremely rare for a place in this price range.

This is one of my favorite places to eat lunch."}
{"text":"I got introduced to this restaurant a few years ago when I worked in the area and I literally go out of my way to come eat here. The best way to describe it is homemade comfort food. My favorite is the shish taouk (chicken) sandwich. The combination of spiced chicken and garlic sauce is addicting. I always have it with the barley ginger soup too which has literally cured my colds on more than one occasion. The woman at the counter is one of the coolest people in the city. She has a larger than life personality and will both serve you a delicious lunch and solve all your problems in one shot."}
{"text":"truly the best falafel. wonderfully spiced and always fresh out of the fryer (yes, that means you'll have to wait a few minutes for your order). Nilufar herself works the counter and she's such a gem - always remembers you and your order. 
I always get takeout but there are several tables for those eating in.  
gluten-free friendly!
p.s. you can always ask for have extra falafel balls in your sandwich/with your meal!!! I think they're 50 cents a piece."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've ever had. Not 100% vegan but they have so many vegan options I always feel satisfied when I go. And omg the prices? They've mastered portion size and simple cooking and have managed to keep the prices perfect for students and people on a small budget. My only complaint is the waste factor. I'd be willing to add a few extra dollars to do away with the styrofoam...or I'd love to see some sort of alternative packaging model put in place (ie bring your own container etc)."}
{"text":"Very affordable and good food. It's not a place where you go for fancy dates but it will keep you well fed when you are a student and are running low on money.
The staff behaviour is good and is in a good location."}
{"text":"I'm on my way to Concordia and hungry when I passed Nilufar. Having remembered getting decent $0.99 falafel there a while back I decided to try it for something more substantial. I ordered a shish taouk platter that came quickly enough, and it wasn't terrible. Really, the best part about it was that it was $6.75 after tax which is amazing for any meal. Not the most amazing shish taouk I've ever had, but I'd definitely go back,"}
{"text":"The falafel they have is delicious and juicy. The price is great for this little gem. I know this place for almost 10 years. I always come back when I miss the Lebanese Falafel. It is not exactly like the Leb one but the best I can get here."}
{"text":"J'ai h√©sit√© tr√®s longtemps √† essayer cette place parce qu'elle avait l'air louche....et je le regrette √©norm√©ment! L'assiette falafel √† 5.49$ est un excellent qualit√©/prix....4 falafels/salade taboul√©/humus/pita/salade verte...vraiment dure √† battre pour le prix!!!"}
{"text":"Nilufar is hands down one of my all-time favourite restaurants in Montreal. Just looking at the photos on their Yelp page is making my mouth water!

I first came across these guys, as many do, when I was a student at Concordia. I lived half a block away and I am not exaggerating when I say that I ate here probably 5 times a week. Their falafel wrap, soup and drink combo is so affordable that it's hard (impossible) to pass it up on the walk home from school.

Fast forward five years, and although I no longer live downtown and no longer have the same limited student food budget, but I am *still* constantly looking for an excuse to hit up Nilufar! For starters, the service is incredible! Have you ever met a restaurant employee who knows all of their customers by first and last name? Not only does this bring a community aspect to the restaurant (somehow, in the middle of downtown Montreal), but it also makes you feel like your business is appreciated.

Second, their falafel is absolutely incredible. They're always, always super fresh -- which is huge when it comes to what makes a good falafel. Even when I've gone to more expensive Middle Eastern restaurants, I haven't found a falafel this crisp and tasty.

Finally, they're so attentive to food allergies and dietary preferences. Vegan? No problem. Gluten free? They have you covered. Paleo? I'm sure they can help you out.

Whether you're a student or not, do yourself a favour and pick up a Nilufar falafel ASAP."}
{"text":"Nifular was a godsend for me when I was studying at Dawson. The prices are so ridiculously good, I hardly ever leave the restaurant having payed more than 5$ and it's way more filling (and healthier) than anything I could get on the value menu at McDo or the likes. My favourite is their mega falafel (the regular falafel pita.... BUT WITH FRIES INSIDE), I have it nearly every time with their garlic sauce and spicy sauce, sooo good and only 2,50$. 
The only reason why I'm not putting 5 stars is because the portions could be bigger and I've had some pretty inconsistent experiences with how the pitas were arranged inside (lacking certain ingredients, falafels stuffed at the very bottom of the wrap, ...), but when considering the price of the food, it's hardly a drawback.
P.S.: The cashier is super duper friendly, I love her. She's there every day, it's really nice to see a familiar face every time I stop by for some falafel :)"}
{"text":"Great food awesome prices and even better people so it's just my kind of place. The best falafel I've ever had and very vegetarian and vegan friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place is not that bad inside like the outside front.. The price is cheap but the food is just ok dont expect too much. Many tables in the basement store."}
{"text":"The wonderful lady who works the counter remembers my order! I've gotta be one of thousands of customers that walk in here! 

Very impressive ;)"}
